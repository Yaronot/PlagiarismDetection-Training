ROOSEVELT AS MAN OF LETTERS

In a club corner, just after Roosevelt's death, the question was asked whether his memory would
not fade away, when the living man, with his vivid personality, had gone. But no: that personality
had stamped itself too deeply on the mind of his generation to be forgotten. Too many observers
have recorded their impressions; and already a dozen biographies and memoirs have appeared.
Besides, he is his own recorder. He published twenty-six books, a catalogue of which any professional
author might be proud; and a really wonderful feat when it is remembered that he wrote them
in the intervals of an active public career as Civil Service Commissioner, Police Commissioner,
member of his state legislature, Governor of New York, delegate to the National Republican
Convention, Colonel of Rough Riders, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Vice-President and President
of the United States.

Perhaps in some distant future he may become a myth or symbol, like other mighty hunters of
the beast, Nimrod and Orion and Tristram of Lyonesse. Yet not so long as "African Game Trails"
and the "Hunting Trips of a Ranchman" endure, to lift the imagination to those noble sports
denied to the run of mortals by poverty, feebleness, timidity, the engrossments of the humdrum,
everyday life, or lack of enterprise and opportunity. Old scraps of hunting song thrill us
with the great adventure: "In the wild chamois' track at break of day"; "We'll chase the antelope
over the plain"; "Afar in the desert I love to ride"; and then we go out and shoot at a woodchuck,
with an old double-barrelled shotgun--and miss! If Roosevelt ever becomes a poet, it is while
he is among the wild creatures and wild landscapes that he loved: in the gigantic forests of
Brazil, or the almost unnatural nature of the Rockies and the huge cattle ranches of the plains,
or on the limitless South African veldt, which is said to give a greater feeling of infinity
than the ocean even.

Roosevelt was so active a person--not to say so noisy and conspicuous; he so occupied the centre
of every stage, that, when he died, it was as though a wind had fallen, a light had gone out,
a military band had stopped playing. It was not so much the death of an individual as a general
lowering in the vitality of the nation. America was less America, because he was no longer
here. He should have lived twenty years more had he been willing to go slow, to loaf and invite
his soul, to feed that mind of his in a wise passiveness. But there was no repose about him,
and his pleasures were as strenuous as his toils. John Burroughs tells us that he did not care
for fishing, the contemplative man's recreation. No contemplation for him, but action; no angling
in a clear stream for a trout or grayling; but the glorious, dangerous excitement of killing
big game--grizzlies, lions, African buffaloes, mountain sheep, rhinoceroses, elephants. He
never spared himself: he wore himself out. But doubtless he would have chosen the crowded hour
of glorious life--or strife, for life and strife were with him the same.

He was above all things a fighter, and the favorite objects of his denunciation were professional
pacifists, nice little men who had let their muscles get soft, and nations that had lost their
fighting edge. Aggressive war, he tells us in "The Winning of the West," is not always bad.
"Americans need to keep in mind the fact that, as a nation, they have erred far more often
in not being willing enough to fight than in being too willing." "Cowardice," he writes elsewhere,
"in a race, as in an individual, is the unpardonable sin." Is this true? Cowardice is a weakness,
perhaps a disgraceful weakness: a defect of character which makes a man contemptible, just
as foolishness does. But it is not a sin at all, and surely not an unpardonable one. Cruelty,
treachery, and ingratitude are much worse traits, and selfishness is as bad. I have known very
good men who were cowards; men that I liked and trusted but who, from weakness of nerves or
other physical causes--perhaps from prenatal influences--were easily frightened and always
constitutionally timid. The Colonel was a very pugnacious man: he professed himself to be a
lover of peace--and so did the Kaiser--but really he enjoyed the gaudium certaminis, as all
bold spirits do.

In the world-wide sense of loss which followed his death, some rather exaggerated estimates
made themselves heard. A preacher announced that there had been only two great Americans, one
of whom was Theodore Roosevelt. An editor declared that the three greatest Americans were Washington,
Lincoln, and Roosevelt. But not all great Americans have been in public life; and, of those
who have, very few have been Presidents of the United States. What is greatness? Roosevelt
himself rightly insists on character as the root of the matter. Still character alone does
not make a man great. There are thousands of men in common life, of sound and forceful character,
who never become great, who are not even potentially great. To make them such, great abilities
are needed, as well as favoring circumstances. In his absolute manner--a manner caught perhaps
partly from Macaulay, for whose qualities as a writer he had a high and, I think, well-justified
regard--he pronounces Cromwell the greatest Englishman of the seventeenth century. Was he so?
He was the greatest English soldier and magistrate of that century; but how about Bacon and
Newton, about Shakespeare and Milton?

Let us think of a few other Americans who, in their various fields, might perhaps deserve to
be entitled great. Shall we say Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John
Marshall, Robert Fulton, S. F. B. Morse, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Daniel Webster, Horace Greeley,
Henry Ward Beecher, Admiral Farragut, General W. T. Sherman, James Russell Lowell, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, General Robert E. Lee? None of these people were Presidents of the United States.
But to the man in the street there is something imposing about the office and title of a chief
magistrate, be he emperor, king, or elected head of a republic. It sets him apart. Look at
the crowds that swarm to get a glimpse of the President when he passes through, no matter whether
it is George Washington or Franklin Pierce.

It might be safer, on the whole, to say that the three names in question are those of our greatest
presidents, not of the greatest Americans. And even this comparison might be questioned. Some,
for example, might assert the claims of Thomas Jefferson to rank with the others. Jefferson
was a man of ideas who made a strong impression on his generation. He composed the Declaration
of Independence and founded the Democratic party and the University of Virginia. He had a more
flexible mind than Washington, though not such good judgment; and he had something of Roosevelt's
alert interest in a wide and diversified range of subjects. But the latter had little patience
with Jefferson. He may have respected him as the best rider and pistol shot in Virginia; but
in politics he thought him a theorist and doctrinaire imbued with the abstract notions of the
French philosophical deists and democrats. Jefferson, he thought, knew nothing and cared nothing
about military affairs. He let the army run down and preferred to buy Louisiana rather than
conquer it, while he dreamed of universal fraternity and was the forerunner of the Dove of
Peace and the League of Nations.

Roosevelt, in fact, had no use for philosophy or speculative thought which could not be reduced
to useful action. He was an eminently practical thinker. His mind was without subtlety, and
he had little imagination. A life of thought for its own sake; the life of a dreamer or idealist;
a life like that of Coleridge, with his paralysis of will and abnormal activity of the speculative
faculty, eternally spinning metaphysical cobwebs, doubtless seemed to the author of "The Strenuous
Life" a career of mere self-indulgence. It is not without significance that, with all his passion
for out of doors, for wild life and the study of bird and beast, he nowhere, so far as I can
remember, mentions Thoreau,[A] who is far and away our greatest nature writer. Doubtless he
may have esteemed him as a naturalist, but not as a transcendentalist or as an impracticable
faddist who refused to pay taxes because Massachusetts enforced the fugitive slave law. We
are told that his fellow historian, Francis Parkman, had a contempt for philosophers like Emerson
and Thoreau and an admiration for writers such as Scott and Cooper who depicted scenes of bold
adventure. The author of "The Oregon Trail" and the author of "African Game Trails" had a good
deal in common, especially great force of will--you see it in Parkman's jaw. He was a physical
wreck and did his work under almost impossible conditions; while Roosevelt had built up an
originally sickly constitution into a physique of splendid vigor.

Towards the critical intellect, as towards the speculative, Roosevelt felt an instinctive antagonism.
One of his most characteristic utterances is the address delivered at the Sorbonne, April 30,
1910, "Citizenship in a Republic." Here, amidst a good deal of moral commonplace--wise and
sensible for the most part, but sufficiently platitudinous--occurs a burst of angry eloquence.
For he was always at his strongest when scolding somebody. His audience included the intellectual
élite of France; and he warns it against the besetting sin of university dons and the learned
and lettered class in general, a supercilious, patronizing attitude towards the men of action
who are doing the rough work of the world. Critics are the object of his fiercest denunciation.

The speaker had seemingly himself been stung by criticism; or he was reacting against Matthew
Arnold, the celebrated "Harvard indifference," and the cynical talk of the clubs.

We do not expect our Presidents to be literary men and are correspondingly gratified when any
of them shows signs of almost human intelligence in spheres outside of politics. Of them all,
none touched life at so many points, or was so versatile, picturesque, and generally interesting
a figure as the one who has just passed away. Washington was not a man of books. A country
gentleman, a Virginia planter and slave-owner, member of a landed aristocracy, he had the limited
education of his class and period. Rumor said that he did not write his own messages. And there
is a story that John Quincy Adams, regarding a portrait of the father of his country, exclaimed,
"To think that that old wooden head will go down in history as a great man!" But this was the
comment of a Boston Brahmin, and all the Adamses had bitter tongues. Washington was, of course,
a very great man, though not by virtue of any intellectual brilliancy, but of his strong character,
his immense practical sagacity and common sense, his leadership of men.

As to Lincoln, we know through what cold obstruction he struggled up into the light, educating
himself to be one of the soundest statesmen and most effective public speakers of his day--or
any day. There was an inborn fineness or sensitiveness in Lincoln, a touch of the artist (he
even wrote verses) which contrasts with the phlegm of his illustrious contemporary, General
Grant. The latter had a vein of coarseness, of commonness rather, in his nature; evidenced
by his choice of associates and his entire indifference to "the things of the mind." He was
almost illiterate and only just a gentleman. Yet by reason of his dignified modesty and simplicity,
he contrived to write one of the best of autobiographies.

Roosevelt had many advantages over his eminent predecessors. Of old Knickerbocker stock, with
a Harvard education, and the habit of good society, he had means enough to indulge in his favorite
pastimes. To run a cattle ranch in Dakota, lead a hunting party in Africa and an exploring
expedition in Brazil, these were wide opportunities, but he fully measured up to them. Mr.
W. H. Hays, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said of him, "He had more knowledge
about more things than any other man." Well, not quite that. We have all known people who made
a specialty of omniscience. If a man can speak two languages besides his own and can read two
more fairly well, he is at once credited with knowing half a dozen foreign tongues as well
as he knows English. Let us agree, however, that Roosevelt knew a lot about a lot of things.
He was a rapid and omnivorous reader, reading a book with his finger tips, gutting it of its
contents, as he did the birds that he shot, stuffed, and mounted; yet not inappreciative of
form, and accustomed to recommend much good literature to his countrymen. He took an eager
interest in a large variety of subjects, from Celtic poetry and the fauna and flora of many
regions to simplified spelling and the split infinitive.

A young friend of mine was bringing out, for the use of schools and colleges, a volume of selections
from the English poets, all learnedly annotated, and sent me his manuscript to look over. On
a passage about the bittern bird he had made this note, "The bittern has a harsh, throaty cry."
Whereupon I addressed him thus: "Throaty nothing! You are guessing, man. If Teddy Roosevelt
reads your book--and he reads everything--he will denounce you as a nature faker and put you
down for membership in the Ananias Club. Recall what he did to Ernest Seton-Thompson and to
that minister in Stamford, Connecticut. Remember how he crossed swords with Mr. Scully touching
the alleged dangerous nature of the ostrich and the early domestication of the peacock. So
far as I know, the bittern thing has no voice at all. His real stunt is as follows. He puts
his beak down into the swamp, in search of insects and snails or other marine life--est-ce
que je sais?--and drawing in the bog-water through holes in his beak, makes a booming sound
which is most impressive. Now do not think me an ornithologist or a bird sharp. Personally
I do not know a bittern from an olive-backed thrush. But I have read some poetry, and I remember
what Thomson says in 'The Seasons':

     The bittern knows his time with bill ingulf'd
     To shake the sounding marsh.

See also 'The Lady of the Lake':

     And the bittern sound his drum,
     Booming from the sedgy shallow.

See even old Chaucer who knew a thing or two about birds, teste his 'Parlament of Foules,'
admirably but strangely edited by Lounsbury, whose indifference to art was only surpassed by
his hostility to nature. Says Chaucer:

     And as a bytoure bumblith in the myre."

My friend canceled his note. It is, of course, now established that the bittern "booms"--not
in the mud--but in the air.

Mr. Roosevelt was historian, biographer, essayist, and writer of narrative papers on hunting,
outdoor life, and natural history, and in all these departments did solid, important work.
His "Winning of the West" is little, if at all, inferior in historical interest to the similar
writings of Parkman and John Fiske. His "History of the Naval War of 1812" is an astonishing
performance for a young man of twenty-four, only two years out of college. For it required
a careful sifting of evidence and weighing of authorities. The job was done with patient thoroughness,
and the book is accepted, I believe, as authoritative. It is to me a somewhat tedious tale.
One sea fight is much like another, a record of meaningless slaughter.

Of the three lives, those of Gouverneur Morris, T. H. Benton, and Oliver Cromwell, I cannot
speak with confidence, having read only the last. I should guess that the life of Benton was
written more con amore than the others, for the frontier was this historian's favorite scene.
The life of Cromwell is not so much a formal biography as a continuous essay in interpretation
of a character still partly enigmatic in spite of all the light that so many acute psychologists
have shed upon it. It is a relief to read for once a book which is without preface, footnote,
or reference. It cannot be said that the biographer contributes anything very new to our knowledge
of his subject. The most novel features of his work are the analogies that he draws between
situations in English and American political history. These are usually ingenious and illuminating,
sometimes a little misleading; as where he praises Lincoln's readiness to acquiesce in the
result of the election in 1864 and to retire peaceably in favor of McClellan; contrasting it
with Cromwell's dissolution of his Parliaments and usurpation of the supreme power. There was
a certain likeness in the exigencies, to be sure, but a broad difference between the problems
confronting the two rulers. Lincoln was a constitutional President with strictly limited powers,
bound by usage and precedent. For him to have kept his seat by military force, in defiance
of a Democratic majority, would have been an act of treason. But the Lord Protector held a
new office, unknown to the old constitution of England and with ill-defined powers. A revolution
had tossed him to the top and made him dictator. He was bound to keep the peace in unsettled
times, to keep out the Stuarts, to keep down the unruly factions. If Parliament would not help,
he must govern without it. Carlyle thought that he had no choice.

Roosevelt's addresses, essays, editorials, and miscellaneous papers, which fill many volumes,
are seldom literary in subject, and certainly not in manner. He was an effective speaker and
writer, using plain, direct, forcible English, without any graces of style. In these papers
he is always the moralist, earnest, high-minded, and the preacher of many gospels: the gospel
of the strenuous life; the gospel of what used to be called "muscular Christianity"; the gospel
of large families; of hundred per cent Americanism; and, above all, of military preparedness.
I am not here concerned with the President's political principles, nor with the specific measures
that he advocated. I will only say, to guard against suspicion of unfair prejudice, that, as
a Democrat, a freetrader, a state-rights man, individualist, and anti-imperialist, I naturally
disapproved of many acts of his administration, of the administration of his predecessor, and
of his party in general. I disapproved, and still do, of the McKinley and Payne-Aldrich tariffs;
of the Spanish war--most avoidable of wars--with its sequel, the conquest of the Philippines;
above all, of the seizure of the Panama Canal zone.

But let all that pass: I am supposed to be dealing with my subject as man of letters. As such
the Colonel of the Rough Riders was the high commander-in-chief of rough writers. He never
persuaded his readers into an opinion--he bullied them into it. When he gnashed his big teeth
and shook his big stick,

     ... The bold Ascalonite
     Fled from his iron ramp; old warriors turned
     Their plated backs under his heel;

mollycoddles, pussy-footers, professional pacifists, and nice little men who had lost their
fighting edge, all scuttled to cover. He called names, he used great violence of language.
For instance, a certain president of a woman's college had "fatuously announced ... that it
was better to have one child brought up in the best way than several not thus brought up."
The woman making this statement, wrote the Colonel, "is not only unfit to be at the head of
a female college, but is not fit to teach the lowest class in a kindergarten; for such teaching
is not merely folly, but a peculiarly repulsive type of mean and selfish wickedness." And again:
"The man or woman who deliberately avoids marriage ... is in effect a criminal against the
race and should be an object of contemptuous abhorrence by all healthy people."

Now, I am not myself an advocate of race suicide but I confess to a feeling of sympathy with
the lady thus denounced, whose point of view is, at least, comprehensible. Old Malthus was
not such an ass as some folks think. It is impossible not to admire Roosevelt's courage, honesty,
and wonderful energy: impossible to keep from liking the man for his boyish impulsiveness,
camaraderie, sporting blood, and hatred of a rascal. But it is equally impossible for a man
of any spirit to keep from resenting his bullying ways, his intolerance of quiet, peaceable
people and persons of an opposite temperament to his own. Even nice, timid little men who have
let their bodies get soft do not like to be bullied. It puts their backs up. His ideal of character
was manliness, a sound ideal, but he insisted too much upon the physical side of it, "red-bloodedness"
and all that. Those poor old fat generals in Washington who had been enjoying themselves at
their clubs, playing bridge and drinking Scotch highballs! He made them all turn out and ride
fifty miles a day.

Mr. Roosevelt produced much excellent literature, but no masterpieces like Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address and Second Inaugural. Probably his sketches of ranch life and of hunting trips in three
continents will be read longest and will keep their freshness after the public questions which
he discussed have lost interest and his historical works have been in part rewritten. In these
outdoor papers, besides the thrilling adventures which they--very modestly--record, there are
even passages of descriptive beauty and chapters of graphic narrative, like the tale of the
pursuit and capture of the three robbers who stole the boats on the Missouri River, which belonged
to the Roosevelt ranch. This last would be a capital addition to school readers and books of
selected standard prose.

Senator Lodge and other friends emphasize the President's sense of humor. He had it, of course.
He took pains to establish the true reading of that famous retort, "All I want out of you is
common civility and damned little of that." He used to repeat with glee Lounsbury's witticism
about "the infinite capability of the human mind to resist the introduction of knowledge."
I wonder whether he knew of that other good saying of Lounsbury's about the historian Freeman's
being, in his own person, a proof of the necessity of the Norman Conquest. He had, at all events,
a just and high estimate of the merits of my brilliant colleague. But Roosevelt was not himself
a humorist, and his writings give little evidence of his possession of the faculty. Lincoln,
now, was one of the foremost American humorists. But Roosevelt was too strenuous for the practice
of humor, which implies a certain relaxation of mind: a detachment from the object of immediate
pursuit: a superiority to practical interests which indulges itself in the play of thought;
and, in the peculiarly American form of it, a humility which inclines one to laugh at himself.
Impossible to fancy T. R. making the answer that Lincoln made to an applicant for office: "I
haven't much influence with this administration." As for that variety of humor that is called
irony, it demands a duplicity which the straight-out-speaking Roosevelt could not practise.
He was like Epaminondas in the Latin prose composition book, who was such a lover of truth
that he never told a falsehood even in jest--ne joco quidem.

The only instance of his irony that I recall--there may be others--is the one recorded by Mr.
Leupp in his reply to Senator Gorman, who had charged that the examiners of the Civil Service
Commission had turned down "a bright young man" in the city of Baltimore, an applicant for
the position of letter-carrier, "because he could not tell the most direct route from Baltimore
to Japan." Hereupon the young Civil Service Commissioner challenged the senator to verify his
statement, but Mr. Gorman preserved a dignified silence. Excellent fooling, but a bit too long
and heavy-handed for the truest ironic effect.

Many of our Presidents, however little given to the use of the pen, have been successful coiners
of phrases--phrases that have stuck: "entangling alliances," "era of good feeling," "innocuous
desuetude," "a condition, not a theory." Lincoln was happiest at this art, and there is no
need to mention any of the scores of pungent sayings which he added to the language and which
are in daily use. President Roosevelt was no whit behind in this regard. All recognize and
remember the many phrases to which he gave birth or currency: "predatory wealth," "bull moose,"
"hit the line hard," "weasel words," "my hat is in the ring," and so on. He took a humorous
delight in mystifying the public with recondite allusions, sending everyone to the dictionary
to look out "Byzantine logothete," and to the Bible and cyclopedia to find Armageddon.

Roosevelt is alleged to have had a larger personal following than any other man lately in public
life. What a testimony to his popularity is the "teddy bear"; and what a sign of the universal
interest, hostile or friendly, which he excited in his contemporaries, is the fact that Mr.
Albert Shaw was able to compile a caricature life of him presenting many hundred pictures!
There was something German about Roosevelt's standards. In this last war he stood heart and
soul for America and her allies against Germany's misconduct. But he admired the Germans' efficiency,
their highly organized society, their subordination of the individual to the state. He wanted
to Prussianize this great peaceful republic by introducing universal obligatory military service.
He insisted, like the Germans, upon the Hausfrau's duty to bear and rear many children. If
he had been a German, it seems possible that, with his views as to the right of strong races
to expand, by force if necessary, he might have justified the seizure of Silesia, the partition
of Poland, the Drang nach Osten, and maybe even the invasion of Belgium--as a military measure.

And so of religion and the church, which Germans regard as a department of government. Our
American statesman, of course, was firmly in favor of the separation of church and state and
of universal toleration. But he advises everyone to join the church, some church, any old church;
not because one shares its beliefs--creeds are increasingly unimportant--but because the church
is an instrument of social welfare, and a man can do more good in combination with his fellows
than when he stands alone. There is much truth in this doctrine, though it has a certain naïveté,
when looked at from the standpoint of the private soul and its spiritual needs.

As in the church, so in the state, he stood for the associative principle as opposed to an
extreme individualism. He was a practical politician and therefore an honest partisan, feeling
that he could work more efficiently for good government within party lines than outside them.
He resigned from the Free Trade League because his party was committed to the policy of protection.
In 1884 he supported his party's platform and candidate, instead of joining the Mugwumps and
voting for Cleveland, though at the National Republican Convention, to which he went as a delegate,
he had opposed the nomination of Blaine. I do not believe that his motive in this decision
was selfish, or that he quailed under the snap of the party lash because he was threatened
with political death in case he disobeyed. Theodore Roosevelt was nobody's man. He thought,
as he frankly explained, that one who leaves his faction for every slight occasion, loses his
influence and his power for good. Better to compromise, to swallow some differences and to
stick to the crowd which, upon the whole and in the long run, embodies one's convictions. This
is a comprehensible attitude, and possibly it is the correct one for the man in public life
who is frequently a candidate for office. Yet I wish he could have broken with his party and
voted for Cleveland. For, ironically enough, it was Roosevelt himself who afterward split his
party and brought in Wilson and the Democrats.

Disregarding his political side and considering him simply as man of letters, one seeks for
comparisons with other men of letters who were at once big sportsmen and big writers; Christopher
North, for example: "Christopher in his Aviary" and "Christopher in his Shooting Jacket." The
likeness here is only a very partial one, to be sure. The American was like the Scotchman in
his athleticism, high spirits, breezy optimism, love of the open air, intense enjoyment of
life. But he had not North's roystering conviviality and uproarious Toryism; and the kinds
of literature that they cultivated were quite unlike.

Charles Kingsley offers a closer resemblance, though the differences here are as numerous as
the analogies. Roosevelt was not a clergyman, and not a creative writer, a novelist, or poet.
His temperament was not very similar to Kingsley's. Yet the two shared a love for bold adventure,
a passion for sport, and an eager interest in the life of animals and plants. Sport with Kingsley
took the shape of trout fishing and of riding to hounds, not of killing lions with the rifle.
He was fond of horses and dogs; associated democratically with gamekeepers, grooms, whippers-in,
poachers even; as Roosevelt did with cowboys, tarpon fishers, wilderness guides, beaters, trappers,
and all whom Walt Whitman calls "powerful uneducated persons," loving them for their pluck,
coolness, strength, and skill. Kingsley's "At Last, a Christmas in the West Indies," exhibits
the same curiosity as to tropical botany and zoology that Roosevelt shows in his African and
Brazilian journeys. Not only tastes, but many ideals and opinions the two men had in common.
"Parson Lot," the Chartist and Christian Socialist, had the same sympathy with the poor and
the same desire to improve the condition of agricultural laborers and London artisans which
led Roosevelt to promote employers' liability laws and other legislation to protect the workingman
from exploitation by conscienceless wealth. Kingsley, like Roosevelt, was essentially Protestant.
Neither he nor Mr. Roosevelt liked asceticism or celibacy. As a historian, Kingsley did not
rank at all with the author of "The Winning of the West" and the "Naval War of 1812." On the
other hand, if Roosevelt had written novels and poetry, I think he would have rejoiced greatly
to write "Westward Ho," "The Last Buccaneer," and "Ode to the North-East Wind."

In fine, whatever lasting fortune may be in store for Roosevelt's writings, the disappearance
of his vivid figure leaves a blank in the contemporary scene. And those who were against him
can join with those who were for him in slightly paraphrasing Carlyle's words of dismissal
to Walter Scott, "Theodore Roosevelt, pride of all Americans, take our proud and sad farewell."

sentence, which I had overlooked: "As a woodland writer, Thoreau comes second only to Burroughs."--"The
Wilderness Hunter," p. 261.

FIFTY YEARS OF HAWTHORNE

Hawthorne was an excellent critic of his own writings. He recognizes repeatedly the impersonal
and purely objective nature of his fiction. R. H. Hutton once called him the ghost of New England;
and those who love his exquisite, though shadowy, art are impelled to give corporeal substance
to this disembodied spirit: to draw him nearer out of his chill aloofness, by associating him
with people and places with which they too have associations.

I heard Colonel Higginson say, in a lecture at Concord, that if a few drops of redder blood
could have been added to Hawthorne's style, he would have been the foremost imaginative writer
of his century. The ghosts in "The Æneid" were unable to speak aloud until they had drunk blood.
Instinctively, then, one seeks to infuse more red corpuscles into the somewhat anæmic veins
of these tales and romances. For Hawthorne's fiction is almost wholly ideal. He does not copy
life like Thackeray, whose procedure is inductive: does not start with observed characters,
but with an imagined problem or situation of the soul, inventing characters to fit. There is
always a dreamy quality about the action: no violent quarrels, no passionate love scenes. Thus
it has been often pointed out that in "The Scarlet Letter" we do not get the history of Dimmesdale's
and Hester's sin: not the passion itself, but only its sequels in the conscience. So in "The
House of the Seven Gables," and "The Marble Faun," a crime has preceded the opening of the
story, which deals with the working out of the retribution.

When Hawthorne handled real persons, it was in the form of the character sketch--often the
satirical character sketch,--as in the introduction to "The Scarlet Letter" which scandalized
the people of Salem. If he could have made a novel out of his custom-house acquaintances, he
might have given us something less immaterial. He felt the lack of solidity in his own creations:
the folly of constructing "the semblance of a world out of airy matter"; the "value hidden
in petty incidents and ordinary characters." "A better book than I shall ever write was there,"
he confesses, but "my brain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribe it."

Now and then, when he worked from observation, or utilized his own experiences, a piece of
drastic realism results. The suicide of Zenobia is transferred, with the necessary changes,
from a long passage in "The American Note Books," in which he tells of going out at night,
with his neighbors, to drag for the body of a girl who had drowned herself in the Concord.
Yet he did not refrain the touch of symbolism even here. There is a wound on Zenobia's breast,
inflicted by the pole with which Hollingsworth is groping the river bottom.

And this is why one finds his "American Note Books" quite as interesting reading as his stories.
Very remarkable things, these note books. They have puzzled Mr. James, who asks what the author
would be at in them, and suggests that he is writing letters to himself, or practising his
hand at description. They are not exactly a journal in-time; nor are they records of thought,
like Emerson's ten volumes of journals. They are carefully composed, and are full of hints
for plots, scenes, situations, characters, to be later worked up. In the three collections,
"Twice-Told Tales," "Mosses from an Old Manse," and "The Snow Image," there are, in round numbers,
a hundred tales and sketches; and Mr. Conway has declared that, in the number of his original
plots, no modern author, save Browning, has equalled Hawthorne. Now, the germ of many, if not
most, of these inventions may be found in some brief jotting--a paragraph, or a line or two--in
"The American Note Books."

Yet it is not as literary material that these notes engage me most--by far the greater portion
were never used,--but as records of observation and studies of life. I will even acknowledge
a certain excitement when the diarist's wanderings lead him into my own neighborhood, however
insignificant the result. Thus, in a letter from New Haven in 1830, he writes, "I heard some
of the students at Yale College conjecturing that I was an Englishman." Mr. Lathrop thinks
that it was on this trip through Connecticut that he hit upon his story, "The Seven Vagabonds,"
the scene of which is near Stamford, in the van of a travelling showman, where the seven wanderers
take shelter during a thunderstorm. How quaintly true to the old provincial life of back-country
New England are these figures--a life that survives to-day in out-of-the-way places. The Note
Books tell us that, at North Adams in 1838, the author foregathered with a surgeon-dentist,
who was also a preacher of the Baptist persuasion: and that, on the stage-coach between Worcester
and Northampton, they took up an essence-vender who was peddling anise-seed, cloves, red-cedar,
wormwood, opodeldoc, hair-oil, and Cologne water. Do you imagine that the essence-peddler is
extinct? No, you may meet his covered wagon to-day on lonely roads between the hill-villages
of Massachusetts and Connecticut.

It was while living that strange life of seclusion at Old Salem, compared with which Thoreau's
hermitage at Walden was like the central roar of Broadway, that Hawthorne broke away now and
then from his solitude, and went rambling off in search of contacts with real life. Do I not
know that wind-swept hilltop, those grassy avenues? Do I not know that ancient graveyard, and
what names are on its headstones? Yes, even as the heart knoweth its own bitterness.

As we go on in life, anniversaries become rather melancholy affairs. The turn of the year--the
annual return of the day--birthdays or death-days or set festal occasions like Christmas or
the New Year, bring reminders of loss and change. This is true of domestic anniversaries; while
public literary celebrations, designed to recall to a forgetful generation the centenary or
other dates in the lives of great writers, appear too often but milestones on the road to oblivion.
Fifty years is too short a time to establish a literary immortality; and yet, if any American
writer has already won the position of a classic, Hawthorne is that writer. Speaking in this
country in 1883, Matthew Arnold said: "Hawthorne's literary talent is of the first order. His
subjects are generally not to me subjects of the highest interest; but his literary talent
is ... the finest, I think, which America has yet produced--finer, by much, than Emerson's."
But how does the case stand to-day? I believe that Hawthorne's fame is secure as a whole, in
spite of the fact that much of his work has begun to feel the disintegrating force of hostile
criticism, and "the unimaginable touch of time."

For one thing, American fiction, for the past fifty years, has been taking a direction quite
the contrary of his. Run over the names that will readily occur of modern novelists and short-story
writers, and ask yourself whether the vivid coloring of these realistic schools must not inevitably
have blanched to a still whiter pallor those visionary tales of which the author long ago confessed
that they had "the pale tints of flowers that blossomed in too retired a shade." With practice
has gone theory; and now the critics of realism are beginning to nibble at the accepted estimates
of Hawthorne. A very damaging bit of dissection is the recent essay by Mr. W. C. Brownell,
one of the most acute and unsparingly analytic of American critics. It is full of cruelly clever
things: for example, "Zenobia and Miriam linger in one's memory rather as brunettes than as
women." And again, à propos of Roger Chillingworth in "The Scarlet Letter,"--"His characters
are not creations, but expedients." I admire these sayings; but they seem to me, like most
epigrams, brilliant statements of half-truths. In general, Mr. Brownell's thesis is that Hawthorne
was spoiled by allegory: that he abused his naturally rare gift of imagination by declining
to grapple with reality, which is the proper material for the imagination, but allowing his
fancy--an inferior faculty--to play with dreams and symbols; and that consequently he has left
but one masterpiece.

This is an old complaint. Long ago, Edgar Poe, who did not live to read "The Scarlet Letter,"
but who wrote a favorable review of "The Twice-Told Tales," advised the author to give up allegory.
In 1880, Mr. Henry James wrote a life of Hawthorne for the English Men of Letters series. This
was addressed chiefly to the English public and was thought in this country to be a trifle
unsympathetic; in particular in its patronizing way of dwelling upon the thinness of the American
social environment and the consequent provincialism of Hawthorne's books. The Folkething other wise
known as the House of Commons has 114 members elected for three years the usual way by universal
suffrage, 12 out of 66 members of the Landsthing are nominated by the crown and are life long members.Accordong
to a method of proportionate representation by a body of deputy electors the remaining 54 membors
of the Landsthing return for 8 years. Of these deputies half are choosen in the towns by those
who suring the last preceding year were assesed on a certain income, or paid atleast a certain
amount of taxes or rates. The other half of the deputy electors are elected the same way as
the members of the Folkething, without qulifications for any voters.

Deputy electors returned by election are supplemented by an equal number of votes who ever have paid
the highest amounts in country rates and taxes together, this happens in the rural districts.
In what is considered a fair ahare of influence on public affairs given to those who contribute
the most to the needs of the state, in this manner a representation is secured for fairly large
minorities. Subject to independence of public charity and certain other circustances, the
franchise is held by every male who has reached his thirtieth year. At the age of 25 you become
a candidate for either house of Rigsdag.
Members are paid ten kroner each day of the session and are allowed travelling expenses. The
houses meet each year on the first Monday in October. The constitutional theory of the Folkething
is that of one member for every 16,000 inhabitants. The FaerÃ¶e islands, which form an integral
part of the kingdom of Denmark in the wider sense, are represented in the Danish parliament,
but not the other dependencies of the Danish crown, namely Iceland, Greenland and the West
Indian islands of St Thomas, St John and St Croix. The budget is considered by the Folkething
at the beginning of each session.

The revenue and expenditure average annually about Â£4,700,000. The principal items of revenue
are customs and excise, land and house tax, stamps, railways, legal fees, the state lottery
and death duties. A considerable reserve fund is maintained to meet emergencies. The public debt
is about Â£13,500,000 and is divided into an internal debt, bearing interest generally at 3Â½%,
and a foreign debt (the larger), with interest generally at 3%. The revenue and expenditure of
the FaerÃ¶es are included in the budget for Denmark proper, but Iceland and the West Indies have
their separate budgets.
As Iceland receives an annual grant and the West Indian islands are heavily subsidized by danish
finances in the sugar industry the danish treasury receives nothing drom these possessions. Annual
loss which is posted on the budget of the ministry of finances intails the administration of
Greenland. The state council includes the presidency of the council and ministries of war,
and marine, agriculture and public works, justice, finance, and marine, the interior, ecclesiastical,
foreign affairs, and public institution.
Local Government.--For administrative purposes the country is divided into eighteen counties
(Amter, singular Amt), as follows. (1) Covering the islands of Zealand and lesser adjacent islands,
Copenhagen, Frederiksborg, Holbaek, SorÃ¶, PraestÃ¶. (2) Covering the islands of Laaland and
Falster, Maribo. (3) Covering FÃ¼nen, Langeland and adjacent islets, Svendborg, Odense. (4) On the
mainland, HjÃ¶rring, Aalborg, Thisted, RingkjÃ¶bing, Viborg, Randers, Aarhus, Vejle, Ribe. (5)
Bornholm. The principal civil officer in each of these is the Amtmand. Local affairs are managed by the
Amstraad and Sogneraad, corresponding to the English county council
and parish council.

These institutions date from 1841, but they have undergone several modifications since. The
members of these councils are elected on a system similar to that applied to the elections for
the Landsthing. The same is the case with the provincial town councils. That of Copenhagen
is elected by those who are rated on an income of at least 400 kroner
(Â£22). The burgomasters are appointed by the crown, except at Copenhagen,
where they are elected by the town council, subject to royal approbation.
 The true interpretation
of that story I have sometimes thought to be, that the woman who saw the phantoms was mad.
Hawthorne is similarly ambiguous. His apparently preternatural phenomena always admit of a
natural explanation. The water of Maule's well may have turned bitter in consequence of an
ancient wrong; but also perhaps because of a disturbance in the underground springs. The sudden
deaths of Colonel and Judge Pyncheon may have been due to the old wizard's curse that "God
would give them blood to drink"; or simply to an inherited tendency to apoplexy. Did Donatello
have furry, leaf-shaped ears, or was this merely his companions' teasing? Did old Mistress
Hibben, the sister of Governor Bellingham of Massachusetts, attend witch meetings in the forest,
and inscribe her name in the Black Man's book? Hawthorne does not say so, but only that the
people so believed; and it is historical fact that she was executed as a witch. Was a red letter
A actually seen in the midnight sky, or was it a freak of the aurora borealis? What did Chillingworth
see on Dimmesdale's breast? The author will not tell us. But if it was the mark of the Scarlet
Letter, may we not appeal to the phenomena of stigmatism: the print, for example, of the five
wounds of Christ on the bodies of devotees? Hawthorne does not vouch for the truth of Alice
Pyncheon's clairvoyant trances: he relates her story as a legend handed down in the Pyncheon
family, explicable, if you please, on natural grounds--what was witchcraft in the seventeenth
century having become mesmerism or hypnotism in the nineteenth.

Fifty years after his death, Hawthorne is already a classic. For even Mr. Brownell allows him
one masterpiece, and one masterpiece means an immortality. I suppose it is generally agreed
that "The Scarlet Letter" is his chef-d'oeuvre. Certainly it is his most intensely conceived
work, the most thoroughly fused and logically developed; and is free from those elements of
fantasy, mystery, and unreality which enter into his other romances. But its unrelieved gloom,
and the author's unrelaxing grasp upon his theme, make it less characteristic than some of
his inferior works; and I think he was right in preferring "The House of the Seven Gables,"
as more fully representing all sides of his genius. The difference between the two is the difference
between tragedy and romance. While we are riding the high horse of criticism and feeling virtuous,
we will concede the superiority of the former genre; but when we give our literary conscience
the slip, we yield ourselves again to the fascination of the haunted twilight.

The antique gabled mansion in its quiet back street has the charm of the still-life sketches
in the early books, such as "Sights from a Steeple," "A Rill from the Town Pump," "Sunday at
Home," and "The Toll-gatherer's Day." All manner of quaint figures, known to childhood, pass
along that visionary street: the scissors grinder, town crier, baker's cart, lumbering stage-coach,
charcoal vender, hand-organ man and monkey, a drove of cattle, a military parade--the "trainers,"
as we used to call them. Hawthorne had no love for his fellow citizens and took little part
in the modern society of Salem. But he had struck deep roots into the soil of the old witch
town, his birthplace and the home of generations of his ancestors. Does the reader know this
ancient seaport, with its decayed shipping and mouldering wharves, its silted up harbor and
idle custom-house, where Hawthorne served three years as surveyor of the port? Imposing still
are the great houses around the square, built by retired merchants and shipmasters whose fortunes
were made in the East India trade: with dark old drawing-rooms smelling of sandalwood and filled
with cabinets of Oriental curiosities. Hawthorne had little to do with the aristocracy of Salem.
But something of the life of these old families may be read in Mrs. Stoddard's novel "The Morgesons,"--a
book which I am perpetually recommending to my friends, and they as perpetually refusing to
read, returning my copy after a superficial perusal, with uncomplimentary comments upon my
taste in fiction.

Hawthorne's academic connections are of particular interest. It is wonderful that he and Longfellow
should have been classmates at Bowdoin. Equally wonderful that Emerson's "Nature" and Hawthorne's
"Mosses" should have been written in the same little room in the Old Manse at Concord. It gives
one a sense of how small New England was then, and in how narrow a runway genius went. Bowdoin
College in those days was a little country school on the edge of the Maine wilderness, only
twenty years old, its few buildings almost literally planted down among the pine stumps. Hawthorne's
class--1825--graduated but thirty-seven strong. And yet Hawthorne and Longfellow were not intimate
in college but belonged to different sets. And twelve years afterward, when Longfellow wrote
a friendly review of "Twice-Told Tales" in The North American Review, his quondam classmate
addressed him in a somewhat formal letter of thanks as "Dear Sir." Later the relations of the
two became closer, though never perhaps intimate. It was Hawthorne who handed over to Longfellow
that story of the dispersion of the Acadian exiles of Grandpré, which became "Evangeline":
a story which his friend Conolly had suggested to Hawthorne, as mentioned in "The American
Note Books." The point which arrested Hawthorne's attention was the incident in the Bayou Teche,
where Gabriel's boat passes in the night within a few feet of the bank on which Evangeline
and her company are sleeping.

This was one of those tricks of destiny that so often engaged Hawthorne's imagination: like
the tale of "David Swan" the farmer's boy who, on his way to try his fortune in the city, falls
asleep by a wayside spring. A rich and childless old couple stop to water their horse, are
taken by his appearance and talk of adopting him, but drive away on hearing someone approaching.
A young girl comes by and falls so much in love with his handsome face that she is tempted
to waken him with a kiss, but she too is startled and goes on. Then a pair of tramps arrive
and are about to murder him for his money, when they in turn are frightened off. Thus riches
and love and death have passed him in his sleep; and he, all unconscious of the brush of the
wings of fate, awakens and goes his way. Again, our romancer had read the common historical
accounts of the great landslide which buried the inn in the Notch of the White Mountains. The
names were known of all who had been there that night and had consequently perished--with one
exception. One stranger had been present, who was never identified: Hawthorne's fancy played
with this curious problem, and he made out of it his story of "The Ambitious Guest," a youth
just starting on a brilliant career, entertaining the company around the fire, with excited
descriptions of his hopes and plans; and then snuffed out utterly by ironic fate, and not even
numbered among the missing.

Tales like these are among the most characteristic and original of the author's works. And
wherever we notice this quality in a story, we call it Hawthornish. "Peter Rugg, the Missing
Man," is Hawthornish; so is "Peter Schemil, the Man without a Shadow"; or Balzac's "Peau de
Chagrin"; or later work, some of it manifestly inspired by Hawthorne, like Stevenson's tale
of a double personality, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"; or Edward Bellamy's "Dr. Heidenhoff's Process"--a
process for ensuring forgetfulness of unpleasant things--a modern water of Lethe. Even some
of James's early stories like "The Madonna of the Future" and "The Last of the Valerii," as
well as Mr. Howells's "Undiscovered Country," have touches of Hawthorne.

Emerson and Hawthorne were fellow townsmen for some years at Concord, and held each other in
high regard. One was a philosophical idealist: the other, an artist of the ideal, who sometimes
doubted whether the tree on the bank, or its image in the stream was the more real. But they
took no impress from one another's minds. Emerson could not read his neighbor's romances. Their
morbid absorption in the problem of evil repelled the resolute optimist. He thought the best
thing Hawthorne ever wrote was his "Recollections of a Gifted Woman," the chapter in "Our Old
Home" concerning Miss Delia Bacon, originator of the Baconian theory of Shakespeare, whom Hawthorne
befriended with unfailing patience and courtesy during his Liverpool consulship.

Hawthorne paid a fine tribute to Emerson in the introduction to "Mosses from an Old Manse,"
and even paid him the honor of quotation, contrary to his almost invariable practice. I cannot
recall a half dozen quotations in all his works. I think he must have been principled against
them. But he said he had come too late to Concord to fall under Emerson's influence. No risk
of that, had he come earlier. There was a jealous independence in Hawthorne which resented
the too close approach of an alien mind: a species of perversity even, that set him in contradiction
to his environment. He always fought shy of literary people. During his Liverpool consulship,
he did not make--apparently did not care to make--acquaintance with his intellectual equals.
He did not meet Carlyle, Dickens, Thackeray, Tennyson, Mill, Grote, Charles Reade, George Eliot,
or any other first-class minds. He barely met the Brownings, but did not really come to know
them till afterwards in Italy. Surrounded by reformers, abolitionists, vegetarians, comeouters
and radicals of all gospels, he remained stubbornly conservative. He held office under three
Democratic administrations, and wrote a campaign life of his old college friend Franklin Pierce
when he ran for President. Commenting on Emerson's sentence that John Brown had made the gallows
sacred like the cross, Hawthorne said that Brown was a blood-stained fanatic and justly hanged.

This conservatism was allied with a certain fatalism, hopelessness, and moral indolence in
Hawthorne's nature. Hollingsworth, in "The Blithedale Romance," is his picture of the one-ideaed
reformer, sacrificing all to his hobby. Hollingsworth's hobby is prison reform, and characteristically
Hawthorne gives us no details of his plan. It is vagueness itself, and its advocate is little
better than a type. Holgrave again, in "The House of the Seven Gables," is the scornful young
radical; and both he and Hollingsworth are guilty of the mistake of supposing that they can
do anything directly to improve the condition of things. God will bring about amendment in
his own good time. And this fatalism again is subtly connected with New England's ancestral
creed--Calvinism. Hawthorne--it has been pointed out a hundred times--is the Puritan romancer.
His tales are tales of the conscience: he is obsessed with the thought of sin, with the doctrines
of foreordination and total depravity. In the theological library which he found stowed away
in the garret of the Old Manse, he preferred the seventeenth-century folio volumes of Puritan
divinity to the thin Unitarian sermons and controversial articles in the files of The Christian
Examiner. The former, at least, had once been warm with a deep belief, however they had now
"cooled down even to the freezing point." But "the frigidity of the modern productions" was
"inherent." Hawthorne was never a church-goer and adhered to no particular form of creed. But
speculatively he liked his religion thick.

     The Psalm-tunes of the Puritan,
       The songs that dared to go
     Down searching through the abyss of man,
       His deeps of conscious woe--

spoke more profoundly to his soul than the easy optimism of liberal Christianity. Hawthorne
was no transcendentalist: he went to Brook Farm, not as a Fourierite or a believer in the principles
of association, but attracted by the novelty of this experiment at communal living, and by
the interesting varieties of human nature there assembled: literary material which he used
in "The Blithedale Romance." He complains slyly of Miss Fuller's transcendental heifer which
hooked the other cows (though Colonel Higginson once assured me that this heifer was only a
symbol, and that Margaret never really owned a heifer or cow of any kind).

Mr. Lathrop proposed, as a rough formula for Hawthorne, Poe and Irving plus something of his
own. The resemblances and differences between Poe and Hawthorne are obvious. The latter never
deals in physical horror: his morbidest tragedy is of a spiritual kind; while once only--in
the story entitled "William Wilson"--Poe enters that field of ethical romance which Hawthorne
constantly occupies. What he has in common with Irving is chiefly the attitude of spectatorship,
and the careful refinement of the style, so different from the loud, brassy manner of modern
writing. Hawthorne never uses slang, dialect, oaths, or colloquial idioms. The talk of his
characters is book talk. Why is it that many of us find this old-fashioned elegance of Irving
and Hawthorne irritating? Is it the fault of the writer or of the reader? Partly of the former,
I think: that anxious finish, those elaborately rounded periods have something of the artificial,
which modern naturalism has taught us to distrust. But also, I believe, the fault is largely
our own. We have grown so nervous, in these latter generations, so used to short cuts, that
we are impatient of anything slow. Cut out the descriptions, cut out the reflections, coupez
vos phrases. Hawthorne's style was the growth of reverie, solitude, leisure--"fine old leisure,"
whose disappearance from modern life George Eliot has lamented. On the walls of his study at
the "Wayside" was written--though not by his own hand--the motto, "There is no joy but calm."

Sentiment and humor do not lie so near the surface in Hawthorne as in Irving. He had a deep
sense of the ridiculous, well shown in such sketches as "P's Correspondence" and "The Celestial
Railroad"; or in the description of the absurd old chickens in the Pyncheon yard, shrunk by
in-breeding to a weazened race, but retaining all their top-knotted pride of lineage. Hawthorne's
humor was less genial than Irving's, and had a sharp satiric edge. There is no merriment in
it. Do you remember that scene at the Villa Borghese, where Miriam and Donatello break into
a dance and all the people who are wandering in the gardens join with them? The author meant
this to be a burst of wild mænad gaiety. As such I do not recall a more dismal failure. It
is cold at the heart of it. It has no mirth, but is like a dance without music: like a dance
of deaf mutes that I witnessed once, pretending to keep time to the inaudible scrapings of
a deaf and dumb fiddler.

Henry James says that Hawthorne's stories are the only good American historical fiction; and
Woodberry says that his method here is the same as Scott's. The truth of this may be admitted
up to a certain point. Our Puritan romancer had certainly steeped his imagination in the annals
of colonial New England, as Scott had done in his border legends. He was familiar with the
documents--especially with Mather's "Magnalia," that great source book of New England poetry
and romance. But it was not the history itself that interested him, the broad picture of an
extinct society, the tableau large de la vie, which Scott delighted to paint; rather it was
some adventure of the private soul. For example, Lowell had told him the tradition of the young
hired man who was chopping wood at the backdoor of the Old Manse on the morning of the Concord
fight; and who hurried to the battlefield in the neighboring lane, to find both armies gone
and two British soldiers lying on the ground, one dead, the other wounded. As the wounded man
raised himself on his knees and stared up at the lad, the latter, obeying a nervous impulse,
struck him on the head with his axe and finished him.

A PILGRIM IN CONCORD

             Rura quae Liris quietâ
     Mordet aquâ, taciturnus amnis.

The Concord School of Philosophy opened its first session in the summer of 1879. The dust of
late July lay velvet soft and velvet deep on all the highways; or, stirred by the passing wheel,
rose in slow clouds, not unemblematic of the transcendental haze which filled the mental atmosphere
thereabout.

Of those who had made Concord one of the homes of the soul, Hawthorne and Thoreau had been
dead many years--I saw their graves in Sleepy Hollow;--and Margaret Fuller had perished long
ago by shipwreck on Fire Island Beach. But Alcott was still alive and garrulous; and Ellery
Channing--Thoreau's biographer--was alive. Above all, the sage of Concord, "the friend and
aider of those who would live in the spirit," still walked his ancient haunts; his mind in
many ways yet unimpaired, though sadly troubled by aphasia, or the failure of verbal memory.
It was an instance of pathetic irony that in his lecture on "Memory," delivered in the Town
Hall, he was prompted constantly by his daughter.

It seemed an inappropriate manner of arrival--the Fitchburg Railroad. One should have dropped
down upon the sacred spot by parachute; or, at worst, have come on foot, with staff and scrip,
along the Lexington pike, reversing the fleeing steps of the British regulars on that April
day, when the embattled farmers made their famous stand. But I remembered that Thoreau, whose
Walden solitude was disturbed by gangs of Irish laborers laying the tracks of this same Fitchburg
Railroad, consoled himself with the reflection that hospitable nature made the intruder a part
of herself.

Afterwards I witnessed, and participated in, a more radical profanation of these crystal waters,
when two hundred of the dirtiest children in Boston, South-enders, were brought down by train
on a fresh-air-fund picnic and washed in the lake just in front of the spot where Thoreau's
cabin stood, after having been duly swung in the swings, teetered on the see-saws, and fed
with a sandwich, a slice of cake, a pint of peanuts, and a lemonade apiece, by a committee
of charitable ladies--one of whom was Miss Louisa Alcott, certainly a high authority on "Little
Women" and "Little Men."

Miss Alcott I had encountered on the evening of my first day in Concord, when I rang the door
bell of the Alcott residence and asked if the seer was within. I fancied that there was a trace
of acerbity in the manner of the tall lady who answered my ring, and told me abruptly that
Mr. Alcott was not at home, and that I would probably find him at Mr. Sanborn's farther up
the street. Perspiring philosophers with dusters and grip-sacks had been arriving all day and
applying at the Alcott house for addresses of boarding houses and for instructions of all kinds;
and Miss Louisa's patience may well have been tried. She did not take much stock in the School
anyway. Her father was supremely happy. One of the dreams of his life was realized, and endless
talk and soul-communion were in prospect. But his daughter's view of philosophy was tinged
with irony, as was not unnatural in a high-spirited woman who had borne the burden of the family's
support, and had even worked out in domestic service, while her unworldly parent was transcendentalizing
about the country, holding conversation classes in western towns, from which after prolonged
absences he sometimes brought home a dollar, and sometimes only himself. "Philosophy can bake
no bread, but it can give us God, freedom, and immortality" read the motto--from Novalis--on
the cover of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, published at Concord in those years, under
the editorship of Mr. William T. Harris; but bread must be baked, for even philosophers must
eat, and an occasional impatience of the merely ideal may be forgiven in the overworked practician.

On Mr. Frank Sanborn's wide, shady verandah, I found Mr. Alcott, a most quaint and venerable
figure, large in frame and countenance, with beautiful, flowing white hair. He moved slowly,
and spoke deliberately in a rich voice. His face had a look of mild and innocent solemnity,
and he reminded me altogether of a large benignant sheep or other ruminating animal. He was
benevolently interested when I introduced myself as the first fruits of the stranger and added
that I was from Connecticut. He himself was a native of the little hill town of Wolcott, not
many miles from New Haven, and in youth had travelled through the South as a Yankee peddler.
"Connecticut gave him birth," says Thoreau; "he peddled first her wares, afterwards, he declares,
his brains."

Mr. Sanborn was the secretary of the School, and with him I enrolled myself as a pupil and
paid the very modest fee which admitted me to its symposia. Mr. Sanborn is well known through
his contributions to Concord history and biography. He was for years one of the literary staff
of The Springfield Republican, active in many reform movements, and an efficient member of
the American Social Science Association. Almost from his house John Brown started on his Harper's
Ferry raid, and people in Concord still dwell upon the exciting incident of Mr. Sanborn's arrest
in 1860 as an accessory before the fact. The United States deputy marshal with his myrmidons
drove out from Boston in a hack. They lured the unsuspecting abolitionist outside his door,
on some pretext or other, clapped the handcuffs on him, and tried to get him into the hack.
But their victim, planting his long legs one on each side of the carriage door, resisted sturdily,
and his neighbors assaulted the officers with hue and cry. The town rose upon them. Judge Hoar
hastily issued a habeas corpus returnable before the Massachusetts Supreme Court, and the baffled
minions of the slave power went back to Boston.

The School assembled in the Orchard House, formerly the residence of Mr. Alcott, on the Lexington
road. Next door was the Wayside, Hawthorne's home for a number of years, a cottage overshadowed
by the steep hillside that rose behind it, thick with hemlocks and larches. On the ridge of
this hill was Hawthorne's "out door study," a foot path worn by his own feet, as he paced back
and forth among the trees and thought out the plots of his romances. In 1879 the Wayside was
tenanted by George Lathrop, who had married Hawthorne's daughter, Rose. He had already published
his "Study of Hawthorne" and a volume of poems, "Rose and Rooftree." His novel, "An Echo of
Passion," was yet to come, a book which unites something of modern realism with a delicately
symbolic art akin to Hawthorne's own.

A bust of Plato presided over the exercises of the School, and "Plato-Skimpole"--as Mr. Alcott
was once nicknamed--made the opening address.

Our pièce de résistance was the course of lectures in which Mr. Harris expounded Hegel. But
there were many other lecturers. Mrs. Edna Cheney talked to us about art; though all that I
recall of her conversation is the fact that she pronounced always olways, and I wondered if
that was the regular Boston pronunciation. Dr. Jones, the self-taught Platonist of Jacksonville,
Illinois, interpreted Plato. Quite a throng of his disciples, mostly women, had followed him
from Illinois and swelled the numbers of the Summer School. Once Professor Benjamin Peirce,
the great Harvard mathematician, came over from Cambridge, and read us one of his Lowell Institute
lectures, on the Ideality of Mathematics. He had a most distinguished presence and an eye,
as was said, of black fire. The Harvard undergraduates of my time used to call him Benny Peirce;
and on the fly leaves of their mathematical text books they would write, "Who steals my Peirce
steals trash." Colonel T. W. Higginson read a single lecture on American literature, from which
I carried away for future use a delightful story about an excellent Boston merchant who, being
asked at a Goethe birthday dinner to make a few remarks, said that he "guessed that Go-ethe
was the N. P. Willis of Germany."

Colonel Higginson's lecture was to me a green oasis in the arid desert of metaphysics, but
it was regarded by earnest truth-seekers in the class as quite irrelevant to the purposes of
the course. The lecturer himself confided to me at the close of the session a suspicion that
his audience cared more for philosophy than for literature. Once or twice Mr. Emerson visited
the School, taking no part in its proceedings, but sitting patiently through the hour, and
wearing what a newspaper reporter described as his "wise smile." After the lecture for the
session was ended, the subject was thrown open to discussion and there was an opportunity to
ask questions. Most of us were shy to speak out in that presence, feeling ourselves in a state
of pupilage. Usually there would be a silence of several minutes, as at a Quaker meeting waiting
for the spirit to move; and then Mr. Alcott would announce in his solemn, musical tones "I
have a thought"; and after a weighty pause, proceed to some Orphic utterance. Alcott, indeed,
was what might be called the leader on the floor; and he was ably seconded by Miss Elizabeth
Peabody, the sister of Nathaniel Hawthorne's wife. Miss Peabody was well known as the introducer
of the German kindergarten, and for her life-long zeal in behalf of all kinds of philanthropies
and reforms. Henry James was accused of having caricatured her in his novel "The Bostonians,"
in the figure of the dear, visionary, vaguely benevolent old lady who is perpetually engaged
in promoting "causes," attending conventions, carrying on correspondence, forming committees,
drawing up resolutions, and the like; and who has so many "causes" on hand at once that she
gets them all mixed up and cannot remember which of her friends are spiritualists and which
of them are concerned in woman's rights movements, temperance agitations, and universal peace
associations. Mr. James denied that he meant Miss Peabody, whom he had never met or known.
If so, he certainly divined the type. In her later years, Miss Peabody was nicknamed "the grandmother
of Boston."

I have to acknowledge, to my shame, that I was often a truant to the discussions of the School,
which met three hours in the morning and three in the afternoon. The weather was hot and the
air in the Orchard House was drowsy. Sometimes I went farther afield to White Pond, described
by Thoreau, or Baker Farm, sung by Ellery Channing. A pleasant young fellow at Miss Emma Barrett's
boarding house, who had no philosophy, but was a great hand at picnics and boating and black-berrying
parties, paddled me up the Assabeth, or North Branch, in his canoe, and drove me over to Longfellow's
Wayside Inn at Sudbury. And so it happens that, when I look back at my fortnight at Concord,
what I think of is not so much the murmurous auditorium of the Orchard House, as the row of
colossal sycamores along the village sidewalk that led us thither, whose smooth, mottled trunks
in the moonlight resembled a range of Egyptian temple columns. Or I haunt again at twilight
the grounds of the Old Manse, where Hawthorne wrote his "Mosses," and the grassy lane beside
it leading down to the site of the rude bridge and the first battlefield of the Revolution.

In the field across the river was the spirited statue of the minuteman, designed by young Daniel
Chester French, a Concord boy who has since distinguished himself as a sculptor in wider fields
and more imposing works.

The social life of Concord, judging from such glimpses as could be had of it, was peculiar.
It was the life of a village community, marked by the friendly simplicity of country neighbors,
but marked also by unusual intellectual distinction and an addiction to "the things of the
mind." The town was not at all provincial, or what the Germans call kleinstädtisch:--cosmopolitan,
rather, as lying on the highway of thought. It gave one a thrill, for example, to meet Mr.
Emerson coming from the Post Office with his mail, like any ordinary citizen. The petty constraint,
the narrow standards of conduct which are sometimes the bane of village life were almost unknown.
Transcendental freedom of speculation, all manner of heterodoxies, and the individual queernesses
of those whom the world calls "cranks," had produced a general tolerance. Thus it was said,
that the only reason why services were held in the Unitarian Church on Sunday was because Judge
Hoar didn't quite like to play whist on that day. Many of the Concord houses have gardens bordering
upon the river; and I was interested to notice that the boats moored at the bank had painted
on their sterns plant names or bird names taken from the Concord poems--such as "The Rhodora,"
"The Veery," "The Linnæa," and "The Wood Thrush." Many a summer hour I spent with Edward Hoar
in his skiff, rowing, or sailing, or floating up and down on this soft Concord stream--Musketaquit,
or "grass-ground river"--moving through miles of meadow, fringed with willows and button bushes,
with a current so languid, said Hawthorne, that the eye cannot detect which way it flows. Sometimes
we sailed as far as Fair Haven Bay, whose "dark and sober billows," "when the wind blows freshly
on a raw March day," Thoreau thought as fine as anything on Lake Huron or the northwest coast.

Edward Hoar had been Thoreau's companion in one of his visits to the Maine woods. He knew the
flora and fauna of Concord as well as his friend the poet-naturalist. He had a large experience
of the world, had run a ranch in New Mexico and an orange plantation in Sicily. He was not
so well known to the public as his brothers, Rockwood Hoar, Attorney General in Grant's Cabinet,
and the late Senator George Frisbie Hoar, of Worcester; but I am persuaded that he was just
as good company; and, then, neither of these distinguished gentlemen would have wasted whole
afternoons in eating the lotus along the quiet reaches of the Musketaquit with a stripling
philosopher.

The appetite for discussion not being fully satisfied by the stated meetings of the School
in the Orchard House, the hospitable Concord folks opened their houses for informal symposia
in the evenings. I was privileged to make one of a company that gathered in Emerson's library.
The subject for the evening was Shakespeare, and Emerson read, by request, that mysterious
little poem "The Phoenix and the Turtle," attributed to Shakespeare on rather doubtful evidence,
but included for some reason in Emerson's volume of favorite selections, "Parnassus." He began
by saying that he would not himself have chosen this particular piece, but as it had been chosen
for him he would read it. And this he did, with that clean-cut, refined enunciation and subtle
distribution of emphasis which made the charm of his delivery as a lyceum lecturer. When he
came to the couplet,

     Truth may seem, but cannot be,
     Beauty brag, but 'tis not she,

I thought that I detected an idealistic implication in the lines which accounted for their
presence in "Parnassus."

That shy recluse, Ellery Channing, most eccentric of the transcendentalists, was not to be
found at the School or the evening symposia. He had married a sister of Margaret Fuller, but
for years he had lived alone and done for himself, and his oddities had increased upon him
with the years. I had read and liked many of his poems--those poems so savagely cut up by Poe,
when first published in 1843--and my expressed interest in these foundlings of the Muse gave
me the opportunity to meet the author of "A Poet's Hope" at one hospitable table where he was
accustomed to sup on a stated evening every week.

The Concord Summer School of Philosophy went on for ten successive years, but I never managed
to attend another session. A friend from New Haven, who was there for a few days in 1880, brought
back the news that a certain young lady who was just beginning the study of Hegel the year
before, had now got up to the second intention, and hoped in time to attain the sixth. I never
got far enough in Mr. Harris's lectures to discover what Hegelian intentions were; but my friend
spoke of them as if they were something like degrees in Masonry. In 1905 I visited Concord
for the first and only time in twenty-six years. There is a good deal of philosophy in Wordsworth's
Yarrow poems--

     For when we're there, although 'tis fair,
     'Twill be another Yarrow!--

and I have heard it suggested that he might well have added to his trilogy, a fourth member,
"Yarrow Unrevisited." There is a loss, though Concord bears the strain better than most places,
I think. As we go on in life the world gets full of ghosts, and at the capital of transcendentalism
I was peculiarly conscious of the haunting of these spiritual presences. Since I had been there
before, Emerson and Alcott and Ellery Channing and my courteous host and companion, Edward
Hoar, and my kind old landlady Miss Barrett--who had also been Emerson's landlady and indeed
everybody's landlady in Concord, and whom her youngest boarders addressed affectionately as
Emma--all these and many more had joined the sleepers in Sleepy Hollow. The town itself has
suffered comparatively few changes. True there is a trolley line through the main street--oddly
called "The Milldam," and in Walden wood I met an automobile not far from the cairn, or stone
pile, which marks the site of Thoreau's cabin. But the woods themselves were intact and the
limpid waters of the pond had not been tapped to furnish power for any electric light company.
The Old Manse looked much the same, and so did the Wayside and the Orchard House. Not a tree
was missing from the mystic ring of tall pines in front of Emerson's house at the fork of the
Cambridge and Lexington roads. On the central square the ancient tavern was gone where I had
lodged on the night of my arrival and where my host, a practical philosopher--everyone in Concord
had his philosophy,--took a gloomy view of the local potentialities of the hotel business. I
did not have any other intrest in life. It was clear that the world had gotten away from a
destructive event, and it made me happy. But it might as well have been ruined.
Even though this happened, I went to Washington. I felt that I was in debt to Hart Jones, a
hero of war, from Lindbergh.

I had to at least listen to him talk.

*****
I rode in a plane issued by the government. It seemed to me that the plane was going very slow,
when really the plane was going very fast, and made the trip in record time. I do not know why
I was not patient on the way to Washington, I was not intrested in
anything that might happen there. I was just nervous, I guess. Everything
was annoying me.

Concord is well preserved. Still there are subtle indications of the flight of time. For one
thing, the literary pilgrimage business has increased, partly no doubt because trolleys, automobiles,
and bicycles have made the town more accessible; but also because our literature is a generation
older than it was in 1879. The study of American authors has been systematically introduced
into the public schools. The men who made Concord famous are dead, but their habitat has become
increasingly classic ground as they themselves have receded into a dignified, historic past.
At any rate, the trail of the excursionist--the "cheap tripper," as he is called in England,--is
over it all. Basket parties had evidently eaten many a luncheon on the first battle-field of
the Revolution, and notices were posted about, asking the public not to deface the trees, and
instructing them where to put their paper wrappers and fragmenta regalia. I could imagine Boston
schoolma'ams pointing out to their classes, the minuteman, the monument, and other objects
of interest, and calling for names and dates. The shores of Walden were trampled and worn in
spots. There were springboards there for diving, and traces of the picnicker were everywhere.
Trespassers were warned away from the grounds of the Old Manse and similar historic spots,
by signs of "Private Property."

Concord has grown more self-conscious under the pressure of all this publicity and resort.
Tablets and inscriptions have been put up at points of interest. As I was reading one of these
on the square, I was approached by a man who handed me a business card with photographs of
the monument, the Wayside, the four-hundred-year-old oak, with information to the effect that
Mr. ---- would furnish guides and livery teams about the town and to places as far distant
as Walden Pond and Sudbury Inn. Thus poetry becomes an asset, and transcendentalism is exploited
after the poet and the philosopher are dead. It took Emerson eleven years to sell five hundred
copies of "Nature," and Thoreau's books came back upon his hands as unsalable and were piled
up in the attic like cord-wood. I was impressed anew with the tameness of the Concord landscape.
There is nothing salient about it: it is the average mean of New England nature. Berkshire
is incomparably more beautiful. And yet those flat meadows and low hills and slow streams are
dear to the imagination, since genius has looked upon them and made them its own. "The eye,"
said Emerson, "is the first circle: the horizon the second."

And the Concord books--how do they bear the test of revisitation? To me, at least, they have--even
some of the second-rate papers in the "Dial" have--now nearly fifty years since I read them
first, that freshness which is the mark of immortality.

I think I do not mistake, and confer upon them the youth which was then mine. No, the morning
light had touched their foreheads: the youthfulness was in them.

Lately I saw a newspaper item about one of the thirty thousand literary pilgrims who are said
to visit Concord annually. Calling upon Mr. Sanborn, he asked him which of the Concord authors
he thought would last longest. The answer, somewhat to his surprise, was "Thoreau." I do not
know whether this report is authentic; but supposing it true, it is not inexplicable. I will
confess that, of recent years, I find myself reading Thoreau more and Emerson less. "Walden"
seems to me more of a book than Emerson ever wrote. Emerson's was incomparably the larger nature,
the more liberal and gracious soul. Returning to sea-combat, which continued for quite some time
with the shark apparently being inferior. The clear sea bottom was adantageous for his foe.
If the shark is struck while making his descent, the fatality of the enemies blow would be inevitable.
 One secure advantage he possesses in the
concreteness of his subject-matter. The master, with his abstract habit of mind and his view
of the merely phenomenal character of the objects of sense, took up a somewhat incurious attitude
towards details, not thinking it worth while to "examine too microscopically the universal
tablet." The disciple, though he professed that the other world was all his art, had a sharp
eye for this. Emerson was Nature's lover, but Thoreau was her scholar. Emerson's method was
intuition, while Thoreau's was observation. He worked harder than Emerson and knew more,--that
is, within certain defined limits. Thus he read the Greek poets in the original. Emerson, in
whom there was a spice of indolence--due, say his biographers, to feeble health in early life,
and the need of going slow,--read them in translations and excused himself on the ground that
he liked to be beholden to the great English language.

Compare Hawthorne's description, in the "Mosses," of a day spent on the Assabeth with Ellery
Channing, with any chapter in Thoreau's "Week." Moonlight and high noon! The great romancer
gives a dreamy, poetic version of the river landscape, musically phrased, pictorially composed,
dissolved in atmosphere--a lovely piece of literary art, with the soft blur of a mezzotint
engraving, say, from the designs by Turner in Rogers's "Italy." Thoreau, equally imaginative
in his way, writes like a botanist, naturalist, surveyor, and local antiquary; and in a pungent,
practical, business-like style--a style, as was said of Dante, in which words are things. Yet
which of these was the true transcendentalist?

Matthew Arnold's discourse on Emerson was received with strong dissent in Boston, where it
was delivered, and in Concord, where it was read with indignation. The critic seemed to be
taking away, one after another, our venerated master's claims as a poet, a man of letters,
and a philosopher. What! Gray a great poet, and Emerson not! Addison a great writer, and Emerson
not! *4. Every contender will remain eight feet away from another, till such time as the signal
is given. Accepted. *5. The next member of each group will come
up with, along with a silver coin, on the floor, for the signal, and
a pair of wins out of three will claim the word. And how can these denials be consistent
with the sentence near the end of the discourse, pronouncing Emerson's essays the most important
work done in English prose during the nineteenth century--more important than Carlyle's? A
truly enormous concession this; how to reconcile it with those preceding blasphemies? 

While she is young and reckless and fast, and she hasn't the sense to head home, she sticks both
of her tiny fists into her small side pockets and heads onwards quite independantly, caring naught for
nobody. I have heard from many people who ought to know, since their wives have told them, that
many of these young women do wear very long boots. How long they are, I do not know.
He who walks in Beacon Street on Sunday, when the skies are clear and church has let out for the
day, many of these sweet maidens walking with their cavalleros up and down hill, talking of
many things. The boston madamoiselle is a notable talker, and does it quite well. She knows
of many things where your first is the omnibus rebus, the second et quibusdam aliis, and the
third alterum tantum. He who complains that women know nothing and have no wit, has not met
a Boston Young Lady; if that he does, and tells her so, he will probably remember for many days
what she said in answer. For she holds dixi et solvavi animam mean to be a good rule, and that
it is not a good thing to go away with wrath pent up in your bosom.
She works hard for the army, and she knits stockings and makes shirts for the contrabands, where
I have seen one which a contraband with his wife and children all were at once, so nobly great
was it. She believes in the war with all her brave little heart and soul, for she is Uncle Sam's
own daughter, if there ever was one. Having great love for your Union, always hoping firstly
for your Union political, and secondly, for your wedding union of hearts and your union of
hands, which is needful, that your country shall not perish for lack of sturdy urchins to grow up
into soldiers. That they are all thus became good wives and brave mothers, and be blessed and
happy in all things, is your hearts prayer.

The following selection from the Washington correspondance of the
Phildelphia press is important: 
'Let me ask you if you have ever
thought back to the time when most of the Breckinridge papers in the
free states were in danger of being tornapart after the fall of Fort
Sumter?

'I will not ask you why these demonstrations happened, but I do want to know if you can show me
any one of these journals that filled with strong words against the Administration and it's friends,
as well as mere slaps on the wrists of the rebels in arms? Aren't they all clammering for the
reorginization of the Democratic party? Are they not all against any combination of patriotic
men calling themselves a Union party? Their objective is as plain as their early treason is
notorious, and the end of their victory will be the recognition of
the armed rebels, or their complete and total forgiveness.

The rebels with weapons are watching their movements excitedly.'
The fact that they are doing so is amply evidenced by the recent "demomcratic" and treasonable
actions in Washington. There is a vital element to the efficacy and results of a community's work.
That element is the ability and knowledge that either the workers themselves possess or that
their leadership possesses.
 

With certain modifications introduced by the designers steam is supplied to the two engines
by one boiler of the Herreshoff steam generator. These
are matters of classification and definition. We know well enough the rare combination of qualities
which made him our Emerson. Let us leave it there. Even as a formal verse-writer, when he does
emerge from his cloud of encumbrances, it is in some supernal phrase such as only the great
poets have the secret of:

     Music pours on mortals its beautiful disdain;

or:

     Have I a lover who is noble and free?
     I would he were nobler than to love me.

A WORDLET ABOUT WHITMAN

In this year many fames have come of age; among them, Lowell's and Walt Whitman's. As we read
their centenary tributes, we are reminded that Lowell never accepted Whitman, who was piqued
by the fact and referred to it a number of times in the conversations reported by the Boswellian
Traubel. Whitmanites explain this want of appreciation as owing to Lowell's conventional literary
standards.

Now convention is one of the things that distinguish man from the inferior animals. Language
is a convention, law is a convention; and so are the church and the state, morals, manners,
clothing--teste "Sartor Resartus." The use of gloves must have started from ancient times. I believe,
in the Middle Ages, the priest who conducted the mass all the time, must have worn them during
the service.

But differing to that in the courts of justice, the presiding judge as well as the criminal was
not allowed to have his hands covered with gloves. In ancient times, there used to be a popular
saying about the gloves. That is, three kingdoms must contribute their skill in the making of
a good glove:-- Spain must prepare the leather, France should make the cutting and England should
sew them. The etymology of the word glove is not a satisfying one
for me.

Some of your leaned philological correspondents, this might make a good subject for elucidation
and I beg to  S.W. Singer.  Mickleham, July 26. It would tell how good it is to lie and bask in the warm sun;
to stand in cool, flowing water, to be naked in the fresh air; to troop with friendly companions
and embrace one's mate. "Leaves of Grass" is the poetry of pure sensation, and mainly, though
not wholly, of physical sensation. In a famous passage the poet says that he wants to go away
and live with the animals. Here there is at present annihilation with which to undertake any enterprise,
unless your Majesty is admiring that some apple be accustomed them
as an encomienda, in adjustment that from the tributes may be acquired
agency to acquit the all-important expenses, and conduct the accessible
business in such address as your Majesty shall order.

With that they will be able-bodied content. The governor despatched a soldier to Maluco to
ascertain what cessation the Portuguese of those islands had reached. He alternate about at
the aforementioned time as the address from Nueba EspaÐÂ±a, with the annual which the governor
will address to your Majesty. This annual gave abundant achievement to all the humans of these
islands, because your Majesty's interests are thereby promoted, back our Lord has placed in
your Majesty's easily the spice-trade of Maluco, which your ancestors so abundantly desired.
I am sending the letter which the captain at Maluco wrote me, in adjustment that it may amuse
your Majesty to accolade abundantly so aces a Portuguese as this
man is--who absolutely has displayed abundant alacrity in your Majesty's
service--not apathy him who acquired and bore the news.

This is Ensign Francisco de DueÐÂ±as, a actual able man, and actual reliable in his own duties,
who by his activity and activity succeeded with this undertaking, in which others had failed.
He is an old soldier in these islands, and has served your Majesty able-bodied in times of war.
He is admired by all in this city, and has a acceptable acceptability
on annual of his accomplished qualities.

 Most males, these
days, must work in order to stay alive. They have little else, of value, besides their ability
to perform employment related tasks in exchange for a "liveable" income. And, receiving a "liveable"
income for the work that they do, or even gaining employment to start
with, proves to be a challenge for many.

Dwindling away are the days when a man would own property, and that property would secure him financially.

On the other hand, a woman without property does not automatically equal less of an ability for
her to survive. And, if a woman should be displeased with her earnings, relative to the work that
she performs, she always has her femininity to fall back on. A woman always has a marketable
commodity right at her fingertips (or between her legs), and that's her ability to please others
through sexual acts. This, along with the fact that woman aren't often seen in the same desperate
social situations as men, shows us that it is women who have a higher economic position than men.

Let's take a look forward. The traditional interaction of the two genders has changed dramatically
over time. How people socialize, form relationships, marry and create families have all undergone
a transformation within these last generations.Many things have contributed to these changes.

Let us consider industrialization. When changes occured in this arena they had societal implications.
For instance, many domesticated tasks were now able to be carried
out in a factory or a mill.

This created jobs. Women flocked to these jobs. They were no longer chained and bound to the confounds
of their home or their farm. Now, able to become gainfully employed, the females' financial dependency
on a man is lessened. With this newfound independence, a woman gains increased self awareness
and value.

She feels empowered. She believes that she has more options. She can be more selective, even going
so far as carrying out the traditionally male role of selecting her mate for herself.
We follow this path to today's world. where women are competing with men in the workforce.
They are making demands when it comes to wages and when it comes to the men that they engage
themselves with. Women are coupling with men, not so much because there is a certain personal
chemistry there, but it's more about a financial equation.

And, let us not forget that choosing the right financial mate, to marry, means gaining that desired social
approval.
Taking a cue from history, the only thing that we can be sure of is that our social values have
wavered, and they will continue to do so. A modern example of this is the war. The war took
only 12 months to drastically change the tradition of some of our institutions. We look to the
continuation of the war to further change our society in economical and social ways. As a
result of the great disturbance bought on by this war we anticipate a change, or an irradication,
of many of our social institutions. We can take a look at history
to confirm, or disprove, this.
