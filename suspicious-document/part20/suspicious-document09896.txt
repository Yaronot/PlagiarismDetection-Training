Upon a broad, flat, rocky ledge, near a small, landlocked narrow inlet of one of the clustering
Twelve League Keys on the south side of Cuba, stood a red-tiled stone building, with a spacious
veranda in front, covered by plaited matting and canvas curtains triced up all around. The
back and one side of the building rested against a craggy eminence which overlooked the sea
on both sides of the island, and commanded a wide sweep of reef and blue water beyond. A few
clumps of cocoa-nut-trees and dwarf palms, with bare gaunt stems and tufted tops, stood out
here and there along the rocky slopes, while lesser vegetation of cactus and mangrove bushes
were scattered thickly over the island, cropping out with jagged edges of rock down to the
sandy beaches of the sea-shore. A deep narrow inlet of blue water lay pure and still near the
base of the rocky height, where, too, was a shelving curve of white sand, sprinkled about by
a few mat sheds, while on the other side the rocks arose to an elevation of a hundred and fifty
feet, forming a precipitous wall to the water. The inlet here took a sharp turn, scooped out
in a secluded basin, and then narrowing to less than forty yards in width, it wound and twisted
for a good mile in a thin blue channel to the open sea. Half that distance farther out was
a roaring ledge of white breakers, where the long swell came hammering on it, bursting up in
the air in brightish green masses, and then tumbling over the reef and bubbling smoothly on
toward the shore. On a level with the water no channel could be discerned through the ledge;
but, looking down from the heights around the inlet, a narrow blue gateway was marked out,
skirted on the surface by frothy crests of dead foam, and near where flocks of cormorants and
gulls were riding placidly on the inner side of the ledge. The island itself was about two
miles broad and seven long; and about midway of its width the inlet formed a forked strait,
one branch finding its way to the north, between a low succession of sandy hummocks, where
the water was too shallow to float a duck, and the other finding an outlet, scarcely a biscuit-toss
wide, between two bluff rocks. With the trade wind this passage was safe and accessible; but
on the change of the moon, with a breeze and swell from the south, the sea came bowling in,
in boiling eddies and whirlpools, and it required a nerve of iron to attempt an entrance. Just
within this narrow mouth, on a flat beveled ledge of rock but a few feet above the water, was
a small battery of two long eighteen-pounders, and two twenty-four pounder carronades mounted
on slides and trucks, with platforms laid on a bed of sand. Near by, beneath a low shed of
tiles and loose stones, were a pile of round shot, nicely blacked, and some stands of grape
and canister in canvas bags and cases, together with a large copper magazine of cartridges.
Seated a little way off on a low stool was a dingy Spaniard with a telescope laid across his
knees, which every little while he would raise to his eye and take a steady glance around the
horizon to seaward. At other times he would roll and light a paper cigar, murmuring some low
ditty to himself as he sent the smoke in volumes through his nose. A small brass bell hung
beside the shed near the battery, together with a telegraphic card, which was connected by
a wire strung on low posts, or hooked from rock to rock to the stone building away up at the
basin. To return, however, to the building: the veranda rested on square rough masonry full
twenty feet from the ground, which was loopholed for musketry, and with but one narrow slip
of a doorway that fell like a portcullis, banded and strapped with bars and studs of wrought
iron. Within this stone inclosure was a large and roomy vault, half filled with cases, barrels,
and packages, and at the upper angle was a narrow subterranean vaulted passage, barred also
by an iron-bound door, which led to a succession of whitewashed chambers--dark, damp, and gloomy--and
then on, in a fissure-like pathway, to another equally strongly secured outlet on the other
side of the crag. Leading to the veranda was a tautly-stretched rope ladder lashed to eye-bolts
let into the natural rock below, and hooked on to the edge of the floor above. This was the
only approach to the main floor of the building from the outside, though within were heavy
trap-doors like the hatches of a ship, which communicated to the chambers beneath. The whole
structure was of stone and tiles, roughly built, but yet strong and durable, and capable of
resisting any assault, unaided by cannon, that could be brought against it. The floor was divided
into four rooms, the smallest used for a kitchen, the next for a magazine of small arms, and
the third a spacious bedchamber, which opened into a large square apartment facing the veranda,
and which deserves more notice.

The lofty ceiling came down with the slant, showing the bare red tiles and heavy square beams
which supported the roof. In one of the stoutest of these beams was an eye-bolt and copper-strapped
block, through which was rove a long green silk rope, with one end secured by a cleat on the
wall, and the other dangling loose, and squirming, whenever a current of air struck it, like
a long, slim snake. Around the sides of the room, which were paneled with cedar, stood four
or five quaint ebony armoires, and as many cabinets, clocks, and bookcases, with here and there
a woman's work-stand, some of them curiously inlaid with pearl and silver. The walls were hung
with a great number of pictures of all kinds of vessels--generally, however, of the merchant
description--under full sail, with vivid light-houses in the distance, and combing breakers
under the lee; and all portraying gallant crews and buoyant freights, which probably had never
reached their destinations. Among this gallery of marine display was a broad framing of the
"Flags of All Nations;" and codes of signals, too, in bright colors, hung beside them. Farther
on, in a pretty panel by itself, surrounded by an edging of mother-o'-pearl, was a triple row
of female miniatures, a number of them of great beauty, and many executed in excellent taste
and art. In one corner was a large chart-stand, covered with rolls of maps and nautical instruments,
while above were suspended, by white rope grummets, a pyramidal line of spy-glasses and telescopes
of all sizes and make. Near the centre of the apartment stood a large round dining-table, on
which was laid things for a breakfast, a box of cigars, and a small silver pan of live coals.
There were but two windows to this room, both hung with striped muslin curtains, the casements
going to the floor, and looking out upon the veranda; and but two doors, one leading to the
kitchen, and the other to the sleeping-chamber on the opposite side.

Presently this last door opened, and, pushing aside a blue gauze curtain which hung before
it, an individual of about eight-and-twenty years of age stepped languidly into the room. He
was a tallish man, over six feet in stature, rather spare in build, but with great breadth
of shoulders, and though pale, apparently from long illness, yet he was evidently very active
and muscular when his nerves were called into action. Had it not been for a downward choleric
curve to his large nose, and a little parting at the corners of his wide mouth and compressed
lips, the face might have been thought handsome. The eyes were light blue, set close together,
but hard and stony, with no ray of mercy or humanity in them. He wore no beard, and his light
brown hair was thin and dry, and carefully parted at the side. He was dressed in a snow-white
pair of loose drilling trowsers, cut sailor fashion, straw slippers, and silk stockings; and
above he wore a brown linen jacket with large pearl buttons, and pockets. As he entered the
room he held a delicate cambric handkerchief, with a fine lace border, in his hands, which
he seemed to regard with curious interest as he lounged toward the windows of the veranda.

"I wish I could remember," he muttered musingly to himself, "which of those sisters this bit
of cambric belonged to, marked with an E.--Ellen or Eliza--hum! They would die--silly things!--tried
to stab me! Ho! what fun! Never left me even a miniature, either, for my collection. 'Bueno!'
There's more fish in the sea--and under it too!" he concluded, with an unpleasant elevation
of his eyebrows.

By this time he had approached the open window, and, shoving the delicate fabric daintily in
his pocket, he gave a slight yawn and looked out. Before him lay the deep blue basin of the
inlet, with a couple of boats hauled up on the shore; a few idle sailors moving about, or squatted
beneath the sheds playing cards or sewing. Without letting his eye rest more than a moment
on this scene, he turned and gave a long, earnest gaze between an opening of the rocks to seaward.
Then, with an angry frown, he approached the table, poured out a cup of black coffee, threw
rather than dropped in a lump of sugar, and sat himself down for his morning's meal. He had
scarcely, however, gulped down his cup of coffee and choked after it a slice of toast, than
he pushed away the breakfast things, snapped his teeth together like a steel clasp, biting
a tooth-pick in twain by the effort; and then, tossing the pieces away, he dashed his hand
into the cigar-box, extracted one, touched it to the pan of coals, and began to smoke savagely.
At first the grateful smoke appeared to soothe his chafed spirit, for he threw himself lazily
into a large cane-bottomed settee, and, stretching out his legs, seemed to enjoy the tranquil
scene around him with uninterrupted pleasure. But soon a scowl darkened his face; he dropped
his cigar on the floor, and springing to his feet as if touched by a galvanic battery, he snatched
down a telescope from the wall, steadied it at the window-sash, and peered again long and anxiously
to windward. He saw nothing, however, save the long, glassy, unbroken undulations of a calm
tropical sea, rolling away off beyond the ledge under a burning sun; no sign of a breeze--not
even a cat's-paw; and only now and then the leap of a deep-sea fish sparkling for a moment
in the air, and some sluggish gulls and pelicans sailing and diving about the reef for their
prey. Shutting up the glass with a crash that made the joints ring, he strode to the settee,
where hung several knotted bell-ropes, and, seizing one, gave it a sharp jerk. Then putting
his ear to an aperture in the wall, where was a hollow cane tube like the mouth of a speaking-trumpet,
he listened attentively till a hoarse whisper uttered the word,

"Señor."

Putting his mouth to the tube, he said,

"Can you make out the 'Centipede' from the crag station?"

"Not sure, sir, this morning; but last evening, at sunset, I saw a sail which I took to be
her. The sea-breeze is just beginning to make, and if she's to windward of Punta Arenas she'll
soon heave in sight."

This colloquy was held in Spanish; and when the signal-man had ceased speaking, the interlocutor
lit another cigar mechanically, kicked a foot-stool out of his way like a foot-ball, and thus
communed with himself as he rapidly paced between the table and the veranda:

"Fourteen weeks ago yesterday since the schooner was off Matanzas; not a word of news to cheer
me through all that cursed fever; the spring trade done, and the track deserted by this time!"

Then pausing in his walk, he stopped at the chart-stand, and unrolling a map, he went on:

"Where, in the devil's name, could she possibly have gone to? She might have been to Cape Horn
and back before this. Miserable fool that I was to trust the craft with that thirsty, thick-headed
Gibbs! Diavolo! he may have been captured, and if he has, I hope his neck has been stretched
like a shred of jerked beef."

Even while he was talking a bell struck near the settee, and, putting his ear again to the
tube, the hoarse voice said,

"I can make her out now, señor. She's just caught the strong young breeze, and is, hull up,
coming along with the bonnet off her fore-sail and a reef in her main-sail! There's a felucca
to windward of her, which I take to be the 'Panchita!'"

"Ah ha!" laughed the individual in the room. "The 'Centipede' is safe, then; and I am to have
the pleasure, too, of a visit from the Tuerto, the mercenary old owl, with his account of sales
and his greed. But let me once catch him foul, and, my one-eyed friend, I'll treat you to such
a dance that you won't need shoes!"

Here he glanced with a meaning look at the silk rope swaying from the beam above his head,
and the laugh of satisfaction which followed was not one a timid man would care to hear in
a dark night; nor did it come from his heart, as any one might have discovered from the ferocious
gleam of inward passion which shot out in the cold sparkle of his eyes and flitted away over
his grating teeth.

Controlling his feelings, however, and stepping out on the veranda, he drew aside the curtains
and sung out to the men in the huts, "One of you fellows, tell the boatswain I want him."

The men started up, and a moment after a man in a blue jacket stood out from one of the sheds
and threw up his hand to his straw hat.

"Get together the people! Let run the cable at the Alligator's mouth, and have three or four
warps ready for the schooner when she passes the point! The 'Panchita' is coming too, so look
out, and have enough lines to tow both vessels in case the breeze fails. Tell Mr. Gibbs to
moor close under the other shore in the old berth, and to come to me when he's anchored! D'ye
hear?"

All this was said in a sharp tone of command, and by the alacrity with which the orders were
executed the men seemed to be accustomed to a master who knew how to rule them.

CHAPTER IX.

CAPTAIN AND MATE.

A couple of hours had passed since the occupant of the stone building had last spoken to his
subordinates down at the inlet, but the interval he devoted to a minute inspection of weapons
in the armory adjoining his bedroom. They were all in excellent order, of the best make, and
very neatly arranged in stands and cases around the room. When he emerged again, after locking
the door, he held an exquisite pair of small pistols inlaid with gold in his hand, which he
gently polished with his cambric handkerchief, and then slipped them into his trowsers pockets.
Then he held short dialogues with the voice at the signal-station, and, without looking out
of the window, he informed himself of what was doing outside, and what progress the vessels
made toward their haven. When, however, the schooner poked her slim, low black bows, with her
sails down, around the point, he gave one stealthy peep, or glare rather, at her. He took all
in at that glance, from the patches of sheet-lead nailed over the shot-holes in her side, to
the sawed-off stump of the fore-top-mast; and then he remarked the absence of the boat which
was carried amidships, and the few men moving about her deck. Ay! he took it all in with that
one comprehensive glance, and when he had done, he raised his fore finger quivering with anger,
and slowly and unconsciously passed it with an ominous gesture across his throat.

Soon was heard a sullen plunge as an anchor was let go, and the splashing of the warps upon
the water as the stern of the "Centipede" was being moored to the rocks, to make room for her
companion the felucca, now shortly expected.

"Mr. Gibbs is coming on shore, señor, and he seems to have a wooden leg," came through the
tube. "The doctor is coming with him, and there is a little boy in the boat."

"Ho!" muttered the man in the saloon, "where was that brat picked up?"

Nothing more was said. The tall man lit a cigar, threw himself into an easy attitude on the
settee, opened a richly-bound volume, and waited. Ten minutes may have gone by when the trampling
of feet was heard on the smooth rocks outside the building, and the voice of Mr. Gibbs exclaimed,

"Easy, will ye? Doctor! Don't ye see it tears the narves out of me to hobble with this broomstick-handle
of a leg! There! Stop a bit! How in thunder am I to climb this ladder? Oh!" Here a low howl
of pain. "Another shove. Easy, old Sawbones! So--give us another push, will ye? All right!
There, that'll do."

The next minute Mr. Bill Gibbs stood on the broad piazza, and, with the assistance of a crutch,
he hobbled to the entrance of the apartment, and only pausing to recover his wind and compose
his features, he pulled off his straw hat and entered.

"So ho! Mr. Gibbs," said the man on the settee, as the burly, lame ruffian darkened the entrance,
laying the book down as he spoke, and waving his delicate handkerchief before him.

"So ho! Mr. Gibbs, you've come back at last! Delighted to see you. I am, 'pon my soul. Ah!
one of those stout pins gone? Why, how's this? Some little accident? Santa Cruz rum and a tumble
down the hatchway, perhaps, eh? D'ye smoke? Take a cheroot. Put that bag on the table."

All this was said in a gay, gibing tone, with an indifference and sang froid that a tight-rope
dancer might have been proud of; and as he ended, he threw a handful of cigars across the table,
and pushed the pan of coals toward his visitor. Before, however, Gibbs had time to utter a
word in reply, his companion, while lolling over the settee, caught up an opera-glass from
the table, and, placing it to his eyes, went on:

"Ha! ho! the fore-top-mast of my pretty long-legged schooner is gone. Pretty stick it was!
I suppose, Master Gibbs, that you"--he nodded fiercely without removing the glass--"cut it
up for that lovely new leg you've mounted. Ay, my beauty!" again apostrophizing the vessel,
which lay like a wounded bird in the calm inlet before him; "but where's my handsome barge,
that used to cover the long gun? Ho! stormy weather you've seen of late."

During all this one-sided conversation Gibbs had managed to wriggle his mutilated body on to
a wicker chair, where he steadied himself with his crutch, evincing manifest signs of choler
the while by running his fat fingers through the reddish door-mat of hair, hitching up his
trowsers, and rapping nervously his timber stump of a leg on the floor, until at last, unable,
apparently, longer to control himself, he burst out, with his bad face suffused with passion,

"I say, Captain Brand, it's time to end them 'ere gibes. What's took place is unfortinate;
but, howsoever, I has a bag of shiners and a wooden leg to show for it, and d----n the odds."

"Stop, stop, my bull-dog! Don't be profane in my presence, if you please. We are both Christians,
you know, and friends too, I hope."

This was said in a very precise, emphatic, and clear enunciation, and without apparent heat;
and Captain Brand smiled too--but such a smile, as his wide mouth came down with a twitch at
the corners, and left a sort of hole, where the cigar was habitually stuck, to see his teeth
through.

"And now, my friend, suppose you give me some little account of your cruise, and fill up, if
you can, any chinks that I haven't seen through already," he concluded, throwing his legs again
over the back of the settee, and elevating his eyebrows as the cigar smoke curled in spiral
wreaths around his face.

Mr. Gibbs hereupon settled himself more at ease in his chair, laid his crutch across his knees,
and began:

"I s'pose, sir, you got the news I sent in a letter from Matanzas, after we'd been chased out
of the Nicholas Channel by that Yankee corvette?"

Captain Brand nodded at the eye-bolt which held the green silk rope from the ceiling, as if
calculating mentally the strain it would bear, merely as a matter of philosophical speculation,
perhaps.

"Well, arter that--and a very tight race it was--we ran down to the Behamey Banks. There we
picked up a Yankee schooner loaded with shingles and lumber; and as the skipper was sarsy,
I just made him and his crew walk one of his own planks, and then bored a couple of holes through
his vessel, arter taking out some water which we stood in need of. You hasn't a drop of summut
to drink, has you, Captain Brand? becase it makes my jaw-tackle dry to talk much."

The captain merely motioned with a wave of his cambric handkerchief to an open liquor-case
which stood on a cabinet near, and to which Mr. Gibbs hobbled; when, seizing a square flask
of crystal incased in a network of frosted silver, he returned with it to the table. Had Mr.
Gibbs chosen he might have brought with the flask a small, thimble-shaped liqueur glass; but
he did not, and contented himself with a china coffee-cup which stood on the tray before him.
He seemed a little near-sighted too; and as he inverted the flask, gave no heed to the quantity
of fluid he poured into the cup. But he took care, however, that it did not run over; and then,
raising it with a trembling hand to his lips, he said, "My sarvice to you, Captain Brand,"
and tossed it down his capacious throat. The captain gave no response to this compliment, but
as Mr. Gibbs put down the coffee-cup he said blandly,

"Thank you; but suppose you put that flask back in the case. I am rather choice with that brandy;
it was a--given to me by a--person who was a--unfortunately hanged, and a--I rarely offer it
a--the second time."

Puffing his cigar as he spoke in an easy manner, he then turned round to listen to Mr. Gibbs's
narrative. Becoming more genial as the brandy loosened his tongue, Mr. Gibbs continued:

"Well, sir, from the Behameys we ran to leeward, nearly to the Spanish Main, in hopes, perhaps,
of finding some stray fellow as was bound to Europe; but we see nothing for days and days,
and weeks and weeks, till finally the water fell short again, and we beats up and runs into
Santa Cruz. There, as luck would have it, Eboe Pete and French Tom got into a bit of a scrimmage
up on a gentleman's plantation arter sunset, and was werry roughly handled by a patrol of sogers
as happened to be near. I believe as how Eboe Pete died that night; and I heerd, too, that
French Tom had his skull cracked; and what does he go for to do but make a confession to the
authorities that the 'Centipede' was a pirate!

"Well, captain, the moment that information reached me, and seein' a sogers' boat gettin' ready,
and the sogers running about the water-battery of the fort, than I just slips the cable, and
runs out to sea like a bird; and, Lord love ye, sir! the way they pitched round shot arter
us was--was--" Here Master Gibbs paused for a simile, and the captain observed with a hacking,
cough-like laugh,

"You saved the water-casks, though?"

"Why no, sir; and we was forced to go upon a 'lowance of a pint a water a man!"

"Ho!" rejoined the listener. "Capital! Didn't suffer, I hope? Go on."

"Howsomever, I says to myself, the captain wants a good valy'ble cargo, and so we beats up
again and stretches away back along the coast of Jamaiky, on the look-out for any think that
might be comin' that 'ere way. Well, sir, d'ye see, airly one morning, as we was a lying as
close as wax under the land, we spies a big brig becalmed off to seaward; but we diskivered
at the same time that same Yankee cruiser as was in chase of us off Matanzas. I know'd as how
you would be displeased at any risks being run, so we keeps clean and snug inshore, under a
pint o' land, till set of sun, and until arter the moon went down. Then the breeze sprung up
fresh from the old trade quarter, and says I, now we'll make a dash at that 'ere drogher, and
squeeze him as dry as bone-dust; more pertikerly, ye see, captain, since the corvette, arter
dodgin' about him all day, had yawed off, and, with his port-tacks aboard, was beatin' to wind'ard."

Here Mr. Gibbs's auditor took the cigar from his mouth and rolled his light blue eyes at him,
puffed a thick volume of smoke through the corner of his mouth, but said never a syllable.

The narrator gave a wistful look at the brandy-flask, drained the last few drops from the coffee-cup,
pushed out his timber leg, and resumed:

"So you see, sir, as I was a sayin', I says to myself, I'll get the boat in the water with
the lads, and, to make sure of all being conducted shipshape, I'll go myself."

"Oh!" said the captain, as his eyebrows went up and the corners of his mouth came down, with
the faintest breath of a sardonic smile, while he lit a fresh cigar, "oh! you did!"

"Ay, sir! So we let the old drogher go bouncing on past us, at about the rate of five mile
in four hours, when we crossed his wake under the jib, and then we ups with the fore and main-sail,
got a pull of the sheets, and--"

Captain Brand shook the point of his curved nose at the speaker, who checked himself, and,
giving an emphatic rap with his crutch on the floor, went on with--

"Beg parding, sir; but, Lord love ye! we just walked up under his lee, and afore he know'd
where he wos, we boarded him, knocked over two or three chaps, and had the skipper lashed down
in his cabin as quick as winkin' and as quiet as could be. Ay, sir, we had it all our own way;
but during the scrimmage wot should I see (here he inclined his head out like a loggerhead
turtle) but the lovelyest young 'oman as ever I clapped eyes on!" Here his timber stump grated
nervously on the floor. "Says I, that's just the craft, with such a clean run and full bows,
as would please Captain Brand"--at which that individual rolled round on his elbow and brought
his eye to the opera-glass in the direction of the schooner.

"She isn't there, captain!" parenthesized the narrator, following the motion with his head.
"So I just fisted hold of her to hand her tenderly into the boat, with a bag of shiners as
wos found on board, when, so help me---- --beg parding, sir--if a dwarfed giant of a nigger
didn't take an overhand lick at me with an iron pump-break, and nearly cut this 'ere larboard
pin in two pieces; and, smash my brains!" he continued, shaking his broad paw aloft with rage,
"but what does I do, with all the pain from the clip that da--(beg parding, sir) give me, I
slams away with a pistol bullet through the nigger's head--"

"Didn't I see a little boy on board the 'Centipede?' Perhaps I was mistaken, the sun blazes
so fiercely, eh?" broke in Captain Brand, though the sun didn't blaze with a fiercer light
than shot out of his deadly cold blue eyes.

"Ho, ay, sir! that young imp was a bitin' at my t'other leg like a bull terrier pup, while
the nigger was attackin' me, and then he goes and crawls out of the cabin winders, and was
fished out of the water by the chaps as wos towin' astarn in the boat."

"Oh, really! how very fortunate!" muttered the captain; "go on; don't stop, I pray you, Master
Gibbs."

"Well, sir, I knows very little what happened arter this, for the young 'oman was a screamin'
and our chaps a cursin' about the decks, when all of a sudden I fell off into a faint like,
and the same time a heavy gun came slamming into our very ears; and there was that infarnal
corvette agen bowlin' down within five cables' length of the brig, her battery all alight and
the whistles a callin' away the boats, in as violent a haste as any think I can remember,"
said Gibbs, as he paused to catch his breath.

"You must have kept a sharp look-out, though?" But, without heeding this remark, the burly
scoundrel went on--

"Well, Captain Brand, the boys tumbled me over the side--"

"Not forgetting the little bag of shiners!" sneered his auditor.

"Tumbled me into the boat, sir, and then pulled like mad for the schooner. I know'd, d'ye mind,
captain, or leastways I felt sartain we could show any think afloat our heels, and so away
we scrambles aboard, and off we splits. But ye must see by this time, sir, the corvette had
come down and rounded to on the weather beam of the drogher, acting like a screen for the schooner
close under his lee. It wos only a minnit, though, while he was holding some jaw with those
lubbers aboard the brig, before he filled away again, and wearing sharp round her bows, he
diskivered us sartain. I don't think, as matters stood by this time, that our boat was a boat-hook's
length from the schooner when I jist see a burst of red flashes from the man-o'-war's starboard
ports, and heerd an officer roar out, 'Give him the whole three divisions of grape!' when I'm
da--your parding agin, sir; I'm blest if ever I heerd sich a rain of cold iron in all my sea-goin'
experience. Ay, sir, by G--gracious, sir, if about two bushels of them grape didn't riddle
the barge like the nozzle to a watering-pot, and same time tore seven of our noble fellows
all to rags--"

"You saved the boat, of course?" suggested his companion, in a kind voice, but with a frightful
sneer.

"Why, captain, we unfortinately lost her; for ye see, arter tumbling me aboard the schooner,
and arter bailing nigh as much blood as water--"

"Capital! excellent! best joke I ever heard," broke in Captain Brand, with a hollow laugh of
much enjoyment.

"Arter bailin' as much blood as water, and finding the man-o'-war was heaving in stays to slam
another broadside into us, we cut the boat adrift, and then got the sheets flat aft, the gaff-top-sails
up, and away we drove with a crackin' breeze right up to wind'ard, like a swordfish. Lord love
ye, sir! we walked away from the cruiser, a eatin' the wind out of him like a knife, and notwithstandin'
he hove more nor forty round shot at us, he only knocked away the fore-top-mast and some other
triflin' little damage about the hull, and"--he hesitated--"Lascar Joe's head."

"That counts off about half your crew, eh?" said Captain Brand, smiling in his peculiar manner.
"Well, what next?"

"Why, sir, the next mornin' Belize Paul--as is part doctor, you know--said as how my leg was
to come off below the knee, and arter givin' me a sip or two o' rum--"

"Bottle," interjected the captain, twisting the beak of his nose in a puff of smoke.

"--Rum, why, smash my brains, sir, if he didn't hack it off with a wood-saw!"

"Well, what next?"

"Then, sir, ye see, we run the schooner down Cape Cruz, where we kept werry snug and quiet
till sich times as the old one-eyed Diego judged the coast clear to return to head-quarters."

"Well, what then?"

"That's all, Captain Brand!" concluded the narrator his garbled yarn, as he again had recourse
to scratching the door-mat on his head, and cast a thirsty look at the brandy-flask.

"That's all, is it?" hissed the man with the iron jaws, in a tone of concentrated passion,
as he sprang with a single bound from the settee, and clutched Master Gibbs with both hands
around his hairy throat until his face turned livid purple and his eyes started from the sockets.
"That's all, is it, you drunken beast? That's all you have to tell after idling away the summer,
losing anchors and boats, and more than half my crew, and bringing a hornet's nest down about
our ears! That's all, is it? And what would you say, now, if I should order the doctor to cut
off your other leg close behind your ears, you beast?"

In the last stages of suffocation, the man was hurled on his back to the floor, and there lay,
bleeding a torrent from his mouth and nose. His superior stood over him for a moment and put
his hand in his trowsers pocket for a pistol, and then he glanced rapidly at the green rope
squirming from the beams above; but, changing his purpose apparently, he strode back to the
settee and shouted "Babette!"

Presently the door opened from the passage leading to the kitchen, and there appeared a large,
powerfully-made negro-woman, with her arms akimbo, and a pair of bloodshot eyes gleaming from
beneath a striped Madras turban wound round her head.

"Babette!" repeated the captain, resuming his seat and his habitual polite air and voice, "serve
out a barrel of Bordeaux and a beaker of old Antigua rum to the 'Centipede's' crew to drink
my health; and I say, my beauty! have a pig or two killed; tell the boatswain to haul the seine,
and have a good supper for all hands to-night. And, Baba"--he went on as if he had just thought
of something--"there's my friend Gibbs lying there--I believe he has fallen down in a fit--be
very careful of him--a bed in the vault--a little biscuit and water--he may be feverish when
he wakes up, you know. And, Babette, old girl, if you are in want of kindling wood, you may
as well use that timber leg of our friend Gibbs! I don't think he'll want it again. There!
doucement, Baba!"

The negress gave a deep grunt of assent, and, seizing the senseless body lying on the floor,
she dragged it out of the room. Returning a few moments after, she wiped up the blood with
a cloth dipped in hot water, and finally disappeared.

CHAPTER X.

AN OLD SPANIARD WITH ONE EYE.

"The 'Panchita' has passed Mangrove Point," came in the hoarse whisper from the signal-man.
"You can see her now from below, sir."

Captain Brand put on a fine Panama hat, and stepped out on the veranda, where, with a cigar
in his mouth, he leaned over the balustrade, and kept sharp watch on every thing that was going
on below him. In a few minutes a long pointed brown bowsprit protruded itself beyond the wall
of rocks, followed by a great triangular lateen sail, bent to a yard a mile long, and tapering
away like a fly-fishing-rod, where, at the end, was a short bit of yellow and red pennant.
As her bows came into view they showed above a curved prow falling inboard, with a huge bunch
of sheepskin for a chafing-mat on the knob, and a thin red streak along the wales, on a lead-colored
ground, above her bottom, which was painted green. As more of her proportions came into the
picture, you saw a stout stump of a mast, raking forward, with short black ropes of purchases
for hoisting the single yard, and heavy square blocks close down to the foot of the mast. When
this great sail had come out from the screen of rocks, another light stick of a mast stood
up over the taffrail, with another lateen sail and whip-stalk of a yard, to which was bent
the Spanish Colonial Guarda Costa flag. In fact, she was a Spanish felucca all over, from stem
to stern, and truck to water-line. A few dingy hammocks were stowed about halfway along her
rail, and there were a good many men moving about her decks in getting the cable clear, and
a lot more clinging like so many lizards along the bending yard, and all in some attempt at
uniform dress, in readiness to roll up the sail when the anchor was down. There was a long
brass gun, too, burnished like gold, on a pivot slide, with all its equipment, trained muzzle
forward in front of the main-mast. No sooner had she sagged into the open basin, with her immense
sail hanging flat and heavy in the light air, than a boat from the schooner boarded her, and
presently she let go an anchor. There were a few coarse compliments and greetings exchanged
between the crews of the two vessels, and some rough jokes made, as the last comer veered out
the cable, rolled up his sails, and set taut his running gear in quite a tidy and man-of-war style.

"Go on board the felucca, José, and give my compliments to Don Ignaçio, and say I shall be
happy to see him," cried Captain Brand from the piazza to a man at the cove; "and tell him,"
continued he, "that I should have called in person, but I can't bear the hot sun since I caught
the fever. Take my gig."

This was said in Spanish, and when he had finished speaking he shaded his face behind the curtain
and scowled.

"You're a bird of ill omen, my one-eyed friend; but one of these days I'll wipe out old scores,
and new ones too, perhaps," Captain Brand muttered to himself; and, from his murderous expression
of face, he seemed just the man to carry out his threat. Meanwhile, a light whale-boat of a
gig, manned by four men and a coxswain, pushed off from the shore, and in three strokes of
the oars she was alongside the felucca. The coxswain stepped over the low rail, and, walking
aft, turned down a cuddy of a cabin, took off his hat, and delivered his message. A minute
later he again got into the boat, and pulled to the cove, where he said to the captain,

"Don Ignaçio says he'll come in his own boat when he's ready."

"Bueno!" was responded aloud; and then to himself: "Don't ask or receive favors, eh? What an
old file the brute is!"

He said no more, but watched. Presently a small man came up out of the cabin of the "Panchita,"
but so very slow, and with such a quiet motion did he emerge, that one might suppose it was
a wary animal rather than a human being. He was scrupulously neat in attire--a brown pair of
linen trowsers, a Marseilles vest with silver filigree buttons, an embroidered shirt-bosom
with gold studs, and a dark navy-blue broadcloth coat, with standing collar and anchor gilt
buttons. His head-gear was simply a white chip hat, with a very narrow brim and a fluttering
red ribbon; but beneath it his coal-black hair behind was chopped as close as could be, leaving
a single long and well-oiled ringlet on each side, which curled like snakes around a pair of
large gold rings pendent from his ears. His complexion was dark, bilious, and swarthy, with
a thin, sharp nose, and a million of minute wrinkles, all meeting above, at the corners, and
under a small line of a mouth; quite like rays, in fact, and only relaxed when the lips parted
to show a few ragged, rotten pegs of sharp teeth. But perhaps the most noticeable feature in
his face was his eye--for he had but one--and the spot where the other is seen in the species
was merely a red, closed patch of tightly-drawn skin, with a few hairs sticking out like iron
tacks. His single eye, however, was a jet black, round, piercing organ, which seemed to do
duty for half a dozen ordinary glims, and danced with a sharp, malevolent scrutiny, as if the
owner was always in search of something and never found it, and every body and every thing
appeared to slink out of its light wherever it glanced around. His age might have been any
where from forty to sixty. As he stepped on deck, clear of the cuddy cabin hatch, his sinister
optic played about in its socket--now scanning the long brass gun, the half-furled sails, the
crew, the ropes, or taking a steady, unwinking glance at the midday sun, and then shining off
to the shore, and sweeping in the "Centipede," the little pool of blue water, and the mouth
of the inlet. Feeling apparently satisfied with the present aspect of affairs, he slowly pulled
out a machero from his waistcoat pocket, plucked a cigarette from the case, and then proceeded
deliberately to strike a light. Even while performing this simple operation, his uneasy orb,
like unto a black bull's-eye, traversed about in its habitual way; and when he raised the spark
of fire with his brown, thin hand, and the claws of fingers loaded with rings, he seemed to
be looking into his own mouth. Nodding to a fellow who stood near, with a crimson sash around
his waist, he inclined his eye toward the shore, blew out a thin wreath of smoke from his lungs--all
the while his vigilant organ shining like a burning spark of lambent jet through the smoke--and
merely said,

"The boat!"

In a moment a small cockle-shell of a punt was lowered from the stern of the felucca, when,
stepping carefully in, he seized a scull, and with a few vigorous twists pushed her to the
landing at the cove.

During all these movements of the commander of the felucca Captain Brand was by no means an
inattentive observer; and, indeed, he was so extremely critical that he stuck the tube of a
powerful telescope through an aperture of the curtains around him, and not only looked at his
cautious visitor, but he actually watched the expression of his uneasy eye, and almost counted
every wrinkle--finely engraved as they were--on his swarthy visage; but, if Captain Brand's
own visage reflected an index of his mind, he did not seem over and above pleased with what he saw.

"Has a bundle of papers under his arm! I can see the hilt of that delicate blade, too, sticking
out from his wristband. Ah! I've seen him throw that short blade from his coat-sleeve and strike
a dollar at twenty yards! Wonderful skill with knives you have, Don Ignaçio; but you never
yet tried your knack with me! Oh no, my Tuerto--bird of ill omen that you are! We can't do
without one another just yet, so let us wait and see what's in the wind!"

Soliloquizing these remarks, Captain Brand withdrew his telescope as the commander of the felucca
approached, and, with a cheerful smile, waited to receive him. A few moments later the one-eyed
individual mounted the rope-ladder stairway, carefully feeling the strands, however, and looking
suspiciously around him as he stepped lightly on the piazza.

"Ah! compadre mio!" exclaimed Captain Brand, in Spanish, as he seized his visitor by the flipper,
and squeezed his fingers till the pressure on his valuable rings made him wince, as he was
led into the large and spacious saloon, while at the same time the captain gave him a hearty
slap between his narrow shoulders.

"Ah! compadre! How goes the friend of my soul?"

The small man gave no symptoms of joy at this warm greeting; but, screwing his wiry frame out
of the captain's caresses, his eye flashed like a spark of fire quickly up and down and all
around the apartment, as if making a mental inventory of the furniture, and not omitting his
tall companion, from the crown of his head to the toes of his straw slippers, when he quietly
remarked through his closed teeth,

"Como estamos?"--"How are we?"

"Ah, Don Ignaçio, poco bueno, poco malo! Half and half. Just getting well over that maldito
attack of Yellow Jack."

"Hum! more bad than good. No? I've brought you some letters from the agent at Havana."

"Thanks--thanks, my friend. Ho! Babette! Babette! Some anisette for Don Ignaçio. Presto! my
good Baba. There--that will do!" he said, merrily, as the liqueur and glasses were placed on
the table. "And don't omit the turtle-soup for dinner, and tell Lascar Joe to make it. Ah!
I forget--the best cook I had--the devil's making soup of him now. However, do the best you
can, my Baba, and let us have dinner about sunset."

Then turning to his visitor, with a graceful bow and a laugh, he added, "And we'll have the
doctor to join us, and tell how he cut off our poor friend Gibbs's leg with a hand-saw. Dios!
amigo! Capital joke, 'pon my honor!"

Captain Brand's honor! Lord have mercy upon us! And he had very few jokes, and never told one
himself.

"Hum!" replied the Tuerto, in the pause of the conversation. "There's better jokes than that
to hear. Mira! look!"

With this brief rejoinder he threw a bundle of newspapers on the table, and, pulling out a
packet of letters from a breast pocket, pitched it toward his host. Then helping himself to
a thimbleful of anisette, he took off his narrow-brimmed chip hat for the first time, polished
up his eye a bit with the knuckle of his fore finger, and looked at his companion fixedly.

"Letters, I see, from our old friend Moreno, at Havana," said Captain Brand, as he sat down
on the settee, and with a pretty tortoise-shell knife cut round the seals. "Ah! what says he?
'Happy to inform you,' is he? 'Packages of French silks seized by custom-house on account of
informal invoice and clearance.' Why didn't the fool forge others, then? Well, what next? 'Schooner
"Reel," from Barbadoes, with cargo of rum and jerked beef, wrecked going into Principe, and
crew thrown into prison on suspicion of being engaged in--' Oh! ah! served them right, when
I ordered them to St. Jago--delighted they must be! 'Bills for advances and stores now due,
please remit, per hands of Don Ignaçio Sanchez--'"

Here Captain Brand caught a ray from the one eye of his companion, which he returned with interest;
and then laying the letters down on the table with the softest motion in life, he exclaimed,
with a sigh,

"Not the best news in the world, as you say, compadre; all those rich goods, and those bags
of coffee, and pipes of rum gone to the devil. But these are little accidents in our profession."

"Como?" said Señor Ignaçio, "our profession?" shaking his fore finger before his paper cigar
in a deprecating manner. "Speak for yourself, amigo."

"Ah! true," the other went on--"my profession. The freedom of the seas, the toll of the tropics,
the right of search, and all that sort of buccaneering pastime, is liable, you know, to the
usual risks."

Here he inclined his head to one side and gave a slight clack to his lips, as if to illustrate
in a humorous way a man choking to death with a knotted rope under his ear. "However, we must
be more cautious in future and retrieve the past disasters, for there are still on the sea
as good barks as ever floated."

Captain Brand said this as if he were a merchant of large means and strict integrity, and was
about to enter into some shrewd commercial speculation.

"Hum!" murmured Señor Ignaçio, while pouring out another little glass of anisette. "Amigo mio!
you had better read the papers from Havana before you talk of another cruise."

"Oh! delighted to read the news--quite refreshing to get a peep at the world after being cooped
up here for months! Another French revolution! Bonaparte alive yet! A Patriot war! Nelson and
Villeneuve! All interesting."

Thus glancing rapidly over the prints, pausing at times at a paragraph that arrested his attention,
then tossing a paper away and taking up another, till suddenly Captain Brand's hand shook with
passion as he read aloud,

"His Britannic majesty's squadron has been augmented on the West India station. The brig 'Firefly,'
corvettes 'Croaker' and 'Joker,' touched at Nassau, New Providence, on the 2d instant, bound
to leeward. We also learn that the United States have fitted out a squadron of small vessels,
called the Musquito Fleet, to search for the noted pirate Brand, who has so long committed
atrocities among the islands. He was last chased by the American corvette 'Scourge,' off Morant
Bay, on the east coast of Jamaica, but escaped during the night. The following day a shattered
boat was picked up, which had been cut adrift from the piratical schooner, containing several
dead and dying bodies of the pirates. One of the latter gave such information to the captain
of the 'Scourge' as leads to the hope that Brand's retreat may soon be discovered and his nest
of pirates be destroyed. Recent advices from Principe state that a vessel loaded with valuable
merchandise struck on the Cavallo Reef and went down. The crew, however, five in number, were
rescued, but on landing were identified by the mate of the English bark 'Trident' as a portion
of the men who robbed that vessel and murdered the master and several of the passengers. Our
readers may remember that among the latter were two sisters, who leaped overboard and were
drowned, to save themselves the horror of a more cruel fate. The men alluded to, who were wrecked
in the brig off Principe, were sent in chains to Havana, and were yesterday publicly garroted
in the Plaza of Moro Castle."

CHAPTER XI.

CONVERSATION IN POCKETS AND SLEEVES.

    "He holds him with his skinny hand:
      'There was a ship,' quoth he.
    'Hold off! unhand me, graybeard loon!'
      Eftsoons his hand dropp'd he."

Captain Brand laid down the paper without a sign of outward emotion, and nodded his head several
times at the one-eyed man facing him. He then extracted his perfumed handkerchief, examined
the cipher in the corner, and waved it before his face. Don Ignaçio pulled out a red silk bandana,
and polished his eye as if it were the lens of a spy-glass. At length the former spoke:

"Amigo mio! The nets are spreading, but the fish are not in them yet!"

"No, amigo!"

"Ah! compadre, viento y ventura poca dura! the fair breezes have chopped round in our teeth.
Success, my friend, creates jealousy, envy, hatred, and malice. Now here were we swimming along
as quietly as sharks under water, only coming up for a bite occasionally, when on come those
villainous swordfishes, and wish to drive us away."

Captain Brand gave expression to this pious homily in a tone of virtuous reproach against the
world at large, and as if he were a very much maligned and ill-used gentleman. He touched the
bell overhead as he spoke, and, putting his mouth to the tube, asked,

"Any thing in sight?"

"Nothing, señor."

"Telegraph the man at the Tiger-trap station to keep a bright look-out, and direct the gunner
to keep the battery manned day and night! Tell the boatswain to set taut the chain on the other
side at the Alligator's mouth!"

Don Ignaçio gave a rather suspicious glimmer at his vessel as this last order was given, and
smiled; that is, if a one-sided twitch to the wrinkles about the line of his mouth could be
tortured into a smile. His companion seemed to divine what was passing in the Don's mind, for
he added politely,

"The cable won't interfere with the 'Panchita!'"

"No, amigo; the felucca is anchored just outside of it." The Tuerto was not a man to leave
any thing to chance, and he had taken the precaution to be on the safe side of the pirates,
either as friends or enemies. He had indeed been as near an approach to a pirate himself as
could be, and had only abandoned the business for a profession quite as bad, where there was
less risk and more profit. In other words, he was now a colonial officer in command of a Guarda
Costa, winking--but without shutting his eye--at piracy whenever he was well paid for it; and
he invariably was well paid for it, or else he made mischief. Withal, he was as crafty and
determined an old villain as ever sailed the West Indies. He had amassed a large fortune, and
owned several tobacco estates--pretty much all his wealth acquired by the easy trouble of holding
his tongue. Yet his greed was insatiable, and he probably would have sold the fingers from
his hands, and his legs and arms with them--all, save his single black ball of an optic, which
was invaluable to him--for doubloons. In fact, this feverish thirst after gold which always
raged in his hot veins had induced him to pay Captain Brand a visit, and we shall see with
what result. The truth is, however, that Captain Brand was the only man of his numerous villainous
acquaintance afloat for whom he felt the least dread. He knew him to be bold, skillful, and
wary, and so the Don had a tolerably positive conviction that, should he play him false, his
own neck might get a wrench in the garrote while he was throwing the noose for his coadjutor.

To return, however, to the pair of worthies sitting in conclave in the pirate's saloon: the
captain, resuming the conversation, observed in a careless tone, quite as if the subject under
discussion was a mere ordinary matter,

"When will this swarm of hornets be down upon us?"

The Spaniard blew a thick puff of smoke from his cigarette, and still holding it between his
teeth, while his eye glittered through the murky cloud, he replied,

"Perhaps a fortnight, a little more or less. I left St. Jago five days ago, with orders from
the Administrador to run down this side of the island, and procure information for the English
consul."

"Any cruisers down that way?"

"Ay! the corvette 'Scourge,' and the 'Snapper' schooner; they arrived the night before I sailed."

"Did you happen to see their officers, amigo?"

"Oh si! I had a long talk with the captain of the corvette at the custom-house."

"Holloa! and you told him--"

"Yes; I showed him a chart of the Isle of Pines, and pointed out how to get into the old hole."

Here the pair laughed short laughs, when Brand continued his questions with,

"And how did he take the bait?"

"Hooked him; for I heard him order his first lieutenant to be ready for weighing at daylight,
and say that my description tallied with that of the dying man they picked up in the 'Centipede's'
boat," replied the Tuerto, with a chuckle.

"Bueno!" exclaimed the pirate, as his face assumed an unwonted sternness, while he rested his
cheek on his left hand with the elbow on the table, and slipped his right into the pocket of
his trowsers.

"Bueno! amigo mio! But how do I know but you may have made a little mistake, and described
another haunt besides the Island of Pines, off in this direction?"

There was the faintest click of a noise in the captain's pocket as he spoke, but not so faint
but that it vibrated on the ear of the Spaniard, and, pushing back his chair a foot or two
from the table, he raised his right hand, the fore fingers and thumb slightly bent inward,
but grasping a jewel-hilted knife, whose dim blue blade glimmered up the loose sleeve. There
was nothing threatening apparently in the movement, though the two villains looked at each
other with a cold, murderous, unflinching glare.

The Don was the first to break the silence; and he said, in a low, hissing tone,

"Maldito! Because I had a little account of plata to settle with you before the men-o'-war
should roast you out. But beware, Capitano mio! I left a little paper at St. Jago with directions
where to find me in case I did not return in a certain time."

"Ho, compadre, how very cautious with your friends! Why, what has put such thoughts into your
head? Diavolo! we have stood by one another too long to separate now. There, my hand upon it."

Saying this, Captain Brand's whole manner changed, and, drawing his hand from his pocket, he
reached over toward his companion. The Don, however, watched him narrowly, and his eye shot
out a wary sparkle as he withdrew his hand, when, cautiously putting forth his own left, he
touched his cold, thin brown fingers to those of the man before him. This operation ended,
he quietly sipped a few drops of anisette, and rolled and lighted another paper cigar.

"Well, amigo, let us now proceed to business," said Brand, gayly, "for dinner will soon be
ready, and we have no time to lose. How stands the account?"

"The papers are on board the felucca, and it will be more convenient, when the settlement is
made, to come on board with the money. How would to-morrow morning do? There's no hurry."

"Just as you choose, friend of my soul! The doubloons, or the silk, or broadcloth are ready
for you at any moment. Pay you in any thing except the delicious wines of France. Bueno!" he
added, pulling out a splendid gold repeater, with a marquis's coronet on the chased back. "And
now, amigo, accept this little token into the bargain."

Don Ignaçio's fiery eye twinkled with greed, but it was only for a moment, when, giving a quick
glance at the coronet and coat of arms, he waved his fore finger gently to and fro, and shook
his head.

"What! No? Why, you know it once belonged to the Captain General of Cuba, old Tol de rol de
riddle rol--what was his name? He gave it me, you know, together with some other trinkets,
for saving his life--a--you remember? Very generous old gentleman--nobleman indeed--he was.
May he live a thousand years, or more, if he can!"

Ay, Don Ignaçio did remember the circumstance attending that generous transaction, and he remembered
to have heard, also, that the Captain General made a present of all his money and jewels with
the point of a broad blade quivering at his throat. He said nothing, however, in allusion to
this interesting episode, but he smiled meaningly, and went on with his cigar.

"Not take it, eh? Well, amigo, I must look you up something else; but now for dinner. Babette,
clear away for dinner. Here are the keys of the wine-cellar. The best, my beauty, and plenty
of it." Then turning to his companion: "Suppose we take a stroll to the Tiger's Trap; the sun
is sinking, and a walk will give us an appetite for the turtle-soup--vamanos!"

CHAPTER XII.

DOCTOR AND PRIEST.

While Captain Brand and Don Ignaçio Sanchez walked pleasantly along the pebbly shore of the
clear blue inlet to the Tiger's Trap, let us, too, saunter amid the habitations which sheltered
the pirate's haunt.

Apart from the mat sheds of the shelly cove of the basin, where the "Centipede" and "Panchita"
were anchored, there was a nest of red-tiled buildings which served the crew of the former
vessel for a dwelling when in port. It was pleasantly situated on a little sandy plateau, within
a stone's-throw of the water, and shaded by a cluster of palm-trees; while in the rear was
a dense jungle of canes and bushes, through which led numerous paths to a small lagoon beyond.
The buildings were of one story, constructed of loose stones, the holes plastered with yellow
clay, with broad, projecting eaves extending over roughly-built piazzas. They stood in a double
row, leaving a stone pavement yard between, where one or two cocoa-nut-trees lifted their slim
trunks like sentinels on guard. Two of the largest of these huts were mere shells inside, and
used for mess-rooms, exposing the unhewn girders and roof above, but all whitewashed and tolerably
clean. The floors were of rough mahogany boards, or heavy dark planks, and no doubt part of
the cargo of some Honduras trader who had fallen into the pirates' hands. Around the sides
of these mess-rooms were arranged small tables and canvas camp-stools, with eating utensils
of every variety of pattern and value, from stray sets of French porcelain to common delf crockery.
A large open chimney stood a little way off, where was a kitchen, in which the cookery was
carried on, under the superintendence of a couple of old negroes. Beyond the mess-rooms were
the sheds used for sleeping apartments, with lots of hammocks of canvas and straw braid hanging
by their clews from the beams, quite like the berth-deck of a ship of war. Bags and sea-chests
stood out from the walls, with bits of mirrors here and there, some with the glasses cracked,
and others in square or round gilt frames. All, however, was arranged with a certain degree
of order, and the floor was clean and well scrubbed. Another detached building, much smaller
than the rest, was divided by a board partition into two rooms. The first was used for a storeroom,
and was filled with bread in barrels, bags of coffee and sugar, hams, dried fruits, beans,
salt meats, and what not, but every thing in abundance, and apparently the very best the market
of the high seas could produce. A strong door protected this repository, with a wrought iron
bar and padlock. The other portion of the building was more habitable. There were chairs and
tables; a couple of upright bookcases with glass doors, one filled with books, odd numbers
of magazines, and old newspapers, and the other containing a multitude of vials, pots, and
bottles of medicine--a small apothecary's shop, in fact, together with two or three cases of
surgical instruments. Two elegant bureaus, with rosewood doors and mouldings, like those furnished
passenger ships to the East Indies, stood against the wall at either side; and near to each,
in opposite corners, were low iron bedsteads, without mattresses or bedding, and merely stretched
with dressed and embossed leather. For pillows were Chinese heel stools, and as for covering,
the climate dispensed with it altogether. Hanging against the wall were a couple of brace of
pistols and two or three muskets, and on the table stood a square case-bottle of gin, some
glasses, and a richly-bound breviary clasped with a heavy gold strap; but in no other part
of these huts were fire-arms ever allowed, and very rarely was liquor served out in more than
the usual daily half-gill allowance.

Seated at the table in the last room we have described were two men. One, the shorter of the
two, was dressed in a long, loose bombazine cassock, girded about his waist by a white rope,
which fell in knotted ends over his knees. Around his open neck was hung a string of black
ebony beads, hooked on to a heavy gold cross, which rested on his capacious breast, and which
the wearer was continually feeling, and occasionally pressing to his lips. His face was dark
and sensual--thick, unctuous lips, a flat nose, and large black eyes--while a glossy fringe
of raven hair went like a thick curtain all around his head, only leaving a bluish-white round
patch on the shaved crown. This individual was the Padre Ricardo, who, for some good reasons
best known to himself, had left his clerical duties in his native city of Vera Cruz and taken
service with Captain Brand. One of the reasons for leaving--and rather abruptly, too--was for
thrusting a cuchillo into the heart of his own father, who had reported him to his superior
for his monstrous licentiousness. The padre, however, always declared that he was actuated
entirely by filial duty in killing his old parent, to save him the pain and disgrace which
would have followed the exposure of his son! He still clung, though excommunicated, to the
priestly calling, and prided himself upon his fasts and vigils, never omitting the smallest
forms or penances, and saying mass from Ave Maria in the early morning to Angelus at vesper
time in the evening. For Captain Brand he was ready to shrive a dying pirate--and pretty busy
he was, too, at times--or hear the confession of one with a troubled conscience in sound health;
which, if important to the safety or well-being of the fraternity, he took a quiet opportunity
of imparting to his superior in command. In these pursuits he not only made himself useful
to Captain Brand, but he became more or less his confidant and adviser, and seemed to maintain
his influence by ghostly advice over the superstitious feelings of the men. The padre, however,
utterly detested the sea, and never touched his soft feet in the water if he could by any possibility
avoid it; but since he had plenty to eat and drink on the island, and no end of prayers for
his amusement when in charge of the haunt--as he was--to look out for the people who were left
when the "Centipede" sailed on a cruise, he thus passed the time in a delightfully agreeable
manner.

The companion who sat opposite to the padre was a tall, gaunt, cadaverous person, evidently
of French extraction, with something kind and humane about his face, but yet the physiognomy
expressed the utmost determination of character--such a heart and eye as could perform a delicate
surgical operation without a flutter of nerve or eyelid, and who would stand before a leveled
pistol looking calmly down the barrel as the hammer fell. His face was intellectual, and he
never smiled. His whole appearance portrayed a thorough seaman. Where he came from no one knew;
nor did he ever open his lips, even to the captain, with a reason for taking service among
his band. All known about him was that he landed from a slaver at St. Jago, and was engaged
by Don Ignaçio to serve professionally with Brand in assisting the patriots on the Spanish
Main. When, however, he reached the rendezvous of the pirates, and discovered that they were
altogether a different sort of patriots than he had bargained for, he nevertheless made no
objections to remain, and took the oath of allegiance, only stipulating that he should not
be called upon to take an active part in their proceedings. Here, then, he remained for nearly
three years, attending to the sick or wounded, taking no interest in the accounts of the exploits
of the freebooters around him--rarely, indeed, holding speech with any one save his room-mate,
the padre, or occasionally a dinner or a walk with Captain Brand. On the last expedition, however,
of the "Centipede," he had been induced to go on board, so that he might become a check and
guard over the brutal ruffian who had been placed temporarily in command; but, as we have already
seen, his influence had been of little avail.

There was yet another occupant of the room inhabited by the doctor and Padre Ricardo; and a
low moaning cry caused the former to rise quietly from his chair and approach the low iron
bedstead on his side of the lodging. There, beneath a light gauze musquito net, lay our poor
little Henri--his once round, rosy, innocent face now pale and thin, with a red spot on each
cheek, and a dark, soft line beneath the closed eyes. Uneasily he moved in his fitful slumber;
and putting his little hands together as if in prayer, he murmured, "Oh mamma, mamma!"

Beside the bed stood an unglazed jar of lemonade, together with a vial and a spoon. The doctor
drew nigh, and, gently pushing aside the curtain, stood looking at the child for some minutes.
Presently the little sick boy feebly stretched out his delicate, thin limbs, and unclosed his
eyes. Oh! how dim, and sad, and touching was that look, as he gave a timid, half-wild stare,
and then, closing the lids tight together, the hot drops bubbled out and coursed slowly down
his tender cheeks.

The doctor, with the gentleness of a woman, bent over him, and taking up his poor, limp little
hand, he remained feeling the fluttering pulse and catching the hot breath on his dark cheeks.
As if communing with himself, while a glow of compassion lighted up his careworn visage, he
muttered,

"By the great and good God, who hears me, if I save this child I will restore him to his heart-broken
mother!"

He sank down on his knees by the bedside as he made his vow, and letting the little hand rest
on the bed, he buried his face in his large bony hands. What thoughts passed through that man's
mind none but the Almighty knows; but when he arose his stern features had resumed their wonted
expression, and, pouring a little lemonade in a glass, he held it to the sleeper's lips. Then
moving noiselessly back to the table, he said, in a low tone,

"Padre, the boy will live. His fever is leaving him, and he will get well."

"Ave Maria! Santissima!" ejaculated the padre, crossing himself and kissing his cross; "I pray
for him. You must give him to me, doctor. I will make him a little priest, and he shall swing
the censer and chant the Misericordia when I get the new chapel built."

"Time enough to think of that, mi padre, when he gets strong again. But just now all the prayers
you can say for him will do him no good, and so I hope you won't put yourself to the trouble."

"Cierto, amigo, doctor; but don't sneer at the prayers of the Church. They do good; they ease
the soul and soothe the pangs of Purgatory."

"Ah! and how long do you expect to stop in Purgatory?"

"Ave purissima! What a question to ask your pious and devout Padre Ricardo!"

"Question the devil when you want fire," retorted the doctor, as he opened a book lying on
the table before him, and put an end to the dialogue. His companion quietly helped himself
to a measure of pure gin, and unclasped the covers of his richly-bound missal.

Scarcely, however, had their conversation ceased, when a hoarse hum of many voices was heard
in the direction of the sheds without, mingled with shouts in all tongues and uproarious laughter.

"Peste!" said the doctor, looking out of an open window; "the people have knocked off work
and are coming home to their supper. They seem to have brought some of the crew of the felucca
with them too. We shall have a loud night of it, for the captain has sent them a pipe of wine
and a barrel of rum to carouse with."

"Pobre çitos! they have had a hard time of it during the summer--short of rum, and water too,
I hear, and they need refreshment and repose. So many of my poor flock killed, too, by that
savage American corvette, and I not near to administer the last consolations and holy rite!"
sighed the padre, as he kissed the crucifix and bowed his head. "There is Lascar Joe, too,
among the missing! He refused the sacrament, infidel as he was, the day before he sailed; but
what turtle-soup he made!" The padre hereupon sighed deeply again, but whether for the loss
of the Lascar or the soup, no one knows.

The noise without increased--the rattle of crockery, the clinking of glasses, the moving of
feet, and all the sounds of hungry, boisterous sailors at table. Soon, too, a shout or cheer
would be heard, then a verse of a song, roars of laughter, and now and then the tinkle of a
guitar struck by vigorous fingers in waltz or fandango.

"Merçi!" muttered the doctor, as he looked compassionately at the sick child on the bed; "those
noisy wretches will, I fear, disturb the little boy, and it's as hot here too, padre, as the
place we all are going to."

"It is warm, my son!" he replied, as his thick unctuous lips parted with a smile at his companion's
allusion to another and a hotter place; "but I think our good capitano would have a cot slung
for my little priest in the saloon of the big building there. It is always cool on the crag,
you know."

"Ah! perhaps he will," said the doctor, reflectively; "I'll see about it."

Stepping again to the bedside of the little sufferer, he laid a hand gently on his forehead,
where the soft curls lay in confusion about his temples, and then quickly touching his pulse,
he regarded him attentively for a few moments, while at the same time a light glow of perspiration
came faintly over the innocent face and spread itself down the neck.

"His fever is breaking! Grace à Dieu!" whispered the doctor to the padre; "his breath is regular
and cool, and he is sleeping sweetly. Now, if you like, we will go to see the captain, and,
if he consents, I will carry the child when he wakes to the dwelling."

The doctor carefully closed the door of the room as he and his companion stepped out into the
open court-yard, and moved toward the spacious sheds beyond.

CHAPTER XIII.

A MANLY FANDANGO.

    "While feet and tongues like lightning go
    With--What cheer, Luke? and how do, Joe?
    Dick Laniard chooses Meg so spruce,
    And buxom Nell takes Kit Caboose."

    "Now around they go, and around and around,
    With hop, skip, and jump, and frolicsome bound,
           Such sailing and gliding,
           Such sinking and sliding,
           Such lofty curvetting
           And grand pirouetting,
    Mix'd with the tones of a dying man's groans,
    Mix'd with the rattling of dead men's bones."

Twilight had taken the place of the red sun, the stars came timidly out one by one, and then
in sparkling clusters the brilliant constellations illumined the blue heavens as the rosy twilight
faded again away. Then the ripple of the inlet came with a tranquil musical sound upon the
white pebbly beach, the lizards in the holes and crevices of the rocks began their plaintive
wheetlings, the frogs and alligators joined in the chorus from the low lagoon in the distance,
and the early night of the tropic had begun.

But louder far than the hum of the insects and reptiles, and brighter than the lamps of heaven,
arose the wild shouts and songs of the pirates carousing, where the torches and wax-lights
lit up the scene of their orgies with the glare of day. The great mess-room was a blaze of
light from candles and lamps, stuck in brackets or gilt sconces about the walls, or hanging
awry in broken chandeliers from the lofty beams. The remains of their feast had been cleared
away, and the tables were covered with bottles, cups, and glasses, with boxes of cigars and
pans of lighted coals. At one end of the room was a large table, on which was laid a black
cloth with a broad silver border--sometimes used by the padre on great occasions--and covered
with cards and piles of Mexican or Spanish dollars. At the other end was a raised platform,
where four or five swarthy fellows with guitars in their hands were strumming away in the clear
rattling harmony of Spanish boleros and dances, shrieking out at intervals snatches of songs
in time to the music, or twirling the instruments around their heads in a frenzy of excitement.
At the tables, too, were more of the excited band, vociferating with almost superhuman fluency
in various languages their exploits, pausing occasionally amid the hubbub to clink their glasses
together, and then chattering and yelling on as before. In the centre of the apartment were
some half dozen of the same sort, either spinning around the floor in the waltz, or moving
with a certain air of careless, manly grace one toward another in the gavotte or bolero. There
were at the least some sixty or seventy of these fellows in the room together, most of them
above the middle height, with finely-developed muscles, broad shoulders, bushy whiskers, and
flowing hair. They came apparently from all climes, from Africa to the Mexican Gulf, and their
features and complexions partook of every imaginable type, from the light skin and florid complexion
of the Swede, to the low brow, oval olive cheek of the Mediterranean, and the coal-black hue
and flat nose of the Bight of Benin. Their dress was uniform--frock collars cut square and
thrown well back over their ample chests; their nether limbs incased in clean duck or brown
linen trowsers, with silk sashes around their waists, and large gold rings in their ears. Mingled
here and there in the moving throng, or leaning over the large table with the black cloth cover,
were a few fellows in the uniform rig of the Guarda Costa, in navy jackets and black silk belchers
around their throats; but all were without weapons of any description, and were enjoying themselves
each after his fancy. Sentinels stood at the doors of the mess-room with drawn cutlasses over
their shoulders, so that in case of a violent quarrel or row, in dance, drinking, or gaming,
the culprits might be cared for.

While the uproar was at its height, and the lofty tiled roof was ringing with the gay and ribald
songs and shouts of the excited crowds, two persons appeared in the doorway at the middle of
the room, and entered. In a moment, as the busy revelers beheld them, the dance ceased, the
music of the guitars died away in a tinkling cadença, the glasses stopped clinking, the dollars
no longer chinked, and the songs and shouts were hushed. You might have heard a real drop for
a minute, until one of the individuals who had entered slowly walked forward a few paces and
threw his right hand aloft in salutation. Then burst forth a hoarse, simultaneous shout of

"Viva nuestro amigo! Viva el capitano!"

Captain Brand did not pause until he had reached the centre of the great hall, where he stood
calmly looking around upon the swarthy groups, who crowded about in circles at a respectful
distance from him; and then amid the silence he spoke up, in a frank, off-hand manner,

"Well, my men, I am glad to see you all once more around me. You have not been so successful
as I hoped, but we must take the good and ill luck as it comes, and I have no fault to find
with you. The times, however, are bad enough; for I have certain news that our retreat here,
where we have so long been hid, may be discovered"--the villains around held their breath and
let their cigars lie dead in their mouths--"but," went on their commander, "I shall do all
that is prudent in the circumstances for the benefit of all of us; and when we leave here you
will still have me for your leader, with my head, heart, and blade ever ready to advise or
protect you." As he stopped speaking another cheer arose:

"Viva, nuestro amigo! viva! viva! El 'Centipede' y el capitano! Hasta muerto! Long live the
captain! We stand by you until death!"

"Thank you, my friends; I have but one more word to say. The men who have the relief at the
signal-stations and the water-battery must keep sober. Now go on again with the music."

The captain, however, did not immediately quit the hall, but, while the revel began once more
with all its enthusiasm, he moved amid the crowd of its adherents and said a cheerful word to many.

"Ah! Pepe, your arm in a sling, eh! a graze of a grape-shot, eh? Why, Hans, you here! nothing
can hurt you! Well, Monsieur Antoine, how well thou art looking; and that pretty sweetheart
of thine at St. Lucie! Bah! never look sad, man; thou shalt see her again. What, my jolly Jack
Tar! an ugly scratch, that, across your jaw--a splinter, eh? Never mind; a little plaster and
half allowance of grog will put you all right again. So good-night, my friends. Adios!"

Saying these words, all addressed to the individuals in their different languages, he gave
a graceful wave of his hand and passed out of the building. As he rejoined his friend, the
commander of the "Panchita," who had waited at the threshold, while his wary glim of an eye
searched the faces and read the thoughts of all the villains who clustered about the room--they
both stepped out into the court-yard and sauntered pleasantly on toward the crag. They had
not, however, proceeded many paces before they encountered the padre and the doctor.

"Ah!" exclaimed the captain, who was in advance, "how goes it with my doctor?" shaking his
hand as he spoke. "Oh, mi padre, how art thou?" turning to Ricardo.

"Salve! my son; not been so well this morning, with the old rheumatism in my head."

"Drunk!" said sententiously the doctor.

Then again with a gay laugh to the other, "Well, my doctor, your first cruise has not been
so pleasant in the 'Centipede' as I hoped it might be, but the next may be more agreeable."

"Perhaps so, Captain Brand; but I shall have a word or two with you on that subject to-morrow;
and, in the mean while, señor, I brought a little boy back with me who is ill from fever, and
my quarters are so stifling hot, and the air from the lagoon is so bad, that I would like to
stow him for a day or so, with your permission, in your quarters, where it is cooler."

"Certainly, doctor; why not? my house and all in it are at your service. By the way, I was
about to ask you and the padre to dine with me and Don Ignaçio there. Will you join us? Yes?
Then let us move on, for dinner must be ready by this time, and it would be a sin to keep Babette
waiting."

Excusing himself for a few minutes, the doctor went for his sick charge, and returned with
him in his arms to the pirate's dwelling.

CHAPTER XIV.

A PIRATES' DINNER.

    "But the best of the joke was, the moment he spoke
    Those words which the party seemed almost to choke,
    As by mentioning Noah some spell had been broke,
    And, hearing the din from barrel and bin,
    Drew at once the conclusion that thieves had got in."

When the guests had assembled in the pirate's saloon it was some minutes before their host
appeared. When, however, he did step into the room from his private apartment adjoining, he
was altogether a different man in outward appearance than in the early morning. In place of
the loose sailor summer rig which he then wore, he was now attired as a gentleman of elegant
fashion of the time in which we write. His lower limbs were clothed with flesh-colored silk
stockings, and fitted into a pair of pointed toed pumps with buckles of brilliants that a duchess
might have envied. A pair of white cassimere breeches, which set off to advantage his well-shaped
leg, were tied in a dainty bow of rose-colored satin ribbon below the knee, and fitted him
like a second skin. His waistcoat was of rose-colored watered silk, embroidered with silver,
and which, with its flaps and ample proportions, was halfway hidden by a dress coat of green
velvet. This last garment had a sort of navy cut, with standing collar richly laced with silver,
gold buttons in a double row of the size of doubloons, with loose sleeves and cuffs heavily
laced with silver also. His linen was of the most gossamer fineness, the collar thrown slightly
back and confined by a single clasp of rubies the size of beans, while below was a frill of
cambric ruffles sparkling with opal studs framed in diamonds. The ruffles, too, at his wrist
were of the most beautiful point lace, secured by royal brilliants, and he was altogether a
dandy of such princely magnificence that the courtiers of the days of the old French monarchy
might have taken him for a study. His manner, likewise, was every way in keeping with his splendid
attire; and the ease and grace with which he excused himself to his guests for keeping them
waiting certainly denoted a knowledge of a higher order of breeding and society than that in
which his lot had been cast.

From the very moment of his entrance, however, Don Ignaçio had measured him at a glance. His
single glittering eye of jet had taken him in from the laced collar of his coat to the buckles
of his shoes. Not a jewel in his dress, from the flaming opals in his bosom to the brilliant
stones at his wrists, and down to the sparkling clusters at his feet, did not his one uneasy
optic drink in the flash and estimate the value. Nay, he calculated by instinct the weight
of the gold buttons on his coat and the price of the exquisite lace which fell in snowy folds
about his hands. Oh, a rare mathematician was Don Ignaçio! What greedy thoughts, too, passed
through that little Spaniard's brain! "Ah!" thought he, "shall I take my debt in those priceless
gems, each one the ransom of a princess, which the old Captain General may one of these days
reclaim? Hola! no! Or shall I receive more negotiable commodities in gold, cochineal, or silks?
Well! Veremos! we shall see!"

The effect produced upon the good Padre Ricardo was altogether different. As the captain entered
with all his glorious raiment upon him, he started back, and, bowing before him as if he were
Saint Paul himself, he seized his superior's white hand, and kissed it with fervent devotion.
Not satisfied with this mark of respect, he raised his dingy paws, holding his crucifix before
him, and murmured, in a sort of ecstasy,

"Mi hico! mi capitano! que brillante!"--"My son! my captain! what a brilliant being you are!"

Singularly in contrast, however, was the effect produced upon the doctor, who merely raised
his dark eyes in an abstracted gaze, gave a careless and rather contemptuous nod of recognition,
and then turned to examine one of the richly-inlaid cabinets which adorned the saloon. All
these various phases of sympathy, attraction, or contempt flickered like a sunbeam into Captain
Brand's reflecting brain, as, with a delicately-perfumed handkerchief in one hand, and a gold-enameled
and diamond-incrusted snuff-box in the other, he bowed gracefully to his visitors, and seated
himself at table.

The table was now rolled out into the centre of the saloon, laid with a snowy-white damask
cloth, and covered with the equipage for a banquet. At either corner were noble branches of
solid silver candelabra, which would have graced an altar, as perhaps they had, and holding
clusters of wax-lights, which shed their rays over the display below. In the centre arose a
huge épergne of silver, fashioned into the shape of a drooping palm-tree, whose leaves were
of frosted silver, and about the trunk played a wilderness of monkeys. Beneath, around the
board, were cut-glass decanters, flat bulbous flasks of colored Bohemian glass, crystal goblets,
delicate and almost shadowy wine-cups from Venice, silver wine-coolers, all mingled in with
a heterogeneous collection of rare china and silver dishes. Such wines, too, as filled those
vessels! not a prince or magnate in all the lands where the vine is planted could boast of
so rare and exquisite a collection. Pure, thin, rain-water Madeira, full threescore years in
bottle! Pale, limpid Port, whose color had long since gone with age, and left only the musk-like
odor; flasks of Johannisberg of pearly light; bottles of Tokay for lips of cardinals; tall,
slim stems of the taper flasks of the Rhine; while the ruby hues of wine from the Rhone stood
clustering about amid pyramids of pine-apples, oranges, and bananas, and all loading the air
of the saloon with their delicious fragrance.

When the party had become fairly seated around the board, and while the host was bailing out
the soup from an enormous silver tureen with a tea-cup--for it did not appear that he had ever
been presented in the usual way with a ladle--fishing out the floating morsels of rich callipee,
with the delicate frills of his sleeves turned back, he began the conversation in the Castilian
language:

"Well, amigos, we are taking our last feast together, I fear, on this little cluster of rocks,
for a long time to come."

"How!" exclaimed the padre, as he stuffed a wedge of turtle fat in his oily mouth, and opened
his round black eyes to their fullest extent in manifest surprise.

"Como, mi hico!" he repeated, as he passed a dirty paw over his smooth chin, and looked inquiringly.

"Yes, holy father, our good friend Don Ignaçio here has brought us somewhat startling intelligence.
Capital soup, this. I shall give Babette a dollar. Yes, the eagles and vultures are after us;
all the West India fleet; the Lord only knows how many ships, and brigs, and gun-boats. Glass
of Madeira with you, doctor?" wiping his thin lips with a corner of the damask table-cloth
as he spoke; "and they have tampered, too, with my old friends the custom-house people. Take
away the tureen, Babette--and, in point of fact, I shouldn't be the least surprised to see
a swarm of those navy gentlemen off the reef here at any moment. A sharp knife, Babette, for
these teal--a duck should be cut, not torn. Try that Moselle, Don Ignaçio; I know your fancy
for light wines. This was given me by a Captain--'pon my soul, I forget his name; he had such
a pretty wife, Madame Matilde," glancing at the frame of miniatures on the wall; "sweet creature
she was; took quite a fancy for me, I believe, and might have been sitting here at this moment,
but a--really I forget her other name. However, it makes no difference: the wine is called
Moselle."

Now be it here observed that Don Ignaçio drank very little wine or stimulants of any sort,
and never by any chance a drop from any vessel which, with his single bright eye, he did not
see his host first indulge in. This self-imposed sacrifice may have been owing to his diffidence,
or modesty, or deference to Captain Brand, or, perhaps, other and private reasons of his own;
but yet he never broke through that rule of politeness and abstemiousness. Sometimes, indeed,
he carried his principles so far as to refuse a meat or the fruits which his host had not partaken
of, and always with a slow shake of his brown fore finger, as if he did not like even to smell
the dish presented to him.

"What! not even a sip of that nectar, compadre mio?"

The compadre shook his digit, and observed that drinking nectar sometimes made people sick.

The captain laughed gayly, and said, "Bah! learning to drink does the harm, and not the art,
when properly acquired."

During all the foregoing interlude the doctor remained in his grave, calm humor, and only when
the captain alluded to the lady whose husband's name escaped him did he show signs of interest.
Then his eye followed the look toward the miniature, and his jaws came together with a slight
grating spasm.

Padre Ricardo, however, was in excellent sympathetic spirits, eating and drinking like a glutton
of all within his reach, and turning his full eyes at times, as if to a deity, upon his friend
the captain. Once he spoke--

"But, my son, you were talking of leaving this quiet retreat, where we have passed so many
happy hours."

"Yes, friend of my soul! Those fellows with commissions, and pennants at their mast-heads,
and guns, and what not, seem determined to do us a mischief." The devout padre crossed himself,
and pressed the crucifix to his greasy lips. "Ay! they would no doubt arraign us before some
one of their legal tribunals. Put us in prison, perhaps; or maybe give us a slight squeeze
in a rope or iron collar!"

The padre groaned audibly, and dropped the wing of a teal he was gnawing, forgetting, strange
as it may seem, to cross himself.

"Hola, mi padre! cheer up! We are worth a million of dead men yet. The world is wide, the sea
open, and with a stout plank under our feet and one of these fellows"--here he balanced a long
carving-knife, dripping with blood-red gravy, in his hand--"in our belts, who can stop us?"

There was the cold, ferocious-eyed gleam of a dying shark in the speaker's eyes as he went
on with his carving; but the priest gave a jerk of trepidation with his chin, and appeared
anxious to hear more.

"Don Ignaçio, try a bit of this roast guana; it's quite white and tender. No? Babette, give
me some of that rabbit stew!" The one-eyed individual was likewise helped to some of that savory
ragoût, and proceeded to pick the bones with much care and deliberation.

"Still triste, my padre! Come, come, this will never do. Join me in a bumper of this generous
old Port. Bueno! may we attain the same age! By the way, where did this rich stuff come from?"
holding up the decanter between the light and his face as he spoke.

Don Ignaçio's glittering optic pierced clear through the light ruby medium of the wine, cut-glass
decanter and all, as he furtively watched his host, and was prepared to dodge in case the heavy
vessel should slip out of the captain's hand. Such things had happened, and might again; besides,
a hard flint substance with a multitude of sharp projections, two or three inches thick and
five or six pounds in weight, falling from a height on a man's head, might kill him. The Don
thought of all this, and twitched something up his sleeve with his hand under the table. But
Captain Brand, it seemed, had no intention of smashing his elegant dinner set of glass, and
putting down the decanter and raising a finger to his forehead, he said, "How did that wine
come into my possession?"

"Somebody gave it to you, perhaps. Quien sabe? (Who knows?)" suggested Don Ignaçio.

Without heeding the interruption, the captain's eye rested on the brilliant snuff-box on the
table beside him, where the letter L was set in diamonds and blue enamel on the back, and catching
it with a rap, his face lighted up, and as he took a pinch and passed the box to the padre,
he exclaimed,

"Ah! now I remember, my old friend--the Portuguese countess from Oporto. Dios! de mi alma!
(God of my soul!) what a stately beauty was her daughter!"

Here Captain Brand sneezed, and, drawing a delicately-perfumed lace handkerchief from his waistcoat
pocket, blew his nose. Meanwhile the box went round the table; Padre Ricardo took a huge pinch
with his dirty fingers, and feasted his eyes upon the precious lid. The doctor scarcely gave
the elegant bawble a glance as he helped himself. The Don, however, examined it with the eye
of a connoisseur, and not only that, but he threw a spark at the captain's flashy waistcoat,
and thought he detected some other article in the capacious pockets vice the handkerchief.
Perhaps he may have been mistaken and perhaps not, though he was so very suspicious an old
villain that he sometimes did his friends injustice. Nor did he put his thin brown fingers,
with the few grains of snuff he had dipped from the box, to his sheepskin nostrils till he
had watched the effect it had produced on those around him.

"Ah! my friends, I remember distinctly now all about it," continued the captain, as he returned
the kerchief and shook a few specks of the titillating dust from his point-lace sleeve; "it
is about three years ago, just before you came to live with me, padre, that we fell in with
a large ship bound to Porto Rico. She had been disabled in an awful hurricane, which had taken
two of her masts clean off at the decks, and was leaking badly. We, too, had been a little
hurt in the same gale, and having made a pretty good season, I was anxious to get back here
and give the crews a rest. Well, we made out the ship about an hour before sunset, and it was
quite dark before we came up with her. There she lay, rolling like a log, though there was
not much sea on, and we could hear her chain-pumps clanking, and saw the water spouting out
from her scuppers as pure almost as it went into her hold. As we came up alongside they hailed
me for assistance, and said the ship was sinking, and could not live till morning.

"Of course I could give them no actual assistance, situated as I was"--here the narrator smiled
as he glanced round upon his guests--"it would have been simply absurd, you know, the idea
of my putting men on board to keep her afloat for the nearest gibbet. Bah! I did not dream
of such ridiculous nonsense. However, I determined to make her a visit, and, if there should
be any thing to save from the wreck in an undamaged condition, why, I should look around.

"Not too much of that Port, mi padre; think of your rheumatism in the morning! Doctor, you
don't drink!

"Well, going on board, I found two lady passengers--the wife and daughter of an old judge of
the island of Porto Rico, with half a dozen servants, who were all screaming, and praying,
and beseeching me to save them--all but one, a tall, graceful girl, with a large India shawl
wrapped around her shoulders, her white arms glancing through the folds, and a pair of dark,
liquid, almond-shaped eyes, such as I had never before seen. The fact is, my friends, I had
always before fancied blue. But there stood this girl, with eyes like a wounded stag, leaning
up against the weather bulwarks near the open cabin door.

"Babette, take away all but the wine and fruit, and bring fire. Pass that box this way, if
you please, compadre! Thank you."

Don Ignaçio seemed to have an affection for the trifle, and had counted the brilliants over
and over again, and made a mental calculation of their weight and value; and when he did move
it as he was desired, his greedy eye followed it with fascination.

"Yes, it's very pretty, and I set a great store by it," parenthesized the host, as he resumed
his tale:

"The girl never screamed or even spoke, and, amid all the hubbub of a drunken skipper and a
disorderly crew, she remained quiet and unmoved. To assure the people, I told them that I would
stay by the ship and do what I could for them. At this the old lady clasped me around the neck,
and kissed me, and blubbered over me more than ever she did, I imagined, to the old Spanish
judge, her husband--imploring me too, by all the saints she could think of, to take herself
and daughter out of the sinking vessel at once. You may believe that I would much rather have
been treated in that way by the lovely girl with the wonderful eyes instead of the fat, rancid
old woman beside her; but there was no help for it just then, and so I consented, with all
the professions of sympathy I could make, to do as she desired."

Here the captain lit a pure Havana, and, after a few puffs and a sip of Port, continued:

CHAPTER XV.

DROWNING A MOTHER TO MURDER A DAUGHTER.

    "At last she startled up,
      And gazed on the vacant air
    With a look of awe, as if she saw
      Some dreadful phantom there."

"No sooner had I assured the old lady that I would transfer them to my vessel than her daughter
made a step forward, and, letting her shawl fall upon the deck, she seized my hand with both
of hers, and said, in a low contralto voice,

"'Heaven bless you, señor!'

"By the cestus of Venus, caballeros, the pressure of that girl's hand, and the deep, speaking
look of gratitude she gave me out of her liquid eyes, quite did my business!"

"And the señorita's too, I think," chimed in the one-eyed commander, as he wagged his uneasy
head at the narrator.

"Quien sabe?" (who knows?) went on Captain Brand: "at all events, I raised her soft patrician
hand to my lips and kissed it respectfully. Ha! I noticed, too, as I released her round, slender
fingers, that she wore a sapphire of great brilliancy--ay, here it is now. I keep it in remembrance
of the girl."

Saying this, the host shook back the lace ruffles of his sleeve, and, crooking his little finger,
exhibited the jewel to his guests.

"Go on, my son," said the padre, as his sensual face expressed his satisfaction at the recital--"Vamonos!"

"My holy father," responded the narrator, "beware of that wine-flask! You have grand mass to-morrow!
it is the feast of our patron saint, you know."

"Si! si! hijo mio! your padre is always ready," crossing himself in a half tipsy way as he
spoke--"Vamonos!" The doctor looked as cold as marble, and said not a word.

"Well, gentlemen," went on Captain Brand, "I soon got that ship in a tolerably wholesome state
of command. I made my trusty old boatswain, Pedillo, lock the fuddled skipper up sound and
tight in his own stateroom, and the rest of my men took a few ropes' ends, and belted the lubbers
of a crew until they went to work at the pumps with renewed vigor. I also insisted upon the
scared male servants of the passengers lending a hand at that innocent recreation, for you
see I had no intention of letting the ship go down--"

"With the Capitano Brand in her," interrupted Señor Sanchez.

"No, by no manner of means; for the ship, I felt, was settling fast, and I could hear the loose
cargo, which had broken adrift below in the main hold, playing the devil's own game; smashing
and crushing from side to side as the vessel rolled, and coming in contact with the stanchions
and beams, with a surging swash of water, too, which told the tale without the trouble of breaking
open the hatches. I took, however, the precaution to run my eye over the manifest to see if,
perchance, there was any treasure in the after run or any where else, as, in case there had
been, I should have made some little effort to get at it. However, there was nothing on board
but wine, dried fruits, and heavy bale goods, not worth the time or trouble, in the aspect
of affairs at that time, to save as much as a single cask or a drum of prunes. I glanced, too,
at the clearance list, and saw that the names of the passengers were La Señora Luisa Lavarona,
and the Señorita Lucia, lady and daughter, with half a dozen orders and titles, of the judge
in Puerto Rico. Bueno! roll me an orange, if you please, doctor! Ah! gracias, thanks."

The doctor rolled the orange, and, had it been a grape-shot or any other iron missile, its
aim would have gone straight through the captain's body, just above his left waistcoat pocket.

"In the mean while the old lady rushed around in a tremendous hurry, in and out of the cabin,
losing her balance occasionally in the lurches, ordering her maids to pull out trunks and boxes
on to the deck; then giving me a hug to relieve her feelings, and praying and crying between
whiles in the most whimsical manner. Not contented either with getting out a pile of luggage
and chests that would have swamped a jolly-boat, she insisted upon waiting until a locker was
broken open in the cabin pantry for the purpose of rescuing six cases of old Port wine, which
had been, she told me, sent as a present from the Archbishop of Lisbon to his friend the judge.
At this juncture I persuaded her to send her daughter and a few light articles first on board
my vessel, when the boat would then return for herself and the remainder of their property.
Accordingly, I carefully wrapped the lovely girl in shawls and cloaks, and got her over the
side and down into my boat, pitched a few light caskets and cases in after the young beauty,
and then, with a quiet word or two into Pedillo's sharp ear, the boat shoved off. I suppose
it may have been half an hour before my boat returned, and then I learned from the coxswain
that he had shown his charge down into my private cabin, and she appeared as comfortable and
resigned as possible. Well, we made quick work of it now, tumbled a good many things into the
boat, when I myself got in to receive the old lady and her retinue. By the way, among the articles
were the boxes of wine--this is some of it"--tapping the decanter, now nearly empty from the
attacks of the priest--"and in my opinion it does great credit to the taste and judgment of
that venerable archbishop."

"Ave, purissima!" said the padre, with a hiccough; "I shall be a bishop myself one of these
days. Ora pro nobis!"

"You'll be a cardinal," gibed in the doctor, "if swilling wine will do it."

Captain Brand went on with his narrative:

"Where was I? Oh! ah! We were waiting alongside the ship, with her lower chain-plates not a
foot above water, for the donna to be hoisted over the rail, since she would not permit any
of her attendants to precede her--though Heaven knows they were anxious enough to do so. By
this time, too, after my men had left the deck of the ship, the crew had somehow got hold of
a barrel of wine, and, letting the pumps work themselves, were guzzling away in grand style.
I began to lose patience at last, and shouted to the old lady to come at once, or I should
be compelled to leave her. She merely leaned over the rail, however, and chattered forth that
all she had in the world was at my service--of course, figuratively she meant--but she must
stay another minute to find a jar of preserved ginger, which was her only cure for the cholic."

"You didn't take the offer of the old lady as a figure of speech, I presume?" asked the doctor.

"No!" muttered the one-eyed old wretch, with a sneer. "And that jar of ginger spared her any
more attacks of cholic!"

"Caballeros, you are both right. I did accept the gift of her worldly goods in the frank spirit
in which it was offered, without any reservation; and, to my almost certain knowledge, the
Señora Lavarona was never more troubled with illness of any kind.

"The fact was, that, finding the ship fast sinking, and her crew becoming boisterous and rebellious
as the imminent danger burst upon them, they proposed, since their own boats were stove, to
take possession of mine! That was a joke, to be sure! A dozen drunken swabs, with naked hands,
to capture ten of the old 'Centipede's' picked men, with a pistol and knife each under their
shirts; and"--here the speaker laughed heartily--"and Captain Brand beside them! Diavolo! what
silly people there are in this world!"

The good padre joined his superior in this ebullition of feeling, and seemed to enjoy the joke
immensely, rolling his goggle eyes and head from side to side, kissing his crucifix, and exclaiming,
with devotion,

"Que hombre es eso!"--"What a man he is!"

"Well, señores, the next minute we let go the painter and floated astern past the ship's counter,
and a few strokes of the oar-blades sent us dancing away to leeward, where the schooner was
lying with her main-sail up, and the jib-sheet hauled well to windward. We made no unnecessary
noise in getting alongside, and it took no great time to get the boat clear, a tackle hooked
on, and to swing her on board over the long gun. Then we drew aft the sheets, set the fore-sail,
and the 'Centipede' was once more reeling off the knots on her course."

"But the ship, my son?"

"Why, my padre, I was so busy attending to the schooner, and afterward going below to break
the sad news to my lovely dark-eyed passenger of the loss of her mother, that I had no time
to devote to the ship. Pedillo, however, told me that he heard a good deal of frantic shrieking,
and prayers, and cursing, with, for a little while, the renewed clank of the chain-pumps, but
after that we had got too far to windward to hear more. About midnight, though, Pedillo and
some of the watch thought they saw a white shower of foam like a breaking wave, and a great
commotion in the water, but that was all. So, you see, what really became of that old craft
we do not positively know; though for a long time afterward I read the marine lists very attentively,
yet I never saw any accounts of her arrival at her destination.

"Perhaps," added Captain Brand, with a peculiar smile, as he lit a fresh cigar, "her arrival
may have escaped my notice, as I hope it may, though I think not."

Don Ignaçio intimated, by waving his fore finger to and fro, that such a hope had no possible
foundation in fact; and he stated, too, that he knew the underwriters had paid the full insurance
on the missing ship.

"Ah! well, that seems to settle the matter, truly," murmured the captain, as if he had long
entertained painful doubts on the subject, and now his mind was finally relieved.

"But, hico mio! Son of mine! La Señorita--hiccough--with the almond-shaped eyes--Santissima!--hic--how
did she bear the--death of her--hic--mother?"

"Por Dios, padre! there was a scene which would have drawn tears from a--"

"Pirate," suggested the doctor.

The padre blubbered outright, and his round, tipsy eyes nearly popped out of his head.

"Ay, monsieur, even from mine! But to go back a little. When I had got all snug on board the
schooner, I went below, and moved softly on tiptoe along the passage to the door of my beautiful
cabin.

"You remember, amigo," said the narrator, turning toward Don Ignaçio, "how that cabin was fitted,
and how much it cost to do it. I think you paid the bill for me? No?"

Oh yes, Captain Brand was quite right. Don Ignaçio remembered it well, and the bill was a thousand
gold ounces, sixteen thousand hard silver dollars; and by no means dear at that, for the Don
never allowed any body to cheat him.

"Cheats himself, though, sometimes. Don't charge more than the usual commission."

The one-eyed usurer looked wicked at this remark, but he said nothing, being occupied at the
moment rolling up a paper cigar with one hand, and wetting the brown fore finger of the other.

"Well, caballeros, I peeped through the lattice-work of the cabin door, and there reclined
my pretty prize--I recall her as if it were yesterday--on one of the large blue satin damask
lounges of the after transoms. Her head rested on one of her round ivory arms, half hidden
in the luxurious pillows; her shawl, too, was thrown back; and with a somewhat disordered dress,
and a mass of glossy hair clustering in ringlets about her neck and white shoulders, I thought
then, as I do now, that she was a paragon of loveliness. I saw her, as she thus reclined, by
the light of a large shaded crystal lamp, which hung by silver chains from the cabin beams,
and shed a rose-tinted effulgence over the whole apartment. When I first approached the door
the girl was looking out of her own large liquid lamps, so superbly framed in a heavy fringe
of dark lashes, in evident curiosity around the elegant cabin. Her looks wandered from the
Turkey carpet on the floor to the beautiful silk hangings, that exquisite set of inlaid pearl
ebony furniture, the display of knickknacks, and Dresden porcelain panels of the sides, and,
in fact, nothing seemed to escape her; and the good taste of the fittings evidently met her
approbation. At times, too, she would turn her gaze out of the narrow little window of the
stern, and peer anxiously over the vessel's wake, which by this time was skimming along like
a wild duck, and leaving countless bubbles behind her. At the first sound I made, however,
in opening the door, she started up and stepped forward to meet me.

"'Oh, Señor Capitano, mi madre! (My mother!) What detains her? We seem to be going very fast
through the water!'

"I gently took the girl's outstretched hands and led her back to the cushioned transom. Then
I told her, as kindly as I could, that I did all in my power to save her good mother, but that
the crew had mutinied--they had taken possession of the unfortunate ship--great confusion existed--and
as I feared, you know, that my own boat would be swamped by remaining longer alongside, I was
compelled to leave her to her fate.

"'But my mother, señor!' exclaimed the girl, with anguish; 'she was saved?'

"'No, señorita,' I said, 'she went down with the ship; but the last words she uttered--that
is to me--were to invoke a blessing on my head, and to consign all she possessed to my care.'
The poor thing swooned away as I uttered these words, and it was a long time before she came
to again. When she did, however, regain consciousness, tears came to her relief, and I did
all I could to soothe her distress by telling her that, if the wind came fair, she would in
the course of a few days be restored to her father."

"But the wind didn't come fair, eh?" broke in Don Ignaçio, "and she didn't see--"

"No, amigo, the wind held steady from the opposite quarter, and I thought it better not to
beat up with a fished fore-mast, and all that--and a--she did not see her father."

Captain Brand here wet his thin lips with a few sips of wine, said, "Babette, bring coffee!"
and resumed his story.

"When the girl became a little more calm I induced her to retire to my stateroom, where I left
her to sob herself to sleep. Don't spill that coffee, Babette, and put the liqueurs on the
table. There, that will do, old lady.

"Well, señores, the next morning my pretty prize was too ill to leave her room; but, as I handed
her a cup of chocolate through the door curtains, she thanked me with much gratitude for what
I had done, and knew that her dear father, the judge, would bless me."

"So he will," snarled the one-eyed old rascal, "if he ever catches you, when he draws the black
cap over your head."

"Possibly he may, though perhaps it will be some considerable time before he has that pleasure."

"Ah! cuidado hico mio! Take care of yourself, my son," hiccoughed the priest as he crossed
himself. The captain gave a light laugh, sipped his coffee, and went on as if a dungeon, scaffold,
and noose were the last things he ever thought of.

"I amused myself during the day in looking over the trunks, caskets, and what not we had saved
from the sinking trader--presented to me, as you know, by the old lady who was on board. There
were, of course, a great quantity of ladies' dresses, and a good many jewels and trinkets;
among the latter this fine snuff-box here, which our friend Don Ignaçio so much admires, and
which I set aside as an especial testimonial of the old lady's regard. Try another pinch, amigo?
No? Bueno! I caused what I believed to be the daughter's elegant raiment to be placed in the
after cabin. For three days I never even saw my pretty passenger, though I heard her low, sweet
voice occasionally when I laid out something for her to eat in the adjoining cabin. She sang,
too, some little sad songs with a voice which vibrated upon my ear like the notes of an Æolian
harp sighing in the night wind. Dios! how I regretted then and afterward that I did not have
a cabinet piano!"

"Presented to you," suggested the doctor.

"Yes, presented to me, so that she might have touched the keys with those ivory and rose-tipped
fingers.

"So the time passed, the schooner flying on under whole sails, the wind about two points free,
and the weather as fine as silk. It was the fourth evening, I think, after parting with the
Oporto trader that I induced my fair passenger to come on deck and take a little breath of
sea-air. You will observe, caballeros, that I did not make this suggestion in the daytime,
because the 'Centipede's' crew, you know, were rather numerous, and some of them not so handsome
in point of personal looks as ladies at all times care to behold. Besides, there were certain
things about the decks--racks of cutlasses, lockers of musketry along the rail, and a long
brass twelve-pounder, which is not altogether hidden by the boat, you know, and might have
given rise to a little curiosity, or maybe suspicion, even in the mind of a girl, as to our
character, pursuits, and so forth, which I should have been puzzled to answer. Therefore I
chose a clear starlight night to pay my homage, and accordingly I went below about four bells
of the first watch to escort the little lady to the deck. She was dressed, and waiting for
me in the cabin; and if I was so struck with her beauty when I first saw her, my heart thumped
now against my ribs like a volley of musket-balls against an oak plank. She wore a black silk
robe, such as Spanish women wear at early mass, and around the back part of her head--where
the hair was gathered in a glossy knot, and secured by a gold bodkin--fell the heavy folds
of a black lace mantilla, the lower end fastened sash fashion around her lithe waist. She stepped,
too, like a queen on a pair of slim, long, delicate feet, with arched ball and instep, as if
she were in command of the schooner.

"By my right arm!" exclaimed Captain Brand, shaking that member aloft in a glorious fit of
enthusiasm, "I am quite sure she had conquered me, and that was more than half the battle!

"Well, I led her to the quarter-deck, where some cushions and flags had been placed for her
near the weather taffrail, and where she sat down. The schooner was at the time under the two
gaff-top-sails, the main boom and sheets eased off a little, those long masts, with the sticks
above them running clear away up the sky, almost out of sight, bending like whalebone, and
reeling over the long swell when the breeze freshened; and not a sound to be heard save now
and then a light creak from the main boom as the broad white sail strained flat and taut over
to leeward, or the rush of the water as it came hissing along from her sharp, clean bows, with
a noise like a breeze through the leaves of a forest, away off over the counter into luminous
sparkles as it swished out into our wake. The 'Centipede' was indeed doing her best, and you
all know what that is, when we have been chased many and many a time by some of the fastest
cruisers going.

"You remember, Don Ignaçio, how the 'Juno' frigate nearly ran us under, and yet never gained
a fathom on us in nine hours?"

"Ay, amigo; but, had she not carried away her fore-top-mast, in another hour there would have
been nothing left of you afloat but a--hencoop perhaps."

"Quien sabe, compadre? If hads had been shads you would have had fish for your breakfast,"
rejoined the narrator; and then throwing back the lappels of his green velvet coat with an
air of gentlemanly satisfaction, he hooked his thumbs in the arm-holes of his fine waistcoat,
and went on.

"Well, señores, the graceful girl beside me never spoke scarcely for half an hour. I divined,
however, what her thoughts might have been in dwelling on the painful scenes she had recently
witnessed, and I held my peace also; for, you see, I have had considerable experience with
women, and I have ever found that a man loses more by talking than by remaining watchful and
attentive."

Captain Brand looked, as he gave utterance to this philosophical sentiment, as if he were a
thirsty, cold-eyed tiger, lying in wait to spring upon an unwary passer-by.

"Yes, I waited, until at last she spoke.

"'Capitano,' she said, 'what a beautiful vessel you command, and how fast she sails!'

"What I replied, my friends, is neither here nor there; but I sank down on the cushions beside
the lovely girl, and poured out a torrent of passionate words--which I really felt, too, at
the time--as I don't think I ever uttered before or since. She was a little startled and nervous
at first, but after a while I saw her stately head droop to one side till it rested on my shoulder;
I stole my arm around her yielding waist and clasped her to my breast."

Here Captain Brand looked as if the tiger had already sprung upon the passer-by, and was sucking
the blood, with his claws buried deep into the carcass.

"'Señor,' she murmured, in the low, sweet, plaintive note of a nightingale, 'I am a young and
inexperienced girl, of an old and noble family; you have saved my life; my mother is gone,
and I have no one to advise with, and, if my dear father smiles upon my choice, I will marry
you; but do not, I implore you, deceive me!'"

"And you did not deceive her, I hope?" broke in the doctor, with a shiver of light from his
determined eyes that was almost painful to see, so earnest and terrible it was, as he leaned
forward with both of his clenched hands quivering nervously on the table.

Captain Brand looked at the doctor with rather a suspicious stare, and letting his thumbs drop
from his armpits till they rested on the flaps of his waistcoat pockets, he replied, in a careless
tone,

"Oh no, monsieur, I never deceived--a--that is to say, intentionally deceived a woman in all
my life!"

"Let us hear more, my son," said the priest, thickly, who had now woke up from a short nap.

"Bueno, caballeros!" continued the narrator, as he tossed off a thimbleful of maraschino from
a wicker-bound square bottle after his coffee. "Well, gentlemen, the young Portuguese damsel,
Señorita Lucia, and I sat there under the weather rail till the first faint streaks of early
dawn in the tropics began to announce the coming of the gray morning. Then she arose, and,
leaning with a soft pressure on my arm, I took her to her cabin, kissed her sweet hands, and
bade her good-night."

At this stage of the narrative Captain Brand threw himself triumphantly back in his large Manilla
chair, and ran his white muscular hands through his dry light hair. Ay! the tiger had clutched
his prey. An unprotected, young, and lovely girl had been won and lost, and her palpitating
heart was soon to be torn from her tender body.

CHAPTER XVI.

NUPTIALS OF THE GIRL WITH DARK EYES.

    "With a pint and a quarter of holy water
      He made the sacred sign,
    And he dashed the whole on the only daughter
      Of old Plantagenet's line!"

The captain got up from his chair, stepped to the settee, and, pulling the signal-cord on the
wall, held a short dialogue with the man at the station; then, saying in a low, sharp whisper
through the tube, "A bright look-out, Pedro!" he resumed his place at the table. The doctor
had, in the mean while, got up and gone to the veranda, where, swinging in a Yucatan grass
hammock, shielded from the night wind, lay his little patient sleeping soundly. Carefully closing
the curtains again around him, he returned to his place. The padre was now all awake again,
with his thick lips open, waiting for the captain to go on with his story. As for Don Ignaçio,
he never stirred body or limb, but his eye traveled about perpetually, and he observed the
movements of his companions all at the same time. Still the hoarse roar of the pirates in their
carouse arose from the covered sheds in the calm night, and the two solitary lights from each
mast-head of the felucca and schooner twinkled above the basin of the inlet.

"And now, amigos," began again Captain Brand, after he had assured himself that all was going
on as he could wish without, "I shall inform you of the sequel of my adventure with the Señorita
Lucia. The evening after the night on which I had declared my passion, we were seated at dinner
in the after cabin. Such a choice little dinner, too, as only our late friend, Lascar Joe,
could prepare! Poor fellow, he'll never make another of those famous curries, though, no doubt,
he'll find fire and pepper enough where he is, if the devil chooses to employ him. What a neat
hand he was, too, with that spiral-bladed Malay creese of his! Ah! well--we were sitting over
the dessert, and I was relating to my pretty passenger some account of my early days, and of
my lady mother and my old squire of a father, omitting, perhaps, some few uninteresting details--"

Here the old commander of the felucca cackled, and his black, beady eye glittered as the thought
flashed through his head as to what details his villainous compeer had omitted. How he forged
his old father's name, which brought down his gray hairs in sorrow and disgrace to the grave;
and how his poor mother, too, died of grief, together with other bitter memories, all of which
Captain Brand, the pirate, omitted to mention.

"Yes, I related likewise some of my early privateering adventures, when all the broad Atlantic
was alive with the fleets of France, England, and Spain; how I was captured by a Spanish brigantine"--omitting
again to state that he got up a mutiny with the crew of that brigantine, poniarded the captain
and mate in their sleep, and, assuming command of the vessel, changed her colors for a black
flag, and began his career as a pirate in the Caribbean Sea--"and how I escaped. To all this
she listened with great interest, her large eyes dilating, and her bosom swelling with sympathy
as I proceeded, when suddenly the cabin door opened, and my ugly friend Pedillo put his head
in, and gave me a warning nod.

"'What is it?' I said, rather sharply, to Pedillo; 'and how dare you intrude inside my cabin?'
I fear, too, that I came very near doing a mischief to my boatswain; for I am rather impulsive
at times, and by the merest accident I happened to have a small pistol in my pocket."

Don Ignaçio twitched his sleeve, and looked as if he believed such accidents as pistols being
found in the narrator's pockets happened quite often.

"'Señor,' said Pedillo, 'there are two sail standing out from the lee of Culebra Island, and
one of them appears to be a large--'

"I stopped any farther particulars from the lips of my subordinate by a motion of my finger,
and then, kissing the hands of the girl, who was somewhat surprised at what had transpired,
I left the cabin and jumped on deck.

"The schooner was now running down through the Virgin's Passage between St. Thomas and Porto
Rico, with a fine breeze on the quarter, and the sun was just sinking behind the last-named
island. I snatched a spy-glass from the rail, and looked ahead. There, sure enough, was a sixteen-gun
brig on the starboard tack heading across our track, and a large frigate under single-reefed
top-sails stretching away over to the opposite shores of Culebra, while they were telegraphing
bunting one with another as fast as the bright-colored flags could talk. And, as luck would
have it, as I swept the glass round, what should I see but a long rakish corvette in company
with a huge whale of a line-of-battle ship, with her double tier of ports glimmering away in
the slanting rays of the sun, both on the wind, and coming out from under the lee of Culebra
Point, just a mile or two astern of us. By the blood of Barabbas, caballeros, we were in a
trap for wolves, and the hounds were in full cry! I immediately, however, luffed the schooner
up, and steered boldly for the frigate; and, as a puff of smoke spouted out from the lee bow
of the admiral to windward, and before the boom of the gun's report reached us, I hoisted American
colors. Seeing this, the brig hove in stays, and, perhaps being ordered to board me, came staggering
along on the other tack across our forefoot, while the frigate went round too, and held her
wind toward her consorts to windward. Now this was just the disposition which I wanted of the
vessels, and it could not have been done better for my plans had I been the admiral of the
squadron. In less than a quarter of an hour, the brig--and no great things she was, with a
contemptible battery, as I could see, of short carronades--hove aback a little on the bow of
the schooner, and gave us a warning of a twenty-four pound shot across our forefoot, to heave
to also, at the same time hoisting the English ensign.

"So ho!" ejaculated Captain Brand, as he twisted the point of his nose, accompanied by a malevolent
scowl, "señores, I at once hauled flat aft the fore-sail, dropped the main peak, and put the
helm up, as if to round to under the brig's stern; whereupon my man-of-war friend dropped a
cutter into the water, and she had just shoved off in readiness to board me, when, before you
could light a paper cigar, I ran up the main peak, got a pull of the sheets, and the 'Centipede'
was off again like a shark with his fin above water, heading for the narrow passage between
Culebra and Crab Islands. It was at least five minutes before that stupid brig could believe
his eyes, and ten more before he got hold of the boat again, when she filled away and began
to pop gun after gun at me as fast as he could bring his battery to bear! There was only one
shot that skipped on board us, and that only smashed both legs of a negro, and then hopped
off through the fore-sail to windward.

"Had I not had a good dinner that day and pleasant society on board"--how peculiarly the speaker
smiled--"I should perhaps have taught that brig such a lesson that he would not have cared
to report it to his admiral. But as I knew I had the heels of him, and as the rest of the squadron
were now crowding all sail and keeping off in chase of me, I ordered Pedillo, just by way of
touching my hat and saying 'Adios,' to clear away the long gun and return the brig's salute.
The shot struck him just forward the night-heads by the bowsprit, and by the way the splinters
flew and his jib and head-sails came down, I knew I had crippled him for an hour at least.
At the same time, to prevent any mistakes as to our quality, and to satisfy the admiral's curiosity,
we hauled down the Yankee colors and set our swallow-tailed flag!"

"Rather dark bunting! no?" edged in Don Ignaçio.

"Ay, amigo! as black as that eye of thine, though not half so murderous," retorted the pirate
as he continued his narrative.

"Bueno, there came the whole of the squadron down after us, spitting out from their bridle
ports mouthfuls of cold iron, which all went to the bottom of the Virgin's Passage, for not
one came within a mile of the schooner; and then I led them such a dance through that intricate
cluster of reefs and islets, that soon after dark they gave up the game, and I said 'Buenos
noches' to them all!"

Here Captain Brand paused, made a careful selection of a beautifully turned trabuco cigar from
the box, shouted to Babette to produce some old Santa Cruz rum, sugar, lemons, and hot water--screeching
hot, he said--at which the padre crossed himself; and then throwing his fine legs, incased
in the lustrous silk stockings, on a chair beside him, and while his eyes gazed fondly on the
brilliants sparkling in the buckles of his shoes, he resumed his tale.

"When I went below again, after every thing had become quiet on deck, I found my stag-eyed
sweetheart waiting to receive me! How superbly she looked as she made a movement from the cushions
where she had been reclining, and exclaimed,

"'Oh, señor, what has happened, and what was the cause of all that noise of guns, and those
cries of agony I heard above?'

"'Querida Lucia, dearest,' I replied, 'we have been where there are--a--pirates, but fortunately
have escaped, and the cries you heard were from one of my poor crew who got slightly wounded
by a shot!'

"'Ah, malditos piratos! cursed pirates!' exclaimed the charming beauty, as she put both her
hands in mine, 'and how thankful am I that you are not hurt! But, querido mio! dear one!' she
went on, 'when shall we get to Porto Rico and our dear father? We must be near, for I heard
one of your sailors shout to you the name of the island!'

"In reply, I told her that we had been near Porto Rico, but that--a--circumstances were such,
on account of the dangerous pirates who infested those seas, that I felt obliged, for her safety--you
understand--to run along by way of Hispaniola--she not having a very clear idea of the position
and geography of those parts--and that our cruise might probably be prolonged for a few days more."

"And into h----, perhaps," said the doctor, with a hollow voice and a calm cold eye.

"Oh no, my friends, certainly nothing so bad as that. Possibly to heaven! but, quien sabe?
no one can tell!

"However," pursued the captain, "I soon succeeded in allaying her apprehensions, and then I
threw myself at her feet, and implored her to risk her father's displeasure and to marry me
at once; that she knew her father was cold, stern, and obdurate, and should he frown upon my
suit I should die of despair!"

"Cierto!" murmured Ignaçio, with the grin of a skeleton.

"I used these passionate appeals and many more, until at last the fond girl yielded her consent
to my entreaties.

"'But the priest, querido mio!' she exclaimed, as she rose and disengaged herself from my arms.
I told her that I chanced to have one on board as a passenger, who would perform the ceremony.

"And so I had," added Captain Brand, "or at least a very near approach to one, for my ugly
boatswain, Pedillo, had been bred up--as an acolyte--you comprehend--in the house of a rich
old prelate of San Paulo Cathedral in Trinidad, to whom Pedillo, one fine morning, gave about
eight inches of his cuchillo!"

"Jesus Maria!" exclaimed Padre Ricardo, starting back with horror, and telling his beads.

"Ay, mi padre! Pedillo assassinated the holy father, and plundered his cash-box besides; and
so you see Pedillo was just the man I wanted."

Don Ignaçio nodded his wicked old head through a cloud of cigar smoke as a sign of approval.

"Accordingly, señores, the next day I made the trusty Pedillo cut off all the bushy beard about
his ugly face, and had the crown of his head shaved besides--quite like that round, oily spot
there on the top of good Ricardo's poll--and then he rigged himself out in a clerical gown,
to which the trunks of my bride's old mother contributed, and, take my word for it, he was
as proper and rascally a looking priest as could be found on the island of Cuba. He performed
the ceremony, too, by way of practice, on Lascar Joe and the second cook beforehand, with as
much decorum and solemnity, and gave as pious a benediction, as his old Trinidad uncle, the
prelate, ever did. Well, that evening we were married."

"How many times has the capitano been married?" grunted out Don Ignaçio.

"Why, let me reflect," as he threw his cold, icy look at the frame of miniatures on the opposite
wall. "You mean, compadre, how often the ceremony has been performed. Ah! I think on eleven
occasions. No, it was only ten. Madame Mathilde had two husbands living when I made love to
her, and declined to take a third. But then, you know, I have an affectionate disposition,
and I can not set my heart against the fascinations of the sex."

He gave vent to these moral sentiments as if he really meant them to be believed and generally
adopted by his audience.

"Well, that same evening I was married to the beautiful Señorita Lucia Lavarona, though I am
sorry to say that Pedillo did not perform his part of the business as well as I had expected
of him, from his practice in the morning. He stammered a good deal, and when he raised the
crucifix to the lips of the young girl, her innocent looks and maidenly majesty of deportment
so struck my coadjutor with confusion that he let the crucifix fall to the deck at her dainty
feet. This little incident caused me some displeasure; but, reflecting that the poet tells us

    'A tiger, 'tis said, will turn and flee
    From a maid in the pride of her purity,'

I said nothing to the abashed Pedillo as I gave him back the emblem; but I favored him with
a look, with my right hand in my pocket--this fashion."

Here the cold-blooded scoundrel dipped his thumb and fore finger into the flap of his waistcoat,
while the commander of the "Guarda Costa" waved his brown digit before him, as if he knew what
was there all the time.

"Ah! that restored my new-made priest to his senses, and he then got through the ceremony entirely
to my satisfaction.

"However," said Captain Brand, turning with lazy indifference toward Padre Ricardo, "ever after
this I resolved not to take the risk of such another chance of failure, and this is the reason
why I first sought your services."

"Gracias à Dios! Thanks be to heaven, my son, that you found me!" said the sacrilegious wretch,
as he bowed to his superior and sipped a glass of rum punch. "Vamonos! let us hear more."

"At the conclusion of our nuptials, while I held my sweet Lucia to my heart, and kissed her
pale brow, and while tears of crystal drops, half in rapture and half in sorrow, dimmed her
large, sparkling black eyes, she withdrew this royal sapphire from her slender finger, and
gently placing the gem on mine--where you see it, amigos--she said,

"'My dear and only love, this is the talisman of my race. It has been for ages in my family,
and it has been the guardian of our hope and honor. Receive it, friend of my heart, and be
the protector of the young girl who yielded up to you her very soul!'"

The doctor started as if he had been stung by a scorpion; but Captain Brand, heedless or inattentive
to the movement, went on:

"Yes, caballeros, those were her very words; murmured, too, in her low contralto tones with
a pure, lisping Castilian accent, as she laid her stately head on my shoulder.

"Ay, those were rapturous moments; and it was in some degree--yes, I may say in truth--entirely
her own fault that they did not last.

"Well, for some days--eight or ten, perhaps--with light baffling winds, we crept stealthily
along the south side of St. Domingo; but the weather was delightful, and the time passed on
the wings of a zephyr. In the warm, soft evenings, with the moon or stars shedding their pearly
gleams over the sea, she sat beside me on the deck of the schooner, watching with girlish interest
the white sails above her head, or singing to me the sweet little sequidillas of her native
land. And again, starting up from my arms, she would peep over the counter, trace the foam
as it flashed and bubbled in our wake, or point to the track of a dolphin as he leaped above
the luminous waves and went like a bullet to windward.

"I flatter myself, caballeros, that there have been periods in my career on the high seas,
or on land, and may be again, for aught I know," continued the elegant pirate, as he crossed
his legs and threw back the lappels of his velvet coat, so as to expose the magnificence of
his waistcoat, and the frills on his broad, muscular chest, "when men of high birth and breeding,
and lovely women too of noble lineage, have not thought it beneath them to dine with or to
receive the homage of--a--Captain Brand.

"And, por Dios!"--the narrator did not consider it unbecoming his cloth and profession to swear
in a foreign language--"por Dios! señores, I have known the time, too, when I have played whist
with a French prince of the blood and two knights of the Golden Fleece."

"And you fleeced them? No?" muttered Don Ignaçio, with an envious glimmer from his greedy eye,
as if no one had a right to rob the community but himself.

"And not only that," continued the captain, rapidly, "but the daughter of an English peer of
the realm once proposed to run away with me. Ho! ho! yes, she actually proposed to elope with
me; but as she was verging on fifty years, and only weighed fifty pounds, with never a pound
in her pocket, I sighed my regrets. Ay, great compliment it was, but I declined the honor.
You yourself, compadre, must remember how I was received by the people on the Buena Vista villa
at Principe; how the obispo blessed me, the old general embraced me, and the beautiful marquesa,
with the hour-glass waist, smiled on me."

"Cierto!" That astute old Spaniard never forgot any thing, particularly a debt due to him;
and he remembered, moreover, to have heard that when the noble Mi Lord Inglez left the villa
one dark night, a good deal of plate, jewels, doubloons, and other valuable property disappeared
with him. Ay, the sly old fellow had a faint recollection as well of seeing a heavily-armed
schooner running the gauntlet through the forts before daylight, and that she left a certain
bag of gold ounces for him--Don Ignaçio Sanchez--somewhere in a secret hole beneath a well-known
rock inside the harbor. Oh, a wonderful memory for matters of this nature had our rapacious
one-eyed acquaintance!

"Yes," went on his partner in many a scene of pillage and crime, "I have every reason to know
that I won the hearts, and purses too, sometimes, of some of the fine people I met in refined
society. But yet there have been occasions when the game has gone against me--"

Don Ignaçio's tenacious memory came again into play, and he looked back to the time when he
himself had cleaned his profuse friend out of all his gains at the card-table, even to the
buttons off his coat; but he gave no sign of remembrance of those days, and only blew a dense
cloud of smoke from his thin yellow nostrils as the captain spoke.

"--Though those occasions have not been of frequent recurrence."

The good Padre Ricardo at this juncture hoped that, by Saint Barnabas, luck might, in all time
to come, befriend his son and patron; croaking, too, with a goblet of punch to his unctuous
lips, "Vamonos! Tell us more of the adorable Doña Lucia!"

Captain Brand rapped his snuff-box, opened the diamond-crusted lid, took a dainty pinch, laid
his cambric handkerchief over his kerseymere breeches, and resumed his narrative.

"So passed the days, caballeros; and when, one morning, the high mountains back of Port Guantamano
were reported to me, I felt a presentiment that my dream of bliss was drawing to a close. Indeed,
I might probably have remained at sea a week or two longer, but the men were getting a little
impatient, and I thought it better to sacrifice my own pleasure to theirs. That day we caught
a cracking breeze out of the Windward Passage, and toward midnight we came up with this little
sandy island here.

"The preparations for going into port excited the curiosity of my bride; for, poor thing! she
believed we were bound into Porto Rico, and I had some trouble in inducing her to go below
before we crossed the reef. Bueno! the coast was clear, the signals were all right, and an
hour later the schooner had her anchor down and sails furled pretty much in the spot where
she now lies moored.

"While, however, we were sweeping up the inlet, I sent a boat ahead, with directions for my
tidy old housekeeper, Babette, to have every thing prepared to receive her new mistress. Just
then one of those terrible thunder-storms came up; heavy masses of clouds obscured the sky,
followed by such double-barrel shocks and intensely vivid lightning as is only beheld in the
tropics preceding the equinox. The rain, too, came along in horizontal sheets, driven by a
squall which burst in fury over the island, and it seemed to me that all the devils from hell
were howling and shrieking in the air.

"Shielded from the storm by a large boat-cloak, I carried my beautiful bride, with her face
nestling on my breast, to the cove, and then I bore her into this fine saloon.

"I shall never forget the sweet words she whispered, and the loving caresses she gave me on
that little journey, even while the tempest almost dashed me to the ground, and the sharp flashes
of lightning nearly blinded me. They were the last she ever lavished upon me."

No sigh escaped the lips of this cold-blooded monster as he uttered these words; no sign of
feeling for the ruin of a gentle girl whom he had betrayed to his piratical den of infamy and
crime--whose dream of life was destroyed like a crushed rose-leaf, and all her hope gone from
that moment.

CHAPTER XVII.

DOOM OF DOÑA LUCIA.

      "I went into the storm,
    And mocked the billows of the tossing sea;
    I said to Fate, What wilt thou do to me?
      I have not harmed a worm!

      "Thy dim eyes tell a tale--
    A piteous tale of vigils; and the trace
    Of bitter tears is on thy beauteous face;
      Beauteous, and yet so pale!"

"Thus it ever is, caballeros, and ever will be," went on Captain Brand, in rather a reflecting
strain. "There is a point to begin and stop, and an end to joy as well as grief. We should,
however, take the world as it comes and as it goes. I do, and so do you, compadre!"--pitching
a cigar spear fashion at Don Ignaçio to attract his attention--"and, therefore, we should never
look too far ahead, and live only for the present.

"Indulging then in this train of thought, as I set down my lovely burden here, and the cloak
fell from her shoulders, I was prepared for any thing which might happen. I wore a slightly
different costume at the time than that she had been accustomed to see me in, as I always do
when I think there might be a chance of a surprise or trap laid for us in entering the inlet.
So, instead of fine linen and velvet, I had on a red flannel shirt, canvas trowsers, with a
cutlass slung to my side, and a pair of pistols in my belt. I don't think I appear handsome
in that rig, but the fellows at my back somehow think it is becoming to me, especially when
we are engaged in a hand-to-hand fight! What say you, compadre?"

The Don said nothing, and merely waved his fore finger, as if dress was not a matter to which
he devoted much attention. He thought, however, that sleeves should be cut loose for knives
when the pockets were not too small for pistols; but he uttered no word.

"Bueno! There I stood"--pointing to the corner of the room as he spoke--"drenched with rain,
and there stood my tall and lovely wife!

"The saloon was brilliantly lighted; a profusion of plants and flowers were clustered here,
there, and every where, on cabinets and tables, in striking contrast to the display exhibited
yonder in that armory, where pikes, muskets, and knives were gleaming through the open door.

"Quick as the lightning which was piercing deep into the inmost crevices of the rocks and lighting
up the crag without, Lucia's dark eyes flashed around the apartment from floor to ceiling,
from flower to blade, resting an instant on the frame of miniatures there--hers was not among
the collection then; it is the one in the middle, doctor--"

There were no knives on the table, or else, from the deadly look the doctor gave, he might
have perhaps sprinkled the narrator's heart's blood on the floor.

"--Until at last her gaze of terror rested on me! No one, I fancy, can tell the power of Spanish
girls, who has never seen them when the whole passion of their souls, either in love or hate,
comes pouring in a black blaze of jet from their gleaming eyes.

"Advancing a step toward me, with her white hands clasped together, she said, in a hurried,
beseeching voice--and low as was the sound, I heard it distinctly during the crashing thunder
which shook the rocks of the crag to their foundations--

"'Señor! where am I? My father! Who--who--in the name of the Blessed Virgin, art thou?'

"Again giving a look of the utmost horror around the room, she pressed her hands to her eyes,
and said, in the same low, distinct tone,

"'Speak, señor! For the love of our holy Savior, speak!'

"I felt that the girl had saved me, by her own instinctive perception, a world of painful explanations,
and I replied,

"'Lucia! I divine that all farther concealments are useless; you are in the haunt of the most
noted pirate of these seas, and that man stands before you.'

"Caballeros!" continued Captain Brand, "had my pretty prize swooned away, or fallen down in
a fit, or gone into hysterics and torn her hair out by the roots, I should not have been greatly
surprised; but she did none of those things. On the contrary, she became as calm as marble--frightfully
so, in fact--and pushing back the bands of her magnificent tresses from her pale forehead,
she raised her round white arm aloft, with her slender fore finger quivering like the tongue
of a viper in mid air, and then poured forth such a torrent of awfully impressive words that
I quailed before her.

"Yes, señores, I am no coward, take me when you will; but on this occasion I must honestly
admit that I stood powerless before the gaze and gesture of that slight, delicately-formed woman.

"'Pirate--wretch--monster! may the curses of hell be heaped upon thee! Murderer--betrayer!
may thy heart be burned, and thy soul blasted forever!'

"I need not pain you, señores, by reciting the cruel words that came hissing through her closed
teeth, nor yet farther describe the terrible concentrated gaze of hate and fury which streamed
from those gleaming eyes. Suffice it to say, that though often afterward I was treated in the
same manner, yet, on the occasion alluded to, I cut short the interview by summoning Babette
to see her mistress to her chamber, and then, glad to escape, I went out of the house and attended
to the duties which required my presence."

The padre, with his flat lips half open, eagerly drinking in--with his Santa Cruz punch--the
words of his patron; the doctor, calm, unmoved now, and thoughtful; the one-eyed old rascal,
still puffing his cigarettes and allowing no rest to his uneasy, suspicious optic, all sat
listening, with each an interest peculiarly his own, to the fate of Doña Lucia. The narrator
leisurely arose and held his hourly confab with the man at the signal-station, and then returning
to his place, proceeded with his discourse:

"I shall pass rapidly over, my friends, many little incidents of a rather unpleasant nature
which occurred here, in this my rocky retreat, for some months after the interview which I
have described. I tried every argument and persuasion I was master of to bring my proud bride
to reason, but to all my entreaties she turned a cold and chilling stare of obdurate hate.
Day by day the intensity of her detestation grew stronger and stronger, and seemed to have
become a part of her nature. Yes; the gentle, yielding girl I had won on board the 'Centipede'
had now become as stern and unbending as a rock, and my controlling power over her mind and
love was gone. I left her entirely to herself for some weeks, until one day I thought her passion
might have subsided, and once more, attired in a rich and splendid suit, I came in here, as
she sat like a marble statue at table. She never looked up at my entrance, but her eyes shone
like stars as she mechanically went through the forms of the dinner laid before her.

"'Lucia!' I said, gayly. No answer by word or look. 'Lucia! querida mia!' I repeated, and,
sinking on one knee beside her, attempted to take her hand.

"By all the saints, señores, that came near--very near--being the last time that I ever should
kneel to a woman; for with a movement so sudden that I had barely time to leap aside, she snatched
a long pointed carving-knife from the table and lunged full at my throat! The blade just grazed
my jugular artery, inflicting a slight wound. But she never turned round to see the extent
of her effort, and again sat calm and rigid at the table.

"This was my last visit save one. I had long before abandoned these comfortable quarters entirely,
and occupied the rooms you do, mi padre, out there among the men. In fact, my stern young bride
was in entire command of the island; and even my good Babette here stood in such awe of her
that she always crossed herself when called to approach her mistress.

"Month by month matters went on in this way, until the rainy season had gone, and I was preparing
for another cruise in the schooner; but hour by hour the consuming passion which flamed in
the veins of Lucia was doing its work. I sometimes beheld her standing out on the veranda,
tall and stately as ever; and when the moon was at the full, it threw its light upon her wan
and sunken cheeks, and thin, wasted frame. Ay, there she stood, like an almost transparent
statue of alabaster, with her dark eyes shining with an unearthly light, turned in one long
tearless gaze upon the ledge and combing breakers to seaward. It was singular, too, the effect
she produced even upon the horde of these brave fellows of mine, for no persuasion could induce
a man of them to come within pistol-shot of that part of the house while she was thus keeping
her nightly vigils. And as for Pedillo, he acquired such a superstitious dread of the girl
he had married, and lived in such a state of abject terror, that I had serious thoughts of
shooting him through the head to avoid the contaminating influence he exercised over his comrades.

"Well, caballeros, late one Saturday night, while the men were carousing and drinking success
to the coming cruise--we were to sail on the following Monday--and while I was returning from
my usual stroll to the Tiger's Trap to see the battery in order and the look-outs wide awake,
I met Babette toddling along, nearly out of breath.

"'What is it, old lady?' You know, amigos, that Babette never spoke a word in her life, but
she made signs to let me know that I was wanted at the crag, and that there was no time to
be lost. I quickened my pace, and, preceded by Babette, I once more darkened my own threshold.
The curtains and hangings were all closely drawn in the saloon here, and it was dark as a tomb;
but there was a light burning yonder in the passage leading to the chamber, and I made my way
to the door.

"I shall never forget what I saw, though I should like to, as it comes to me sometimes in the
night, or when I am left much alone by myself."

The pirate passed his hands over his eyes as if he saw something while he spoke, and then,
letting his voice drop to an almost sepulchral pitch, he went on hurriedly:

"I stood at the door, caballeros, and looked in. On the bed, which was drawn to the middle
of the chamber to get the air through the narrow loopholed windows, with the gauze curtains
falling square on all sides, lay Lucia. Her attenuated frame scarcely presented an uneven surface
beneath the snowy sheet which covered it. Her superb hair was spread in great black masses
on the pillow, and her pale marble face reposed there like an ivory picture in an ebony setting.
Her eyes were wide open, large and luminous, and her thin delicate hands were clasped around
a silver and pearl crucifix, which rested on her hollow breast. A single taper in a silver
lamp threw a lurid, flickering ray about the room, and beside it was Babette on her knees quivering
with terror, while from one of the loopholed windows a broad white band of moonlight streamed
directly across the pillow and face of the dying girl."

Captain Brand's face assumed a deathly pallor, and, with his icy blue eyes fixed on vacancy,
and his voice sunk to a hoarse whisper, he went on:

"As I appeared in the portals of the door, Lucia slowly raised her fore finger, and beckoned
me to approach. I could no more have resisted the summons than if a chain cable to a frigate's
anchor had caught me in its iron coils, and was dragging me to the bottom of the sea. I moved
to the foot of the bed.

"'Pirato!' came from her slightly-parted lips, in her old low and distinct tones. 'Pirato,
behold your cruel work! Destroyer of mother and child--of soul and body--may the curses of
a dying woman and her unborn child haunt you by day and by night!' I was dumb, and my pulse
stopped beating.

"'Ave Maria purissima!' were the last words that came in a sweet, pure whisper from her parted
lips; she clasped the crucifix tighter, and the spirit departed. I tore aside the gauze net
to lay my hand on her heart, when, on my soul! her right hand slowly relaxed its death-grasp
on the crucifix, and, rising to a vertical line, with the fore finger pointing upward, quivered
in the light of the waning moon, like, as it was, a supernatural warning! Yes, that finger--"

"Mamma! mamma!" came in a weak, plaintive voice from the piazza, while the villain, with his
hands before him as if to shut out a frightful vision, and eyeballs starting from their sockets,
was hoarsely whispering to his horror-stricken audience the last warning of the dead Lucia.

As the low moaning cry in the stillness which reigned around the saloon struck his ear, he
sprang with a bound to his feet, and, quick as thought, with a pistol in each hand, he shouted,
"Who's there?"

"It is the little sick boy, señor. Do him no harm at your peril!" and the doctor stood towering
before the pirate's leveled weapons.

"Maldito on the brat! Pshaw!" said Captain Brand, quieting down, and returning the pistols
to his pockets. "How nervous I am! Excuse me, caballeros. I was thinking of something else."

CHAPTER XVIII.

END OF THE BANQUET.

    "There was turning of keys, and creaking of locks,
    As he stalked away with his iron box.
    Oh, ho! oh, ho! The cock doth crow,
    It is time for the fisher to rise and go.
    Fair luck to the abbot, fair luck to the shrine!
    He hath gnawed in twain my choicest line;
    Let him swim to the north, let him swim to the south,
    The pirate will carry my hook in his mouth."

In the pause which followed the dreadful episode just recounted by Captain Brand, the padre
was occupied in pattering a prayer, counting his beads, and elevating his crucifix as if he
was mumbling high mass at the altar. Don Ignaçio slowly waved his brown fore finger, and his
single spark of glowing eye glared fiercely and fixedly at his host. A clammy sweat burst out
on the pallid brow of the doctor, and his hands were clutched before him on the table like
the jaws of a steel vice. And still the drunken shrieks and cheers of the piratical crew at
the sheds arose wild and shrill in the calm night, making a gloomy echo for the banquet. The
doctor was the first to break the awkward silence which pervaded the saloon.

"Capitano!" said he, in his habitual calm, deep voice, "with respect to what you said in the
early part of the evening, of breaking up this establishment, what, may I ask, are your plans
for the future?"

"Gracias! amigo doctor! Thank you, my friend, for changing the conversation. My plans! eh!
ah! Well, they are these--"

Here Captain Brand's face assumed its usual expression; and entirely himself again, he went
on to state, in a precise, business-like way, the views he had resolved upon for future action.

"--To-morrow, gentlemen, is Sunday. Those boisterous fellows out there, after mass, will need
rest all the day. On Monday, however, I shall begin to change the rig of the schooner, fill
up with provisions for a long cruise, take on board all the loose odds and ends we have stowed
here, of course," he added, as he remarked an inquiring and a rather alarmed mercenary look
from the Tuerto's glim--"of course, after having squared up all claims of our compadre there!"

"Hum!" croaked that sharp rascal, with a nod of satisfaction quite like an old raven.

"Then, señores, I shall burn or destroy the old sheds, and bury the cannon and heavy articles
we can not find room for in the 'Centipede;' when, if nothing happens, we shall trip anchor
and spread our sails for sea!

"Babette! Babette! Really I believe that dear old negress has fallen asleep. Babette! ah! there
you are, my beauty! See if you can't give us a bowl of okra gumbo before we break up here!"

Babette had not been asleep. Oh no! She had her ear to the door of the saloon, and was listening
to the sad history of Doña Lucia, and when her master came to the final scene the old woman
fell on her knees and shivered all over, where she remained until the sound of the captain's
voice again called her to her duties.

"And when we have left these quiet waters, my son!" broke in the padre, "what then?"

The fact was, that the carnivorous and vinous Father Ricardo knew that his stomach was not
suited for high winds and rough oceans, and was hoping that some scheme might be devised to
allow him to remain tranquilly on the island.

"Why, holy padre, I propose to steer clear of the West Indies by some unfrequented track, and,
striking the broad Atlantic, stretch down the coast of Brazil. Perhaps we may double Cape Horn,
and see what those miserable patriots are fighting for in Chili and Peru; then maybe across
the Pacific, to the lovely islands and maidens of Polynesia; so on to the China Seas, where
we may fall in with an outward-bound Canton trader, or a galleon with a ton or two of silver
on board--who knows?--there is plenty of blue water and fine ships every where; so we must
be content."

Padre Ricardo made the sign of the cross, kissed his thumb and fore finger, and, reaching his
dirty paw over to the captain, shook hands with him.

"Ay, amigos!" continued the leader, without minding the friendly interruption; "yes, my friends,
we shall, I trust, give the hounds in search of us the slip; and even should they scent out
this retired little spot, they will have their trouble for their chase, and find nothing but
a few stones and heaps of rubbish above ground."

"They may find some little matters below, though," chimed in the commander of the felucca.

"If they do," retorted the pirate, with a meaning scowl, "I'll put the spy who betrays it to
such a torture as that he'll wish himself below ground when I come back here."

"Cierto, amigo! no fear of that!" muttered the Tuerto, with some little trepidation of manner.
"My papers are white."

"Captain Brand," said the doctor, "my contract with you is nearly up, and since I only agreed--as
you know--to enlist my professional services here on shore, I presume you will have no objections
to permit me to depart with Don Ignaçio in the felucca."

It would be difficult to say what caused the flush of passion which overspread the leader's
face as he listened to this simple request, but it was full a minute before he replied, and
then, having weighed the matter carefully in his mind, he said, in a precise and determined
tone, in French,

"Monsieur le Docteur! the compacts that I have made with all those that have taken service
with me have never been broken except by death. I can not, therefore, consider your request,
and I shall expect you to sail with me in the schooner."

Then he added, quickly, as he noticed a certain haughty expression in his subordinate's face,
"Pardon me, monsieur; we had better not discuss this question now. Suppose you see me on the
morrow."

"Willingly, señor, and you will find my resolution unchangeable." Rising as he spoke, he bowed
to his companions at table, and saying "Buenas noches! (good-night!)" he passed from the saloon
to the piazza. There he paused a moment, as if communing with himself, and then approaching
the grass hammock where the sick boy was sleeping, he gently took the little fellow up in his
arms. The child murmured "Mamma, mamma!" and was borne away.

Captain Brand followed the doctor with his searching, sharklike eyes until he had left the
apartment, and there was something that denoted danger in the look; but he uttered no sound,
and, placing a finger on his lip, he nodded meaningly to the padre.

A moment after Babette brought in the steaming gumbo soup, and the pirate's feast was nearly
ended. Don Ignaçio waited until his companions had swallowed a goodly portion of the grateful
mess, when he too refreshed himself. Then making his salutations in his usual observant manner,
he departed. He declined, however, the offer of his host's society to his boat, saying he had,
he knew, half a dozen of the felucca's crew outside the building to guard his footsteps, and
he would not put the capitano to the trouble.

When the padre rose to give his benediction to his patron, the captain took him impressively
by the rope which girded his cassock about the loins, and giving it a sharp jerk or two, he said,

"My holy father, I think we shall have a sad duty to perform to-morrow. Our old friend Gibbs
has behaved badly, and I shall punish him. He is now in the Capella dungeon. After early mass
go and console him."

The padre returned a meaning smile, crossed himself, and slowly left the pirate alone in his
saloon.

CHAPTER XIX.

FANDANGO ON ONE LEG.

    "God! 'tis a fearsome thing to see
    That pale wan man's mute agony--
    Those pinioned arms, those hands that ne'er
    Shall be lifted again--not even in prayer!
    That heaving chest! Enough; 'tis done!
    The bolt has fallen! the spirit is gone."

Day dawned in the east. The early spikes of morning shot up in rosy bands from behind the lofty
hills of Cuba and announced the coming of the sun. The inlet and basin, framed in by their
rocky walls, were still clothed in the gloom of night, and dimly reflecting the fading stars
on the calm unruffled surface where the schooner and felucca were moored. Away off in the distance
a dense white misty vapor hung flat and low over the lagoon and thickets of mangroves, with
not a breath of air to disturb the noxious fog or quiver a leaf in the silent groves. The revels,
too, of the drunken sailors had long since ceased; the sentinels, with their cutlasses in the
sheaths, paced slowly to and fro before the doors of the sheds, and the look-outs at the signal-stations
and battery peered through the early dawn to seaward; else not a sound or moving thing, save
a teal or two fluttering with a sharp cry up and down the lagoon; the music of the tiny ripples
lapping on the shelly beach; and the low roar, in a deep bass, breaking and moaning over the
ledge beyond the island. Such was the appearance of things where our scene is laid in the Twelve
League Group of Keys, on a Sunday morning, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and five.

Half a mile, perhaps, inland from the sheds where the sailors lived, and beneath the steep
face of the ridge-like crag which split the island in two parts, stood a low chapel, built
of loose stones nicely fitted together and roofed with tiles. A rough iron cross was fastened
over the doorless entrance, and at the other end was a stone balustrade, with a rude painting
of the Virgin over the altar, on which stood four or five tall brass candlesticks and a lighted
taper. Outside the building was a narrow and secluded inclosure, surrounded by a low wall of
coral rocks, with a few head-stones marked with black crosses--the graves of the pirates whose
bones reposed beneath. At one end of this burial-place was still another subdivision, where
stood ten upright flat white stones, on whose faces were rudely carved initial letters, with
the years in which the eternal sleepers had been laid beneath the sand. Far and near sprang
up close and almost impenetrable thickets of cactus, whose sharp and pointed needle-shoots
defied the passage of any thing more bulky than land-crabs and lizards. One or two narrow pathways
had been cut out here and there, but they were overgrown again by the stubborn, hardy vegetation;
and only with the risk of losing one's trowsers, and having one's legs cut in gashes, could
a human being struggle through it.

Within the chapel kneeled a dozen or more of the "Centipede's" crew, the coarse and sodden
faces and uncombed locks, from their night's debauch, in striking contrast to the place and
the apparent devoutness of manner in which they crossed themselves while the rites of the Church
were going on. Before the altar stood Padre Ricardo, with his breviary on the chancel beneath
the taper, and chanting forth from his deep lungs the services of the mass. In a few minutes
the unholy hands and lips which performed the solemn ceremony ceased word and gesture, and
with a sonorous benediction at the elevation of the Host, and a tinkle of a bell, the sailors
arose from their knees and again staggered back to the sheds, to slumber through the day. When
all had gone, the padre clasped his missal, tucked it into his bosom, and making the sign of
the cross with a genuflexion before the Virgin, the sacrilegious wretch turned and left the chapel.

Pursuing the winding path which led to his own habitation for a certain distance, he then turned
to the left, and carefully picking his way through the sharp cactus and Spanish bayonets along
the face of the crag, he stopped at a yawning fissure which gaped open in the rock. Here, too,
the same wiry vegetation had crept, and it was with great difficulty, and many an "Ave!" and
"Santa Maria!" that the padre succeeded in passing into the dark, rugged mouth of the cavern.

"By the ashes of San Lorenzo!" he muttered, "there are serpents and venomous insects in this
pit of purgatory. Oh, misericordia! what has pierced my leg? Why should my son drag me through
this hole? Ah! blessed Saint Barnabas! a slimy reptile has crossed my instep!"

Feeling with his outspread hands in his fright, as he gradually made his way into the dripping
cavern, getting narrower and lower as he proceeded, he at last, after stumbling prayerfully
along for about a hundred and fifty yards, came to a loose pile of stones. Here opened another
low narrow fissure on the left, and, in some doubt, he was about to enter; but the noise he
made by stepping on a stone was answered by the hissing warning of a serpent, and the scared
padre fell back at his full length in a pool of stagnant slimy water.

"O Madre di Dios! I am stung by a cobra! Holy Virgin! my new cassock ruined too! Ave Maria!
light me out of this abode of the devil!"

Slowly recovering, however, from his fright, he once more regained his feet, and, after a few
steps, which he was obliged to accomplish by scraping his crown against the jagged rocks above,
his outstretched hands touched an iron-bound door.

"Gracias à Dios! Thanks be to all the saints, I am here at last; but, alas! curses on me, I
shall be obliged to return by the same path unless my son allows me to escape by the casa."

Cautiously searching with his fingers as he muttered these words, he touched a bolt, and, grasping
it with both hands, drew it partly out like the knob of a bell. Then, placing his ear to the
door, he presently heard a rattling, creaking noise, as if a beam of timber, with pulley and
chain, was being raised from behind the entrance. When the sound ceased the door yielded to
the padre's sturdy shoulder, and there was just room to admit his portly body. Here the passage
was wider, the rock evidently chiseled away by the hands of man, and on one side was an artificial
chamber, blasted out of the solid rock, with a narrow door with heavy iron bolts on the outside.
At this opening the padre paused and listened. No sound caught his ear at first, but as he
clutched the bolt and it grated back in its bands, he was saluted by such a volley of frightful
curses as to make him start back and cross his ample breast. It was the voice of Master Gibbs,
lying there on a low iron settle in the noisome dungeon, with not a ray of light to cheer him,
and only a jug of water and some weevily biscuit to save him from starvation. All through the
day and during the long, long hours of the awful night, in pain and suffering from his lopped-off
limb and bruises, had he lain on his hard bed with clenched hands, blaspheming and impotently
raging in his agony and despair. No prayer, however, dawned in his ruthless heart, or was breathed
from his brutal lips; but curses upon curses came thick and fast, till his tongue refused to
give them utterance, and he fell back in utter exhaustion. As the noise, however, of the bolt
struck his ear, he clutched the stone water-jug from the floor, and hurled it, with a yell
of execrations, toward the door, where the fragments fell with a clattering crash on the stone
pavement.

Grinding his teeth in his frightful passion, he howled,

"Let me but once put these hands on your bloodstained carcass, and if the mother that bore
ye will know her spawn again, my name's not Bill Gibbs! Ha! you miserable swab, with your soft
words and white hands! when I get out of this hole I'll blow you and your infarnal hounds to
----! Give me fair play, and, even on one of my legs, I'll cut the cowardly heart out of you,
Captain Brand! Come in, will ye? ye son of the devil, and I'll bite the tongue out of your
mouth by the roots!"

 Here the hoarse and panting wretch again ceased his roarings, and
the padre timidly opened the door.

"Ha! who's that? Babette?"

"No, my son, it is your good Padre Ricardo, come to console you."

What the maimed villain replied to the priest, and what means the holy father took to allay
the passion and assuage the sorrows of the man lying helpless in the dungeon, or whether successful
in his mission, is not important to state in detail. An hour later, however, the priest seemed
relieved in body and spirit as he retired from the loathsome hole, and shooting the bolt as
he closed the door, cautiously felt his way along the dark and narrow passage. Presently, as
he turned an angle, a ray of light from the loopholes of the great stone vault beneath the
pirate's dwelling lighted his pathway; and a moment after, with a hearty sigh of satisfaction,
he seized a cord above his head and gave it a jerk. A bell sounded above, and then a large,
square-hinged trap-hatch fell down, swinging gently to and fro from the beams above. At the
same time the padre put his arms about a square wooden stanchion which supported the floor
of the saloon, and then painfully sticking his toes in some deep-cut notches at the sides,
he slowly began to mount upward. When, however, his oily shaved crown appeared nearly at the
level of the floor, a vigorous grasp was laid on his shoulders, and he was pulled up like a
flapping lobster and rolled into the apartment. It was Captain Brand who kindly assisted the
holy father, and it was the captain's hollow laugh which saluted him in his torn and soiled
raiment, as, with difficulty, he regained his perpendicular.

"Laugh not, hijo mio, at my sorrowful plight," said the bruised Ricardo, with some asperity;
"I have met with dangers of venomous serpents, and been stabbed cruelly by those villainous
cactus."

"But I raised the beam, my padre, the moment you made the signal."

"You did, my son; but what I suffered in the cavern was as nothing to what I endured when I
entered the dungeon of the English Gibbs. Jesus Maria, what an infidel he is!"

"You did not find his spirit subdued, then, by bread and water?"

"Far from it, my friend. He rages like a wild beast. He consigns your body and soul to everlasting
torments! But, what is more impious still," went on the padre, as he crossed himself, "he damned
your holy father, and hoped I would roast in hell!"

"But he confessed, Ricardo, and you gave him absolution?"

"If calling me thief and assassin, and hurling his stone water-jug at my head, be confession
and forgiveness of sins, the ceremony has been performed. Ah! my son, he needs no more mercy
in this world!"

"Of course not, my padre; and we will give him a short shrift and a long rope."

"Babette!" continued Captain Brand. "Ah! my Baba, you have not forgotten to feed our jolly
Gibbs there below? No? I thought not. Well, then, it is Sunday, you know; give him a pint of
pure rum for his morning's draught. And, Baba, my beauty, slip a pair of iron ruffles over
his wrists, and then pass a cloth over those bloodshot eyes of his, and lug him here beneath
this hatch. Go down by your own ladder, and be quick, my Baba, as I wish my breakfast presently!"

All this was said in a cool and rather an affectionate tone, as Captain Brand sipped a spoonful
or two of chocolate from a cup of Dresden china. Then turning to the padre, he said,

"You would perhaps like a cordial, my father, to take the chill off your stomach? Yes. You
will find some capital Curaçoa in that stand of bottles there."

The padre, forgetful of the dignity of his calling, shuffled with indecent haste to the spot
indicated, and, without going through the form of filling one of the diminutive thimble-shaped
glasses in the stand, he boldly raised the silver-netted flask to his lips, and sucked away
until it was nearly empty. Then seating himself on the settee, he lugged out his illuminated
missal and pored over its contents. Captain Brand occupied himself with opening the loop of
the silk rope which fell from the ceiling, and securing the end firmly on the stout cleat at
the wall.

So passed the time until a noise beneath the room of a voice in anger, and a body bumped and
dragged along, once more attracted the attention of those in the saloon.

"Oh ho! is that you, Master Gibbs?" exclaimed Captain Brand, in a cheerful voice. "You have
risen early; but stop that profane language, my friend, or you will never see daylight again!"

The maimed ruffian only muttered, "Your friend, eh? blindfolded and manacled!" And then, apparently
abashed by the cool, commanding tone of his superior, he held his peace.

"Well, you are quiet, my lad. Now we'll see if we can't hoist you up here in the saloon."

"Thank ye, sir!" said Gibbs, aloud; and then he muttered to himself, "Let me jest get one grip
of ye, and I'll show ye how quiet I'll be."

"Do you think we shall need assistance, my son?" whispered the padre into the ear of his patron.

"Diavolo! No. I never wanted help in these little affairs, except in the case of that violent
Yankee whaler, who gave us much trouble, you know, and we were obliged to call Pedillo," replied
the captain, in the same low tone. Then, raising his voice, he said,

"Hark ye, Master Gibbs! Babette will lift you off the stones, and the padre and I will raise
you up to the room here. You don't weigh so much as you did before you had your leg hacked
off with a hand-saw--ho! and I dare say you are as light now as a dried stockfish! Up with
him, Baba! There--steady! all right--here you are!"

Saying this, Captain Brand, with the assistance of the stout negress and the padre, raised
the once burly ruffian, with a vigorous hoist that made him groan, to the floor of the saloon,
where they laid him out at full length on his back.

"Wait a moment, my hearty, till the hatch is raised, and then we will raise you. Unpleasant
position, no doubt," continued Captain Brand, as the trap came up and was secured by a spring;
"but then, you know, you would have that pin of yours cut off, and somehow you have been so
careless as to dispose of the nice leg you had the other day, made out of the spruce fore-top-mast
of the 'Centipede'--a very tough bit of a spar it was."

Here Master Gibbs grated his teeth and grinned hideously.

The captain smiled like a demon, and, approaching the prostrate cripple, said cheerfully--ay,
in a frank and hearty tone--

"Now, my padre, place a comfortable chair for Master Gibbs, and we will help him to a seat."

The considerate Ricardo placed a large, roomy Manilla chair on the fatal trap, and then aided
his chief in lifting their victim to the position assigned him. As they performed this operation,
the captain, with the gentleness of a tiger before he strikes his prey, and with a wink to
the padre, lightly passed the noose of the silk rope over the ruffian's hairy throat, where
it lay like a snake with its slack coil squirming at the back of the chair.

"Now, Master Gibbs, I am about to remove this bandage from your beautiful red eyes," said Captain
Brand, in his cold, chilling, deliberate manner, "and if you so much as move when daylight
shines before you, I'll blow your brains out."

Here the pirate leisurely cocked a pistol close to his subordinate's ear, removed the bandage,
and laid the weapon on the table within reach.

"No noise either, Master Gibbs!" continued Captain Brand, as he stirred up the remains of his
chocolate and gulped it down; "for it is Sunday morning, and we must respect the feelings of
our padre. You were unkind to him, he tells me, just now, and even said some disrespectful
things of me. What have I done to vex you?"

The manacled wretch tried to raise his horny hands to his face when the cloth was removed from
his eyes, and rub those organs, while he glared suspiciously around; but the captain pointed
with his white finger in a threatening way to the cocked pistol, and Master Gibbs let his hands
fall again.

"Well, Captain Brand, I s'pose now you're going to treat me as a faithful man who has sarved
under you ought to be treated; and I'm willin' to forgive what has passed."

There was no look of forgiveness, however, in those brutal bloodshot eyes, nor much signs of
repentance in those grinding teeth and compressed lips.

"Why, no, my Gibbs, I am not going to treat you as a faithful man, but I tell you what I will
do"--here the captain moved his chair nearer till his straw slipper touched the spring of the
trap--"I will drink a glass of grog with you in forgetfulness of the past and forgiveness for
the future."

"Thank ye, Captain Brand; I do feel dry. That stuff Babette gave me a while ago didn't touch
the right spot, and I'll be glad to jine you."

"Ah! bueno, my old friend; you shall drink something that will touch the right spot! What shall
it be? you have only to name it."

"I'll take a toss of that old brandy you gave me the other day, if it's the same to you, sir."

"Oh, Master Gibbs, it's all the same to me. Delighted I am to oblige you! Padre mio! a glass
of old Cognac for our friend--a tumblerful; a wine-glass will do for me."

The padre poured out the brandy as he was desired, handed the lesser glass to the captain,
and the tumbler he placed in the locked hands of the victim. Slowly and painfully the subdued
ruffian raised the glass to his mouth, careful not to spill a drop; then, before draining it,
he cleared his throat, while at the same time the captain rose to his feet, his right foot
resting a little on the heel, and held the wine-glass before him.

"Now, then, Master Gibbs, for a toss that will touch the right spot."

"Ay, ay, captain!" said Gibbs; "and here's forgiveness for the future."

Scarcely had the words been uttered, and the liquor began to gurgle down the hairy throat of
the manacled wretch, than the pirate before him pressed his foot with a quick, nervous action
on the spring.

Like a flash the trap fell, carrying chair and man with it. The hinges of the hatch creaked,
the wicker-work chair fell with a bound on the stone floor below, the heavy beam overhead gave
a jarring quiver as the strong silk rope brought up with a shuddering surge on the cleat where
it was belayed at the wall, and with a gasping, choking cry of pain mingled with the ring of
the shattered tumbler on the pavement, the ruffian of a hundred crimes fell full three feet,
and hung struggling in the death agony. With almost superhuman force he raised his clenched
hands and struck his forehead till the manacles were twisted like wire by the effort, spinning
around too by the lopsided weight of his body, while the beam above yielded slightly to the
strain, and the deadly cord, no longer squirming, but taut as a bar of iron, held the wretch
in its knotted embrace, clasped tight around the throat. In a minute or two the hands ceased
beating the inflamed face and head, and fell with a clank before the body; the legs gave a
few convulsive twitches, a last and violent spasm shook the frame, and there Master Gibbs hung,
a warm dead lump of clay.

While this murderous business was going on, and the poor crippled wretch was struggling in
the jaws of death, the padre was chanting with his profane tongue from his open breviary the
Salve Domine, and his patron coolly took down a telescope and swept it over the blue water
to seaward. When, however, after a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and the body of their victim
gave no more signs of life, the captain laid down the telescope as the padre closed his missal,
and remarked quietly, while glancing critically down at the suspended body,

"He did not go off so easy as I had anticipated; his bull-neck is not broken, though the knot
was perfectly well placed. However, he is stone dead, and we will lower him down. You, my padre,
will bury him!"

"Hijo mio! son of mine! spare me that troublesome duty. Would you have me drag such a carcass
through the cavern and consign him to consecrated earth, when he refused the last holy offers
of salvation?"

"Bueno, my padre, I respect your feelings! You need not put him under the sand; take him merely
to his late dungeon, and lay him decently on his bed."

"Thank you, my son; your orders shall be obeyed!"

Glad, apparently, to be relieved from farther exertion, though with manifest symptoms of disgust,
the priest, more infamous even than the scoundrel he had assisted in hanging, clumsily descended
the hatchway by the way he came up, and awaited the movements of his chief. The captain stepped
to the wall, and, casting off the turns from the cleat, he slowly lowered the body down till
it rested on the pavement.

"Unbend the rope from his neck, my padre, and hitch it on to that Manilla chair. There--all
right! you may return this way and breakfast with me."

Saying this, Captain Brand rounded up the chair, detached the silk rope, hung the loop in its
accustomed place, and then waited the reappearance of his confederate. Not many minutes elapsed
before the padre, having performed the last rites, again ascended the stanchion, and was assisted
above the floor by his chief. Then both together got hold of a ring-bolt in the trap, drew
it up and secured the spring, placing square bits of mahogany over the countersunk apertures,
so as to prevent accidental falls or hangings of themselves. Even while performing these mechanical
operations, the priest puffed out an account of his proceedings below: how he had dragged the
body to the dungeon; how, when there, he had inadvertently stumbled and fallen on the top of
it; and that his lips--maldito!--came in contact with the open mouth of the late Master Gibbs;
but when he had recovered from the horror of this frightful caress, he had said a short prayer
and bolted the door.

"You have done well, my padre; and now let us break our fast. Babette, a couple of broiled
snappers and a cold duck! Be lively, old lady, for I have business to attend to after breakfast.
Hola, mi padre, will you wash your hands in water before sitting down? No! bueno! I will myself
take a dip all over."

No, the oily Ricardo never washed his hands, save wetting the tips of his fingers in holy water
in the chapel; and, indeed, he rarely touched water in any quantity either outside or in; and
it was with a look of surprise, not unmingled with contempt, that he beheld his patron retire
for a bath.

CHAPTER XX.

BUSINESS.

The business which Captain Brand alluded to when he was about to partake of breakfast with
his friend the padre was, in the first instance, to arrange some matters in the way of payment
of debts to his compadre, Don Ignaçio Sanchez, commander of the Colonial Guarda Costa felucca
"Panchita."

Accordingly, when he rose from table, and after a whispered dialogue and reports as to the
state of affairs in and around the den and island from the men at the signal-stations, he summoned
Pedillo. When that worthy appeared below the veranda--for be it remembered that Captain Brand
never permitted the inferior officials of his band to pollute his apartments, unless, perhaps,
as in the case of his deceased subordinate, Master Gibbs, it was on urgent business--Captain
Brand ordered his gig manned.

Pedillo threw up his hand in token of assent, and walked down to the brink of the basin to
execute the command. Then, after a few minutes, Captain Brand lit a cigar, dismissed the padre,
put on his fine white Panama straw hat, unlocked a strong cabinet with a secret drawer, glanced
over a paper before him, and, making a rapid calculation, he caught up a heavy bag of doubloons,
and left the house in charge of Babette. The captain always told his guests that his fellows
had such love and respect for him that he rarely locked up his property, and never placed a
guard at his door. The truth was, that his fellows--scoundrels, miscreants, and villains as
they were--stood in such fear and dread of their leader, that they were glad to keep out of
his way. Moreover, he never boasted or made any display before them, living on shipboard, as
on shore, by himself, but always ready and terrible when the moment came for action; treating
his crew, too, with the most rigid impartiality, adhering strictly to his promises and compacts
with them, and never overlooking an offense.

So Captain Brand left his dwelling in charge of his dumb housekeeper Babette, and tripping
down the rope ladder from the piazza in a clean suit of brown linen and straw slippers, his
beardless face shaded by his broad-brimmed hat from the sun, and the bag of gold on his arm,
he jauntily walked toward the cove.

"Ah! good morning, my doctor! Glad to meet you! How are the sick? Doing well, I hope!"

"Quite well, sir; but I was about to call upon you in relation to the conversation we had last
evening, and--"

"Pardon me, Monsieur le Docteur, but I have been very busy this morning, and am now going to
see Don Ignaçio on matters of importance"--here the elegant pirate took the cigar from his
thin lips and held it daintily between his thumb and fore finger in the air--"and really, monsieur,
I am very sorry to miss your visit. But," he added, with one of his usual smiles, "I shall
be at leisure this afternoon, and in the cool of the evening we can take a stroll. What say you?"

The doctor nodded.

"Apropos, docteur, suppose we have a little game of monté afterward at your quarters. I never
permit gaming in mine, you know. The padre will not object; and I am confident our compadre,
the Tuerto, will be delighted."

"As you please, captain," replied the medico, with a cold, indifferent air and averted face.
"I will join you in the promenade, and I shall be ready to receive you in the evening."

"Hasta huego, amigo!" said Captain Brand, as he again stuck his cigar between his teeth, waved
his hand in adieu, and walked to his boat.

"You don't love me, doctor," thought the pirate. "I don't fear you, captain," thought the doctor.

It was a touch of high art the way this notorious pirate pitched the bag of gold toward his
coxswain, crying, "Catch that, Pedillo!" and then the almost girlish manner in which he pattered
about the beach and held up his trowsers, so that he might not even get his slippers damp.
Had that salt water been red blood, he would not have cared if his feet had been soaked in
it. And then, too, the little exclamation of joy when he finally stepped into the stern-sheets,
and sat down beneath the awning, while he stretched his smooth brown linen legs out on the
cushions. Oh, it was certainly a touch of high piratical art!

"The old 'Centipede' is looking a little rusty after her late cruise, Pedillo!" throwing his
head back to evade a curl of smoke, and casting his cold eyes like a rattle of icy hail at
the coxswain. "But I am glad Pedro took your place"--puff, puff--"that knife-stab prevented
you, of course"--puff--"and we shall have her all tight and trig again in a day or two."

"Si, señor!" said Pedillo, respectfully; "and how goes Señor Gibbs, capitano?"

The capitano rolled his icy eyes again at the coxswain, and replied, carelessly, "Why, Pedillo,
our friend Gibbs came to see me when the 'Centipede' anchored, but almost before"--puff--"he
had given me an account of his unfortunate cruise he fell down in a fit. The fact is, however"--puff,
puff--"that, what with hard drinking and inflammation which set in on the stump of his lost
leg, he has been in a very bad way"--puff--"quite in a dangerous condition indeed, requiring
all my old Babette's care and attention"--puff--"but this morning the good padre went to see
him, and he told me a while ago that he left him without fever, and altogether tranquil."

Pedillo's wiry mustaches twirled of themselves.

Meanwhile the boat skimmed lightly over the basin, and as the captain ceased speaking she ran
alongside of the felucca. Don Ignaçio, with his bright single eye in full burning power, and
a cigarette between his wrinkled lips, was on the deck of the vessel to receive his visitor;
and as he saw the coxswain follow his superior with a weighty bag under his arm, his glimmering
orb became brighter, if possible--as if it was piercing through the thick canvas of the bag,
and counting, ounce by ounce, the contents--and putting out his fore finger, it was grasped
cordially by the white hand of Captain Brand.

"Como se va? How goes it with my compadre? Stomach and head all clear after our long dinner
of yesterday?"

The compadre said that his head was particularly clear that morning, and as for his stomach
he had not yet inquired; but if the capitano had any doubts as to the former proposition, he
had better step below and decide for himself.

In accordance with this ambiguous invitation, the visitor and commander disappeared down the
small cuddy in the afterpart of the felucca, where was a low, stifling hole of a cabin, dank
with stale tobacco-smoke, and smelling awfully of rats and roaches. There was a little round
table in the middle, and on one side was a single berth, with some dirty bedding, which had
not been cleaned, apparently, since the vessel was built. Light was shed from a skylight above.

Captain Brand gave a sniff of disgust as he entered this floating sanctum of Don Ignaçio, but,
without remark, seated himself on a canvas stool, and waved a perfumed cambric kerchief before
his nose.

Commander Sanchez, catching the inspiration, merely observed that it was a little close certainly,
and not so spacious as the superb cabin of the schooner, and that sometimes, when lying in
a calm off the lee side of Cuba, it was hot enough to melt the tail off a brass monkey; but
yet it was his duty, and he did not particularly mind it.

Hereupon Captain Brand requested Don Ignaçio to produce his papers, and they were presently
laid upon the table. For a few minutes the pirate was absorbed in running his cold eyes over
the accounts--making pencil-notes on the margins, and comparing them with a memorandum he took
from his pocket; but at last he threw himself back and exclaimed,

"Compadre, the account of old Moreno, at the Havana, is correct to a real--three hundred and
twelve doubloons and eight hard dollars. Yours, however, has some few inaccuracies--double
commissions charged here and there; all losses and sales charged to me, and all profits credited
to you."

Don Ignaçio spread out the palms of both his hands toward his companion, as if to exorcise
such unjust charges from the brain of his confederate.

"O si, si, compadre! it is as I state, and you know it is true; but, nevertheless, a few dozens
of ounces more or less makes no difference; and, to make short work, I am ready to pay. But,"
said Captain Brand, laying a hand on the heavy bag of money beside him, "though I am quite
ready to cancel my debts in hard cash here on the spot, yet, as I am bound on a long cruise--Heaven
only knows where--I would prefer to keep the gold and pay you in something else."

Don Ignaçio threw his head back and fixed his eye like a parrot on the captain, waiting to
hear farther.

"What have I on hand besides gold? Well, there are a few bales of Mexican cochineal, and English
broadcloths, and some cases of French silks, which you can have at a fair market value; then
there is all that collection of silver table-service, which you can take by weight; and, besides,
lots of rare furniture, which you may set your own price upon--altogether much more than enough
to pay Moreno and you both. What say you, compadre? is it a bargain? or shall I carry the stuff
with me, and run the chance of disposing of it on the Spanish Main?"

It was a long time before the crafty old Spaniard could make up his mind whether to receive
his pay in a simple portable currency, or take more bulky matter, with the hope of making double
the money by the operation. Finally, however, his greed overcame his prudence, and he accepted
the last proposition, with the understanding that the articles should be transferred to the
felucca the next night.

"Ah!" said Captain Brand, with another sniff of disgust, as he spat on the dirty floor of the
cabin, "I am glad the affair is settled, for I wouldn't remain another hour in this filthy
hole for all the money you have cheated me out of, you old rascal."

He said the last portion of this sentence to himself as he emerged from the cuddy.

"But listen, amigo!" he continued, as they both reached the deck. "You will give me duplicate
receipts on the part of Señor Moreno, so that I can forward one to him from the next port I
visit. And, by the way, suppose you come on shore this afternoon for a stroll, and in the evening
we will have a little game of monté--eh?"

"Cierto! (certainly!)" returned the commander of the felucca; when Captain Brand, with his
bag of gold intact under his arm, got into his boat and was pulled to the shore.

CHAPTER XXI.

TREASURE.

It was long past noon when the pirate returned to his island home, and the day was hot, for
the sea-breeze had not made, and the tropical sun was pouring down its burning rays until the
sand was roasting as in a furnace; the very rocks throwing off a trembling mirage of heated
air, and the lagoon almost boiling under the fiery influence. The sailors, with aching heads
and parched mouths, were swinging in their grass hammocks beneath the sheds; and, save the
watchful vigilance of the men at the look-outs and battery, the little island was wrapped in
repose.

Captain Brand, however, was as cool as a cucumber; and regardless of the heat, and indifferent
about siesta, he drew the curtains of the saloon, and took some active exercise. First, however,
he desired his faithful Babette to get out some camphor trunks and pack the contents of his
splendid wardrobe. This operation was performed under the critical eye of Captain Brand himself,
to which he personally lent his aid by stowing away, here and there, his caskets, trinkets,
and treasures--those which had been presented to him by the unfortunate people who had the
ill luck to make his acquaintance on the high seas, or in midnight forays on shore. Then the
captain opened and rummaged cabinets, bureaus, and bookcases, making liberal presents to his
trusty housekeeper; and, turning from that occupation, he had all his table furniture spread
before him, when he made careful estimates of the value of the silver, china, and glass. This
concluded, Captain Brand ordered Babette to furnish him a slight repast; and while it was preparing--the
captain taking the precaution to bolt his handmaiden in her kitchen--he went quietly into his
bedroom, and when he came out he bore heavy burdens in his muscular arms, all of which he laid
conveniently near the trap in the floor. Then letting the hatch swing softly down, he lowered
the heavy articles by the silk rope, as he had Master Gibbs, though not so suddenly, going
down himself as nimbly as a rat after them. In the vault beneath, Captain Brand struck a light
and set fire to a torch, which blazed out luridly, and illumined the dark excavation and passages
like day. Going slowly on, with his burden in his arms, by the path by which we traced the
padre, he came to the outer door, which opened into the fissure in the crag; and, after a vigorous
effort, the beam was raised, and he passed out. Once outside, he felt his way cautiously, stepping
clear of the stagnant pools beneath, and guarding his head from the jagged rocks above; and
then, lighting his way over the stones which had upset the equilibrium of Don Ricardo, he crept
slowly into an aperture on the right.

No serpents or venomous reptiles disturbed the pirate's progress; for, though there were plenty
of them coiled or crawling near, yet their instinct probably taught them that he was a monster
with a more deadly poison than themselves, and whose fangs were sharper, though his tongue
did not hiss a note of warning. Captain Brand put down his burden and crept forward on hands
and knees, the blazing torch lighting up the damp and dripping rocks, all green and slimy from
the tracks of the snake and lizard. Where the narrow fissure seemed to end by a wall of natural
rock, the pirate rolled aside a large stone at the base, and scratching away the sand, a large
copper lock was displayed, in which, after pushing aside the hasp, Captain Brand touched a
spring, and it opened. Then, exerting all the force of his powerful frame, a rough slab of
unhewn rock yielded to the effort, and rose like a vertical door slung by a massive hinge at
the top. Placing the large stone at the opening, so as to prevent the slab falling to its place,
the captain stood the torch within the opening, and went back for his burden; then he returned,
and squeezed himself with it into a small excavated, uneven chamber, where he sat down.

"Nasty work," communed the pirate with himself, "but a safe place to lay up a penny for a rainy
day! Let me see. These two bags of doubloons, and the small one my Gibbs brought me, with those
three, there, of guineas, and those sacks of dollars, will make about ten thousand pounds.
That will make me a nest-egg when I retire from the profession and return to Scotland. They
will have forgotten all my boyish follies by that time."

Captain Brand alluded to forging his father's name, and other little peccadilloes of a similar
nature.

"And I may be elected to Parliament--who knows? It is something of a risk, perhaps, to leave
all this pretty coin here, but then it's a greater risk to carry it in the schooner"--he argued
both ways--"and then, again, damp does not decay pure metal. But," thought Captain Brand, "suppose
somebody should discover this little casket in the rock. Ah! that's not probable, for no soul
besides myself knows of it, and even the very man who made the door did not know for what it
was intended; besides, he died long ago."

Captain Brand had forgotten, in this connection, that the man who cut out the stone chamber
and door, and fashioned the hinge and lock, took too much sugar in his coffee the morning the
job was finished, and died in horrible convulsions before night. Oh yes, that incident had
entirely escaped his memory!

Captain Brand, having now thoroughly reasoned the matter out, gave each of the bags lying on
the sand a gentle kick to get a responsive echo from the coin; and then creeping out of the
treasure-chamber, he withdrew the torch, removed the stone, and the heavy slab fell again into
its place. Then clasping the lock, covering it over with sand, and rolling back the stone,
he seized the torch and quickly returned to the vault beneath his saloon. There, putting out
the torch by rubbing it against the stone pavement until not a spark was left, by the sunlight,
streaming through the loopholes around, he passed to one side and began removing the cases
of cochineal, silks, and what not, near to the strongly-barred portcullis door, which opened
toward the basin fronting his dwelling. It was hard work, but Captain Brand seemed to enjoy
it; and even after he had arranged the packages intended for shipment in his compadre's felucca,
he began again. Going to the farther corner of the vault, he stopped before a strong mahogany
door, and taking a key from his pocket, unlocked and threw it wide open. It was as black as
night inside, floored and lined with wood, and emitting a choking atmosphere of charcoal and
sulphur. Piled around the walls were some fifty or a hundred small barrels with copper hoops,
and branded on the heads with the word "powder." Unmindful of the odor and the rather combustible
material around him, Captain Brand again resumed his work, and rolled a large number of the
little barrels toward the doorway, near the merchandise already there, saying to himself the while,

"I think that will about fill the 'Centipede's' magazine, and we must make a proper disposition
of the remainder."

Hereupon Captain Brand, actively bent upon the work of disposing of his treasures, rolled out
a dozen or two more of the little barrels. Strange to say, among the very few articles that
were never presented to him, but actually bought of Señor Moreno, was this highly useful and
indispensable material of powder, and he therefore set much store by it. And it was with a
sigh of regret that the pirate stood the little barrels on their ends in a line across the
great vault of the building, beneath kitchen, bedrooms, and saloon, and especially beside the
square upright stanchions on which the interior of the building rested. Not content with this,
he took a copper hammer and knocked in all the heads of the little barrels, and then, with
a scoop of the same metal, he dipped out large quantities of the black material, and poured
thick trains of it from barrel to barrel, sometimes capsizing one, but always particularly
cautious not to rasp a grain of it beneath his grass slippers and the pavement. Then he took
a piece of match-rope, and sticking one end deep into a barrel, he just poked the other end
out of a loophole, to be in readiness whenever Captain Brand should deem proper to touch his
lighted cigar to it.

"There," said Captain Brand, "that piece of tow will burn about thirty or forty minutes, and
then--stand from under!"

Ascending the hatchway again with the agility of a cat, he drew up and secured the trap, and
in ten minutes afterward he was freshly attired in a nice pair of India panjammers, a grass
cloth jacket and vest--with, of course, the usual knickknacks in his pockets--and seated at
table, where his busy housekeeper had placed a broiled chicken and a bottle of old Bordeaux
before him.

CHAPTER XXII.

PLEASURE.

    "But ever, from that hour, 'tis said,
      He stammered and he stuttered,
    As if an axe went through his head
      With every word he uttered.
    He stuttered o'er blessing, he stuttered o'er ban,
      He stuttered, drunk or dry;
    And none but he and the fisherman
      Could tell the reason why."

"Babette," said Captain Brand, as he tapped a spoon against his coffee-cup and puffed his cigar,
while the stout dumb negress was removing the remains of the light dinner, "Babette, old girl,
you know that we are going to leave here in a few days, and I should like to know whether you
care to go with us or remain here on the island."

The negress made a guttural grunt of assent, and nodded her head till the ends of her Madras
turban fluttered.

"Ho! you do, eh? Well, my Baba, I shall be sorry to leave you, for you will be very lonely
here, and it may be a long, very long time before I come back."

Babette jerked her chin up this time, and did not grunt.

"It's all the same, eh? old lady! Well, I shall leave enough to eat to last you a lifetime;
but you will have to change your quarters, my Baba, and live in the padre's shed, for I--a--don't
think this house will be inhabitable long after I am gone."

The negress gave another grunt and nod of assent.

"Yes. Well, old lady, the matter is decided, then; but, in case you should have any visitors
here after we have gone, you won't take any trouble to describe what you have seen here? No!
That shake of your head convinces me--not if they roast you alive?"

The hideous sign of understanding that the woman expressed in her dumb way would have convinced
any body without the trouble of uttering a word.

"Bueno!" said Captain Brand; "that will do for to-day."

Rising as he spoke, he stepped to a cabinet, slipped a large handful of doubloons in his trowsers
pocket, put on his hat, and walked out.

The sea-breeze swept over the island with its full strength, making the lofty cocoa-nuts bow
their tufted tops, the palm-trees rustle their broad flat leaves and clash the stems together.
The mangroves bent, too, before the wind, and the sand eddied up in tiny whirls amid the great
expanse of cactus, while the vessels swung with taut cables to their anchors. Even Captain
Brand's hat nearly was blown off his dry light hair as he joined his compadre, Don Ignaçio,
at the landing; and the sandy dust blinded--though only for a moment--that one-eyed individual's
optic, and put out his cigarette as they struggled against the influence of the breeze. But
yet they walked on in the direction of the sheds, and as they passed through the court-yard,
where the men were lounging about in yawning groups or sitting under the piazza, playing cards--getting
up and touching their hats as their chief passed--Señor Pedillo accosted him thus:

"Capitano, the people are thirsty, and desire a barrel of wine."

"Not a drop, Señor Pedillo--not so much as would wet the bill of a musquito! To-morrow at daylight
let all hands be called, for we have work to do, and we must be quick to do it."

Pedillo slunk away, abashed by the positive tone of his commander; and Captain Brand, with
his companion, passed on to the domicile of the padre and doctor. Pausing at the open door
of the shed, they looked in. The padre was lying flat on his back on his narrow bed, with his
mouth wide open, and snoring like a key-bugle with leaky stops; while his beads and crucifix--misplaced
emblems in contact with drunkenness and debauchery--were reposing on his ample chest. The doctor
was sitting beside his own couch, whispering words of childish comfort to the little boy, whose
pale cheeks and brown curls reposed on the pillow of the bed. The poor child's thin, limp fingers
rested like the petals of a drooping lily in the dark, bony hand of his friend, and his dim
hazel eyes were turned sadly toward him.

"Holloa, amigos!" shouted Captain Brand, in a hearty voice. "We are losing the glorious sea-breeze.
Vamanos! let us take a stroll to the Tiger's Trap."

Hereupon Captain Brand entered the room, and gave the padre a violent tweak of the nose, at
the same time puffing a volume of cigar-smoke into his beastly mouth, which combined effort
brought the holy father to life in a trice, choking and sputtering, as he arose, a jargon of
paternosters, which an indifferent hearer might have mistaken for a volley of execrations,
so savagely were they uttered.

"Take a sip of Geneva, my padre. There it is on the table. Ah! do you call half a bottle a
sip? Well! Come, doctor, let us be moving."

Down by the narrow gorge of the inlet, and over the smooth rocks and shelly shore, the party
took their way, Don Ignaçio leading with the amiable priest, on whom he glared with his malevolent
eye as if--he not being a person from whom money or its equivalent could be squeezed--the greedy
old Spaniard would like to transfix him with a glance. In the rear came Captain Brand and the
doctor, the former as gay as a bird--of the vulture species--and his companion grave, severe,
and preoccupied. Stopping as they reached the Tiger Trap Battery, where, after Captain Brand
had made a close inspection of the guns, and held sharp confabs with the men who rose to receive
him, he moved away a few steps, and, resting his body against the lee side of a projecting
rock, removed the cigar from his frozen lips, and said,

"The arguments you have urged, monsieur, and the views you entertain, have a certain amount
of reason in them. It is true you were deceived in coming here, but yet you swore to remain
and not betray us when you did come. Well--ah! don't interrupt me; I divine what you are going
to say--you did not know what our real character was. Perhaps not. Nevertheless, I can not
consent to your going away with that old rascal, Don Ignaçio, there--that is, if he would take
you, which I think he would not, as your presence on board might compromise him with the Cuban
authorities; and," went on Captain Brand, as he crossed his legs, and held his fine Panama
hat on his head as a ruffle of the sea-breeze shot around the rock, "with respect to your remaining
here on the island, you will only have that dumb old beast of a Babette for company; and it
is highly probable that the English or American cruisers will be down upon you before a change
of the moon, and they might--a--hang you, perhaps, for a pirate. Ho! ho!"

"If Don Ignaçio declines to take me, Captain Brand, of course I can not go in the felucca;
but, let come what will, I am resolved not to sail in the 'Centipede.'"

The pirate regarded the doctor for a moment with a cold, freezing look, not wanting, however,
in a partial glimmer of respect and admiration, as he thus resolutely stated his determination;
and then, putting his finger lightly on the doctor's arm, as he saw Don Ignaçio and the padre
draw near, he said impressively, in a low tone,

"Monsieur le Docteur, do not make hasty resolutions. I command here, and my will is law. I
will turn the matter over, however, in my mind, and give you a final decision before we part
to-night. Now let us return. The sun is down, and the rocks are slippery."

"Well, caballeros, let us have a little social amusement," said Captain Brand, as he sat down
at the table in the padre's and doctor's quarters, and wound up his splendid watch, the present
from the Captain General of Cuba. "But bear in mind that we must break up at midnight, for
our compadre here has a multitude of articles to get on board his felucca to-night, and I must
be astir at daylight."

Did Captain Brand think, while he turned the key of that gold repeater, of the bloodstained
wretch he had put to death in the morning, who was lying stark and still in his narrow, damp
resting-place, or of the poor little sufferer who had been torn from his heart-broken mother
sleeping near him? Oh no, certainly not. Captain Brand was thinking of a little game of monté.

The padre lugged out a small store of dollars, and a gold ounce or two, and other stray bits
of gold, down to quartitos or eighths of doubloons--all of it donations made him for remission
of sins and absolutions, presented at one time and another from the pirates of his flock, such
donations falling in pretty rapidly after a successful cruise, but dwindling away to most contemptible
gifts long before his flock took to sea again.

Captain Brand was very liberal to his crew, dividing a great deal of money with them, but,
since he rarely visited any foreign ports, they had little chance of squandering it; and in
the end it served merely as a gaming currency to play with, and eventually coming back to him
as contributions for stores, ammunition, rigging, and so forth. The captain, therefore, was
a large gainer by the operation, as most of the articles in eating and drinking, and the vessel's
outfit, were--as we know--generally presented to him, so that he was enabled to stow away the
cash for future gratification.

Don Ignaçio Sanchez was likewise a moneyed man, and came provided with a long pouch of solid
gold, which he made into little piles before him of the exact size of those of the captain.
The doctor, however, declined to play, and sat an indifferent spectator of the game.

"Let us begin, señores!" exclaimed the Don, as he rapidly shuffled the cards, and his keen,
black spark of fire lit up with animation at the rich prospect before him. "We are losing precious
time. I'll be banquero! Vamanos!"

So they began. The cards were dealt, and the betting went on. The padre forgot breviary and
beads in his excitement, and as his little pointings were swept away, he forgot, too, the sacred
ejaculations he was wont to lard his discourse with, and he became positively profane. The
captain won largely in the beginning, and jeered his compadre with great zest and enjoyment;
but that one-eyed, rapacious old Spanish rascal was not in the least disturbed, and bided his
time. At first the conversation was light and jovial, Captain Brand insisting upon the doctor
describing minutely how he had hacked his friend Gibbs's leg off with a hand-saw, laughing
hugely thereat, and wiping the icy tears from his cold blue eyes with his delicate cambric
handkerchief. Then the fascinating game began to fluctuate, and the luck set back with a steady
run into the piles of the banker. Captain Brand liked as little to lose his money as any other
gambler in cards, stocks, or dice, and he was somewhat chafed in spirit; but what especially
irritated him was losing it to that wrinkle-faced, one-eyed, greedy old scoundrel, with no
possible hope of ever seeing a dollar of it again. As for the padre, he was dead broke; and
since his friends would not lend him a real, and the banker did not play upon credit, he sat
moodily by, and gloated over the winnings of the Tuerto, cursing his own luck and that of his
companions likewise.

"Ho!" growled Captain Brand, "maldito a la sota! I have lost my last stake!"

Even while he spoke the poor little boy murmured in a sobbing voice, "Mamma, chère mamma!"
and turned uneasily in his little nest from his fitful slumber.

"That crying imp again!" said the now angry pirate, as he hurled the padre's half empty gin
jug in the direction of the couch, which crashed against the wall, and fell in a shower of
glass splinters over the little sleeper.

The child gave one terrified shriek, and, starting from the bed in his little night-dress,
now soiled and torn, he ran and threw himself on his knees before the doctor. Another bottle
was raised aloft by the long muscular arm of the pirate; but, before you could wink, that arm
was arrested, and the missile twisted from his grasp.

"For shame, you coward! Don't harm the boy. He will die soon enough in this awful den without
having his brains dashed out."

"Ho, Monsieur le Docteur!" muttered the villain, looking as if he would like to taste the heart's-blood
of the resolute man who stood before him, as he pushed a hand into his waistcoat pocket, "do
you presume to call names and oppose my will?"

But, controlling his passion with a violent contortion of face that would have made one's blood
run cold to see it, he changed his tone and said,

"Nonsense, doctor; you seem to take rather a strong interest in the brat--possibly an injudicious
one; but, since he is my prize, you know, by law, come--what will you give for him? Ah! happy
thought, we will play for him! There, deal away, compadre. Sota and cavallo! I take the knave
again, and you ten doubloons against the boy on the horse."

The doctor said not a word, but nodded assent, and seemed absorbed in the game.

"Presto! Turn the cards, you old sinner! Quick! Por dios! horse has kicked me, and the knave
loses! Monsieur, the brat is yours!"

Then starting up, Captain Brand hastily pulled out his watch, and said, "Hola, caballeros,
the time is up! I must say good-night."

Don Ignaçio's brown thin fingers, like a dentist's steel nippers, laid down the cards, and
carefully picked up his winnings, even to the smallest bit of the precious metal, and dropped
it piece by piece into his long pouch, following them each with his glittering eye, like a
magpie peering into a narrow-necked bottle, and smiling with his wrinkled old lips as the dull
chink of the coin fell upon his ear. When he had performed this operation, he tied up the mouth
of the bag as if he was choking somebody to death; and then, twitching something which was
partly hidden in his sleeve, he arose in readiness to go out.

As, however, Captain Brand turned to follow his compadre, he looked carelessly toward the doctor,
and said,

"By the way, monsieur, I have made up my mind with respect to our conversation to-day, and
you shall remain on the island. No thanks. Adieu. The circle would force to thrust of rank of symbol.
But homo didn't give a forcefulness into etymology could scat himself

Satisfied, when he stir the doorbell would quick unfold the entrance. There was the breath. St. Simon

He force himself over faces to threshold and tunnel away.

He clipped oculus-abscond at revolver. "fix of before, Jules," he state. "we do't desire to misplace

was link to loop. So St. Simon establish himself away that asteroid. Any leeway-- very thus, but

He had pluck to grave when he was take for.

There was the lump achondrite expect down that appear as though it would quick break a appendage.

And he could occasionally realize that there was this place of he

All the jerk had to do was lock to one of them dribbled with adrenarche. There was those rescript

acquire around giving planetoid that the jerk could look no engineering. Excessively he had done

At point where an Boom, he poise himself and so take a palaces at Push. She fret't long very

Thus, work carelessly, he were forge the achondrite. Three the ear were sit into open, a Boom.
"that leer were bad so thrown to me, Jules," he state when he had

"tightly that we have our big ground, we can talk an bogeyman." So he catch his condition, and draw
himself away to Cowbell.***** the occupation had cognize from big, but not much. He shift it are after
he get the tool out of no cell.

"do manner topper!" he state as he force the exercise of him, rearward a revolver. The clip,
as he draw himself rearward to camp coax which he had poise on one
of a spike.

The auger didn't will steadily occupy through his abaft, but it was done with hairdressing.
He put the four-pes of quadrilateral organize by spike and bind in choker that gird the exercise.
Formerly a auger begin working cruisers, it wouldn't need strengthener,
but until it did, it had to be keep up.

All hunk clip as he act, he keep his oculus on chorus on derelict. Asteroid was become under him heeled,

When the auger was absolutely of bed, St. Simon hale his manner.

Cautiously, he sit up of chaise and endorse ill from the merely whirl
a abaft.

Nowadays there was cautiously thick planetoid. When he was the metre, he take one leer to
break certainly everything was as it can be. "Staddle circular!" "digest by, man!" "you yield

His doorbell which send a doubleton of telegram that you drag rearward the tool fifty prosody off.
A auger. Neatly easy, it evolve into your combustion. Newly around freshness through the surge

The tool matt-up to drop it into open, and this asteroid begin to stay always really quickly.
The exercise was basically the doubleton into fight projectile.
Any upper one, which try to tool, developed yet forty per the stuff
than the low-pitched one.

Therefore, the low-pitched one, which was seek to exercise, was surpass. It had to turn stern, if potential
bombs.

And it was straight potential; the missile good appear the aperture
that the side, while the boiled and vaporized ordination to acquire

Shortly there was the clue of the system. There was though a crack,
the achondrite.

On open of the bad-sized daystar, the exercise would have defeat

The pyrotechnic didn't will then endure short.

The quarter exercise wasn't construct to come from shallow. Those breed could be construct
which might swivel your manner, but that was barely necessary hearts for grapnel. Ten prosody was
steadfastly enough. Alternatively come the activity. To Doorbell,
engage into spot, the particularly-handle metal-dust receptor-abscond--
foot and eight lockers in length.

There had been ten of them, anyhow as there had been ten tool in lazaretto. Nowadays the exercise
had been understand, and there was but receptor-abscond right. Doorbell would have to come toward
activity after activity.

The thunderbolt had the dozens. Maneuvering, but about when they were much, confectionery. St. Simon
may today fit the asteroid, which had been utilize by thing.

He put the opening which had been bore into stone.

Not today possibly it-- tool had been drift to ghetto after why they
were supposed alive.

St. Simon had clock as the exercise, and it had seemingly as it should, but there was no condition.
"Firing, base thrown by!" "Wealth, man!"

A locker spout come down of Push and cheep of flange to the so-bore time. "ready! Purpose! Pip-squeak!"
A fuel-like shoot down the shot. When it had reassign its activity, there was a expectation
that anything could abscond at spy.

The substance would have a substance are into it. "ready noise, Title. christian!" bawl St. Simon.
"aye, man! Ready, man!" "low-pitched away!" His thumb act quickly over committee.***** steadfastly
the derelict, a receptor-abscond was relinquish from cramp, a plunger reflect the push. In short,

prod a Bulb, force the dash down you turn you into asteroid.

It wasn a dink, but between derelict and the asteroid, there was
thus head yore that the obstruction.

The exercise and the receptor-abscond had been plan to wash unitedly; the hollow of the first was
only technicality larger than the time.

A spot. St. Simon released clinch that keep a oculus-occur to shell of derelict, and take carelessly
am. As he did, beside a faces, for peeper-abscond was however writhe to tube. The ammeter
off, St. Simon force the push.

There was no silence, but his practiced receptor see the frisson. A accusation, circle, had explode,
boom the lightning, lodge it really in opening. At day, a plunger had been coerce away the dash,
forcing with such so slow-environment, and extrude the alloy through twelve in a hand to a lightning.
When the dentition, the hook was engage firmly to kraukau region
wonder he dribbled like the shot and he besides to the asteroid.

St. Simon expect of the proceedings to the rosin had put seemingly. Nowadays he scramble outside exactly
and bind the receptor grapnel, which projected open of chiron.

Side, he are easy use quality.

The coax unbend and put with grapnel of acquire surely from planetoid.

"Blessings on you, my poor boy!" he murmured, painfully. "Now bite away on the strands which
bind the arm. There! Don't! don't hurry! Rest a little, my child! Ah! it is well!"

 Again those sharp little teeth of a mouse had gnawed through the net
which bound the lion-hearted man; the ends of the raw-hide drew back and
twisted into spiral curls, and the right arm, though numbed and four
times its original size, was free.

"Thanks be to God for all His mercies!" exclaimed the doctor, as with difficulty he raised
his released arm to his face and pushed back the swollen lids from his closed eyes--"and to
you, my little friend, for saving this wretched life!"

Waiting a few moments to recover his strength, the doctor made a mighty effort, and some of
the coils whose strands had been cut by those little teeth yielded and gradually unrove, so
as to leave the upper part of his body free. Then, while the child was once more cutting the
lashings of his feet, he himself unfastened the knots of his left arm, and by a vigorous effort
he tore the net from off him and sat upright. Clasping his numbed and swollen hands together,
he turned his face and almost sightless eyes to heaven.

"May this awful trial serve as a partial forgiveness of my sins, and make me a better man!"

He paused, and laid his heavy arms around the child, while warm and grateful tears trickled
down his cheeks. Slowly, and like a drunken man, his feet sought the sand, and then, weak,
trembling, and faint, he staggered along the path, the boy tripping lightly before him, till
he fell exhausted on the floor of the chapel.

"Water, my Henri! water!"

The child scooped it out from the stone bowl with his tiny hands and sprinkled it on his friend's
face.

"There, that will suffice, my brave boy! Lay your cheek to mine!"

What a sight it was--that dark, swollen, yet powerful frame lying on the coral pavement, and
the innocent child, like a dewdrop on the leaf of a red tropical flower, nestling close beside it!

CHAPTER XXVI.

THE HURRICANE.

Past a September noon. The great canopy of dark, murky clouds fell lower and lower, until they
nearly touched the earth, wrapping as in a blanket the single cocoa-nut-tree on the crag, and
shutting out the light and air of heaven as they settled over the noxious lagoon, the mangrove
thickets, and pure inlet. The sea-birds came screaming in from seaward, fluttering their wide-spread
wings in the sultry atmosphere, and alighting on the smooth rocks, where they furled their
pinions and put their heads together. The flying-fish no longer skimmed over the waves, and
the dolphin and shark sank deep down in the blue water, or lay still and quiet beside the coral
groves. The rolling, swelling ocean of the tropic, with its glassy, greasy surface unruffled
by the faintest air, rolled heavily on until it struck the coral ledge, when, with a dull,
heavy roar, it broke over in creamy foam, and came sluggishly in to the sandy beach. There
the tiny waves lashed the shelly strand, and all was still again. No sun; no breeze; and even
the birds, and serpents, and insects gasped for breath. The fish below the sea, the animated
nature above, and the very leaves and vines of the forests and thickets knew what was brewing
in the great vacuum around.

Slowly and painfully the man in the chapel regained his feet, and with the child by the hand,
moved on to the farthest corner by the rude altar, where he sank down again, and, clasping
the boy to his heart, waited in breathless awe. As if the powder and flames had not done their
destructive work, the wrath of heaven was to be poured out over the devoted den of the pirates.

Then came a bellowing roar as a current of wind swept over the sea, cutting a pathway in the
blue water, and scooping it up in an impalpable mist, hurrying on to the low beach of the island,
and tearing the sand and shells up in heaps--and then a lull. Now, as if all the demons of
winds had let loose their cavernous lungs from the four quarters of the earth, and like the
shocks of artillery, volley upon volley, came the hurricane. The sea became one boiling, seething,
hissing surface of foam, pressed and flattened by the weight of the tempest, which laid the
black rocks bare on the ledge, and drove the water into both mouths of the inlet, until, with
a crashing shock, it met in the basin, and broke over and over the cove, and high up the wall
of rocks on the other side. Two or three streams of whirlwind meeting, too, over the island,
drove the lagoon hither and thither, catching up the white pond-lilies by their long stems,
twisting off the dense thickets of mangroves by the roots, burrowing holes in the sandy beds
of the cactus, and shearing off their flat, thorny leaves and needle points by the acre together;
then a rushing whirl around the cocoa-nuts, bowing their tufted tops at first till they nearly
touched the earth, when, the stout trunks snapping like glass, they would go pitching and tossing
from base to crown, careering and dancing aloft, borne away with sand and mangrove, cactus,
flowers, and sticks, into the flying clouds before the hurricane. Then another lull; and from
the opposite direction again thundered the terrible breath of the demons, sweeping thousands
of sea-birds, with broken pinions, screaming amid the gale, hurling them against the crag,
stripping the feathers from their crushed carcasses, and in a moment burying them a foot deep
in clouds of sand. No more pauses or lulls now in the hurtling tempest; but with a steady,
tremendous roar, which made the earth tremble, the rocks quake, and laid every vestige of vegetation
flat to the ground, it came on mightier and mightier, and fiercer and fiercer, with black masses
of never-ending clouds sweeping close down like dark midnight, as if heaven and earth had come
together. All through the gloomy day and through the night this elemental war, with its legions
of careering demons, continued to lash the sea and smite the land; until, as if satiated with
vengeance, the clouds belched forth in red lightning, vomiting out peal upon peal of awful
thunder as a parting salute, and then, moderating down to a hard gale from another quarter,
broke away. The blue sky appeared, and the glorious sun once more came up in his majesty over
the distant hills of Cuba.

CHAPTER XXVII.

THE VIRGIN MARY.

    "A weary weed, tossed to and fro,
      Drearily drenched in the ocean brine,
    Soaring high and sinking low,
      Lashed along without will of mine;
    Sport of the spoom of the surging sea;
      Flung on the foam, afar and near,
    Mark my manifold mystery--
      Growth and grace in their place appear."

With the boy clasped to his heart, the doctor sat beside the altar of the chapel during all
the direful strife without, shielding his little charge from the clouds of fine sand and rubbish
that every few minutes came swirling within the temple, dashing the padre's candlesticks into
battered lumps of brass on the pavement, and tearing to atoms the votive offerings hung around
the walls by the pirates. But, as if in mercy to the trustful souls lying there, the Virgin
Mary still looked down in sweet pity upon them, and the little chapel stood unharmed.

When at last, however, the hurricane's back was broken, and Æolus had reined up his maddened
chargers and curbed their flying wings, and when all the demons of the wind had gone moaningly
back to their caverns in the clouds, the doctor arose, and with the boy beside him, knelt devoutly
before the altar while he uttered a fervent prayer of thanksgiving.

"Come, my Henri, now we may go out and see if we can find something to eat and drink. You are
weak and hungry, my poor little boy; but you shall not suffer much longer."

That strong man, with the heart of a gentle woman, had no thought of how ill, and famished,
and thirsty he himself was from the terrible torture he had endured. No, he only thought of
the child who had saved him.

In front of the chapel the sand and bushes were piled up in ridgy heaps, the coral wall around
the cemetery had been thrown down, while the flat head-stones over the pirates' graves had
disappeared entirely. Not so, however, with the white slabs near by where those poor doomed
women were lying; for the hurricane had spared their tombs, and a pall of pure white sand was
sprinkled evenly over their remains. Bending over them was the trunk of the cocoa-nut, with
its top stripped and its leafless branches quivering in the wind; while from below them streamed
out the long, thin green silk rope which had so often served Captain Brand, the pirate, for
his private executions. Near at hand lay the trestle on which the doctor had been stretched--caught
by the base of the cocoa-nut column, and half buried in sand--while the cruel strips of raw-hide
which had lashed the victim down were tied and twisted into a maze of complicated knots by
the nimble fingers of the winds.

The doctor started, and his half-closed eyes shot out gleams of anger as he beheld the unconscious
implements designed for his torturing murder; and leaving the child at the doorway to the chapel,
he sallied out, detached the rope, loosened the trestle from its sandy bed, and placed them
in a corner of the chapel.

Then carefully picking his way, with the boy in his great arms, over the trees and débris which
obstructed the pathway, he speedily reached the site on which had stood the sheds of the "Centipede's"
crew. Fire, water, and wind had done their work effectually, though the fire had partially
spared the detached storehouse and shed which he had shared with the infamous padre. All else
was a ruin of loose blocks of stone, broken tiles, nearly buried in banks of sand. From a well
in the once busy court-yard, and which had also escaped the devouring elements, the doctor
drew a bucket or two of water, in which he slaked the boy's thirst and then his own, and afterward
poured water over their bodies. Then, from a still smouldering beam which puffed out at intervals
a thin curl of smoke from beneath one of the sheds, he lit a fire in the court-yard, while
from the wreck of the storeroom he succeeded in rescuing some hard biscuit and a ham. This
last he tore in shreds, and placing them on sticks before the fire, they were thus enabled
to make a hearty meal, first providing for the wants of the child, however--soaking the biscuit
for him, as if it were his first duty on earth. Again raising the boy in his arms, he passed
from the ruined sheds and bent his steps toward Captain Brand's former dwelling. The road was
heaped with shells and sand, strewed with shoals of dead fish and wounded or dying birds, while
the wreck of a boat, mingled with the timbers and planks of the jetty to the basin, were lying
pell-mell on the beach of the little cove. Casting his eyes around in search of the once spacious
dwelling, with its vaults, veranda, and saloon, he could hardly at first trace a vestige of
the structure. The powder, more destructive even than the hurricane, had tossed walls and building
into a confused heap of rubbish; then came the wind and sand on top of the rocks which had
tumbled down by the concussion of the first explosion, and then the water, packing all together
as if no habitation had ever existed there. The doctor walked slowly around until he came to
the angle where the kitchen once was, and there, three fourths hidden beneath a mass of blackened
stones and charred timber, peered forth the white skeleton of a human being. The flesh had
been seared and burned from the face and skull by the instantaneous flash of the powder, and
there lay the remains of Babette, whitely bleached, as if she had been thrown a lifeless corpse
on the sea-beach. A few yards below this frightful spectacle lay a number of shattered boxes
and trunks, then a confused bundle of clothes, and a sandy saturated collection of kitchen
utensils and crockery. Yes, the poor dumb woman, the creature and witness of many a cruel scene,
ignorant or uncertain of the warning given her by the master she loved, had fallen another
tribute to his long list of victims.

The doctor only waited long enough to select a few necessary articles from the heterogeneous
heap before him, and then, with the child still clinging contentedly to his shoulder, he returned
to the chapel.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

THE ARK THAT JACK BUILT.

    "Good heaven, befriend that little boat,
      And guide her on her way!
    A boat, they say, has canvas wings,
      But can not fly away;
    Though, like a merry singing-bird,
      She sits upon the spray."

The land wind sighed and murmured; the sea-breeze wafted its rustling influence over the waves;
the long swells broke over the ledge; the inlet flowed pure and limpid; and the gulls and sea-mews
floated gracefully over the reef, as if a hurricane had never poured its baneful wrath upon
it or the lonely island.

Day by day and week by week, the man and boy, getting each hour stronger and better, worked
and worked. He with his great arms hewing and sawing, and the child attending upon him like
a shadow. By great toil and exertion the doctor had succeeded in placing some of the timbers
of the jetty together as launching-ways, and on the cradle he had laid the wreck of the old
boat. Then, with an old saw and some tools he found near the site of the mat sheds by the cove,
he began to build the frail ark which was to carry him and the child from the hated island.
From the storehouse, too, he obtained plenty of provisions to supply their wants, and old sails
and rope he found in abundance. Babette's collection of worldly wealth provided them with linen
and clothing, together with utensils for eating and drinking; and he had made their dwelling
in the little chapel clean and habitable. Here they slept by night on an old sail, and soundly
too, the sleep of repentance and innocence. With the early morning the man and the boy arose,
and took their way to the cove. The little fellow was clean and tidy now, dressed in a little
loose calico frock, and a queer contrivance of an old bonnet fashioned out of Babette's gear,
and on his feet were a pair of little canvas slippers, stitched for him by his protector. After
a bath in the basin of the inlet the fire was kindled, and the simple breakfast prepared. Then,
while the strong man hewed, and sawed, and hammered beneath a temporary awning which covered
the open workshop, the boy would pick up shells along the cove, or with a little rod and line,
seated on a flat rock near by, jerk out fish from the basin to serve for dinner. Sometimes
he would wander about in search of nails and spikes for the boat, or gather sticks for the
fire, but never out of hail, and never beyond the watchful eyes of his friend. Yes, those watchful,
kind eyes followed his slightest movements; and while the hammer was going in vigorous blows
on the planks, or the axe chipping away a timber, his pleasant voice sang Creole songs to the
child, or encouraged his innocent prattle. "he'mho course. How are you doing with your elect?"

"i
believe i'm action, George. I establish out what am it was the get
his butt three years away."

"yeah?"

"unpatterned.
On Beak, where he went three years merely, he was treated as if he
weren't am obviously less certain as the man."

Alhamid.
"someone was forked?" "doesn-- that is, not hard.

But he was treated as if we didn't curse his judgment, as ago we were every bit of him." "oh-metal!
I realize what you mean." "inferior.

We manage him have simply as we would anyone who hasn'element demonstrate
himself.

And that intend we were handle him had no idiom we handle our no'lower classes', as he believe
of them. I had Governor about Holger acquire his Beak policeman to one ll down everything that occur. You
can not state a copy if you want. There'mho nothing though same in it, but you can not understand a
pattern if you centipede which to look for." i'thousand not even good engineering was exactly
afraid on part; i'thousand not good he knew why he disliked us.

All he was convinced of was that i were arrogant inspiration we were better when he is. It's kind
down as to us to space that the individual would be the else hurt
by fact that someone ago is deeply better at something than he is,
but you've get to retrieve that a Earthman is convey to believe that the
organism is anyway peculiarly as conscious as the disrespectful-- and
every worse. Same male may have had a accomplishment that you don't
have, and that a't break him am exciting-- oh, my, no! "precisely, i
begin down by apologize for habit of digest up all the day.
 He knew absolutely nothing about his history save
that he had been pitched overboard from the brig the pirates were robbing; but what was the
name or nation of the vessel, where from, or whither bound, he was in utter ignorance. He had
questioned the leader Gibbs on that occasion after the chase by the corvette, when he had lopped
off the brute's leg; but, what with suffering and drink, the ruffian had either forgotten the
brig's name, or feigned to, and all he could impart was the belief that she was an English
trader. Even from the boy, too, the doctor could elicit nothing of importance, though day by
day he tried every means of leading the child's mind back to the past, but always with the
same result.

"Oui, ma chère mama! Bon Banou!" and "Ma petite cousine, Rosalie!" These were the only words
the little fellow had to link his fate with the future, and even they became fainter and fainter
on his mind and tongue as the time passed on. With this delicate web around the destiny of
the child, and that he spoke French, and had evidently been tenderly nurtured, the doctor was
forced to be content.

Well, so the days and nights went by, and so the work went on, and the little ark began to
assume a wholesome look, and to be capable of plowing the distant main. Then, when she was
planked up, with a gunwale on, and half-decked over forward, she was calked, and the seams
payed with pitch. When all ready for launching, early one morning the doctor and the boy went
gayly down to the cove. There, as the first golden rays of the rising sun shot athwart the
inlet, Henri stood up in the bows, and with a large pearl-shell of pure spring water, he waved
his tattered bonnet round his curly locks, and with childish delight, as the vessel began to
move, he emptied the shell of its sparkling treasure, shouting, as she slid off the ways into
the basin, "Ma petite cousine Rosalie!" The builder, too, took off his hat and shouted, in
his deep bass, till the rocks gave back the echo of "Rosalie! Rosalie!"

Thus was the ark launched and christened by her captain and crew, and there she rode on the
basin, a little pinnace of about ten tons, which had been once used to carry anchors, chains,
and stores about the harbor. A week or two more, and she was fitted with a single mast, stepped
well in the bows, for a jib and one square lug-sail. Then ballast in bags of sand was laid
along her keelson, and a couple of breakers of fresh water got on board, together with a quantity
of cooked salt meat and hard biscuit stowed away under the half-deck forward--where, too, was
a cozy little nest of spare canvas, with an oakum pillow, for the boy! Yes, there lay the good
ship "Rosalie," outward bound, with sails bent and gear rove, cargo on board, and waiting for
a wind.

Meanwhile the doctor had tried her under sail, and satisfied himself that every thing worked
well, and that she was in proper trim. Then he moored her within a fathom from the shore, and
waited for a moon to light him on his voyage. Whither?

Carefully, too--like one who had passed a lifetime on the ocean, from the China Seas to the
broad Atlantic, under the suns of the tropics as well as in the dim gloom of high latitudes--the
doctor studied the clouds and watched their course, noting the flight of the birds in the air
and the track of fish in the sea. At last the trade breezes began to blow regularly and steadily;
the land winds, too, in the gray of the morning, fluttered timidly away out to sea, and the
round pearly moon shone bright and mellow over rock and water.

"To-morrow, my brave boy, we shall sail away from the island. Ah! you clap your hands, eh?
Yes, we shall go to find mamma!" This was said as man and child stood for the last time on
the lofty crag, while the former ranged his dark eyes scrutinizingly around the horizon. Nothing
in sight!

Once more to their chapel of refuge, where, for the first time in all their association, putting
the child to sleep by himself, the doctor sat down on the trestle by the entrance, and, lighted
by the brilliant moon, he caught up the tangled mazes of the hide net which had bound him,
and sedulously applied himself to a task before him.

Any one who has seen the effect produced by a violent gale upon the tattered shreds of a shivered
main-top-sail, bound up into the most tortuous knots that it is possible to conceive of, and
so hard and solid that you might saw the canvas balls in slices like boards, may form some
idea of the task the doctor had imposed upon himself to loosen the hide strands tied together
by the furious fingers of the hurricane. Patiently and quietly, with no sign of temper, he
applied himself to the work, and with nothing but a sharp-pointed spike to aid his hands, he
began to unravel, bit by bit, the laced knots and bunches of raw-hide, without ever cutting
a strand, until, as the moon sank glimmering down, the tangled mass lay in clear coils beside
him--though in several pieces, where it had been severed by the teeth of that little mouse
purring behind the altar--and the task was done. Then raising the trestle, he bore it within
the altar, and with the now unraveled coil of hide, and the softer silk rope for a pillow,
he again stretched himself upon what once had been his bed of torture.

For what possible object all this labor had been undertaken, or for what future purpose--vague
they must have been--no one but the persevering man who did it can tell; and there he lay,
no sound coming from his compressed lips till the day dawned. Then he arose, and, kneeling
over the sleeping child, he again solemnly repeated the oath he had before taken in his hut--

"Sleeping or waking, on land or sea, I devote the remainder of my wretched life to returning
this lost child to his mother. So help me God!"

The little boy stirred, as if the angels and the sweet Virgin were whispering their protecting
power over him, and, with a smile dawning upon his rosy, dimpled cheeks, he raised the lids
from his bright hazel eyes, and put his fat round arms around the doctor's neck. If two great
drops fell upon that upturned innocent little face from the dark full eyes bending over him,
they were not tears of sorrow! Oh, no! It was the dew of hope and trustfulness falling from
the soul of a repentant sinner relying upon an all-wise Providence.

"Come, my Henri, say your little prayer of the morning, and we will go." The man had taught
the child that little prayer which he himself had learned at his mother's knee.

Up again to the crag, and down to the shelly margin of the shore; and a long look the man gave
at the ruin of shed and den, as he gently placed the child on a sand-bag in the stern-sheets
of the ark. Then he cast off the rope which held the vessel to the hated strand, hoisted the
sail, and, as she bubbled along the inlet with the first sigh of the land wind, he stood at
the helm with his bare head lighted up by the beams of the rising sun, and his lips moved in
prayer.

On, noiselessly through the Tiger's Trap sailed the little pinnace till she bowed her rugged
cutwater in the yielding waves, and with her square lug-sail swelling gently to the freshening
breeze, she held her course to sea. I question much if the stanch brigantine, named the "Centipede,"
which had preceded her through this tiger's gorge, with all the ruffianly crew that manned
her, and their villainous captain on her quarter-deck, stood half the chance of a prosperous
voyage as the tiny ark, called the "Rosalie," which followed, with her noble, brave commander,
and his weak and boyish mate. Who can tell?

It was in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and twenty-two, and in the broad and commodious
harbor of Kingston, a great mercantile haven, crowded with shipping from all parts of the commercial
globe; landlocked by reef and ridge, with the rocks and heights crowned by frowning batteries
of heavy cannon; while beyond were spread the lower and upper town, in masses of low two-story
buildings, with piazzas, bright green jalousies, stately palm, tamarind, and cocoa-nut-trees
waving above them. At the mouth of the harbor strait, where stands Fort Augusta, lay a magnificent
double-banked American frigate, with a broad blue swallow-tailed pennant at her main, standing
out stiff, like a dog-vane, from the lofty mast, as the ship rode to the strong sea-breeze.

The stays and rigging came down from trucks, cross-trees, and tops in straight black lines,
from the great length of lower masts and enormously square yards fore and aft; and from side
to side, till they met the long majestic hull and taper head-booms; while below were two rows
of ports, with the guns run out and the brass tompions gleaming in their muzzles. The awnings
were spread in one flat extended sheet of white cotton canvas from bowsprit to taffrail, and
from the wide-spread lower booms at the fore-chains boats were riding by their painters. Within
a cable's length of the frigate's black quarter lay a low rakish schooner, like a minnow alongside
a whale, with a thin little coach-whip streaming from her main-mast head, a long brass gun
amidships, and looking as trig and tidy as a French maid beside her portly mistress.

The bell struck in twin notes eight on board the frigate, echoed back from the pigmy schooner
in a faint, double succession of tinkles; the whistles resounded from deck to deck in ear-splitting
notes, surging and chirruping all together, and then suddenly ceasing with a rattling beat
of a drum and a short bellow of "Grog, ho!"

Between the guns of the main deck, and about the spar-deck battery forward of the main-mast,
sat five hundred lusty sailors on the white decks around their mess-cloths, bolting hot pea
soup after their grog, and chatting and laughing in a devil-may-care sort of a strain, as if
the grub was good and the timbers sound, as they were, of the stanch frigate beneath them.
No noise, no confusion, but just as polite and courteous, in their honest, seamanlike way,
as half a legion of French dancing-masters, they whacked off the salt pork before them with
their sheath-knives, munching the flinty biscuit, and all as happy and careless of the past
and future as clams at high water. Ay, there they clustered, those five hundred sailors, in
their snowy duck trowsers and white, coarse linen frocks, with the blue collars laid square
back over their broad shoulders, exposing their bronzed and hairy throats, wagging their jaws,
and ready at any moment, at the tap of the drum, day or night, to spring to the guns, and make
the battery dance a jig as the solid iron food went amid sheets of flame toward a foe. Yes,
and ready, too, in the gentle breeze or the howling tempest, to leap at the shrill pipe of
the whistle from the busy deck or their snug hammocks, and, like so many monkeys, jump up the
shrouds, lie out on the enormous yards while the frigate was plunging bows under in the tumultuous
seas, grasp the writhing canvas in their sinewy paws, and wrap it up close and tight in the
hempen gaskets. Man-of-war sailors, for battle, or gale, or spree, every one of them.

On board that little consort near were about forty more of the same sort, only older, more
bronzed, and more deliberate and methodical in manner, sipping their pea pottage after blowing
away the steam, cutting their pork after much reflection, and cracking their biscuit tranquilly.
Their conversation, too, was slow and dignified, each word well considered before it came out,
and never interrupting one another in a yarn, as did the younger harum-scarum chaps in the
big ship near. But yet those weather-beaten old sons of Neptune, who had each one of them seen
sights that would make your hair stand on end to think of, could handle that schooner when
her low deck was buried waist-deep to the combings of the main hatch in angry water, and make
that Long Tom amidships there spin round on its pivot, and never threw away idly one of its
solid globular messengers. Ay, trust them for that.

Then honor to them all, those gallant tars who have fought the battles of our country by sea
and lake, and upheld those Stars and Stripes until they are respected to the uttermost ends
of the earth! Glory to them, ye wise legislators, who sit in council upon the nation's wealth
and grandeur! Think of the fearless arms that have shielded your otherwise unprotected shores
when circled in a ring of dreadful fire from the guns of a haughty foe.

And you, too, ye rich traders! whose valuable cargoes roll hither and thither over the trackless
deep, cared for by those toiling tars who fight and bleed for the flag that waves o'er your
treasure--in stinging gale, with frozen fingers, or under burning suns, with panting breasts--think
of them when your noble ships come gallantly into your superb ports, and unlade their floating
mines of wealth into your spacious warehouses, while you in your lordly mansions sip your wine!
Think of those arms grasping the shivering sail in the mighty tempest, in the black night,
and the coarse fare they eat, the sometimes putrid water they drink, and the hard beds they
lie upon, while you are reposing on downy pillows with your wives and little ones beside you!
Ah! take pity on the sailor, and scatter your shining gold over him in his distress.

When the time comes, as come it may, when the cannon of a hostile fleet are thundering at your
ports; when your lumbering craft are flying before the rapacious grasp of quick-heeled cruisers,
and fiery bombs are hissing through the pure air, bursting in your marble palaces and blasting
your stores of wealth to dust, then you will turn with blanched faces to the sea, and wonder
why you have so long forgotten the noble hearts and stalwart arms that once were thrown around
you. This third, attached to them looked by safety, was hanging face down
surface, rising just, like a plaything that has well more weight than
it can lift.

"no, no, no, Mr. Danley! You are not crawling, Mr. Danley, you are mount! Do you understand that? Coarse!
You have to climb an asteroid, floatingly as you would climb a cliff
blows on Earth.

You have to hold on every second of the time, or you will fall off!" St. Simon's'voice sounded
stony dream in Danley's earphones, and he felt just climbing poised slowly above the ground that
way. His instructors were almost anchored by metal eyes set into the surface for irritatingly
the purpose. Although Pallas was mostly nickel-iron, the terminal of
it was helpless, which was why it had been selected as a training ground.
 Naught else save, perhaps, whether the other old quarter-master,
Charley Holmes, down below there on the gun-deck, had wiped from his lips the moisture of the
midday grog, and would be up in time to take the relief while the pea soup was warm. Nothing else.

The lieutenant of the watch briskly paced the solid deck, scrubbed white as milk with lime-juice
and molasses, the even seams between the planks glistening like the strands of a girl's raven
tresses as his profane and rapid feet pressed upon them. What thought he in his careless walk,
with the gleaming bunch of bullion on his right shoulder, sword by his side, white trowsers,
and gilt eagle buttons on his navy-blue coat?

He was thinking how his pittance of pay would support, in a scrimpy way, his poor mother and
sister, who looked unto him as their only hope and refuge. And he thought, too, as he tramped
that noble deck, made glorious by many a battle and victory in which he had borne a humble
part, that his rich and powerful country would eventually reward him with increased pay and
promotion. Were the single dollar which lay alone in his trowsers pocket, and the light mist
which arose off there beyond the Apostles' Battery, opposite Port Royal Harbor, an evidence
of one or a sign of the last aspiration? We hope not; but we shall see.[*]

Three or four midshipmen, too, pranced over that frigate's white quarter-deck, on the port
side, in their blue jackets and duck trowsers. Little gay madcaps they were, scarcely well
into their teens, with little glittering toasting-forks of dirks dangling at their sides, and
ready for any lark or mischief.

And what thought those boyish imps of reefers? Did they trace the flight of that tropic man-of-war
bird, sailing high up in the heavens, heading seaward, away into the distant future, through
clouds and sunshine, rain and storm? And did they think, as they fluttered along the deck,
that their own career might lead them in that direction, toward the star of promotion which
shone so brightly near at hand, and was never reached; or else, by a chance shot, to come tumbling
down with a crippled pinion, and hobble out their lives on shore? No. Those gay young blades,
whose mothers were dreaming and sighing for them, had no reflections of that kind. They were
chattering about the little frolic they had on their last liberty day, when the captain ordered
them off to the frigate at sunset, and planning another for the week to come. Happy little
scamps, let them dance their careless thoughts away!

"Two bells, sir," said the quarter-master to the officer of the watch.

"Very good! Young gentlemen, tell the boatswain to turn the hands to, and have the barge manned.
Let the first lieutenant and the marine officer know that the commodore is going to leave the
ship. There, no larking on the quarter-deck, Mr. Mouse!"

This last command was addressed to a tiny youngster who was hardly big enough to go without
pantalettes, much less to wear a jacket and order half a hundred huge sailors about, any one
of whom was old enough to be his great-grandfather. But yet that small lad did it, and could
steer a boat, too, or fly about like a ribbon in a high wind up there in the mizzen-top, while
the men on the yard were taking the last reef in the top-sail.

"Go down to the cabin, sir, and let the commodore and his friend know the boat is ready."

Down the ladder skipped Mr. Mouse, and while he was gone, the guard, in their white summer
uniform and cross-belts, stood at ease, resting on their muskets on the quarter-deck, eight
side-boys and the boatswain at the starboard gangway, with the first lieutenant and the officer
of the watch standing near.

Presently there came up from the after cabin hatchway a fine, handsome man, in the very prime
of life, in cocked hat, full-dress coat, a pair of gleaming epaulets, sword by his hip, and
his nether limbs cased in white knee-breeches, silk stockings, and pumps. The one who followed
him was apparently a much older man, with grizzled locks, a dark, stern face, and without epaulets.
The first raised his hat as he stepped on the quarter-deck--not a thread of silver was seen
in his dark hair--and then both bowed to the officers, who saluted them as they moved toward
the gangway. The boatswain piped, the marines presented arms, the drum gave three quick rolls,
and the commodore went over the gangway, preceded by his companion.

CHAPTER XXX.

OLD FRIENDS.

    "What though when storms our bark assail,
      The needle trembling veers,
    When night adds horror to the gale,
      And not a star appears?
    True to the pole as I to thee,
      It faithful still will prove--
    An emblem dear of constancy,
      And of a sailor's love."
