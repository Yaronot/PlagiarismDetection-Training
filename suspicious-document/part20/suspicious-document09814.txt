CHAPTER THE FIRST.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE FOOD.

I.

In the middle years of the nineteenth century there first became abundant in this strange world
of ours a class of men, men tending for the most part to become elderly, who are called, and
who are very properly called, but who dislike extremely to be called--"Scientists." They dislike
that word so much that from the columns of Nature, which was from the first their distinctive
and characteristic paper, it is as carefully excluded as if it were--that other word which
is the basis of all really bad language in this country. But the Great Public and its Press
know better, and "Scientists" they are, and when they emerge to any sort of publicity, "distinguished
scientists" and "eminent scientists" and "well-known scientists" is the very least we call them.

Certainly both Mr. Bensington and Professor Redwood quite merited any of these terms long before
they came upon the marvellous discovery of which this story tells. Mr. Bensington was a Fellow
of the Royal Society and a former president of the Chemical Society, and Professor Redwood
was Professor of Physiology in the Bond Street College of the London University, and he had
been grossly libelled by the anti-vivisectionists time after time. And they had led lives of
academic distinction from their very earliest youth.

They were of course quite undistinguished looking men, as indeed all true Scientists are. There
is more personal distinction about the mildest-mannered actor alive than there is about the
entire Royal Society. Mr. Bensington was short and very, very bald, and he stooped slightly;
he wore gold-rimmed spectacles and cloth boots that were abundantly cut open because of his
numerous corns, and Professor Redwood was entirely ordinary in his appearance. Until they happened
upon the Food of the Gods (as I must insist upon calling it) they led lives of such eminent
and studious obscurity that it is hard to find anything whatever to tell the reader about them.

Mr. Bensington won his spurs (if one may use such an expression of a gentleman in boots of
slashed cloth) by his splendid researches upon the More Toxic Alkaloids, and Professor Redwood
rose to eminence--I do not clearly remember how he rose to eminence! I know he was very eminent,
and that's all. Things of this sort grow. I fancy it was a voluminous work on Reaction Times
with numerous plates of sphygmograph tracings (I write subject to correction) and an admirable
new terminology, that did the thing for him.

The general public saw little or nothing of either of these gentlemen. Sometimes at places
like the Royal Institution and the Society of Arts it did in a sort of way see Mr. Bensington,
or at least his blushing baldness and something of his collar and coat, and hear fragments
of a lecture or paper that he imagined himself to be reading audibly; and once I remember--one
midday in the vanished past--when the British Association was at Dover, coming on Section C
or D, or some such letter, which had taken up its quarters in a public-house, and following
two, serious-looking ladies with paper parcels, out of mere curiosity, through a door labelled
"Billiards" and "Pool" into a scandalous darkness, broken only by a magic-lantern circle of
Redwood's tracings.
