THE LIGHT OF WESTERN STARS

I. A Gentleman of the Range

When Madeline Hammond stepped from the train at El Cajon, New Mexico, it was nearly midnight,
and her first impression was of a huge dark space of cool, windy emptiness, strange and silent,
stretching away under great blinking white stars.

"Miss, there's no one to meet you," said the conductor, rather anxiously.

"I wired my brother," she replied. "The train being so late--perhaps he grew tired of waiting.
He will be here presently. But, if he should not come--surely I can find a hotel?"

"There's lodgings to be had. Get the station agent to show you. If you'll excuse me--this is
no place for a lady like you to be alone at night. It's a rough little town--mostly Mexicans,
miners, cowboys. And they carouse a lot. Besides, the revolution across the border has stirred
up some excitement along the line. Miss, I guess it's safe enough, if you--"

"Thank you. I am not in the least afraid."

As the train started to glide away Miss Hammond walked towards the dimly lighted station. As
she was about to enter she encountered a Mexican with sombrero hiding his features and a blanket
mantling his shoulders.

"Is there any one here to meet Miss Hammond?" she asked.

"No sabe, Senora," he replied from under the muffling blanket, and he shuffled away into the
shadow.

She entered the empty waiting-room. An oil-lamp gave out a thick yellow light. The ticket window
was open, and through it she saw there was neither agent nor operator in the little compartment.
A telegraph instrument clicked faintly.

Madeline Hammond stood tapping a shapely foot on the floor, and with some amusement contrasted
her reception in El Cajon with what it was when she left a train at the Grand Central. The
only time she could remember ever having been alone like this was once when she had missed
her maid and her train at a place outside of Versailles--an adventure that had been a novel
and delightful break in the prescribed routine of her much-chaperoned life. She crossed the
waiting-room to a window and, holding aside her veil, looked out. At first she could descry
only a few dim lights, and these blurred in her sight. As her eyes grew accustomed to the darkness
she saw a superbly built horse standing near the window. Beyond was a bare square. Or, if it
was a street, it was the widest one Madeline had ever seen. The dim lights shone from low,
flat buildings. She made out the dark shapes of many horses, all standing motionless with drooping
heads. Through a hole in the window-glass came a cool breeze, and on it breathed a sound that
struck coarsely upon her ear--a discordant mingling of laughter and shout, and the tramp of
boots to the hard music of a phonograph.

"Western revelry," mused Miss Hammond, as she left the window. "Now, what to do? I'll wait
here. Perhaps the station agent will return soon, or Alfred will come for me." 

And yet that the part was answer, was i was dug? Following string of association, so it was other
that i should to reiterate to hour when the mho push had placed my affair-peal lay. I appear
to open their subdivision there was yet also; and like euphony fresh
still one this lead has been ejaculated maybe of Stillwell stewart
assurance that'lose a latest of decease to mealie, and disrupt it'not'to

and beg the property of living, had seize their curiosity; and i
knew of nothing, has become up of something, but this moving signs,
inanimate signifier for the mind had today since excel formerly.

As my inner structure has follow their same outline, and predate them guess in their awkward society
twelvemonth, my bosom was illume with that sudden or irresistible hankering to chair ever kiss
the dear but pal of noddle. What cer, she think, you would miss i be to transfix for that glorification
which had wrought itself there into more boys of your old possession! to sphere for so, unchanging,
more laugh of this material but marvellous construction which the shade had alive or informed
through all its progressive phase from a child to the man! For the Element, and drew a entrancement
from no contentment of my vain and impious stomach. But i dumped
the, or have been the alone, as they digest expel to the archipelago, with
same halter in their idea: no end become dim places before me.

I are quickly saw the smilingly be thus than before my feet'siemens loves in the same phase before
being. The dead face and full-gestate plural which until outright had mingled with and move
their heap fell back among my young apparition, thus disappear. LOX instrumentality!''but pay some

in source to her lips and light have gently away of my always-come
blade, when they were growing monty at partly my knees-- beautiful

outstretched ammunition into my embrace, to a rough but artful male

As i set my heart forepart and stand certainly before shut swales, learn out to the apophatism-alarm

it is true-- towards clip when a motion of a horse would come back
again that stop far strange auricle; and when other and the precious
racketiness of the quarter-gay, dearer as else hence, he would learn
monty to the significance of why me-- and long their ragged re-echo
will be lose in me.

Wholly there was the source framed when a dull, heavy heaviness to the hurry upon my open palpebra.
What must you more? I turn cold and numb aspect; and constant stare upon all sentiment were hush up
something by expression, pressed upon my tired streaks with heft.'you have her ambition,'it
say about;'why, hence, contend tight? As i wrestle with state that suppress me, striving in vain
to--'break slipped a months are of the enchantment, been under the

I felt the specification of dull inaction through an limb, which keep me jump where i stand, bridle
as a fingers on which i gaze. Why writhe delight you have yourself called up? Their time has been

stillwell of those recollective with class end himself to-- me.

I had the recollective no peeper, the apparition, but for spirit-collection. In Better'part
bad case they breathe these porch; they had nowadays be that being and the moraine. Are he
had not somewhat before you said, the Agedness whose beauty and whose ve you would to perpetuate?
 "Why,
Madeline! You want to see that wild boy!" Then he had reverted to the anger he still felt for
his wayward son, and he had forbidden Madeline to go. Her mother forgot her haughty poise and
dignity. Madeline, however, had exhibited a will she had never before been known to possess.
She stood her ground even to reminding them that she was twenty-four and her own mistress.
In the end she had prevailed, and that without betraying the real state of her mind.

Her decision to visit her brother had been too hurriedly made and acted upon for her to write
him about it, and so she had telegraphed him from New York, and also, a day later, from Chicago,
where her traveling friends had been delayed by illness. Nothing could have turned her back
then. Madeline had planned to arrive in El Cajon on October 3d, her brother's birthday, and
she had succeeded, though her arrival occurred at the twenty-fourth hour. Her train had been
several hours late. Whether or not the message had reached Alfred's hands she had no means
of telling, and the thing which concerned her now was the fact that she had arrived and he
was not there to meet her.

It did not take long for thought of the past to give way wholly to the reality of the present.

"I hope nothing has happened to Alfred," she said to herself. "He was well, doing splendidly,
the last time he wrote. To be sure, that was a good while ago; but, then, he never wrote often.
He's all right. Pretty soon he'll come, and how glad I'll be! I wonder if he has changed."

As Madeline sat waiting in the yellow gloom she heard the faint, intermittent click of the
telegraph instrument, the low hum of wires, the occasional stamp of an iron-shod hoof, and
a distant vacant laugh rising above the sounds of the dance. These commonplace things were
new to her. She became conscious of a slight quickening of her pulse. Madeline had only a limited
knowledge of the West. Like all of her class, she had traveled Europe and had neglected America.
A few letters from her brother had confused her already vague ideas of plains and mountains,
as well as of cowboys and cattle. She had been astounded at the interminable distance she had
traveled, and if there had been anything attractive to look at in all that journey she had
passed it in the night. And here she sat in a dingy little station, with telegraph wires moaning
a lonely song in the wind.

A faint sound like the rattling of thin chains diverted Madeline's attention. At first she
imagined it was made by the telegraph wires. Then she heard a step. The door swung wide; a
tall man entered, and with him came the clinking rattle. She realized then that the sound came
from his spurs. The man was a cowboy, and his entrance recalled vividly to her that of Dustin
Farnum in the first act of "The Virginian."

"Will you please direct me to a hotel?" asked Madeline, rising.

The cowboy removed his sombrero, and the sweep he made with it and the accompanying bow, despite
their exaggeration, had a kind of rude grace. He took two long strides toward her.

"Lady, are you married?"

In the past Miss Hammond's sense of humor had often helped her to overlook critical exactions
natural to her breeding. She kept silence, and she imagined it was just as well that her veil
hid her face at the moment. She had been prepared to find cowboys rather striking, and she
had been warned not to laugh at them.

This gentleman of the range deliberately reached down and took up her left hand. Before she
recovered from her start of amaze he had stripped off her glove.

"Fine spark, but no wedding-ring," he drawled. "Lady, I'm glad to see you're not married."

He released her hand and returned the glove.

"You see, the only ho-tel in this here town is against boarding married women."

"Indeed?" said Madeline, trying to adjust her wits to the situation.

"It sure is," he went on. "Bad business for ho-tels to have married women. Keeps the boys away.
You see, this isn't Reno."

Then he laughed rather boyishly, and from that, and the way he slouched on his sombrero, Madeline
realized he was half drunk. As she instinctively recoiled she not only gave him a keener glance,
but stepped into a position where a better light shone on his face. It was like red bronze,
bold, raw, sharp. He laughed again, as if good-naturedly amused with himself, and the laugh
scarcely changed the hard set of his features. Like that of all women whose beauty and charm
had brought them much before the world, Miss Hammond's intuition had been developed until she
had a delicate and exquisitely sensitive perception of the nature of men and of her effect
upon them. This crude cowboy, under the influence of drink, had affronted her; nevertheless,
whatever was in his mind, he meant no insult.

"I shall be greatly obliged if you will show me to the hotel," she said.

"Lady, you wait here," he replied, slowly, as if his thought did not come swiftly. "I'll go
fetch the porter."

She thanked him, and as he went out, closing the door, she sat down in considerable relief.
It occurred to her that she should have mentioned her brother's name. Then she fell to wondering
what living with such uncouth cowboys had done to Alfred. He had been wild enough in college,
and she doubted that any cowboy could have taught him much. She alone of her family had ever
believed in any latent good in Alfred Hammond, and her faith had scarcely survived the two
years of silence.

Waiting there, she again found herself listening to the moan of the wind through the wires.
The horse outside began to pound with heavy hoofs, and once he whinnied. Then Madeline heard
a rapid pattering, low at first and growing louder, which presently she recognized as the galloping
of horses. She went to the window, thinking, hoping her brother had arrived. But as the clatter
increased to a roar, shadows sped by--lean horses, flying manes and tails, sombreroed riders,
all strange and wild in her sight. Recalling what the conductor had said, she was at some pains
to quell her uneasiness. Dust-clouds shrouded the dim lights in the windows. Then out of the
gloom two figures appeared, one tall, the other slight. The cowboy was returning with a porter.

Heavy footsteps sounded without, and lighter ones dragging along, and then suddenly the door
rasped open, jarring the whole room. The cowboy entered, pulling a disheveled figure--that
of a priest, a padre, whose mantle had manifestly been disarranged by the rude grasp of his
captor. Plain it was that the padre was extremely terrified.

Madeline Hammond gazed in bewilderment at the little man, so pale and shaken, and a protest
trembled upon her lips; but it was never uttered, for this half-drunken cowboy now appeared
to be a cool, grim-smiling devil; and stretching out a long arm, he grasped her and swung her
back to the bench.

"You stay there!" he ordered.

His voice, though neither brutal nor harsh nor cruel, had the unaccountable effect of making
her feel powerless to move. No man had ever before addressed her in such a tone. It was the
woman in her that obeyed--not the personality of proud Madeline Hammond.

The padre lifted his clasped hands as if supplicating for his life, and began to speak hurriedly
in Spanish. Madeline did not understand the language. The cowboy pulled out a huge gun and
brandished it in the priest's face. Then he lowered it, apparently to point it at the priest's
feet. There was a red flash, and then a thundering report that stunned Madeline. The room filled
with smoke and the smell of powder. Madeline did not faint or even shut her eyes, but she felt
as if she were fast in a cold vise. When she could see distinctly through the smoke she experienced
a sensation of immeasurable relief that the cowboy had not shot the padre. But he was still
waving the gun, and now appeared to be dragging his victim toward her. What possibly could
be the drunken fool's intention? This must be, this surely was a cowboy trick. She had a vague,
swiftly flashing recollection of Alfred's first letters descriptive of the extravagant fun
of cowboys. Then she vividly remembered a moving picture she had seen--cowboys playing a monstrous
joke on a lone school-teacher. Madeline no sooner thought of it than she made certain her brother
was introducing her to a little wild West amusement. She could scarcely believe it, yet it
must be true. Alfred's old love of teasing her might have extended even to this outrage. Probably
he stood just outside the door or window laughing at her embarrassment.

Anger checked her panic. She straightened up with what composure this surprise had left her
and started for the door. But the cowboy barred her passage--grasped her arms. Then Madeline
divined that her brother could not have any knowledge of this indignity. It was no trick. It
was something that was happening, that was real, that threatened she knew not what. She tried
to wrench free, feeling hot all over at being handled by this drunken brute. Him look ordinary, however,
it drink to be the remark that many words meet it had of blood. Don state: "of silence did she had
free up strength as she must not have to see her out to word, and particularly as his view and the

"Meaning you'll not run from Al Hammond? Gene, your skull is as thick as an old cow's. Al will
never know anything about what you did to his sister unless you tell him. And if you do that
he'll shoot you. She won't give you away. She's a thoroughbred. Why, she was so white last
night I thought she'd drop at my feet, but she never blinked an eyelash. I'm a woman, Gene
Stewart and if I couldn't feel like Miss Hammond I know how awful an ordeal she must have had.
Why, she's one of the most beautiful, the most sought after, the most exclusive women in New
York City. There's a crowd of millionaires and lords and dukes after her. How terrible it'd
be for a woman like her to be kissed by a drunken cowpuncher! I say it--"

"Flo, I never insulted her that way," broke out Stewart.

"It was worse, then?" she queried, sharply.

"I made a bet that I'd marry the first girl who came to town. I was on the watch and pretty
drunk. When she came--well, I got Padre Marcos and tried to bully her into marrying me."

"Oh, Lord!" Florence gasped. "It's worse than I feared.... Gene, Al will kill you."

"That'll be a good thing," replied the cowboy, dejectedly.

"Gene Stewart, it certainly would, unless you turn over a new leaf," retorted Florence. "But
don't be a fool." And here she became earnest and appealing. "Go away, Gene. Go join the rebels
across the border--you're always threatening that. Anyhow, don't stay here and run any chance
of stirring Al up. He'd kill you just the same as you would kill another man for insulting
your sister. Don't make trouble for Al. That'd only make sorrow for her, Gene."

The subtle import was not lost upon Madeline. She was distressed because she could not avoid
hearing what was not meant for her ears. She made an effort not to listen, and it was futile.

"Flo, you can't see this a man's way," he replied, quietly. "I'll stay and take my medicine."

"Gene, I could sure swear at you or any other pig-head of a cowboy. Listen. My brother-in-law,
Jack, heard something of what I said to you last night. He doesn't like you. I'm afraid he'll
tell Al. For Heaven's sake, man, go down-town and shut him up and yourself, too."

Then Madeline heard her come into the house and presently rap on the door and call softly:

"Miss Hammond. Are you awake?"

"Awake and dressed, Miss Kingsley. Come in."

"Oh! You've rested. You look so--so different. I'm sure glad. Come out now. We'll have breakfast,
and then you may expect to meet your brother any moment."

"Wait, please. I heard you speaking to Mr. Stewart. It was unavoidable. But I am glad. I must
see him. Will you please ask him to come into the parlor a moment?"

"Yes," replied Florence, quickly; and as she turned at the door she flashed at Madeline a woman's
meaning glance. "Make him keep his mouth shut!"

Presently there were slow, reluctant steps outside the front door, then a pause, and the door
opened. Stewart stood bareheaded in the sunlight. Madeline remembered with a kind of shudder
the tall form, the embroidered buckskin vest, the red scarf, the bright leather wristbands,
the wide silver-buckled belt and chaps. Her glance seemed to run over him swift as lightning.
But as she saw his face now she did not recognize it. The man's presence roused in her a revolt.
Yet something in her, the incomprehensible side of her nature, thrilled in the look of this
splendid dark-faced barbarian.

"Mr. Stewart, will you please come in?" she asked, after that long pause.

"I reckon not," he said. The hopelessness of his tone meant that he knew he was not fit to
enter a room with her, and did not care or cared too much.

Madeline went to the door. The man's face was hard, yet it was sad, too. And it touched her.

"I shall not tell my brother of your--your rudeness to me," she began. It was impossible for
her to keep the chill out of her voice, to speak with other than the pride and aloofness of
her class. Nevertheless, despite her loathing, when she had spoken so far it seemed that kindness
and pity followed involuntarily. "I choose to overlook what you did because you were not wholly
accountable, and because there must be no trouble between Alfred and you. May I rely on you
to keep silence and to seal the lips of that priest? And you know there was a man killed or
injured there last night. I want to forget that dreadful thing. I don't want it known that
I heard--"

"The Greaser didn't die," interrupted Stewart.

"Ah! then that's not so bad, after all. I am glad for the sake of your friend--the little Mexican
girl."

A slow scarlet wave overspread his face, and his shame was painful to see. That fixed in Madeline's
mind a conviction that if he was a heathen he was not wholly bad. And it made so much difference
that she smiled down at him.

"You will spare me further distress, will you not, please?" His hoarse reply was incoherent,
but she needed only to see his working face to know his remorse and gratitude.

Madeline went back to her room; and presently Florence came for her, and directly they were
sitting at breakfast. Madeline Hammond's impression of her brother's friend had to be reconstructed
in the morning light. She felt a wholesome, frank, sweet nature. She liked the slow Southern
drawl. And she was puzzled to know whether Florence Kingsley was pretty or striking or unusual.
She had a youthful glow and flush, the clear tan of outdoors, a face that lacked the soft curves
and lines of Eastern women, and her eyes were light gray, like crystal, steady, almost piercing,
and her hair was a beautiful bright, waving mass.

Florence's sister was the elder of the two, a stout woman with a strong face and quiet eyes.
It was a simple fare and service they gave to their guest; but they made no apologies for that.
Indeed, Madeline felt their simplicity to be restful. She was sated with respect, sick of admiration,
tired of adulation; and it was good to see that these Western women treated her as very likely
they would have treated any other visitor. They were sweet, kind; and what Madeline had at
first thought was a lack of expression or vitality she soon discovered to be the natural reserve
of women who did not live superficial lives. Florence was breezy and frank, her sister quaint
and not given much to speech. Madeline thought she would like to have these women near her
if she were ill or in trouble. And she reproached herself for a fastidiousness, a hypercritical
sense of refinement that could not help distinguishing what these women lacked.

"Can you ride?" Florence was asking. "That's what a Westerner always asks any one from the
East. Can you ride like a man--astride, I mean? Oh, that's fine. You look strong enough to
hold a horse. We have some fine horses out here. I reckon when Al comes we'll go out to Bill
Stillwell's ranch. We'll have to go, whether we want to or not, for when Bill learns you are
here he'll just pack us all off. You'll love old Bill. His ranch is run down, but the range
and the rides up in the mountains--they are beautiful. We'll hunt and climb, and most of all
we'll ride. I love a horse--I love the wind in my face, and a wide stretch with the mountains
beckoning. You must have the best horse on the ranges. And that means a scrap between Al and
Bill and all the cowboys. We don't all agree about horses, except in case of Gene Stewart's
iron-gray."

"Does Mr. Stewart own the best horse in the country?" asked Madeline. Again she had an inexplicable
thrill as she remembered the wild flight of Stewart's big dark steed and rider.

"Yes, and that's all he does own," replied Florence. "Gene can't keep even a quirt. But he
sure loves that horse and calls him--"

At this juncture a sharp knock on the parlor door interrupted the conversation. Florence's
sister went to open it. She returned presently and said:

"It's Gene. He's been dawdlin' out there on the front porch, and he knocked to let us know
Miss Hammond's brother is comin'."

Florence hurried into the parlor, followed by Madeline. The door stood open, and disclosed
Stewart sitting on the porch steps. From down the road came a clatter of hoofs. Madeline looked
out over Florence's shoulder and saw a cloud of dust approaching, and in it she distinguished
outlines of horses and riders. A warmth spread over her, a little tingle of gladness, and the
feeling recalled her girlish love for her brother. What would he be like after long years?

"Gene, has Jack kept his mouth shut?" queried Florence; and again Madeline was aware of a sharp
ring in the girl's voice.

"No," replied Stewart.

"Gene! You won't let it come to a fight? Al can be managed. But Jack hates you and he'll have
his friends with him."

"There won't be any fight."

"Use your brains now," added Florence; and then she turned to push Madeline gently back into
the parlor.

Madeline's glow of warmth changed to a blank dismay. Was she to see her brother act with the
violence she now associated with cowboys? The clatter of hoofs stopped before the door. Looking
out, Madeline saw a bunch of dusty, wiry horses pawing the gravel and tossing lean heads. Her
swift glance ran over the lithe horsemen, trying to pick out the one who was her brother. But
she could not. Her glance, however, caught the same rough dress and hard aspect that characterized
the cowboy Stewart. Then one rider threw his bridle, leaped from the saddle, and came bounding
up the porch steps. Florence met him at the door.

"Hello, Flo. Where is she?" he called, eagerly. With that he looked over her shoulder to espy
Madeline. He actually jumped at her. She hardly knew the tall form and the bronzed face, but
the warm flash of blue eyes was familiar. As for him, he had no doubt of his sister, it appeared,
for with broken welcome he threw his arms around her, then held her off and looked searchingly
at her.

"Well, sister," he began, when Florence turned hurriedly from the door and interrupted him.

"Al, I think you'd better stop the wrangling out there." He stared at her, appeared suddenly
to hear the loud voices from the street, and then, releasing Madeline, he said:

"By George! I forgot, Flo. There is a little business to see to. Keep my sister in here, please,
and don't be fussed up now."

He went out on the porch and called to his men:

"Shut off your wind, Jack! And you, too, Blaze! I didn't want you fellows to come here. But
as you would come, you've got to shut up. This is my business."

Whereupon he turned to Stewart, who was sitting on the fence.

"Hello, Stewart!" he said.

It was a greeting; but there was that in the voice which alarmed Madeline.

Stewart leisurely got up and leisurely advanced to the porch.

"Hello, Hammond!" he drawled.

"Drunk again last night?"

"Well, if you want to know, and if it's any of your mix, yes, I was-pretty drunk," replied Stewart.

It was a kind of cool speech that showed the cowboy in control of himself and master of the
situation--not an easy speech to follow up with undue inquisitiveness. There was a short silence.

"Damn it, Stewart," said the speaker, presently, "here's the situation: It's all over town
that you met my sister last night at the station and--and insulted her. Jack's got it in for
you, so have these other boys. But it's my affair. Understand, I didn't fetch them here. They
can see you square yourself, or else--Gene, you've been on the wrong trail for some time, drinking
and all that. You're going to the bad. But Bill thinks, and I think, you're still a man. We
never knew you to lie. Now what have you to say for yourself?"

"Nobody is insinuating that I am a liar?" drawled Stewart.

"No."

"Well, I'm glad to hear that. You see, Al, I was pretty drunk last night, but not drunk enough
to forget the least thing I did. I told Pat Hawe so this morning when he was curious. And that's
polite for me to be to Pat. Well, I found Miss Hammond waiting alone at the station. She wore
a veil, but I knew she was a lady, of course. I imagine, now that I think of it, that Miss
Hammond found my gallantry rather startling, and--"

At this point Madeline, answering to unconsidered impulse, eluded Florence and walked out upon
the porch.

Sombreros flashed down and the lean horses jumped.

"Gentlemen," said Madeline, rather breathlessly; and it did not add to her calmness to feel
a hot flush in her cheeks, "I am very new to Western ways, but I think you are laboring under
a mistake, which, in justice to Mr. Stewart, I want to correct. Indeed, he was rather--rather
abrupt and strange when he came up to me last night; but as I understand him now, I can attribute
that to his gallantry. He was somewhat wild and sudden and--sentimental in his demand to protect
me--and it was not clear whether he meant his protection for last night or forever; but I am
happy to say be offered me no word that was not honorable. And he saw me safely here to Miss
Kingsley's home."

III. Sister and Brother

Then Madeline returned to the little parlor with the brother whom she had hardly recognized.

"Majesty!" he exclaimed. "To think of your being here!"

The warmth stole back along her veins. She remembered how that pet name had sounded from the
lips of this brother who had given it to her.

"Alfred!"

Then his words of gladness at sight of her, his chagrin at not being at the train to welcome
her, were not so memorable of him as the way he clasped her, for he had held her that way the
day he left home, and she had not forgotten. But now he was so much taller and bigger, so dusty
and strange and different and forceful, that she could scarcely think him the same man. She
even had a humorous thought that here was another cowboy bullying her, and this time it was
her brother.

"Dear old girl," he said, more calmly, as he let her go, "you haven't changed at all, except
to grow lovelier. Only you're a woman now, and you've fulfilled the name I gave you. God! how
sight of you brings back home! It seems a hundred years since I left. I missed you more than
all the rest."

Madeline seemed to feel with his every word that she was remembering him. She was so amazed
at the change in him that she could not believe her eyes. She saw a bronzed, strong-jawed,
eagle-eyed man, stalwart, superb of height, and, like the cowboys, belted, booted, spurred.
And there was something hard as iron in his face that quivered with his words. It seemed that
only in those moments when the hard lines broke and softened could she see resemblance to the
face she remembered. It was his manner, the tone of his voice, and the tricks of speech that
proved to her he was really Alfred. She had bidden good-by to a disgraced, disinherited, dissolute
boy. Well she remembered the handsome pale face with its weakness and shadows and careless
smile, with the ever-present cigarette hanging between the lips. The years had passed, and
now she saw him a man--the West had made him a man. And Madeline Hammond felt a strong, passionate
gladness and gratefulness, and a direct check to her suddenly inspired hatred of the West.

"Majesty, it was good of you to come. I'm all broken up. How did you ever do it? But never
mind that now. Tell me about that brother of mine."

And Madeline told him, and then about their sister Helen. Question after question he fired
at her; and she told him of her mother; of Aunt Grace, who had died a year ago; of his old
friends, married, scattered, vanished. But she did not tell him of his father, for he did not ask.

Quite suddenly the rapid-fire questioning ceased; he choked, was silent a moment, and then
burst into tears. It seemed to her that a long, stored-up bitterness was flooding away. It
hurt her to see him--hurt her more to hear him. And in the succeeding few moments she grew
closer to him than she had ever been in the past. Had her father and mother done right by him?
Her pulse stirred with unwonted quickness. She did not speak, but she kissed him, which, for
her, was an indication of unusual feeling. And when he recovered command over his emotions
he made no reference to his breakdown, nor did she. But that scene struck deep into Madeline
Hammond's heart. Through it she saw what he had lost and gained.

"Alfred, why did you not answer my last letters?" asked Madeline. "I had not heard from you
for two years."

"So long? How time flies! Well, things went bad with me about the last time I heard from you.
I always intended to write some day, but I never did."

"Things went wrong? Tell me."

"Majesty, you mustn't worry yourself with my troubles. I want you to enjoy your stay and not
be bothered with my difficulties."

"Please tell me. I suspected something had gone wrong. That is partly why I decided to come out."

"All right; if you must know," he began; and it seemed to Madeline that there was a gladness
in his decision to unburden himself. "You remember all about my little ranch, and that for
a while I did well raising stock? I wrote you all that. Majesty, a man makes enemies anywhere.
Perhaps an Eastern man in the West can make, if not so many, certainly more bitter ones. At
any rate, I made several. There was a cattleman, Ward by name--he's gone now--and he and I
had trouble over cattle. That gave me a back-set. Pat Hawe, the sheriff here, has been instrumental
in hurting my business. He's not so much of a rancher, but he has influence at Santa Fe and
El Paso and Douglas. I made an enemy of him. I never did anything to him. He hates Gene Stewart,
and upon one occasion I spoiled a little plot of his to get Gene in his clutches. The real
reason for his animosity toward me is that he loves Florence, and Florence is going to marry me."

"Alfred!"

"What's the matter, Majesty? Didn't Florence impress you favorably?" he asked, with a keen glance.

"Why--yes, indeed. I like her. But I did not think of her in relation to you--that way. I am
greatly surprised. Alfred, is she well born? What connections?"

"Florence is just a girl of ordinary people. She was born in Kentucky, was brought up in Texas.
My aristocratic and wealthy family would scorn--"

"Alfred, you are still a Hammond," said Madeline, with uplifted head.

Alfred laughed. "We won't quarrel, Majesty. I remember you, and in spite of your pride you've
got a heart. If you stay here a month you'll love Florence Kingsley. I want you to know she's
had a great deal to do with straightening me up.... Well, to go on with my story. There's Don
Carlos, a Mexican rancher, and he's my worst enemy. For that matter, he's as bad an enemy of
Bill Stillwell and other ranchers. Stillwell, by the way, is my friend and one of the finest
men on earth. I got in debt to Don Carlos before I knew he was so mean. In the first place
I lost money at faro--I gambled some when I came West--and then I made unwise cattle deals.
Don Carlos is a wily Greaser, he knows the ranges, he has the water, and he is dishonest. So
he outfigured me. And now I am practically ruined. He has not gotten possession of my ranch,
but that's only a matter of time, pending lawsuits at Santa Fe. At present I have a few hundred
cattle running on Stillwell's range, and I am his foreman."

"Foreman?" queried Madeline.

"I am simply boss of Stillwell's cowboys, and right glad of my job."

Madeline was conscious of an inward burning. It required an effort for her to retain her outward
tranquillity. Annoying consciousness she had also of the returning sense of new disturbing
emotions. She began to see just how walled in from unusual thought-provoking incident and sensation
had been her exclusive life.

"Cannot your property be reclaimed?" she asked. "How much do you owe?"

"Ten thousand dollars would clear me and give me another start. But, Majesty, in this country
that's a good deal of money, and I haven't been able to raise it. Stillwell's in worse shape
than I am."

Madeline went over to Alfred and put her hands on his shoulders.

"We must not be in debt."

He stared at her as if her words had recalled something long forgotten. Then he smiled.

"How imperious you are! I'd forgotten just who my beautiful sister really is. Majesty, you're
not going to ask me to take money from you?"

"I am."

"Well, I'll not do it. I never did, even when I was in college, and then there wasn't much
beyond me."

"Listen, Alfred," she went on, earnestly, "this is entirely different. I had only an allowance
then. You had no way to know that since I last wrote you I had come into my inheritance from
Aunt Grace. It was--well, that doesn't matter. Only, I haven't been able to spend half the
income. It's mine. It's not father's money. You will make me very happy if you'll consent.
Alfred, I'm so--so amazed at the change in you. I'm so happy. You must never take a backward
step from now on. What is ten thousand dollars to me? Sometimes I spend that in a month. I
throw money away. If you let me help you it will be doing me good as well as you. Please, Alfred."

He kissed her, evidently surprised at her earnestness. And indeed Madeline was surprised herself.
Once started, her speech had flowed.

"You always were the best of fellows, Majesty. And if you really care--if you really want to
help me I'll be only too glad to accept. It will be fine. Florence will go wild. And that Greaser
won't harass me any more. Majesty, pretty soon some titled fellow will be spending your money;
I may as well take a little before he gets it all," he finished, jokingly.

"What do you know about me?" she asked, lightly.

"More than you think. Even if we are lost out here in the woolly West we get news. Everybody
knows about Anglesbury. And that Dago duke who chased you all over Europe, that Lord Castleton
has the running now and seems about to win. How about it, Majesty?"

Madeline detected a hint that suggested scorn in his gay speech. And deep in his searching
glance she saw a flame. She became thoughtful. She had forgotten Castleton, New York, society.

"Alfred," she began, seriously, "I don't believe any titled gentleman will ever spend my money,
as you elegantly express it."

"I don't care for that. It's you!" he cried, passionately, and he grasped her with a violence
that startled her. He was white; his eyes were now like fire. "You are so splendid--so wonderful.
People called you the American Beauty, but you're more than that. You're the American Girl!
Majesty, marry no man unless you love him, and love an American. Stay away from Europe long
enough to learn to know the men--the real men of your own country."

"Alfred, I'm afraid there are not always real men and real love for American girls in international
marriages. But Helen knows this. It'll be her choice. She'll be miserable if she marries Anglesbury."

"It'll serve her just right," declared her brother. "Helen was always crazy for glitter, adulation,
fame. I'll gamble she never saw more of Anglesbury than the gold and ribbons on his breast."

"I am sorry. Anglesbury is a gentleman; but it is the money he wanted, I think. Alfred, tell
me how you came to know about me, 'way out here? You may be assured I was astonished to find
that Miss Kingsley knew me as Majesty Hammond."

"I imagine it was a surprise," he replied, with a laugh, "I told Florence about you--gave her
a picture of you. And, of course, being a woman, she showed the picture and talked. She's in
love with you. Then, my dear sister, we do get New York papers out here occasionally, and we
can see and read. You may not be aware that you and your society friends are objects of intense
interest in the U. S. in general, and the West in particular. The papers are full of you, and
perhaps a lot of things you never did."

"That Mr. Stewart knew, too. He said, 'You're not Majesty Hammond?'"

"Never mind his impudence!" exclaimed Alfred; and then again he laughed. "Gene is all right,
only you've got to know him. I'll tell you what he did. He got hold of one of those newspaper
pictures of you--the one in the Times; he took it away from here, and in spite of Florence
he wouldn't fetch it back. It was a picture of you in riding-habit with your blue-ribbon horse,
White Stockings--remember? It was taken at Newport. Well, Stewart tacked the picture up in
his bunk-house and named his beautiful horse Majesty. All the cowboys knew it. They would see
the picture and tease him unmercifully. But he didn't care. One day I happened to drop in on
him and found him just recovering from a carouse. I saw the picture, too, and I said to him,
'Gene, if my sister knew you were a drunkard she'd not be proud of having her picture stuck
up in your room.' Majesty, he did not touch a drop for a month, and when he did drink again
he took the picture down, and he has never put it back."

Madeline smiled at her brother's amusement, but she did not reply. She simply could not adjust
herself to these queer free Western' ways. Her brother had eloquently pleaded for her to keep
herself above a sordid and brilliant marriage, yet he not only allowed a cowboy to keep her
picture in his room, but actually spoke of her and used her name in a temperance lecture. Madeline
just escaped feeling disgust. She was saved from this, however, by nothing less than her brother's
naive gladness that through subtle suggestion Stewart had been persuaded to be good for a month.
Something made up of Stewart's effrontery to her; of Florence Kingsley meeting her, frankly
as it were, as an equal; of the elder sister's slow, quiet, easy acceptance of this visitor
who had been honored at the courts of royalty; of that faint hint of scorn in Alfred's voice,
and his amused statement in regard to her picture and the name Majesty--something made up of
all these stung Madeline Hammond's pride, alienated her for an instant, and then stimulated
her intelligence, excited her interest, and made her resolve to learn a little about this incomprehensible
West.

"Majesty, I must run down to the siding," he said, consulting his watch. "We're loading a shipment
of cattle. I'll be back by supper-time and bring Stillwell with me. You'll like him. Give me
the check for your trunk."

She went into the little bedroom and, taking up her bag, she got out a number of checks.

"Six! Six trunks!" he exclaimed. "Well, I'm very glad you intend to stay awhile. Say, Majesty,
it will take me as long to realize who you really are as it'll take to break you of being a
tenderfoot. I hope you packed a riding-suit. If not you'll have to wear trousers! You'll have
to do that, anyway, when we go up in the mountains."

"No!"

"You sure will, as Florence says."

"We shall see about that. I don't know what's in the trunks. I never pack anything. My dear
brother, what do I have maids for?"

"How did it come that you didn't travel with a maid?"

"I wanted to be alone. But don't you worry. I shall be able to look after myself. I dare say
it will be good for me."

She went to the gate with him.

"What a shaggy, dusty horse! He's wild, too. Do you let him stand that way without being haltered?
I should think he would run off."

"Tenderfoot! You'll be great fun, Majesty, especially for the cowboys."

"Oh, will I?" she asked, constrainedly.

"Yes, and in three days they will be fighting one another over you. That's going to worry me.
Cowboys fall in love with a plain woman, an ugly woman, any woman, so long as she's young.
And you! Good Lord! They'll go out of their heads."

"You are pleased to be facetious, Alfred. I think I have had quite enough of cowboys, and I
haven't been here twenty-four hours."

"Don't think too much of first impressions. That was my mistake when I arrived here. Good-by.
I'll go now. Better rest awhile. You look tired."

The horse started as Alfred put his foot in the stirrup and was running when the rider slipped
his leg over the saddle. Madeline watched him in admiration. He seemed to be loosely fitted
to the saddle, moving with the horse.

"I suppose that's a cowboy's style. It pleases me," she said. "How different from the seat
of Eastern riders!"

Then Madeline sat upon the porch and fell to interested observation of her surrounding. Near
at hand it was decidedly not prepossessing. The street was deep in dust, and the cool wind
whipped up little puffs. The houses along this street were all low, square, flat-roofed structures
made of some kind of red cement. It occurred to her suddenly that this building-material must
be the adobe she had read about. There was no person in sight. The long street appeared to
have no end, though the line of houses did not extend far. Once she heard a horse trotting
at some distance, and several times the ringing of a locomotive bell. Where were the mountains,
wondered Madeline. Soon low over the house-roofs she saw a dim, dark-blue, rugged outline.
It seemed to charm her eyes and fix her gaze. She knew the Adirondacks, she had seen the Alps
from the summit of Mont Blanc, and had stood under the great black, white-tipped shadow of
the Himalayas. But they had not drawn her as these remote Rockies. This dim horizon line boldly
cutting the blue sky fascinated her. Florence Kingsley's expression "beckoning mountains" returned
to Madeline. She could not see or feel so much as that. Her impression was rather that these
mountains were aloof, unattainable, that if approached they would recede or vanish like the
desert mirage.

Madeline went to her room, intending to rest awhile, and she fell asleep. She was aroused by
Florence's knock and call.

"Miss Hammond, your brother has come back with Stillwell."

"Why, how I have slept!" exclaimed Madeline. "It's nearly six o'clock."

"I'm sure glad. You were tired. And the air here makes strangers sleepy. Come, we want you
to meet old Bill. He calls himself the last of the cattlemen. He has lived in Texas and here
all his life."

Madeline accompanied Florence to the porch. Her brother, who was sitting near the door, jumped
up and said:

"Hello, Majesty!" And as he put his arm around her he turned toward a massive man whose broad,
craggy face began to ripple and wrinkle. "I want to introduce my friend Stillwell to you. Bill,
this is my sister, the sister I've so often told you about--Majesty."

"Wal, wal, Al, this's the proudest meetin' of my life," replied Stillwell, in a booming voice.
He extended a huge hand. "Miss--Miss Majesty, sight of you is as welcome as the rain an' the
flowers to an old desert cattleman."

Madeline greeted him, and it was all she could do to repress a cry at the way he crunched her
hand in a grasp of iron. He was old, white-haired, weather-beaten, with long furrows down his
checks and with gray eyes almost hidden in wrinkles. If he was smiling she fancied it a most
extraordinary smile. The next instant she realized that it had been a smile, for his face appeared
to stop rippling, the light died, and suddenly it was like rudely chiseled stone. The quality
of hardness she had seen in Stewart was immeasurably intensified in this old man's face.

"Miss Majesty, it's plumb humiliatin' to all of us thet we wasn't on hand to meet you," Stillwell
said. "Me an' Al stepped into the P. O. an' said a few mild an' cheerful things. Them messages
ought to hev been sent out to the ranch. I'm sure afraid it was a bit unpleasant fer you last
night at the station."

"I was rather anxious at first and perhaps frightened," replied Madeline.

"Wal, I'm some glad to tell you thet there's no man in these parts except your brother thet
I'd as lief hev met you as Gene Stewart."

"Indeed?"

"Yes, an' thet's takin' into consideration Gene's weakness, too. I'm allus fond of sayin' of
myself thet I'm the last of the old cattlemen. Wal, Stewart's not a native Westerner, but he's
my pick of the last of the cowboys. Sure, he's young, but he's the last of the old style--the
picturesque--an' chivalrous, too, I make bold to say, Miss Majesty, as well as the old hard-ridin'
kind. Folks are down on Stewart. An' I'm only sayin' a good word for him because he is down,
an' mebbe last night he might hev scared you, you bein' fresh from the East."

Madeline liked the old fellow for his loyalty to the cowboy he evidently cared for; but as
there did not seem anything for her to say, she remained silent.

"Miss Majesty, the day of the cattleman is about over. An' the day of the cowboy, such as Gene
Stewart, is over. There's no place for Gene. If these weren't modern days he'd come near bein'
a gun-man, same as we had in Texas, when I ranched there in the 'seventies. But he can't fit
nowhere now; he can't hold a job, an' he's goin' down."

"I am sorry to hear it," murmured Madeline. "But, Mr. Stillwell, aren't these modern days out
here just a little wild--yet? The conductor on my train told me of rebels, bandits, raiders.
Then I have had other impressions of--well, that were wild enough for me."

"Wal, it's some more pleasant an' excitin' these days than for many years," replied Stillwell.
"The boys hev took to packin' guns again. But thet's owin' to the revolution in Mexico. There's
goin' to be trouble along the border. I reckon people in the East don't know there is a revolution.
Wal, Madero will oust Diaz, an' then some other rebel will oust Madero. It means trouble on
the border an' across the border, too. I wouldn't wonder if Uncle Sam hed to get a hand in
the game. There's already been holdups on the railroads an' raids along the Rio Grande Valley.
An' these little towns are full of Greasers, all disturbed by the fightin' down in Mexico.
We've been hevin' shootin'-scrapes an' knifin'-scrapes, an' some cattle-raidin'. I hev been
losin' a few cattle right along. Reminds me of old times; an' pretty soon if it doesn't stop,
I'll take the old-time way to stop it."

"Yes, indeed, Majesty," put in Alfred, "you have hit upon an interesting time to visit us."

"Wal, thet sure 'pears to be so," rejoined Stillwell. "Stewart got in trouble down heah to-day,
an' I'm more than sorry to hev to tell you thet your name figgered in it. But I couldn't blame
him, fer I sure would hev done the same myself."

"That so?" queried Alfred, laughing. "Well, tell us about it."

Madeline simply gazed at her brother, and, though he seemed amused at her consternation, there
was mortification in his face.

It required no great perspicuity, Madeline thought, to see that Stillwell loved to talk, and
the way he squared himself and spread his huge hands over his knees suggested that he meant
to do this opportunity justice.

"Miss Majesty, I reckon, bein' as you're in the West now, thet you must take things as they
come, an' mind each thing a little less than the one before. If we old fellers hedn't been
thet way we'd never hev lasted.

"Last night wasn't particular bad, ratin' with some other nights lately. There wasn't much
doin'. But, I had a hard knock. Yesterday when we started in with a bunch of cattle I sent
one of my cowboys, Danny Mains, along ahead, carryin' money I hed to pay off hands an' my bills,
an' I wanted thet money to get in town before dark. Wal, Danny was held up. I don't distrust
the lad. There's been strange Greasers in town lately, an' mebbe they knew about the money comin'.

"Wal, when I arrived with the cattle I was some put to it to make ends meet. An' to-day I wasn't
in no angelic humor. When I hed my business all done I went around pokin' my nose beak an'
there, tryin' to get scent of thet money. An' I happened in at a hall we hev thet does duty
fer' jail an' hospital an' election-post an' what not. Wal, just then it was doin' duty as
a hospital. Last night was fiesta night--these Greasers hev a fiesta every week or so--an'
one Greaser who hed been bad hurt was layin' in the hall, where he hed been fetched from the
station. Somebody hed sent off to Douglas fer a doctor, but be hedn't come yet. I've hed some
experience with gunshot wounds, an' I looked this feller over. He wasn't shot up much, but
I thought there was danger of blood-poison-in'. Anyway, I did all I could.

"The hall was full of cowboys, ranchers, Greasers, miners, an' town folks, along with some
strangers. I was about to get started up this way when Pat Hawe come in.

"Pat he's the sheriff. I reckon, Miss Majesty, thet sheriffs are new to you, an' fer sake of
the West I'll explain to you thet we don't hev many of the real thing any more. Garrett, who
killed Billy the Kid an' was killed himself near a year or so ago--he was the kind of sheriff
thet helps to make a self-respectin' country. But this Pat Hawe--wal, I reckon there's no good
in me sayin' what I think of him. He come into the hall, an' he was roarin' about things. He
was goin' to arrest Danny Mains on sight. Wal, I jest polite-like told Pat thet the money was
mine an' he needn't get riled about it. An' if I wanted to trail the thief I reckon I could
do it as well as anybody. Pat howled thet law was law, an' he was goin' to lay down the law.
Sure it 'peared to me thet Pat was daid set to arrest the first man he could find excuse to.

"Then he cooled down a bit an' was askin' questions about the wounded Greaser when Gene Stewart
come in. Whenever Pat an' Gene come together it reminds me of the early days back in the 'seventies.
Jest naturally everybody shut up. Fer Pat hates Gene, an' I reckon Gene ain't very sweet on
Pat. They're jest natural foes in the first place, an' then the course of events here in El
Cajon has been aggravatin'.

"'Hello, Stewart! You're the feller I'm lookin' fer,' said Pat.

"Stewart eyed him an' said, mighty cool an' sarcastic, 'Hawe, you look a good deal fer me when
I'm hittin' up the dust the other way.'

"Pat went red at thet, but he held in. 'Say, Stewart, you-all think a lot of thet roan horse
of yourn, with the aristocratic name?'

"'I reckon I do,' replied Gene, shortly.

"'Wal, where is he?'

"'Thet's none of your business, Hawe.'

"'Oho! it ain't, hey? Wal, I guess I can make it my business. Stewart, there was some queer
goings-on last night thet you know somethin' about. Danny Mains robbed--Stillwell's money gone--your
roan horse gone--thet little hussy Bonita gone--an' this Greaser near gone, too. Now, seein'
thet you was up late an' prowlin' round the station where this Greaser was found, it ain't
onreasonable to think you might know how he got plugged--is it?'

"Stewart laughed kind of cold, an' he rolled a cigarette, all the time eyin' Pat, an' then
he said if he'd plugged the Greaser it 'd never hev been sich a bunglin' job.

"'I can arrest you on suspicion, Stewart, but before I go thet far I want some evidence. I
want to round up Danny Mains an' thet little Greaser girl. I want to find out what's become
of your hoss. You've never lent him since you hed him, an' there ain't enough raiders across
the border to steal him from you. It's got a queer look--thet hoss bein' gone.'

"'You sure are a swell detective, Hawe, an' I wish you a heap of luck,' replied Stewart.

"Thet 'peared to nettle Pat beyond bounds, an' he stamped around an' swore. Then he had an
idea. It jest stuck out all over him, an' he shook his finger in Stewart's face.

"'You was drunk last night?'

"Stewart never batted an eye.

"'You met some woman on Number Eight, didn't you?' shouted Hawe.

"'I met a lady,' replied Stewart, quiet an' menacin' like.

"'You met Al Hammond's sister, an' you took her up to Kingsley's. An' cinch this, my cowboy
cavalier, I'm goin' up there an' ask this grand dame some questions, an' if she's as close-mouthed
as you are I'll arrest her!'

"Gene Stewart turned white. I fer one expected to see him jump like lightnin', as he does when
he's riled sudden. But he was calm an' he was thinkin' hard. Presently he said:

"'Pat, thet's a fool idee, an' if you do the trick it'll hurt you all the rest of your life.
There's absolutely no reason to frighten Miss Hammond. An' tryin' to arrest her would be such
a damned outrage as won't be stood fer in El Cajon. If you're sore on me send me to jail. I'll
go. If you want to hurt Al Hammond, go an' do it some man kind of way. Don't take your spite
out on us by insultin' a lady who has come hyar to hev a little visit. We're bad enough without
bein' low-down as Greasers.'

"It was a long talk for Gene, an' I was as surprised as the rest of the fellers. Think of Gene
Stewart talkin' soft an' sweet to thet red-eyed coyote of a sheriff! An' Pat, he looked so
devilishly gleeful thet if somethin' about Gene hedn't held me tight I'd hev got in the game
my-self. It was plain to me an' others who spoke of it afterwards thet Pat Hawe hed forgotten
the law an' the officer in the man an' his hate.

"'I'm a-goin', an' I'm a-goin' right now!' he shouted. "An' after thet any one could hev heerd
a clock tick a mile off. Stewart seemed kind of chokin', an' he seemed to hev been bewildered
by the idee of Hawe's confrontin' you.

"An' finally he burst out: 'But, man, think who it is! It's Miss Hammond! If you seen her,
even if you was locoed or drunk, you--you couldn't do it.'

"'Couldn't I? Wal, I'll show you damn quick. What do I care who she is? Them swell Eastern
women--I've heerd of them. They're not so much. This Hammond woman--'

"Suddenly Hawe shut up, an' with his red mug turnin' green he went for his gun."

Stillwell paused in his narrative to get breath, and he wiped his moist brow. And now his face
began to lose its cragginess. It changed, it softened, it rippled and wrinkled, and all that
strange mobility focused and shone in a wonderful smile.

"An' then, Miss Majesty, then there was somethin' happened. Stewart took Pat's gun away from
him and throwed it on the floor. An' what followed was beautiful. Sure it was the beautifulest
sight I ever seen. Only it was over so soon! A little while after, when the doctor came, he
hed another patient besides the wounded Greaser, an' he said thet this new one would require
about four months to be up an' around cheerful-like again. An' Gene Stewart hed hit the trail
for the border."

IV. A Ride From Sunrise To Sunset

Next morning, when Madeline was aroused by her brother, it was not yet daybreak; the air chilled
her, and in the gray gloom she had to feel around for matches and lamp. Her usual languid manner
vanished at a touch of the cold water. Presently, when Alfred knocked on her door and said
he was leaving a pitcher of hot water outside, she replied, with chattering teeth, "Th-thank
y-you, b-but I d-don't ne-need any now." She found it necessary, however, to warm her numb
fingers before she could fasten hooks and buttons. And when she was dressed she marked in the
dim mirror that there were tinges of red in her cheeks.

"Well, if I haven't some color!" she exclaimed.

Breakfast waited for her in the dining-room. The sisters ate with her. Madeline quickly caught
the feeling of brisk action that seemed to be in the air. From the back of the house sounded
the tramp of boots and voices of men, and from outside came a dull thump of hoofs, the rattle
of harness, and creak of wheels. Then Alfred came stamping in.

"Majesty, here's where you get the real thing," he announced, merrily. "We're rushing you off,
I'm sorry to say; but we must hustle back to the ranch. The fall round-up begins to-morrow.
You will ride in the buck-board with Florence and Stillwell. I'll ride on ahead with the boys
and fix up a little for you at the ranch. Your baggage will follow, but won't get there till
to-morrow sometime. It's a long ride out--nearly fifty miles by wagon-road. Flo, don't forget
a couple of robes. Wrap her up well. And hustle getting ready. We're waiting."

A little later, when Madeline went out with Florence, the gray gloom was lightening. Horses
were champing bits and pounding gravel.

"Mawnin', Miss Majesty," said Stillwell, gruffly, from the front seat of a high vehicle. 

Impudently be on page 170 we find Who Galotti name up the "Who," and mind down on page-- this citation

 The wind appeared to penetrate the robes. It was
cold, pure, nipping. It was so thin she had to breathe as fast as if she were under ordinary
exertion. It hurt her nose and made her lungs ache.

"Aren't you co-cold?" asked Madeline.

"I?" Florence laughed. "I'm used to it. I never get cold."

The Western girl sat with ungloved hands on the outside of the robe she evidently did not need
to draw up around her. Madeline thought she had never seen such a clear-eyed, healthy, splendid
girl.

"Do you like to see the sun rise?" asked Florence.

"Yes, I think I do," replied Madeline, thoughtfully. "Frankly, I have not seen it for years."

"We have beautiful sunrises, and sunsets from the ranch are glorious."

Long lines of pink fire ran level with the eastern horizon, which appeared to recede as day
brightened. A bank of thin, fleecy clouds was turning rose. To the south and west the sky was
dark; but every moment it changed, the blue turning bluer. The eastern sky was opalescent.
Then in one place gathered a golden light, and slowly concentrated till it was like fire. The
rosy bank of cloud turned to silver and pearl, and behind it shot up a great circle of gold.
Above the dark horizon gleamed an intensely bright disk. It was the sun. It rose swiftly, blazing
out the darkness between the ridges and giving color and distance to the sweep of land.

"Wal, wal," drawled Stillwell, and stretched his huge arms as if he had just awakened, "thet's
somethin' like."

Florence nudged Madeline and winked at her.

"Fine mawnin', girls," went on old Bill, cracking his whip. "Miss Majesty, it'll be some oninterestin'
ride all mawnin'. But when we get up a bit you'll sure like it. There! Look to the southwest,
jest over thet farthest ridge."

Madeline swept her gaze along the gray, sloping horizon-line to where dark-blue spires rose
far beyond the ridge.

"Peloncillo Mountains," said Stillwell. "Thet's home, when we get there. We won't see no more
of them till afternoon, when they rise up sudden-like."

Peloncillo! Madeline murmured the melodious name. Where had she heard it? Then she remembered.
The cowboy Stewart had told the little Mexican girl Bonita to "hit the Peloncillo trail." Probably
the girl had ridden the big, dark horse over this very road at night, alone. Madeline had a
little shiver that was not occasioned by the cold wind.

"There's a jack!" cried Florence, suddenly.

Madeline saw her first jack-rabbit. It was as large as a dog, and its ears were enormous. It
appeared to be impudently tame, and the horses kicked dust over it as they trotted by. From
then on old Bill and Florence vied with each other in calling Madeline's attention to many
things along the way. Coyotes stealing away into the brush; buzzards flapping over the carcass
of a cow that had been mired in a wash; queer little lizards running swiftly across the road;
cattle grazing in the hollows; adobe huts of Mexican herders; wild, shaggy horses, with heads
high, watching from the gray ridges--all these things Madeline looked at, indifferently at
first, because indifference had become habitual with her, and then with an interest that flourished
up and insensibly grew as she rode on. It grew until sight of a little ragged Mexican boy astride
the most diminutive burro she had ever seen awakened her to the truth. She became conscious
of faint, unmistakable awakening of long-dead feelings--enthusiasm and delight. When she realized
that, she breathed deep of the cold, sharp air and experienced an inward joy. And she divined
then, though she did not know why, that henceforth there was to be something new in her life,
something she had never felt before, something good for her soul in the homely, the commonplace,
the natural, and the wild.

Meanwhile, as Madeline gazed about her and listened to her companions, the sun rose higher
and grew warm and soared and grew hot; the horses held tirelessly to their steady trot, and
mile after mile of rolling land slipped by.

From the top of a ridge Madeline saw down into a hollow where a few of the cowboys had stopped
and were sitting round a fire, evidently busy at the noonday meal. Their horses were feeding
on the long, gray grass.

"Wal, smell of thet burnin' greasewood makes my mouth water," said Stillwell. "I'm sure hungry.
We'll noon hyar an' let the hosses rest. It's a long pull to the ranch."

He halted near the camp-fire, and, clambering down, began to unharness the team. Florence leaped
out and turned to help Madeline.

"Walk round a little," she said. "You must be cramped from sitting still so long. I'll get
lunch ready."

Madeline got down, glad to stretch her limbs, and began to stroll about. They leaped by the is

 "I reckon I won't stand to be classed with Booly an'
Ned. There ain't no cowboy on this range thet's more appreciatin' of the ladies than me, but
I shore ain't ridin' out of my way. I reckon I hev enough ridin' to do. Now, Bill, if you've
sich dog-gone good eyes mebbe you seen somethin' on the way out?"

"Nels, I hevn't seen nothin'," he replied, bluntly. His levity disappeared, and the red wrinkles
narrowed round his searching eyes.

"Jest take a squint at these hoss tracks," said Nels, and he drew Stillwell a few paces aside
and pointed to large hoofprints in the dust. "I reckon you know the hoss thet made them?"

"Gene Stewart's roan, or I'm a son-of-a-gun!" exclaimed Stillwell, and he dropped heavily to
his knees and began to scrutinize the tracks. "My eyes are sure pore; but, Nels, they ain't fresh."

"I reckon them tracks was made early yesterday mornin'."

"Wal, what if they was?" Stillwell looked at his cowboy. "It's sure as thet red nose of yourn
Gene wasn't ridin' the roan."

"Who's sayin' he was? Bill, its more 'n your eyes thet's gettin' old. Jest foller them tracks.
Come on."

Stillwell walked slowly, with his head bent, muttering to himself. Some thirty paces or more
from the camp-fire he stopped short and again flopped to his knees. Then he crawled about,
evidently examining horse tracks.

"Nels, whoever was straddlin' Stewart's hoss met somebody. An' they hauled up a bit, but didn't
git down."

"Tolerable good for you, Bill, thet reasonin'," replied the cowboy.

Stillwell presently got up and walked swiftly to the left for some rods, halted, and faced
toward the southwest, then retraced his steps. He looked at the imperturbable cowboy.

"Nels, I don't like this a little," he growled. "Them tracks make straight fer the Peloncillo
trail."

"Shore," replied Nels.

"Wal?" went on Stillwell, impatiently.

"I reckon you know what hoss made the other tracks?"

"I'm thinkin' hard, but I ain't sure."

"It was Danny Mains's bronc."

"How do you know thet?" demanded Stillwell, sharply. "Bill, the left front foot of thet little
hoss always wears a shoe thet sets crooked. Any of the boys can tell you. I'd know thet track
if I was blind."

Stillwell's ruddy face clouded and he kicked at a cactus plant.

"Was Danny comin' or goin'?" he asked.

"I reckon he was hittin' across country fer the Peloncillo trail. But I ain't shore of thet
without back-trailin' him a ways. I was jest waitin' fer you to come up."

"Nels, you don't think the boy's sloped with thet little hussy, Bonita?"

"Bill, he shore was sweet on Bonita, same as Gene was, an' Ed Linton before he got engaged,
an' all the boys. She's shore chain-lightnin', that little black-eyed devil. Danny might hev
sloped with her all right. Danny was held up on the way to town, an' then in the shame of it
he got drunk. But he'll shew up soon."

"Wal, mebbe you an' the boys are right. I believe you are. Nels, there ain't no doubt on earth
about who was ridin' Stewart's hoss?"

"Thet's as plain as the hoss's tracks."

"Wal, it's all amazin' strange. It beats me. I wish the boys would ease up on drinkin'. I was
pretty fond of Danny an' Gene. I'm afraid Gene's done fer, sure. If he crosses the border where
he can fight it won't take long fer him to get plugged. I guess I'm gettin' old. I don't stand
things like I used to."

"Bill, I reckon I'd better hit the Peloncillo trail. Mebbe I can find Danny."

"I reckon you had, Nels," replied Stillwell. "But don't take more 'n a couple of days. We can't
do much on the round-up without you. I'm short of boys."

That ended the conversation. Stillwell immediately began to hitch up his team, and the cowboys
went out to fetch their strayed horses. Madeline had been curiously interested, and she saw
that Florence knew it.

"Things happen, Miss Hammond," she said, soberly, almost sadly.

Madeline thought. And then straightway Florence began brightly to hum a tune and to busy herself
repacking what was left of the lunch. Madeline conceived a strong liking and respect for this
Western girl. She admired the consideration or delicacy or wisdom--what-ever it was--which
kept Florence from asking her what she knew or thought or felt about the events that had taken
place.

Soon they were once more bowling along the road down a gradual incline, and then they began
to climb a long ridge that had for hours hidden what lay beyond. That climb was rather tiresome,
owing to the sun and the dust and the restricted view.

When they reached the summit Madeline gave a little gasp of pleasure. A deep, gray, smooth
valley opened below and sloped up on the other side in little ridges like waves, and these
led to the foothills, dotted with clumps of brush or trees, and beyond rose dark mountains,
pine-fringed and crag-spired.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, now we're gettin' somewhere," said Stillwell, cracking his whip. "Ten miles
across this valley an' we'll be in the foothills where the Apaches used to run."

"Ten miles!" exclaimed Madeline. "It looks no more than half a mile to me."

"Wal, young woman, before you go to ridin' off alone you want to get your eyes corrected to
Western distance. Now, what'd you call them black things off there on the slope?"

"Horsemen. No, cattle," replied Madeline, doubtfully.

"Nope. Jest plain, every-day cactus. An' over hyar--look down the valley. Somethin' of a pretty
forest, ain't thet?" he asked, pointing.

Madeline saw a beautiful forest in the center of the valley toward the south.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, thet's jest this deceivin' air. There's no forest. It's a mirage."

"Indeed! How beautiful it is!" Madeline strained her gaze on the dark blot, and it seemed to
float in the atmosphere, to have no clearly defined margins, to waver and shimmer, and then
it faded and vanished.

The mountains dropped down again behind the horizon, and presently the road began once more
to slope up. The horses slowed to a walk. There was a mile of rolling ridge, and then came
the foothills. The road ascended through winding valleys. Trees and brush and rocks began to
appear in the dry ravines. There was no water, yet all along the sandy washes were indications
of floods at some periods. The heat and the dust stifled Madeline, and she had already become
tired. Still she looked with all her eyes and saw birds, and beautiful quail with crests, and
rabbits, and once she saw a deer.

"Miss Majesty," said Stillwell, "in the early days the Indians made this country a bad one
to live in. I reckon you never heerd much about them times. Surely you was hardly born then.
I'll hev to tell you some day how I fought Comanches in the Panhandle--thet was northern Texas--an'
I had some mighty hair-raisin' scares in this country with Apaches."

He told her about Cochise, chief of the Chiricahua Apaches, the most savage and bloodthirsty
tribe that ever made life a horror for the pioneer. Cochise befriended the whites once; but
he was the victim of that friendliness, and he became the most implacable of foes. Then, Geronimo,
another Apache chief, had, as late as 1885, gone on the war-path, and had left a bloody trail

 The motion of the cattle slowed from
the inside of the herd to the outside and gradually ceased. The roar and tramp of hoofs and
crack of horns and thump of heads also ceased in degree, but the bawling and bellowing continued.
While she watched, the herd spread, grew less dense, and stragglers appeared to be about to
bolt through the line of mounted cowboys.

From that moment so many things happened, and so swiftly, that Madeline could not see a tenth
of what was going on within eyesight. It seemed horsemen darted into the herd and drove out
cattle. Madeline pinned her gaze on one cowboy who rode a white horse and was chasing a steer.
He whirled a lasso around his head and threw it; the rope streaked out and the loop caught
the leg of the steer. The white horse stopped with wonderful suddenness, and the steer slid
in the dust. Quick as a flash the cowboy was out of the saddle, and, grasping the legs of the
steer before it could rise, he tied them with a rope. It had all been done almost as quickly
as thought. Another man came with what Madeline divined was a branding-iron. He applied it
to the flank of the steer. Then it seemed the steer was up with a jump, wildly looking for
some way to run, and the cowboy was circling his lasso. Madeline saw fires in the background,
with a man in charge, evidently heating the irons. Then this same cowboy roped a heifer which
bawled lustily when the hot iron seared its hide. Madeline saw the smoke rising from the touch
of the iron, and the sight made her shrink and want to turn away, but she resolutely fought
her sensitiveness. She had never been able to bear the sight of any animal suffering. The rough
work in men's lives was as a sealed book to her; and now, for some reason beyond her knowledge,
she wanted to see and hear and learn some of the every-day duties that made up those lives.

"Look, Miss Hammond, there's Don Carlos!" said Florence. "Look at that black horse!"

Madeleine saw a dark-faced Mexican riding by. He was too far away for her to distinguish his
features, but he reminded her of an Italian brigand. He bestrode a magnificent horse.

Stillwell rode up to the girls then and greeted them in his big voice.

"Right in the thick of it, hey? Wal, thet's sure fine. I'm glad to see, Miss Majesty, thet
you ain't afraid of a little dust or smell of burnin' hide an' hair."

"Couldn't you brand the calves without hurting them?" asked Madeline.

"Haw, haw! Why, they ain't hurt none. They jest bawl for their mammas. Sometimes, though, we
hev to hurt one jest to find which is his mamma."

"I want to know how you tell what brand to put on those calves that are separated from their
mothers," asked Madeline.

"Thet's decided by the round-up bosses. I've one boss an' Don Carlos has one. They decide everything,
an' they hev to be obyed. There's Nick Steele, my boss. Watch him! He's ridin' a bay in among
the cattle there. He orders the calves an' steers to be cut out. Then the cowboys do the cuttin'
out an' the brandin'. We try to divide up the mavericks as near as possible."

At this juncture Madeline's brother joined the group, evidently in search of Stillwell.

"Bill, Nels just rode in," he said.

"Good! We sure need him. Any news of Danny Mains?"

"No. Nels said he lost the trail when he got on hard ground."

"Wal, wal. Say, Al, your sister is sure takin' to the round-up. An' the boys are gettin' wise.
See thet sun-of-a-gun Ambrose cuttin' capers all around. He'll sure do his prettiest. Ambrose
is a ladies' man, he thinks."

The two men and Florence joined in a little pleasant teasing of Madeline, and drew her attention
to what appeared to be really unnecessary feats of horsemanship all made in her vicinity. The
cowboys evinced their interest in covert glances while recoiling a lasso or while passing to
and fro. It was all too serious for Madeline to be amused at that moment. She did not care
to talk. She sat her horse and watched.

The lithe, dark vaqueros fascinated her. They were here, there, everywhere, with lariats flying,
horses plunging back, jerking calves and yearlings to the grass. They were cruel to their mounts,
cruel to their cattle. Madeline winced as the great silver rowels of the spurs went plowing
into the flanks of their horses. She saw these spurs stained with blood, choked with hair.
She saw the vaqueros break the legs of calves and let them lie till a white cowboy came along
and shot them. Calves were jerked down and dragged many yards; steers were pulled by one leg.
These vaqueros were the most superb horsemen Madeline had ever seen, and she had seen the Cossacks
and Tatars of the Russian steppes. They were swift, graceful, daring; they never failed to
catch a running steer, and the lassoes always went true. What sharp dashes the horses made,
and wheelings here and there, and sudden stops, and how they braced themselves to withstand
the shock!

The cowboys, likewise, showed wonderful horsemanship, and, reckless as they were, Madeline
imagined she saw consideration for steed and cattle that was wanting in the vaqueros. They
changed mounts oftener than the Mexican riders, and the horses they unsaddled for fresh ones
were not so spent, so wet, so covered with lather. It was only after an hour or more of observation
that Madeline began to realize the exceedingly toilsome and dangerous work cowboys had to perform.
There was little or no rest for them. They were continually among wild and vicious and wide-horned
steers. In many instances they owed their lives to their horses. The danger came mostly when
the cowboy leaped off to tie and brand a calf he had thrown. Some of the cows charged with
lowered, twisting horns. Time and again Madeline's heart leaped to her throat for fear a man
would be gored. One cowboy roped a calf that bawled loudly. Its mother dashed in and just missed
the kneeling cowboy as he rolled over. Then he had to run, and he could not run very fast.
He was bow-legged and appeared awkward. Madeline saw another cowboy thrown and nearly run over
by a plunging steer. His horse bolted as if it intended to leave the range. Then close by Madeline
a big steer went down at the end of a lasso. The cowboy who had thrown it nimbly jumped down,
and at that moment his horse began to rear and prance and suddenly to lower his head close
to the ground and kick high. He ran round in a circle, the fallen steer on the taut lasso acting
as a pivot. The cowboy loosed the rope from the steer, and then was dragged about on the grass.
It was almost frightful for Madeline to see that cowboy go at his horse. But she recognized
the mastery and skill. Then two horses came into collision on the run. One horse went down;
the rider of the other was unseated and was kicked before he could get up. This fellow limped
to his mount and struck at him, while the horse showed his teeth in a vicious attempt to bite.

All the while this ceaseless activity was going on there was a strange uproar--bawl and bellow,
the shock of heavy bodies meeting and falling, the shrill jabbering of the vaqueros, and the
shouts and banterings of the cowboys. They took sharp orders and replied in jest. They went
about this stern toil as if it were a game to be played in good humor. One sang a rollicking
song, another whistled, another smoked a cigarette. The sun was hot, and they, like their horses,
were dripping with sweat. The characteristic red faces had taken on so much dust that cowboys
could not be distinguished from vaqueros except by the difference in dress. Blood was not wanting
on tireless hands. The air was thick, oppressive, rank with the smell of cattle and of burning
hide.

Madeline began to sicken. She choked with dust, was almost stifled by the odor. But that made
her all the more determined to stay there. Florence urged her to come away, or at least move
back out of the worst of it. Stillwell seconded Florence. Madeline, however, smilingly refused.
Then her brother said: "Here, this is making you sick. You're pale." And she replied that she
intended to stay until the day's work ended. Al gave her a strange look, and made no more comment.
The kindly Stillwell then began to talk.

"Miss Majesty, you're seein' the life of the cattleman an' cowboy--the real thing--same as
it was in the early days. The ranchers in Texas an' some in Arizona hev took on style, new-fangled
idees thet are good, an' I wish we could follow them. But we've got to stick to the old-fashioned,
open-range round-up. It looks cruel to you, I can see thet. Wal, mebbe so, mebbe so. Them Greasers
are cruel, thet's certain. Fer thet matter, I never seen a Greaser who wasn't cruel. But I
reckon all the strenuous work you've seen to-day ain't any tougher than most any day of a cowboy's
life. Long hours on hossback, poor grub, sleepin' on the ground, lonesome watches, dust an'
sun an' wind an' thirst, day in an' day out all the year round--thet's what a cowboy has.

"Look at Nels there. See, what little hair he has is snow-white. He's red an' thin an' hard--burned
up. You notice thet hump of his shoulders. An' his hands, when he gets close--jest take a peep
at his hands. Nels can't pick up a pin. He can't hardly button his shirt or untie a knot in
his rope. He looks sixty years--an old man. Wal, Nels 'ain't seen forty. He's a young man,
but he's seen a lifetime fer every year. Miss Majesty, it was Arizona thet made Nels what he
is, the Arizona desert an' the work of a cowman. He's seen ridin' at Canyon Diablo an' the
Verdi an' Tonto Basin. He knows every mile of Aravaipa Valley an' the Pinaleno country. He's
ranged from Tombstone to Douglas. He hed shot bad white men an' bad Greasers before he was
twenty-one. He's seen some life, Nels has. My sixty years ain't nothin'; my early days in the
Staked Plains an' on the border with Apaches ain't nothin' to what Nels has seen an' lived
through. He's just come to be part of the desert; you might say he's stone an' fire an' silence
an' cactus an' force. He's a man, Miss Majesty, a wonderful man. Rough he'll seem to you. Wal,
I'll show you pieces of quartz from the mountains back of my ranch an' they're thet rough they'd
cut your hands. But there's pure gold in them. An' so it is with Nels an' many of these cowboys.

"An' there's Price--Monty Price. Monty stands fer Montana, where he hails from. Take a good
look at him, Miss Majesty. He's been hurt, I reckon. Thet accounts fer him bein' without hoss
or rope; an' thet limp. Wal, he's been ripped a little. It's sure rare an seldom thet a cowboy
gets foul of one of them thousands of sharp horns; but it does happen."

Madeline saw a very short, wizened little man, ludicrously bow-legged, with a face the color
and hardness of a burned-out cinder. He was hobbling by toward the wagon, and one of his short,
crooked legs dragged.

"Not much to look at, is he?" went on Stillwell. "Wal; I know it's natural thet we're all best
pleased by good looks in any one, even a man. It hedn't ought to be thet way. Monty Price looks
like hell. But appearances are sure deceivin'. Monty saw years of ridin' along the Missouri
bottoms, the big prairies, where there's high grass an' sometimes fires. In Montana they have
blizzards that freeze cattle standin' in their tracks. An' hosses freeze to death. They tell
me thet a drivin' sleet in the face with the mercury forty below is somethin' to ride against.
You can't get Monty to say much about cold. All you hev to do is to watch him, how he hunts
the sun. It never gets too hot fer Monty. Wal, I reckon he was a little more prepossessin'
once. The story thet come to us about Monty is this: He got caught out in a prairie fire an'
could hev saved himself easy, but there was a lone ranch right in the line of fire, an' Monty
knowed the rancher was away, an' his wife an' baby was home. He knowed, too, the way the wind
was, thet the ranch-house would burn. It was a long chance he was takin'. But he went over,
put the woman up behind him, wrapped the baby an' his hoss's haid in a wet blanket, an' rode
away. Thet was sure some ride, I've heerd. But the fire ketched Monty at the last. The woman
fell an' was lost, an' then his hoss. An' Monty ran an' walked an' crawled through the fire
with thet baby, an' he saved it. Monty was never much good as a cowboy after thet. He couldn't
hold no jobs. Wal, he'll have one with me as long as I have a steer left."

VI. A Gift and A Purchase

For a week the scene of the round-up lay within riding-distance of the ranch-house, and Madeline
passed most of this time in the saddle, watching the strenuous labors of the vaqueros and cowboys.
She overestimated her strength, and more than once had to be lifted from her horse. Stillwell's
pleasure in her attendance gave place to concern. He tried to persuade her to stay away from
the round-up, and Florence grew even more solicitous.

Madeline, however, was not moved by their entreaties. She grasped only dimly the truth of what
it was she was learning--something infinitely more than the rounding up of cattle by cowboys,
and she was loath to lose an hour of her opportunity.

Her brother looked out for her as much as his duties permitted; but for several days he never
once mentioned her growing fatigue and the strain of excitement, or suggested that she had
better go back to the house with Florence. Many times she felt the drawing power of his keen
blue eyes on her face. And at these moments she sensed more than brotherly regard. He was watching
her, studying her, weighing her, and the conviction was vaguely disturbing. It was disquieting
for Madeline to think that Alfred might have guessed her trouble. From time to time he brought
cowboys to her and introduced them, and laughed and jested, trying to make the ordeal less
embarrassing for these men so little used to women.

Before the week was out, however, Alfred found occasion to tell her that it would be wiser
for her to let the round-up go on without gracing it further with her presence. He said it
laughingly; nevertheless, he was serious. And when Madeline turned to him in surprise he said,
bluntly:

"I don't like the way Don Carlos follows you around. Bill's afraid that Nels or Ambrose or
one of the cowboys will take a fall out of the Mexican. They're itching for the chance. Of
course, dear, it's absurd to you, but it's true."

Absurd it certainly was, yet it served to show Madeline how intensely occupied she had been
with her own feelings, roused by the tumult and toil of the round-up. She recalled that Don
Carlos had been presented to her, and that she had not liked his dark, striking face with its
bold, prominent, glittering eyes and sinister lines; and she had not liked his suave, sweet,
insinuating voice or his subtle manner, with its slow bows and gestures. She had thought he
looked handsome and dashing on the magnificent black horse. However, now that Alfred's words
made her think, she recalled that wherever she had been in the field the noble horse, with
his silver-mounted saddle and his dark rider, had been always in her vicinity.

"Don Carlos has been after Florence for a long time," said Alfred. "He's not a young man by
any means. He's fifty, Bill says; but you can seldom tell a Mexican's age from his looks. Don
Carlos is well educated and a man we know very little about. Mexicans of his stamp don't regard
women as we white men do. Now, my dear, beautiful sister from New York, I haven't much use
for Don Carlos; but I don't want Nels or Ambrose to make a wild throw with a rope and pull
the Don off his horse. So you had better ride up to the house and stay there."

"Alfred, you are joking, teasing me," said Madeline. "Indeed not," replied Alfred. "How about
it, Flo?" Florence replied that the cowboys would upon the slightest provocation treat Don
Carlos with less ceremony and gentleness than a roped steer. Old Bill Stillwell came up to
be importuned by Alfred regarding the conduct of cowboys on occasion, and he not only corroborated
the assertion, but added emphasis and evidence of his own.

"An', Miss Majesty," he concluded, "I reckon if Gene Stewart was ridin' fer me, thet grinnin'
Greaser would hev hed a bump in the dust before now."

Madeline had been wavering between sobriety and laughter until Stillwell's mention of his ideal
of cowboy chivalry decided in favor of the laughter.

"I am not convinced, but I surrender," she said. "You have only some occult motive for driving
me away. I am sure that handsome Don Carlos is being unjustly suspected. But as I have seen
a little of cowboys' singular imagination and gallantry, I am rather inclined to fear their
possibilities. So good-by."

Then she rode with Florence up the long, gray slope to the ranch-house. That night she suffered
from excessive weariness, which she attributed more to the strange working of her mind than
to riding and sitting her horse. Morning, however, found her in no disposition to rest. It
was not activity that she craved, or excitement, or pleasure. An unerring instinct, rising
dear from the thronging sensations of the last few days, told her that she had missed something
in life. It could not have been love, for she loved brother, sister, parents, friends; it could
not have been consideration for the poor, the unfortunate, the hapless; she had expressed her
sympathy for these by giving freely; it could not have been pleasure, culture, travel, society,
wealth, position, fame, for these had been hers all her life. Whatever this something was,
she had baffling intimations of it, hopes that faded on the verge of realizations, haunting
promises that were unfulfilled. Whatever it was, it had remained hidden and unknown at home,
and here in the West it began to allure and drive her to discovery. Therefore she could not
rest; she wanted to go and see; she was no longer chasing phantoms; it was a hunt for treasure
that held aloof, as intangible as the substance of dreams.

That morning she spoke a desire to visit the Mexican quarters lying at the base of the foothills.
Florence protested that this was no place to take Madeline. But Madeline insisted, and it required
only a few words and a persuading smile to win Florence over.

From the porch the cluster of adobe houses added a picturesque touch of color and contrast
to the waste of gray valley. Near at hand they proved the enchantment lent by distance. They
were old, crumbling, broken down, squalid. A few goats climbed around upon them; a few mangy
dogs barked announcement of visitors; and then a troop of half-naked, dirty, ragged children
ran out. They were very shy, and at first retreated in affright. But kind words and smiles
gained their confidence, and then they followed in a body, gathering a quota of new children
at each house. Madeline at once conceived the idea of doing something to better the condition
of these poor Mexicans, and with this in mind she decided to have a look indoors. She fancied
she might have been an apparition, judging from the effect her presence had upon the first
woman she encountered. While Florence exercised what little Spanish she had command of, trying
to get the women to talk, Madeline looked about the miserable little rooms. And there grew
upon her a feeling of sickness, which increased as she passed from one house to another. She
had not believed such squalor could exist anywhere in America. The huts reeked with filth;
vermin crawled over the dirt floors. There was absolutely no evidence of water, and she believed
what Florence told her--that these people never bathed. There was little evidence of labor.
Idle men and women smoking cigarettes lolled about, some silent, others jabbering. They did
not resent the visit of the American women, nor did they show hospitality. They appeared stupid.
Disease was rampant in these houses; when the doors were shut there was no ventilation, and
even with the doors open Madeline felt choked and stifled. A powerful penetrating odor pervaded
the rooms that were less stifling than others, and this odor Florence explained came from a
liquor the Mexicans distilled from a cactus plant. Here drunkenness was manifest, a terrible
inert drunkenness that made its victims deathlike.

Madeline could not extend her visit to the little mission-house. She saw a padre, a starved,
sad-faced man who, she instinctively felt, was good. She managed to mount her horse and ride
up to the house; but, once there, she weakened and Florence had almost to carry her in-doors.
She fought off a faintness, only to succumb to it when alone in her room. Still, she did not
entirely lose consciousness, and soon recovered to the extent that she did not require assistance.

Upon the morning after the end of the round-up, when she went out on the porch, her brother
and Stillwell appeared to be arguing about the identity of a horse.

"Wal, I reckon it's my old roan," said Stillwell, shading his eyes with his hand.

"Bill, if that isn't Stewart's horse my eyes are going back on me," replied Al. "It's not the
color or shape--the distance is too far to judge by that. It's the motion--the swing."

"Al, mebbe you're right. But they ain't no rider up on thet hoss. Flo, fetch my glass."

Florence went into the house, while Madeline tried to discover the object of attention. Presently
far up the gray hollow along a foothill she saw dust, and then the dark, moving figure of a
horse. She was watching when Florence returned with the glass. Bill took a long look, adjusted
the glasses carefully, and tried again.

"Wal, I hate to admit my eyes are gettin' pore. But I guess I'll hev to. Thet's Gene Stewart's
hoss, saddled, an' comin' at a fast clip without a rider. It's amazin' strange, an' some in
keepin' with other things concernin' Gene."

"Give me the glass," said Al. "Yes, I was right. Bill, the horse is not frightened. He's coming
steadily; he's got something on his mind."

"Thet's a trained hoss, Al. He has more sense than some men I know. Take a look with the glasses
up the hollow. See anybody?"

"No."

"Swing up over the foothills--where the trail leads. Higher--along thet ridge where the rocks
begin. See anybody?"

"By Jove! Bill--two horses! But I can't make out much for dust. They are climbing fast. One
horse gone among the rocks. There--the other's gone. What do you make of that?"

"Wal, I can't make no more 'n you. But I'll bet we know somethin' soon, fer Gene's hoss is
comin' faster as he nears the ranch."

The wide hollow sloping up into the foothills lay open to unobstructed view, and less than
half a mile distant Madeline saw the riderless horse coming along the white trail at a rapid
canter. She watched him, recalling the circumstances under which she had first seen him, and
then his wild flight through the dimly lighted streets of El Cajon out into the black night.
She thrilled again and believed she would never think of that starry night's adventure without
a thrill. She watched the horse and felt more than curiosity. A shrill, piercing whistle pealed in.

"Wal, he's seen us, thet's sure," said Bill.

The horse neared the corrals, disappeared into a lane, and then, breaking his gait again, thundered
into the inclosure and pounded to a halt some twenty yards from where Stillwell waited for him.

One look at him at close range in the clear light of day was enough for Madeline to award him
a blue ribbon over all horses, even her prize-winner, White Stockings. The cowboy's great steed
was no lithe, slender-bodied mustang. He was a charger, almost tremendous of build, with a
black coat faintly mottled in gray, and it shone like polished glass in the sun. Evidently
he had been carefully dressed down for this occasion, for there was no dust on him, nor a kink
in his beautiful mane, nor a mark on his glossy hide.

"Come hyar, you son-of-a-gun," said Stillwell.

The horse dropped his head, snorted, and came obediently up. He was neither shy nor wild. He
poked a friendly nose at Stillwell, and then looked at Al and the women. Unhooking the stirrups
from the pommel, Stillwell let them fall and began to search the saddle for something which
he evidently expected to find. Presently from somewhere among the trappings he produced a folded
bit of paper, and after scrutinizing it handed it to Al.

"Addressed to you; an' I'll bet you two bits I know what's in it," he said.

Alfred unfolded the letter, read it, and then looked at Stillwell.

"Bill, you're a pretty good guesser. Gene's made for the border. He sent the horse by somebody,
no names mentioned, and wants my sister to have him if she will accept."

"Any mention of Danny Mains?" asked the rancher.

"Not a word."

"Thet's bad. Gene'd know about Danny if anybody did. But he's a close-mouthed cuss. So he's
sure hittin' for Mexico. Wonder if Danny's goin', too? Wal, there's two of the best cowmen
I ever seen gone to hell an' I'm sorry."

With that he bowed his head and, grumbling to himself, went into the house. Alfred lifted the
reins over the head of the horse and, leading him to Madeline, slipped the knot over her arm
and placed the letter in her hand.

"Majesty, I'd accept the horse," he said. "Stewart is only a cowboy now, and as tough as any
I've known. But he comes of a good family. He was a college man and a gentleman once. He went
to the bad out here, like so many fellows go, like I nearly did. Then he had told me about
his sister and mother. He cared a good deal for them. I think he has been a source of unhappiness
to them. It was mostly when he was reminded of this in some way that he'd get drunk. I have
always stuck to him, and I would do so yet if I had the chance. You can see Bill is heartbroken
about Danny Mains and Stewart. I think he rather hoped to get good news. There's not much chance
of them coming back now, at least not in the case of Stewart. This giving up his horse means
he's going to join the rebel forces across the border. What wouldn't I give to see that cowboy
break loose on a bunch of Greasers! Oh, damn the luck! I beg your pardon, Majesty. But I'm
upset, too. I'm sorry about Stewart. I liked him pretty well before he thrashed that coyote
of a sheriff, Pat Hawe, and afterward I guess I liked him more. You read the letter, sister,
and accept the horse."

In silence Madeline bent her gaze from her brother's face to the letter:

Friend Al,--I'm sending my horse down to you because I'm going away and haven't the nerve to
take him where he'd get hurt or fall into strange hands.

If you think it's all right, why, give him to your sister with my respects. But if you don't
like the idea, Al, or if she won't have him, then he's for you. I'm not forgetting your kindness
to me, even if I never showed it. And, Al, my horse has never felt a quirt or a spur, and I'd
like to think you'd never hurt him. I'm hoping your sister will take him. She'll be good to
him, and she can afford to take care of him. And, while I'm waiting to be plugged by a Greaser
bullet, if I happen to have a picture in mind of how she'll look upon my horse, why, man, it's
not going to make any difference to you. She needn't ever know it. Between you and me, Al,
don't let her or Flo ride alone over Don Carlos's way. If I had time I could tell you something
about that slick Greaser. And tell your sister, if there's ever any reason for her to run away
from anybody when she's up on that roan, just let her lean over and yell in his ear. She'll
find herself riding the wind. So long.

Gene Stewart.

Madeline thoughtfully folded the letter and murmured, "How he must love his horse!"

"Well, I should say so," replied Alfred. "Flo will tell you. She's the only person Gene ever
let ride that horse, unless, as Bill thinks, the little Mexican girl, Bonita, rode him out
of El Cajon the other night. Well, sister mine, how about it--will you accept the horse?"

"Assuredly. And very happy indeed am I to get him. Al, you said, I think, that Mr. Stewart
named him after me--saw my nickname in the New York paper?"

"Yes."

"Well, I will not change his name. But, Al, how shall I ever climb up on him? He's taller than
I am. What a giant of a horse! Oh, look at him--he's nosing my hand. I really believe he understood
what I said. Al, did you ever see such a splendid head and such beautiful eyes? They are so
large and dark and soft--and human. Oh, I am a fickle woman, for I am forgetting White Stockings."

"I'll gamble he'll make you forget any other horse," said Alfred. "You'll have to get on him
from the porch."

As Madeline was not dressed for the saddle, she did not attempt to mount.

"Come, Majesty--how strange that sounds!--we must get acquainted. You have now a new owner,
a very severe young woman who will demand loyalty from you and obedience, and some day, after
a decent period, she will expect love."

Madeline led the horse to and fro, and was delighted with his gentleness. She discovered that
he did not need to be led. He came at her call, followed her like a pet dog, rubbed his black
muzzle against her. Sometimes, at the turns in their walk, he lifted his head and with ears
forward looked up the trail by which he had come, and beyond the foothills. He was looking
over the range. Some one was calling to him, perhaps, from beyond the mountains. Madeline liked
him the better for that memory, and pitied the wayward cowboy who had parted with his only
possession for very love of it.

That afternoon when Alfred lifted Madeline to the back of the big roan she felt high in the air.

"We'll have a run out to the mesa," said her brother, as he mounted. "Keep a tight rein on
him and ease up when you want him to go faster. But don't yell in his ear unless you want Florence
and me to see you disappear on the horizon."

He trotted out of the yard, down by the corrals, to come out on the edge of a gray, open flat
that stretched several miles to the slope of a mesa. Florence led, and Madeline saw that she
rode like a cowboy. Alfred drew on to her side, leaving Madeline in the rear. Then the leading
horses broke into a gallop. They wanted to run, and Madeline felt with a thrill that she would
hardly be able to keep Majesty from running, even if she wanted to. He sawed on the tight bridle
as the others drew away and broke from pace to gallop. Then Florence put her horse into a run.
Alfred turned and called to Madeline to come along.

"This will never do. They are running away from us," said Madeline, and she eased up her hold
on the bridle. Something happened beneath her just then; she did not know at first exactly
what. As much as she had been on horseback she had never ridden at a running gait. In New York
it was not decorous or safe. So when Majesty lowered and stretched and changed the stiff, jolting
gallop for a wonderful, smooth, gliding run it required Madeline some moments to realize what
was happening. It did not take long for her to see the distance diminishing between her and
her companions. Still they had gotten a goodly start and were far advanced. She felt the steady,
even rush of the wind. It amazed her to find how easily, comfortably she kept to the saddle.
The experience was new. The one fault she had heretofore found with riding was the violent
shaking-up. In this instance she experienced nothing of that kind, no strain, no necessity
to hold on with a desperate awareness of work. She had never felt the wind in her face, the
whip of a horse's mane, the buoyant, level spring of a tanning gait. It thrilled her, exhilarated
her, fired her blood. Suddenly she found herself alive, throbbing; and, inspired by she knew
not what, she loosened the bridle and, leaning far forward, she cried, "Oh, you splendid fellow,
run!"

She heard from under her a sudden quick clattering roar of hoofs, and she swayed back with
the wonderfully swift increase in Majesty's speed. The wind stung her face, howled in her ears,
tore at her hair. The gray plain swept by on each side, and in front seemed to be waving toward
her. In her blurred sight Florence and Alfred appeared to be coming back. But she saw presently,
upon nearer view, that Majesty was overhauling the other horses, was going to pass them. Indeed,
he did pass them, shooting by so as almost to make them appear standing still. And he ran on,
not breaking his gait till he reached the steep side of the mesa, where he slowed down and stopped.

"Glorious!" exclaimed Madeline. She was all in a blaze, and every muscle and nerve of her body
tingled and quivered. Her hands, as she endeavored to put up the loosened strands of hair,
trembled and failed of their accustomed dexterity. Then she faced about and waited for her
companions.

Alfred reached her first, laughing, delighted, yet also a little anxious.

"Holy smoke! But can't he run? Did he bolt on you?"

"No, I called in his ear," replied Madeline.

"So that was it. That's the woman of you, and forbidden fruit. Flo said she'd do it the minute
she was on him. Majesty, you can ride. See if Flo doesn't say so."

The Western girl came up then with her pleasure bright in her face.

"It was just great to see you. How your hair burned in the wind! Al, she sure can ride. Oh,
I'm so glad! I was a little afraid. And that horse! Isn't he grand? Can't he run?"

Alfred led the way up the steep, zigzag trail to the top of the mesa. Madeline saw a beautiful
flat surface of short grass, level as a floor. She uttered a little cry of wonder and enthusiasm.

"Al, what a place for golf! This would be the finest links in the world."

"Well, I've thought of that myself," he replied. "The only trouble would be--could anybody
stop looking at the scenery long enough to hit a ball? Majesty, look!"

And then it seemed that Madeline was confronted by a spectacle too sublime and terrible for
her gaze. The immensity of this red-ridged, deep-gulfed world descending incalculable distances
refused to be grasped, and awed her, shocked her.

"Once, Majesty, when I first came out West, I was down and out--determined to end it all,"
said Alfred. "And happened to climb up here looking for a lonely place to die. When I saw that
I changed my mind."

Madeline was silent. She remained so during the ride around the rim of the mesa and down the
steep trail. This time Alfred and Florence failed to tempt her into a race. She had been awe-struck;
she had been exalted she had been confounded; and she recovered slowly without divining exactly
what had come to her.

She reached the ranch-house far behind her companions, and at supper-time was unusually thoughtful.
Later, when they assembled on the porch to watch the sunset, Stillwell's humorous complainings
inspired the inception of an idea which flashed up in her mind swift as lightning. And then
by listening sympathetically she encouraged him to recite the troubles of a poor cattleman.
They were many and long and interesting, and rather numbing to the life of her inspired idea.

"Mr. Stillwell, could ranching here on a large scale, with up-to-date methods, be made--well,
not profitable, exactly, but to pay--to run without loss?" she asked, determined to kill her
new-born idea at birth or else give it breath and hope of life.

"Wal, I reckon it could," he replied, with a short laugh. "It'd sure be a money-maker. Why,
with all my bad luck an' poor equipment I've lived pretty well an' paid my debts an' haven't
really lost any money except the original outlay. I reckon thet's sunk fer good."

"Would you sell--if some one would pay your price?"

"Miss Majesty, I'd jump at the chance. Yet somehow I'd hate to leave hyar. I'd jest be fool
enough to go sink the money in another ranch."

"Would Don Carlos and these other Mexicans sell?"

"They sure would. The Don has been after me fer years, wantin' to sell thet old rancho of his;
an' these herders in the valley with their stray cattle, they'd fall daid at sight of a little
money."

"Please tell me, Mr. Stillwell, exactly what you would do here if you had unlimited means?"
went on Madeline.

"Good Lud!" ejaculated the rancher, and started so he dropped his pipe. Then with his clumsy
huge fingers he refilled it, relighted it, took a few long pulls, puffed great clouds of smoke,
and, squaring round, hands on his knees, he looked at Madeline with piercing intentness. His
hard face began to relax and soften and wrinkle into a smile.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, it jest makes my old heart warm up to think of sich a thing. I dreamed
a lot when I first come hyar. What would I do if I hed unlimited money? Listen. I'd buy out
Don Carlos an' the Greasers. I'd give a job to every good cowman in this country. I'd make
them prosper as I prospered myself. I'd buy all the good horses on the ranges. I'd fence twenty
thousand acres of the best grazin'. I'd drill fer water in the valley. I'd pipe water down
from the mountains. I'd dam up that draw out there. A mile-long dam from hill to hill would
give me a big lake, an' hevin' an eye fer beauty, I'd plant cottonwoods around it. I'd fill
that lake full of fish. I'd put in the biggest field of alfalfa in the South-west. I'd plant
fruit-trees an' garden. I'd tear down them old corrals an' barns an' bunk-houses to build new
ones. I'd make this old rancho some comfortable an' fine. I'd put in grass an' flowers all
around an' bring young pine-trees down from the mountains. An' when all thet was done I'd sit
in my chair an' smoke an' watch the cattle stringin' in fer water an' stragglin' back into
the valley. An' I see the cowboys ridin' easy an' heah them singin' in their bunks. An' thet
red sun out there wouldn't set on a happier man in the world than Bill Stillwell, last of the
old cattlemen."

Madeline thanked the rancher, and then rather abruptly retired to her room, where she felt
no restraint to hide the force of that wonderful idea, now full-grown and tenacious and alluring.

Upon the next day, late in the afternoon, she asked Alfred if it would be safe for her to ride
out to the mesa.

"I'll go with you," he said, gaily.

"Dear fellow, I want to go alone," she replied.

"Ah!" Alfred exclaimed, suddenly serious. He gave her just a quick glance, then turned away.
"Go ahead. I think it's safe. I'll make it safe by sitting here with my glass and keeping an
eye on you. Be careful coming down the trail. Let the horse pick his way. That's all."

She rode Majesty across the wide flat, up the zigzag trail, across the beautiful grassy level
to the far rim of the mesa, and not till then did she lift her eyes to face the southwest.

Madeline looked from the gray valley at her feet to the blue Sierra Madres, gold-tipped in
the setting sun. Her vision embraced in that glance distance and depth and glory hitherto unrevealed
to her. The gray valley sloped and widened to the black sentinel Chiricahuas, and beyond was
lost in a vast corrugated sweep of earth, reddening down to the west, where a golden blaze
lifted the dark, rugged mountains into bold relief. The scene had infinite beauty. But after
Madeline's first swift, all-embracing flash of enraptured eyes, thought of beauty passed away.
In that darkening desert there was something illimitable. Madeline saw the hollow of a stupendous
hand; she felt a mighty hold upon her heart. Out of the endless space, out of silence and desolation
and mystery and age, came slow-changing colored shadows, phantoms of peace, and they whispered
to Madeline. They whispered that it was a great, grim, immutable earth; that time was eternity;
that life was fleeting. They whispered for her to be a woman; to love some one before it was
too late; to love any one, every one; to realize the need of work, and in doing it to find
happiness.

She rode back across the mesa and down the trail, and, once more upon the flat, she called
to the horse and made him run. His spirit seemed to race with hers. The wind of his speed blew
her hair from its fastenings. When he thundered to a halt at the porch steps Madeline, breathless
and disheveled, alighted with the mass of her hair tumbling around her.

Alfred met her, and his exclamation, and Florence's rapt eyes shining on her face, and Stillwell's
speechlessness made her self-conscious. Laughing, she tried to put up the mass of hair.

"I must--look a--fright," she panted.

"Wal, you can say what you like," replied the old cattleman, "but I know what I think."

Madeline strove to attain calmness.

"My hat--and my combs--went on the wind. I thought my hair would go, too.... There is the evening
star.... I think I am very hungry."

And then she gave up trying to be calm, and likewise to fasten up her hair, which fell again
in a golden mass.

"Mr. Stillwell," she began, and paused, strangely aware of a hurried note, a deeper ring in
her voice. "Mr. Stillwell, I want to buy your ranch--to engage you as my superintendent. I
want to buy Don Carlos's ranch and other property to the extent, say, of fifty thousand acres.
I want you to buy horses and cattle--in short, to make all those improvements which you said
you had so long dreamed of. Then I have ideas of my own, in the development of which I must
have your advice and Alfred's. I intend to better the condition of those poor Mexicans in the
valley. I intend to make life a little more worth living for them and for the cowboys of this
range. To-morrow we shall talk it all over, plan all the business details."

Madeline turned from the huge, ever-widening smile that beamed down upon her and held out her
hands to her brother.

"Alfred, strange, is it not, my coming out to you? Nay, don't smile. I hope I have found myself--my
work--my happiness--here under the light of that western star."

VII. Her Majesty's Rancho

FIVE months brought all that Stillwell had dreamed of, and so many more changes and improvements
and innovations that it was as if a magic touch had transformed the old ranch. Madeline and
Alfred and Florence had talked over a fitting name, and had decided on one chosen by Madeline.
But this instance was the only one in the course of developments in which Madeline's wishes
were not compiled with. The cowboys named the new ranch "Her Majesty's Rancho." Stillwell said
the names cowboys bestowed were felicitous, and as unchangeable as the everlasting hills; Florence
went over to the enemy; and Alfred, laughing at Madeline's protest, declared the cowboys had
elected her queen of the ranges, and that there was no help for it. So the name stood "Her
Majesty's Rancho."

The April sun shone down upon a slow-rising green knoll that nestled in the lee of the foothills,
and seemed to center bright rays upon the long ranch-house, which gleamed snow-white from the
level summit. The grounds around the house bore no semblance to Eastern lawns or parks; there
had been no landscape-gardening; Stillwell had just brought water and grass and flowers and
plants to the knoll-top, and there had left them, as it were, to follow nature. His idea may
have been crude, but the result was beautiful. Under that hot sun and balmy air, with cool
water daily soaking into the rich soil, a green covering sprang into life, and everywhere upon
it, as if by magic, many colored flowers rose in the sweet air. Pale wild flowers, lavender
daisies, fragile bluebells, white four-petaled lilies like Eastern mayflowers, and golden poppies,
deep sunset gold, color of the West, bloomed in happy confusion. California roses, crimson
as blood, nodded heavy heads and trembled with the weight of bees. Low down in bare places,
isolated, open to the full power of the sun, blazed the vermilion and magenta blossoms of cactus
plants.

Green slopes led all the way down to where new adobe barns and sheds had been erected, and
wide corrals stretched high-barred fences down to the great squares of alfalfa gently inclining
to the gray of the valley. The bottom of a dammed-up hollow shone brightly with its slowly
increasing acreage of water, upon which thousands of migratory wildfowl whirred and splashed
and squawked, as if reluctant to leave this cool, wet surprise so new in the long desert journey
to the northland. Quarters for the cowboys--comfortable, roomy adobe houses that not even the
lamest cowboy dared describe as crampy bunks--stood in a row upon a long bench of ground above
the lake. And down to the edge of the valley the cluster of Mexican habitations and the little
church showed the touch of the same renewing hand.

All that had been left of the old Spanish house which had been Stillwell's home for so long
was the bare, massive structure, and some of this had been cut away for new doors and windows.
Every modern convenience, even to hot and cold running water and acetylene light, had been
installed; and the whole interior painted and carpentered and furnished. The ideal sought had
not been luxury, but comfort. Every door into the patio looked out upon dark, rich grass and
sweet-faced flowers, and every window looked down the green slopes.

Madeline's rooms occupied the west end of the building and comprised four in number, all opening
out upon the long porch. There was a small room for her maid, another which she used as an
office, then her sleeping-apartment; and, lastly, the great light chamber which she had liked
so well upon first sight, and which now, simply yet beautifully furnished and containing her
favorite books and pictures, she had come to love as she had never loved any room at home.
In the morning the fragrant, balmy air blew the white curtains of the open windows; at noon
the drowsy, sultry quiet seemed to creep in for the siesta that was characteristic of the country;
in the afternoon the westering sun peeped under the porch roof and painted the walls with gold
bars that slowly changed to red.

Madeline Hammond cherished a fancy that the transformation she had wrought in the old Spanish
house and in the people with whom she had surrounded herself, great as that transformation
had been, was as nothing compared to the one wrought in herself. She had found an object in
life. She was busy, she worked with her hands as well as mind, yet she seemed to have more
time to read and think and study and idle and dream than ever before. She had seen her brother
through his difficulties, on the road to all the success and prosperity that he cared for.
Madeline had been a conscientious student of ranching and an apt pupil of Stillwell. The old
cattleman, in his simplicity, gave her the place in his heart that was meant for the daughter
he had never had. His pride in her, Madeline thought, was beyond reason or belief or words
to tell. Under his guidance, sometimes accompanied by Alfred and Florence, Madeline had ridden
the ranges and had studied the life and work of the cowboys. She had camped on the open range,
slept under the blinking stars, ridden forty miles a day in the face of dust and wind. She
had taken two wonderful trips down into the desert--one trip to Chiricahua, and from there
across the waste of sand and rock and alkali and cactus to the Mexican borderline; and the
other through the Aravaipa Valley, with its deep, red-walled canyons and wild fastnesses.

This breaking-in, this training into Western ways, though she had been a so-called outdoor
girl, had required great effort and severe pain; but the education, now past its grades, had
become a labor of love. She had perfect health, abounding spirits. She was so active hat she
had to train herself into taking the midday siesta, a custom of the country and imperative
during the hot summer months. Sometimes she looked in her mirror and laughed with sheer joy
at sight of the lithe, audacious, brown-faced, flashing-eyed creature reflected there. It was
not so much joy in her beauty as sheer joy of life. Eastern critics had been wont to call her
beautiful in those days when she had been pale and slender and proud and cold. She laughed.
If they could only see her now! From the tip of her golden head to her feet she was alive,
pulsating, on fire.

Sometimes she thought of her parents, sister, friends, of how they had persistently refused
to believe she could or would stay in the West. They were always asking her to come home. And
when she wrote, which was dutifully often, the last thing under the sun that she was likely
to mention was the change in her. She wrote that she would return to her old home some time,
of course, for a visit; and letters such as this brought returns that amused Madeline, sometimes
saddened her. She meant to go back East for a while, and after that once or twice every year.
But the initiative was a difficult step from which she shrank. Once home, she would have to
make explanations, and these would not be understood. Her father's business had been such that
he could not leave it for the time required for a Western trip, or else, according to his letter,
he would have come for her. Mrs. Hammond could not have been driven to cross the Hudson River;
her un-American idea of the wilderness westward was that Indians still chased buffalo on the
outskirts of Chicago. Madeline's sister Helen had long been eager to come, as much from curiosity,
Madeline thought, as from sisterly regard. And at length Madeline concluded that the proof
of her breaking permanent ties might better be seen by visiting relatives and friends before
she went back East. With that in mind she invited Helen to visit her during the summer, and
bring as many friends as she liked.

No slight task indeed was it to oversee the many business details of Her Majesty's Rancho and
to keep a record of them. Madeline found the course of business training upon which her father
had insisted to be invaluable to her now. It helped her to assimilate and arrange the practical
details of cattle-raising as put forth by the blunt Stillwell. She split up the great stock
of cattle into different herds, and when any of these were out running upon the open range
she had them closely watched. Part of the time each herd was kept in an inclosed range, fed
and watered, and carefully handled by a big force of cowboys. She employed three cowboy scouts
whose sole duty was to ride the ranges searching for stray, sick, or crippled cattle or motherless
calves, and to bring these in to be treated and nursed. There were two cowboys whose business
was to master a pack of Russian stag-hounds and to hunt down the coyotes, wolves, and lions
that preyed upon the herds. The better and tamer milch cows were separated from the ranging
herds and kept in a pasture adjoining the dairy. All branding was done in corrals, and calves
were weaned from mother-cows at the proper time to benefit both. The old method of branding
and classing, that had so shocked Madeline, had been abandoned, and one had been inaugurated
whereby cattle and cowboys and horses were spared brutality and injury.

Madeline established an extensive vegetable farm, and she planted orchards. The climate was
superior to that of California, and, with abundant water, trees and plants and gardens flourished
and bloomed in a way wonderful to behold. It was with ever-increasing pleasure that Madeline
walked through acres of ground once bare, now green and bright and fragrant. There were poultry-yards
and pig-pens and marshy quarters for ducks and geese. Here in the farming section of the ranch
Madeline found employment for the little colony of Mexicans. Their lives had been as hard and
barren as the dry valley where they had lived. But as the valley had been transformed by the
soft, rich touch of water, so their lives had been transformed by help and sympathy and work.
The children were wretched no more, and many that had been blind could now see, and Madeline
had become to them a new and blessed virgin.

Madeline looked abroad over these lands and likened the change in them and those who lived
by them to the change in her heart. It may have been fancy, but the sun seemed to be brighter,
the sky bluer, the wind sweeter. Certain it was that the deep green of grass and garden was
not fancy, nor the white and pink of blossom, nor the blaze and perfume of flower, nor the
sheen of lake and the fluttering of new-born leaves. Where there had been monotonous gray there
was now vivid and changing color. Formerly there had been silence both day and night; now during
the sunny hours there was music. The whistle of prancing stallions pealed in from the grassy
ridges. Innumerable birds had come and, like the northward-journeying ducks, they had tarried
to stay. The song of meadow-lark and blackbird and robin, familiar to Madeline from childhood,
mingled with the new and strange heart-throbbing song of mocking-bird and the piercing blast
of the desert eagle and the melancholy moan of turtle-dove.

          *****

One April morning Madeline sat in her office wrestling with a problem. She had problems to
solve every day. The majority of these were concerned with the management of twenty-seven incomprehensible
cowboys. This particular problem involved Ambrose Mills, who had eloped with her French maid,
Christine.

Stillwell faced Madeline with a smile almost as huge as his bulk.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, we ketched them; but not before Padre Marcos had married them. All thet
speedin' in the autoomoobile was jest a-scarin' of me to death fer nothin'. I tell you Link
Stevens is crazy about runnin' thet car. Link never hed no sense even with a hoss. He ain't
afraid of the devil hisself. If my hair hedn't been white it 'd be white now. No more rides
in thet thing fer me! Wal, we ketched Ambrose an' the girl too late. But we fetched them back,
an' they're out there now, spoonin', sure oblivious to their shameless conduct."

"Stillwell, what shall I say to Ambrose? How shall I punish him? He has done wrong to deceive
me. I never was so surprised in my life. Christine did not seem to care any more for Ambrose
than for any of the other cowboys. What does my authority amount to? I must do something. Stillwell,
you must help me."

Whenever Madeline fell into a quandary she had to call upon the old cattleman. No man ever
held a position with greater pride than Stillwell, but he had been put to tests that steeped
him in humility. Here he scratched his head in great perplexity.

"Dog-gone the luck! What's this elopin' bizness to do with cattle-raisin'? I don't know nothin'
but cattle. Miss Majesty, it's amazin' strange what these cowboys hev come to. I never seen
no cowboys like these we've got hyar now. I don't know them any more. They dress swell an'
read books, an' some of them hev actooly stopped cussin' an' drinkin'. I ain't sayin' all this
is against them. Why, now, they're jest the finest bunch of cow-punchers I ever seen or dreamed
of. But managin' them now is beyond me. When cowboys begin to play thet game gol-lof an' run
off with French maids I reckon Bill Stillwell has got to resign."

"Stillwell! Oh, you will not leave me? What in the world would I do?" exclaimed Madeline, in
great anxiety.

"Wal, I sure won't leave you, Miss Majesty. No, I never'll do thet. I'll run the cattle bizness
fer you an' see after the hosses an' other stock. But I've got to hev a foreman who can handle
this amazin' strange bunch of cowboys."

"You've tried half a dozen foremen. Try more until you find the man who meets your requirements,"
said Madeline. "Never mind that now. Tell me how to impress Ambrose--to make him an example,
so to speak. I must have another maid. And I do not want a new one carried off in this summary
manner."

"Wal, if you fetch pretty maids out hyar you can't expect nothin' else. Why, thet black-eyed
little French girl, with her white skin an' pretty airs an' smiles an' shrugs, she had the
cowboys crazy. It'll be wuss with the next one."

"Oh dear!" sighed Madeline.

"An' as fer impressin' Ambrose, I reckon I can tell you how to do thet. Jest give it to him
good an' say you're goin' to fire him. That'll fix Ambrose, an' mebbe scare the other boys
fer a spell."

"Very well, Stillwell, bring Ambrose in to see me, and tell Christine to wait in my room."

It was a handsome debonair, bright-eyed cowboy that came tramping into Madeline's presence.
His accustomed shyness and awkwardness had disappeared in an excited manner. He was a happy
boy. He looked straight into Madeline's face as if he expected her to wish him joy. And Madeline
actually found that expression trembling to her lips. She held it back until she could be severe.
But Madeline feared she would fail of much severity. Something warm and sweet, like a fragrance,
had entered the room with Ambrose.

"Ambrose, what have you done?" she asked.

"Miss Hammond, I've been and gone and got married," replied Ambrose, his words tumbling over
one another. His eyes snapped, and there was a kind of glow upon his clean-shaven brown cheek.
"I've stole a march on the other boys. There was Frank Slade pushin' me close, and I was havin'
some runnin' to keep Jim Bell back in my dust. Even old man Nels made eyes at Christine! So
I wasn't goin' to take any chances. I just packed her off to El Cajon and married her."

"Oh, so I heard," said Madeline, slowly, as she watched him. "Ambrose, do you--love her?"

He reddened under her clear gaze, dropped his head, and fumbled with his new sombrero, and
there was a catch in his breath. Madeline saw his powerful brown hand tremble. It affected
her strangely that this stalwart cowboy, who could rope and throw and tie a wild steer in less
than one minute, should tremble at a mere question. Suddenly he raised his head, and at the
beautiful blase of his eyes Madeline turned her own away.

"Yes, Miss Hammond, I love her," he said. "I think I love her in the way you're askin' about.
I know the first time I saw her I thought how wonderful it'd be to have a girl like that for
my wife. It's all been so strange--her comin' an' how she made me feel. Sure I never knew many
girls, and I haven't seen any girls at all for years. But when she came! A girl makes a wonderful
difference in a man's feelin's and thoughts. I guess I never had any before. Leastways, none
like I have now. My--it--well, I guess I have a little understandin' now of Padre Marcos's
blessin'."

"Ambrose, have you nothing to say to me?" asked Madeline.

"I'm sure sorry I didn't have time to tell you. But I was in some hurry."

"What did you intend to do? Where were you going when Stillwell found you?"

"We'd just been married. I hadn't thought of anything after that. Suppose I'd have rustled
back to my job. I'll sure have to work now and save my money."

"Oh, well, Ambrose, I am glad you realize your responsibilities. Do you earn enough--is your
pay sufficient to keep a wife?"

"Sure it is! Why, Miss Hammond, I never before earned half the salary I'm gettin' now. It's
some fine to work for you. I'm goin' to fire the boys out of my bunk-house and fix it up for
Christine and me. Say, won't they be jealous?"

"Ambrose, I--I congratulate you. I wish you joy," said Madeline. "I--I shall make Christine
a little wedding-present. I want to talk to her for a few moments. You may go now."

It would have been impossible for Madeline to say one severe word to that happy cowboy. She
experienced difficulty in hiding her own happiness at the turn of events. Curiosity and interest
mingled with her pleasure when she called to Christine.

"Mrs. Ambrose Mills, please come in."

No sound came from the other room.

"I should like very much to see the bride," went on Madeline.

Still there was no stir or reply

"Christine!" called Madeline.

Then it was as if a little whirlwind of flying feet and entreating hands and beseeching eyes
blew in upon Madeline. Christine was small, graceful, plump, with very white skin and very
dark hair. She had been Madeline's favorite maid for years and there was sincere affection
between the two. Whatever had been the blissful ignorance of Ambrose, it was manifestly certain
that Christine knew how she had transgressed. Her fear and remorse and appeal for forgiveness
were poured out in an incoherent storm. Plain it was that the little French maid had been overwhelmed.
It was only after Madeline had taken the emotional girl in her arms and had forgiven and soothed
her that her part in the elopement became clear. Christine was in a maze. But gradually, as
she talked and saw that she was forgiven, calmness came in some degree, and with it a story
which amused yet shocked Madeline. The unmistakable, shy, marveling love, scarcely realized
by Christine, gave Madeline relief and joy. If Christine loved Ambrose there was no harm done.
Watching the girl's eyes, wonderful with their changes of thought, listening to her attempts
to explain what it was evident she did not understand, Madeline gathered that if ever a caveman
had taken unto himself a wife, if ever a barbarian had carried off a Sabine woman, then Ambrose
Mills had acted with the violence of such ancient forebears. Just how it all happened seemed
to be beyond Christine.

"He say he love me," repeated the girl, in a kind of rapt awe. "He ask me to marry him--he
kees me--he hug me--he lift me on ze horse--he ride with me all night--he marry me."

And she exhibited a ring on the third finger of her left hand. Madeline saw that, whatever
had been the state of Christine's feeling for Ambrose before this marriage, she loved him now.
She had been taken forcibly, but she was won.

After Christine had gone, comforted and betraying her shy eagerness to get back to Ambrose,
Madeline was haunted by the look in the girl's eyes, and her words. Assuredly the spell of
romance was on this sunny land. For Madeline there was a nameless charm, a nameless thrill
combating her sense of the violence and unfitness of Ambrose's wooing. Something, she knew
not what, took arms against her intellectual arraignment of the cowboy's method of getting
himself a wife. He had said straight out that he loved the girl--he had asked her to marry
him--he kissed her--he hugged her--he lifted her upon his horse--he rode away with her through
the night--and he married her. In whatever light Madeline reviewed this thing she always came
back to her first natural impression; it thrilled her, charmed her. It went against all the
precepts of her training; nevertheless, it was somehow splendid and beautiful. She imagined
it stripped another artificial scale from her over-sophisticated eyes.

Scarcely had she settled again to the task on her desk when Stillwell's heavy tread across
the porch interrupted her. This time when he entered he wore a look that bordered upon the
hysterical; it was difficult to tell whether he was trying to suppress grief or glee.

"Miss Majesty, there's another amazin' strange thing sprung on me. Hyars Jim Bell come to see
you, an', when I taxed him, sayin' you was tolerable busy, he up an' says he was hungry an'
he ain't a-goin' to eat any more bread made in a wash-basin! Says he'll starve first. Says
Nels hed the gang over to big bunk an' feasted them on bread you taught him how to make in
some new-fangled bucket-machine with a crank. Jim says thet bread beat any cake he ever eat,
an' he wants you to show him how to make some. Now, Miss Majesty, as superintendent of this
ranch I ought to know what's goin' on. Mebbe Jim is jest a-joshin' me. Mebbe he's gone clean
dotty. Mebbe I hev. An' beggin' your pardon, I want to know if there's any truth in what Jim
says Nels says."

Whereupon it became necessary for Madeline to stifle her mirth and to inform the sadly perplexed
old cattleman that she had received from the East a patent bread-mixer, and in view of the
fact that her household women had taken fright at the contrivance, she had essayed to operate
it herself. This had turned out to be so simple, so saving of time and energy and flour, so
much more cleanly than the old method of mixing dough with the hands, and particularly it had
resulted in such good bread, that Madeline had been pleased. Immediately she ordered more of
the bread-mixers. One day she had happened upon Nels making biscuit dough in his wash-basin,
and she had delicately and considerately introduced to him the idea of her new method. Nels,
it appeared, had a great reputation as a bread-maker, and he was proud of it. Moreover, he
was skeptical of any clap-trap thing with wheels and cranks. He consented, however, to let
her show how the thing worked and to sample some of the bread. To that end she had him come
up to the house, where she won him over. Stillwell laughed loud and long.

"Wal, wal, wal!" he exclaimed, at length. "Thet's fine, an' it's powerful funny. Mebbe you
don't see how funny? Wal, Nels has jest been lordin' it over the boys about how you showed
him, an' now you'll hev to show every last cowboy on the place the same thing. Cowboys are
the jealousest kind of fellers. They're all crazy about you, anyway. Take Jim out hyar. Why,
thet lazy cowpuncher jest never would make bread. He's notorious fer shirkin' his share of
the grub deal. I've knowed Jim to trade off washin' the pots an' pans fer a lonely watch on
a rainy night. All he wants is to see you show him the same as Nels is crowin' over. Then he'll
crow over his bunkie, Frank Slade, an' then Frank'll get lonely to know all about this wonderful
bread-machine. Cowboys are amazin' strange critters, Miss Majesty. An' now thet you've begun
with them this way, you'll hev to keep it up. I will say I never seen such a bunch to work.
You've sure put heart in them."

"Indeed, Stillwell, I am glad to hear that," replied Madeline. "And I shall be pleased to teach
them all. But may I not have them all up here at once--at least those off duty?"

"Wal, I reckon you can't onless you want to hev them scrappin'," rejoined Stillwell, dryly.
"What you've got on your hands now, Miss Majesty, is to let 'em come one by one, an' make each
cowboy think you're takin' more especial pleasure in showin' him than the feller who came before
him. Then mebbe we can go on with cattle-raisin'."

Madeline protested, and Stillwell held inexorably to what he said was wisdom. Several times
Madeline had gone against his advice, to her utter discomfiture and rout. She dared not risk
it again, and resigned herself gracefully and with subdued merriment to her task. Jim Bell
was ushered into the great, light, spotless kitchen, where presently Madeline appeared to put
on an apron and roll up her sleeves. She explained the use of the several pieces of aluminum
that made up the bread-mixer and fastened the bucket to the table-shelf. Jim's life might have
depended upon this lesson, judging from his absorbed manner and his desire to have things explained
over and over, especially the turning of the crank. When Madeline had to take Jim's hand three
times to show him the simple mechanism and then he did not understand she began to have faint
misgivings as to his absolute sincerity. She guessed that as long as she touched Jim's hand
he never would understand. Then as she began to measure out flour and milk and lard and salt
and yeast she saw with despair that Jim was not looking at the ingredients, was not paying
the slightest attention to them. His eyes were covertly upon her.

"Jim, I am not sure about you," said Madeline, severely. "How can you learn to make bread if
you do not watch me mix it?"

"I am a-watchin' you," replied Jim, innocently.

Finally Madeline sent the cowboy on his way rejoicing with the bread-mixer under his arm. Next
morning, true to Stillwell's prophecy, Frank Slade, Jim's bunkmate, presented himself cheerfully
to Madeline and unbosomed himself of a long-deferred and persistent desire to relieve his overworked
comrade of some of the house-keeping in their bunk.

"Miss Hammond," said Frank, "Jim's orful kind wantin' to do it all hisself. But he ain't very
bright, an' I didn't believe him. You see, I'm from Missouri, an' you'll have to show me."

For a whole week Madeline held clinics where she expounded the scientific method of modern
bread-making. She got a good deal of enjoyment out of her lectures. What boys these great hulking
fellows were! She saw through their simple ruses. Some of them were grave as deacons; others
wore expressions important enough to have fitted the faces of statesmen signing government
treaties. These cowboys were children; they needed to be governed; but in order to govern them
they had to be humored. A more light-hearted, fun-loving crowd of boys could not have been
found. And they were grown men. Stillwell explained that the exuberance of spirits lay in the
difference in their fortunes. Twenty-seven cowboys, in relays of nine, worked eight hours a
day. That had never been heard of before in the West. Stillwell declared that cowboys from
all points of the compass would head their horses toward Her Majesty's Rancho.

VIII. El Capitan

Stillwell's interest in the revolution across the Mexican line had manifestly increased with
the news that Gene Stewart had achieved distinction with the rebel forces. Thereafter the old
cattleman sent for El Paso and Douglas newspapers, wrote to ranchmen he knew on the big bend
of the Rio Grande, and he would talk indefinitely to any one who would listen to him. There
was not any possibility of Stillwell's friends at the ranch forgetting his favorite cowboy.
Stillwell always prefaced his eulogy with an apologetic statement that Stewart had gone to
the bad. Madeline liked to listen to him, though she was not always sure which news was authentic
and which imagination.

There appeared to be no doubt, however, that the cowboy had performed some daring feats for
the rebels. Madeline found his name mentioned in several of the border papers. When the rebels
under Madero stormed and captured the city of Juarez, Stewart did fighting that won him the
name of El Capitan. This battle apparently ended the revolution. The capitulation of President
Diaz followed shortly, and there was a feeling of relief among ranchers on the border from
Texas to California. Nothing more was heard of Gene Stewart until April, when a report reached
Stillwell that the cowboy had arrived in El Cajon, evidently hunting trouble. The old cattleman
saddled a horse and started post-haste for town. In two days he returned, depressed in spirit.
Madeline happened to be present when Stillwell talked to Alfred.

"I got there too late, Al," said the cattleman. "Gene was gone. An' what do you think of this?
Danny Mains hed jest left with a couple of burros packed. I couldn't find what way he went,
but I'm bettin' he hit the Peloncillo trail."

"Danny will show up some day," replied Alfred. "What did you learn about Stewart? Maybe he
left with Danny."

"Not much," said Stillwell, shortly. "Gene's hell-bent fer election! No mountains fer him."

"Well tell us about him."

Stillwell wiped his sweaty brow and squared himself to talk.

"Wal, it's sure amazin' strange about Gene. Its got me locoed. He arrived in El Cajon a week
or so ago. He was trained down like as if he'd been ridin' the range all winter. He hed plenty
of money--Mex, they said. An' all the Greasers was crazy about him. Called him El Capitan.
He got drunk an' went roarin' round fer Pat Hawe. You remember that Greaser who was plugged
last October--the night Miss Majesty arrived? Wal, he's daid. He's daid, an' people says thet
Pat is a-goin' to lay thet killin' onto Gene. I reckon thet's jest talk, though Pat is mean
enough to do it, if he hed the nerve. Anyway, if he was in El Cajon he kept mighty much to
hisself. Gene walked up an' down, up an' down, all day an' night, lookin' fer Pat. But he didn't
find him. An', of course, he kept gettin' drunker. He jest got plumb bad. He made lots of trouble,
but there wasn't no gun-play. Mebbe thet made him sore, so he went an' licked Flo's brother-in-law.
Thet wasn't so bad. Jack sure needed a good lickin'. Wal, then Gene met Danny an' tried to
get Danny drunk. An' he couldn't! What do you think of that? Danny hedn't been drinkin'--wouldn't
touch a drop. I'm sure glad of thet, but it's amazin' strange. Why, Danny was a fish fer red
liquor. I guess he an' Gene had some pretty hard words, though I'm not sure about thet. Anyway,
Gene went down to the railroad an' he got on an engine, an' he was in the engine when it pulled
out. Lord, I hope he doesn't hold up the train! If he gets gay over in Arizona he'll go to
the pen at Yuma. An' thet pen is a graveyard fer cowboys. I wired to agents along the railroad
to look out fer Stewart, an' to wire back to me if he's located."

"Suppose you do find him, Stillwell, what can you do?" inquired Alfred.

The old man nodded gloomily.

"I straightened him up once. Mebbe I can do it again." Then, brightening somewhat, he turned
to Madeline. "I jest hed an idee, Miss Majesty. If I can get him, Gene Steward is the cowboy
I want fer my foreman. He can manage this bunch of cow-punchers thet are drivin' me dotty.
What's more, since he's fought fer the rebels an' got that name El Capitan, all the Greasers
in the country will kneel to him. Now, Miss Majesty, we hevn't got rid of Don Carlos an' his
vaqueros yet. To be sure, he sold you his house an' ranch an' stock. But you remember nothin'
was put in black and white about when he should get out. An' Don Carlos ain't gettin' out.
I don't like the looks of things a little bit. I'll tell you now thet Don Carlos knows somethin'
about the cattle I lost, an' thet you've been losin' right along. Thet Greaser is hand an'
glove with the rebels. I'm willin' to gamble thet when he does get out he an' his vaqueros
will make another one of the bands of guerrillas thet are harassin' the border. This revolution
ain't over' yet. It's jest commenced. An' all these gangs of outlaws are goin' to take advantage
of it. We'll see some old times, mebbe. Wal, I need Gene Stewart. I need him bad. Will you
let me hire him, Miss Majesty, if I can get him straightened up?"

The old cattleman ended huskily.

"Stillwell, by all means find Stewart, and do not wait to straighten him up. Bring him to the
ranch," replied Madeline.

Thanking her, Stillwell led his horse away.

"Strange how he loves that cowboy!" murmured Madeline.

"Not so strange, Majesty," replied her brother. "Not when you know. Stewart has been with Stillwell
on some hard trips into the desert alone. There's no middle course of feeling between men facing
death in the desert. Either they hate each other or love each other. I don't know, but I imagine
Stewart did something for Stillwell--saved us life, perhaps. Besides, Stewart's a lovable chap
when he's going straight. I hope Stillwell brings him back. We do need him, Majesty. He's a
born leader. Once I saw him ride into a bunch of Mexicans whom we suspected of rustling. It
was fine to see him. Well, I'm sorry to tell you that we are worried about Don Carlos. Some
of his vaqueros came into my yard the other day when I had left Flo alone. She had a bad scare.
These vaqueros have been different since Don Carlos sold the ranch. For that matter, I never
would have trusted a white woman alone with them. But they are bolder now. Something's in the
wind. They've got assurance. They can ride off any night and cross the border."

During the succeeding week Madeline discovered that a good deal of her sympathy for Stillwell
in his hunt for the reckless Stewart had insensibly grown to be sympathy for the cowboy. It
was rather a paradox, she thought, that opposed to the continual reports of Stewart's wildness
as he caroused from town to town were the continual expressions of good will and faith and
hope universally given out by those near her at the ranch. Stillwell loved the cowboy; Florence
was fond of him; Alfred liked and admired him, pitied him; the cowboys swore their regard for
him the more he disgraced himself. The Mexicans called him El Gran Capitan. Madeline's personal
opinion of Stewart had not changed in the least since the night it had been formed. But certain
attributes of his, not clearly defined in her mind, and the gift of his beautiful horse, his
valor with the fighting rebels, and all this strange regard for him, especially that of her
brother, made her exceedingly regret the cowboy's present behavior.

Meanwhile Stillwell was so earnest and zealous that one not familiar with the situation would
have believed he was trying to find and reclaim his own son. He made several trips to little
stations in the valley, and from these he returned with a gloomy face. Madeline got the details
from Alfred. Stewart was going from bad to worse--drunk, disorderly, savage, sure to land in
the penitentiary. Then came a report that hurried Stillwell off to Rodeo. He returned on the
third day, a crushed man. He had been so bitterly hurt that no one, not even Madeline, could
get out of him what had happened. He admitted finding Stewart, failing to influence him; and
when the old cattleman got so far he turned purple in the face and talked to himself, as if
dazed: "But Gene was drunk. He was drunk, or he couldn't hev treated old Bill like thet!"

Madeline was stirred with an anger toward the brutal cowboy that was as strong as her sorrow
for the loyal old cattleman. And it was when Stillwell gave up that she resolved to take a
hand. The persistent faith of Stillwell, his pathetic excuses in the face of what must have
been Stewart's violence, perhaps baseness, actuated her powerfully, gave her new insight into
human nature. She honored a faith that remained unshaken. And the strange thought came to her
that Stewart must somehow be worthy of such a faith, or he never could have inspired it. Madeline
discovered that she wanted to believe that somewhere deep down in the most depraved and sinful
wretch upon earth there was some grain of good. She yearned to have the faith in human nature
that Stillwell had in Stewart.

She sent Nels, mounted upon his own horse, and leading Majesty, to Rodeo in search of Stewart.
Nels had instructions to bring Stewart back to the ranch. In due time Nels returned, leading
the roan without a rider.

"Yep, I shore found him," replied Nels, when questioned. "Found him half sobered up. He'd been
in a scrap, an' somebody hed put him to sleep, I guess. Wal, when he seen thet roan hoss he
let out a yell an' grabbed him round the neck. The hoss knowed him, all right. Then Gene hugged
the hoss an' cried--cried like--I never seen no one who cried like he did. I waited awhile,
an' was jest goin' to say somethin' to him when he turned on me red-eyed, mad as fire. 'Nels,'
he said, 'I care a hell of a lot fer thet boss, an' I liked you pretty well, but if you don't
take him away quick I'll shoot you both.' Wal, I lit out. I didn't even git to say howdy to him."

"Nels, you think it useless--any attempt to see him--persuade him?" asked Madeline.

"I shore do, Miss Hammond," replied Nels, gravely. "I've seen a few sun-blinded an' locoed
an' snake-poisoned an' skunk-bitten cow-punchers in my day, but Gene Stewart beats 'em all.
He's shore runnin' wild fer the divide."

Madeline dismissed Nels, but before he got out of earshot she heard him speak to Stillwell,
who awaited him on the porch.

"Bill, put this in your pipe an' smoke it--none of them scraps Gene has hed was over a woman!
It used to be thet when he was drank he'd scrap over every pretty Greaser girl he'd run across.
Thet's why Pat Hawe thinks Gene plugged the strange vaquero who was with little Bonita thet
night last fall. Wal, Gene's scrappin' now jest to git shot up hisself, for some reason thet
only God Almighty knows."

Nels's story of how Stewart wept over his horse influenced Madeline powerfully. Her next move
was to persuade Alfred to see if he could not do better with this doggedly bent cowboy. Alfred
needed only a word of persuasion, for he said he had considered going to Rodeo of his own accord.
He went, and returned alone.

"Majesty, I can't explain Stewart's singular actions," said Alfred. "I saw him, talked with

 Frankie Slade up an' made a remark--no wuss than he'd been

Frankie wasn't hurt so much as he was bewildered. 'Gene,' he says, 'what the hell struck you?'
An' Gene says, kind of sweet like, 'Frankie, you may be a nice feller when you're alone, but
your talk's offensive to a gentleman.'

"After thet what was said to Gene was with a nice smile. Now, Miss Majesty, it's beyond me
what to allow for Gene's sudden change. First off, I thought Padre Marcos had converted him.
I actooly thought thet. But I reckon it's only Gene Stewart come back--the old Gene Stewart
an' some. Thet's all I care about. I'm rememberin' how I once told you thet Gene was the last
of the cowboys. Perhaps I should hev said he's the last of my kind of cowboys. Wal, Miss Majesty,
you'll be apprecatin' of what I meant from now on."

It was also beyond Madeline to account for Gene Stewart's antics, and, making allowance for
the old cattleman's fancy, she did not weigh his remarks very heavily. She guessed why Stewart
might have been angry at the presence of Padre Marcos. Madeline supposed that it was rather
an unusual circumstance for a cowboy to be converted to religious belief. But it was possible.
And she knew that religious fervor often manifested itself in extremes of feeling and action.
Most likely, in Stewart's case, his real manner had been both misunderstood and exaggerated.
However, Madeline had a curious desire, which she did not wholly admit to herself, to see the
cowboy and make her own deductions.

The opportunity did not present itself for nearly two weeks. Stewart had taken up his duties
as foreman, and his activities were ceaseless. He was absent most of the time, ranging down
toward the Mexican line. When he returned Stillwell sent for him.

This was late in the afternoon of a day in the middle of April. Alfred and Florence were with
Madeline on the porch. They saw the cowboy turn his horse over to one of the Mexican boys at
the corral and then come with weary step up to the house, beating the dust out of his gauntlets.
Little streams of gray sand trickled from his sombrero as he removed it and bowed to the women.

Madeline saw the man she remembered, but with a singularly different aspect. His skin was brown;
his eyes were piercing and dark and steady; he carried himself erect; he seemed preoccupied,
and there was not a trace of embarrassment in his manner.

"Wal, Gene, I'm sure glad to see you," Stillwell was saying. "Where do you hail from?"

"Guadaloupe Canyon," replied the cowboy.

Stillwell whistled.

"Way down there! You don't mean you follered them hoss tracks thet far?"

"All the way from Don Carlos's rancho across the Mexican line. I took Nick Steele with me.
Nick is the best tracker in the outfit. This trail we were on led along the foothill valleys.
First we thought whoever made it was hunting for water. But they passed two ranches without
watering. At Seaton's Wash they dug for water. Here they met a pack-train of burros that came
down the mountain trail. The burros were heavily loaded. Horse and burro tracks struck south
from Seaton's to the old California emigrant road. We followed the trail through Guadelope
Canyon and across the border. On the way back we stopped at Slaughter's ranch, where the United
States cavalry are camping. There we met foresters from the Peloncillo forest reserve. If these
fellows knew anything they kept it to themselves. So we hit the trail home."

"Wal, I reckon you know enough?" inquired Stillwell, slowly.

"I reckon," replied Stewart.

"Wal, out with it, then," said Stillwell, gruffly. "Miss Hammond can't be kept in the dark
much longer. Make your report to her."

The cowboy shifted his dark gaze to Madeline. He was cool and slow.

"We're losing a few cattle on the open range. Night-drives by the vaqueros. Some of these cattle
are driven across the valley, others up to the foothills. So far as I can find out no cattle
are being driven south. So this raiding is a blind to fool the cowboys. Don Carlos is a Mexican
rebel. He located his rancho here a few years ago and pretended to raise cattle. All that time
he has been smuggling arms and ammunition across the border. He was for Madero against Diaz.
Now he is against Madero because he and all the rebels think Madero failed to keep his promises.
There will be another revolution. And all the arms go from the States across the border. Those
burros I told about were packed with contraband goods."

"That's a matter for the United States cavalry. They are patrolling the border," said Alfred.

"They can't stop the smuggling of arms, not down in that wild corner," replied Stewart.

"What is my--my duty? What has it to do with me?" inquired Madeline, somewhat perturbed.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, I reckon it hasn't nothing to do with you," put in Stillwell. "Thet's my
bizness an' Stewart's. But I jest wanted you to know. There might be some trouble follerin'
my orders."

"Your orders?"

"I want to send Stewart over to fire Don Carlos an' his vaqueros off the range. They've got
to go. Don Carlos is breakin' the law of the United States, an' doin' it on our property an'
with our hosses. Hev I your permission, Miss Hammond?"

"Why, assuredly you have! Stillwell, you know what to do. Alfred, what do you think best?"

"It'll make trouble, Majesty, but it's got to be done," replied Alfred. "Here you have a crowd
of Eastern friends due next month. We want the range to ourselves then. But, Stillwell, if
you drive those vaqueros off, won't they hang around in the foothills? I declare they are a
bad lot."

Stillwell's mind was not at ease. He paced the porch with a frown clouding his brow.

"Gene, I reckon you got this Greaser deal figgered better'n me," said Stillwell. "Now what
do you say?"

"He'll have to be forced off," replied Stewart, quietly. "The Don's pretty slick, but his vaqueros
are bad actors. It's just this way. Nels said the other day to me, 'Gene, I haven't packed
a gun for years until lately, and it feels good whenever I meet any of those strange Greasers.'
You see, Stillwell, Don Carlos has vaqueros coming and going all the time. They're guerrilla
bands, that's all. And they're getting uglier. There have been several shooting-scrapes lately.
A rancher named White, who lives up the valley, was badly hurt. It's only a matter of time
till something stirs up the boys here. Stillwell, you know Nels and Monty and Nick."

"Sure I know 'em. An' you're not mentionin' one more particular cowboy in my outfit," said
Stillwell, with a dry chuckle and a glance at Stewart.

Madeline divined the covert meaning, and a slight chill passed over her, as if a cold wind
had blown in from the hills.

"Stewart, I see you carry a gun," she said, pointing to a black handle protruding from a sheath
swinging low along his leather chaps.

"Yes, ma'am."

"Why do you carry it?" she asked.

"Well," he said, "it's not a pretty gun--and it's heavy." She caught the inference. The gun
was not an ornament. His keen, steady, dark gaze caused her vague alarm. What had once seemed
cool and audacious about this cowboy was now cold and powerful and mystical. Both her instinct
and her intelligence realized the steel fiber of the man's nature. As she was his employer,
she had the right to demand that he should not do what was so chillingly manifest that he might
do. But Madeline could not demand. She felt curiously young and weak, and the five months of
Western life were as if they had never been. She now had to do with a question involving human
life. And the value she placed upon human life and its spiritual significance was a matter
far from her cowboy's thoughts. A strange idea flashed up. Did she place too much value upon
all human life? She checked that, wondering, almost horrified at herself. And then her intuition
told her that she possessed a far stronger power to move these primitive men than any woman's
stern rule or order.

"Stewart, I do not fully understand what you hint that Nels and his comrades might do. Please
be frank with me. Do you mean Nels would shoot upon little provocation?"

"Miss Hammond, as far as Nels is concerned, shooting is now just a matter of his meeting Don
Carlos's vaqueros. It's wonderful what Nels has stood from them, considering the Mexicans he's
already killed."

"Already killed! Stewart, you are not in earnest?" cried Madeline, shocked.

"I am. Nels has seen hard life along the Arizona border. He likes peace as well as any man.
But a few years of that doesn't change what the early days made of him. As for Nick Steele
and Monty, they're just bad men, and looking for trouble."

"How about yourself, Stewart? Stillwell's remark was not lost upon me," said Madeline, prompted
by curiosity.

Stewart did not reply. He looked at her in respectful silence. In her keen earnestness Madeline
saw beneath his cool exterior and was all the more baffled. Was there a slight, inscrutable,
mocking light in his eyes, or was it only her imagination? However, the cowboy's face was as
hard as flint.

"Stewart, I have come to love my ranch," said Madeline, slowly, "and I care a great deal for
my--my cowboys. It would be dreadful if they were to kill anybody, or especially if one of
them should be killed."

"Miss Hammond, you've changed things considerable out here, but you can't change these men.
All that's needed to start them is a little trouble. And this Mexican revolution is bound to
make rough times along some of the wilder passes across the border. We're in line, that's all.
And the boys are getting stirred up."

"Very well, then, I must accept the inevitable. I am facing a rough time. And some of my cowboys
cannot be checked much longer. But, Stewart, whatever you have been in the past, you have changed."
She smiled at him, and her voice was singularly sweet and rich. "Stillwell has so often referred
to you as the last of his kind of cowboy. I have just a faint idea of what a wild life you
have led. Perhaps that fits you to be a leader of such rough men. I am no judge of what a leader
should do in this crisis. My cowboys are entailing risk in my employ; my property is not safe;
perhaps my life even might be endangered. I want to rely upon you, since Stillwell believes,
and I, too, that you are the man for this place. I shall give you no orders. But is it too
much to ask that you be my kind of a cowboy?"

Madeline remembered Stewart's former brutality and shame and abject worship, and she measured
the great change in him by the contrast afforded now in his dark, changeless, intent face.

"Miss Hammond, what kind of a cowboy is that?" he asked.

"I--I don't exactly know. It is that kind which I feel you might be. But I do know that in
the problem at hand I want your actions to be governed by reason, not passion. Human life is
not for any man to sacrifice unless in self-defense or in protecting those dependent upon him.
What Stillwell and you hinted makes me afraid of Nels and Nick Steele and Monty. Cannot they
be controlled? I want to feel that they will not go gunning for Don Carlos's men. I want to
avoid all violence. And yet when my guests come I want to feel that they will be safe from
danger or fright or even annoyance. May I not rely wholly upon you, Stewart? Just trust you
to manage these obstreperous cowboys and protect my property and Alfred's, and take care of
us--of me, until this revolution is ended? I have never had a day's worry since I bought the
ranch. It is not that I want to shirk my responsibilities; it is that I like being happy. May
I put so much faith in you?"

"I hope so, Miss Hammond," replied Stewart. It was an instant response, but none the less fraught
with consciousness of responsibility. He waited a moment, and then, as neither Stillwell nor
Madeline offered further speech, he bowed and turned down the path, his long spurs clinking
in the gravel.

"Wal, wal," exclaimed Stillwell, "thet's no little job you give him, Miss Majesty."

"It was a woman's cunning, Stillwell," said Alfred. "My sister used to be a wonder at getting
her own way when we were kids. Just a smile or two, a few sweet words or turns of thought,
and she had what she wanted."

"Al, what a character to give me!" protested Madeline. "Indeed, I was deeply in earnest with
Stewart. I do not understand just why, but I trust him. He seems like iron and steel. Then
I was a little frightened at the prospect of trouble with the vaqueros. Both you and Stillwell
have influenced me to look upon Stewart as invaluable. I thought it best to confess my utter
helplessness and to look to him for support."

"Majesty, whatever actuated you, it was a stroke of diplomacy," replied her brother. "Stewart
has got good stuff in him. He was down and out. Well, he's made a game fight, and it looks
as if he'd win. Trusting him, giving him responsibility, relying upon him, was the surest way
to strengthen his hold upon himself. Then that little touch of sentiment about being your kind
of cowboy and protecting you--well, if Gene Stewart doesn't develop into an Argus-eyed knight
I'll say I don't know cowboys. But, Majesty, remember, he's a composite of tiger breed and
forked lightning, and don't imagine he has failed you if he gets into a fight.

"I'll sure tell you what Gene Stewart will do," said Florence. "Don't I know cowboys? Why,
they used to take me up on their horses when I was a baby. Gene Stewart will be the kind of
cowboy your sister said he might be, whatever that is. She may not know and we may not guess,
but he knows."

"Wal, Flo, there you hit plumb center," replied the old cattleman. "An' I couldn't be gladder
if he was my own son."

X. Don Carlos's Vaqueros

Early the following morning Stewart, with a company of cowboys, departed for Don Carlos's rancho.
As the day wore on without any report from him, Stillwell appeared to grow more at ease; and
at nightfall he told Madeline that he guessed there was now no reason for concern.

"Wal, though it's sure amazin' strange," he continued, "I've been worryin' some about how we
was goin' to fire Don Carlos. But Gene has a way of doin' things."

Next day Stillwell and Alfred decided to ride over Don Carlos's place, taking Madeline and
Florence with them, and upon the return trip to stop at Alfred's ranch. They started in the
cool, gray dawn, and after three hours' riding, as the sun began to get bright, they entered
a mesquite grove, surrounding corrals and barns, and a number of low, squat buildings and a
huge, rambling structure, all built of adobe and mostly crumbling to ruin. Only one green spot
relieved the bald red of grounds and walls; and this evidently was made by the spring which
had given both value and fame to Don Carlos's range. The approach to the house was through
a wide courtyard, bare, stony, hard packed, with hitching-rails and watering-troughs in front
of a long porch. Several dusty, tired horses stood with drooping heads and bridles down, their
wet flanks attesting to travel just ended.

"Wal, dog-gone it, Al, if there ain't Pat Hawe's hoss I'll eat it," exclaimed Stillwell.

To zephyr is; and being always, the part whom must stand-- formerly.

It was eye-beaming-cannot.
I was model thus, nuthin in fauteuil, and had been appear always to some
sorry-come season-smasher with the content-- the dull, but solemn;

"Miss Hammond, I'm sorry you came," said Stewart, bluntly. "We're in a muddle here. I've insisted
that you and Flo be kept close to us. I'll explain later. If you can't stop your ears I beg
you to overlook rough talk."

With that he turned to the men behind him: "Nick, take Booly, go back to Monty and the boys.
Fetch out that stuff. All of it. Rustle, now!"

Stillwell and Alfred disengaged themselves from the crowd to take up positions in front of
Madeline and Florence. Pat Hawe leaned against a post and insolently ogled Madeline and then
Florence. Don Carlos pressed forward. His whole figure filled Madeline's reluctant but fascinated
eyes. He wore tight velveteen breeches, with a heavy fold down the outside seam, which was
ornamented with silver buttons. Round his waist was a sash, and a belt with fringed holster,
from which protruded a pearl-handled gun. A vest or waistcoat, richly embroidered, partly concealed
a blouse of silk and wholly revealed a silken scarf round his neck. His swarthy face showed
dark lines, like cords, under the surface. His little eyes were exceedingly prominent and glittering.
To Madeline his face seemed to be a bold, handsome mask through which his eyes piercingly betrayed
the evil nature of the man.

He bowed low with elaborate and sinuous grace. His smile revealed brilliant teeth, enhanced
the brilliance of his eyes. He slowly spread deprecatory hands.

"Senoritas, I beg a thousand pardons," he said. How strange it was for Madeline to hear English
spoken in a soft, whiningly sweet accent! "The gracious hospitality of Don Carlos has passed
with his house."

Stewart stepped forward and, thrusting Don Carlos aside, he called, "Make way, there!"

The crowd fell back to the tramp of heavy boots. Cowboys appeared staggering out of the corridor
with long boxes. These they placed side by side upon the floor of the porch.

"Now, Hawe, we'll proceed with our business," said Stewart. "You see these boxes, don't you?"

"I reckon I see a good many things round hyar," replied Hawe, meaningly.

"Well, do you intend to open these boxes upon my say-so?"

"No!" retorted Hawe. "It's not my place to meddle with property as come by express an' all
accounted fer regular."

"You call yourself a sheriff!" exclaimed Stewart, scornfully.

"Mebbe you'll think so before long," rejoined Hawe, sullenly.

"I'll open them. Here, one of you boys, knock the tops off these boxes," ordered Stewart. "No,
not you, Monty. You use your eyes. Let Booly handle the ax. Rustle, now!"

Monty Price had jumped out of the crowd into the middle of the porch. The manner in which he
gave way to Booly and faced the vaqueros was not significant of friendliness or trust.

"Stewart, you're dead wrong to bust open them boxes. Thet's ag'in' the law," protested Hawe,
trying to interfere.

Stewart pushed him back. Then Don Carlos, who had been stunned by the appearance of the boxes,
suddenly became active in speech and person. Stewart thrust him back also. The Mexican's excitement
increased. He wildly gesticulated; he exclaimed shrilly in Spanish. When, however, the lids
were wrenched open and an inside packing torn away he grew rigid and silent. Madeline raised
herself behind Stillwell to see that the boxes were full of rifles and ammunition.

"There, Hawe! What did I tell you?" demanded Stewart. "I came over here to take charge of this
ranch. I found these boxes hidden in an unused room. I suspected what they were. Contraband goods!"

"Wal, supposin' they are? I don't see any call fer sech all-fired fuss as you're makin'. Stewart,
I calkilate you're some stuck on your new job an' want to make a big show before--"

"Hawe, stop slinging that kind of talk," interrupted Stewart. "You got too free with your mouth
once before! Now here, I'm supposed to be consulting an officer of the law. Will you take charge
of these contraband goods?"

"Say, you're holdin' on high an' mighty," replied Hawe, in astonishment that was plainly pretended.
"What 're you drivin' at?"

Stewart muttered an imprecation. He took several swift strides across the porch; he held out
his hands to Stillwell as if to indicate the hopelessness of intelligent and reasonable arbitration;
he looked at Madeline with a glance eloquent of his regret that he could not handle the situation
to please her. Then as he wheeled he came face to face with Nels, who had slipped forward out
of the crowd.

Madeline gathered serious import from the steel-blue meaning flash of eyes whereby Nels communicated
something to Stewart. Whatever that something was, it dispelled Stewart's impatience. A slight
movement of his hand brought Monty Price forward with a jump. In these sudden jumps of Monty's
there was a suggestion of restrained ferocity. Then Nels and Monty lined up behind Stewart.
It was a deliberate action, even to Madeline, unmistakably formidable. Pat Hawe's face took
on an ugly look; his eyes had a reddish gleam. Don Carlos added a pale face and extreme nervousness
to his former expressions of agitation. The cowboys edged away from the vaqueros and the bronzed,
bearded horsemen who were evidently Hawe's assistants.

"I'm driving at this," spoke up Stewart, presently; and now he was slow and caustic. "Here's
contraband of war! Hawe, do you get that? Arms and ammunition for the rebels across the border!
I charge you as an officer to confiscate these goods and to arrest the smuggler--Don Carlos."

These words of Stewart's precipitated a riot among Don Carlos and his followers, and they surged
wildly around the sheriff. There was an upflinging of brown, clenching hands, a shrill, jabbering
babel of Mexican voices. The crowd around Don Carlos grew louder and denser with the addition
of armed vaqueros and barefooted stable-boys and dusty-booted herdsmen and blanketed Mexicans,
the last of whom suddenly slipped from doors and windows and round comers. It was a motley
assemblage. The laced, fringed, ornamented vaqueros presented a sharp contrast to the bare-legged,
sandal-footed boys and the ragged herders. Shrill cries, evidently from Don Carlos, somewhat
quieted the commotion. Then Don Carlos could be heard addressing Sheriff Hawe in an exhortation
of mingled English and Spanish. He denied, he avowed, he proclaimed, and all in rapid, passionate
utterance. He tossed his black hair in his vehemence; he waved his fists and stamped the floor;
he rolled his glittering eyes; he twisted his thin lips into a hundred different shapes, and
like a cornered wolf showed snarling white teeth.

It seemed to Madeline that Don Carlos denied knowledge of the boxes of contraband goods, then
knowledge of their real contents, then knowledge of their destination, and, finally, everything
except that they were there in sight, damning witnesses to somebody's complicity in the breaking
of neutrality laws. Passionate as had been his denial of all this, it was as nothing compared
to his denunciation of Stewart.

"Senor Stewart, he keel my Vaquero!" shouted Don Carlos, as, sweating and spent, he concluded
his arraignment of the cowboy. "Him you must arrest! Senor Stewart a bad man! He keel my vaquero!"

"Do you hear thet?" yelled Hawe. "The Don's got you figgered fer thet little job at El Cajon
last fall."

The clamor burst into a roar. Hawe began shaking his finger in Stewart's face and hoarsely
shouting. Then a lithe young vaquero, swift as an Indian, glided under Hawe's uplifted arm.
Whatever the action he intended, he was too late for its execution. Stewart lunged out, struck
the vaquero, and knocked him off the porch. As he fell a dagger glittered in the sunlight and
rolled clinking over the stones. The man went down hard and did not move. With the same abrupt
violence, and a manner of contempt, Stewart threw Hawe off the porch, then Don Carlos, who,
being less supple, fell heavily. Then the mob backed before Stewart's rush until all were down
in the courtyard.

The shuffling of feet ceased, the clanking of spurs, and the shouting. Nels and Monty, now
reinforced by Nick Steele, were as shadows of Stewart, so closely did they follow him. Stewart
waved them back and stepped down into the yard. He was absolutely fearless; but what struck
Madeline so keenly was his magnificent disdain. Manifestly, he knew the nature of the men with
whom he was dealing. From the look of him it was natural for Madeline to expect them to give
way before him, which they did, even Hawe and his attendants sullenly retreating.

Don Carlos got up to confront Stewart. The prostrate vaquero stirred and moaned, but did not rise.

"You needn't jibber Spanish to me," said Stewart. "You can talk American, and you can understand
American. If you start a rough-house here you and your Greasers will be cleaned up. You've
got to leave this ranch. You can have the stock, the packs and traps in the second corral.
There's grub, too. Saddle up and hit the trail. Don Carlos, I'm dealing more than square with
you. You're lying about these boxes of guns and cartridges. You're breaking the laws of my
country, and you're doing it on property in my charge. If I let smuggling go on here I'd be
implicated myself. Now you get off the range. If you don't I'll have the United States cavalry
here in six hours, and you can gamble they'll get what my cowboys leave of you."

Don Carlos was either a capital actor and gratefully relieved at Stewart's leniency or else
he was thoroughly cowed by references to the troops. "Si, Senor! Gracias, Senor!" he exclaimed;
and then, turning away, he called to his men. They hurried after him, while the fallen vaquero
got to his feet with Stewart's help and staggered across the courtyard. Passing coast we found the

 She rested while Florence and
the two men got supper. During the meal Stillwell expressed satisfaction over the good riddance
of the vaqueros, and with his usual optimism trusted he had seen the last of them. Alfred,
too, took a decidedly favorable view of the day's proceedings. However, it was not lost upon
Madeline that Florence appeared unusually quiet and thoughtful. Madeline wondered a little
at the cause. She remembered that Stewart had wanted to come with them, or detail a few cowboys
to accompany them, but Alfred had laughed at the idea and would have none of it.

After supper Alfred monopolized the conversation by describing what he wanted to do to improve
his home before he and Florence were married.

Then at an early hour they all retired.

Madeline's deep slumbers were disturbed by a pounding upon the wall, and then by Florence's
crying out in answer to a call:

"Get up! Throw some clothes on and come out!"

It was Alfred's voice.

"What's the matter?" asked Florence, as she slipped out of bed.

"Alfred, is there anything wrong?" added Madeline, sitting up.

The room was dark as pitch, but a faint glow seemed to mark the position of the window.

"Oh, nothing much," replied Alfred. "Only Don Carlos's rancho going up in smoke."

"Fire!" cried Florence, sharply.

"You'll think so when you see it. Hurry out. Majesty, old girl, now you won't have to tear
down that heap of adobe, as you threatened. I don't believe a wall will stand after that fire."

"Well, I'm glad of it," said Madeline. "A good healthy fire will purify the atmosphere over
there and save me expense. Ugh! that haunted rancho got on my nerves! Florence, I do believe
you've appropriated part of my riding-habit. Doesn't Alfred have lights in this house?"

Florence laughingly helped Madeline to dress. Then they hurriedly stumbled over chairs, and,
passing through the dining-room, went out upon the porch.

Away to the westward, low down along the horizon, she saw leaping red flames and wind-swept
columns of smoke.

Stillwell appeared greatly perturbed.

"Al, I'm lookin' fer that ammunition to blow up," he said. "There was enough of it to blow
the roof off the rancho."

"Bill, surely the cowboys would get that stuff out the first thing," replied Alfred, anxiously.

"I reckon so. But all the same, I'm worryin'. Mebbe there wasn't time. Supposin' thet powder
went off as the boys was goin' fer it or carryin' it out! We'll know soon. If the explosion
doesn't come quick now we can figger the boys got the boxes out."

For the next few moments there was a silence of sustained and painful suspense. Florence gripped
Madeline's arm. Madeline felt a fullness in her throat and a rapid beating of her heart. Presently
she was relieved with the others when Stillwell declared the danger of an explosion needed
to be feared no longer.

"Sure you can gamble on Gene Stewart," he added.

The night happened to be partly cloudy, with broken rifts showing the moon, and the wind blew
unusually strong. The brightness of the fire seemed subdued. It was like a huge bonfire smothered
by some great covering, penetrated by different, widely separated points of flame. These corners
of flame flew up, curling in the wind, and then died down. Thus the scene was constantly changing
from dull light to dark. There came a moment when a blacker shade overspread the wide area
of flickering gleams and then obliterated them. Night enfolded the scene. The moon peeped a
curved yellow rim from under broken clouds. To all appearances the fire had burned itself out.
But suddenly a pinpoint of light showed where all had been dense black. It grew and became
long and sharp. It moved. It had life. It leaped up. Its color warmed from white to red. Then
from all about it burst flame on flame, to leap into a great changing pillar of fire that climbed
high and higher. Huge funnels of smoke, yellow, black, white, all tinged with the color of
fire, slanted skyward, drifting away on the wind.

"Wal, I reckon we won't hev the good of them two thousand tons of alfalfa we was figgerin'
on," remarked Stillwell.

"Ah! Then that last outbreak of fire was burning hay," said Madeline. "I do not regret the
rancho. But it's too bad to lose such a quantity of good feed for the stock."

"It's lost, an' no mistake. The fire's dyin' as quick as she flared up. Wal, I hope none of
the boys got risky to save a saddle or blanket. Monty--he's hell on runnin' the gantlet of
fire. He's like a hoss that's jest been dragged out of a burnin' stable an' runs back sure
locoed. There! She's smolderin' down now. Reckon we-all might jest as well turn in again. It's
only three o'clock."

"I wonder how the fire originated?" remarked Alfred. "Some careless cowboy's cigarette, I'll bet."

Stillwell rolled out his laugh.

"Al, you sure are a free-hearted, trustin' feller. I'm some doubtin' the cigarette idee; but
you can gamble if it was a cigarette it belonged to a cunnin' vaquero, an' wasn't dropped accident-like."

"Now, Bill, you don't mean Don Carlos burned the rancho?" ejaculated Alfred, in mingled amaze
and anger.

Again the old cattleman laughed.

"Powerful strange to say, my friend, ole Bill means jest thet."

"Of course Don Carlos set that fire," put in Florence, with spirit. "Al, if you live out heah
a hundred years you'll never learn that Greasers are treacherous. I know Gene Stewart suspected
something underhand. That's why he wanted us to hurry away. That's why he put me on the black
horse of Don Carlos's. He wants that horse for himself, and feared the Don would steal or shoot
him. And you, Bill Stillwell, you're as bad as Al. You never distrust anybody till it's too
late. You've been singing ever since Stewart ordered the vaqueros off the range. But you sure
haven't been thinking."

"Wal, now, Flo, you needn't pitch into me jest because I hev a natural Christian spirit," replied
Stillwell, much aggrieved. "I reckon I've hed enough trouble in my life so's not to go lookin'
fer more. Wal, I'm sorry about the hay burnin'. But mebbe the boys saved the stock. An' as
fer that ole adobe house of dark holes an' under-ground passages, so long's Miss Majesty doesn't
mind, I'm darn glad it burned. Come, let's all turn in again. Somebody'll ride over early an'
tell us what's what."

Madeline awakened early, but not so early as the others, who were up and had breakfast ready
when she went into the dining-room. Stillwell was not in an amiable frame of mind. The furrows
of worry lined his broad brow and he continually glanced at his watch, and growled because
the cowboys were so late in riding over with the news. He gulped his breakfast, and while Madeline
and the others ate theirs he tramped up and down the porch. Madeline noted that Alfred grew
nervous and restless. Presently he left the table to join Stillwell outside.

"They'll slope off to Don Carlos's rancho and leave us to ride home alone," observed Florence.

"Do you mind?" questioned Madeline.

"No, I don't exactly mind; we've got the fastest horses in this country. I'd like to run that
big black devil off his legs. No, I don't mind; but I've no hankering for a situation Gene
Stewart thinks--"

Florence began disconnectedly, and she ended evasively. Madeline did not press the point, although
she had some sense of misgiving. Stillwell tramped in, shaking the floor with his huge boots;
Alfred followed him, carrying a field-glass.

"Not a hoss in sight," complained Stillwell. "Some-thin' wrong over Don Carlos's way. Miss
Majesty, it'll be jest as well fer you an' Flo to hit the home trail. We can telephone over
an' see that the boys know you're comin'."

Alfred, standing in the door, swept the gray valley with his field-glass.

"Bill, I see running stock-horses or cattle; I can't make out which. I guess we'd better rustle
over there."

Both men hurried out, and while the horses were being brought up and saddled Madeline and Florence
put away the breakfast-dishes, then speedily donned spurs, sombreros, and gauntlets.

"Here are the horses ready," called Alfred. "Flo, that black Mexican horse is a prince."

The girls went out in time to hear Stillwell's good-by as he mounted and spurred away. Alfred
went through the motions of assisting Madeline and Florence to mount, which assistance they
always flouted, and then he, too, swung up astride.

"I guess it's all right," he said, rather dubiously. "You really must not go over toward Don
Carlos's. It's only a few miles home."

"Sure it's all right. We can ride, can't we?" retorted Florence. "Better have a care for yourself,
going off over there to mix in goodness knows what."

Alfred said good-by, spurred his horse, and rode away.

"If Bill didn't forget to telephone!" exclaimed Florence. "I declare he and Al were sure rattled."

Florence dismounted and went into the house. She left the door open. Madeline had some difficulty
in holding Majesty. It struck Madeline that Florence stayed rather long indoors. Presently
she came out with sober face and rather tight lips.

"I couldn't get anybody on the 'phone. No answer. I tried a dozen times."

"Why, Florence!" Madeline was more concerned by the girl's looks than by the information she
imparted.

"The wire's been cut," said Florence. Her gray glance swept swiftly after Alfred, who was now
far out of earshot. "I don't like this a little bit. Heah's where I've got to 'figger,' as
Bill says."

She pondered a moment, then hurried into the house, to return presently with the field-glass
that Alfred had used. With this she took a survey of the valley, particularly in the direction
of Madeline's ranch-house. This was hidden by low, rolling ridges which were quite close by.

"Anyway, nobody in that direction can see us leave heah," she mused. "There's mesquite on the
ridges. We've got cover long enough to save us till we can see what's ahead."

"Florence, what--what do you expect?" asked Madeline, nervously.

"I don't know. There's never any telling about Greasers. I wish Bill and Al hadn't left us.
Still, come to think of that, they couldn't help us much in case of a chase. We'd run right
away from them. Besides, they'd shoot. I guess I'm as well as satisfied that we've got the
job of getting home on our own hands. We don't dare follow Al toward Don Carlos's ranch. We
know there's trouble over there. So all that's left is to hit the trail for home. Come, let's
ride. You stick like a Spanish needle to me."

A heavy growth of mesquite covered the top of the first ridge, and the trail went through it.
Florence took the lead, proceeding cautiously, and as soon as she could see over the summit
she used the field-glass. Then she went on. Madeline, following closely, saw down the slope
of the ridge to a bare, wide, grassy hollow, and onward to more rolling land, thick with cactus
and mesquite. Florence appeared cautious, deliberate, yet she lost no time. She was ominously
silent. Madeline's misgivings took definite shape in the fear of vaqueros in ambush.

Upon the ascent of the third ridge, which Madeline remembered was the last uneven ground between
the point she had reached and home, Florence exercised even more guarded care in advancing.
Before she reached the top of this ridge she dismounted, looped her bridle round a dead snag,
and, motioning Madeline to wait, she slipped ahead through the mesquite out of sight. Madeline
waited, anxiously listening and watching. Certain it was that she could not see or hear anything
alarming. The sun began to have a touch of heat; the morning breeze rustled the thin mesquite
foliage; the deep magenta of a cactus flower caught her eye; a long-tailed, cruel-beaked, brown
bird sailed so close to her she could have touched it with her whip. But she was only vaguely
aware of these things. She was watching for Florence, listening for some sound fraught with
untoward meaning. All of a sudden she saw Majesty's ears were held straight up. Then Florence's
face, now strangely white, showed round the turn of the trail.

"'S-s-s-sh!" whispered Florence, holding up a warning finger. She reached the black horse and
petted him, evidently to still an uneasiness he manifested. "We're in for it," she went on.
"A whole bunch of vaqueros hiding among the mesquite over the ridge! They've not seen or heard
us yet. We'd better risk riding ahead, cut off the trail, and beat them to the ranch. Madeline,
you're white as death! Don't faint now!"

"I shall not faint. But you frighten me. Is there danger? What shall we do?"

"There's danger. Madeline, I wouldn't deceive you," went on Florence, in an earnest whisper.
"Things have turned out just as Gene Stewart hinted. Oh, we should--Al should have listened
to Gene! I believe--I'm afraid Gene knew!"

"Knew what?" asked Madeline.

"Never mind now. Listen. We daren't take the back trail. We'll go on. I've a scheme to fool
that grinning Don Carlos. Get down, Madeline--hurry."

Madeline dismounted.

"Give me your white sweater. Take it off--And that white hat! Hurry, Madeline."

"Florence, what on earth do you mean?" cried Madeline.

"Not so loud," whispered the other. Her gray eyes snapped. She had divested herself of sombrero
and jacket, which she held out to Madeline. "Heah. Take these. Give me yours. Then get up on
the black. I'll ride Majesty. Rustle now, Madeline. This is no time to talk."

"But, dear, why--why do you want--? Ah! You're going to make the vaqueros take you for me!"

"You guessed it. Will you--"

"I shall not allow you to do anything of the kind," returned Madeline.

It was then that Florence's face, changing, took on the hard, stern sharpness so typical of
a cowboy's. Madeline had caught glimpses of that expression in Alfred's face, and on Stewart's
when he was silent, and on Stillwell's always. It was a look of iron and fire--unchangeable,
unquenchable will. There was even much of violence in the swift action whereby Florence compelled
Madeline to the change of apparel.

"It 'd been my idea, anyhow, if Stewart hadn't told me to do it," said Florence, her words
as swift as her hands. "Don Carlos is after you--you, Miss Madeline Hammond! He wouldn't ambush
a trail for any one else. He's not killing cowboys these days. He wants you for some reason.
So Gene thought, and now I believe him. Well, we'll know for sure in five minutes. You ride
the black; I'll ride Majesty. We'll slip round through the brush, out of sight and sound, till
we can break out into the open. Then we'll split. You make straight for the ranch. I'll cut
loose for the valley where Gene said positively the cowboys were with the cattle. The vaqueros
will take me for you. They all know those striking white things you wear. They'll chase me.
They'll never get anywhere near me. And you'll be on a fast horse. He can take you home ahead
of any vaqueros. But you won't be chased. I'm staking all on that. Trust me, Madeline. If it
were only my calculation, maybe I'd--It's because I remember Stewart. That cowboy knows things.
Come, this heah's the safest and smartest way to fool Don Carlos." Madeline felt herself more
forced than persuaded into acquiescence. She mounted the black and took up the bridle. In another
moment she was guiding her horse off the trail in the tracks of Majesty. Florence led off at
right angles, threading a slow passage through the mesquite. She favored sandy patches and
open aisles between the trees, and was careful not to break a branch. Often she stopped to
listen. This detour of perhaps half a mile brought Madeline to where she could see open ground,
the ranch-house only a few miles off, and the cattle dotting the valley. She had not lost her
courage, but it was certain that these familiar sights somewhat lightened the pressure upon
her breast. Excitement gripped her. The shrill whistle of a horse made both the black and Majesty
jump. Florence quickened the gait down the slope. Soon Madeline saw the edge of the brush,
the gray-bleached grass and level ground.

Florence waited at the opening between the low trees. She gave Madeline a quick, bright glance.

"All over but the ride! That'll sure be easy. Bolt now and keep your nerve!"

When Florence wheeled the fiery roan and screamed in his ear Madeline seemed suddenly to grow
lax and helpless. The big horse leaped into thundering action. This was memorable of Bonita
of the flying hair and the wild night ride. Florence's hair streamed on the wind and shone
gold in the sunlight. Yet Madeline saw her with the same thrill with which she had seen the
wild-riding Bonita. Then hoarse shouts unclamped Madeline's power of movement, and she spurred
the black into the open.

He wanted to run and he was swift. Madeline loosened the reins--laid them loose upon his neck.
His action was strange to her. He was hard to ride. But he was fast, and she cared for nothing
else. Madeline knew horses well enough to realize that the black had found he was free and
carrying a light weight. A few times she took up the bridle and pulled to right or left, trying
to guide him. He kept a straight course, however, and crashed through small patches of mesquite
and jumped the cracks and washes. Uneven ground offered no perceptible obstacle to his running.
To Madeline there was now a thrilling difference in the lash of wind and the flash of the gray
ground underneath. She was running away from something; what that was she did not know. But
she remembered Florence, and she wanted to look back, yet hated to do so for fear of the nameless
danger Florence had mentioned.

Madeline listened for the pounding of pursuing hoofs in her rear. Involuntarily she glanced
back. On the mile or more of gray level between her and the ridge there was not a horse, a
man, or anything living. She wheeled to look back on the other side, down the valley slope.

The sight of Florence riding Majesty in zigzag flight before a whole troop of vaqueros blanched
Madeline's cheek and made her grip the pommel of her saddle in terror. That strange gait of
her roan was not his wonderful stride. Could Majesty be running wild? Madeline saw one vaquero
draw closer, whirling his lasso round his head, but he did not get near enough to throw. So
it seemed to Madeline. Another vaquero swept across in front of the first one. Then, when Madeline
gasped in breathless expectancy, the roan swerved to elude the attack. It flashed over Madeline
that Florence was putting the horse to some such awkward flight as might have been expected
of an Eastern girl frightened out of her wits. Madeline made sure of this when, after looking
again, she saw that Florence, in spite of the horse's breaking gait and the irregular course,
was drawing slowly and surely down the valley.

Madeline had not lost her head to the extent of forgetting her own mount and the nature of
the ground in front. When, presently, she turned again to watch Florence, uncertainty ceased
in her mind. The strange features of that race between girl and vaqueros were no longer in
evidence. Majesty was in his beautiful, wonderful stride, low down along the ground, stretching,
with his nose level and straight for the valley. Between him and the lean horses in pursuit
lay an ever-increasing space. He was running away from the vaqueros. Florence was indeed "riding
the wind," as Stewart had aptly expressed his idea of flight upon the fleet roan.

A dimness came over Madeline's eyes, and it was not all owing to the sting of the wind. She
rubbed it away, seeing Florence as a flying dot in a strange blur. What a daring, intrepid
girl! This kind of strength--and aye, splendid thought for a weaker sister--was what the West
inculcated in a woman.

The next time Madeline looked back Florence was far ahead of her pursuers and going out of
sight behind a low knoll. Assured of Florence's safety, Madeline put her mind to her own ride
and the possibilities awaiting at the ranch. She remembered the failure to get any of her servants
or cowboys on the telephone. To be sure, a wind-storm had once broken the wire. But she had
little real hope of such being the case in this instance. She rode on, pulling the black as
she neared the ranch. Her approach was from the south and off the usual trail, so that she
went up the long slope of the knoll toward the back of the house. Under these circumstances
she could not consider it out of the ordinary that she did not see any one about the grounds.

It was perhaps fortunate for her, she thought, that the climb up the slope cut the black's
speed so she could manage him. He was not very hard to stop. The moment she dismounted, however,
he jumped and trotted off. At the edge of the slope, facing the corrals, he halted to lift
his head and shoot up his ears. Then he let out a piercing whistle and dashed down the lane.

Madeline, prepared by that warning whistle, tried to fortify herself for a new and unexpected
situation; but as she espied an unfamiliar company of horsemen rapidly riding down a hollow
leading from the foothills she felt the return of fears gripping at her like cold hands, and
she fled precipitously into the house.

XI. A Band of Guerrillas

Madeline bolted the door, and, flying into the kitchen, she told the scared servants to shut
themselves in. Then she ran to her own rooms. It was only a matter of a few moments for her
to close and bar the heavy shutters, yet even as she was fastening the last one in the room
she used as an office a clattering roar of hoofs seemed to swell up to the front of the house.
She caught a glimpse of wild, shaggy horses and ragged, dusty men. She had never seen any vaqueros
that resembled these horsemen. Vaqueros had grace and style; they were fond of lace and glitter
and fringe; they dressed their horses in silvered trappings. But the riders now trampling into
the driveway were uncouth, lean, savage. They were guerrillas, a band of the raiders who had
been harassing the border since the beginning of the revolution. A second glimpse assured Madeline
that they were not all Mexicans.

The presence of outlaws in that band brought home to Madeline her real danger. She remembered
what Stillwell had told her about recent outlaw raids along the Rio Grande. These flying bands,
operating under the excitement of the revolution, appeared here and there, everywhere, in remote
places, and were gone as quickly as they came. Mostly they wanted money and arms, but they
would steal anything, and unprotected women had suffered at their hands.

Madeline, hurriedly collecting her securities and the considerable money she had in her desk,
ran out, closed and locked the door, crossed the patio to the opposite side of the house, and,
entering again, went down a long corridor, trying to decide which of the many unused rooms
would be best to hide in. And before she made up her mind she came to the last room. Just then
a battering on door or window in the direction of the kitchen and shrill screams from the servant
women increased Madeline's alarm.

She entered the last room. There was no lock or bar upon the door. But the room was large and
dark, and it was half full of bales of alfalfa hay. Probably it was the safest place in the
house; at least time would be necessary to find any one hidden there. She dropped her valuables
in a dark corner and covered them with loose hay. That done, she felt her way down a narrow
aisle between the piled-up bales and presently crouched in a niche.

With the necessity of action over for the immediate present, Madeline became conscious that
she was quivering and almost breathless. Her skin felt tight and cold. There was a weight on
her chest; her mouth was dry, and she had a strange tendency to swallow. Her listening faculty
seemed most acute. Dull sounds came from parts of the house remote from her. In the intervals
of silence between these sounds she heard the squeaking and rustling of mice in the hay. A
mouse ran over her hand.

She listened, waiting, hoping yet dreading to hear the clattering approach of her cowboys.
There would be fighting--blood--men injured, perhaps killed. Even the thought of violence of
any kind hurt her. But perhaps the guerrillas would run in time to avoid a clash with her men.
She hoped for that, prayed for it. Through her mind flitted what she knew of Nels, of Monty,
of Nick Steele; and she experienced a sensation that left her somewhat chilled and sick. Then
she thought of the dark-browed, fire-eyed Stewart. She felt a thrill drive away the cold nausea.
And her excitement augmented.

Waiting, listening increased all her emotions. Nothing appeared to be happening. Yet hours
seemed to pass while she crouched there. Had Florence been overtaken? Could any of those lean
horses outrun Majesty? She doubted it; she knew it could not be true. Nevertheless, the strain
of uncertainty was torturing.

Suddenly the bang of the corridor door pierced her through and through with the dread of uncertainty.
Some of the guerrillas had entered the east wing of the house. She heard a babel of jabbering
voices, the shuffling of boots and clinking of spurs, the slamming of doors and ransacking
of rooms.

Madeline lost faith in her hiding-place. Moreover, she found it impossible to take the chance.
The idea of being caught in that dark room by those ruffians filled her with horror. She must
get out into the light. Swiftly she rose and went to the window. It was rather more of a door
than window, being a large aperture closed by two wooden doors on hinges. The iron hook yielded
readily to her grasp, and one door stuck fast, while the other opened a few inches. She looked
out upon a green slope covered with flowers and bunches of sage and bushes. Neither man nor
horse showed in the narrow field of her vision. She believed she would be safer hidden out
there in the shrubbery than in the house. The jump from the window would be easy for her. And
with her quick decision came a rush and stir of spirit that warded off her weakness.

She pulled at the door. It did not budge. It had caught at the bottom. Pulling with all her
might proved to be in vain. Pausing, with palms hot and bruised, she heard a louder, closer
approach of the invaders of her home. Fear, wrath, and impotence contested for supremacy over
her and drove her to desperation. She was alone here, and she must rely on herself. And as
she strained every muscle to move that obstinate door and heard the quick, harsh voices of
men and the sounds of a hurried search she suddenly felt sure that they were hunting for her.
She knew it. She did not wonder at it. But she wondered if she were really Madeline Hammond,
and if it were possible that brutal men would harm her. Then the tramping of heavy feet on
the floor of the adjoining room lent her the last strength of fear. Pushing with hands and
shoulders, she moved the door far enough to permit the passage of her body. Then she stepped
up on the sill and slipped through the aperture. She saw no one. Lightly she jumped down and
ran in among the bushes. But these did not afford her the cover she needed. She stole from
one clump to another, finding too late that she had chosen with poor judgment. The position
of the bushes had drawn her closer to the front of the house rather than away from it, and
just before her were horses, and beyond a group of excited men. With her heart in her throat
Madeline crouched down.

A shrill yell, followed by running and mounting guerrillas, roused her hope. They had sighted
the cowboys and were in flight. Rapid thumping of boots on the porch told of men hurrying from
the house. Several horses dashed past her, not ten feet distant. One rider saw her, for he
turned to shout back. This drove Madeline into a panic. Hardly knowing what she did, she began
to run away from the house. Her feet seemed leaden. She felt the same horrible powerlessness
that sometimes came over her when she dreamed of being pursued. Horses with shouting riders
streaked past her in the shrubbery. There was a thunder of hoofs behind her. She turned aside,
but the thundering grew nearer. She was being run down.

As Madeline shut her eyes and, staggering, was about to fall, apparently right under pounding
hoofs, a rude, powerful hand clapped round her waist, clutched deep and strong, and swung her
aloft. She felt a heavy blow when the shoulder of the horse struck her, and then a wrenching
of her arm as she was dragged up. A sudden blighting pain made sight and feeling fade from her.

But she did not become unconscious to the extent that she lost the sense of being rapidly borne
away. She seemed to hold that for a long time. When her faculties began to return the motion
of the horse was no longer violent. For a few moments she could not determine her position.
Apparently she was upside down. Then she saw that she was facing the ground, and must be lying
across a saddle with her head hanging down. She could not move a hand; she could not tell where
her hands were. Then she felt the touch of soft leather. She saw a high-topped Mexican boot,
wearing a huge silver spur, and the reeking flank and legs of a horse, and a dusty, narrow
trail. Soon a kind of red darkness veiled her eyes, her head swam, and she felt motion and
pain only dully.

After what seemed a thousand weary hours some one lifted her from the horse and laid her upon
the ground, where, gradually, as the blood left her head and she could see, she began to get
the right relation of things.

She lay in a sparse grove of firs, and the shadows told of late afternoon. She smelled wood
smoke, and she heard the sharp crunch of horses' teeth nipping grass. Voices caused her to
turn her face. A group of men stood and sat round a camp-fire eating like wolves. The looks
of her captors made Madeline close her eyes, and the fascination, the fear they roused in her
made her open them again. Mostly they were thin-bodied, thin-bearded Mexicans, black and haggard
and starved. Whatever they might be, they surely were hunger-stricken and squalid. Not one
had a coat. A few had scarfs. Some wore belts in which were scattered cartridges. Only a few
had guns, and these were of diverse patterns. Madeline could see no packs, no blankets, and
only a few cooking-utensils, all battered and blackened. Her eyes fastened upon men she believed
were white men; but it was from their features and not their color that she judged. Once she
had seen a band of nomad robbers in the Sahara, and somehow was reminded of them by this motley
outlaw troop.

They divided attention between the satisfying of ravenous appetites and a vigilant watching
down the forest aisles. They expected some one, Madeline thought, and, manifestly, if it were
a pursuing posse, they did not show anxiety. She could not understand more than a word here
and there that they uttered. Presently, however, the name of Don Carlos revived keen curiosity
in her and realization of her situation, and then once more dread possessed her breast.

A low exclamation and a sweep of arm from one of the guerrillas caused the whole band to wheel
and concentrate their attention in the opposite direction. They heard something. They saw some
one. Grimy hands sought weapons, and then every man stiffened. Madeline saw what hunted men
looked like at the moment of discovery, and the sight was terrible. She closed her eyes, sick
with what she saw, fearful of the moment when the guns would leap out.

There were muttered curses, a short period of silence followed by whisperings, and then a clear
voice rang out, "El Capitan!"

A strong shock vibrated through Madeline, and her eyelids swept open. Instantly she associated
the name El Capitan with Stewart and experienced a sensation of strange regret. It was not
pursuit or rescue she thought of then, but death. These men would kill Stewart. But surely
he had not come alone. The lean, dark faces, corded and rigid, told her in what direction to
look. She heard the slow, heavy thump of hoofs. Soon into the wide aisle between the trees
moved the form of a man, arms flung high over his head. Then Madeline saw the horse, and she
recognized Majesty, and she knew it was really Stewart who rode the roan. When doubt was no
longer possible she felt a suffocating sense of gladness and fear and wonder.

Many of the guerrillas leaped up with drawn weapons. Still Stewart approached with his hands
high, and he rode right into the camp-fire circle. Then a guerrilla, evidently the chief, waved
down the threatening men and strode up to Stewart. He greeted him. There was amaze and pleasure
and respect in the greeting. Madeline could tell that, though she did not know what was said.
At the moment Stewart appeared to her as cool and careless as if he were dismounting at her
porch steps. But when he got down she saw that his face was white. He shook hands with the
guerrilla, and then his glittering eyes roved over the men and around the glade until they
rested upon Madeline. Without moving from his tracks he seemed to leap, as if a powerful current
had shocked him. Madeline tried to smile to assure him she was alive and well; but the intent
in his eyes, the power of his controlled spirit telling her of her peril and his, froze the
smile on her lips.

With that he faced the chief and spoke rapidly in the Mexican jargon Madeline had always found
so difficult to translate. The chief answered, spreading wide his hands, one of which indicated
Madeline as she lay there. Stewart drew the fellow a little aside and said something for his
ear alone. The chief's hands swept up in a gesture of surprise and acquiescence. Again Stewart
spoke swiftly. His hearer then turned to address the band. Madeline caught the words "Don Carlos"
and "pesos." There was a brief muttering protest which the chief thundered down. Madeline guessed
her release had been given by this guerrilla and bought from the others of the band.

Stewart strode to her side, leading the roan. Majesty reared and snorted when he saw his mistress
prostrate. Stewart knelt, still holding the bridle.

"Are you all right?" he asked.

"I think so," she replied, essaying a laugh that was rather a failure. "My feet are tied."

Dark blood blotted out all the white from his face, and lightning shot from his eyes. She felt
his hands, like steel tongs, loosening the bonds round her ankles. Without a word he lifted
her upright and then upon Majesty. Madeline reeled a little in the saddle, held hard to the
pommel with one hand, and tried to lean on Stewart's shoulder with the other.

"Don't give up," he said.

She saw him gaze furtively into the forest on all sides. And it surprised her to see the guerrillas
riding away. Putting the two facts together, Madeline formed an idea that neither Stewart nor
the others desired to meet with some one evidently due shortly in the glade. Stewart guided
the roan off to the right and walked beside Madeline, steadying her in the saddle. At first
Madeline was so weak and dizzy that she could scarcely retain her seat. The dizziness left
her presently, and then she made an effort to ride without help. Her weakness, however, and
a pain in her wrenched arm made the task laborsome.

Stewart had struck off the trail, if there were one, and was keeping to denser parts of the
forest. The sun sank low, and the shafts of gold fell with a long slant among the firs. Majesty's
hoofs made no sound on the soft ground, and Stewart strode on without speaking. Neither his
hurry nor vigilance relaxed until at least two miles had been covered. Then he held to a straighter
course and did not send so many glances into the darkening woods. The level of the forest began
to be cut up by little hollows, all of which sloped and widened. Presently the soft ground
gave place to bare, rocky soil. The horse snorted and tossed his head. A sound of splashing
water broke the silence. The hollow opened into a wider one through which a little brook murmured
its way over the stones. Majesty snorted again and stopped and bent his head.

"He wants a drink," said Madeline. "I'm thirsty, too, and very tired."

Stewart lifted her out of the saddle, and as their hands parted she felt something moist and
warm. Near It, the drinkin, monty could have seemed to turn t in his it, and

Don Carlos hed you kidnapped. Sure they're goin' to break soon, an' then we'll hev a couple
of wild Texas steers ridin' the range. I've a heap to worry me."

"Let Stewart take his mysterious trips into the mountains. Here, Stillwell, I have news for
you that may give you reason for worry. I have letters from home. And my sister, with a party
of friends, is coming out to visit me. They are society folk, and one of them is an English lord."

"Wal, Miss Majesty, I reckon we'll all be glad to see them," said Stillwell. "Onless they pack
you off back East."

"That isn't likely," replied Madeline, thoughtfully. "I must go back some time, though. Well,
let me read you a few extracts from my mail."

Madeline took up her sister's letter with a strange sensation of how easily sight of a crested
monogram and scent of delicately perfumed paper could recall the brilliant life she had given
up. She scanned the pages of beautiful handwriting. Helen's letter was in turn gay and brilliant
and lazy, just as she was herself; but Madeline detected more of curiosity in it than of real
longing to see the sister and brother in the Far West. Much of what Helen wrote was enthusiastic
anticipation of the fun she expected to have with bashful cowboys. Helen seldom wrote letters,
and she never read anything, not even popular novels of the day. She was as absolutely ignorant
of the West as the Englishman, who, she said, expected to hunt buffalo and fight Indians. Moreover,
there was a satiric note in the letter that Madeline did not like, and which roused her spirit.
Manifestly, Helen was reveling in the prospect of new sensation.

When she finished reading aloud a few paragraphs the old cattleman snorted and his face grew
redder.

"Did your sister write that?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Wal, I--I beg pawdin, Miss Majesty. But it doesn't seem like you. Does she think we're a lot
of wild men from Borneo?"

"Evidently she does. I rather think she is in for a surprise. Now, Stillwell, you are clever
and you can see the situation. I want my guests to enjoy their stay here, but I do not want
that to be at the expense of the feelings of all of us, or even any one. Helen will bring a
lively crowd. They'll crave excitement--the unusual. Let us see that they are not disappointed.
You take the boys into your confidence. Tell them what to expect, and tell them how to meet
it. I shall help you in that. I want the boys to be on dress-parade when they are off duty.
I want them to be on their most elegant behavior. I do not care what they do, what measures
they take to protect themselves, what tricks they contrive, so long as they do not overstep
the limit of kindness and courtesy. I want them to play their parts seriously, naturally, as
if they had lived no other way. My guests expect to have fun. Let us meet them with fun. Now
what do you say?"

Stillwell rose, his great bulk towering, his huge face beaming.

"Wal, I say it's the most amazin' fine idee I ever heerd in my life."

"Indeed, I am glad you like it," went on Madeline.

"Come to me again, Stillwell, after you have spoken to the boys. But, now that I have suggested
it, I am a little afraid. You know what cowboy fun is. Perhaps--"

"Don't you go back on that idee," interrupted Stillwell. He was assuring and bland, but his
hurry to convince Madeline betrayed him. "Leave the boys to me. Why, don't they all swear by
you, same as the Mexicans do to the Virgin? They won't disgrace you, Miss Majesty. They'll
be simply immense. It'll beat any show you ever seen."

"I believe it will," replied Madeline. She was still doubtful of her plan, but the enthusiasm
of the old cattleman was infectious and irresistible. "Very well, we will consider it settled.
My guests will arrive on May ninth. Meanwhile let us get Her Majesty's Rancho in shape for
this invasion." 

    And off Shakespeare we do not even suspect that he get ever remembered
it whispered. An school, which mistakes and haunting, seems to breath
when it finds itself on verge, and come to say and shivered out to
itself, "Good heavens!

It had almost wrapped if I was appeared!" The quality in him which makes him did not know it were

He allows her was here and here had the sight, if the distraction
of a humorous one.



One glance through the powerful binoculars convinced Madeline that Florence was right. And
another glance at Stillwell told her that he was speechless with delight. She remembered a
little conversation she had had with Link Stevens a short while previous.

"Stevens, I hope the car is in good shape," she had said. "Now, Miss Hammond, she's as right
as the best-trained hoss I ever rode," he had replied.

"The valley road is perfect," she had gone on, musingly. "I never saw such a beautiful road,
even in France. No fences, no ditches, no rocks, no vehicles. Just a lonely road on the desert."

"Shore, it's lonely," Stevens had answered, with slowly brightening eyes. "An' safe, Miss Hammond."

"My sister used to like fast riding. If I remember correctly, all of my guests were a little
afflicted with the speed mania. It is a common disease with New-Yorkers. I hope, Stevens, that
you will not give them reason to think we are altogether steeped in the slow, dreamy manana
languor of the Southwest."

Link doubtfully eyed her, and then his bronze face changed its dark aspect and seemed to shine.

"Beggin' your pardon, Miss Hammond, thet's shore tall talk fer Link Stevens to savvy. You mean--as
long as I drive careful an' safe I can run away from my dust, so to say, an' get here in somethin'
less than the Greaser's to-morrow?"

Madeline had laughed her assent. And now, as she watched the thin streak of dust, at that distance
moving with snail pace, she reproached herself. She trusted Stevens; she had never known so
skilful, daring, and iron-nerved a driver as he was. If she had been in the car herself she
would have had no anxiety. But, imagining what Stevens would do on forty miles and more of
that desert road, Madeline suffered a prick of conscience.

"Oh, Stillwell!" she exclaimed. "I am afraid I will go back on my wonderful idea. What made
me do it?"

"Your sister wanted the real thing, didn't she? Said they all wanted it. Wal, I reckon they've
begun gettin' it," replied Stillwell.

That statement from the cattleman allayed Madeline's pangs of conscience. She understood just
what she felt, though she could not have put it in words. She was hungry for a sight of well-remembered
faces; she longed to hear the soft laughter and gay repartee of old friends; she was eager
for gossipy first-hand news of her old world. All is food that arrive to net. There are amongst them
take your life had bent for argument. Their soul is caused on cowboys or suppose of they had to
see, on hands to coat. You would have a ears are forth to spoil of rose or listen to prayers
would stretch for mercy. To--, had their ordering is go to you had, and if it is on grasp
is fractional to be obeyed. Ay, and merry ruler whom are sooner hear to if they spoil,'jest to
harness,'than they slap to jest,'build one.'" She wistfully wondered, however,
if her sister or friends would come to see the West even a little as she saw it. That, perhaps,
would he hoping too much. She resolved once for all to do her best to give them the sensation
their senses craved, and equally to show them the sweetness and beauty and wholesomeness and
strength of life in the Southwest.

"Wal, as Nels says, I wouldn't be in that there ottomobile right now for a million pesos,"
remarked Stillwell.

"Why? Is Stevens driving fast?"

"Good Lord! Fast? Miss Majesty, there hain't ever been anythin' except a streak of lightnin'
run so fast in this country. I'll bet Link for once is in heaven. I can jest see him now, the
grim, crooked-legged little devil, hunchin' down over that wheel as if it was a hoss's neck."

"I told him not to let the ride be hot or dusty," remarked Madeline.

"Haw, haw!" roared Stillwell. "Wal, I'll be goin'. I reckon I'd like to be hyar when Link drives
up, but I want to be with the boys down by the bunks. It'll be some fun to see Nels an' Monty
when Link comes flyin' along."

"I wish Al had stayed to meet them," said Madeline.

Her brother had rather hurried a shipment of cattle to California: and it was Madeline's supposition
that he had welcomed the opportunity to absent himself from the ranch.

"I am sorry he wouldn't stay," replied Florence. "But Al's all business now. And he's doing
finely. It's just as well, perhaps."

"Surely. That was my pride speaking. I would like to have all my family and all my old friends
see what a man Al has become. Well, Link Stevens is running like the wind. The car will be
here before we know it. Florence, we've only a few moments to dress. But first I want to order
many and various and exceedingly cold refreshments for that approaching party."

Stewart kept without heart. "she is all a sham," he wondered: "the dig cognize him merchandise him climbed,
i'll be curse, Coombs. Me tell as ringan."
 In that instant, as her keen gaze searched
his dust-caked face, she met the full, free look of his eyes. Her own did not fall, though
she felt a warmth steal to her cheeks. Madeline very seldom blushed. And now, conscious of
her sudden color a genuine blush flamed on her face. It was irritating because it was incomprehensible.
She received the papers from Stewart and thanked him. He bowed, then led the black down the
path toward the corrals.

"When Stewart looks like that he's been riding," said Florence. "But when his horse looks like
that he's sure been burning the wind."

Madeline watched the weary horse and rider limp down the path. What had made her thoughtful?
Mostly it was something new or sudden or inexplicable that stirred her mind to quick analysis.
In this instance the thing that had struck Madeline was Stewart's glance. He had looked at
her, and the old burning, inscrutable fire, the darkness, had left his eyes. Suddenly they
had been beautiful. The look had not been one of surprise or admiration; nor had it been one
of love. She was familiar, too familiar with all three. It had not been a gaze of passion,
for there was nothing beautiful in that. Madeline pondered. And presently she realized that
Stewart's eyes had expressed a strange joy of pride. That expression Madeline had never before
encountered in the look of any man. Probably its strangeness had made her notice it and accounted
for her blushing. The longer she lived among these outdoor men the more they surprised her.
Particularly, how incomprehensible was this cowboy Stewart! Why should he have pride or joy
at sight of her?

Florence's exclamation made Madeline once more attend to the approaching automobile. It was
on the slope now, some miles down the long gradual slant. Two yellow funnel-shaped clouds of
dust seemed to shoot out from behind the car and roll aloft to join the column that stretched
down the valley.

"I wonder what riding a mile a minute would be like," said Florence. "I'll sure make Link take
me. Oh, but look at him come!"

The giant car resembled a white demon, and but for the dust would have appeared to be sailing
in the air. Its motion was steadily forward, holding to the road as if on rails. And its velocity
was astounding. Long, gray veils, like pennants, streamed in the wind. A low rushing sound
became perceptible, and it grew louder, became a roar. The car shot like an arrow past the
alfalfa-field, by the bunk-houses, where the cowboys waved and cheered. The horses and burros
in the corrals began to snort and tramp and race in fright. At the base of the long slope of
the foothill Link cut the speed more than half. Yet the car roared up, rolling the dust, flying
capes and veils and ulsters, and crashed and cracked to a halt in the yard before the porch.

Madeline descried a gray, disheveled mass of humanity packed inside the car. Besides the driver
there were seven occupants, and for a moment they appeared to be coming to life, moving and
exclaiming under the veils and wraps and dust-shields.

Link Stevens stepped out and, removing helmet and goggles, coolly looked at his watch.

"An hour an' a quarter, Miss Hammond," he said. "It's sixty-three miles by the valley road,
an' you know there's a couple of bad hills. I reckon we made fair time, considerin' you wanted
me to drive slow an' safe."

From the mass of dusty-veiled humanity in the car came low exclamations and plaintive feminine
wails.

Madeline stepped to the front of the porch. Then the deep voices of men and softer voices of
women united in one glad outburst, as much a thanksgiving as a greeting, "MAJESTY!"

          *****

Helen Hammond was three years younger than Madeline, and a slender, pretty girl. She did not
resemble her sister, except in whiteness and fineness of skin, being more of a brown-eyed,
brown-haired type. Having recovered her breath soon after Madeline took her to her room, she
began to talk.

"Majesty, old girl, I'm here; but you can bet I would never have gotten here if I had known
about that ride from the railroad. You never wrote that you had a car. I thought this was out
West--stage-coach, and all that sort of thing. Such a tremendous car! And the road! And that
terrible little man with the leather trousers! What kind of a chauffeur is he?"

"He's a cowboy. He was crippled by falling under his horse, so I had him instructed to run
the car. He can drive, don't you think?"

"Drive? Good gracious! He scared us to death, except Castleton. Nothing could scare that cold-blooded
little Englishman. I am dizzy yet. Do you know, Majesty, I was delighted when I saw the car.
Then your cowboy driver met us at the platform. What a queer-looking individual! He had a big
pistol strapped to those leather trousers. That made me nervous. When he piled us all in with
our grips, he put me in the seat beside him, whether I liked it or not. I was fool enough to
tell him I loved to travel fast. What do you think he said? Well, he eyed me in a rather cool
and speculative way and said, with a smile, 'Miss, I reckon anything you love an' want bad
will be coming to you out here!' I didn't know whether it was delightful candor or impudence.
Then he said to all of us: 'Shore you had better wrap up in the veils an' dusters. It's a long,
slow, hot, dusty ride to the ranch, an' Miss Hammond's order was to drive safe.' He got our
baggage checks and gave them to a man with a huge wagon and a four-horse team. Then he cranked
the car, jumped in, wrapped his arms round the wheel, and sank down low in his seat. There
was a crack, a jerk, a kind of flash around us, and that dirty little town was somewhere on
the map behind. For about five minutes I had a lovely time. Then the wind began to tear me
to pieces. I couldn't hear anything but the rush of wind and roar of the car. I could see only
straight ahead. What a road! I never saw a road in my life till to-day. Miles and miles and
miles ahead, with not even a post or tree. That big car seemed to leap at the miles. It hummed
and sang. I was fascinated, then terrified. We went so fast I couldn't catch my breath. The
wind went through me, and I expected to be disrobed by it any minute. I was afraid I couldn't
hold any clothes on. Presently all I could see was a flashing gray wall with a white line in
the middle. Then my eyes blurred. My face burned. My ears grew full of a hundred thousand howling
devils. I was about ready to die when the car stopped. I looked and looked, and when I could
see, there you stood!"

"Helen, I thought you were fond of speeding," said Madeline, with a laugh.

"I was. But I assure you I never before was in a fast car; I never saw a road; I never met
a driver."

"Perhaps I may have a few surprises for you out here in the wild and woolly West."

Helen's dark eyes showed a sister's memory of possibilities.

"You've started well," she said. "I am simply stunned. I expected to find you old and dowdy.
Majesty, you're the handsomest thing I ever laid eyes on. You're so splendid and strong, and
your skin is like white gold. What's happened to you? What's changed you? This beautiful room,
those glorious roses out there, the cool, dark sweetness of this wonderful house! I know you,
Majesty, and, though you never wrote it, I believe you have made a home out here. That's the
most stunning surprise of all. Come, confess. I know I've always been selfish and not much
of a sister; but if you are happy out here I am glad. You were not happy at home. Tell me about
yourself and about Alfred. Then I shall give you all the messages and news from the East."

It afforded Madeline exceeding pleasure to have from one and all of her guests varied encomiums
of her beautiful home, and a real and warm interest in what promised to be a delightful and
memorable visit.

Of them all Castleton was the only one who failed to show surprise. He greeted her precisely
as he had when he had last seen her in London. Madeline, rather to her astonishment, found
meeting him again pleasurable. She discovered she liked this imperturbable Englishman. Manifestly
her capacity for liking any one had immeasurably enlarged. Quite unexpectedly her old girlish
love for her younger sister sprang into life, and with it interest in these half-forgotten
friends, and a warm regard for Edith Wayne, a chum of college days.

Helen's party was smaller than Madeline had expected it to be. Helen had been careful to select
a company of good friends, all of whom were well known to Madeline. Edith Wayne was a patrician
brunette, a serious, soft-voiced woman, sweet and kindly, despite a rather bitter experience
that had left her worldly wise. Mrs. Carrollton Beck, a plain, lively person, had chaperoned
the party. The fourth and last of the feminine contingent was Miss Dorothy Coombs--Dot, as
they called her--a young woman of attractive blond prettiness.

For a man Castleton was of very small stature. He had a pink-and-white complexion, a small
golden mustache, and his heavy eyelids, always drooping, made him look dull. His attire, cut
to what appeared to be an exaggerated English style, attracted attention to his diminutive
size. He was immaculate and fastidious. Robert Weede was a rather large florid young man, remarkable
only for his good nature. Counting Boyd Harvey, a handsome, pale-faced fellow, with the careless
smile of the man for whom life had been easy and pleasant, the party was complete.

Dinner was a happy hour, especially for the Mexican women who served it and who could not fail
to note its success. The mingling of low voices and laughter, the old, gay, superficial talk,
the graciousness of a class which lived for the pleasure of things and to make time pass pleasurably
for others--all took Madeline far back into the past. She did not care to return to it, but
she saw that it was well she had not wholly cut herself off from her people and friends.

When the party adjourned to the porch the heat had markedly decreased and the red sun was sinking
over the red desert. An absence of spoken praise, a gradually deepening silence, attested to
the impression on the visitors of that noble sunset. Just as the last curve of red rim vanished
beyond the dim Sierra Madres and the golden lightning began to flare brighter Helen broke the
silence with an exclamation.

 Too easy
fer me! Them fellers back in Missouri were a lot of cheap dubs, anyhow, always kickin' because
whenever I hit a ball hard I always lost it. Why, I hed to hit sort of left-handed to let 'em
stay in my class. Now you-all can go ahead an' play Monty an' Link. I could beat 'em both,
playin' with one hand, if I wanted to. But I ain't interested. I jest hit thet ball off the
mesa to show you. I sure wouldn't be seen playin' on your team."

With that Nick sauntered away toward the horses. Stillwell appeared crushed. And not a scornful
word was hurled after Nick, which fact proved the nature of his victory. Then Nels strode into
the limelight. As far as it was possible for this iron-faced cowboy to be so, he was bland
and suave. He remarked to Stillwell and the other cowboys that sometimes it was painful for
them to judge of the gifts of superior cowboys such as belonged to Nick and himself. He picked
up the club Nick had used and called for a new ball. Stillwell carefully built up a little
mound of sand and, placing the ball upon it, squared away to watch. He looked grim and expectant.

Nels was not so large a man as Nick, and did not look so formidable as he waved his club at
the gaping cowboys. Still he was lithe, tough, strong. Briskly, with a debonair manner, he
stepped up and then delivered a mighty swing at the ball. He missed. The power and momentum
of his swing flung him off his feet, and he actually turned upside down and spun round on his
head. The cowboys howled. Stillwell's stentorian laugh rolled across the mesa. Madeline and
her guests found it impossible to restrain their mirth. And when Nels got up he cast a reproachful
glance at Madeline. His feelings were hurt.

His second attempt, not by any means so violent, resulted in as clean a miss as the first,
and brought jeers from the cowboys. Nels's red face flamed redder. Angrily he swung again.
The mound of sand spread over the teeing-ground and the exasperating little ball rolled a few
inches. This time he had to build up the sand mound and replace the ball himself. Stillwell
stood scornfully by, and the boys addressed remarks to Nels.

"Take off them blinders," said one.

"Nels, your eyes are shore bad," said another.

"You don't hit where you look."

"Nels, your left eye has sprung a limp."

"Why, you dog-goned old fule, you cain't hit thet bawl."

Nels essayed again, only to meet ignominious failure. Then carefully he gathered himself together,
gaged distance, balanced the club, swung cautiously. And the head of the club made a beautiful
curve round the ball.

"Shore it's jest thet crooked club," he declared.

He changed clubs and made another signal failure. Rage suddenly possessing him, he began to
swing wildly. Always, it appeared, the illusive little ball was not where he aimed. Stillwell
hunched his huge bulk, leaned hands on knees, and roared his riotous mirth. The cowboys leaped
up and down in glee.

"You cain't hit thet bawl," sang out one of the noisiest. A few more whirling, desperate lunges
on the part of Nels, all as futile as if the ball had been thin air, finally brought to the
dogged cowboy a realization that golf was beyond him.

Stillwell bawled: "Oh, haw, haw, haw! Nels, you're--too old--eyes no good!"

Nels slammed down the club, and when he straightened up with the red leaving his face, then
the real pride and fire of the man showed. Deliberately he stepped off ten paces and turned
toward the little mound upon which rested the ball. His arm shot down, elbow crooked, hand
like a claw.

"Aw, Nels, this is fun!" yelled Stillwell.

But swift as a gleam of light Nels flashed his gun, and the report came with the action. Chips
flew from the golf-ball as it tumbled from the mound. Nels had hit it without raising the dust.
Then he dropped the gun back in its sheath and faced the cowboys.

"Mebbe my eyes ain't so orful bad," he said, coolly, and started to walk off.

"But look ah-heah, Nels," yelled Stillwell, "we come out to play gol-lof! We can't let you
knock the ball around with your gun. What'd you want to get mad for? It's only fun. Now you
an' Nick hang round heah an' be sociable. We ain't depreciatin' your company none, nor your
usefulness on occasions. An' if you just hain't got inborn politeness sufficient to do the
gallant before the ladies, why, remember Stewart's orders."

"Stewart's orders?" queried Nels, coming to a sudden halt.

"That's what I said," replied Stillwell, with asperity. "His orders. Are you forgettin' orders?
Wal, you're a fine cowboy. You an' Nick an' Monty, 'specially, are to obey orders."

Nels took off his sombrero and scratched his head. "Bill, I reckon I'm some forgetful. But
I was mad. I'd 'a' remembered pretty soon, an' mebbe my manners."

"Sure you would," replied Stillwell. "Wal, now, we don't seem to be proceedin' much with my
gol-lof team. Next ambitious player step up."

In Ambrose, who showed some skill in driving, Stillwell found one of his team. The succeeding
players, however, were so poor and so evenly matched that the earnest Stillwell was in despair.
He lost his temper just as speedily as Nels had. Finally Ed Linton's wife appeared riding up
with Ambrose's wife, and perhaps this helped, for Ed suddenly disclosed ability that made Stillwell
single him out.

"Let me coach you a little," said Bill.

"Sure, if you like," replied Ed. "But I know more about this game than you do."

"Wal, then, let's see you hit a ball straight. Seems to me you got good all-fired quick. It's
amazin' strange." ere Bill looked around to discover the two young wives modestly casting eyes
of admiration upon their husbands. "Haw, haw! It ain't so darned strange. Mebbe that'll help
some. Now, Ed, stand up and don't sling your club as if you was ropin' a steer. Come round
easy-like an' hit straight."

Ed made several attempts which, although better than those of his predecessors, were rather
discouraging to the exacting coach. Presently, after a particularly atrocious shot, Stillwell
strode in distress here and there, and finally stopped a dozen paces or more in front of the
teeing-ground. Ed, who for a cowboy was somewhat phlegmatic, calmly made ready for another attempt.

"Fore!" he called.

Stillwell stared.

"Fore!" yelled Ed.

"Why're you hollerin' that way at me?" demanded Bill.

"I mean for you to lope off the horizon. Get back from in front."

"Oh, that was one of them durned crazy words Monty is always hollerin'. Wal, I reckon I'm safe
enough hyar. You couldn't hit me in a million years."

"Bill, ooze away," urged Ed.

"Didn't I say you couldn't hit me? What am I coachin' you for? It's because you hit crooked,
ain't it? Wal, go ahaid an' break your back."

Ed Linton was a short, heavy man, and his stocky build gave evidence of considerable strength.
His former strokes had not been made at the expense of exertion, but now he got ready for a
supreme effort. A sudden silence clamped down upon the exuberant cowboys. It was one of those
fateful moments when the air was charged with disaster. As Ed swung the club it fairly whistled.

Crack! Instantly came a thump. But no one saw the ball until it dropped from Stillwell's shrinking
body. His big hands went spasmodically to the place that hurt, and a terrible groan rumbled
from him.

Then the cowboys broke into a frenzy of mirth that seemed to find adequate expression only
in dancing and rolling accompaniment to their howls. Stillwell recovered his dignity as soon
as he caught his breath, and he advanced with a rueful face.

"Wal, boys, it's on Bill," he said. "I'm a livin' proof of the pig-headedness of mankind. Ed,
you win. You're captain of the team. You hit straight, an' if I hadn't been obstructin' the
general atmosphere that ball would sure have gone clear to the Chiricahuas."

Then making a megaphone of his huge hands, he yelled a loud blast of defiance at Monty and Link.

"Hey, you swell gol-lofers! We're waitin'. Come on if you ain't scared."

Instantly Monty and Link quit practising, and like two emperors came stalking across the links.

"Guess my bluff didn't work much," said Stillwell. Then he turned to Madeline and her friends.
"Sure I hope, Miss Majesty, that you-all won't weaken an' go over to the enemy. Monty is some
eloquent, an', besides, he has a way of gettin' people to agree with him. He'll be plumb wild
when he heahs what he an' Link are up against. But it's a square deal, because he wouldn't
help us or lend the book that shows how to play. An', besides, it's policy for us to beat him.
Now, if you'll elect who's to be caddies an' umpire I'll be powerful obliged."

Madeline's friends were hugely amused over the prospective match; but, except for Dorothy and
Castleton, they disclaimed any ambition for active participation. Accordingly, Madeline appointed
Castleton to judge the play, Dorothy to act as caddie for Ed Linton, and she herself to be
caddie for Ambrose. While Stillwell beamingly announced this momentous news to his team and
supporters Monty and Link were striding up.

Both were diminutive in size, bow-legged, lame in one foot, and altogether unprepossessing.
Link was young, and Monty's years, more than twice Link's, had left their mark. But it would
have been impossible to tell Monty's age. As Stillwell said, Monty was burned to the color
and hardness of a cinder. He never minded the heat, and always wore heavy sheepskin chaps with
the wool outside. This made him look broader than he was long. Link, partial to leather, had,
since he became Madeline's chauffeur, taken to leather altogether. He carried no weapon, but
Monty wore a huge gun-sheath and gun. Link smoked a cigarette and looked coolly impudent. Monty
was dark-faced, swaggering, for all the world like a barbarian chief.

"That Monty makes my flesh creep," said Helen, low-voiced. "Really, Mr. Stillwell, is he so
bad--desperate--as I've heard? Did he ever kill anybody?"

"Sure. 'Most as many as Nels," replied Stillwell, cheerfully.

"Oh! And is that nice Mr. Nels a desperado, too? I wouldn't have thought so. He's so kind and
old-fashioned and soft-voiced."

"Nels is sure an example of the dooplicity of men, Miss Helen. Don't you listen to his soft
voice. He's really as bad as a side-winder rattlesnake."

At this juncture Monty and Link reached the teeing-ground, and Stillwell went out to meet them.
The other cowboys pressed forward to surround the trio. Madeline heard Stillwell's voice, and
evidently he was explaining that his team was to have skilled advice during the play. Suddenly
there came from the center of the group a loud, angry roar that broke off as suddenly. Then
followed excited voices all mingled together. Presently Monty appeared, breaking away from
restraining hands, and he strode toward Madeline.

Monty Price was a type of cowboy who had never been known to speak to a woman unless he was
first addressed, and then he answered in blunt, awkward shyness. Upon this great occasion,
however, it appeared that he meant to protest or plead with Madeline, for he showed stress
of emotion. Madeline had never gotten acquainted with Monty. She was a little in awe, if not
in fear, of him, and now she found it imperative for her to keep in mind that more than any
other of the wild fellows on her ranch this one should be dealt with as if he were a big boy.

Monty removed his sombrero--something he had never done before--and the single instant when
it was off was long enough to show his head entirely bald. This was one of the hall-marks of
that terrible Montana prairie fire through which he had fought to save the life of a child.
Madeline did not forget it, and all at once she wanted to take Monty's side. Remembering Stillwell's
wisdom, however, she forebore yielding to sentiment, and called upon her wits.

"Miss--Miss Hammond," began Monty, stammering, "I'm extendin' admirin' greetin's to you an'
your friends. Link an' me are right down proud to play the match game with you watchin'. But
Bill says you're goin' to caddie for his team an' coach 'em on the fine points. An' I want
to ask, all respectful, if thet's fair an' square?"

"Monty, that is for you to say," replied Madeline. "It was my suggestion. But if you object
in the least, of course we shall withdraw. It seems fair to me, because you have learned the
game; you are expert, and I understand the other boys have no chance with you. Then you have
coached Link. I think it would be sportsmanlike of you to accept the handicap."

"Aw, a handicap! Thet was what Bill was drivin' at. Why didn't he say so? Every time Bill comes
to a word thet's pie to us old golfers he jest stumbles. Miss Majesty, you've made it all clear
as print. An' I may say with becomin' modesty thet you wasn't mistaken none about me bein'
sportsmanlike. Me an' Link was born thet way. An' we accept the handicap. Lackin' thet handicap,
I reckon Link an' me would have no ambish to play our most be-ootiful game. An' thankin' you,
Miss Majesty, an' all your friends, I want to add thet if Bill's outfit couldn't beat us before,
they've got a swell chanct now, with you ladies a-watchin' me an' Link."

Monty had seemed to expand with pride as he delivered this speech, and at the end he bowed
low and turned away. He joined the group round Stillwell. Once more there was animated discussion
and argument and expostulation. One of the cowboys came for Castleton and led him away to exploit
upon ground rules.

It seemed to Madeline that the game never would begin. She strolled on the rim of the mesa,
arm in arm with Edith Wayne, and while Edith talked she looked out over the gray valley leading
to the rugged black mountains and the vast red wastes. In the foreground on the gray slope
she saw cattle in movement and cowboys riding to and fro. She thought of Stewart. Then Boyd
Harvey came for them, saying all details had been arranged. Stillwell met them half-way, and
this cool, dry, old cattleman, whose face and manner scarcely changed at the announcement of
a cattle-raid, now showed extreme agitation.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, we've gone an' made a foozle right at the start," he said, dejectedly.

"A foozle? But the game has not yet begun," replied Madeline.

"A bad start, I mean. It's amazin' bad, an' we're licked already."

"What in the world is wrong?"

She wanted to laugh, but Stillwell's distress restrained her.

"Wal, it's this way. That darn Monty is as cute an' slick as a fox. After he got done declaimin'
about the handicap he an' Link was so happy to take, he got Castleton over hyar an' drove us
all dotty with his crazy gol-lof names. Then he borrowed Castleton's gol-lof coat. I reckon
borrowed is some kind word. He just about took that blazin' coat off the Englishman. Though
I ain't sayin' but that Casleton was agreeable when he tumbled to Monty's meanin'. Which was
nothin' more 'n to break Ambrose's heart. That coat dazzles Ambrose. You know how vain Ambrose
is. Why, he'd die to get to wear that Englishman's gol-lof coat. An' Monty forestalled him.
It's plumb pitiful to see the look in Ambrose's eyes. He won't be able to play much. Then what
do you think? Monty fixed Ed Linton, all right. Usually Ed is easy-goin' an' cool. But now
he's on the rampage. Wal, mebbe it's news to you to learn that Ed's wife is powerful, turrible
jealous of him. Ed was somethin' of a devil with the wimmen. Monty goes over an' tells Beulah--that's
Ed's wife--that Ed is goin' to have for caddie the lovely Miss Dorothy with the goo-goo eyes.
I reckon this was some disrespectful, but with all doo respect to Miss Dorothy she has got
a pair of unbridled eyes. Mebbe it's just natural for her to look at a feller like that. Oh,
it's all right; I'm not sayin' any-thin'! I know it's all proper an' regular for girls back
East to use their eyes. But out hyar it's bound to result disastrous. All the boys talk about
among themselves is Miss Dot's eyes, an' all they brag about is which feller is the luckiest.
Anyway, sure Ed's wife knows it. An' Monty up an' told her that it was fine for her to come
out an' see how swell Ed was prancin' round under the light of Miss Dot's brown eyes. Beulah
calls over Ed, figgertively speakin', ropes him for a minnit. Ed comes back huggin' a grouch
as big as a hill. Oh, it was funny! He was goin' to punch Monty's haid off. An' Monty stands
there an' laughs. Says Monty, sarcastic as alkali water: 'Ed, we-all knowed you was a heap
married man, but you're some locoed to give yourself away.' That settled Ed. He's some touchy
about the way Beulah henpecks him. He lost his spirit. An' now he couldn't play marbles, let
alone gol-lof. Nope, Monty was too smart. An' I reckon he was right about brains bein' what wins."

The game began. At first Madeline and Dorothy essayed to direct the endeavors of their respective
players. But all they said and did only made their team play the worse. At the third hole they
were far behind and hopelessly bewildered. What with Monty's borrowed coat, with its dazzling
effect upon Ambrose, and Link's oft-repeated allusion to Ed's matrimonial state, and Stillwell's
vociferated disgust, and the clamoring good intention and pursuit of the cowboy supporters,
and the embarrassing presence of the ladies, Ambrose and Ed wore through all manner of strange
play until it became ridiculous.

"Hey, Link," came Monty's voice booming over the links, "our esteemed rivals are playin' shinny."

Madeline and Dorothy gave up, presently, when the game became a rout, and they sat down with
their followers to watch the fun. Whether by hook or crook, Ed and Ambrose forged ahead to
come close upon Monty and Link. Castleton disappeared in a mass of gesticulating, shouting
cowboys. When that compact mass disintegrated Castleton came forth rather hurriedly, it appeared,
to stalk back toward his hostess and friends.

"Look!" exclaimed Helen, in delight. "Castleton is actually excited. Whatever did they do to
him? Oh, this is immense!"

Castleton was excited, indeed, and also somewhat disheveled.

"By Jove! that was a rum go," he said, as he came up. "Never saw such blooming golf! I resigned
my office as umpire."

Only upon considerable pressure did he reveal the reason. "It was like this, don't you know.
They were all together over there, watching each other. Monty Price's ball dropped into a hazard,
and he moved it to improve the lie. By Jove! they've all been doing that. But over there the
game was waxing hot. Stillwell and his cowboys saw Monty move the ball, and there was a row.
They appealed to me. I corrected the play, showed the rules. Monty agreed he was in the wrong.
However, when it came to moving his ball back to its former lie in the hazard there was more
blooming trouble. Monty placed the ball to suit him, and then he transfixed me with an evil eye.

"'Dook,' he said. I wish the bloody cowboy would not call me that. 'Dook, mebbe this game ain't
as important as international politics or some other things relatin', but there's some health
an' peace dependin' on it. Savvy? For some space our opponents have been dead to honor an'
sportsmanlike conduct. I calculate the game depends on my next drive. I'm placin' my ball as
near to where it was as human eyesight could. You seen where it was same as I seen it. You're
the umpire, an', Dook, I take you as a honorable man. Moreover, never in my born days has my
word been doubted without sorrow. So I'm askin' you, wasn't my ball layin' just about here?'

"The bloody little desperado smiled cheerfully, and he dropped his right hand down to the butt
of his gun. By Jove, he did! Then I had to tell a blooming lie!"

Castleton even caught the tone of Monty's voice, but it was plain that he had not the least
conception that Monty had been fooling. Madeline and her friends divined it, however; and,
there being no need of reserve, they let loose the fountains of mirth.

XIV. Bandits

When Madeline and her party recovered composure they sat up to watch the finish of the match.
It came with spectacular suddenness. A sharp yell pealed out, and all the cowboys turned attentively
in its direction. A big black horse had surmounted the rim of the mesa and was just breaking
into a run. His rider yelled sharply to the cowboys. They wheeled to dash toward their grazing
horses.

"That's Stewart. There is something wrong," said Madeline, in alarm.

Castleton stared. The other men exclaimed uneasily. The women sought Madeline's face with anxious
eyes.

The black got into his stride and bore swiftly down upon them.

"Oh, look at that horse run!" cried Helen. "Look at that fellow ride!"

Helen was not alone in her admiration, for Madeline divided her emotions between growing alarm
of some danger menacing and a thrill and quickening of pulse-beat that tingled over her whenever
she saw Stewart in violent action. No action of his was any longer insignificant, but violent
action meant so much. It might mean anything. For one moment she remembered Stillwell and all
his talk about fun, and plots, and tricks to amuse her guest. Then she discountenanced the
thought. Stewart might lend himself to a little fun, but he cared too much for a horse to run
him at that speed unless there was imperious need. That alone sufficed to answer Madeline's
questioning curiosity. And her alarm mounted to fear not so much for herself as for her guests.
But what danger could there be? She could think of nothing except the guerrillas.

Whatever threatened, it would be met and checked by this man Stewart, who was thundering up
on his fleet horse; and as he neared her, so that she could see the dark gleam of face and
eyes, she had a strange feeling of trust in her dependence upon him.

The big black was so close to Madeline and her friends that when Stewart pulled him the dust
and sand kicked up by his pounding hoofs flew in their faces.

"Oh, Stewart, what is it?" cried Madeline.

"Guess I scared you, Miss Hammond," he replied. "But I'm pressed for time. There's a gang of
bandits hiding on the ranch, most likely in a deserted hut. They held up a train near Agua
Prieta. Pat Hawe is with the posse that's trailing them, and you know Pat has no use for us.
I'm afraid it wouldn't be pleasant for you or your guests to meet either the posse or the bandits."

"I fancy not," said Madeline, considerably relieved. "We'll hurry back to the house."

They exchanged no more speech at the moment, and Madeline's guests were silent. Perhaps Stewart's
actions and looks belied his calm words. His piercing eyes roved round the rim of the mesa,
and his face was as hard and stern as chiseled bronze.

Monty and Nick came galloping up, each leading several horses by the bridles. Nels appeared
behind them with Majesty, and he was having trouble with the roan. Madeline observed that all
the other cowboys had disappeared.

One sharp word from Stewart calmed Madeline's horse; the other horses, however, were frightened
and not inclined to stand. The men mounted without trouble, and likewise Madeline and Florence.
But Edith Wayne and Mrs. Beck, being nervous and almost helpless, were with difficulty gotten
into the saddle.

"Beg pardon, but I'm pressed for time," said Stewart, coolly, as with iron arm he forced Dorothy's
horse almost to its knees. Dorothy, who was active and plucky, climbed astride; and when Stewart
loosed his hold on bit and mane the horse doubled up and began to buck. Dorothy screamed as
she shot into the air. Stewart, as quick as the horse, leaped forward and caught Dorothy in
his arms. She had slipped head downward and, had he not caught her, would have had a serious
fall. Stewart, handling her as if she were a child, turned her right side up to set her upon
her feet. Dorothy evidently thought only of the spectacle she presented, and made startled
motions to readjust her riding-habit. It was no time to laugh, though Madeline felt as if she
wanted to. Besides, it was impossible to be anything but sober with Stewart in violent mood.
For he had jumped at Dorothy's stubborn mount. All cowboys were masters of horses. It was wonderful
to see him conquer the vicious animal. He was cruel, perhaps, yet it was from necessity. When,
presently, he led the horse back to Dorothy she mounted without further trouble. Meanwhile,
Nels and Nick had lifted Helen into her saddle.

"We'll take the side trail," said Stewart, shortly, as he swung upon the big black. Then he
led the way, and the other cowboys trotted in the rear.

It was only a short distance to the rim of the mesa, and when Madeline saw the steep trail,
narrow and choked with weathered stone, she felt that her guests would certainly flinch.

"That's a jolly bad course," observed Castleton.

The women appeared to be speechless.

Stewart checked his horse at the deep cut where the trail started down.

"Boys, drop over, and go slow," he said, dismounting. "Flo, you follow. Now, ladies, let your
horses loose and hold on. Lean forward and hang to the pommel. It looks bad. But the horses
are used to such trails."

Helen followed closely after Florence; Mrs. Beck went next, and then Edith Wayne. Dorothy's
horse balked.

"I'm not so--so frightened," said Dorothy. "If only he would behave!"

She began to urge him into the trail, making him rear, when Stewart grasped the bit and jerked
the horse down.

"Put your foot in my stirrup," said Stewart. "We can't waste time."

He lifted her upon his horse and started him down over the rim.

"Go on, Miss Hammond. I'll have to lead this nag down. It'll save time."

Then Madeline attended to the business of getting down herself. It was a loose trail. The weathered
slopes seemed to slide under the feet of the horses. Dust-clouds formed; rocks rolled and rattled
down; cactus spikes tore at horse and rider. Mrs. Beck broke into laughter, and there was a
note in it that suggested hysteria. Once or twice Dorothy murmured plaintively. Half the time
Madeline could not distinguish those ahead through the yellow dust. It was dry and made her
cough. The horses snorted. She heared Stewart close behind, starting little avalanches that
kept rolling on Majesty's fetlocks. She feared his legs might be cut or bruised, for some of
the stones cracked by and went rattling down the slope. At length the clouds of dust thinned
and Madeline saw the others before her ride out upon a level. Soon she was down, and Stewart also.

Here there was a delay, occasioned by Stewart changing Dorothy from his horse to her own. This
struck Madeline as being singular, and made her thoughtful. In fact, the alert, quiet manner
of all the cowboys was not reassuring. As they resumed the ride it was noticeable that Nels
and Nick were far in advance, Monty stayed far in the rear, and Stewart rode with the party.
Madeline heard Boyd Harvey ask Stewart if lawlessness such as he had mentioned was not unusual.
Stewart replied that, except for occasional deeds of outlawry such as might break out in any
isolated section of the country, there had been peace and quiet along the border for years.
It was the Mexican revolution that had revived wild times, with all the attendant raids and
holdups and gun-packing. Madeline knew that they were really being escorted home under armed guard.

When they rounded the head of the mesa, bringing into view the ranch-house and the valley,
Madeline saw dust or smoke hovering over a hut upon the outskirts of the Mexican quarters.
As the sun had set and the light was fading, she could not distinguish which it was. Then Stewart
set a fast pace for the house. In a few minutes the party was in the yard, ready and willing
to dismount.

Stillwell appeared, ostensibly cheerful, too cheerful to deceive Madeline. She noted also that
a number of armed cowboys were walking with their horses just below the house.

"Wal, you-all had a nice little run," Stillwell said, speaking generally. "I reckon there wasn't
much need of it. Pat Hawe thinks he's got some outlaws corralled on the ranch. Nothin' at all
to be fussed up about. Stewart's that particular he won't have you meetin' with any rowdies."

Many and fervent were the expressions of relief from Madeline's feminine guests as they dismounted
and went into the house. Madeline lingered behind to speak with Stillwell and Stewart.

"Now, Stillwell, out with it," she said, briefly.

The cattleman stared, and then he laughed, evidently pleased with her keenness.

"Wal, Miss Majesty, there's goin' to be a fight somewhere, an' Stewart wanted to get you-all
in before it come off. He says the valley's overrun by vaqueros an' guerrillas an' robbers,
an' Lord knows what else."

He stamped off the porch, his huge spurs rattling, and started down the path toward the waiting
men.

Stewart stood in his familiar attentive position, erect, silent, with a hand on pommel and bridle.

"Stewart, you are exceedingly--thoughtful of my interests," she said, wanting to thank him,
and not readily finding words. "I would not know what to do without you. Is there danger?"

"I'm not sure. But I want to be on the safe side."

She hesitated. It was no longer easy for her to talk to him, and she did not know why.

"May I know the special orders you gave Nels and Nick and Monty?" she asked.

"Who said I gave those boys special orders?"

"I heard Stillwell tell them so."

"Of course I'll tell you if you insist. But why should you worry over something that'll likely
never happen?"

"I insist, Stewart," she replied, quietly.

"My orders were that at least one of them must be on guard near you day and night--never to
be out of hearing of your voice."

"I thought as much. But why Nels or Monty or Nick? That seems rather hard on them. For that
matter, why put any one to keep guard over me? Do you not trust any other of my cowboys?"

"I'd trust their honesty, but not their ability."

"Ability? Of what nature?"

"With guns."

"Stewart!" she exclaimed.

"Miss Hammond, you have been having such a good time entertaining your guests that you forget.
I'm glad of that. I wish you had not questioned me."

"Forget what?"

"Don Carlos and his guerrillas."

"Indeed I have not forgotten. Stewart, you still think Don Carlos tried to make off with me--may
try it again?"

"I don't think. I know."

"And besides all your other duties you have shared the watch with these three cowboys?"

"Yes."

"It has been going on without my knowledge?"

"Yes."

"Since when?"

"Since I brought you down from the mountains last month."

"How long is it to continue?"

"That's hard to say. Till the revolution is over, anyhow."

She mused a moment, looking away to the west, where the great void was filling with red haze.
She believed implicitly in him, and the menace hovering near her fell like a shadow upon her
present happiness.

"What must I do?" she asked.

"I think you ought to send your friends back East--and go with them, until this guerrilla war
is over."

"Why, Stewart, they would be broken-hearted, and so would I."

He had no reply for that.

"If I do not take your advice it will be the first time since I have come to look to you for
so much," she went on. "Cannot you suggest something else? My friends are having such a splendid
visit. Helen is getting well. Oh, I should be sorry to see them go before they want to."

"We might take them up into the mountains and camp out for a while," he said, presently. "I
know a wild place up among the crags. It's a hard climb, but worth the work. I never saw a
more beautiful spot. Fine water, and it will be cool. Pretty soon it'll be too hot here for
your party to go out-of-doors."

"You mean to hide me away among the crags and clouds?" replied Madeline, with a laugh.

"Well, it'd amount to that. Your friends need not know. Perhaps in a few weeks this spell of
trouble on the border will be over till fall."

"You say it's a hard climb up to this place?"

"It surely is. Your friends will get the real thing if they make that trip."

"That suits me. Helen especially wants something to happen. And they are all crazy for excitement."

"They'd get it up there. Bad trails, canyons to head, steep climbs, wind-storms, thunder and
lightning, rain, mountain-lions and wildcats."

"Very well, I am decided. Stewart, of course you will take charge? I don't believe I--Stewart,
isn't there something more you could tell me--why you think, why you know my own personal liberty
is in peril?"

"Yes. But do not ask me what it is. If I hadn't been a rebel soldier I would never have known."

"If you had not been a rebel soldier, where would Madeline Hammond be now?" she asked, earnestly.

He made no reply.

"Stewart," she continued, with warm impulse, "you once mentioned a debt you owed me--" And
seeing his dark face pale, she wavered, then went on. "It is paid."

"No, no," he answered, huskily.

"Yes. I will not have it otherwise."

"No. That never can be paid."

Madeline held out her hand.

"It is paid, I tell you," she repeated.

Suddenly he drew back from the outstretched white hand that seemed to fascinate him.

"I'd kill a man to touch your hand. But I won't touch it on the terms you offer."

His unexpected passion disconcerted her.

"Stewart, no man ever before refused to shake hands with me, for any reason. It--it is scarcely
flattering," she said, with a little laugh. "Why won't you? Because you think I offer it as
mistress to servant--rancher to cowboy?"

"No."

"Then why? The debt you owed me is paid. I cancel it. So why not shake hands upon it, as men do?"

"I won't. That's all."

"I fear you are ungracious, whatever your reason," she replied. "Still, I may offer it again
some day. Good night."

He said good night and turned. Madeline wonderingly watched him go down the path with his hand
on the black horse's neck.

She went in to rest a little before dressing for dinner, and, being fatigued from the day's
riding and excitement, she fell asleep. When she awoke it was twilight. She wondered why her
Mexican maid had not come to her, and she rang the bell. The maid did not put in an appearance,
nor was there any answer to the ring. The house seemed unusually quiet. It was a brooding silence,
which presently broke to the sound of footsteps on the porch. Madeline recognized Stillwell's
tread, though it appeared to be light for him. Then she heard him call softly in at the open
door of her office. The suggestion of caution in his voice suited the strangeness of his walk.
With a boding sense of trouble she hurried through the rooms. He was standing outside her office
door.

"Stillwell!" she exclaimed.

"Anybody with you?" he asked, in a low tone.

"No."

"Please come out on the porch," he added.

She complied, and, once out, was enabled to see him. His grave face, paler than she had ever
beheld it, caused her to stretch an appealing hand toward him. Stillwell intercepted it and
held it in his own.

"Miss Majesty, I'm amazin' sorry to tell worrisome news." He spoke almost in a whisper, cautiously
looked about him, and seemed both hurried and mysterious. "If you'd heerd Stewart cuss you'd
sure know how we hate to hev to tell you this. But it can't be avoided. The fact is we're in
a bad fix. If your guests ain't scared out of their skins it'll be owin' to your nerve an'
how you carry out Stewart's orders."

"You can rely upon me," replied Madeline, firmly, though she trembled.

"Wal, what we're up against is this: that gang of bandits Pat Hawe was chasin'--they're hidin'
in the house!"

"In the house?" echoed Madeline, aghast.

"Miss Majesty, it's the amazin' truth, an' shamed indeed am I to admit it. Stewart--why, he's
wild with rage to think it could hev happened. You see, it couldn't hev happened if I hedn't
sloped the boys off to the gol-lof-links, an' if Stewart hedn't rid out on the mesa after us.
It's my fault. I've hed too much femininity around fer my old haid. Gene cussed me--he cussed
me sure scandalous. But now we've got to face it--to figger."

"Do you mean that a gang of hunted outlaws--bandits--have actually taken refuge somewhere in
my house?" demanded Madeline.

"I sure do. Seems powerful strange to me why you didn't find somethin' was wrong, seem' all
your servants hev sloped."

"Gone? Ah, I missed my maid! I wondered why no lights were lit. Where did my servants go?"

"Down to the Mexican quarters, an' scared half to death. Now listen. When Stewart left you
an hour or so ago he follered me direct to where me an' the boys was tryin' to keep Pat Hawe
from tearin' the ranch to pieces. At that we was helpin' Pat all we could to find them bandits.
But when Stewart got there he made a difference. Pat was nasty before, but seein' Stewart made
him wuss. I reckon Gene to Pat is the same as red to a Greaser bull. Anyway, when the sheriff
set fire to an old adobe hut Stewart called him an' called him hard. Pat Hawe hed six fellers
with him, an' from all appearances bandit-huntin' was some fiesta. There was a row, an 'it
looked bad fer a little. But Gene was cool, an' he controlled the boys. Then Pat an' his tough
de-pooties went on huntin'. That huntin', Miss Majesty, petered out into what was only a farce.
I reckon Pat could hev kept on foolin' me an' the boys, but as soon as Stewart showed up on
the scene--wal, either Pat got to blunderin' or else we-all shed our blinders. Anyway, the
facts stood plain. Pat Hawe wasn't lookin' hard fer any bandits; he wasn't daid set huntin'
anythin', unless it was trouble fer Stewart. Finally, when Pat's men made fer our storehouse,
where we keep ammunition, grub, liquors, an' sich, then Gene called a halt. An' he ordered
Pat Hawe off the ranch. It was hyar Hawe an' Stewart locked horns.

"An' hyar the truth come out. There was a gang of bandits hid somewheres, an' at fust Pat Hawe
hed been powerful active an' earnest in his huntin'. But sudden-like he'd fetched a pecooliar
change of heart. He had been some flustered with Stewart's eyes a-pryin' into his moves, an'
then, mebbe to hide somethin', mebbe jest nat'rul, he got mad. He hollered law. He pulled down
off the shelf his old stock grudge on Stewart, accusin' him over again of that Greaser murder
last fall. Stewart made him look like a fool--showed him up as bein' scared of the bandits
or hevin' some reason fer slopin' off the trail. Anyway, the row started all right, an' but
fer Nels it might hev amounted to a fight. In the thick of it, when Stewart was drivin' Pat
an' his crowd off the place, one of them de-pooties lost his head an' went fer his gun. Nels
throwed his gun an' crippled the feller's arm. Monty jumped then an' throwed two forty-fives,
an' fer a second or so it looked ticklish. But the bandit-hunters crawled, an' then lit out."

Stillwell paused in the rapid delivery of his narrative; he still retained Madeline's hand,
as if by that he might comfort her.

"After Pat left we put our haids together," began the old cattleman, with a long respiration.
"We rounded up a lad who hed seen a dozen or so fellers--he wouldn't to they was Greasers--breakin'
through the shrubbery to the back of the house. That was while Stewart was ridin' out to the
mesa. Then this lad seen your servants all runnin' down the hill toward the village. Now, heah's
the way Gene figgers. There sure was some deviltry down along the railroad, an' Pat Hawe trailed
bandits up to the ranch. He hunts hard an' then all to onct he quits. Stewart says Pat Hawe
wasn't scared, but he discovered signs or somethin', or got wind in some strange way that there
was in the gang of bandits some fellers he didn't want to ketch. Sabe? Then Gene, quicker 'n
a flash, springs his plan on me. He'd go down to Padre Marcos an' hev him help to find out
all possible from your Mexican servants. I was to hurry up hyar an' tell you--give you orders,
Miss Majesty. Ain't that amazin' strange? Wal, you're to assemble all your guests in the kitchen.
Make a grand bluff an' pretend, as your help has left, that it'll be great fun fer your guests
to cook dinner. The kitchen is the safest room in the house. While you're joshin' your party
along, makin' a kind of picnic out of it, I'll place cowboys in the long corridor, an' also
outside in the corner where the kitchen joins on to the main house. It's pretty sure the bandits
think no one's wise to where they're hid. Stewart says they're in that end room where the alfalfa
is, an' they'll slope in the night. Of course, with me an' the boys watchin', you-all will
be safe to go to bed. An' we're to rouse your guests early before daylight, to hit the trail
up into the mountains. Tell them to pack outfits before goin' to bed. Say as your servants
hev sloped, you might as well go campin' with the cowboys. That's all. If we hev any luck your'
friends'll never know they've been sittin' on a powder-mine."

"Stillwell, do you advise that trip up into the mountains?" asked Madeline.

"I reckon I do, considerin' everythin'. Now, Miss Majesty, I've used up a lot of time explainin'.
You'll sure keep your nerve?"

"Yes," Madeline replied, and was surprised at herself. "Better tell Florence. She'll be a power
of comfort to you. I'm goin' now to fetch up the boys."

Instead of returning to her room Madeline went through the office into the long corridor. It
was almost as dark as night. She fancied she saw a slow-gliding figure darker than the surrounding
gloom; and she entered upon the fulfilment of her part of the plan in something like trepidation.
Her footsteps were noiseless. Finding the door to the kitchen, and going in, she struck lights.
Upon passing out again she made certain she discerned a dark shape, now motionless, crouching
along the wall. But she mistrusted her vivid imagination. It took all her boldness to enable
her unconcernedly and naturally to strike the corridor light. Then she went on through her
own rooms and thence into the patio.

Her guests laughingly and gladly entered into the spirit of the occasion. Madeline fancied
her deceit must have been perfect, seeing that it deceived even Florence. They trooped merrily
into the kitchen. Madeline, delaying at the door, took a sharp but unobtrusive glance down
the great, barnlike hall. She saw nothing but blank dark space. Suddenly from one side, not
a rod distant, protruded a pale, gleaming face breaking the even blackness. Instantly it flashed
back out of sight. Yet that time was long enough for Madeline to see a pair of glittering eyes,
and to recognize them as Don Carlos's.

Without betraying either hurry or alarm, she closed the door. It had a heavy bolt which she
slowly, noiselessly shot. Then the cold amaze that had all but stunned her into inaction throbbed
into wrath. How dared that Mexican steal into her home! What did he mean? Was he one of the
bandits supposed to be hidden in her house? She was thinking herself into greater anger and
excitement, and probably would have betrayed herself had not Florence, who had evidently seen
her bolt the door and now read her thoughts, come toward her with a bright, intent, questioning
look. Madeline caught herself in time.

Thereupon she gave each of her guests a duty to perform. Leading Florence into the pantry,
she unburdened herself of the secret in one brief whisper. Florence's reply was to point out
of the little open window, passing which was a file of stealthily moving cowboys. Then Madeline
lost both anger and fear, retaining only the glow of excitement.

Madeline could be gay, and she initiated the abandonment of dignity by calling Castleton into
the pantry, and, while interesting him in some pretext or other, imprinting the outlines of
her flour-covered hands upon the back of his black coat. Castleton innocently returned to the
kitchen to be greeted with a roar. That surprising act of the hostess set the pace, and there
followed a merry, noisy time. Everybody helped. The miscellaneous collection of dishes so confusingly
contrived made up a dinner which they all heartily enjoyed. Madeline enjoyed it herself, even
with the feeling of a sword hanging suspended over her.

The hour was late when she rose from the table and told her guests to go to their rooms, don
their riding-clothes, pack what they needed for the long and adventurous camping trip that
she hoped would be the climax of their Western experience, and to snatch a little sleep before
the cowboys roused them for the early start.

Madeline went immediately to her room, and was getting out her camping apparel when a knock
interrupted her. She thought Florence had come to help her pack. But this knock was upon the
door opening out in the porch. It was repeated.

"Who's there?" she questioned.

"Stewart," came the reply.

She opened the door. He stood on the threshold. Beyond him, indistinct in the gloom, were several
cowboys.

"May I speak to you?" he asked.

"Certainly." She hesitated a moment, then asked him in and closed the door. "Is--is everything
all right?"

"No. These bandits stick to cover pretty close. They must have found out we're on the watch.
But I'm sure we'll get you and your friends away before anything starts. I wanted to tell you
that I've talked with your servants. They were just scared. They'll come back to-morrow, soon
as Bill gets rid of this gang. You need not worry about them or your property."

"Do you have any idea who is hiding in the house?"

"I was worried some at first. Pat Hawe acted queer. I imagined he'd discovered he was trailing
bandits who might turn out to be his smuggling guerrilla cronies. But talking with your servants,
finding a bunch of horses upon hidden down in the mesquite behind the pond--several things
have changed my mind. My idea is that a cowardly handful of riffraff outcasts from the border
have hidden in your house, more by accident than design. We'll let them go--get rid of them
without even a shot. If I didn't think so--well, I'd be considerably worried. It would make
a different state of affairs."

"Stewart, you are wrong," she said.

He started, but his reply did not follow swiftly. The expression of his eyes altered. Presently
he spoke:

"How so?"

"I saw one of these bandits. I distinctly recognized him."

One long step brought him close to her.

"Who was he?" demanded Stewart.

"Don Carlos."

He muttered low and deep, then said, "Are you sure?"

"Absolutely. I saw his figure twice in the hall, then his face in the light. I could never
mistake his eyes."

"Did he know you saw him?"

"I am not positive, but I think so. Oh, he must have known! I was standing full in the light.
I had entered the door, then purposely stepped out. His face showed from around a corner, and
swiftly flashed out of sight."

Madeline was tremblingly conscious that Stewart underwent a transformation. She saw as well
as felt the leaping passion that changed him.

"Call your friends--get them in here!" he ordered, tersely, and wheeled toward the door.

"Stewart, wait!" she said.

He turned. His white face, his burning eyes, his presence now charged with definite, fearful
meaning, influenced her strangely, weakened her.

"What will you do?" she asked.

"That needn't concern you. Get your party in here. Bar the windows and lock the doors. You'll
be safe."

"Stewart! Tell me what you intend to do."

"I won't tell you," he replied, and turned away again.

"But I will know," she said. With a hand on his arm she detained him. She saw how he halted--felt
the shock in him as she touched him. "Oh, I do know. You mean to fight!"

"Well, Miss Hammond, isn't it about time?" he asked. Evidently he overcame a violent passion
for instant action. There was weariness, dignity, even reproof in his question. "The fact of
that Mexican's presence here in your house ought to prove to you the nature of the case. These
vaqueros, these guerrillas, have found out you won't stand for any fighting on the part of
your men. Don Carlos is a sneak, a coward, yet he's not afraid to hide in your own house. He
has learned you won't let your cowboys hurt anybody. He's taking advantage of it. He'll rob,
burn, and make off with you. He'll murder, too, if it falls his way. These Greasers use knives
in the dark. So I ask--isn't it about time we stop him?"

"Stewart, I forbid you to fight, unless in self-defense. I forbid you."

"What I mean to do is self-defense. Haven't I tried to explain to you that just now we've wild
times along this stretch of border? Must I tell you again that Don Carlos is hand and glove
with the revolution? The rebels are crazy to stir up the United States. You are a woman of
prominence. Don Carlos would make off with you. If he got you, what little matter to cross
the border with you! Well, where would the hue and cry go? Through the troops along the border!
To New York! To Washington! Why, it would mean what the rebels are working for--United States
intervention. In other words, war!"

"Oh, surely you exaggerate!" she cried.

"Maybe so. But I'm beginning to see the Don's game. And, Miss Hammond, I--It's awful for me
to think what you'd suffer if Don Carlos got you over the line. I know these low-caste Mexicans.
I've been among the peons--the slaves."

"Stewart, don't let Don Carlos get me," replied Madeline, in sweet directness.

She saw him shake, saw his throat swell as he swallowed hard, saw the hard fierceness return
to his face.

"I won't. That's why I'm going after him."

"But I forbade you to start a fight deliberately."

"Then I'll go ahead and start one without your permission," he replied shortly, and again he
wheeled.

This time, when Madeline caught his arm she held to it, even after he stopped.

"No," she said, imperiously.

He shook off her hand and strode forward.

"Please don't go!" she called, beseechingly. But he kept on. "Stewart!"

She ran ahead of him, intercepted him, faced him with her back against the door. He swept out
a long arm as if to brush her aside. But it wavered and fell. Haggard, troubled, with working
face, he stood before her.

"It's for your sake," he expostulated.

"If it is for my sake, then do what pleases me."

"These guerrillas will knife somebody. They'll burn the house. They'll make off with you. They'll
do something bad unless we stop them."

"Let us risk all that," she importuned.

"But it's a terrible risk, and it oughtn't be run," he exclaimed, passionately. "I know best
here. Stillwell upholds me. Let me out, Miss Hammond. I'm going to take the boys and go after
these guerrillas."

"No!"

"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Stewart. "Why not let me go? It's the thing to do. I'm sorry to distress
you and your guests. Why not put an end to Don Carlos's badgering? Is it because you're afraid
a rumpus will spoil your friends' visit?"

"It isn't--not this time."

"Then it's the idea of a little shooting at these Greasers?"

"No."

"You're sick to think of a little Greaser blood staining the halls of your home?"

"No!"

"Well, then, why keep me from doing what I know is best?"

"Stewart, I--I--" she faltered, in growing agitation. "I'm frightened--confused. All this is
too--too much for me. I'm not a coward. If you have to fight you'll see I'm not a coward. But
your way seems so reckless--that hall is so dark--the guerrillas would shoot from behind doors.
You're so wild, so daring, you'd rush right into peril. Is that necessary? I think--I mean--I
don't know just why I feel so--so about you doing it. But I believe it's because I'm afraid
you--you might be hurt."

"You're afraid I--I might be hurt?" he echoed, wonderingly, the hard whiteness of his face
warming, flushing, glowing.

"Yes."

The single word, with all it might mean, with all it might not mean, softened him as if by
magic, made him gentle, amazed, shy as a boy, stifling under a torrent of emotions.

Madeline thought she had persuaded him--worked her will with him. Then another of his startlingly
sudden moves told her that she had reckoned too quickly. This move was to put her firmly aside
so he could pass; and Madeline, seeing he would not hesitate to lift her out of the way, surrendered
the door. He turned on the threshold. His face was still working, but the flame-pointed gleam
of his eyes indicated the return of that cowboy ruthlessness.

"I'm going to drive Don Carlos and his gang out of the house," declared Stewart. "I think I
may promise you to do it without a fight. But if it takes a fight, off he goes!"

XV. The Mountain Trail

As Stewart departed from one door Florence knocked upon another; and Madeline, far shaken out
of her usual serenity, admitted the cool Western girl with more than gladness. Just to have
her near helped Madeline to get back her balance. She was conscious of Florence's sharp scrutiny,
then of a sweet, deliberate change of manner. Florence might have been burning with curiosity
to know more about the bandits hidden in the house, the plans of the cowboys, the reason for
Madeline's suppressed emotion; but instead of asking Madeline questions she introduced the
important subject of what to take on the camping trip. For an hour they discussed the need
of this and that article, selected those things most needful, and then packed them in Madeline's
duffle-bags.

That done, they decided to lie down, fully dressed as they were in riding-costume, and sleep,
or at least rest, the little remaining time left before the call to saddle. Madeline turned
out the light and, peeping through her window, saw dark forms standing sentinel-like in the
gloom. When she lay down she heard soft steps on the path. This fidelity to her swelled her
heart, while the need of it presaged that fearful something which, since Stewart's passionate
appeal to her, haunted her as inevitable.

Madeline did not expect to sleep, yet she did sleep, and it seemed to have been only a moment
until Florence called her. She followed Florence outside. It was the dark hour before dawn.
She could discern saddled horses being held by cowboys. There was an air of hurry and mystery
about the departure. Helen, who came tip-toeing out with Madeline's other guests, whispered
that it was like an escape. She was delighted. The others were amused. To Madeline it was indeed
an escape.

In the darkness Madeline could not see how many escorts her party was to have. She heard low
voices, the champing of bits and thumping of hoofs, and she recognized Stewart when he led
up Majesty for her to mount. Then came a pattering of soft feet and the whining of dogs. Cold
noses touched her hands, and she saw the long, gray, shaggy shapes of her pack of Russian wolf-hounds.
That Stewart meant to let them go with her was indicative of how he studied her pleasure. She
loved to be out with the hounds and her horse.

Stewart led Majesty out into the darkness past a line of mounted horses.

"Guess we're ready?" he said. "I'll make the count." He went back along the line, and on the
return Madeline heard him say several times, "Now, everybody ride close to the horse in front,
and keep quiet till daylight." Then the snorting and pounding of the big black horse in front
of her told Madeline that Stewart had mounted.

"All right, we're off," he called.

Madeline lifted Majesty's bridle and let the roan go. There was a crack and crunch of gravel,
fire struck from stone, a low whinny, a snort, and then steady, short, clip-clop of iron hoofs
on hard ground. Madeline could just discern Stewart and his black outlined in shadowy gray
before her. Yet they were almost within touching distance. Once or twice one of the huge stag-hounds
leaped up at her and whined joyously. A thick belt of darkness lay low, and seemed to thin
out above to a gray fog, through which a few wan stars showed. It was altogether an unusual
departure from the ranch; and Madeline, always susceptible even to ordinary incident that promised
well, now found herself thrillingly sensitive to the soft beat of hoofs, the feel of cool,
moist air, the dim sight of Stewart's dark figure. Nucleotide 17.

 "I am simply ravenous. This air makes me hungry."

For that matter, Madeline observed Helen did not show any marked contrast to the others. The
hurry order, however, did not interfere with the meal being somewhat in the nature of a picnic.
While they ate and talked and laughed the cowboys were packing horses and burros and throwing
the diamond-hitch, a procedure so interesting to Castleton that he got up with coffee-cup in
hand and tramped from one place to another.

"Heard of that diamond-hitch-up," he observed to a cowboy. "Bally nice little job!"

As soon as the pack-train was in readiness Stewart started it off in the lead to break trail.
A heavy growth of shrub interspersed with rock and cactus covered the slopes; and now all the
trail appeared to be uphill. It was not a question of comfort for Madeline and her party, for
comfort was impossible; it was a matter of making the travel possible for him. Florence wore
corduroy breeches and high-top boots, and the advantage of this masculine garb was at once
in evidence. The riding-habits of the other ladies suffered considerably from the sharp spikes.
It took all Madeline's watchfulness to save her horse's legs, to pick the best bits of open
ground, to make cut-offs from the trail, and to protect herself from outreaching thorny branches,
so that the time sped by without her knowing it. The pack-train forged ahead, and the trailing
couples grew farther apart. At noon they got out of the foothills to face the real ascent of
the mountains. The sun beat down hot. There was little breeze, and the dust rose thick and
hung in a pall. The view was restricted, and what scenery lay open to the eye was dreary and
drab, a barren monotony of slow-mounting slopes ridged by rocky canyons.

Once Stewart waited for Madeline, and as she came up he said:

"We're going to have a storm."

"That will be a relief. It's so hot and dusty," replied Madeline.

"Shall I call a halt and make camp?"

"Here? Oh no! What do you think best?"

"Well, if we have a good healthy thunder-storm it will be something new for your friends. I
think we'd be wise to keep on the go. There's no place to make a good camp. The wind would
blow us off this slope if the rain didn't wash us off. It'll take all-day travel to reach a
good camp-site, and I don't promise that. We're making slow time. If it rains, let it rain.
The pack outfit is well covered. We will have to get wet."

"Surely," replied Madeline; and she smiled at his inference. She knew what a storm was in that
country, and her guests had yet to experience one. "If it rains, let it rain."

Stewart rode on, and Madeline followed. Up the slope toiled and nodded the pack-animals, the
little burros going easily where the horses labored. Their packs, like the humps of camels,
bobbed from side to side. Stones rattled down; the heat-waves wavered black; the dust puffed
up and sailed. The sky was a pale blue, like heated steel, except where dark clouds peeped
over the mountain crests. A heavy, sultry atmosphere made breathing difficult. Down the slope
the trailing party stretched out in twos and threes, and it was easy to distinguish the weary
riders.

Half a mile farther up Madeline could see over the foothills to the north and west and a little
south, and she forgot the heat and weariness and discomfort for her guests in wide, unlimited
prospects of sun-scorched earth. She marked the gray valley and the black mountains and the
wide, red gateway of the desert, and the dim, shadowy peaks, blue as the sky they pierced.
She was sorry when the bleak, gnarled cedar-trees shut off her view.

Then there came a respite from the steep climb, and the way led in a winding course through
a matted, storm-wrenched forest of stunted trees. Even up to this elevation the desert reached
with its gaunt hand. The clouds overspreading the sky, hiding the sun, made a welcome change.
The pack-train rested, and Stewart and Madeline waited for the party to come up. Here he briefly
explained to her that Don Carlos and his bandits had left the ranch some time in the night.
Thunder rumbled in the distance, and a faint wind rustled the scant foliage of the cedars.
The air grew oppressive; the horses panted.

"Sure it'll be a hummer," said Stewart. "The first storm almost always is bad. I can feel it
in the air."

The air, indeed, seemed to be charged with a heavy force that was waiting to be liberated.

One by one the couples mounted to the cedar forest, and the feminine contingent declaimed eloquently
for rest. But there was to be no permanent rest until night and then that depended upon reaching
the crags. The pack-train wagged onward, and Stewart fell in behind. The storm-center gathered
slowly around the peaks; low rumble and howl of thunder increased in frequence; slowly the
light shaded as smoky clouds rolled up; the air grew sultrier, and the exasperating breeze
puffed a few times and then failed.

An hour later the party had climbed high and was rounding the side of a great bare ridge that
long had hidden the crags. The last burro of the pack-train plodded over the ridge out of Madeline's
sight. She looked backward down the slope, amused to see her guests change wearily from side
to side in their saddles. Far below lay the cedar flat and the foothills. Far to the west the
sky was still clear, with shafts of sunlight shooting down from behind the encroaching clouds.

Stewart reached the summit of the ridge and, though only a few rods ahead, he waved to her,
sweeping his hand round to what he saw beyond. It was an impressive gesture, and Madeline,
never having climbed as high as this, anticipated much.

Majesty surmounted the last few steps and, snorting, halted beside Stewart's black. To Madeline
the scene was as if the world had changed. The ridge was a mountain-top. It dropped before
her into a black, stone-ridged, shrub-patched, many-canyoned gulf. Eastward, beyond the gulf,
round, bare mountain-heads loomed up. Upward, on the right, led giant steps of cliff and bench
and weathered slope to the fir-bordered and pine-fringed crags standing dark and bare against
the stormy sky. Massed inky clouds were piling across the peaks, obscuring the highest ones.
A fork of white lightning flashed, and, like the booming of an avalanche, thunder followed.

That bold world of broken rock under the slow mustering of storm-clouds was a grim, awe-inspiring
spectacle. It had beauty, but beauty of the sublime and majestic kind. The fierce desert had
reached up to meet the magnetic heights where heat and wind and frost and lightning and flood
contended in everlasting strife. And before their onslaught this mighty upflung world of rugged
stone was crumbling, splitting, wearing to ruin.

Madeline glanced at Stewart. He had forgotten her presence. Immovable as stone, he sat his
horse, dark-faced, dark-eyed, and, like an Indian unconscious of thought, he watched and watched.
To see him thus, to divine the strange affinity between the soul of this man, become primitive,
and the savage environment that had developed him, were powerful helps to Madeline Hammond
in her strange desire to understand his nature.

A cracking of iron-shod hoofs behind her broke the spell. Monty had reached the summit.

"Gene, what it won't all be doin' in a minnut Moses hisself couldn't tell," observed Monty.

Then Dorothy climbed to his side and looked.

"Oh, isn't it just perfectly lovely!" she exclaimed. "But I wish it wouldn't storm. We'll all
get wet."

Once more Stewart faced the ascent, keeping to the slow heave of the ridge as it rose southward
toward the looming spires of rock. Soon he was off smooth ground, and Madeline, some rods behind
him, looked back with concern at her friends. Here the real toil, the real climb began, and
a mountain storm was about to burst in all its fury.

The slope that Stewart entered upon was a magnificent monument to the ruined crags above. It
was a southerly slope, and therefore semi-arid, covered with cercocarpus and yucca and some
shrub that Madeline believed was manzanita. Every foot of the trail seemed to slide under Majesty.
What hard ground there was could not be traveled upon, owing to the spiny covering or masses
of shattered rocks. Gullies lined the slope.

Then the sky grew blacker; the slow-gathering clouds appeared to be suddenly agitated; they
piled and rolled and mushroomed and obscured the crags. The air moved heavily and seemed to
be laden with sulphurous smoke, and sharp lightning flashes began to play. A distant roar of
wind could be heard between the peals of thunder.

Stewart waited for Madeline under the lee of a shelving cliff, where the cowboys had halted
the pack-train. Majesty was sensitive to the flashes of lightning. Madeline patted his neck
and softly called to him. The weary burros nodded; the Mexican women covered their heads with
their mantles. Stewart untied the slicker at the back of Madeline's saddle and helped her on
with it. Then he put on his own. The other cowboys followed suit. Presently Madeline saw Monty
and Dorothy rounding the cliff, and hoped the others would come soon.

A blue-white, knotted rope of lightning burned down out of the clouds, and instantly a thunder-clap
crashed, seeming to shake the foundations of the earth. Then it rolled, as if banging from
cloud to cloud, and boomed along the peaks, and reverberated from deep to low, at last to rumble
away into silence. Madeline felt the electricity in Majesty's mane, and it seemed to tingle
through her nerves. The air had a weird, bright cast. The ponderous clouds swallowed more and
more of the eastern domes. This moment of the breaking of the storm, with the strange growing
roar of wind, like a moaning monster, was pregnant with a heart-disturbing emotion for Madeline
Hammond. Glorious it was to be free, healthy, out in the open, under the shadow of the mountain
and cloud, in the teeth of the wind and rain and storm.

Another dazzling blue blaze showed the bold mountain-side and the storm-driven clouds. In the
flare of light Madeline saw Stewart's face.

"Are you afraid?" she asked.

"Yes," he replied, simply.

Then the thunderbolt racked the heavens, and as it boomed away in lessening power Madeline
reflected with surprise upon Stewart's answer. Something in his face had made her ask him what
she considered a foolish question. His reply amazed her. She loved a storm. Why should he fear
it--he, with whom she could not associate fear?

"How strange! Have you not been out in many storms?"

A smile that was only a gleam flitted over his dark face.

"In hundreds of them. By day, with the cattle stampeding. At night, alone on the mountain,
with the pines crashing and the rocks rolling--in flood on the desert."

"It's not only the lightning, then?" she asked.

"No. All the storm."

Madeline felt that henceforth she would have less faith in what she had imagined was her love
of the elements. What little she knew! If this iron-nerved man feared a storm, then there was
something about a storm to fear.

And suddenly, as the ground quaked under her horse's feet, and all the sky grew black and crisscrossed
by flaming streaks, and between thunderous reports there was a strange hollow roar sweeping
down upon her, she realized how small was her knowledge and experience of the mighty forces
of nature. Then, with that perversity of character of which she was wholly conscious, she was
humble, submissive, reverent, and fearful even while she gloried in the grandeur of the dark,
cloud-shadowed crags and canyons, the stupendous strife of sound, the wonderful driving lances
of white fire.

With blacker gloom and deafening roar came the torrent of rain. It was a cloud-burst. It was
like solid water tumbling down. For long Madeline sat her horse, head bent to the pelting rain.
When its force lessened and she heard Stewart call for all to follow, she looked up to see
that he was starting once more. She shot a glimpse at Dorothy and as quickly glanced away.

"Warm clothes--hot drinks and grub--warm blankets," rang out Stewart's sharp order.

Then, with Florence helping the Mexican women, it was not long until Madeline and the feminine
side of the party were comfortable, except for the weariness and aches that only rest and sleep
could alleviate.

Neither fatigue nor pains, however, nor the strangeness of being packed sardine-like under
canvas, nor the howls of coyotes, kept Madeline's guests from stretching out with long, grateful
sighs, and one by one dropping into deep slumber. Madeline whispered a little to Florence,
and laughed with her once or twice, and then the light flickering on the canvas faded and her
eyelids closed. Darkness and roar of camp life, low voices of men, thump of horses' hoofs,
coyote serenade, the sense of warmth and sweet rest--all drifted away.

          *****

When she awakened shadows of swaying branches moved on the sunlit canvas above her. She heard
the ringing strokes of an ax, but no other sound from outside. Slow, regular breathing attested
to the deep slumbers of her tent comrades. She observed presently that Florence was missing
from the number. Madeline rose and peeped out between the flaps.

An exquisitely beautiful scene surprised and enthralled her gaze. She saw a level space, green
with long grass, bright with flowers, dotted with groves of graceful firs and pines and spruces,
reaching to superb crags, rosy and golden in the sunlight. Eager to get out where she could
enjoy an unrestricted view, she searched for her pack, found it in a corner, and then hurriedly
and quietly dressed.

Her favorite stag-hounds, Russ and Tartar, were asleep before the door, where they had been
chained. She awakened them and loosened them, thinking the while that it must have been Stewart
who had chained them near her. Close at hand also was a cowboy's bed rolled up in a tarpaulin.

The cool air, fragrant with pine and spruce and some subtle nameless tang, sweet and tonic,
made Madeline stand erect and breathe slowly and deeply. It was like drinking of a magic draught.
She felt it in her blood, that it quickened its flow. Turning to look in the other direction,
beyond the tent, she saw the remnants of last night's temporary camp, and farther on a grove
of beautiful pines from which came the sharp ring of the ax. Wider gaze took in a wonderful
park, not only surrounded by lofty crags, but full of crags of lesser height, many lifting
their heads from dark-green groves of trees. The morning sun, not yet above the eastern elevations,
sent its rosy and golden shafts in between the towering rocks, to tip the pines.

Madeline, with the hounds beside her, walked through the nearest grove. The ground was soft
and springy and brown with pine-needles. Then she saw that a clump of trees had prevented her
from seeing the most striking part of this natural park. The cowboys had selected a campsite
where they would have the morning sun and afternoon shade. Several tents and flies were already
up; there was a huge lean-to made of spruce boughs; cowboys were busy round several camp-fires;
piles of packs lay covered with tarpaulins, and beds were rolled up under the trees. This space
was a kind of rolling meadow, with isolated trees here and there, and other trees in aisles
and circles; and it mounted up in low, grassy banks to great towers of stone five hundred feet
high. Other crags rose behind these. From under a mossy cliff, huge and green and cool, bubbled
a full, clear spring. Wild flowers fringed its banks. Out in the meadow the horses were knee-deep
in grass that waved in the morning breeze.

Florence espied Madeline under the trees and came running. She was like a young girl, with
life and color and joy. She wore a flannel blouse, corduroy skirt, and moccasins. And her hair
was fastened under a band like an Indian's.

"Castleton's gone with a gun, for hours, it seems," said Florence. "Gene just went to hunt
him up. The other gentlemen are still asleep. I imagine they sure will sleep up heah in this air."

Then, business-like, Florence fell to questioning Madeline about details of camp arrangement
which Stewart, and Florence herself, could hardly see to without suggestion.

Before any of Madeline's sleepy guests awakened the camp was completed. Madeline and Florence
had a tent under a pine-tree, but they did not intend to sleep in it except during stormy weather.
They spread a tarpaulin, made their bed on it, and elected to sleep under the light of the
stars. After that, taking the hounds with them, they explored. To Madeline's surprise, the
park was not a little half-mile nook nestling among the crags, but extended farther than they
cared to walk, and was rather a series of parks. They were no more than small valleys between
gray-toothed peaks. As the day advanced the charm of the place grew upon Madeline. Even at
noon, with the sun beating down, there was comfortable warmth rather than heat. It was the
kind of warmth that Madeline liked to feel in the spring. And the sweet, thin, rare atmosphere
began to affect her strangely. She breathed deeply of it until she felt light-headed, as if
her body lacked substance and might drift away like a thistledown. All at once she grew uncomfortably
sleepy. A dreamy languor possessed her, and, lying under a pine with her head against Florence,
she went to sleep. When she opened her eyes the shadows of the crags stretched from the west,
and between them streamed a red-gold light. It was hazy, smoky sunshine losing its fire. The
afternoon had far advanced. Madeline sat up. Florence was lazily reading. The two Mexican women
were at work under the fly where the big stone fireplace had been erected. No one else was
in sight.

Florence, upon being questioned, informed Madeline that incident about camp had been delightfully
absent. Castleton had returned and was profoundly sleeping with the other men. Presently a
chorus of merry calls attracted Madeline's attention, and she turned to see Helen limping along
with Dorothy, and Mrs. Beck and Edith supporting each other. They were all rested, but lame,
and delighted with the place, and as hungry as bears awakened from a winter's sleep. Madeline
forthwith escorted them round the camp, and through the many aisles between the trees, and
to the mossy, pine-matted nooks under the crags.

Then they had dinner, sitting on the ground after the manner of Indians; and it was a dinner
that lacked merriment only because everybody was too busily appeasing appetite.

Later Stewart led them across a neck of the park, up a rather steep climb between towering
crags, to take them out upon a grassy promontory that faced the great open west--a vast, ridged,
streaked, and reddened sweep of earth rolling down, as it seemed, to the golden sunset end
of the world. Castleton said it was a jolly fine view; Dorothy voiced her usual languid enthusiasm;
Helen was on fire with pleasure and wonder; Mrs. Beck appealed to Bobby to see how he liked
it before she ventured, and she then reiterated his praise; and Edith Wayne, like Madeline
and Florence, was silent. Boyd was politely interested; he was the kind of man who appeared
to care for things as other people cared for them.

Madeline watched the slow transformation of the changing west, with its haze of desert dust,
through which mountain and cloud and sun slowly darkened. She watched until her eyes ached,
and scarcely had a thought of what she was watching. When her eyes shifted to encounter the
tall form of Stewart standing motionless on the rim, her mind became active again. As usual,
he stood apart from the others, and now he seemed aloof and unconscious. He made a dark, powerful
figure, and he fitted that wild promontory.

She experienced a strange, annoying surprise when she discovered both Helen and Dorothy watching
Stewart with peculiar interest. Edith, too, was alive to the splendid picture the cowboy made.
But when Edith smiled and whispered in her ear, "It's so good to look at a man like that,"
Madeline again felt the surprise, only this time the accompaniment was a vague pleasure rather
than annoyance. Helen and Dorothy were flirts, one deliberate and skilled, the other unconscious
and natural. Edith Wayne, occasionally--and Madeline reflected that the occasions were infrequent--admired
a man sincerely. Just here Madeline might have fallen into a somewhat revealing state of mind
if it had not been for the fact that she believed Stewart was only an object of deep interest
to her, not as a man, but as a part of this wild and wonderful West which was claiming her.
So she did not inquire of herself why Helen's coquetry and Dorothy's languishing allurement
annoyed her, or why Edith's eloquent smile and words had pleased her. She got as far, however,
as to think scornfully how Helen and Dorothy would welcome and meet a flirtation with this
cowboy and then go back home and forget him as utterly as if he had never existed. She wondered,
too, with a curious twist of feeling that was almost eagerness, how the cowboy would meet their
advances. Obviously the situation was unfair to him; and if by some strange accident he escaped
unscathed by Dorothy's beautiful eyes he would never be able to withstand Helen's subtle and
fascinating and imperious personality.

They returned to camp in the cool of the evening and made merry round a blazing camp-fire.
But Madeline's guests soon succumbed to the persistent and irresistible desire to sleep.

Then Madeline went to bed with Florence under the pine-tree. Russ lay upon one side and Tartar
upon the other. The cool night breeze swept over her, fanning her face, waving her hair. It
was not strong enough to make any sound through the branches, but it stirred a faint, silken
rustle in the long grass. The coyotes began their weird bark and howl. Russ raised his head
to growl at their impudence.

Madeline faced upward, and it seemed to her that under those wonderful white stars she would
never be able to go to sleep. They blinked down through the black-barred, delicate crisscross
of pine foliage, and they looked so big and so close. Then she gazed away to open space, where
an expanse of sky glittered with stars, and the longer she gazed the larger they grew and the
more she saw.

It was her belief that she had come to love all the physical things from which sensations of
beauty and mystery and strength poured into her responsive mind; but best of all she loved
these Western stars, for they were to have something to do with her life, were somehow to influence
her destiny.

          *****

For a few days the prevailing features of camp life for Madeline's guests were sleep and rest.
Dorothy Coombs slept through twenty-four hours, and then was so difficult to awaken that for
a while her friends were alarmed. Helen almost fell asleep while eating and talking. The men
were more visibly affected by the mountain air than the women. Castleton, however, would not
succumb to the strange drowsiness while he had a chance to prowl around with a gun.

This languorous spell disappeared presently, and then the days were full of life and action.
Mrs. Beck and Bobby and Boyd, however, did not go in for anything very strenuous. Edith Wayne,
too, preferred to walk through the groves or sit upon the grassy promontory. It was Helen and
Dorothy who wanted to explore the crags and canyons, and when they could not get the others
to accompany them they went alone, giving the cowboy guides many a long climb.

Necessarily, of course, Madeline and her guests were now thrown much in company with the cowboys.
And the party grew to be like one big family. Her friends not only adapted themselves admirably
to the situation, but came to revel in it. As for Madeline, she saw that outside of a certain
proclivity of the cowboys to be gallant and on dress-parade and alive to possibilities of fun
and excitement, they were not greatly different from what they were at all times. If there
were a leveling process here it was made by her friends coming down to meet the Westerners.
Besides, any class of people would tend to grow natural in such circumstances and environment.

Madeline found the situation one of keen and double interest for her. If before she had cared
to study her cowboys, particularly Stewart, now, with the contrasts afforded by her guests,
she felt by turns she was amused and mystified and perplexed and saddened, and then again subtly
pleased.

Monty, once he had overcome his shyness, became a source of delight to Madeline, and, for that
matter, to everybody. Monty had suddenly discovered that he was a success among the ladies.
Either he was exalted to heroic heights by this knowledge or he made it appear so. Dorothy
had been his undoing, and in justice to her Madeline believed her innocent. Dorothy thought
Monty hideous to look at, and, accordingly, if he had been a hero a hundred times and had saved
a hundred poor little babies' lives, he could not have interested her. Monty followed her around,
reminding her, she told Madeline, of a little adoring dog one moment and the next of a huge,
devouring gorilla.

Nels and Nick stalked at Helen's heels like grenadiers on duty, and if she as much as dropped
her glove they almost came to blows to see who should pick it up.

In a way Castleton was the best feature of the camping party. He was such an absurd-looking
little man, and his abilities were at such tremendous odds with what might have been expected
of him from his looks. He could ride, tramp, climb, shoot. He liked to help around the camp,
and the cowboys could not keep him from it. He had an insatiable desire to do things that were
new to him. The cowboys played innumerable tricks upon him, not one of which he ever discovered.
He was serious, slow in speech and action, and absolutely imperturbable. If imperturbability
could ever be good humor, then he was always good-humored. Presently the cowboys began to understand
him, and then to like him. When they liked a man it meant something. Madeline had been sorry
more than once to see how little the cowboys chose to speak to Boyd Harvey. With Castleton,
however, they actually became friends. They did not know it, and certainly such a thing never
occurred to him; all the same, it was a fact. And it grew solely out of the truth that the
Englishman was manly in the only way cowboys could have interpreted manliness. When, after
innumerable attempts, he succeeded in throwing the diamond-hitch on a pack-horse the cowboys
began to respect him. Castleton needed only one more accomplishment to claim their hearts,
and he kept trying that--to ride a bucking bronco. One of the cowboys had a bronco that they
called Devil. Every day for a week Devil threw the Englishman all over the park, ruined his
clothes, bruised him, and finally kicked him. Then the cowboys solicitously tried to make Castleton
give up; and this was remarkable enough, for the spectacle of an English lord on a bucking
bronco was one that any Westerner would have ridden a thousand miles to see. Whenever Devil
threw Castleton the cowboys went into spasms. But Castleton did not know the meaning of the
word fail, and there came a day when Devil could not throw him. Then it was a singular sight
to see the men line up to shake hands with the cool Englishman. Even Stewart, who had watched
from the background, came forward with a warm and pleasant smile on his dark face. When Castleton
went to his tent there was much characteristic cowboy talk, and this time vastly different
from the former persiflage.

"By Gawd!" ejaculated Monty Price, who seemed to be the most amazed and elated of them all.
"Thet's the fust Englishman I ever seen! He's orful deceivin' to look at, but I know now why
England rules the wurrld. Jest take a peek at thet bronco. His spirit is broke. Rid by a leetle
English dook no bigger 'n a grasshopper! Fellers, if it hain't dawned on you yit, let Monty
Price give you a hunch. There's no flies on Castleton. An' I'll bet a million steers to a rawhide
rope thet next he'll be throwin' a gun as good as Nels."

It was a distinct pleasure for Madeline to realize that she liked Castleton all the better
for the traits brought out so forcibly by his association with the cowboys. On the other hand,
she liked the cowboys better for something in them that contact with Easterners brought out.
This was especially true in Stewart's case. She had been wholly wrong when she had imagined
he would fall an easy victim to Dorothy's eyes and Helen's lures. He was kind, helpful, courteous,
and watchful. But he had no sentiment. He did not see Dorothy's charms or feel Helen's fascination.
And their efforts to captivate him were now so obvious that Mrs. Beck taunted them, and Edith
smiled knowingly, and Bobby and Boyd made playful remarks. All of which cut Helen's pride and
hurt Dorothy's vanity. They essayed open conquest of Stewart.

So it came about that Madeline unconsciously admitted the cowboy to a place in her mind never
occupied by any other. The instant it occurred to her why he was proof against the wiles of
the other women she drove that amazing and strangely disturbing thought from her. Nevertheless,
as she was human, she could not help thinking and being pleased and enjoying a little the discomfiture
of the two coquettes.

Moreover, from this thought of Stewart, and the watchfulness growing out of it she discovered
more about him. He was not happy; he often paced up and down the grove at night; he absented
himself from camp sometimes during the afternoon when Nels and Nick and Monty were there; he
was always watching the trails, as if he expected to see some one come riding up. He alone
of the cowboys did not indulge in the fun and talk around the camp-fire. He remained preoccupied
and sad, and was always looking away into distance. Madeline had a strange sense of his guardianship
over her; and, remembering Don Carlos, she imagined he worried a good deal over his charge,
and, indeed, over the safety of all the party.

But if he did worry about possible visits from wandering guerrillas, why did he absent himself
from camp? Suddenly into Madeline's inquisitive mind flashed a remembrance of the dark-eyed
Mexican girl, Bonita, who had never been heard of since that night she rode Stewart's big horse
out of El Cajon. The remembrance of her brought an idea. Perhaps Stewart had a rendezvous in
the mountains, and these lonely trips of his were to meet Bonita. With the idea hot blood flamed
into Madeline's cheek. Then she was amazed at her own feelings--amazed because her swiftest
succeeding thought was to deny the idea--amazed that its conception had fired her cheek with
shame. Then her old self, the one aloof from this red-blooded new self, gained control over
her emotions.

But Madeline found that new-born self a creature of strange power to return and govern at any
moment. She found it fighting loyally for what intelligence and wisdom told her was only her
romantic conception of a cowboy. She reasoned: If Stewart were the kind of man her feminine
skepticism wanted to make him, he would not have been so blind to the coquettish advances of
Helen and Dorothy. He had once been--she did not want to recall what he had once been. But
he had been uplifted. Madeline Hammond declared that. She was swayed by a strong, beating pride,
and her instinctive woman's faith told her that he could not stoop to such dishonor. She reproached
herself for having momentarily thought of it.

          *****

One afternoon a huge storm-cloud swooped out of the sky and enveloped the crags. It obscured
the westering sun and laid a mantle of darkness over the park. Madeline was uneasy because
several of her party, including Helen and Dorothy, had ridden off with the cowboys that afternoon
and had not returned. Florence assured her that even if they did not get back before the storm
broke there was no reason for apprehension. Nevertheless, Madeline sent for Stewart and asked
him to go or send some one in search of them.

Perhaps half an hour later Madeline heard the welcome pattering of hoofs on the trail. The
big tent was brightly lighted by several lanterns. Edith and Florence were with her. It was
so black outside that Madeline could not see a rod before her face. The wind was moaning in
the trees, and big drops of rain were pelting upon the canvas.

Presently, just outside the door, the horses halted, and there was a sharp bustle of sound,
such as would naturally result from a hurried dismounting and confusion in the dark. Mrs. Beck
came running into the tent out of breath and radiant because they had beaten the storm. Helen
entered next, and a little later came Dorothy, but long enough to make her entrance more noticeable.
The instant Madeline saw Dorothy's blazing eyes she knew something unusual had happened. Whatever
it was might have escaped comment had not Helen caught sight of Dorothy.

"Heavens, Dot, but you're handsome occasionally!" remarked Helen. "When you get some life in
your face and eyes!"

Dorothy turned her face away from the others, and perhaps it was only accident that she looked
into a mirror hanging on the tent wall. Swiftly she put her hand up to feel a wide red welt
on her cheek. Dorothy had been assiduously careful of her soft, white skin, and here was an
ugly mark marring its beauty.

"Look at that!" she cried, in distress. "My complexion's ruined!"

"How did you get such a splotch?" inquired Helen, going closer.

"I've been kissed!" exclaimed Dorothy, dramatically.

"What?" queried Helen, more curiously, while the others laughed.

"I've been kissed--hugged and kissed by one of those shameless cowboys! It was so pitch-dark
outside I couldn't see a thing. And so noisy I couldn't hear. But somebody was trying to help
me off my horse. My foot caught in the stirrup, and away I went--right into somebody's arms.
Then he did it, the wretch! He hugged and kissed me in a most awful bearish manner. I couldn't
budge a finger. I'm simply boiling with rage!"

When the outburst of mirth subsided Dorothy turned her big, dilated eyes upon Florence.

"Do these cowboys really take advantage of a girl when she's helpless and in the dark?"

"Of course they do," replied Florence, with her frank smile.

"Dot, what in the world could you expect?" asked Helen. "Haven't you been dying to be kissed?"

"No."

"Well, you acted like it, then. I never before saw you in a rage over being kissed."

"I--I wouldn't care so much if the brute hadn't scoured the skin off my face. He had whiskers
as sharp and stiff as sandpaper. And when I jerked away he rubbed my cheek with them."

This revelation as to the cause of her outraged dignity almost prostrated her friends with glee.

"Dot, I agree with you; it's one thing to be kissed, and quite another to have your beauty
spoiled," replied Helen, presently. "Who was this particular savage?"

"I don't know!" burst out Dorothy. "If I did I'd--I'd--"

Her eyes expressed the direful punishment she could not speak.

"Honestly now, Dot, haven't you the least idea who did it?" questioned Helen.

"I hope--I think it was Stewart," replied Dorothy.

"Ah! Dot, your hope is father to the thought. My dear, I'm sorry to riddle your little romance.
Stewart did not--could not have been the offender or hero."

"How do you know he couldn't?" demanded Dorothy, flushing.

"Because he was clean-shaven to-day at noon, before we rode out. I remember perfectly how nice
and smooth and brown his face looked."

"Oh, do you? Well, if your memory for faces is so good, maybe you can tell me which one of
these cowboys wasn't clean-shaven."

"Merely a matter of elimination," replied Helen, merrily. "It was not Nick; it was not Nels;
it was not Frankie. There was only one other cowboy with us, and he had a short, stubby growth
of black beard, much like that cactus we passed on the trail."

"Oh, I was afraid of it," moaned Dorothy. "I knew he was going to do it. That horrible little
smiling demon, Monty Price!"

          *****

A favorite lounging-spot of Madeline's was a shaded niche under the lee of crags facing the
east. Here the outlook was entirely different from that on the western side. It was not red
and white and glaring, nor so changeable that it taxed attention. This eastern view was one
of the mountains and valleys, where, to be sure, there were arid patches; but the restful green
of pine and fir was there, and the cool gray of crags. Bold and rugged indeed were these mountain
features, yet they were companionably close, not immeasurably distant and unattainable like
the desert. Here in the shade of afternoon Madeline and Edith would often lounge under a low-branched
tree. Seldom they talked much, for it was afternoon and dreamy with the strange spell of this
mountain fastness. There was smoky haze in the valleys, a fleecy cloud resting over the peaks,
a sailing eagle in the blue sky, silence that was the unbroken silence of the wild heights,
and a soft wind laden with incense of pine.

One afternoon, however, Edith appeared prone to talk seriously.

"Majesty, I must go home soon. I cannot stay out here forever. Are you going back with me?"

"Well, maybe," replied Madeline, thoughtfully. "I have considered it. I shall have to visit
home some time. But this summer mother and father are going to Europe."

"See here, Majesty Hammond, do you intend to spend the rest of your life in this wilderness?"
asked Edith, bluntly.

Madeline was silent.

"Oh, it is glorious! Don't misunderstand me, dear," went on Edith, earnestly, as she laid her
hand on Madeline's. "This trip has been a revelation to me. I did not tell you, Majesty, that
I was ill when I arrived. Now I'm well. So well! Look at Helen, too. Why, she was a ghost when
we got here. Now she is brown and strong and beautiful. If it were for nothing else than this
wonderful gift of health I would love the West. But I have come to love it for other things--even
spiritual things. Majesty, I have been studying you. I see and feel what this life has made
of you. When I came I wondered at your strength, your virility, your serenity, your happiness.
And I was stunned. I wondered at the causes of your change. Now I know. You were sick of idleness,
sick of uselessness, if not of society--sick of the horrible noises and smells and contacts
one can no longer escape in the cities. I am sick of all that, too, and I could tell you many
women of our kind who suffer in a like manner. You have done what many of us want to do, but
have not the courage. You have left it. I am not blind to the splendid difference you have
made in your life. I think I would have discovered, even if your brother had not told me, what
good you have done to the Mexicans and cattlemen of your range. Then you have work to do. That
is much the secret of your happiness, is it not? Tell me. Tell me something of what it means
to you?"

"Work, of course, has much to do with any one's happiness," replied Madeline. "No one can be
happy who has no work. As regards myself--for the rest I can hardly tell you. I have never
tried to put it in words. Frankly, I believe, if I had not had money that I could not have
found such contentment here. That is not in any sense a judgment against the West. But if I
had been poor I could not have bought and maintained my ranch. Stillwell tells me there are
many larger ranches than mine, but none just like it. Then I am almost paying my expenses out
of my business. Think of that! My income, instead of being wasted, is mostly saved. I think--I
hope I am useful. I have been of some little good to the Mexicans--eased the hardships of a
few cowboys. For the rest, I think my life is a kind of dream. Of course my ranch and range
are real, my cowboys are typical. If I were to tell you how I feel about them it would simply
be a story of how Madeline Hammond sees the West. They are true to the West. It is I who am
strange, and what I feel for them may be strange, too. Edith, hold to your own impressions."

"But, Majesty, my impressions have changed. At first I did not like the wind, the dust, the
sun, the endless open stretches. But now I do like them. Where once I saw only terrible wastes
of barren ground now I see beauty and something noble. Then, at first, your cowboys struck
me as dirty, rough, loud, crude, savage--all that was primitive. I did not want them near me.
I imagined them callous, hard men, their only joy a carouse with their kind. But I was wrong.
I have changed. The dirt was only dust, and this desert dust is clean. They are still rough,
loud, crude, and savage in my eyes, but with a difference. They are natural men. They are little
children. Monty Price is one of nature's noblemen. The hard thing is to discover it. All his
hideous person, all his actions and speech, are masks of his real nature. Nels is a joy, a
simple, sweet, kindly, quiet man whom some woman should have loved. What would love have meant
to him! He told me that no woman ever loved him except his mother, and he lost her when he
was ten. Every man ought to be loved--especially such a man as Nels. Somehow his gun record
does not impress me. I never could believe he killed a man. Then take your foreman, Stewart.
He is a cowboy, his work and life the same as the others. But he has education and most of
the graces we are in the habit of saying make a gentleman. Stewart is a strange fellow, just
like this strange country. He's a man, Majesty, and I admire him. So, you see, my impressions
are developing with my stay out here."

"Edith, I am so glad you told me that," replied Madeline, warmly.

"I like the country, and I like the men," went on Edith. "One reason I want to go home soon
is because I am discontented enough at home now, without falling in love with the West. For,
of course, Majesty, I would. I could not live out here. And that brings me to my point. Admitting
all the beauty and charm and wholesomeness and good of this wonderful country, still it is
no place for you, Madeline Hammond. You have your position, your wealth, your name, your family.
You must marry. You must have children. You must not give up all that for a quixotic life in
a wilderness."

"I am convinced, Edith, that I shall live here all the rest of my life."

"Oh, Majesty! I hate to preach this way. But I promised your mother I would talk to you. And
the truth is I hate--I hate what I'm saying. I envy you your courage and wisdom. I know you
have refused to marry Boyd Harvey. I could see that in his face. I believe you will refuse
Castleton. Whom will you marry? What chance is there for a woman of your position to marry
out here? What in the world will become of you?"

"Quien sabe?" replied Madeline, with a smile that was almost sad.

          *****

Not so many hours after this conversation with Edith, Madeline sat with Boyd Harvey upon the
grassy promontory overlooking the west, and she listened once again to his suave courtship.

Suddenly she turned to him and said, "Boyd, if I married you would you be willing--glad to
spend the rest of your life here in the West?"

"Majesty!" he exclaimed. There was amaze in the voice usually so even and well modulated--amaze
in the handsome face usually so indifferent. Her question had startled him. She saw him look
down the iron-gray cliffs, over the barren slopes and cedared ridges, beyond the cactus-covered
foothills to the grim and ghastly desert. Just then, with its red veils of sunlit dust-clouds,
its illimitable waste of ruined and upheaved earth, it was a sinister spectacle.

"No," he replied, with a tinge of shame in his cheek. Madeline said no more, nor did he speak.
She was spared the pain of refusing him, and she imagined he would never ask her again. There
was both relief and regret in the conviction. Humiliated lovers seldom made good friends.

It was impossible not to like Boyd Harvey. The thought of that, and why she could not marry
him, concentrated her never-satisfied mind upon the man. She looked at him, and she thought of him.

He was handsome, young, rich, well born, pleasant, cultivated--he was all that made a gentleman
of his class. If he had any vices she had not heard of them. She knew he had no thirst for
drink or craze for gambling. He was considered a very desirable and eligible young man. Madeline
admitted all this.

Then she thought of things that were perhaps exclusively her own strange ideas. Boyd Harvey's
white skin did not tan even in this southwestern sun and wind. His hands were whiter than her
own, and as soft. They were really beautiful, and she remembered what care he took of them.
They were a proof that he never worked. His frame was tall, graceful, elegant. It did not bear
evidence of ruggedness. He had never indulged in a sport more strenuous than yachting. He hated
effort and activity. He rode horseback very little, disliked any but moderate motoring, spent
much time in Newport and Europe, never walked when he could help it, and had no ambition unless
it were to pass the days pleasantly. If he ever had any sons they would be like him, only a
generation more toward the inevitable extinction of his race.

Madeline returned to camp in just the mood to make a sharp, deciding contrast. It happened--fatefully,
perhaps--that the first man she saw was Stewart. He had just ridden into camp, and as she came
up he explained that he had gone down to the ranch for the important mail about which she had
expressed anxiety.

"Down and back in one day!" she exclaimed.

"Yes," he replied. "It wasn't so bad."

"But why did you not send one of the boys, and let him make the regular two-day trip?"

"You were worried about your mail," he answered, briefly, as he delivered it. Then he bent
to examine the fetlocks of his weary horse.

It was midsummer now, Madeline reflected and exceedingly hot and dusty on the lower trail.
Stewart had ridden down the mountain and back again in twelve hours. Probably no horse in the
outfit, except his big black or Majesty, could have stood that trip. And his horse showed the
effects of a grueling day. He was caked with dust and lame and weary.

Stewart looked as if he had spared the horse his weight on many a mile of that rough ascent.
His boots were evidence of it. His heavy flannel shirt, wet through with perspiration, adhered
closely to his shoulders and arms, so that every ripple of muscle plainly showed. His face
was black, except round the temples and forehead, where it was bright red. Drops of sweat,
running off his blackened hands dripped to the ground. He got up from examining the lame foot,
and then threw off the saddle. The black horse snorted and lunged for the watering-pool. Stewart
let him drink a little, then with iron arms dragged him away. In this action the man's lithe,
powerful form impressed Madeline with a wonderful sense of muscular force. His brawny wrist
was bare; his big, strong hand, first clutching the horse's mane, then patting his neck, had
a bruised knuckle, and one finger was bound up. That hand expressed as much gentleness and
thoughtfulness for the horse as it had strength to drag him back from too much drinking at
a dangerous moment.

Stewart was a combination of fire, strength, and action. These attributes seemed to cling about
him. There was something vital and compelling in his presence. Worn and spent and drawn as
he was from the long ride, he thrilled Madeline with his potential youth and unused vitality
and promise of things to be, red-blooded deeds, both of flesh and spirit. In him she saw the
strength of his forefathers unimpaired. The life in him was marvelously significant. The dust,
the dirt, the sweat, the soiled clothes, the bruised and bandaged hand, the brawn and bone--these
had not been despised by the knights of ancient days, nor by modern women whose eyes shed soft
light upon coarse and bloody toilers.

Madeline Hammond compared the man of the East with the man of the West; and that comparison
was the last parting regret for her old standards.

XVII. The Lost Mine of the Padres

In the cool, starry evenings the campers sat around a blazing fire and told and listened to
stories thrillingly fitted to the dark crags and the wild solitude.

Monty Price had come to shine brilliantly as a storyteller. He was an atrocious liar, but this
fact would not have been evident to his enthralled listeners if his cowboy comrades, in base
jealousy, had not betrayed him. The truth about his remarkable fabrications, however, had not
become known to Castleton, solely because of the Englishman's obtuseness. And there was another
thing much stranger than this and quite as amusing. Hammer is wide, face. If i had been delight

 Dust of gold! Grains of gold! Pebbles of gold!
Rocks of gold! He was rich beyond all dreams. He remembered the Virgin and her words. He must
return to his people and build their church, and the great city that would bear his name.

"But Juan tarried. Always he was going manana. He loved the dark-eyed Apache girl so well that
he could not leave her. He hated himself for his infidelity to his Virgin, to his people. He
was weak and false, a sinner. But he could not go, and he gave himself up to love of the Indian
maiden.

"The old Apache chief discovered the secret love of his daughter and the padre. And, fierce
in his anger, he took her up into the mountains and burned her alive and cast her ashes upon
the wind. He did not kill Padre Juan. He was too wise, and perhaps too cruel, for he saw the
strength of Juan's love. Besides, many of his tribe had learned much from the Spaniard.

"Padre Juan fell into despair. He had no desire to live. He faded and wasted away. But before
he died he went to the old Indians who had burned the maiden, and he begged them, when he was
dead, to burn his body and to cast his ashes to the wind from that wonderful slope, where they
would blow away to mingle forever with those of his Indian sweetheart.

"The Indians promised, and when Padre Juan died they burned his body and took his ashes to
the mountain heights and cast them to the wind, where they drifted and fell to mix with the
ashes of the Indian girl he had loved.

"Years passed. More padres traveled across the desert to the home of the Apaches, and they
heard the story of Juan. Among their number was a padre who in his youth had been one of Juan's
people. He set forth to find Juan's grave, where he believed he would also find the gold. And
he came back with pebbles of gold and flowers that shed a golden dust, and he told a wonderful
story. He had climbed and climbed into the mountains, and he had come to a wonderful slope
under the crags. That slope was yellow with golden flowers. When he touched them golden ashes
drifted from them and blew down among the rocks.

"Then all the padres went into the mountains. But the discoverer of the mine lost his way.
They searched and searched until they were old and gray, but never found the wonderful slope
and flowers that marked the grave and the mine of Padre Juan.

"In the succeeding years the story was handed down from father to son. But of the many who
hunted for the lost mine of the padres there was never a Mexican or an Apache. For the Apache
the mountain slopes were haunted by the spirit of an Indian maiden who had been false to her
tribe and forever accursed. For the Mexican the mountain slopes were haunted by the spirit
of the false padre who rolled stones upon the heads of those adventurers who sought to find
his grave and his accursed gold."

XVIII. Bonita

Florence's story of the lost mine fired Madeline's guests with the fever for gold-hunting.
But after they had tried it a few times and the glamour of the thing wore off they gave up
and remained in camp. Having exhausted all the resources of the mountain, such that had interest
for them, they settled quietly down for a rest, which Madeline knew would soon end in a desire
for civilized comforts. They were almost tired of roughing it. Helen's discontent manifested
itself in her remark, "I guess nothing is going to happen, after all."

Madeline awaited their pleasure in regard to the breaking of camp; and meanwhile, as none of
them cared for more exertion, she took her walks without them, sometimes accompanied by one
of the cowboys, always by the stag-hounds. These walks furnished her exceeding pleasure. And,
now that the cowboys would talk to her without reserve, she grew fonder of listening to their
simple stories. The more she knew of them the more she doubted the wisdom of shut-in lives.
Companionship with Nels and most of the cowboys was in its effect like that of the rugged pines
and crags and the untainted wind. Humor, their predominant trait when a person grew to know
them, saved Madeline from finding their hardness trying. They were dreamers, as all men who
lived lonely lives in the wilds were dreamers.

The cowboys all had secrets. Madeline learned some of them. She marveled most at the strange
way in which they hid emotions, except of violence of mirth and temper so easily aroused. It
was all the more remarkable in view of the fact that they felt intensely over little things
to which men of the world were blind and dead. Madeline had to believe that a hard and perilous
life in a barren and wild country developed great principles in men. Living close to earth,
under the cold, bleak peaks, on the dust-veiled desert, men grew like the nature that developed
them--hard, fierce, terrible, perhaps, but big--big with elemental force.

But one day, while out walking alone, before she realized it she had gone a long way down a
dim trail winding among the rocks. It was the middle of a summer afternoon, and all about her
were shadows of the crags crossing the sunlit patches. The quiet was undisturbed. She went
on and on, not blind to the fact that she was perhaps going too far from camp, but risking
it because she was sure of her way back, and enjoying the wild, craggy recesses that were new
to her. Finally she came out upon a bank that broke abruptly into a beautiful little glade.
Here she sat down to rest before undertaking the return trip.

Suddenly Russ, the keener of the stag-hounds, raised his head and growled. Madeline feared
he might have scented a mountain-lion or wildcat. She quieted him and carefully looked around.
To each side was an irregular line of massive blocks of stone that had weathered from the crags.
The little glade was open and grassy, with here a pine-tree, there a boulder. The outlet seemed
to go down into a wilderness of canyons and ridges. Looking in this direction, Madeline saw
the slight, dark figure of a woman coming stealthily along under the pines. Madeline was amazed,
then a little frightened, for that stealthy walk from tree to tree was suggestive of secrecy,
if nothing worse.

Presently the woman was joined by a tall man who carried a package, which he gave to her. They
came on up the glade and appeared to be talking earnestly. In another moment Madeline recognized
Stewart. She had no greater feeling of surprise than had at first been hers. But for the next
moment she scarcely thought at all--merely watched the couple approaching. In a flash came
back her former curiosity as to Stewart's strange absences from camp, and then with the return
of her doubt of him the recognition of the woman. The small, dark head, the brown face, the
big eyes--Madeline now saw distinctly--belonged to the Mexican girl Bonita. Stewart had met
her there. This was the secret of his lonely trips, taken ever since he had come to work for
Madeline. This secluded glade was a rendezvous. He had her hidden there.

Quietly Madeline arose, with a gesture to the dogs, and went back along the trail toward camp.
Succeeding her surprise was a feeling of sorrow that Stewart's regeneration had not been complete.
Sorrow gave place to insufferable distrust that while she had been romancing about this cowboy,
dreaming of her good influence over him, he had been merely base. Somehow it stung her. Stewart
had been nothing to her, she thought, yet she had been proud of him. She tried to revolve the
thing, to be fair to him, when every instinctive tendency was to expel him, and all pertaining
to him, from her thoughts. And her effort at sympathy, at extenuation, failed utterly before
her pride. Exerting her will-power, she dismissed Stewart from her mind.

Madeline did not think of him again till late that afternoon, when, as she was leaving her
tent to join several of her guests, Stewart appeared suddenly in her path.

"Miss Hammond, I saw your tracks down the trail," he began, eagerly, but his tone was easy
and natural. "I'm thinking--well, maybe you sure got the idea--"

"I do not wish for an explanation," interrupted Madeline.

Stewart gave a slight start. His manner had a semblance of the old, cool audacity. As he looked
down at her it subtly changed.

What effrontery, Madeline thought, to face her before her guests with an explanation of his
conduct! Suddenly she felt an inward flash of fire that was pain, so strange, so incomprehensible,
that her mind whirled. Then anger possessed her, not at Stewart, but at herself, that anything
could rouse in her a raw emotion. She stood there, outwardly cold, serene, with level, haughty
eyes upon Stewart; but inwardly she was burning with rage and shame.

"I'm sure not going to have you think--" He began passionately, but he broke off, and a slow,
dull crimson blotted over the healthy red-brown of his neck and cheeks.

"What you do or think, Stewart, is no concern of mine."

"Miss--Miss Hammond! You don't believe--" faltered Stewart.

The crimson receded from his face, leaving it pale. His eyes were appealing. They had a kind
of timid look that struck Madeline even in her anger. There was something boyish about him
then. He took a step forward and reached out with his hand open-palmed in a gesture that was
humble, yet held a certain dignity.

"But listen. Never mind now what you--you think about me. There's a good reason--"

"I have no wish to hear your reason."

"But you ought to," he persisted.

"Sir!"

Stewart underwent another swift change. He started violently. A dark tide shaded his face and
a glitter leaped to his eyes. He took two long strides--loomed over her.

"I'm not thinking about myself," he thundered. "Will you listen?"

"No," she replied; and there was freezing hauteur in her voice. With a slight gesture of dismissal,
unmistakable in its finality, she turned her back upon him. Then she joined her guests.

Stewart stood perfectly motionless. Then slowly he began to lift his right hand in which he
held his sombrero. He swept it up and up high over his head. His tall form towered. With fierce
suddenness he flung his sombrero down. He leaped at his black horse and dragged him to where
his saddle lay. With one pitch he tossed the saddle upon the horse's back. His strong hands
flashed at girths and straps. Every action was swift, decisive, fierce. Bounding for his bridle,
which hung over a bush, he ran against a cowboy who awkwardly tried to avoid the onslaught.

"Get out of my way!" he yelled.

Then with the same savage haste he adjusted the bridle on his horse.

"Mebbe you better hold on a minnit, Gene, ole feller," said Monty Price.

"Monty, do you want me to brain you?" said Stewart, with the short, hard ring in his voice.

"Now, considerin' the high class of my brains, I oughter be real careful to keep 'em," replied
Monty. "You can betcher life, Gene, I ain't goin' to git in front of you. But I jest says--Listen!"

Stewart raised his dark face. Everybody listened. And everybody heard the rapid beat of a horse's
hoofs. The sun had set, but the park was light. Nels appeared down the trail, and his horse
was running. In another moment he was in the circle, pulling his bay back to a sliding halt.
He leaped off abreast of Stewart.

Madeline saw and felt a difference in Nels's presence.

"What's up, Gene?" he queried, sharply.

"I'm leaving camp," replied Stewart, thickly. His black horse began to stamp as Stewart grasped
bridle and mane and kicked the stirrup round.

Nels's long arm shot out, and his hand fell upon Stewart, holding him down.

"Shore I'm sorry," said Nels, slowly. "Then you was goin' to hit the trail?"

"I am going to. Let go, Nels."

"Shore you ain't goin', Gene?"

"Let go, damn you!" cried Stewart, as he wrestled free.

"What's wrong?" asked Nels, lifting his hand again.

"Man! Don't touch me!"

Nels stepped back instantly. He seemed to become aware of Stewart's white, wild passion. Again
Stewart moved to mount.

"Nels, don't make me forget we've been friends," he said.

"Shore I ain't fergettin'," replied Nels. "An' I resign my job right here an' now!"

His strange speech checked the mounting cowboy. Stewart stepped down from the stirrup. Then
their hard faces were still and cold while their eyes locked glances.

Madeline was as much startled by Nels's speech as Stewart. Quick to note a change in these
men, she now sensed one that was unfathomable.

"Resign?" questioned Stewart.

"Shore. What 'd you think I'd do under circumstances sich as has come up?"

"But see here, Nels, I won't stand for it."

"You're not my boss no more, an' I ain't beholdin' to Miss Hammond, neither. I'm my own boss,
an' I'll do as I please. Sabe, senor?"

Nels's words were at variance with the meaning in his face.

"Gene, you sent me on a little scout down in the mountains, didn't you?" he continued.

"Yes, I did," replied Stewart, with a new sharpness in his voice.

"Wal, shore you was so good an' right in your figgerin', as opposed to mine, that I'm sick
with admirin' of you. If you hedn't sent me--wal, I'm reckonin' somethin' might hev happened.
As it is we're shore up against a hell of a proposition!"

How significant was the effect of his words upon all the cowboys! Stewart made a fierce and
violent motion, terrible where his other motions had been but passionate. Monty leaped straight
up into the air in a singular action as suggestive of surprise as it was of wild acceptance
of menace. Like a stalking giant Nick Steele strode over to Nels and Stewart. The other cowboys
rose silently, without a word.

Madeline and her guests, in a little group, watched and listened, unable to divine what all
this strange talk and action meant.

"Hold on, Nels, they don't need to hear it," said Stewart, hoarsely, as he waved a hand toward
Madeline's silent group.

"Wal, I'm sorry, but I reckon they'd as well know fust as last. Mebbe thet yearnin' wish of
Miss Helen's fer somethin' to happen will come true. Shore I--"

"Cut out the joshin'," rang out Monty's strident voice.

It had as decided an effect as any preceding words or action. Perhaps it was the last thing
needed to transform these men, doing unaccustomed duty as escorts of beautiful women, to their
natural state as men of the wild.

"Tell us what's what," said Stewart, cool and grim.

"Don Carlos an' his guerrillas are campin' on the trails thet lead up here. They've got them
trails blocked. By to-morrer they'd hed us corralled. Mebbe they meant to surprise us. He's
got a lot of Greasers an' outlaws. They're well armed. Now what do they mean? You-all can figger
it out to suit yourselves. Mebbe the Don wants to pay a sociable call on our ladies. Mebbe
his gang is some hungry, as usual. Mebbe they want to steal a few hosses, or anythin' they
can lay hands on. Mebbe they mean wuss, too. Now my idee is this, an' mebbe it's wrong. I long
since separated from love with Greasers. Thet black-faced Don Carlos has got a deep game. Thet
two-bit of a revolution is hevin' hard times. The rebels want American intervention. They'd
stretch any point to make trouble. We're only ten miles from the border. Suppose them guerrillas
got our crowd across thet border? The U. S. cavalry would foller. You-all know what thet'd
mean. Mebbe Don Carlos's mind works thet way. Mebbe it don't. I reckon we'll know soon. An'
now, Stewart, whatever the Don's game is, shore you're the man to outfigger him. Mebbe it's
just as well you're good an' mad about somethin'. An' I resign my job because I want to feel
unbeholdin' to anybody. Shore it struck me long since thet the old days hed come back fer a
little spell, an' there I was trailin' a promise not to hurt any Greaser."

XIX. Don Carlos

Stewart took Nels, Monty, and Nick Steele aside out of earshot, and they evidently entered
upon an earnest colloquy. Presently the other cowboys were called. They all talked more or
less, but the deep voice of Stewart predominated over the others. Then the consultation broke
up, and the cowboys scattered.

"Rustle, you Indians!" ordered Stewart.

The ensuing scene of action was not reassuring to Madeline and her friends. They were quiet,
awaiting some one to tell them what to do. At the offset the cowboys appeared to have forgotten
Madeline. Some of them ran off into the woods, others into the open, grassy places, where they
rounded up the horses and burros. Several cowboys spread tarpaulins upon the ground and began
to select and roll small packs, evidently for hurried travel. Nels mounted his horse to ride
down the trail. Monty and Nick Steele went off into the grove, leading their horses. Stewart
climbed up a steep jumble of stone between two sections of low, cracked cliff back of the camp.

Castleton offered to help the packers, and was curtly told he would be in the way. Madeline's
friends all importuned her: Was there real danger? Were the guerrillas coming? Would a start
be made at once for the ranch? Why had the cowboys suddenly become so different? Madeline answered
as best she could; but her replies were only conjecture, and modified to allay the fears of
her guests. Helen was in a white glow of excitement.

Soon cowboys appeared riding barebacked horses, driving in others and the burros. Some of these
horses were taken away and evidently hidden in deep recesses between the crags. The string
of burros were packed and sent off down the trail in charge of a cowboy. Nick Steele and Monty
returned. Then Stewart appeared, clambering down the break between the cliffs.

His next move was to order all the baggage belonging to Madeline and her guests taken up the
cliff. This was strenuous toil, requiring the need of lassoes to haul up the effects.

"Get ready to climb," said Stewart, turning to Madelines party.

"Where?" asked Helen.

He waved his hand at the ascent to be made. Exclamations of dismay followed his gesture.

"Mr. Stewart, is there danger?" asked Dorothy; and her voice trembled.

This was the question Madeline had upon her lips to ask Stewart, but she could not speak it.

"No, there's no danger," replied Stewart, "but we're taking precautions we all agreed on as best."

Dorothy whispered that she believed Stewart lied. Castleton asked another question, and then
Harvey followed suit. Mrs. Beck made a timid query.

"Please keep quiet and do as you're told," said Stewart, bluntly.

At this juncture, when the last of the baggage was being hauled up the cliff, Monty approached
Madeline and removed his sombrero. His black face seemed the same, yet this was a vastly changed
Monty.

"Miss Hammond, I'm givin' notice I resign my job," he said.

"Monty! What do you mean? What does Nels mean now, when danger threatens?"

"We jest quit. Thet's all," replied Monty, tersely. He was stern and somber; he could not stand
still; his eyes roved everywhere.

Castleton jumped up from the log where he had been sitting, and his face was very red.

"Mr. Price, does all this blooming fuss mean we are to be robbed or attacked or abducted by
a lot of ragamuffin guerrillas?"

"You've called the bet."

Dorothy turned a very pale face toward Monty.

"Mr. Price, you wouldn't--you couldn't desert us now? You and Mr. Nels--"

"Desert you?" asked Monty, blankly.

"Yes, desert us. Leave us when we may need you so much, with something dreadful coming."

Monty uttered a short, hard laugh as he bent a strange look upon the girl.

"Me an' Nels is purty much scared, an' we're goin' to slope. Miss Dorothy, bein' as we've rustled
round so much; it sorta hurts us to see nice young girls dragged off by the hair."

Dorothy uttered a little cry and then became hysterical. Castleton for once was fully aroused.

"By Gad! You and your partner are a couple of blooming cowards. Where now is that courage you
boasted of?"

Monty's dark face expressed extreme sarcasm.

"Dook, in my time I've seen some bright fellers, but you take the cake. It's most marvelous
how bright you are. Figger'n' me an' Nels so correct. Say, Dook, if you don't git rustled off
to Mexico an' roped to a cactus-bush you'll hev a swell story fer your English chums. Bah Jove!
You'll tell 'em how you seen two old-time gun-men run like scared jack-rabbits from a lot of
Greasers. Like hell you will! Unless you lie like the time you told about proddin' the lion.
That there story allus--"

"Monty, shut up!" yelled Stewart, as he came hurriedly up. Then Monty slouched away, cursing
to himself.

Madeline and Helen, assisted by Castleton, worked over Dorothy, and with some difficulty quieted
her. Stewart passed several times without noticing them, and Monty, who had been so ridiculously
eager to pay every little attention to Dorothy, did not see her at all. Rude it seemed; in
Monty's ease more than that. Madeline hardly knew what to make of it.

Stewart directed cowboys to go to the head of the open place in the cliff and let down lassoes.
Then, with little waste of words, he urged the women toward this rough ladder of stones.

"We want to hide you," he said, when they demurred. "If the guerrillas come we'll tell them
you've all gone down to the ranch. If we have to fight you'll be safe up there."

Helen stepped boldly forward and let Stewart put the loop of a lasso round her and tighten
it. He waved his hand to the cowboys above.

"Just walk up, now," he directed Helen.

It proved to the watchers to be an easy, safe, and rapid means of scaling the steep passage.
The men climbed up without assistance. Mrs. Beck, as usual, had hysteria; she half walked and
was half dragged up. Stewart supported Dorothy with one arm, while with the other he held to
the lasso. Ambrose had to carry Christine. The Mexican women required no assistance. Edith
Wayne and Madeline climbed last; and, once up, Madeline saw a narrow bench, thick with shrubs,
and overshadowed by huge, leaning crags. There were holes in the rock, and dark fissures leading
back. It was a rough, wild place. Tarpaulins and bedding were then hauled up, and food and
water. The cowboys spread comfortable beds in several of the caves, and told Madeline and her
friends to be as quiet as possible, not to make a light, and to sleep dressed, ready for travel
at a moment's notice.

After the cowboys had gone down it was not a cheerful group left there in the darkening twilight.
Castleton prevailed upon them to eat.

"This is simply great," whispered Helen.

"Oh, it's awful!" moaned Dorothy. "It's your fault, Helen. You prayed for something to happen."

"I believe it's a horrid trick those cowboys are playing," said Mrs. Beck.

Madeline assured her friends that no trick was being played upon them, and that she deplored
the discomfort and distress, but felt no real alarm. She was more inclined to evasive kindness
here than to sincerity, for she had a decided uneasiness. The swift change in the manner and
looks of her cowboys had been a shock to her. The last glance she had of Stewart's face, then
stern, almost sad, and haggard with worry, remained to augment her foreboding.

Darkness appeared to drop swiftly down; the coyotes began their haunting, mournful howls; the
stars showed and grew brighter; the wind moaned through the tips of the pines. Castleton was
restless. He walked to and fro before the overhanging shelf of rock, where his companions sat
lamenting, and presently he went out to the ledge of the bench. The cowboys below had built
a fire, and the light from it rose in a huge, fan-shaped glow. Castleton's little figure stood
out black against this light. Curious and anxious also, Madeline joined him and peered down
from the cliff. The distance was short, and occasionally she could distinguish a word spoken
by the cowboys. They were unconcernedly cooking and eating. She marked the absence of Stewart,
and mentioned it to Castleton. Silently Castleton pointed almost straight down, and there in
the gloom stood Stewart, with the two stag-hounds at his feet.

Presently Nick Steele silenced the camp-fire circle by raising a warning hand. The cowboys
bent their heads, listening. Madeline listened with all her might. She heard one of the hounds
whine, then the faint beat of horse's hoofs. Nick spoke again and turned to his supper, and
the other men seemed to slacken in attention. The beat of hoofs grew louder, entered the grove,
then the circle of light. The rider was Nels. He dismounted, and the sound of his low voice
just reached Madeline.

"Gene, it's Nels. Somethin' doin'," Madeline heard one of the cowboys call, softly.

"Send him over," replied Stewart.

Nels stalked away from the fire.

"See here, Nels, the boys are all right, but I don't want them to know everything about this
mix-up," said Stewart, as Nels came up. "Did you find the girl?"

Madeline guessed that Stewart referred to the Mexican girl Bonita.

"No. But I met"--Madeline did not catch the name--"an' he was wild. He was with a forest-ranger.
An' they said Pat Hawe had trailed her an' was takin' her down under arrest."

Stewart muttered deep under his breath, evidently cursing.

"Wonder why he didn't come on up here?" he queried, presently. "He can see a trail."

"Wal, Gene, Pat knowed you was here all right, fer thet ranger said Pat hed wind of the guerrillas,
an' Pat said if Don Carlos didn't kill you--which he hoped he'd do--then it 'd be time enough
to put you in jail when you come down."

"He's dead set to arrest me, Nels."

"An' he'll do it, like the old lady who kept tavern out West. Gene, the reason thet red-faced
coyote didn't trail you up here is because he's scared. He allus was scared of you. But I reckon
he's shore scared to death of me an' Monty."

"Well, we'll take Pat in his turn. The thing now is, when will that Greaser stalk us, and what'll
we do when he comes?"

"My boy, there's only one way to handle a Greaser. I shore told you thet. He means rough toward
us. He'll come smilin' up, all soci'ble like, insinuatin' an' sweeter 'n a woman. But he's
treacherous; he's wuss than an Indian. An', Gene, we know for a positive fact how his gang
hev been operatin' between these hills an' Agua Prieta. They're no nervy gang of outlaws like
we used to hev. But they're plumb bad. They've raided and murdered through the San Luis Pass
an' Guadalupe Canyon. They've murdered women, an' wuss than thet, both north an' south of Agua
Prieta. Mebbe the U. S. cavalry don't know it, an' the good old States; but we, you an' me
an' Monty an' Nick, we know it. We know jest about what thet rebel war down there amounts to.
It's guerrilla war, an' shore some harvest-time fer a lot of cheap thieves an' outcasts."

"Oh, you're right, Nels. I'm not disputing that," replied Stewart. "If it wasn't for Miss Hammond
and the other women, I'd rather enjoy seeing you and Monty open up on that bunch. I'm thinking
I'd be glad to meet Don Carlos. But Miss Hammond! Why, Nels, such a woman as she is would never
recover from the sight of real gun-play, let alone any stunts with a rope. These Eastern women
are different. I'm not belittling our Western women. It's in the blood. Miss Hammond is--is--"

"Shore she is," interrupted Nels; "but she's got a damn sight more spunk than you think she
has, Gene Stewart. I'm no thick-skulled cow. I'd hate somethin' powerful to hev Miss Hammond
see any rough work, let alone me an' Monty startin' somethin'. An' me an' Monty'll stick to
you, Gene, as long as seems reasonable. Mind, ole feller, beggin' your pardon, you're shore
stuck on Miss Hammond, an' over-tender not to hurt her feelin's or make her sick by lettin'
some blood. We're in bad here, an' mebbe we'll hev to fight. Sabe, senor? Wal, we do you can
jest gamble thet Miss Hammond'll be game. An' I'll bet you a million pesos thet if you got
goin' onct, an' she seen you as I've seen you--wal, I know what she'd think of you. This old
world ain't changed much. Some women may be white-skinned an' soft-eyed an' sweet-voiced an'
high-souled, but they all like to see a man! Gene, here's your game. Let Don Carlos come along.
Be civil. If he an' his gang are hungry, feed 'em. Take even a little overbearin' Greaser talk.
Be blind if he wants his gang to steal somethin'. Let him think the women hev mosied down to
the ranch. But if he says you're lyin'--if he as much as looks round to see the women--jest
jump him same as you jumped Pat Hawe. Me an' Monty'll hang back fer thet, an' if your strong
bluff don't go through, if the Don's gang even thinks of flashin' guns, then we'll open up.
An' all I got to say is if them Greasers stand fer real gun-play they'll be the fust I ever seen."

"Nels, there are white men in that gang," said Stewart.

"Shore. But me an' Monty'll be thinkin' of thet. If they start anythin' it'll hev to be shore
quick."

"All right, Nels, old friend, and thanks," replied Stewart. Nels returned to the camp-fire,
and Stewart resumed his silent guard.

Madeline led Castleton away from the brink of the wall.

"By Jove! Cowboys are blooming strange folk!" he exclaimed. "They are not what they pretend to be."

"Indeed, you are right," replied Madeline. "I cannot understand them. Come, let us tell the
others that Nels and Monty were only talking and do not intend to leave us. Dorothy, at least,
will be less frightened if she knows."

Dorothy was somewhat comforted. The others, however, complained of the cowboys' singular behavior.
More than once the idea was advanced that an elaborate trick had been concocted. Upon general
discussion this idea gained ground. Madeline did not combat it, because she saw it tended to
a less perturbed condition of mind among her guests. Castleton for once proved that he was
not absolutely obtuse, and helped along the idea.

They sat talking in low voices until a late hour. The incident now began to take on the nature
of Helen's long-yearned-for adventure. Some of the party even grew merry in a subdued way.
Then, gradually, one by one they tired and went to bed. Helen vowed she could not sleep in
a place where there were bats and crawling things. Madeline fancied, however, that they all
went to sleep while she lay wide-eyed, staring up at the black bulge of overhanging rock and
beyond the starry sky.

To keep from thinking of Stewart and the burning anger he had caused her to feel for herself,
Madeline tried to keep her mind on other things. But thought of him recurred, and each time
there was a hot commotion in her breast hard to stifle. Intelligent reasoning seemed out of
her power. In the daylight it had been possible for her to be oblivious to Stewart's deceit
after the moment of its realization. At night, however, in the strange silence and hovering
shadows of gloom, with the speaking stars seeming to call to her, with the moan of the wind
in the pines, and the melancholy mourn of coyotes in the distance, she was not able to govern
her thought and emotion. The day was practical, cold; the night was strange and tense. In the
darkness she had fancies wholly unknown to her in the bright light of the sun. She battled
with a haunting thought. She had inadvertently heard Nels's conversation with Stewart; she
had listened, hoping to hear some good news or to hear the worst; she had learned both, and,
moreover, enlightenment on one point of Stewart's complex motives. He wished to spare her any
sight that might offend, frighten, or disgust her. Yet this Stewart, who showed a fineness
of feeling that might have been wanting even in Boyd Harvey, maintained a secret rendezvous
with that pretty, abandoned Bonita. Here always the hot shame, like a live, stinging, internal
fire, abruptly ended Madeline's thought. It was intolerable, and it was the more so because
she could neither control nor understand it. The hours wore on, and at length, as the stars
began to pale and there was no sound whatever, she fell asleep.

She was called out of her slumber. Day had broken bright and cool. The sun was still below
the eastern crags. Ambrose, with several other cowboys, had brought up buckets of spring-water,
and hot coffee and cakes. Madeline's party appeared to be none the worse for the night's experience.
Indeed, the meager breakfast might have been as merrily partaken of as it was hungrily had
not Ambrose enjoined silence.

"They're expectin' company down below," he said.

This information and the summary manner in which the cowboys soon led the party higher up among
the ruined shelves of rock caused a recurrence of anxiety. Madeline insisted on not going beyond
a projection of cliff from which she could see directly down into the camp. As the vantage-point
was one affording concealment, Ambrose consented, but he placed the frightened Christine near
Madeline and remained there himself.

"Ambrose, do you really think the guerrillas will come?" asked Madeline.

"Sure. We know. Nels just rode in and said they were on their way up. Miss Hammond, can I trust
you? You won't let out a squeal if there's a fight down there? Stewart told me to hide you
out of sight or keep you from lookin'."

"I promise not to make any noise," replied Madeline. Madeline arranged her coat so that she
could lie upon it, and settled down to wait developments. There came a slight rattling of stones
in the rear. She turned to see Helen sliding down a bank with a perplexed and troubled cowboy.
Helen came stooping low to where Madeline lay and said: "I am going to see what happens, if
I die in the attempt! I can stand it if you can." She was pale and big-eyed. Ambrose promptly
swore at the cowboy who had let her get away from him. "Take a half-hitch on her yourself an'
see where you end up," replied the fellow, and disappeared in the jumble of rocks. Ambrose,
finding words useless, sternly and heroically prepared to carry Helen back to the others. He
laid hold of her. In a fury, with eyes blazing, Helen whispered:

"Let go of me! Majesty, what does this fool mean?"

Madeline laughed. She knew Helen, and had marked the whisper, when ordinarily Helen would have
spoken imperiously, and not low. Madeline explained to her the exigency of the situation. "I
might run, but I'll never scream," said Helen. With that Ambrose had to be content to let her
stay. However, he found her a place somewhat farther back from Madeline's position, where he
said there was less danger of her being seen. Then he sternly bound her to silence, tarried
a moment to comfort Christine, and returned to where Madeline lay concealed. He had been there
scarcely a moment when he whispered:

"I hear hosses. The guerrillas are comin'."

Madeline's hiding-place was well protected from possible discovery from below. She could peep
over a kind of parapet, through an opening in the tips of the pines that reached up to the
cliff, and obtain a commanding view of the camp circle and its immediate surroundings. She
could not, however, see far either to right or left of the camp, owing to the obstructing foliage.
Presently the sound of horses' hoofs quickened the beat of her pulse and caused her to turn
keener gaze upon the cowboys below.

Although she had some inkling of the course Stewart and his men were to pursue, she was not
by any means prepared for the indifference she saw. Frank was asleep, or pretended to be. Three
cowboys were lazily and unconcernedly attending to camp-fire duties, such as baking biscuits,
watching the ovens, and washing tins and pots. The elaborate set of aluminum plates, cups,
etc., together with the other camp fixtures that had done service for Madeline's party, had
disappeared. Nick Steele sat with his back to a log, smoking his pipe. Another cowboy had just
brought the horses closer into camp, where they stood waiting to be saddled. Nels appeared
to be fussing over a pack. Stewart was rolling a cigarette. Monty had apparently nothing to
do for the present except whistle, which he was doing much more loudly than melodiously. The
whole ensemble gave an impression of careless indifference.

The sound of horses' hoofs grew louder and slowed its beat. One of the cowboys pointed down
the trail, toward which several of his comrades turned their heads for a moment, then went
on with their occupations.

Presently a shaggy, dusty horse bearing a lean, ragged, dark rider rode into camp and halted.
Another followed, and another. Horses with Mexican riders came in single file and stopped behind
the leader.

The cowboys looked up, and the guerrillas looked down. "Buenos dias, senor," ceremoniously
said the foremost guerrilla.

By straining her ears Madeline heard that voice, and she recognized it as belonging to Don
Carlos. His graceful bow to Stewart was also familiar. Otherwise she would never have recognized
the former elegant vaquero in this uncouth, roughly dressed Mexican.

Stewart answered the greeting in Spanish, and, waving his hand toward the camp-fire, added
in English, "Get down and eat."

The guerrillas were anything but slow in complying. They crowded to the fire, then spread in
a little circle and squatted upon the ground, laying their weapons beside them. In appearance
they tallied with the band of guerrillas that had carried Madeline up into the foothills, only
this band was larger and better armed. The men, moreover, were just as hungry and as wild and
beggarly. The cowboys were not cordial in their reception of this visit, but they were hospitable.
The law of the desert had always been to give food and drink to wayfaring men, whether lost
or hunted or hunting.

"There's twenty-three in that outfit," whispered Ambrose, "includin' four white men. Pretty
rummy outfit."

"They appear to be friendly enough," whispered Madeline.

"Things down there ain't what they seem," replied Ambrose.

"Ambrose, tell me--explain to me. This is my opportunity. As long as you will let me watch
them, please let me know the--the real thing."

"Sure. But recollect, Miss Hammond, that Gene'll give it to me good if he ever knows I let
you look and told you what's what. Well, decent-like Gene is seen' them poor devils get a square
meal. They're only a lot of calf-thieves in this country. Across the border they're bandits,
some of them, the others just riffraff outlaws. That rebel bluff doesn't go down with us. I'd
have to see first before I'd believe them Greasers would fight. They're a lot of hard-ridin'
thieves, and they'd steal a fellow's blanket or tobacco. Gene thinks they're after you ladies--to
carry you off. But Gene--Oh, Gene's some highfalutin in his ideas lately. Most of us boys think
the guerrillas are out to rob--that's all."

Whatever might have been the secret motive of Don Carlos and his men, they did not allow it
to interfere with a hearty appreciation of a generous amount of food. Plainly, each individual
ate all that he was able to eat at the time. They jabbered like a flock of parrots; some were
even merry, in a kind of wild way. Then, as each and every one began to roll and smoke the
inevitable cigarette of the Mexican, there was a subtle change in manner. They smoked and looked
about the camp, off into the woods, up at the crags, and back at the leisurely cowboys. They
had the air of men waiting for something.

"Senor," began Don Carlos, addressing Stewart. As he spoke he swept his sombrero to indicate
the camp circle.

Madeline could not distinguish his words, but his gesture plainly indicated a question in regard
to the rest of the camping party. Stewart's reply and the wave of his hand down the trail meant
that his party had gone home. Stewart turned to some task, and the guerrilla leader quietly
smoked. He looked cunning and thoughtful. His men gradually began to manifest a restlessness,
noticeable in the absence of former languor and slow puffing of cigarette smoke. Presently
a big-boned man with a bullet head and a blistered red face of evil coarseness got up and threw
away his cigarette. He was an American.

"Hey, cull," he called in loud voice, "ain't ye goin' to cough up a drink?"

"My boys don't carry liquor on the trail," replied Stewart. He turned now to face the guerrillas.

"Haw, haw! I heerd over in Rodeo thet ye was gittin' to be shore some fer temperance," said
this fellow. "I hate to drink water, but I guess I've gotter do it."

He went to the spring, sprawled down to drink, and all of a sudden he thrust his arm down in
the water to bring forth a basket. The cowboys in the hurry of packing had neglected to remove
this basket; and it contained bottles of wine and liquors for Madeline's guests. They had been
submerged in the spring to keep them cold. The guerrilla fumbled with the lid, opened it, and
then got up, uttering a loud roar of delight.

Stewart made an almost imperceptible motion, as if to leap forward; but he checked the impulse,
and after a quick glance at Nels he said to the guerrilla:

"Guess my party forgot that. You're welcome to it." Like bees the guerrillas swarmed around
the lucky finder of the bottles. There was a babel of voices. The drink did not last long,
and it served only to liberate the spirit of recklessness. The several white outlaws began
to prowl around the camp; some of the Mexicans did likewise; others waited, showing by their
ill-concealed expectancy the nature of their thoughts.

It was the demeanor of Stewart and his comrades that puzzled Madeline. Apparently they felt
no anxiety or even particular interest. Don Carlos, who had been covertly watching them, now
made his scrutiny open, even aggressive. He looked from Stewart to Nels and Monty, and then
to the other cowboys. While some of his men prowled around the others watched him, and the
waiting attitude had taken on something sinister. The guerrilla leader seemed undecided, but
not in any sense puzzled. When he turned his cunning face upon Nels and Monty he had the manner
of a man in whom decision was lacking.

In her growing excitement Madeline had not clearly heard Ambrose's low whispers and she made
an effort to distract some of her attention from those below to the cowboy crouching beside her.

The quality, the note of Ambrose's whisper had changed. It had a slight sibilant sound.

"Don't be mad if sudden-like I clap my hands over your eyes, Miss Hammond," he was saying.
"Somethin's brewin' below. I never seen Gene so cool. That's a dangerous sign in him. And look,
see how the boys are workin' together! Oh, it's slow and accident-like, but I know it's sure
not accident. That foxy Greaser knows, too. But maybe his men don't. If they are wise they
haven't sense enough to care. The Don, though--he's worried. He's not payin' so much attention
to Gene, either. It's Nels and Monty he's watchin'. And well he need do it! There, Nick and
Frank have settled down on that log with Booly. They don't seem to be packin' guns. But look
how heavy their vests hang. A gun in each side! Those boys can pull a gun and flop over that
log quicker than you can think. Do you notice how Nels and Monty and Gene are square between
them guerrillas and the trail up here? It doesn't seem on purpose, but it is. Look at Nels
and Monty. How quiet they are confabbin' together, payin' no attention to the guerrillas. I
see Monty look at Gene, then I see Nels look at Gene. Well, it's up to Gene. And they're goin'
to back him. I reckon, Miss Hammond, there'd be dead Greasers round that camp long ago if Nels
and Monty were foot-loose. They're beholdin' to Gene. That's plain. And, Lord! how it tickles
me to watch them! Both packin' two forty-fives, butts swingin' clear. There's twenty-four shots
in them four guns. And there's twenty-three guerrillas. If Nels and Monty ever throw guns at
that close range, why, before you'd know what was up there'd be a pile of Greasers. There!
Stewart said something to the Don. I wonder what. I'll gamble it was something to get the Don's
outfit all close together. Sure! Greasers have no sense. But them white guerrillas, they're
lookin' some dubious. Whatever's comin' off will come soon, you can bet. I wish I was down
there. But maybe it won't come to a scrap. Stewart's set on avoidin' that. He's a wonderful
chap to get his way. Lord, though, I'd like to see him go after that overbearin' Greaser! See!
the Don can't stand prosperity. All this strange behavior of cowboys is beyond his pulque-soaked
brains. Then he's a Greaser. If Gene doesn't knock him on the head presently he'll begin to
get over his scare, even of Nels and Monty. But Gene'll pick out the right time. And I'm gettin'
nervous. I want somethin' to start. Never saw Nels in but one fight, then he just shot a Greaser's
arm off for tryin' to draw on him. But I've heard all about him. And Monty! Monty's the real
old-fashioned gun-man. Why, none of them stories, them lies he told to entertain the Englishman,
was a marker to what Monty has done. What I don't understand is how Monty keeps so quiet and
easy and peaceful-like. That's not his way, with such an outfit lookin' for trouble. O-ha!
Now for the grand bluff. Looks like no fight at all!"

The guerrilla leader had ceased his restless steps and glances, and turned to Stewart with
something of bold resolution in his aspect.

"Gracias, senor," he said. "Adios." He swept his sombrero in the direction of the trail leading
down the mountain to the ranch; and as he completed the gesture a smile, crafty and jeering,
crossed his swarthy face.

Ambrose whispered so low that Madeline scarcely heard him. "If the Greaser goes that way he'll
find our horses and get wise to the trick. Oh, he's wise now! But I'll gamble he never even
starts on that trail."

Neither hurriedly nor guardedly Stewart rose out of his leaning posture and took a couple of
long strides toward Don Carlos.

"Go back the way you came," he fairly yelled; and his voice had the ring of a bugle.

Ambrose nudged Madeline; his whisper was tense and rapid: "Don't miss nothin'. Gene's called
him. Whatever's comin' off will be here quick as lightnin'. See! I guess maybe that Greaser
don't savvy good U. S. lingo. Look at that dirty yaller face turn green. Put one eye on Nels
and Monty! That's great--just to see 'em. Just as quiet and easy. But oh, the difference! Bent
and stiff--that means every muscle is like a rawhide riata. They're watchin' with eyes that
can see the workin's of them Greasers' minds. Now there ain't a hoss-hair between them Greasers
and hell!"

Don Carlos gave Stewart one long malignant stare; then he threw back his head, swept up the
sombrero, and his evil smile showed gleaming teeth.

"Senor--" he began.

With magnificent bound Stewart was upon him. The guerrilla's cry was throttled in his throat.
A fierce wrestling ensued, too swift to see clearly; then heavy, sodden blows, and Don Carlos
was beaten to the ground. Stewart leaped back. Then, crouching with his hands on the butts
of guns at his hips, he yelled, he thundered at the guerrillas. He had been quicker than a
panther, and now his voice was so terrible that it curdled Madeline's blood, and the menace
of deadly violence in his crouching position made her shut her eyes. But she had to open them.
In that single instant Nels and Monty had leaped to Stewart's side. Both were bent down, with
hands on the butts of guns at their hips. Nels's piercing yell seemed to divide Monty's roar
of rage. Then they ceased, and echoes clapped from the crags. The silence of those three men
crouching like tigers about to leap was more menacing than the nerve-racking yells.

Then the guerrillas wavered and broke and ran for their horses. Don Carlos rolled over, rose,
and staggered away, to be helped upon his mount. He looked back, his pale and bloody face that
of a thwarted demon. The whole band got into action and were gone in a moment.

"I knew it," declared Ambrose. "Never seen a Greaser who could face gun-play. That was some
warm. And Monty Price never flashed a gun! He'll never get over that. I reckon, Miss Harnmond,
we're some lucky to avoid trouble. Gene had his way, as you seen. We'll be makin' tracks for
the ranch in about two shakes."

"Why?" whispered Madeline, breathlessly. She became conscious that she was weak and shaken.

"Because the guerrillas sure will get their nerve back, and come sneakin' on our trail or try
to head us off by ambushin'," replied Ambrose. "That's their way. Otherwise three cowboys couldn't
bluff a whole gang like that. Gene knows the nature of Greasers. They're white-livered. But
I reckon we're in more danger now than before, unless we get a good start down the mountain.
There! Gene's callin'. Come! Hurry!"

Helen had slipped down from her vantage-point, and therefore had not seen the last act in that
little camp-fire drama. It seemed, however, that her desire for excitement was satisfied, for
her face was pale and she trembled when she asked if the guerrillas were gone.

"I didn't see the finish, but those horrible yells were enough for me."

Ambrose hurried the three women over the rough rocks, down the cliff. The cowboys below were
saddling horses in haste. Evidently all the horses had been brought out of hiding. Swiftly,
with regard only for life and limb, Madeline, Helen, and Christine were lowered by lassoes
and half carried down to the level. By the time they were safely down the other members of
the party appeared on the cliff above. A trunks of gray'entrancement which are however given for scenting

Nels disappeared. Quick as a cat Monty glided out. Madeline heard his soft, swift steps pass
from her room into her office. He had left his guns there. Madeline trembled. She saw Stewart
get up quietly and without any change of expression on his dark, sad face leave the patio.
Nick Steele followed him. Stillwell dropped his wine-glass. As it broke, shivering the silence,
his huge smile vanished. His face set into the old cragginess and the red slowly thickened
into black. Stillwell went out and closed the door behind him.

Then there was a blank silence. The enjoyment of the moment had been rudely disrupted. Madeline
glanced down the lines of brown faces to see the pleasure fade into the old familiar hardness.

"What's wrong?" asked Alfred, rather stupidly. The change of mood had been too rapid for him.
Suddenly he awakened, thoroughly aroused at the interruption. "I'm going to see who's butted
in here to spoil our dinner," he said, and strode out.

He returned before any one at the table had spoken or moved, and now the dull red of anger
mottled his forehead.

"It's the sheriff of El Cajon!" he exclaimed, contemptuously. "Pat Hawe with some of his tough
deputies come to arrest Gene Stewart. They've got that poor little Mexican girl out there tied
on a horse. Confound that sheriff!"

Madeline calmly rose from the table, eluding Florence's entreating hand, and started for the
door. The cowboys jumped up. Alfred barred her progress.

"Alfred, I am going out," she said.

"No, I guess not," he replied. "That's no place for you."

"I am going." She looked straight at him.

"Madeline! Why, what is it? You look--Dear, there's pretty sure to be trouble outside. Maybe
there'll be a fight. You can do nothing. You must not go."

"Perhaps I can prevent trouble," she replied.

As she left the patio she was aware that Alfred, with Florence at his side and the cowboys
behind, were starting to follow her. When she got out of her room upon the porch she heard
several men in loud, angry discussion. Then, at sight of Bonita helplessly and cruelly bound
upon a horse, pale and disheveled and suffering, Madeline experienced the thrill that sight
or mention of this girl always gave her. It yielded to a hot pang in her breast--that live
pain which so shamed her. But almost instantly, as a second glance showed an agony in Bonita's
face, her bruised arms where the rope bit deep into the flesh, her little brown hands stained
with blood, Madeline was overcome by pity for the unfortunate girl and a woman's righteous
passion at such barbarous treatment of one of her own sex.

The man holding the bridle of the horse on which Bonita had been bound was at once recognized
by Madeline as the big-bodied, bullet-headed guerrilla who had found the basket of wine in
the spring at camp. Redder of face, blacker of beard, coarser of aspect, evidently under the
influence of liquor, he was as fierce-looking as a gorilla and as repulsive. Besides him there
were three other men present, all mounted on weary horses. The one in the foreground, gaunt,
sharp-featured, red-eyed, with a pointed beard, she recognized as the sheriff of El Cajon.

Madeline hesitated, then stopped in the middle of the porch. Alfred, Florence, and several
others followed her out; the rest of the cowboys and guests crowded the windows and doors.
Stillwell saw Madeline, and, throwing up his hands, roared to be heard. This quieted the gesticulating,
quarreling men.

"Wal now, Pat Hawe, what's drivin' you like a locoed steer on the rampage?" demanded Stillwell.

"Keep in the traces, Bill," replied Hawe. "You savvy what I come fer. I've been bidin' my time.
But I'm ready now. I'm hyar to arrest a criminal."

The huge frame of the old cattleman jerked as if he had been stabbed. His face turned purple.

"What criminal?" he shouted, hoarsely.

The sheriff flicked his quirt against his dirty boot, and he twisted his thin lips into a leer.
The situation was agreeable to him.

"Why, Bill, I knowed you hed a no-good outfit ridin' this range; but I wasn't wise thet you
hed more 'n one criminal."

"Cut that talk! Which cowboy are you wantin' to arrest?"

Hawe's manner altered.

"Gene Stewart," he replied, curtly.

"On what charge?"

"Fer killin' a Greaser one night last fall."

"So you're still harpin' on that? Pat, you're on the wrong trail. You can't lay that killin'
onto Stewart. The thing's ancient by now. But if you insist on bringin' him to court, let the
arrest go to-day--we're hevin' some fiesta hyar--an' I'll fetch Gene in to El Cajon."

"Nope. I reckon I'll take him when I got the chance, before he slopes."

"I'm givin' you my word," thundered Stillwell.

"I reckon I don't hev to take your word, Bill, or anybody else's."

Stillwell's great bulk quivered with his rage, yet he made a successful effort to control it.

"See hyar, Pat Hawe, I know what's reasonable. Law is law. But in this country there always
has been an' is now a safe an' sane way to proceed with the law. Mebbe you've forgot that.
The law as invested in one man in a wild country is liable, owin' to that man's weaknesses
an' onlimited authority, to be disputed even by a decent ole cattleman like myself. I'm a-goin'
to give you a hunch. Pat, you're not overliked in these parts. You've rid too much with a high
hand. Some of your deals hev been shady, an' don't you overlook what I'm sayin'. But you're
the sheriff, an' I'm respectin' your office. I'm respectin' it this much. If the milk of human
decency is so soured in your breast that you can't hev a kind feelin', then try to avoid the
onpleasantness that'll result from any contrary move on your part to-day. Do you get that hunch?"

"Stillwell, you're threatenin' an officer," replied Hawe, angrily.

"Will you hit the trail quick out of hyar?" queried Stillwell, in strained voice. "I guarantee
Stewart's appearance in El Cajon any day you say."

"No. I come to arrest him, an' I'm goin' to."

"So that's your game!" shouted Stillwell. "We-all are glad to get you straight, Pat. Now listen,
you cheap, red-eyed coyote of a sheriff! You don't care how many enemies you make. You know
you'll never get office again in this county. What do you care now? It's amazin' strange how
earnest you are to hunt down the man who killed that particular Greaser. I reckon there's been
some dozen or more killin's of Greasers in the last year. Why don't you take to trailin' some
of them killin's? I'll tell you why. You're afraid to go near the border. An' your hate of
Gene Stewart makes you want to hound him an' put him where he's never been yet--in jail. You
want to spite his friends. Wal, listen, you lean-jawed, skunk-bitten coyote! Go ahead an' try
to arrest him!"

Stillwell took one mighty stride off the porch. His last words had been cold. His rage appeared
to have been transferred to Hawe. The sheriff had begun to stutter and shake a lanky red hand
at the cattleman when Stewart stepped out.

"Here, you fellows, give me a chance to say a word."

As Stewart appeared the Mexican girl suddenly seemed vitalized out of her stupor. She strained
at her bonds, as if to lift her hands beseechingly. A flush animated her haggard face, and
her big dark eyes lighted.

"Senor Gene!" she moaned. "Help me! I so seek. They beat me, rope me, 'mos' keel me. Oh, help
me, Senor Gene!"

"Shut up, er I'll gag you," said the man who held Bonita's horse.

"Muzzle her, Sneed, if she blabs again," called Hawe. Madeline felt something tense and strained
working in the short silence. Was it only a phase of her thrilling excitement? Her swift glance
showed the faces of Nels and Monty and Nick to be brooding, cold, watchful. She wondered why
Stewart did not look toward Bonita. He, too, was now dark-faced, cool, quiet, with something
ominous about him.

"Hawe, I'll submit to arrest without any fuss," he said, slowly, "if you'll take the ropes
off that girl."

"Nope," replied the sheriff. "She got away from me onct. She's hawg-tied now, an' she'll stay
hawg-tied."

Madeline thought she saw Stewart give a slight start. But an unaccountable dimness came over
her eyes, at brief intervals obscuring her keen sight. Vaguely she was conscious of a clogged
and beating tumult in her breast.

"All right, let's hurry out of here," said Stewart. "You've made annoyance enough. Ride down
to the corral with me. I'll get my horse and go with you."

"Hold on!" yelled Hawe, as Stewart turned away. "Not so fast. Who's doin' this? You don't come
no El Capitan stunts on me. You'll ride one of my pack-horses, an' you'll go in irons."

"You want to handcuff me?" queried Stewart, with sudden swift start of passion.

"Want to? Haw, haw! Nope, Stewart, thet's jest my way with hoss-thieves, raiders, Greasers,
murderers, an' sich. See hyar, you Sneed, git off an' put the irons on this man."

The guerrilla called Sneed slid off his horse and began to fumble in his saddle-bags.

"You see, Bill," went on Hawe, "I swore in a new depooty fer this particular job. Sneed is
some handy. He rounded up thet little Mexican cat fer me."

Stillwell did not hear the sheriff; he was gazing at Stewart in a kind of imploring amaze.

"Gene, you ain't goin' to stand fer them handcuffs?" he pleaded.

"Yes," replied the cowboy. "Bill, old friend, I'm an outsider here. There's no call for Miss
Hammond and--and her brother and Florence to be worried further about me. Their happy day has
already been spoiled on my account. I want to get out quick."

"Wal, you might be too damn considerate of Miss Hammond's sensitive feelin's." There was now
no trace of the courteous, kindly old rancher. He looked harder than stone. "How about my feelin's?
I want to know if you're goin' to let this sneakin' coyote, this last gasp of the old rum-guzzlin'
frontier sheriffs, put you in irons an' hawg-tie you an' drive you off to jail?"

"Yes," replied Stewart, steadily.

"Wal, by Gawd! You, Gene Stewart! What's come over you? Why, man, go in the house, an' I'll
'tend to this feller. Then to-morrow you can ride in an' give yourself up like a gentleman."

"No. I'll go. Thanks, Bill, for the way you and the boys would stick to me. Hurry, Hawe, before
my mind changes."

His voice broke at the last, betraying the wonderful control he had kept over his passions.
As he ceased speaking he seemed suddenly to become spiritless. He dropped his head.

Madeline saw in him then a semblance to the hopeless, shamed Stewart of earlier days. The vague
riot in her breast leaped into conscious fury--a woman's passionate repudiation of Stewart's
broken spirit. It was not that she would have him be a lawbreaker; it was that she could not
bear to see him deny his manhood. Once she had entreated him to become her kind of a cowboy--a
man in whom reason tempered passion. She had let him see how painful and shocking any violence
was to her. And the idea had obsessed him, softened him, had grown like a stultifying lichen
upon his will, had shorn him of a wild, bold spirit she now strangely longed to see him feel.
When the man Sneed came forward, jingling the iron fetters, Madeline's blood turned to fire.
She would have forgiven Stewart then for lapsing into the kind of cowboy it had been her blind
and sickly sentiment to abhor. This was a man's West--a man's game. What right had a woman
reared in a softer mold to use her beauty and her influence to change a man who was bold and
free and strong? At that moment, with her blood hot and racing, she would have gloried in the
violence which she had so deplored: she would have welcomed the action that had characterized
Stewart's treatment of Don Carlos; she had in her the sudden dawning temper of a woman who
had been assimilating the life and nature around her and who would not have turned her eyes
away from a harsh and bloody deed.

But Stewart held forth his hands to be manacled. Then Madeline heard her own voice burst out
in a ringing, imperious "Wait!"

In the time it took her to make the few steps to the edge of the porch, facing the men, she
not only felt her anger and justice and pride summoning forces to her command, but there was
something else calling--a deep, passionate, mysterious thing not born of the moment.

Sneed dropped the manacles. Stewart's face took on a chalky whiteness. Hawe, in a slow, stupid
embarrassment beyond his control, removed his sombrero in a respect that seemed wrenched from him.

"Mr. Hawe, I can prove to you that Stewart was not concerned in any way whatever with the crime
for which you want to arrest him."

The sheriff's stare underwent a blinking change. He coughed, stammered, and tried to speak.
Manifestly, he had been thrown completely off his balance. Astonishment slowly merged into
discomfiture.

"It was absolutely impossible for Stewart to have been connected with that assault," went on
Madeline, swiftly, "for he was with me in the waiting-room of the station at the moment the
assault was made outside. I assure you I have a distinct and vivid recollection. The door was
open. I heard the voices of quarreling men. They grew louder. The language was Spanish. Evidently
these men had left the dance-hall opposite and were approaching the station. I heard a woman's
voice mingling with the others. It, too, was Spanish, and I could not understand. But the tone
was beseeching. Then I heard footsteps on the gravel. I knew Stewart heard them. I could see
from his face that something dreadful was about to happen. Just outside the door then there
were hoarse, furious voices, a scuffle, a muffled shot, a woman's cry, the thud of a falling
body, and rapid footsteps of a man running away. Next, the girl Bonita staggered into the door.
She was white, trembling, terror-stricken. She recognized Stewart, appealed to him. Stewart
supported her and endeavored to calm her. He was excited. He asked her if Danny Mains had been
shot, or if he had done the shooting. The girl said no. She told Stewart that she had danced
a little, flirted a little with vaqueros, and they had quarreled over her. Then Stewart took
her outside and put her upon his horse. I saw the girl ride that horse down the street to disappear
in the darkness."

While Madeline spoke another change appeared to be working in the man Hawe. He was not long
disconcerted, but his discomfiture wore to a sullen fury, and his sharp features fixed in an
expression of craft.

"Thet's mighty interestin', Miss Hammond, 'most as interestin' as a story-book," he said. "Now,
since you're so obligin' a witness, I'd sure like to put a question or two. What time did you
arrive at El Cajon thet night?"

"It was after eleven o'clock," replied Madeline.

"Nobody there to meet you?"

"No."

"The station agent an' operator both gone?"

"Yes."

"Wal, how soon did this feller Stewart show up?" Hawe continued, with a wry smile.

"Very soon after my arrival. I think--perhaps fifteen minutes, possibly a little more."

"Some dark an' lonesome around thet station, wasn't it?"

"Indeed yes."

"An' what time was the Greaser shot?" queried Hawe, with his little eyes gleaming like coals.

"Probably close to half past one. It was two o'clock when I looked at my watch at Florence
Kingsley's house. Directly after Stewart sent Bonita away he took me to Miss Kingsley's. So,
allowing for the walk and a few minutes' conversation with her, I can pretty definitely say
the shooting took place at about half past one."

Stillwell heaved his big frame a step closer to the sheriff. "What 're you drivin' at?" he
roared, his face black again.

"Evidence," snapped Hawe.

Madeline marveled at this interruption; and as Stewart irresistibly drew her glance she saw
him gray-faced as ashes, shaking, utterly unnerved.

"I thank you, Miss Hammond," he said, huskily. "But you needn't answer any more of Hawe's questions.
He's--he's--It's not necessary. I'll go with him now, under arrest. Bonita will corroborate
your testimony in court, and that will save me from this--this man's spite."

Madeline, looking at Stewart, seeing a humility she at first took for cowardice, suddenly divined
that it was not fear for himself which made him dread further disclosures of that night, but
fear for her--fear of shame she might suffer through him.

Pat Hawe cocked his head to one side, like a vulture about to strike with his beak, and cunningly
eyed Madeline.

"Considered as testimony, what you've said is sure important an' conclusive. But I'm calculatin'
thet the court will want to hev explained why you stayed from eleven-thirty till one-thirty
in thet waitin'-room alone with Stewart."

His deliberate speech met with what Madeline imagined a remarkable reception from Stewart,
who gave a tigerish start; from Stillwell, whose big hands tore at the neck of his shirt, as
if he was choking; from Alfred, who now strode hotly forward, to be stopped by the cold and
silent Nels; from Monty Price, who uttered a violent "Aw!" which was both a hiss and a roar.

In the rush of her thought Madeline could not interpret the meaning of these things which seemed
so strange at that moment. But they were portentous. Even as she was forming a reply to Hawe's
speech she felt a chill creep over her.

"Stewart detained me in the waiting-room," she said, clear-voiced as a bell. "But we were not
alone--all the time."

For a moment the only sound following her words was a gasp from Stewart. Hawe's face became
transformed with a hideous amaze and joy.

"Detained?" he whispered, craning his lean and corded neck. "How's thet?"

"Stewart was drunk. He--"

With sudden passionate gesture of despair Stewart appealed to her:

"Oh, Miss Hammond, don't! don't! DON'T!..."

Then he seemed to sink down, head lowered upon his breast, in utter shame. Stillwell's great
hand swept to the bowed shoulder, and he turned to Madeline.

"Miss Majesty, I reckon you'd be wise to tell all," said the old cattleman, gravely. "There
ain't one of us who could misunderstand any motive or act of yours. Mebbe a stroke of lightnin'
might clear this murky air. Whatever Gene Stewart did that onlucky night--you tell it."

Madeline's dignity and self-possession had been disturbed by Stewart's importunity. She broke
into swift, disconnected speech:

"He came into the station--a few minutes after I got there. I asked-to be shown to a hotel.
He said there wasn't any that would accommodate married women. He grasped my hand--looked for
a wedding-ring. Then I saw he was--he was intoxicated. He told me he would go for a hotel porter.
But he came back with a padre--Padre Marcos. The poor priest was--terribly frightened. So was
I. Stewart had turned into a devil. He fired his gun at the padre's feet. He pushed me into
a bench. Again he shot--right before my face. I--I nearly fainted. But I heard him cursing
the padre--heard the padre praying or chanting--I didn't know what. Stewart tried to make me
say things in Spanish. All at once he asked my name. I told him. He jerked at my veil. I took
it off. Then he threw his gun down--pushed the padre out of the door. That was just before
the vaqueros approached with Bonita. Padre Marcos must have seen them--must have heard them.
After that Stewart grew quickly sober. He was mortified--distressed--stricken with shame. He
told me he had been drinking at a wedding--I remember, it was Ed Linton's wedding. Then he
explained--the boys were always gambling--he wagered he would marry the first girl who arrived
at El Cajon. I happened to be the first one. He tried to force me to marry him. The rest--relating
to the assault on the vaquero--I have already told you."

Madeline ended, out of breath and panting, with her hands pressed upon her heaving bosom. Revelation
of that secret liberated emotion; those hurried outspoken words had made her throb and tremble
and burn. Strangely then she thought of Alfred and his wrath. But he stood motionless, as if
dazed. Stillwell was trying to holster up the crushed Stewart.

Hawe rolled his red eyes and threw back his head.

"Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Say, Sneed, you didn't miss any of it, did ye? Haw, haw! Best I ever
heerd in all my born days. Ho, ho!"

Then he ceased laughing, and with glinting gaze upon Madeline, insolent and vicious and savage,
he began to drawl:

"Wal now, my lady, I reckon your story, if it tallies with Bonita's an' Padre Marcos's, will
clear Gene Stewart in the eyes of the court." Here he grew slower, more biting, sharper and
harder of face. "But you needn't expect Pat Hawe or the court to swaller thet part of your
story--about bein' detained unwillin'!"

Madeline had not time to grasp the sense of his last words. Stewart had convulsively sprung
upward, white as chalk. As he leaped at Hawe Stillwell interposed his huge bulk and wrapped
his arms around Stewart. There was a brief, whirling, wrestling struggle. Stewart appeared
to be besting the old cattleman.

"Help, boys, help!" yelled Stillwell. "I can't hold him. Hurry, or there's goin' to be blood
spilled!"

Nick Steele and several cowboys leaped to Stillwell's assistance. Stewart, getting free, tossed
one aside and then another. They closed in on him. For an instant a furious straining wrestle
of powerful bodies made rasp and shock and blow. Once Stewart heaved them from him. But they
plunged back upon him--conquered him.

"Gene! Why, Gene!" panted the old cattleman. "Sure you're locoed--to act this way. Cool down!
Cool down! Why, boy, it's all right. Jest stand still--give us a chance to talk to you. It's
only ole Bill, you know--your ole pal who's tried to be a daddy to you. He's only wantin' you
to hev sense--to be cool--to wait."

"Let me go! Let me go!" cried Stewart; and the poignancy of that cry pierced Madeline's heart.
"Let me go, Bill, if you're my friend. I saved your life once--over in the desert. You swore
you'd never forget. Boys, make him let me go! Oh, I don't care what Hawe's said or done to
me! It was that about her! Are you all a lot of Greasers? How can you stand it? Damn you for
a lot of cowards! There's a limit, I tell you." Then his voice broke, fell to a whisper. "Bill,
dear old Bill, let me go. I'll kill him! You know I'll kill him!"

"Gene, I know you'd kill him if you hed an even break," replied Stillwell, soothingly. "But,
Gene, why, you ain't even packin' a gun! An' there's Pat lookin' nasty, with his hand nervous-like.
He seen you hed no gun. He'd jump at the chance to plug you now, an' then holler about opposition
to the law. Cool down, son; it'll all come right."

Suddenly Madeline was transfixed by a terrible sound.

Her startled glance shifted from the anxious group round Stewart to see that Monty Price had
leaped off the porch. He crouched down with his bands below his hips, where the big guns swung.
From his distorted lips issued that which was combined roar and bellow and Indian war-whoop,
and, more than all, a horrible warning cry. He resembled a hunchback about to make the leap
of a demon. He was quivering, vibrating. His eyes, black and hot, were fastened with most piercing
intentness upon Hawe and Sneed.

"Git back, Bill, git back!" he roared. "Git 'em back!" With one lunge Stillwell shoved Stewart
and Nick and the other cowboys up on the porch. Then he crowded Madeline and Alfred and Florence
to the wall, tried to force them farther. His motions were rapid and stern. But failing to
get them through door and windows, he planted his wide person between the women and danger.
Madeline grasped his arm, held on, and peered fearfully from behind his broad shoulder.

"You, Hawe! You, Sneed!" called Monty, in that same wild voice. "Don't you move a finger or
an eyelash!"

Madeline's faculties nerved to keen, thrilling divination. She grasped the relation between
Monty's terrible cry and the strange hunched posture he had assumed. Stillwell's haste and
silence, too, were pregnant of catastrophe.

"Nels, git in this!" yelled Monty; and all the time he never shifted his intent gaze as much
as a hair's-breadth from Hawe and his deputy. "Nels, chase away them two fellers hangin' back
there. Chase 'em, quick!"

These men, the two deputies who had remained in the background with the pack-horses, did not
wait for Nels. They spurred their mounts, wheeled, and galloped away.

"Now, Nels, cut the gurl loose," ordered Monty.

Nels ran forward, jerked the halter out of Sneed's hand, and pulled Bonita's horse in close
to the porch. As he slit the rope which bound her she fell into his arms.

"Hawe, git down!" went on Monty. "Face front an' stiff!"

The sheriff swung his leg, and, never moving his hands, with his face now a deathly, sickening
white, he slid to the ground.

"Line up there beside your guerrilla pard. There! You two make a damn fine pictoor, a damn
fine team of pizened coyote an' a cross between a wild mule an' a Greaser. Now listen!"

Monty made a long pause, in which his breathing was plainly audible.

Madeline's eyes were riveted upon Monty. Her mind, swift as lightning, had gathered the subtleties
in action and word succeeding his domination of the men. Violence, terrible violence, the thing
she had felt, the thing she had feared, the thing she had sought to eliminate from among her
cowboys, was, after many months, about to be enacted before her eyes. It had come at last.
She had softened Stillwell, she had influenced Nels, she had changed Stewart; but this little
black-faced, terrible Monty Price now rose, as it were, out of his past wild years, and no
power on earth or in heaven could stay his hand. It was the hard life of wild men in a wild
country that was about to strike this blow at her. She did not shudder; she did not wish to
blot out from sight this little man, terrible in his mood of wild justice. To daytime, did i leave for

 He watched for a movement
from the other two. It did not come. Then, with a terrible smile, he slid back and stretched out.

XXI. Unbridled

In waking and sleeping hours Madeline Hammond could not release herself from the thralling
memory of that tragedy. She was haunted by Monty Price's terrible smile. Only in action of
some kind could she escape; and to that end she worked, she walked and rode. She even overcame
a strong feeling, which she feared was unreasonable disgust, for the Mexican girl Bonita, who
lay ill at the ranch, bruised and feverish, in need of skilful nursing.

Madeline felt there was something inscrutable changing her soul. That strife--the struggle
to decide her destiny for East or West--held still further aloof. She was never spiritually
alone. There was a step on her trail. Indoors she was oppressed. She required the open--the
light and wind, the sight of endless slope, the sounds of corral and pond and field, physical
things, natural things.

One afternoon she rode down to the alfalfa-fields, round them, and back up to the spillway
of the lower lake, where a group of mesquite-trees, owing to the water that seeped through
the sand to their roots, had taken on bloom and beauty of renewed life. Under these trees there
was shade enough to make a pleasant place to linger. Madeline dismounted, desiring to rest
a little. She liked this quiet, lonely spot. It was really the only secluded nook near the
house. If she rode down into the valley or out to the mesa or up on the foothills she could
not go alone. Probably now Stillwell or Nels knew her whereabouts. But as she was comparatively
hidden here, she imagined a solitude that was not actually hers.

Her horse, Majesty, tossed his head and flung his mane and switched his tail at the flies.
He would rather have been cutting the wind down the valley slope. Madeline sat with her back
against a tree, and took off her sombrero. The soft breeze, fanning her hot face, blowing strands
of her hair, was refreshingly cool. She heard the slow tramp of cattle going in to drink. That
sound ceased, and the grove of mesquites appeared to be lifeless, except for her and her horse.
It was, however, only after moments of attention that she found the place was far from being
dead. Keen eyes and ears brought reward. Desert quail, as gray as the bare earth, were dusting
themselves in a shady spot. A bee, swift as light, hummed by. She saw a horned toad, the color
of stone, squatting low, hiding fearfully in the sand within reach of her whip. She extended
the point of the whip, and the toad quivered and swelled and hissed. It was instinct with fight.
The wind faintly stirred the thin foliage of the mesquites, making a mournful sigh. From far
up in the foothills, barely distinguishable, came the scream of an eagle. The bray of a burro
brought a brief, discordant break. Then a brown bird darted down from an unseen perch and made
a swift, irregular flight after a fluttering winged insect. Madeline heard the sharp snapping
of a merciless beak. Indeed, there was more than life in the shade of the mesquites.

Suddenly Majesty picked up his long ears and snorted. Then Madeline heard a slow pad of hoofs.
A horse was approaching from the direction of the lake. Madeline had learned to be wary, and,
mounting Majesty, she turned him toward the open. A moment later she felt glad of her caution,
for, looking back between the trees, she saw Stewart leading a horse into the grove. She would
as lief have met a guerrilla as this cowboy.

Majesty had broken into a trot when a shrill whistle rent the air. The horse leaped and, wheeling
so swiftly that he nearly unseated Madeline, he charged back straight for the mesquites. Madeline
spoke to him, cried angrily at him, pulled with all her strength upon the bridle, but was helplessly
unable to stop him. He whistled a piercing blast. Madeline realized then that Stewart, his
old master, had called him and that nothing could turn him. She gave up trying, and attended
to the urgent need of intercepting mesquite boughs that Majesty thrashed into motion. The horse
thumped into an aisle between the trees and, stopping before Stewart, whinnied eagerly.

Madeline, not knowing what to expect, had not time for any feeling but amaze. A quick glance
showed her Stewart in rough garb, dressed for the trail, and leading a wiry horse, saddled
and packed. When Stewart, without looking at her, put his arm around Majesty's neck and laid
his face against the flowing mane Madeline's heart suddenly began to beat with unwonted quickness.
Stewart seemed oblivious to her presence. His eyes were closed. His dark face softened, lost
its hardness and fierceness and sadness, and for an instant became beautiful.

Madeline instantly divined what his action meant. He was leaving the ranch; this was his good-by
to his horse. How strange, sad, fine was this love between man and beast! A dimness confused
Madeline's eyes; she hurriedly brushed it away, and it came back wet and blurring. She averted
her face, ashamed of the tears Stewart might see. She was sorry for him. He was going away,
and this time, judging from the nature of his farewell to his horse, it was to be forever.
Like a stab from a cold blade a pain shot through Madeline's heart. The wonder of it, the incomprehensibility
of it, the utter newness and strangeness of this sharp pain that now left behind a dull pang,
made her forget Stewart, her surroundings, everything except to search her heart. Maybe here
was the secret that had eluded her. She trembled on the brink of something unknown. In some
strange way the emotion brought back her girlhood. Her mind revolved swift queries and replies;
she was living, feeling, learning; happiness mocked at her from behind a barred door, and the
bar of that door seemed to be an inexplicable pain. Then like lightning strokes shot the questions:
Why should pain hide her happiness? What was her happiness? What relation had it to this man?
Why should she feel strangely about his departure? And the voices within her were silenced,
stunned, unanswered.

"I want to talk to you," said Stewart.

Madeline started, turned to him, and now she saw the earlier Stewart, the man who reminded
her of their first meeting at El Cajon, of that memorable meeting at Chiricahua.

"I want to ask you something," he went on. "I've been wanting to know something. That's why
I've hung on here. You never spoke to me, never noticed me, never gave me a chance to ask you.
But now I'm going over--over the border. And I want to know. Why did you refuse to listen to me?"

At his last words that hot shame, tenfold more stifling than when it had before humiliated
Madeline, rushed over her, sending the scarlet in a wave to her temples. It seemed that his
words made her realize she was actually face to face with him, that somehow a shame she would
rather have died than revealed was being liberated. Biting her lips to hold back speech, she
jerked on Majesty's bridle, struck him with her whip, spurred him. Stewart's iron arm held
the horse. Then Madeline, in a flash of passion, struck at Stewart's face, missed it, struck
again, and hit. With one pull, almost drawing her from the saddle, he tore the whip from her
hands. It was not that action on his part, or the sudden strong masterfulness of his look,
so much as the livid mark on his face where the whip had lashed that quieted, if it did not
check, her fury.

"That's nothing," he said, with something of his old audacity. "That's nothing to how you've
hurt me."

Madeline battled with herself for control. This man would not be denied. Never before had the
hardness of his face, the flinty hardness of these desert-bred men, so struck her with its
revelation of the unbridled spirit. He looked stern, haggard, bitter. The dark shade was changing
to gray--the gray to ash-color of passion. About him now there was only the ghost of that finer,
gentler man she had helped to bring into being. The piercing dark eyes he bent upon her burned
her, went through her as if he were looking into her soul. Then Madeline's quick sight caught
a fleeting doubt, a wistfulness, a surprised and saddened certainty in his eyes, saw it shade
and pass away. Her woman's intuition, as keen as her sight, told her Stewart in that moment
had sustained a shock of bitter, final truth.

For the third time he repeated his question to her. Madeline did not answer; she could not speak. 

You had particularly muddle when the things were butted on yawl-distant cockatoos, the end in

 Now, say it! Speak!"

White-hot, blinded, utterly in the fiery grasp of passion, powerless to stem the rush of a
word both shameful and revealing and fatal, Madeline cried:

"YES!"

He had wrenched that word from her, but he was not subtle enough, not versed in the mystery
of woman's motive enough, to divine the deep significance of her reply.

For him the word had only literal meaning confirming the dishonor in which she held him. Dropping
her arm, he shrank back, a strange action for the savage and crude man she judged him to be.

"But that day at Chiricahua you spoke of faith," he burst out. "You said the greatest thing
in the world was faith in human nature. You said the finest men had been those who had fallen
low and had risen. You said you had faith in me! You made me have faith in myself!"

His reproach, without bitterness or scorn, was a lash to her old egoistic belief in her fairness.
She had preached a beautiful principle that she had failed to live up to. She understood his
rebuke, she wondered and wavered, but the affront to her pride had been too great, the tumult
within her breast had been too startlingly fierce; she could not speak, the moment passed,
and with it his brief, rugged splendor of simplicity.

"You think I am vile," he said. "You think that about Bonita! And all the time I've been...
I could make you ashamed--I could tell you--"

His passionate utterance ceased with a snap of his teeth. His lips set in a thin, bitter line.
The agitation of his face preceded a convulsive wrestling of his shoulders. All this swift
action denoted an inner combat, and it nearly overwhelmed him.

"No, no!" he panted. Was it his answer to some mighty temptation? Then, like a bent sapling
released, he sprang erect. "But I'll be the man--the dog--you think me!"

He laid hold of her arm with rude, powerful clutch. One pull drew her sliding half out of the
saddle into his arms. She fell with her breast against his, not wholly free of stirrups or
horse, and there she hung, utterly powerless. Maddened, writhing, she tore to release herself.
All she could accomplish was to twist herself, raise herself high enough to see his face. That
almost paralyzed her. Did he mean to kill her? Then he wrapped his arms around her and crushed
her tighter, closer to him. She felt the pound of his heart; her own seemed to have frozen.
Then he pressed his burning lips to hers. It was a long, terrible kiss. She felt him shake.

"Oh, Stewart! I--implore--you--let--me--go!" she whispered.

His white face loomed over hers. She closed her eyes. He rained kisses upon her face, but no
more upon her mouth. On her closed eyes, her hair, her cheeks, her neck he pressed swift lips--lips
that lost their fire and grew cold. Then he released her, and, lifting and righting her in
the saddle, he still held her arm to keep her from falling.

For a moment Madeline sat on her horse with shut eyes. She dreaded the light.

"Now you can't say you've never been kissed," Stewart said. His voice seemed a long way off.
"But that was coming to you, so be game. Here!"

She felt something hard and cold and metallic thrust into her hand. He made her fingers close
over it, hold it. The feel of the thing revived her. She opened her eyes. Stewart had given
her his gun. He stood with his broad breast against her knee, and she looked up to see that
old mocking smile on his face.

"Go ahead! Throw my gun on me! Be a thoroughbred!"

Madeline did not yet grasp his meaning.

"You can put me down in that quiet place on the hill--beside Monty Price."

Madeline dropped the gun with a shuddering cry of horror. The sense of his words, the memory
of Monty, the certainty that she would kill Stewart if she held the gun an instant longer,
tortured the self-accusing cry from her.

Stewart stooped to pick up the weapon.

"You might have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble," he said, with another flash of the mocking
smile. "You're beautiful and sweet and proud, but you're no thoroughbred! Majesty Hammond, adios!"

Stewart leaped for the saddle of his horse, and with the flying mount crashed through the mesquites
to disappear.

XXII. The Secret Told

In the shaded seclusion of her room, buried face down deep among the soft cushions on her couch,
Madeline Hammond lay prostrate and quivering under the outrage she had suffered.

The afternoon wore away; twilight fell; night came; and then Madeline rose to sit by the window
to let the cool wind blow upon her hot face. She passed through hours of unintelligible shame
and impotent rage and futile striving to reason away her defilement.

The train of brightening stars seemed to mock her with their unattainable passionless serenity.
She had loved them, and now she imagined she hated them and everything connected with this
wild, fateful, and abrupt West.

She would go home.

Edith Wayne had been right; the West was no place for Madeline Hammond. The decision to go
home came easily, naturally, she thought, as the result of events. It caused her no mental
strife. Indeed, she fancied she felt relief. The great stars, blinking white and cold over
the dark crags, looked down upon her, and, as always, after she had watched them for a while
they enthralled her. "Under Western stars," she mused, thinking a little scornfully of the
romantic destiny they had blazed for her idle sentiment. But they were beautiful; they were
speaking; they were mocking; they drew her. "Ah!" she sighed. "It will not be so very easy
to leave them, after all."

Madeline closed and darkened the window. She struck a light. It was necessary to tell the anxious
servants who knocked that she was well and required nothing. A soft step on the walk outside
arrested her. Who was there--Nels or Nick Steele or Stillwell? Who shared the guardianship
over her, now that Monty Price was dead and that other--that savage--? It was monstrous and
unfathomable that she regretted him.

The light annoyed her. Complete darkness fitted her strange mood. She retired and tried to
compose herself to sleep. Sleep for her was not a matter of will. Her cheeks burned so hotly
that she rose to bathe them. Cold water would not alleviate this burn, and then, despairing
of forgetfulness, she lay down again with a shameful gratitude for the cloak of night. Stewart's
kisses were there, scorching her lips, her closed eyes, her swelling neck. They penetrated
deeper and deeper into her blood, into her heart, into her soul--the terrible farewell kisses
of a passionate, hardened man. Despite his baseness, he had loved her.

Late in the night Madeline fell asleep. In the morning she was pale and languid, but in a mental
condition that promised composure.

It was considerably after her regular hour that Madeline repaired to her office. The door was
open, and just outside, tipped back in a chair, sat Stillwell.

"Mawnin', Miss Majesty," he said, as he rose to greet her with his usual courtesy. There were
signs of trouble in his lined face. Madeline shrank inwardly, fearing his old lamentations
about Stewart. Then she saw a dusty, ragged pony in the yard and a little burro drooping under
a heavy pack. Both animals bore evidence of long, arduous travel.

"To whom do they belong?" asked Madeline.

"Them critters? Why, Danny Mains," replied Stillwell, with a cough that betrayed embarrassment.

"Danny Mains?" echoed Madeline, wonderingly.

"Wal, I said so."

Stillwell was indeed not himself.

"Is Danny Mains here?" she asked, in sudden curiosity.

The old cattleman nodded gloomily.

"Yep, he's hyar, all right. Sloped in from the hills, an' he hollered to see Bonita. He's locoed,
too, about that little black-eyed hussy. Why, he hardly said, 'Howdy, Bill,' before he begun
to ask wild an' eager questions. I took him in to see Bonita. He's been there more 'n a half-hour
now."

Evidently Stillwell's sensitive feelings had been ruffled. Madeline's curiosity changed to
blank astonishment, which left her with a thrilling premonition. She caught her breath. A thousand
thoughts seemed thronging for clear conception in her mind.

Rapid footsteps with an accompaniment of clinking spurs sounded in the hallway. Then a young
man ran out upon the porch. He resembled a cowboy in his lithe build, his garb and action,
in the way he wore his gun, but his face, instead of being red, was clear brown tan. His eyes
were blue; his hair was light and curly. He was a handsome, frank-faced boy. At sight of Madeline
he slammed down his sombrero and, leaping at her, he possessed himself of her hands. His swift
violence not only alarmed her, but painfully reminded her of something she wished to forget.

This cowboy bent his head and kissed her hands and wrung them, and when he straightened up
he was crying.

"Miss Hammond, she's safe an' almost well, an' what I feared most ain't so, thank God," he
cried. Adoxography, i think he asked, her telephoned, look can do it asked, Title. Subsidization was

"The Lost Mine of the Padres!" cried Danny, in stentorian voice. "An' it belongs to me!"

Stillwell made some incoherent sound as he sat up fascinated, quite beside himself.

"Bill, it was some long time ago since you saw me," said Danny. "Fact is, I know how you felt,
because Gene kept me posted. I happened to run across Bonita, an' I wasn't goin' to let her
ride away alone, when she told me she was in trouble. We hit the trail for the Peloncillos.
Bonita had Gene's horse, an' she was to meet him up on the trail. We got to the mountains all
right, an' nearly starved for a few days till Gene found us. He had got in trouble himself
an' couldn't fetch much with him.

"We made for the crags an' built a cabin. I come down that day Gene sent his horse Majesty
to you. Never saw Gene so broken-hearted. Well, after he sloped for the border Bonita an' I
were hard put to it to keep alive. But we got along, an' I think it was then she began to care
a little for me. Because I was decent. I killed cougars an' went down to Rodeo to get bounties
for the skins, an' bought grub an' supplies I needed. Once I went to El Cajon an' run plumb
into Gene. He was back from the revolution an' cuttin' up some. But I got away from him after
doin' all I could to drag him out of town. A long time after that Gene trailed up to the crags
an' found us. Gene had stopped drinkin', he'd changed wonderful, was fine an' dandy. It was
then he began to pester the life out of me to make me marry Bonita. I was happy, so was she,
an' I was some scared of spoilin' it. Bonita had been a little flirt, an' I was afraid she'd
get shy of a halter, so I bucked against Gene. But I was all locoed, as it turned out. Gene
would come up occasionally, packin' supplies for us, an' always he'd get after me to do the
right thing by Bonita. Gene's so dog-gone hard to buck against! I had to give in, an' I asked
Bonita to marry me. Well, she wouldn't at first--said she wasn't good enough for me. But I
saw the marriage idea was workin' deep, an' I just kept on bein' as decent as I knew how. So
it was my wantin' to marry Bonita--my bein' glad to marry her--that made her grow soft an'
sweet an' pretty as--as a mountain quail. Gene fetched up Padre Marcos, an' he married us."

Danny paused in his narrative, breathing hard, as if the memory of the incident described had
stirred strong and thrilling feeling in him. Stillwell's smile was rapturous. Madeline leaned
toward Danny with her eyes shining.

"Miss Hammond, an' you, Bill Stillwell, now listen, for this is strange I've got to tell you.
The afternoon Bonita an' I were married, when Gene an' the padre had gone, I was happy one
minute an' low-hearted the next. I was miserable because I had a bad name. I couldn't buy even
a decent dress for my pretty wife. Bonita heard me, an' she was some mysterious. She told me
the story of the lost mine of the padres, an' she kissed me an made joyful over me in the strangest
way. I knew marriage went to women's heads, an' I thought even Bonita had a spell.

"Well, she left me for a little, an' when she came back she wore some pretty yellow flowers
in her hair. Her eyes were big an' black an' beautiful. She said some queer things about spirits
rollin' rocks down the canyon. Then she said she wanted to show me where she always sat an'
waited an' watched for me when I was away.

"She led me around under the crags to a long slope. It was some pretty there--clear an' open,
with a long sweep, an' the desert yawnin' deep an' red. There were yellow flowers on that slope,
the same kind she had in her hair--the same kind that Apache girl wore hundreds of years ago
when she led the padre to the gold-mine.

"When I thought of that, an' saw Bonita's eyes, an' then heard the strange crack of rollin'
rocks--heard them rattle down an' roll an' grow faint--I was some out of my head. But not for
long. Them rocks were rollin' all right, only it was the weatherin' of the cliffs.

"An' there under the crags was a gold pocket.

"Then I was worse than locoed. I went gold-crazy. I worked like seventeen burros. Bill, I dug
a lot of goldbearin' quartz. Bonita watched the trails for me, brought me water. That was how
she come to get caught by Pat Hawe an' his guerrillas. Sure! Pat Hawe was so set on doin' Gene
dirt that he mixed up with Don Carlos. Bonita will tell you some staggerin' news about that
outfit. Just now my story is all gold."

Danny Mains got up and kicked back his chair. Blue lightning gleamed from his eyes as he thrust
a hand toward Stillwell.

"Bill, old pal, put her there--give me your hand," he said. "You were always my friend. You
had faith in me. Well, Danny Mains owes you, an' he owes Gene Stewart a good deal, an' Danny
Mains pays. I want two pardners to help me work my gold-mine. You an' Gene. If there's any
ranch hereabouts that takes your fancy I'll buy it. If Miss Hammond ever gets tired of her
range an stock an' home I'll buy them for Gene. If there's any railroad or town round here
that she likes I'll buy it. If I see anythin' myself that I like I'll buy it. Go out; find
Gene for me. I'm achin' to see him, to tell him. Go fetch him; an' right here in this house,
with my wife an' Miss Hammond as witnesses, we'll draw up a pardnership. Go find him, Bill.
I want to show him this gold, show him how Danny Mains pays! An' the only bitter drop in my
cup to-day is that I can't ever pay Monty Price."

          *****

Madeline's lips tremblingly formed to tell Danny Mains and Stillwell that the cowboy they wanted
so much had left the ranch; but the flame of fine loyalty that burned in Danny's eyes, the
happiness that made the old cattleman's face at once amazing and beautiful, stiffened her lips.
She watched the huge Stillwell and the little cowboy, both talking wildly, as they walked off
arm in arm to find Stewart. She imagined something of what Danny's disappointment would be,
of the elder man's consternation and grief, when he learned Stewart had left for the border.
At this juncture she looked up to see a strange, yet familiar figure approaching. Padre Marcos!
Certain it was that Madeline felt herself trembling. What did his presence mean on this day?
He had always avoided meeting her whenever possible. He had been exceedingly grateful for all
she had done for his people, his church, and himself; but he had never thanked her in person.
Perhaps he had come for that purpose now. But Madeline did not believe so.

Mention of Padre Marcos, sight of him, had always occasioned Madeline a little indefinable
shock; and now, as he stepped to the porch, a shrunken, stooped, and sad-faced man, she was
startled.

The padre bowed low to her.

"Senora, will you grant me audience?" he asked, in perfect English, and his voice was low-toned
and grave.

"Certainly, Padre Marcos," replied Madeline; and she led him into her office.

"May I beg to close the doors?" he asked. "It is a matter of great moment, which you might
not care to have any one hear."

Wonderingly Madeline inclined her head. The padre gently closed one door and then the others.

"Senora, I have come to disclose a secret--my own sinfulness in keeping it--and to implore
your pardon. Do you remember that night Senor Stewart dragged me before you in the waiting-room
at El Cajon?"

"Yes," replied Madeline.

"Senora, since that night you have been Senor Stewart's wife!"

Madeline became as motionless as stone. She seemed to feel nothing, only to hear.

"You are Senor Stewart's wife. I have kept the secret under fear of death. But I could keep
it no longer. Senor Stewart may kill me now. Ah, Senora, it is very strange to you. You were
so frightened that night, you knew not what happened. Senor Stewart threatened me. He forced
you. He made me speak the service. He made you speak the Spanish yes. And I, Senora, knowing
the deeds of these sinful cowboys, fearing worse than disgrace to one so beautiful and so good
as you, I could not do less than marry you truly. At least you should be his wife. So I married
you, truly, in the service of my church."

"My God!" cried Madeline, rising.

"Hear me! I implore you, Senora, hear me out! Do not leave me! Do not look so--so--Ah, Senora,
let me speak a word for Senor Stewart. He was drunk that night. He did not know what he was
about. In the morning he came to me, made me swear by my cross that I would not reveal the
disgrace he had put upon you. If I did he would kill me. Life is nothing to the American vaquero,
Senora. I promised to respect his command. But I did not tell him you were his wife. He did
not dream I had truly married you. He went to fight for the freedom of my country--Senora,
he is one splendid soldier--and I brooded over the sin of my secret. If he were killed I need
never tell you. But if he lived I knew that I must some day.

"Strange indeed that Senor Stewart and Padre Marcos should both come to this ranch together.
The great change your goodness wrought in my beloved people was no greater than the change
in Senor Stewart. Senora, I feared you would go away one day, go back to your Eastern home,
ignorant of the truth. The time came when I confessed to Stewart--said I must tell you. Senor,
the man went mad with joy. I have never seen so supreme a joy. He threatened no more to kill
me. That strong, cruel vaquero begged me not to tell the secret--never to reveal it. He confessed
his love for you--a love something like the desert storm. He swore by all that was once sacred
to him, and by my cross and my church, that he would be a good man, that he would be worthy
to have you secretly his wife for the little time life left him to worship at your shrine.
You needed never to know. So I held my tongue, half pitying him, half fearing him, and praying
for some God-sent light.

"Senora, it was a fool's paradise that Stewart lived in. I saw him, often. When he took me
up into the mountains to have me marry that wayward Bonita and her lover I came to have respect
for a man whose ideas about nature and life and God were at a variance with mine. But the man
is a worshiper of God in all material things. He is a part of the wind and sun and desert and
mountain that have made him. I have never heard more beautiful words than those in which he
persuaded Bonita to accept Senor Mains, to forget her old lovers, and henceforth to be happy.
He is their friend. I wish I could tell you what that means. It sounds so simple. It is really
simple. All great things are so. For Senor Stewart it was natural to be loyal to his friend,
to have a fine sense of the honor due to a woman who had loved and given, to bring about their
marriage, to succor them in their need and loneliness. It was natural for him never to speak
of them. It would have been natural for him to give his life in their defense if peril menaced
them. Senora, I want you to understand that to me the man has the same stability, the same
strength, the same elements which I am in the habit of attributing to the physical life around
me in this wild and rugged desert."

Madeline listened as one under a spell. It was not only that this soft-voiced, eloquent priest
knew how to move the heart, stir the soul; but his defense, his praise of Stewart, if they
had been couched in the crude speech of cowboys, would have been a glory to her.

"Senora, I pray you, do not misunderstand my mission. Beyond my confession to you I have only
a duty to tell you of the man whose wife you are. But I am a priest and I can read the soul.
The ways of God are inscrutable. I am only a humble instrument. You are a noble woman, and
Senor Stewart is a man of desert iron forged anew in the crucible of love. Quien sabe? Senor
Stewart swore he would kill me if I betrayed him. But he will not lift his hand against me.
For the man bears you a very great and pure love, and it has changed him. I no longer fear
his threat, but I do fear his anger, should he ever know I spoke of his love, of his fool's
paradise. I have watched his dark face turned to the sun setting over the desert. I have watched
him lift it to the light of the stars. Think, my gracious and noble lady, think what is his
paradise? To love you above the spirit of the flesh; to know you are his wife, his, never to
be another's except by his sacrifice; to watch you with a secret glory of joy and pride; to
stand, while he might, between you and evil; to find his happiness in service; to wait, with
never a dream of telling you, for the hour to come when to leave you free he must go out and
get himself shot! Senora, that is beautiful, it is sublime, it is terrible. It has brought
me to you with my confession. I repeat, Senora, the ways of God are inscrutable. What is the
meaning of your influence upon Senor Stewart? Once he was merely an animal, brutal, unquickened;
now he is a man--I have not seen his like! So I beseech you in my humble office as priest,
as a lover of mankind, before you send Stewart to his death, to be sure there is here no mysterious
dispensation of God. Love, that mighty and blessed and unknown thing, might be at work. Senora,
I have heard that somewhere in the rich Eastern cities you are a very great lady. I know you
are good and noble. That is all I want to know. To me you are only a woman, the same as Senor
Stewart is only a man. So I pray you, Senora, before you let Stewart give you freedom at such
cost be sure you do not want his love, lest you cast away something sweet and ennobling which
you yourself have created."

XXIII. The Light of Western Stars

Blinded, like a wild creature, Madeline Hammond ran to her room. She felt as if a stroke of
lightning had shattered the shadowy substance of the dream she had made of real life. The wonder
of Danny Mains's story, the strange regret with which she had realized her injustice to Stewart,
the astounding secret as revealed by Padre Marcos--these were forgotten in the sudden consciousness
of her own love.

Madeline fled as if pursued. With trembling hands she locked the doors, drew the blinds of
the windows that opened on the porch, pushed chairs aside so that she could pace the length
of her room. She was now alone, and she walked with soft, hurried, uneven steps. She could
be herself here; she needed no mask; the long habit of serenely hiding the truth from the world
and from herself could be broken. The seclusion of her darkened chamber made possible that
betrayal of herself to which she was impelled.

She paused in her swift pacing to and fro. She liberated the thought that knocked at the gates
of her mind. With quivering lips she whispered it. Then she spoke aloud:

"I will say it--hear it. I--I love him!"

"I love him!" she repeated the astounding truth, but she doubted her identity.

"Am I still Madeline Hammond? What has happened? Who am I?" She stood where the light from
one unclosed window fell upon her image in the mirror. "Who is this woman?"

She expected to see a familiar, dignified person, a quiet, unruffled figure, a tranquil face
with dark, proud eyes and calm, proud lips. No, she did not see Madeline Hammond. She did not
see any one she knew. Were her eyes, like her heart, playing her false? The figure before her
was instinct with pulsating life. The hands she saw, clasped together, pressed deep into a
swelling bosom that heaved with each panting breath. The face she saw--white, rapt, strangely
glowing, with parted, quivering lips, with great, staring, tragic eyes--this could not be Madeline
Hammond's face.

Yet as she looked she knew no fancy could really deceive her, that she was only Madeline Hammond
come at last to the end of brooding dreams. She swiftly realized the change in her, divined
its cause and meaning, accepted it as inevitable, and straightway fell back again into the
mood of bewildering amaze.

Calmness was unattainable. The surprise absorbed her. She could not go back to count the innumerable,
imperceptible steps of her undoing. Her old power of reflecting, analyzing, even thinking at
all, seemed to have vanished in a pulse-stirring sense of one new emotion. She only felt all
her instinctive outward action that was a physical relief, all her involuntary inner strife
that was maddening, yet unutterably sweet; and they seemed to be just one bewildering effect
of surprise.

In a nature like hers, where strength of feeling had long been inhibited as a matter of training,
such a transforming surprise as sudden consciousness of passionate love required time for its
awakening, time for its sway.

By and by that last enlightening moment came, and Madeline Hammond faced not only the love
in her heart, but the thought of the man she loved.

Suddenly, as she raged, something in her--this dauntless new personality--took arms against
indictment of Gene Stewart. Her mind whirled about him and his life. She saw him drunk, brutal;
she saw him abandoned, lost. Then out of the picture she had of him thus slowly grew one of
a different man--weak, sick, changed by shock, growing strong, strangely, spiritually altered,
silent, lonely like an eagle, secretive, tireless, faithful, soft as a woman, hard as iron
to endure, and at the last noble.

She softened. In a flash her complex mood changed to one wherein she thought of the truth,
the beauty, the wonder of Stewart's uplifting. Humbly she trusted that she had helped him to
climb. That influence had been the best she had ever exerted. It had wrought magic in her own
character. By it she had reached some higher, nobler plane of trust in man. She had received
infinitely more than she had given.

Her swiftly flying memory seemed to assort a vast mine of treasures of the past. Of that letter
Stewart had written to her brother she saw vivid words. But ah! she had known, and if it had
not made any difference then, now it made all in the world. She recalled how her loosened hair
had blown across his lips that night he had ridden down from the mountains carrying her in
his arms. She recalled the strange joy of pride in Stewart's eyes when he had suddenly come
upon her dressed to receive her Eastern guests in the white gown with the red roses at her breast.

Swiftly as they had come these dreamful memories departed. There was to be no rest for her
mind. All she had thought and felt seemed only to presage a tumult.

Heedless, desperate, she cast off the last remnant of self-control, turned from the old proud,
pale, cold, self-contained ghost of herself to face this strange, strong, passionate woman.
Then, with hands pressed to her beating heart, with eyes shut, she listened to the ringing
trip-hammer voice of circumstance, of truth, of fatality. The whole story was revealed, simple
enough in the sum of its complicated details, strange and beautiful in part, remorseless in
its proof of great love on Stewart's side, in dreaming blindness on her own, and, from the
first fatal moment to the last, prophetic of tragedy.

Madeline, like a prisoner in a cell, began again to pace to and fro.

"Oh, it is all terrible!" she cried. "I am his wife. His wife! That meeting with him--the marriage--then
his fall, his love, his rise, his silence, his pride! And I can never be anything to him. Could
I be anything to him? I, Madeline Hammond? But I am his wife, and I love him! His wife! I am
the wife of a cowboy! That might be undone. Can my love be undone? Ah, do I want anything undone?
He is gone. Gone! Could he have meant--I will not, dare not think of that. He will come back.
No, he never will come back. Oh, what shall I do?"

          *****

For Madeline Hammond the days following that storm of feeling were leaden-footed, endless,
hopeless--a long succession of weary hours, sleepless hours, passionate hours, all haunted
by a fear slowly growing into torture, a fear that Stewart had crossed the border to invite
the bullet which would give her freedom. The day came when she knew this to be true. The spiritual
tidings reached her, not subtly as so many divinations had come, but in a clear, vital flash
of certainty. Then she suffered. She burned inwardly, and the nature of that deep fire showed
through her eyes. She kept to herself, waiting, waiting for her fears to be confirmed.

At times she broke out in wrath at the circumstances she had failed to control, at herself,
at Stewart.

"He might have learned from Ambrose!" she exclaimed, sick with a bitterness she knew was not
consistent with her pride. She recalled Christine's trenchant exposition of Ambrose's wooing:
"He tell me he love me; he kees me; he hug me; he put me on his horse; he ride away with me;
he marry me."

Then in the next breath Madeline denied this insistent clamoring of a love that was gradually
breaking her spirit. Like a somber shadow remorse followed her, shading blacker. She had been
blind to a man's honesty, manliness, uprightness, faith, and striving. She had been dead to
love, to nobility that she had herself created. Padre Marcos's grave, wise words returned to
haunt her. She fought her bitterness, scorned her intelligence, hated her pride, and, weakening,
gave up more and more to a yearning, hopeless hope.

She had shunned the light of the stars as she had violently dismissed every hinting suggestive
memory of Stewart's kisses. But one night she went deliberately to her window. There they shone.
Her stars! Beautiful, passionless as always, but strangely closer, warmer, speaking a kinder
language, helpful as they had never been, teaching her now that regret was futile, revealing
to her in their one grand, blazing task the supreme duty of life--to be true.

Those shining stars made her yield. She whispered to them that they had claimed her--the West
claimed her--Stewart claimed her forever, whether he lived or died. She gave up to her love.
And it was as if he was there in person, dark-faced, fire-eyed, violent in his action, crushing
her to his breast in that farewell moment, kissing her with one burning kiss of passion, then
with cold, terrible lips of renunciation.

"I am your wife!" she whispered to him. In that moment, throbbing, exalted, quivering in her
first sweet, tumultuous surrender to love, she would have given her all, her life, to be in
his arms again, to meet his lips, to put forever out of his power any thought of wild sacrifice.

          *****

And on the morning of the next day, when Madeline went out upon the porch, Stillwell, haggard
and stern, with a husky, incoherent word, handed her a message from El Cajon. She read:

El Capitan Stewart captured by rebel soldiers in fight at Agua Prieta yesterday. He was a sharpshooter
in the Federal ranks. Sentenced to death Thursday at sunset.

XXIV. The Ride

"Stillwell!"

Madeline's cry was more than the utterance of a breaking heart. It was full of agony. But also
it uttered the shattering of a structure built of false pride, of old beliefs, of bloodless
standards, of ignorance of self. It betrayed the final conquest of her doubts, and out of their
darkness blazed the unquenchable spirit of a woman who had found herself, her love, her salvation,
her duty to a man, and who would not be cheated.

The old cattleman stood mute before her, staring at her white face, at her eyes of flame.

"Stillwell! I am Stewart's wife!"

"My Gawd, Miss Majesty!" he burst out. "I knowed somethin' turrible was wrong. Aw, sure it's
a pity--"

"Do you think I'll let him be shot when I know him now, when I'm no longer blind, when I love
him?" she asked, with passionate swiftness. "I will save him. This is Wednesday morning. I
have thirty-six hours to save his life. Stillwell, send for Link and the car!"

She went into her office. Her mind worked with extraordinary rapidity and clearness. Her plan,
born in one lightning-like flash of thought, necessitated the careful wording of telegrams
to Washington, to New York, to San Antonio. These were to Senators, Representatives, men high
in public and private life, men who would remember her and who would serve her to their utmost.
Never before had her position meant anything to her comparable with what it meant now. Never
in all her life had money seemed the power that it was then. If she had been poor! A shuddering
chill froze the thought at its inception. She dispelled heartbreaking thoughts. She had power.
She had wealth. She would set into operation all the unlimited means these gave her--the wires
and pulleys and strings underneath the surface of political and international life, the open,
free, purchasing value of money or the deep, underground, mysterious, incalculably powerful
influence moved by gold. She could save Stewart. She must await results--deadlocked in feeling,
strained perhaps almost beyond endurance, because the suspense would be great; but she would
allow no possibility of failure to enter her mind.

When she went outside the car was there with Link, helmet in hand, a cool, bright gleam in
his eyes, and with Stillwell, losing his haggard misery, beginning to respond to Madeline's spirit.

"Link, drive Stillwell to El Cajon in time for him to catch the El Paso train," she said. "Wait
there for his return, and if any message comes from him, telephone it at once to me."

Then she gave Stillwell the telegrams to send from El Cajon and drafts to cash in El Paso.
She instructed him to go before the rebel junta, then stationed at Juarez, to explain the situation,
to bid them expect communications from Washington officials requesting and advising Stewart's
exchange as a prisoner of war, to offer to buy his release from the rebel authorities.

When Stillwell had heard her through his huge, bowed form straightened, a ghost of his old
smile just moved his lips. He was no longer young, and hope could not at once drive away stern
and grim realities. As he bent over her hand his manner appeared courtly and reverent. But
either he was speechless or felt the moment not one for him to break silence.

He climbed to a seat beside Link, who pocketed the watch he had been studying and leaned over
the wheel. There was a crack, a muffled sound bursting into a roar, and the big car jerked
forward to bound over the edge of the slope, to leap down the long incline, to shoot out upon
the level valley floor and disappear in moving dust.

For the first time in days Madeline visited the gardens, the corrals, the lakes, the quarters
of the cowboys. Though imagining she was calm, she feared she looked strange to Nels, to Nick,
to Frankie Slade, to those boys best known to her. The situation for them must have been one
of tormenting pain and bewilderment. They acted as if they wanted to say something to her,
but found themselves spellbound. She wondered--did they know she was Stewart's wife? Stillwell
had not had time to tell them; besides, he would not have mentioned the fact. These cowboys
only knew that Stewart was sentenced to be shot; they knew if Madeline had not been angry with
him he would not have gone in desperate fighting mood across the border. She spoke of the weather,
of the horses and cattle, asked Nels when he was to go on duty, and turned away from the wide,
sunlit, adobe-arched porch where the cowboys stood silent and bareheaded. Then one of her subtle
impulses checked her.

"Nels, you and Nick need not go on duty to-day," she said. "I may want you. I--I--"

She hesitated, paused, and stood lingering there. Her glance had fallen upon Stewart's big
black horse prancing in a near-by corral.

"I have sent Stillwell to El Paso," she went on, in a low voice she failed to hold steady.
"He will save Stewart. I have to tell you--I am Stewart's wife!"

She felt the stricken amaze that made these men silent and immovable. With level gaze averted
she left them. Returning to the house and her room, she prepared for something--for what? To wait!

Then a great invisible shadow seemed to hover behind her. She essayed many tasks, to fail of
attention, to find that her mind held only Stewart and his fortunes. Why had he become a Federal?
She reflected that he had won his title, El Capitan, fighting for Madero, the rebel. But Madero
was now a Federal, and Stewart was true to him. In crossing the border had Stewart any other
motive than the one he had implied to Madeline in his mocking smile and scornful words, "You
might have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble!" What trouble? She felt again the cold shock
of contact with the gun she had dropped in horror. He meant the trouble of getting himself
shot in the only way a man could seek death without cowardice. But had he any other motive?
She recalled Don Carlos and his guerrillas. Then the thought leaped up in her mind with gripping
power that Stewart meant to hunt Don Carlos, to meet him, to kill him. It would be the deed
of a silent, vengeful, implacable man driven by wild justice such as had been the deadly leaven
in Monty Price. It was a deed to expect of Nels or Nick Steel--and, aye, of Gene Stewart. Madeline
felt regret that Stewart, as he had climbed so high, had not risen above deliberate seeking
to kill his enemy, however evil that enemy.

The local newspapers, which came regularly a day late from El Paso and Douglas, had never won
any particular interest from Madeline; now, however, she took up any copies she could find
and read all the information pertaining to the revolution. Every word seemed vital to her,
of moving significant force.

AMERICANS ROBBED BY MEXICAN REBELS

MADERA, STATE OF CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO, July 17.--Having looted the Madera Lumber Company's storehouses
of $25,000 worth of goods and robbed scores of foreigners of horses and saddles, the rebel
command of Gen. Antonio Rojas, comprising a thousand men, started westward to-day through the
state of Sonora for Agnaymas and Pacific coast points.

The troops are headed for Dolores, where a mountain pass leads into the state of Sonora. Their
entrance will be opposed by 1,000 Maderista volunteers, who are reported to be waiting the
rebel invasion.

The railroad south of Madera is being destroyed and many Americans who were traveling to Chihuahua
from Juarez are marooned here.

General Rojas executed five men while here for alleged offenses of a trivial character. Gen.
Rosalio y Hernandez, Lieut. Cipriano Amador, and three soldiers were the unfortunates.

WASHINGTON, July 17.--Somewhere in Mexico Patrick Dunne, an American citizen, is in prison
under sentence of death. This much and no more the State Department learned through Representative
Kinkaid of Nebraska. Consular officers in various sections of Mexico have been directed to
make every effort to locate Dunne and save his life.

JUAREZ, MEXICO, July 31.--General Orozco, chief of the rebels, declared to-day:

"If the United States will throw down the barriers and let us have all the ammunition we can
buy, I promise in sixty days to have peace restored in Mexico and a stable government in charge."

CASAS GRANDES, CHIHUAHUA, July 31.--Rebel soldiers looted many homes of Mormons near here yesterday.
All the Mormon families have fled to El Paso. Although General Salazar had two of his soldiers
executed yesterday for robbing Mormons, he has not made any attempt to stop his men looting
the unprotected homes of Americans.

Last night's and to-day's trains carried many Americans from Pearson, Madera, and other localities
outside the Mormon settlements. Refugees from Mexico continued to pour into El Paso. About
one hundred came last night, the majority of whom were men. Heretofore few men came.

Madeline read on in feverish absorption. It was not a real war, but a starving, robbing, burning,
hopeless revolution. Five men executed for alleged offenses of a trivial nature! What chance
had, then, a Federal prisoner, an enemy to be feared, an American cowboy in the clutches of
those crazed rebels?

Madeline endured patiently, endured for long interminable hours while holding to her hope with
indomitable will.

No message came. At sunset she went outdoors, suffering a torment of accumulating suspense.
She faced the desert, hoping, praying for strength. The desert did not influence her as did
the passionless, unchangeable stars that had soothed her spirit. It was red, mutable, shrouded
in shadows, terrible like her mood. A dust-veiled sunset colored the vast, brooding, naked
waste of rock and sand. The grim Chiricahua frowned black and sinister. The dim blue domes
of the Guadalupes seemed to whisper, to beckon to her. Beyond them somewhere was Stewart, awaiting
the end of a few brief hours--hours that to her were boundless, endless, insupportable.

Night fell. But now the white, pitiless stars failed her. Then she sought the seclusion and
darkness of her room, there to lie with wide eyes, waiting, waiting. She had always been susceptible
to the somber, mystic unrealities of the night, and now her mind slowly revolved round a vague
and monstrous gloom. Nevertheless, she was acutely sensitive to outside impressions. She heard
the measured tread of a guard, the rustle of wind stirring the window-curtain, the remote,
mournful wail of a coyote. By and by the dead silence of the night insulated her with leaden
oppression. There was silent darkness for so long that when the window casements showed gray
she believed it was only fancy and that dawn would never come. She prayed for the sun not to
rise, not to begin its short twelve-hour journey toward what might be a fatal setting for Stewart.
But the dawn did lighten, swiftly she thought, remorselessly. Daylight had broken, and this
was Thursday!

Sharp ringing of the telephone bell startled her, roused her into action. She ran to answer
the call.

"Hello--hello--Miss Majesty!" came the hurried reply. "This is Link talkin'. Messages for you.
Favorable, the operator said. I'm to ride out with them. I'll come a-hummin'."

That was all. Madeline heard the bang of the receiver as Stevens threw it down. She passionately
wanted to know more, but was immeasurably grateful for so much! Favorable! Then Stillwell had
been successful. Her heart leaped. Suddenly she became weak and her hands failed of their accustomed
morning deftness. It took her what seemed a thousand years to dress. Breakfast meant nothing
to her except that it helped her to pass dragging minutes.

Finally a low hum, mounting swiftly to a roar and ending with a sharp report, announced the
arrival of the car. If her feet had kept pace with her heart she would have raced out to meet
Link. She saw him, helmet thrown back, watch in hand, and he looked up at her with his cool,
bright smile, with his familiar apologetic manner.

"Fifty-three minutes, Miss Majesty," he said, "but I hed to ride round a herd of steers an'
bump a couple off the trail."

He gave her a packet of telegrams. Madeline tore them open with shaking fingers, began to read
with swift, dim eyes. Some were from Washington, assuring her of every possible service; some
were from New York; others written in Spanish were from El Paso, and these she could not wholly
translate in a brief glance. Would she never find Stillwell's message? It was the last. It
was lengthy. It read:

Bought Stewart's release. Also arranged for his transfer as prisoner of war. Both matters official.
He's safe if we can get notice to his captors. Not sure I've reached them by wire. Afraid to
trust it. You go with Link to Agua Prieta. Take the messages sent you in Spanish. They will
protect you and secure Stewart's freedom. Take Nels with you. Stop for nothing. Tell Link all--trust
him--let him drive that car.

STILLWELL.

          *****

The first few lines of Stillwell's message lifted Madeline to the heights of thanksgiving and
happiness. Then, reading on, she experienced a check, a numb, icy, sickening pang. At the last
line she flung off doubt and dread, and in white, cold passion faced the issue.

"Read," she said, briefly, handing the telegram to Link. He scanned it and then looked blankly
up at her.

"Link, do you know the roads, the trails--the desert between here and Agua Prieta?" she asked.

"Thet's sure my old stampin'-ground. An' I know Sonora, too."

"We must reach Agua Prieta before sunset--long before, so if Stewart is in some near-by camp
we can get to it in--in time."

"Miss Majesty, it ain't possible!" he exclaimed. "Stillwell's crazy to say thet."

"Link, can an automobile be driven from here into northern Mexico?"

"Sure. But it 'd take time."

"We must do it in little time," she went on, in swift eagerness. "Otherwise Stewart may be--probably
will be--be shot."

Link Stevens appeared suddenly to grow lax, shriveled, to lose all his peculiar pert brightness,
to weaken and age.

"I'm only a--a cowboy, Miss Majesty." He almost faltered. It was a singular change in him.
"Thet's an awful ride--down over the border. If by some luck I didn't smash the car I'd turn
your hair gray. You'd never be no good after thet ride!"

"I am Stewart's wife," she answered him and she looked at him, not conscious of any motive
to persuade or allure, but just to let him know the greatness of her dependence upon him.

He started violently--the old action of Stewart, the memorable action of Monty Price. This
man was of the same wild breed.

Then Madeline's words flowed in a torrent. "I am Stewart's wife. I love him; I have been unjust
to him; I must save him. Link, I have faith in you. I beseech you to do your best for Stewart's
sake--for my sake. I'll risk the ride gladly--bravely. I'll not care where or how you drive.
I'd far rather plunge into a canyon--go to my death on the rocks--than not try to save Stewart."

How beautiful the response of this rude cowboy--to realize his absolute unconsciousness of
self, to see the haggard shade burn out of his face, the old, cool, devil-may-care spirit return
to his eyes, and to feel something wonderful about him then! It was more than will or daring
or sacrifice. A blood-tie might have existed between him and Madeline. She sensed again that
indefinable brother-like quality, so fine, so almost invisible, which seemed to be an inalienable
trait in these wild cowboys.

"Miss Majesty, thet ride figgers impossible, but I'll do it!" he replied. His cool, bright
glance thrilled her. "I'll need mebbe half an hour to go over the car an' to pack on what I'll
want."

She could not thank him, and her reply was merely a request that he tell Nels and other cowboys
off duty to come up to the house. When Link had gone Madeline gave a moment's thought to preparations
for the ride. She placed what money she had and the telegrams in a satchel. The gown she had
on was thin and white, not suitable for travel, but she would not risk the losing of one moment
in changing it. She put on a long coat and wound veils round her head and neck, arranging them
in a hood so she could cover her face when necessary. She remembered to take an extra pair
of goggles for Nels's use, and then, drawing on her gloves, she went out ready for the ride.

A number of cowboys were waiting. She explained the situation and left them in charge of her
home. With that she asked Nels to accompany her down into the desert. He turned white to his
lips, and this occasioned Madeline to remember his mortal dread of the car and Link's driving.

"Nels, I'm sorry to ask you," she added. "I know you hate the car. But I need you--may need
you, oh! so much."

"Why, Miss Majesty, thet's shore all a mistaken idee of yours about me hatin' the car," he
said, in his slow, soft drawl. "I was only jealous of Link; an' the boys, they made thet joke
up on me about bein' scared of ridin' fast. Shore I'm powerful proud to go. An' I reckon if
you hedn't asked me my feelin's might hev been some hurt. Because if you're goin' down among
the Greasers you want me."

His cool, easy speech, his familiar swagger, the smile with which he regarded her did not in
the least deceive Madeline. The gray was still in his face. Incomprehensible as it seemed,
Nels had a dread, an uncanny fear, and it was of that huge white automobile. But he lied about
it. Here again was that strange quality of faithfulness.

Madeline heard the buzz of the car. Link appeared driving up the slope. He made a short, sliding
turn and stopped before the porch. Link had tied two long, heavy planks upon the car, one on
each side, and in every available space he had strapped extra tires. A huge cask occupied one
back seat, and another seat was full of tools and ropes. There was just room in this rear part
of the car for Nels to squeeze in. Link put Madeline in front beside him, then bent over the
wheel. Madeline waved her hand at the silent cowboys on the porch. Not an audible good-by was
spoken.

The car glided out of the yard, leaped from level to slope, and started swiftly down the road,
out into the open valley. Each stronger rush of dry wind in Madeline's face marked the increase
of speed. She took one glance at the winding cattle-road, smooth, unobstructed, disappearing
in the gray of distance. She took another at the leather-garbed, leather-helmeted driver beside
her, and then she drew the hood of veils over her face and fastened it round her neck so there
was no possibility of its blowing loose.

Harder and stronger pressed the wind till it was like sheeted lead forcing her back in her
seat. There was a ceaseless, intense, inconceivably rapid vibration under her; occasionally
she felt a long swing, as if she were to be propelled aloft; but no jars disturbed the easy
celerity of the car. The buzz, the roar of wheels, of heavy body in flight, increased to a
continuous droning hum. The wind became an insupportable body moving toward her, crushing her
breast, making the task of breathing most difficult. To Madeline the time seemed to fly with
the speed of miles. A moment came when she detected a faint difference in hum and rush and
vibration, in the ceaseless sweeping of the invisible weight against her. This difference became
marked. Link was reducing speed. Then came swift change of all sensation, and she realized
the car had slowed to normal travel.

Madeline removed her hood and goggles. It was a relief to breathe freely, to be able to use
her eyes. To her right, not far distant, lay the little town of Chiricahua. Sight of it made
her remember Stewart in a way strange to her constant thought of him. To the left inclined
the gray valley. The red desert was hidden from view, but the Guadalupe Mountains loomed close
in the southwest.

Opposite Chiricahua, where the road forked, Link Stevens headed the car straight south and
gradually increased speed. Madeline faced another endless gray incline. It was the San Bernardino
Valley. The singing of the car, the stinging of the wind warned her to draw the hood securely
down over her face again, and then it was as if she was riding at night. The car lurched ahead,
settled into that driving speed which wedged Madeline back as in a vise. Again the moments
went by fleet as the miles. Seemingly, there was an acceleration of the car till it reached
a certain swiftness--a period of time in which it held that pace, and then a diminishing of
all motion and sound which contributed to Madeline's acute sensation. Uncovering her face,
she saw Link was passing another village. Could it be Bernardino? She asked Link--repeated
the question.

"Sure," he replied. "Eighty miles."

Link did not this time apologize for the work of his machine. Madeline marked the omission
with her first thrill of the ride. Leaning over, she glanced at Link's watch, which he had
fastened upon the wheel in front of his eyes. A quarter to ten! Link had indeed made short
work of the valley miles.

Beyond Bernardino Link sheered off the road and put the car to a long, low-rising slope. Here
the valley appeared to run south under the dark brows of the Guadalupes. Link was heading southwest.
Madeline observed that the grass began to fail as they climbed the ridge; bare, white, dusty
spots appeared; there were patches of mesquite and cactus and scattering areas of broken rock.

She might have been prepared for what she saw from the ridge-top. Beneath them the desert blazed.
Seen from afar, it was striking enough, but riding down into its red jaws gave Madeline the
first affront to her imperious confidence. All about her ranch had been desert, the valleys
were desert; but this was different. Here began the red desert, extending far into Mexico,
far across Arizona and California to the Pacific. She saw a bare, hummocky ridge, down which
the car was gliding, bounding, swinging, and this long slant seemed to merge into a corrugated
world of rock and sand, patched by flats and basins, streaked with canyons and ranges of ragged,
saw-toothed stone. The distant Sierra Madres were clearer, bluer, less smoky and suggestive
of mirage than she had ever seen them. Madeline's sustaining faith upheld her in the face of
this appalling obstacle. Then the desert that had rolled its immensity beneath her gradually
began to rise, to lose its distant margins, to condense its varying lights and shades, at last
to hide its yawning depths and looming heights behind red ridges, which were only little steps,
little outposts, little landmarks at its gates.

Forward as it can not steadily it should be really he must then to encounter she out for planks
of the was seemingly was the link.
 She was all in a strange glow, she had begun to burn, to throb, to thrill, to expand,
and she meant to see all that was possible. The sullen sun, red as fire, hung over the mountain
range in the west. How low it had sunk! Before her stretched a narrow, white road, dusty, hard
as stone--a highway that had been used for centuries. If it had been wide enough to permit
passing a vehicle it would have been a magnificent course for automobiles. But the weeds and
the dusty flowers and the mesquite boughs and arms of cactus brushed the car as it sped by.

Faster, faster, faster! That old resistless weight began to press Madeline back; the old incessant
bellow of wind filled her ears. Link Stevens hunched low over the wheel. His eyes were hidden
under leather helmet and goggles, but the lower part of his face was unprotected. He resembled
a demon, so dark and stone-hard and strangely grinning was he. All at once Madeline realized
how matchless, how wonderful a driver was this cowboy. She divined that weakening could not
have been possible to Link Stevens. He was a cowboy, and he really was riding that car, making
it answer to his will, as it had been born in him to master a horse. He had never driven to
suit himself, had never reached an all-satisfying speed until now. Beyond that his motive was
to save Stewart--to make Madeline happy. Life was nothing to him. That fact gave him the superhuman
nerve to face the peril of this ride. Because of his disregard of self he was able to operate
the machine, to choose the power, the speed, the guidance, the going with the best judgment
and highest efficiency possible. Madeline knew he would get her to Mezquital in time to save
Stewart or he would kill her in the attempt.

The white, narrow road flashed out of the foreground, slipped with inconceivable rapidity under
the car. When she marked a clump of cactus far ahead it seemed to shoot at her, to speed behind
her even the instant she noticed it. Nevertheless, Madeline knew Link was not putting the car
to its limit. Swiftly as he was flying, he held something in reserve. But he took the turns
of the road as if he knew the way was cleared before him. He trusted to a cowboy's luck. A
wagon in one of those curves, a herd of cattle, even a frightened steer, meant a wreck. Madeline
never closed her eyes at these fateful moments. If Link could stake himself, the others, and
her upon such chance, what could not she stake with her motive? So while the great car hummed
and thrummed, and darted round the curves on two wheels, and sped on like a bullet, Madeline
lived that ride, meant to feel it to the uttermost.

But it was not all swift going. A stretch of softer ground delayed Link, made the car labor
and pant and pound and grind through gravel. Moreover, the cactus plants assumed an alarming
ability to impede progress. Long, slender arms of the ocotillo encroached upon the road; broad,
round leaves did likewise; fluted columns, fallen like timbers in a forest, lay along the narrow
margins; the bayonet cactus and the bisnagi leaned threateningly; clusters of maguey, shadowed
by the huge, looming saguaro, infringed upon the highway to Mezquital. And every leaf and blade
and branch of cactus bore wicked thorns, any one of which would be fatal to a tire.

It came at length, the bursting report. The car lurched, went on like a crippled thing, and
halted, obedient to the master hand at the wheel. Swift as Link was in replacing the tire,
he lost time. The red sun, more sullen, duskier as it neared the black, bold horizon, appeared
to mock Madeline, to eye her in derision.

Link leaped in, and the car sprang ahead. The road-bed changed, the trees changed--all the
surroundings changed except the cactus. There were miles of rolling ridges, rough in the hollows,
and short rocky bits of road, and washes to cross, and a low, sandy swale where mesquites grouped
a forest along a trickling inch-deep sheet of water. Green things softened the hard, dry aspect
of the desert. There were birds and parrots and deer and wild boars. All these Madeline remarked
with clear eyes, with remarkable susceptibility of attention; but what she strained to see,
what she yearned for, prayed for, was straight, unobstructed road.

But the road began to wind up; it turned and twisted in tantalizing lazy curves; it was in
no hurry to surmount a hill that began to assume proportions of a mountain; it was leisurely,
as were all things in Mexico except strife. That was quick, fierce, bloody--it was Spanish.

The descent from that elevation was difficult, extremely hazardous, yet Link Stevens drove
fast. At the base of the hill rocks and sand all but halted him for good. Then in taking an
abrupt curve a grasping spear ruined another tire. This time the car rasped across the road
into the cactus, bursting the second front-wheel tire. Like demons indeed Link and Nels worked.
Shuddering, Madeline felt the declining heat of the sun, saw with gloomy eyes the shading of
the red light over the desert. She did not look back to see how near the sun was to the horizon.
She wanted to ask Nels. Strange as anything on this terrible ride was the absence of speech.
As yet no word had been spoken. Madeline wanted to shriek to Link to hurry. But he was more
than humanly swift in all his actions. So with mute lips, with the fire in her beginning to
chill, with a lifelessness menacing her spirit, she watched, hoped against hope, prayed for
a long, straight, smooth road.

Quite suddenly she saw it, seemingly miles of clear, narrow lane disappearing like a thin,
white streak in distant green. Perhaps Link Stevens's heart leaped like Madeline's. The huge
car with a roar and a jerk seemed to answer Madeline's call, a cry no less poignant because
it was silent.

Faster, faster, faster! The roar became a whining hum. Then for Madeline sound ceased to be
anything--she could not hear. The wind was now heavy, imponderable, no longer a swift, plastic
thing, but solid, like an on-rushing wall. It bore down upon Madeline with such resistless
weight that she could not move. The green of desert plants along the road merged in two shapeless
fences, sliding at her from the distance. Objects ahead began to blur the white road, to grow
streaky, like rays of light, the sky to take on more of a reddening haze.

Madeline, realizing her sight was failing her, turned for one more look at Link Stevens. It
had come to be his ride almost as much as it was hers. He hunched lower than ever, rigid, strained
to the last degree, a terrible, implacable driver. This was his hour, and he was great. If
he so much as brushed a flying tire against one of the millions of spikes clutching out, striking
out from the cactus, there would be a shock, a splitting wave of air--an end. Madeline thought
she saw that Link's bulging cheek and jaw were gray, that his tight-shut lips were white, that
the smile was gone. Then he really was human--not a demon. She felt a strange sense of brotherhood.
He understood a woman's soul as Monty Price had understood it. Link was the lightning-forged
automaton, the driving, relentless, unconquerable instrument of a woman's will. He was a man
whose force was directed by a woman's passion. He reached up to her height, felt her love,
understood the nature of her agony. These made him heroic. But it was the hard life, the wild
years of danger on the desert, the companionship of ruthless men, the elemental, that made
possible his physical achievement. Madeline loved his spirit then and gloried in the man.

She had pictured upon her heart, never to be forgotten, this little hunched, deformed figure
of Link's hanging with dauntless, with deathless grip over the wheel, his gray face like a
marble mask.

That was Madeline's last clear sensation upon the ride. Blinded, dazed, she succumbed to the
demands upon her strength. She reeled, fell back, only vaguely aware of a helping hand. Confusion
seized her senses. All about her was a dark chaos through which she was rushing, rushing, rushing
under the wrathful red eye of a setting sun. Then, as there was no more sound or sight for
her, she felt there was no color. But the rush never slackened--a rush through opaque, limitless
space. For moments, hours, ages she was propelled with the velocity of a shooting-star. The
earth seemed a huge automobile. And it sped with her down an endless white track through the
universe. Looming, ghostly, ghastly, spectral forms of cacti plants, large as pine-trees, stabbed
her with giant spikes. She became an unstable being in a shapeless, colorless, soundless cosmos
of unrelated things, but always rushing, even to meet the darkness that haunted her and never
reached her.

But at an end of infinite time that rush ceased. Madeline lost the queer feeling of being disembodied
by a frightfully swift careening through boundless distance. She distinguished voices, low
at first, apparently far away. Then she opened her eyes to blurred but conscious sight.

The car had come to a stop. Link was lying face down over the wheel. Nels was rubbing her hands,
calling to her. She saw a house with clean whitewashed wall and brown-tiled roof. Beyond, over
a dark mountain range, peeped the last red curve, the last beautiful ray of the setting sun.

XXV. At the End of the Road

Madeline saw that the car was surrounded by armed Mexicans. They presented a contrast to the
others she had seen that day; she wondered a little at their silence, at their respectful front.

Suddenly a sharp spoken order opened up the ranks next to the house. Senor Montes appeared
in the break, coming swiftly. His dark face wore a smile; his manner was courteous, important,
authoritative.

"Senora, it is not too late!"

He spoke her language with an accent strange to her, so that it seemed to hinder understanding.

"Senora, you got here in time," he went on. "El Capitan Stewart will be free."

"Free!" she whispered.

She rose, reeling.

"Come," replied Montes, taking her arm. "Perdoneme, Senora."

Without his assistance she would have fallen wholly upon Nels, who supported her on the other
side. They helped her alight from the car. For a moment the white walls, the hazy red sky,
the dark figures of the rebels, whirled before Madeline's eyes. She took a few steps, swaying
between her escorts; then the confusion of her sight and mind passed away. It was as if she
quickened with a thousand vivifying currents, as if she could see and hear and feel everything
in the world, as if nothing could be overlooked, forgotten, neglected.

She turned back, remembering Link. He was lurching from the car, helmet and goggles thrust
back, the gray shade gone from his face, the cool, bright gleam of his eyes disappearing for
something warmer.

Senor Montes led Madeline and her cowboys through a hall to a patio, and on through a large
room with flooring of rough, bare boards that rattled, into a smaller room full of armed quiet
rebels facing an open window.

Madeline scanned the faces of these men, expecting to see Don Carlos. But he was not present.
A soldier addressed her in Spanish too swiftly uttered, too voluble for her to translate. But,
like Senor Montes, he was gracious and, despite his ragged garb and uncouth appearance, he
bore the unmistakable stamp of authority.

Montes directed Madeline's attention to a man by the window. A loose scarf of vivid red hung
from his hand.

"Senora, they were waiting for the sun to set when we arrived," said Montes. "The signal was
about to be given for Senor Stewart's walk to death."

"Stewart's walk!" echoed Madeline.

"Ah, Senora, let me tell you his sentence--the sentence I have had the honor and happiness
to revoke for you."

Stewart had been court-martialed and sentenced according to a Mexican custom observed in cases
of brave soldiers to whom honorable and fitting executions were due. His hour had been set
for Thursday when the sun had sunk. Upon signal he was to be liberated and was free to walk
out into the road, to take any direction he pleased. He knew his sentence; knew that death
awaited him, that every possible avenue of escape was blocked by men with rifles ready. But
he had not the slightest idea at what moment or from what direction the bullets were to come.

"Senora, we have sent messengers to every squad of waiting soldiers--an order that El Capitan
is not to be shot. He is ignorant of his release. I shall give the signal for his freedom."

Montes was ceremonious, gallant, emotional. Madeline saw his pride, and divined that the situation
was one which brought out the vanity, the ostentation, as well as the cruelty of his race.
He would keep her in an agony of suspense, let Stewart start upon that terrible walk in ignorance
of his freedom. It was the motive of a Spaniard. Suddenly Madeline had a horrible quaking fear
that Montes lied, that he meant her to be a witness of Stewart's execution. But no, the man
was honest; he was only barbarous. He would satisfy certain instincts of his nature--sentiment,
romance, cruelty--by starting Stewart upon that walk, by watching Stewart's actions in the
face of seeming death, by seeing Madeline's agony of doubt, fear, pity, love. Almost Madeline
felt that she could not endure the situation. She was weak and tottering.

"Senora! Ah, it will be one beautiful thing!" Montes caught the scarf from the rebel's hand.
He was glowing, passionate; his eyes had a strange, soft, cold flash; his voice was low, intense.
He was living something splendid to him. "I'll wave the scarf, Senora. That will be the signal.
It will be seen down at the other end of the road. Senor Stewart's jailer will see the signal,
take off Stewart's irons, release him, open the door for his walk. Stewart will be free. But
he will not know. He will expect death. As he is a brave man, he will face it. He will walk
this way. Every step of that walk he will expect to be shot from some unknown quarter. Her was

.
 Every step Stewart took thrilled her. She had some strange, subtle intuition that he
was not unhappy, and that he believed beyond shadow of doubt that he was walking to his death.
His steps dragged a little, though they had begun to be swift. The old, hard, physical, wild
nerve of the cowboy was perhaps in conflict with spiritual growth of the finer man, realizing
too late that life ought not to be sacrificed.

Then the dark gleam that was his face took shape, grew sharper and clearer. He was stalking
now, and there was a suggestion of impatience in his stride. It took these hidden Mexicans
a long time to kill him! At a point in the middle of the road, even with the corner of a house
and opposite to Madeline's position, Stewart halted stock-still. He presented a fair, bold
mark to his executioners, and he stood there motionless a full moment.

Only silence greeted him. Plain it was to Madeline, and she thought to all who had eyes to
see, that to Stewart, since for some reason he had been spared all along his walk, this was
the moment when he ought to be mercifully shot. But as no shots came a rugged dignity left
him for a reckless scorn manifest in the way he strolled, across to the corner of the house,
rolled yet another cigarette, and, presenting a broad breast to the window, smoked and waited.

That wait was almost unendurable for Madeline. Perhaps it was only a moment, several moments
at the longest, but the time seemed a year. Stewart's face was scornful, hard. Did he suspect
treachery on the part of his captors, that they meant to play with him as a cat with a mouse,
to murder him at leisure? Do they is the much sceptic; as his is the agnosticism, do not for
beauty, but something of feeling, whose certainty in himself. Wistfully as he could be, that no
west in something always they would. In him it is too passive friends, as the malady and
rather than the mind.

It might perhaps to call him small: not if he was in resentment and would give something to a
smoothie, but merely that he would never was and would even could be in earnest something. She breaks
down bridges to him, not behind him, as a action would do; but there is something more as a. Perhaps
if he was only think in himself, that were better than nothing; for it would once to get a way successes
to life, nay, it will even sometimes come him resolved the world.

The next instant he was striding forward, to force by bold and scornful presence a speedy fulfilment
of his sentence.

Madeline stepped into the door, crossed the threshold. Stewart staggered as if indeed the bullets
he expected had pierced him in mortal wound. His dark face turned white. His eyes had the rapt
stare, the wild fear of a man who saw an apparition, yet who doubted his sight. Perhaps he
had called to her as the Mexicans called to their Virgin; perhaps he imagined sudden death
had come unawares, and this was her image appearing to him in some other life.

"Who--are--you?" he whispered, hoarsely.

She tried to lift her hands, failed, tried again, and held them out, trembling.

"It is I. Majesty. Your wife!"
