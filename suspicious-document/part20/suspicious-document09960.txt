 But on this occasion he walked
down to the river side, and then walked from the Mansion House into a dingy little court called
Little Tankard Yard, near the Bank of England, and going through a narrow dark long passage
got into a little office at the back of a building, in which there sat at a desk a greasy gentleman
with a new hat on one side of his head, who might perhaps be about forty years old. The place
was very dark, and the man was turning over the leaves of a ledger. A stranger to city ways
might probably have said that he was idle, but he was no doubt filling his mind with that erudition
which would enable him to earn his bread. On the other side of the desk there was a little
boy copying letters. These were Mr. Sextus Parker,--commonly called Sexty Parker,--and his
clerk. Mr. Parker was a gentleman very well known and at the present moment favourably esteemed
on the Stock Exchange. "What, Lopez!" said he. "Uncommon glad to see you. What can I do for you?"

"Just come inside,--will you?" said Lopez. Now within Mr. Parker's very small office there
was a smaller office in which there were a safe, a small rickety Pembroke table, two chairs,
and an old washing-stand with a tumbled towel. Lopez led the way into this sanctum as though
he knew the place well, and Sexty Parker followed him.

"Beastly day, isn't it?" said Sexty.

"Yes,--a nasty east wind."

"Cutting one in two, with a hot sun at the same time. One ought to hybernate at this time of
the year."

"Then why don't you hybernate?" said Lopez.

"Business is too good. That's about it. A man has to stick to it when it does come. Everybody
can't do like you;--give up regular work, and make a better thing of an hour now and an hour
then, just as it pleases you. I shouldn't dare go in for that kind of thing."

"I don't suppose you or any one else know what I go in for," said Lopez, with a look that indicated
offence.

"Nor don't care," said Sexty;--"only hope it's something good for your sake." Sexty Parker
had known Mr. Lopez well, now for some years, and being an overbearing man himself,--somewhat
even of a bully if the truth be spoken,--and by no means apt to give way unless hard pressed,
had often tried his "hand" on his friend, as he himself would have said. But I doubt whether
he could remember any instance in which he could congratulate himself on success. He was trying
his hand again now, but did it with a faltering voice, having caught a glance of his friend's eye.

"I dare say not," said Lopez. Then he continued without changing his voice or the nature of
the glance of his eye, "I'll tell you what I want you to do now. I want your name to this bill
for three months."

Sexty Parker opened his mouth and his eyes, and took the bit of paper that was tendered to
him. It was a promissory note for £750, which, if signed by him, would at the end of the specified
period make him liable for that sum were it not otherwise paid. His friend Mr. Lopez was indeed
applying to him for the assistance of his name in raising a loan to the amount of the sum named.
This was a kind of favour which a man should ask almost on his knees,--and which, if so asked,
Mr. Sextus Parker would certainly refuse. And here was Ferdinand Lopez asking it,--whom Sextus
Parker had latterly regarded as an opulent man,--and asking it not at all on his knees, but,
as one might say, at the muzzle of a pistol. "Accommodation bill!" said Sexty. "Why, you ain't
hard up; are you?"

"I'm not going just at present to tell you much about my affairs, and yet I expect you to do
what I ask you. I don't suppose you doubt my ability to raise £750."

"Oh, dear, no," said Sexty, who had been looked at and who had not borne the inspection well.

"And I don't suppose you would refuse me even if I were hard up, as you call it." There had
been affairs before between the two men in which Lopez had probably been the stronger, and
the memory of them, added to the inspection which was still going on, was heavy upon poor Sexty.

"Oh, dear, no;--I wasn't thinking of refusing. I suppose a fellow may be a little surprised
at such a thing."

"I don't know why you need be surprised, as such things are very common. I happen to have taken
a share in a loan a little beyond my immediate means, and therefore want a few hundreds. There
is no one I can ask with a better grace than you. If you ain't--afraid about it, just sign it."

"Oh, I ain't afraid," said Sexty, taking his pen and writing his name across the bill. But
even before the signature was finished, when his eye was taken away from the face of his companion
and fixed upon the disagreeable piece of paper beneath his hand, he repented of what he was
doing. He almost arrested his signature half-way. He did hesitate, but had not pluck enough
to stop his hand. "It does seem to be a d----d odd transaction all the same," he said as he
leaned back in his chair.

"It's the commonest thing in the world," said Lopez picking up the bill in a leisurely way,
folding it and putting it into his pocket-book. "Have our names never been together on a bit
of paper before?"

"When we both had something to make by it."

"You've nothing to make and nothing to lose by this. Good day and many thanks;--though I don't
think so much of the affair as you seem to do." Then Ferdinand Lopez took his departure and
Sexty Parker was left alone in his bewilderment.

"By George,--that's queer," he said to himself. "Who'd have thought of Lopez being hard up
for a few hundred pounds? But it must be all right. He wouldn't have come in that fashion,
if it hadn't been all right. I oughtn't to have done it though! A man ought never to do that
kind of thing;--never,--never!" And Mr. Sextus Parker was much discontented with himself, so
that when he got home that evening to the wife of his bosom and his little family at Ponders
End, he by no means made himself agreeable to them. For that sum of £750 sat upon his bosom
as he ate his supper, and lay upon his chest as he slept,--like a nightmare.

CHAPTER II

Everett Wharton

On that same day Lopez dined with his friend Everett Wharton at a new club called the Progress,
of which they were both members. The Progress was certainly a new club, having as yet been
open hardly more than three years; but still it was old enough to have seen many of the hopes
of its early youth become dim with age and inaction. For the Progress had intended to do great
things for the Liberal party,--or rather for political liberality in general,--and had in truth
done little or nothing. It had been got up with considerable enthusiasm, and for a while certain
fiery politicians had believed that through the instrumentality of this institution men of
genius, and spirit, and natural power, but without wealth,--meaning always themselves,--would
be supplied with sure seats in Parliament and a probable share in the Government. But no such
results had been achieved. There had been a want of something,--some deficiency felt but not
yet defined,--which had hitherto been fatal. The young men said it was because no old stager
who knew the way of pulling the wires would come forward and put the club in the proper groove.
The old men said it was because the young men were pretentious puppies. It was, however, not
to be doubted that the party of Progress had become slack, and that the Liberal politicians
of the country, although a special new club had been opened for the furtherance of their views,
were not at present making much way. "What we want is organization," said one of the leading
young men. But the organization was not as yet forthcoming.

The club, nevertheless, went on its way, like other clubs, and men dined and smoked and played
billiards and pretended to read. Some few energetic members still hoped that a good day would
come in which their grand ideas might be realised,--but as regarded the members generally,
they were content to eat and drink and play billiards. It was a fairly good club,--with a sprinkling
of Liberal lordlings, a couple of dozen of members of Parliament who had been made to believe
that they would neglect their party duties unless they paid their money, and the usual assortment
of barristers, attorneys, city merchants and idle men. It was good enough at any rate for Ferdinand
Lopez, who was particular about his dinner, and had an opinion of his own about wines. He had
been heard to assert that, for real quiet comfort, there was not a club in London equal to
it; but his hearers were not aware that in past days he had been blackballed at the T---- and
the G----. These were accidents which Lopez had a gift of keeping in the background. His present
companion, Everett Wharton, had, as well as himself, been an original member;--and Wharton
had been one of those who had hoped to find in the club a stepping-stone to high political
life, and who now talked often with idle energy of the need of organization.

"For myself," said Lopez, "I can conceive no vainer object of ambition than a seat in the British
Parliament. What does any man gain by it? The few who are successful work very hard for little
pay and no thanks,--or nearly equally hard for no pay and as little thanks. The many who fail
sit idly for hours, undergoing the weary task of listening to platitudes, and enjoy in return
the now absolutely valueless privilege of having M.P. written on their letters."

"Somebody must make laws for the country."

"I don't see the necessity. I think the country would do uncommonly well if it were to know
that no old law would be altered or new law made for the next twenty years."

"You wouldn't have repealed the corn laws?"

"There are no corn laws to repeal now."

"Nor modify the income tax?"

"I would modify nothing. But at any rate, whether laws are to be altered or to be left, it
is a comfort to me that I need not put my finger into that pie. There is one benefit indeed
in being in the House."

"You can't be arrested."

"Well;--that, as far as it goes; and one other. It assists a man in getting a seat as the director
of certain Companies. People are still such asses that they trust a Board of Directors made
up of members of Parliament, and therefore of course members are made welcome. But if you want
to get into the House why don't you arrange it with your father, instead of waiting for what
the club may do for you?"

"My father wouldn't pay a shilling for such a purpose. He was never in the House himself."

"And therefore despises it."

"A little of that, perhaps. No man ever worked harder than he did, or, in his way, more successfully;
and having seen one after another of his juniors become members of Parliament, while he stuck
to the attorneys, there is perhaps a little jealousy about it."

"From what I see of the way you live at home, I should think your father would do anything
for you,--with proper management. There is no doubt, I suppose, that he could afford it?"

"My father never in his life said anything to me about his own money affairs, though he says
a great deal about mine. No man ever was closer than my father. But I believe that he could
afford almost anything."

"I wish I had such a father," said Ferdinand Lopez. "I think that I should succeed in ascertaining
the extent of his capabilities, and in making some use of them too."

Wharton nearly asked his friend,--almost summoned courage to ask him,--whether his father had
done much for him. They were very intimate; and on one subject, in which Lopez was much interested,
their confidence had been very close. But the younger and the weaker man of the two could not
quite bring himself to the point of making an inquiry which he thought would be disagreeable.
Lopez had never before, in all their intercourse, hinted at the possibility of his having or
having had filial aspirations. He had been as though he had been created self-sufficient, independent
of mother's milk or father's money. Now the question might have been asked almost naturally.
But it was not asked.

Everett Wharton was a trouble to his father,--but not an agonizing trouble, as are some sons.
His faults were not of a nature to rob his father's cup of all its sweetness and to bring his
grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. Old Wharton had never had to ask himself whether he should
now, at length, let his son fall into the lowest abysses, or whether he should yet again struggle
to put him on his legs, again forgive him, again pay his debts, again endeavour to forget dishonour,
and place it all to the score of thoughtless youth. Had it been so, I think that, if not on
the first or second fall, certainly on the third, the young man would have gone into the abyss;
for Mr. Wharton was a stern man, and capable of coming to a clear conclusion on things that
were nearest and even dearest to himself. But Everett Wharton had simply shown himself to be
inefficient to earn his own bread. He had never declined even to do this,--but had simply been
inefficient. He had not declared either by words or actions that as his father was a rich man,
and as he was an only son, he would therefore do nothing. But he had tried his hand thrice,
and in each case, after but short trial, had assured his father and his friends that the thing
had not suited him. Leaving Oxford without a degree,--for the reading of the schools did not
suit him,--he had gone into a banking-house, by no means as a mere clerk, but with an expressed
proposition from his father, backed by the assent of a partner, that he should work his way
up to wealth and a great commercial position. But six months taught him that banking was "an
abomination," and he at once went into a course of reading with a barrister. He remained at
this till he was called,--for a man may be called with very little continuous work. But after
he was called the solitude of his chambers was too much for him, and at twenty-five he found
that the Stock Exchange was the mart in the world for such talents and energies as he possessed.
What was the nature of his failure during the year that he went into the city, was known only
to himself and his father,--unless Ferdinand Lopez knew something of it also. But at six-and-twenty
the Stock Exchange was also abandoned; and now, at eight-and-twenty, Everett Wharton had discovered
that a parliamentary career was that for which nature and his special genius had intended him.
He had probably suggested this to his father, and had met with some cold rebuff.

Everett Wharton was a good-looking, manly fellow, six feet high, with broad shoulders, with
light hair, wearing a large silky bushy beard, which made him look older than his years, who
neither by his speech nor by his appearance would ever be taken for a fool, but who showed
by the very actions of his body as well as by the play of his face, that he lacked firmness
of purpose. He certainly was no fool. He had read much, and, though he generally forgot what
he read, there were left with him from his readings certain nebulous lights, begotten by other
men's thinking, which enabled him to talk on most subjects. It cannot be said of him that he
did much thinking for himself;--but he thought that he thought. He believed of himself that
he had gone rather deep into politics, and that he was entitled to call many statesmen asses
because they did not see the things which he saw. He had the great question of labour, and
all that refers to unions, strikes, and lock-outs, quite at his fingers' ends. He knew how
the Church of England should be disestablished and recomposed. He was quite clear on questions
of finance, and saw to a "t" how progress should be made towards communism, so that no violence
should disturb that progress, and that in the due course of centuries all desire for personal
property should be conquered and annihilated by a philanthropy so general as hardly to be accounted
a virtue. In the meantime he could never contrive to pay his tailor's bill regularly out of
the allowance of £400 a year which his father made him, and was always dreaming of the comforts
of a handsome income.

He was a popular man certainly,--very popular with women, to whom he was always courteous,
and generally liked by men, to whom he was genial and good-natured. Though he was not himself
aware of the fact, he was very dear to his father, who in his own silent way almost admired
and certainly liked the openness and guileless freedom of a character which was very opposite
to his own. That fourth formula, than done-- dish, there would have been yielded fibres to happiness

"Men are too busy making money, my dear fellow."

"That's just it. Money's a very nice thing."

"Very nice," said Lopez.

"But the search after it is debasing. If a man could make money for four, or six, or even eight
hours a day, and then wash his mind of the pursuit, as a clerk in an office washes the copies
and ledgers out of his mind, then--"

"He would never make money in that way,--and keep it."

"And therefore the whole thing is debasing. A man ceases to care for the great interests of
the world, or even to be aware of their existence, when his whole soul is in Spanish bonds.
They wanted to make a banker of me, but I found that it would kill me."

"It would kill me, I think, if I had to confine myself to Spanish bonds."

"You know what I mean. You at any rate can understand me, though I fear you are too far gone
to abandon the idea of making a fortune."

"I would abandon it to-morrow if I could come into a fortune ready made. A man must at any
rate eat."

"Yes;--he must eat. But I am not quite sure," said Wharton thoughtfully, "that he need think
about what he eats."

"Unless the beef is sent up without horse radish!" It had happened that when the two men sat
down to their dinner the insufficient quantity of that vegetable supplied by the steward of
the club had been all consumed, and Wharton had complained of the grievance.

"A man has a right to that for which he has paid," said Wharton, with mock solemnity, "and
if he passes over laches of that nature without observation he does an injury to humanity at
large. I'm not going to be caught in a trap, you know, because I like horse radish with my
beef. Well, I can't go farther out of my way, as I have a deal of reading to do before I court
my Morpheus. If you'll take my advice you'll go straight to the governor. Whatever Emily may
feel I don't think she'll say much to encourage you unless you go about it after that fashion.
She has prim notions of her own, which perhaps are not after all so much amiss when a man wants
to marry a girl."

"God forbid that I should think that anything about your sister was amiss!"

"I don't think there is much myself. Women are generally superficial,--but some are honestly
superficial and some dishonestly. Emily at any rate is honest."

"Stop half a moment." Then they sauntered arm in arm down the broad pavement leading from Pall
Mall to the Duke of York's column. "I wish I could make out your father more clearly. He is
always civil to me, but he has a cold way of looking at me which makes me think I am not in
his good books."

"He is like that to everybody."

"I never seem to get beyond the skin with him. You must have heard him speak of me in my absence?"

"He never says very much about anybody."

"But a word would let me know how the land lies. You know me well enough to be aware that I
am the last man to be curious as to what others think of me. Indeed I do not care about it
as much as a man should do. I am utterly indifferent to the opinion of the world at large,
and would never object to the company of a pleasant person because the pleasant person abused
me behind my back. What I value is the pleasantness of the man and not his liking or disliking
for myself. But here the dearest aim of my life is concerned, and I might be guided either
this way or that, to my great advantage, by knowing whether I stand well or ill with him."

"You have dined three times within the last three months in Manchester Square, and I don't
know any other man,--certainly no other young man,--who has had such strong proof of intimacy
from my father."

"Yes, and I know my advantages. But I have been there as your friend, not as his."

"He doesn't care twopence about my friends. I wanted to give Charlie Skate a dinner, but my
father wouldn't have him at any price."

"Charlie Skate is out at elbows, and bets at billiards. I am respectable,--or at any rate your
father thinks so. Your father is more anxious about you than you are aware of, and wishes to
make his house pleasant to you as long as he can do so to your advantage. As far as you are
concerned he rather approves of me, fancying that my turn for making money is stronger than
my turn for spending it. Nevertheless, he looks upon me as a friend of yours rather than his
own. Though he has given me three dinners in three months,--and I own the greatness of his
hospitality,--I don't suppose he ever said a word in my favour. I wish I knew what he does say."

"He says he knows nothing about you."

"Oh;--that's it, is it? Then he can know no harm. When next he says so ask him of how many
of the men who dine at his house he can say as much. Good night;--I won't keep you any longer.
But I can tell you this;--if between us we can manage to handle him rightly, you may get your
seat in Parliament and I may get my wife;--that is, of course, if she will have me."

Then they parted, but Lopez remained in the pathway, walking up and down by the side of the
old military club, thinking of things. He certainly knew his friend, the younger Wharton, intimately,
appreciating the man's good qualities, and being fully aware of the man's weakness. By his
questions he had extracted quite enough to assure himself that Emily's father would be adverse
to his proposition. He had not felt much doubt before, but now he was certain. "He doesn't
know much about me," he said, musing to himself. "Well, no; he doesn't;--and there isn't very
much that I can tell him. Of course he's wise,--as wisdom goes. But then, wise men do do foolish
things at intervals. The discreetest of city bankers are talked out of their money; the most
scrupulous of matrons are talked out of their virtue; the most experienced of statesmen are
talked out of their principles. And who can really calculate chances? Men who lead forlorn
hopes generally push through without being wounded;--and the fifth or sixth heir comes to a
title." So much he said, palpably, though to himself, with his inner voice. Then,--impalpably,
with no even inner voice,--he asked himself what chance he might have of prevailing with the
girl herself; and he almost ventured to tell himself that in that direction he need not despair.

In very truth he loved the girl and reverenced her, believing her to be better and higher and
nobler than other human beings,--as a man does when he is in love; and so believing, he had
those doubts as to his own success which such reverence produces.

CHAPTER III

Mr. Abel Wharton, Q.C.

Lopez was not a man to let grass grow under his feet when he had anything to do. When he was
tired of walking backwards and forwards over the same bit of pavement, subject all the while
to a cold east wind, he went home and thought of the same matter while he lay in bed. Even
were he to get the girl's assurances of love, without the father's consent he might find himself
farther from his object than ever. Mr. Wharton was a man of old fashions, who would think himself
ill-used and his daughter ill-used, and who would think also that a general offence would have
been committed against good social manners, if his daughter were to be asked for her hand without
his previous consent. Should he absolutely refuse,--why then the battle, though it would be
a desperate battle, might perhaps be fought with other strategy; but, giving to the matter
his best consideration, Lopez thought it expedient to go at once to the father. In doing this
he would have no silly tremors. Whatever he might feel in speaking to the girl, he had sufficient
self-confidence to be able to ask the father, if not with assurance, at any rate without trepidation.
It was, he thought, probable that the father, at the first attack, would neither altogether
accede, or altogether refuse. The disposition of the man was averse to the probability of an
absolute reply at the first moment. The lover imagined that it might be possible for him to
take advantage of the period of doubt which would thus be created.

Mr. Wharton was and had for a great many years been a barrister practising in the Equity Courts,--or
rather in one Equity Court, for throughout a life's work now extending to nearly fifty years,
he had hardly ever gone out of the single Vice-Chancellor's Court which was much better known
by Mr. Wharton's name than by that of the less eminent judge who now sat there. His had been
a very peculiar, a very toilsome, but yet probably a very satisfactory life. He had begun his
practice early, and had worked in a stuff gown till he was nearly sixty. At that time he had
amassed a large fortune, mainly from his profession, but partly also by the careful use of
his own small patrimony and by his wife's money. Men knew that he was rich, but no one knew
the extent of his wealth. When he submitted to take a silk gown, he declared among his friends
that he did so as a step preparatory to his retirement. The altered method of work would not
suit him at his age, nor,--as he said,--would it be profitable. He would take his silk as an
honour for his declining years, so that he might become a bencher at his Inn. But he had now
been working for the last twelve or fourteen years with his silk gown,--almost as hard as in
younger days, and with pecuniary results almost as serviceable; and though from month to month
he declared his intention of taking no fresh briefs, and though he did now occasionally refuse
work, still he was there with his mind as clear as ever, and with his body apparently as little
affected by fatigue.

Mr. Wharton had not married till he was forty, and his wife had now been two years dead. He
had had six children,--of whom but two were now left to make a household for his old age. He
had been nearly fifty when his youngest daughter was born, and was therefore now an old father
of a young child. But he was one of those men who, as in youth they are never very young, so
in age are they never very old. He could still ride his cob in the park jauntily; and did so
carefully every morning in his life, after an early cup of tea and before his breakfast. And
he could walk home from his chambers every day, and on Sundays could do the round of the parks
on foot. Twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, he dined at that old law club, the Eldon,
and played whist after dinner till twelve o'clock. This was the great dissipation and, I think,
the chief charm of his life. In the middle of August he and his daughter usually went for a
month to Wharton Hall in Herefordshire, the seat of his cousin Sir Alured Wharton;--and this
was the one duty of his life which was a burthen to him. But he had been made to believe that
it was essential to his health, and to his wife's, and then to his girl's health, that he should
every summer leave town for a time,--and where else was he to go? Sir Alured was a relation
and a gentleman. Emily liked Wharton Hall. It was the proper thing. He hated Wharton Hall,
but then he did not know any place out of London that he would not hate worse. He had once
been induced to go up the Rhine, but had never repeated the experiment of foreign travel. Emily
sometimes went abroad with her cousins, during which periods it was supposed that the old lawyer
spent a good deal of his time at the Eldon. He was a spare, thin, strongly made man, with spare
light brown hair, hardly yet grizzled, with small grey whiskers, clear eyes, bushy eyebrows,
with a long ugly nose, on which young barristers had been heard to declare that you might hang
a small kettle, and with considerable vehemence of talk when he was opposed in argument. For,
with all his well-known coolness of temper, Mr. Wharton could become very hot in an argument,
when the nature of the case in hand required heat. On one subject all who knew him were agreed.
He was a thorough lawyer. Many doubted his eloquence, and some declared that he had known well
the extent of his own powers in abstaining from seeking the higher honours of his profession;
but no one doubted his law. He had once written a book,--on the mortgage of stocks in trade;
but that had been in early life, and he had never since dabbled in literature.

He was certainly a man of whom men were generally afraid. At the whist-table no one would venture
to scold him. In the court no one ever contradicted him. In his own house, though he was very
quiet, the servants dreaded to offend him, and were attentive to his slightest behests. When
he condescended to ride with any acquaintance in the park, it was always acknowledged that
old Wharton was to regulate the pace. His name was Abel, and all his life he had been known
as able Abe;--a silent, far-seeing, close-fisted, just old man, who was not, however, by any
means deficient in sympathy either with the sufferings or with the joys of humanity.

It was Easter time and the courts were not sitting, but Mr. Wharton was in his chamber as a
matter of course at ten o'clock. He knew no real homely comforts elsewhere,--unless at the
whist-table at the Eldon. He ate and drank and slept in his own house in Manchester Square,
but he could hardly be said to live there. It was not there that his mind was awake, and that
the powers of the man were exercised. When he came up from the dining-room to join his daughter
after dinner he would get her to sing him a song, and would then seat himself with a book.
But he never read in his own house, invariably falling into a sweet and placid slumber, from
which he was never disturbed till his daughter kissed him as she went to bed. Then he would
walk about the room, and look at his watch, and shuffle uneasily through half-an-hour till
his conscience allowed him to take himself to his chamber. He was a man of no pursuits in his
own house. But from ten in the morning till five, or often till six, in the evening, his mind
was active in some work. It was not now all law, as it used to be. In the drawer of the old
piece of furniture which stood just at the right hand of his own arm-chair there were various
books hidden away, which he was sometimes ashamed to have seen by his clients,--poetry and
novels and even fairy tales. For there was nothing Mr. Wharton could not read in his chambers,
though there was nothing that he could read in his own house. He had a large pleasant room
in which to sit, looking out from the ground floor of Stone Buildings on to the gardens belonging
to the Inn,--and here, in the centre of the metropolis, but in perfect quiet as far as the
outside world was concerned, he had lived and still lived his life.

At about noon on the day following that on which Lopez had made his sudden swoop on Mr. Parker
and had then dined with Everett Wharton, he called at Stone Buildings and was shown into the
lawyer's room. His quick eye at once discovered the book which Mr. Wharton half hid away, and
saw upon it Mr. Mudie's suspicious ticket. Barristers certainly never get their law books from
Mudie, and Lopez at once knew that his hoped-for father-in-law had been reading a novel. He
had not suspected such weakness, but argued well from it for the business he had in hand. There
must be a soft spot to be found about the heart of an old lawyer who spent his mornings in
such occupation. "How do you do, sir?" said Mr. Wharton rising from his seat. "I hope I see
you well, sir." Though he had been reading a novel his tone and manner were very cold. Lopez
had never been in Stone Buildings before, and was not quite sure that he might not have committed
some offence in coming there. "Take a seat, Mr. Lopez. Is there anything I can do for you in
my way?"

There was a great deal that could be done "in his way" as father;--but how was it to be introduced
and the case made clear? Lopez did not know whether the old man had as yet ever suspected such
a feeling as that which he now intended to declare. He had been intimate at the house in Manchester
Square, and had certainly ingratiated himself very closely with a certain Mrs. Roby, who had
been Mrs. Wharton's sister and constant companion, who lived in Berkeley Street, close round
the corner from Manchester Square, and spent very much of her time with Emily Wharton. They
were together daily, as though Mrs. Roby had assumed the part of a second mother, and Lopez
was well aware that Mrs. Roby knew of his love. If there was real confidence between Mrs. Roby
and the old lawyer, the old lawyer must know it also;--but as to that Lopez felt that he was
in the dark.

The task of speaking to an old father is not unpleasant when the lover knows that he has been
smiled upon, and, in fact, approved for the last six months. He is going to be patted on the
back, and made much of, and received into the family. He is to be told that his Mary or his
Augusta has been the best daughter in the world and will therefore certainly be the best wife,
and he himself will probably on that special occasion be spoken of with unqualified praise,--and
all will be pleasant. He had not been travel far and you could frequently doing it establish him

 But when you talk to a man about his daughter--!"

"I acknowledge freely your right of inquiry."

"And I know nothing of your means;--nothing whatever. I understand that you live as a man of
fortune, but I presume that you earn your bread. I know nothing of the way in which you earn
it, nothing of the certainty or amount of your means."

"Those things are of course matters for inquiry; but may I presume that you have no objection
which satisfactory answers to such questions may not remove?"

"I shall never willingly give my daughter to any one who is not the son of an English gentleman.
It may be a prejudice, but that is my feeling."

"My father was certainly not an English gentleman. He was a Portuguese." In admitting this,
and in thus subjecting himself at once to one clearly-stated ground of objection,--the objection
being one which, though admitted, carried with itself neither fault nor disgrace,--Lopez felt
that he had got a certain advantage. He could not get over the fact that he was the son of
a Portuguese parent, but by admitting that openly he thought he might avoid present discussion
on matters which might, perhaps, be more disagreeable, but to which he need not allude if the
accident of his birth were to be taken by the father as settling the question. "My mother was
an English lady," he added, "but my father certainly was not an Englishman. I never had the
common happiness of knowing either of them. I was an orphan before I understood what it was
to have a parent."

This was said with a pathos which for the moment stopped the expression of any further harsh
criticism from the lawyer. Mr. Wharton could not instantly repeat his objection to a parentage
which was matter for such melancholy reflections; but he felt at the same time that as he had
luckily landed himself on a positive and undeniable ground of objection to a match which was
distasteful to him, it would be unwise for him to go to other matters in which he might be
less successful. By doing so, he would seem to abandon the ground which he had already made
good. He thought it probable that the man might have an adequate income, and yet he did not
wish to welcome him as a son-in-law. He thought it possible that the Portuguese father might
be a Portuguese nobleman, and therefore one whom he would be driven to admit to have been in
some sort a gentleman;--but yet this man who was now in his presence and whom he continued
to scan with the closest observation, was not what he called a gentleman. The foreign blood
was proved, and that would suffice. As he looked at Lopez he thought that he detected Jewish
signs, but he was afraid to make any allusion to religion, lest Lopez should declare that his
ancestors had been noted as Christians since St. James first preached in the Peninsula.

"I was educated altogether in England," continued Lopez, "till I was sent to a German university
in the idea that the languages of the continent are not generally well learned in this country.
I can never be sufficiently thankful to my guardian for doing so."

"I dare say;--I dare say. French and German are very useful. I have a prejudice of my own in
favour of Greek and Latin."

"But I rather fancy I picked up more Greek and Latin at Bohn than I should have got here, had
I stuck to nothing else."

"I dare say;--I dare say. You may be an Admirable Crichton for what I know."

"I have not intended to make any boast, sir, but simply to vindicate those who had the care
of my education. If you have no objection except that founded on my birth, which is an accident--"

"When one man is a peer and another a ploughman, that is an accident. One doesn't find fault
with the ploughman, but one doesn't ask him to dinner."

"But my accident," said Lopez smiling, "is one which you would hardly discover unless you were
told. Had I called myself Talbot you would not know but that I was as good an Englishman as
yourself."

"A man of course may be taken in by falsehoods," said the lawyer.

"If you have no other objection than that raised, I hope you will allow me to visit in Manchester
Square."

"There may be ten thousand other objections, Mr. Lopez, but I really think that the one is
enough. Of course I know nothing of my daughter's feelings. I should imagine that the matter
is as strange to her as it is to me. But I cannot give you anything like encouragement. If
I am ever to have a son-in-law I should wish to have an English son-in-law. I do not even know
what your profession is."

"I am engaged in foreign loans."

"Very precarious I should think. A sort of gambling; isn't it?"

"It is the business by which many of the greatest mercantile houses in the city have been made."

"I dare say;--I dare say;--and by which they come to ruin. I have the greatest respect in the
world for mercantile enterprise, and have had as much to do as most men with mercantile questions.
But I ain't sure that I wish to marry my daughter in the City. Of course it's all prejudice.
I won't deny that on general subjects I can give as much latitude as any man; but when one's
own hearth is attacked--"

"Surely such a proposition as mine, Mr. Wharton, is no attack!"

"In my sense it is. When a man proposes to assault and invade the very kernel of another man's
heart, to share with him, and indeed to take from him, the very dearest of his possessions,
to become part and parcel with him either for infinite good or infinite evil, then a man has
a right to guard even his prejudices as precious bulwarks." Mr. Wharton as he said this was
walking about the room with his hands in his trowsers pockets. "I have always been for absolute
toleration in matters of religion,--have always advocated admission of Roman Catholics and
Jews into Parliament, and even to the Bench. In ordinary life I never question a man's religion.
It is nothing to me whether he believes in Mahomet, or has no belief at all. But when a man
comes to me for my daughter--"

"I have always belonged to the Church of England," said Ferdinand Lopez.

"Lopez is at any rate a bad name to go to a Protestant church with, and I don't want my daughter
to bear it. I am very frank with you, as in such a matter men ought to understand each other.
Personally I have liked you well enough and have been glad to see you at my house. Everett
and you have seemed to be friends, and I have had no objection to make. But marrying into a
family is a very serious thing indeed."

"No man feels that more strongly than I do, Mr. Wharton."

"There had better be an end of it."

"Even though I should be happy enough to obtain her favour?"

"I can't think that she cares about you. I don't think it for a moment. You say you haven't
spoken to her, and I am sure she's not a girl to throw herself at a man's head. I don't approve
it, and I think it had better fall to the ground. It must fall to the ground."

"I wish you would give me a reason."

"Because you are not English."

"But I am English. My father was a foreigner."

"It doesn't suit my ideas. I suppose I may have my own ideas about my own family, Mr. Lopez?
I feel perfectly certain that my child will do nothing to displease me, and this would displease
me. If we were to talk for an hour I could say nothing further."

"I hope that I may be able to present things to you in an aspect so altered," said Lopez as
he prepared to take his leave, "as to make you change your mind."

"Possibly;--possibly," said Wharton, "but I do not think it probable. Good morning to you,
sir. If I have said anything that has seemed to be unkind, put it down to my anxiety as a father
and not to my conduct as a man." Then the door was closed behind his visitor, and Mr. Wharton
was left walking up and down his room alone. He was by no means satisfied with himself. He
felt that he had been rude and at the same time not decisive. He had not explained to the man
as he would wish to have done, that it was monstrous and out of the question that a daughter
of the Whartons, one of the oldest families in England, should be given to a friendless Portuguese,--a
probable Jew,--about whom nobody knew anything. Then he remembered that sooner or later his
girl would have at least £60,000, a fact of which no human being but himself was aware. Would
it not be well that somebody should be made aware of it, so that his girl might have the chance
of suitors preferable to this swarthy son of Judah? He began to be afraid, as he thought of
it, that he was not managing his matters well. How would it be with him if he should find that
the girl was really in love with this swarthy son of Judah? He had never inquired about his
girl's heart, though there was one to whom he hoped that his girl's heart might some day be
given. He almost made up his mind to go home at once, so anxious was he. But the prospect of
having to spend an entire afternoon in Manchester Square was too much for him, and he remained
in his chamber till the usual hour.

Lopez, as he returned from Lincoln's Inn, westward to his club, was, on the whole, contented
with the interview. He had expected opposition. He had not thought that the cherry would fall
easily into his mouth. But the conversation generally had not taken those turns which he had
thought would be most detrimental to him.

CHAPTER IV

Mrs. Roby

Mr. Wharton, as he walked home, remembered that Mrs. Roby was to dine at his house on that
evening. During the remainder of the day, after the departure of Lopez, he had been unable
to take his mind from the consideration of the proposition made to him. He had tried the novel,
and he had tried Huggins v. the Trustees of the Charity of St. Ambox, a case of undeniable
importance in which he was engaged on the part of Huggins, but neither was sufficiently powerful
to divert his thoughts. Throughout the morning he was imagining what he would say to Emily
about this lover of hers,--in what way he would commence the conversation, and how he would
express his own opinion should he find that she was in any degree favourable to the man. Should
she altogether ignore the man's pretensions, there would be no difficulty. But if she hesitated,--if,
as was certainly possible, she should show any partiality for the man, then there would be
a knot which would require untying. Hitherto the intercourse between the father and daughter
had been simple and pleasant. He had given her everything she asked for, and she had obeyed
him in all the very few matters as to which he had demanded obedience. Questions of discipline,
as far as there had been any discipline, had generally been left to Mrs. Roby. Mrs. Roby was
to dine in Manchester Square to-day, and perhaps it would be well that he should have a few
words with Mrs. Roby before he spoke to his daughter.

Mrs. Roby had a husband, but Mr. Roby had not been asked to dine in the Square on this occasion.
Mrs. Roby dined in the Square very often, but Mr. Roby very seldom,--not probably above once
a year, on some special occasion. He and Mr. Wharton had married sisters, but they were quite
unlike in character and had never become friends. Mrs. Wharton had been nearly twenty years
younger than her husband; Mrs. Roby had been six or seven years younger than her sister; and
Mr. Roby was a year or two younger than his wife. The two men therefore belonged to different
periods of life, Mr. Roby at the present time being a florid youth of forty. He had a moderate
fortune, inherited from his mother, of which he was sufficiently careful; but he loved races,
and read sporting papers; he was addicted to hunting and billiards; he shot pigeons, and,--so
Mr. Wharton had declared calumniously more than once to an intimate friend,--had not an H in
his vocabulary. The poor man did drop an aspirate now and again; but he knew his defect and
strove hard, and with fair average success, to overcome it. But Mr. Wharton did not love him,
and they were not friends. Perhaps neither did Mrs. Roby love him very ardently. She was at
any rate almost always willing to leave her own house to come to the Square, and on such occasions
Mr. Roby was always willing to dine at the Nimrod, the club which it delighted him to frequent.

Mr. Wharton, on entering his own house, met his son on the staircase. "Do you dine at home
to-day, Everett?"

"Well, sir; no, sir. I don't think I do. I think I half promised to dine with a fellow at the
club."

"Don't you think you'd make things meet more easily about the end of the year if you dined
oftener here, where you have nothing to pay, and less frequently at the club, where you pay
for everything?"

"But what I should save you would lose, sir. That's the way I look at it."

"Then I advise you to look at it the other way, and leave me to take care of myself. Come in
here, I want to speak to you." Everett followed his father into a dingy back parlour, which
was fitted up with book shelves and was generally called the study, but which was gloomy and
comfortless because it was seldom used. "I have had your friend Lopez with me at my chambers
to-day. I don't like your friend Lopez."

"I am sorry for that, sir."

"He is a man as to whom I should wish to have a good deal of evidence before I would trust
him to be what he seems to be. I dare say he's clever."

"I think he's more than clever."

"I dare say;--and well instructed in some respects."

"I believe him to be a thorough linguist, sir."

"I dare say. I remember a waiter at an hotel in Holborn who could speak seven languages. It's
an accomplishment very necessary for a Courier or a Queen's Messenger."

"You don't mean to say, sir, that you disregard foreign languages?"

"I have said nothing of the kind. But in my estimation they don't stand in the place of principles,
or a profession, or birth, or country. I fancy there has been some conversation between you
about your sister."

"Certainly there has."

"A young man should be very chary how he speaks to another man, to a stranger, about his sister.
A sister's name should be too sacred for club talk."

"Club talk! Good heavens, sir; you don't think that I have spoken of Emily in that way? There
isn't a man in London has a higher respect for his sister than I have for mine. This man, by
no means in a light way but with all seriousness, has told me that he was attached to Emily;
and I, believing him to be a gentleman and well to do in the world, have referred him to you.
Can that have been wrong?"

"I don't know how he's 'to do', as you call it. I haven't asked, and I don't mean to ask. But
I doubt his being a gentleman. He is not an English gentleman. What was his father?"

"I haven't the least idea."

"Or his mother?"

"He has never mentioned her to me."

"Nor his family; nor anything of their antecedents? He is a man fallen out of the moon. All
that is nothing to us as passing acquaintances. Between men such ignorance should I think bar
absolute intimacy;--but that may be a matter of taste. But it should be held to be utterly
antagonistic to any such alliance as that of marriage. He seems to be a friend of yours. You
had better make him understand that it is quite out of the question. I have told him so, and
you had better repeat it." So saying, Mr. Wharton went upstairs to dress, and Everett, having
received his father's instructions, went away to the club.

When Mr. Wharton reached the drawing-room, he found Mrs. Roby alone, and he at once resolved
to discuss the matter with her before he spoke to his daughter. "Harriet," he said abruptly,
"do you know anything of one Mr. Lopez?"

"Mr. Lopez! Oh yes, I know him."

"Do you mean that he is an intimate friend?"

"As friends go in London, he is. He comes to our house, and I think that he hunts with Dick."
Dick was Mr. Roby.

"That's a recommendation."

"Well, Mr. Wharton, I hardly know what you mean by that," said Mrs. Roby, smiling. "I don't
think, my husband will do Mr. Lopez any harm; and I am sure Mr. Lopez won't do my husband any."

"I dare say not. But that's not the question. Roby can take care of himself."

"Quite so."

"And so I dare say can Mr. Lopez." At this moment Emily entered the room. "My dear," said her
father, "I am speaking to your aunt. Would you mind going downstairs and waiting for us? Tell
them we shall be ready for dinner in ten minutes." Then Emily passed out of the room, and Mrs.
Roby assumed a grave demeanour. "The man we are speaking of has been to me and has made an
offer for Emily." As he said this he looked anxiously into his sister-in-law's face, in order
that he might tell from that how far she favoured the idea of such a marriage,--and he thought
that he perceived at once that she was not averse to it. "You know it is quite out of the question,"
he continued.

"I don't know why it should be out of the question. But of course your opinion would have great
weight with Emily."

"Great weight! Well;--I should hope so. If not, I do not know whose opinion is to have weight.
In the first place the man is a foreigner."

"Oh, no;--he is English. But if he were a foreigner: many English girls marry foreigners."

"My daughter shall not;--not with my permission. You have not encouraged him, I hope."

"I have not interfered at all," said Mrs. Roby. But this was a lie. Mrs. Roby had interfered.
Mrs. Roby, in discussing the merits and character of the lover with the young lady, had always
lent herself to the lover's aid,--and had condescended to accept from the lover various presents
which she could hardly have taken had she been hostile to him.

"And now tell me about herself. Has she seen him often?"

"Why, Mr. Wharton, he has dined here, in the house, over and over again. I thought that you
were encouraging him."

"Heavens and earth!"

"Of course she has seen him. When a man dines at a house he is bound to call. Of course he
has called,--I don't know how often. And she has met him round the corner."--"Round the corner,"
in Manchester Square, meant Mrs. Roby's house in Berkeley Street.--"Last Sunday they were at
the Zoo together. Dick got them tickets. I thought you knew all about it."

"Do you mean that my daughter went to the Zoological Gardens alone with this man?" the father
asked in dismay.

"Dick was with them. I should have gone, only I had a headache. Did you not know she went?"

"Yes;--I heard about the Gardens. But I heard nothing of the man."

"I thought, Mr. Wharton, you were all in his favour."

"I am not at all in his favour. I dislike him particularly. For anything I know he may have
sold pencils about the streets like any other Jew-boy."

"He goes to church just as you do,--that is, if he goes anywhere; which I dare say he does
about as often as yourself, Mr. Wharton." Now Mr. Wharton, though he was a thorough and perhaps
a bigoted member of the Church of England, was not fond of going to church.

"Do you mean to tell me," he said, pressing his hands together, and looking very seriously
into his sister-in-law's face; "do you mean to tell me that she--likes him?"

"Yes;--I think she does like him."

"You don't mean to say--she's in love with him?"

"She has never told me that she is. Young ladies are shy of making such assertions as to their
own feelings before the due time for doing so has come. I think she prefers him to anybody
else; and that were he to propose to herself, she would give him her consent to go to you."

"He shall never enter this house again," said Mr. Wharton passionately.

"You must arrange that with her. If you have so strong an objection to him, I wonder that you
should have had him here at all."

"How was I to know? God bless my soul!--just because a man was allowed to dine here once or
twice! Upon my word, it's too bad!"

"Papa, won't you and aunt come down to dinner?" said Emily, opening the door gently. Then they
went down to dinner, and during the meal nothing was said about Mr. Lopez. But they were not
very merry together, and poor Emily felt sure that her own affairs had been discussed in a
troublesome manner.

CHAPTER V

"No One Knows Anything About Him"

Neither at dinner, on that evening at Manchester Square, nor after dinner, as long as Mrs.
Roby remained in the house, was a word said about Lopez by Mr. Wharton. He remained longer
than usual with his bottle of port wine in the dining-room; and when he went upstairs, he sat
himself down and fell asleep, almost without a sign. He did not ask for a song, nor did Emily
offer to sing. But as soon as Mrs. Roby was gone,--and Mrs. Roby went home, round the corner,
somewhat earlier than usual,--then Mr. Wharton woke up instantly and made inquiry of his daughter.

There had, however, been a few words spoken on the subject between Mrs. Roby and her niece
which had served to prepare Emily for what was coming. "Lopez has been to your father," said
Mrs. Roby, in a voice not specially encouraging for such an occasion. Then she paused a moment;
but her niece said nothing, and she continued, "Yes,--and your father has been blaming me,--as
if I had done anything! If he did not mean you to choose for yourself, why didn't he keep a
closer look-out?"

"I haven't chosen any one, Aunt Harriet."

"Well;--to speak fairly, I thought you had; and I have nothing to say against your choice.
As young men go, I think Mr. Lopez is as good as the best of them. I don't know why you shouldn't
have him. Of course you'll have money, but then I suppose he makes a large income himself.
As to Mr. Fletcher, you don't care a bit about him."

"Not in that way, certainly."

"No doubt your papa will have it out with you just now; so you had better make up your mind
what you will say to him. If you really like the man, I don't see why you shouldn't say so,
and stick to it. He has made a regular offer, and girls in these days are not expected to be
their father's slaves." Emily said nothing further to her aunt on that occasion, but finding
that she must in truth "have it out" with her father presently, gave herself up to reflection.
It might probably be the case that the whole condition of her future life would depend on the
way in which she might now "have it out" with her father.

I would not wish the reader to be prejudiced against Miss Wharton by the not unnatural feeling
which may perhaps be felt in regard to the aunt. Mrs. Roby was pleased with little intrigues,
was addicted to the amusement of fostering love affairs, was fond of being thought to be useful
in such matters, and was not averse to having presents given to her. She had married a vulgar
man; and, though she had not become like the man, she had become vulgar. She was not an eligible
companion for Mr. Wharton's daughter,--a matter as to which the father had not given himself
proper opportunities of learning the facts. An aunt in his close neighbourhood was so great
a comfort to him,--so ready and so natural an assistance to him in his difficulties! But Emily
Wharton was not in the least like her aunt, nor had Mrs. Wharton been at all like Mrs. Roby.
No doubt the contact was dangerous. Injury had perhaps already been done. It may be that some
slightest soil had already marred the pure white of the girl's natural character. But if so,
the stain was as yet too impalpable to be visible to ordinary eyes.

Emily Wharton was a tall, fair girl, with grey eyes, rather exceeding the average proportions
as well as height of women. Her features were regular and handsome, and her form was perfect;
but it was by her manner and her voice that she conquered, rather than by her beauty,--by those
gifts and by a clearness of intellect joined with that feminine sweetness which has its most
frequent foundation in self-denial. Those who knew her well, and had become attached to her,
were apt to endow her with all virtues, and to give her credit for a loveliness which strangers
did not find on her face. But as we do not light up our houses with our brightest lamps for
all comers, so neither did she emit from her eyes their brightest sparks till special occasion
for such shining had arisen. To those who were allowed to love her no woman was more lovable.
There was innate in her an appreciation of her own position as a woman, and with it a principle
of self-denial as a human being, which it was beyond the power of any Mrs. Roby to destroy
or even to defile by small stains.

Like other girls she had been taught to presume that it was her destiny to be married, and
like other girls she had thought much about her destiny. A young man generally regards it as
his destiny either to succeed or to fail in the world, and he thinks about that. To him marriage,
when it comes, is an accident to which he has hardly as yet given a thought. But to the girl
the matrimony which is or is not to be her destiny contains within itself the only success
or failure which she anticipates. The young man may become Lord Chancellor, or at any rate
earn his bread comfortably as a county court judge. But the girl can look forward to little
else than the chance of having a good man for her husband;--a good man, or if her tastes lie
in that direction, a rich man. Emily Wharton had doubtless thought about these things, and
she sincerely believed that she had found the good man in Ferdinand Lopez.

The man, certainly, was one strangely endowed with the power of creating a belief. When going
to Mr. Wharton at his chambers he had not intended to cheat the lawyer into any erroneous idea
about his family, but he had resolved that he would so discuss the questions of his own condition,
which would probably be raised, as to leave upon the old man's mind an unfounded conviction
that in regard to money and income he had no reason to fear question. Not a word had been said
about his money or his income. And Mr. Wharton had felt himself bound to abstain from allusion
to such matters from an assured feeling that he could not in that direction plant an enduring
objection. In this way Lopez had carried his point with Mr. Wharton. He had convinced Mrs.
Roby that among all the girl's attractions the greatest attraction for him was the fact that
she was Mrs. Roby's niece. He had made Emily herself believe that the one strong passion of
his life was his love for her, and this he had done without ever having asked for her love.
And he had even taken the trouble to allure Dick, and had listened to and had talked whole
pages out of Bell's Life. On his own behalf it must be acknowledged that he did love the girl,
as well perhaps as he was capable of loving any one;--but he had found out many particulars
as to Mr. Wharton's money before he had allowed himself to love her.

As soon as Mrs. Roby had gathered up her knitting, and declared, as she always did on such
occasions, that she could go round the corner without having any one to look after her, Mr.
Wharton began. "Emily, my dear, come here." Then she came and sat on a footstool at his feet,
and looked up into his face. "Do you know what I am going to speak to you about, my darling?"

"Yes, papa; I think I do. It is about--Mr. Lopez."

"Your aunt has told you, I suppose. Yes; it is about Mr. Lopez. I have been very much astonished
to-day by Mr. Lopez,--a man of whom I have seen very little and know less. He came to me to-day
and asked for my permission--to address you." She sat perfectly quiet, still looking at him,
but she did not say a word. "Of course I did not give him permission."

"Why of course, papa?"

"Because he is a stranger and a foreigner. Would you have wished me to tell him that he might
come?"

"Yes, papa." He was sitting on a sofa and shrank back a little from her as she made this free
avowal. "In that case I could have judged for myself. I suppose every girl would like to do that."

"But should you have accepted him?"

"I think I should have consulted you before I did that. But I should have wished to accept
him. Papa, I do love him. I have never said so before to any one. I would not say so to you
now, if he had not--spoken to you as he has done."

"Emily, it must not be."

"Why not, papa? If you say it shall not be so, it shall not. I will do as you bid me." Then
he put out his hand and caressed her, stroking down her hair. "But I think you ought to tell
me why it must not be,--as I do love him."

"He is a foreigner."

"But is he? And why should not a foreigner be as good as an Englishman? His name is foreign,
but he talks English and lives as an Englishman."

"He has no relatives, no family, no belongings. He is what we call an adventurer. Marriage,
my dear, is a most serious thing."

"Yes, papa, I know that."

"One is bound to be very careful. How can I give you to a man I know nothing about,--an adventurer?
What would they say in Herefordshire?"

"I don't know why they should say anything, but if they did I shouldn't much care."

"I should, my dear. I should care very much. One is bound to think of one's family. Suppose
it should turn out afterwards that he was--disreputable!"

"You may say that of any man, papa."

"But when a man has connexions, a father and mother, or uncles and aunts, people that everybody
knows about, then there is some guarantee of security. Did you ever hear this man speak of
his father?"

"I don't know that I ever did."

"Or his mother,--or his family? Don't you think that is suspicious?"

"I will ask him, papa, if you wish."

"No, I would have you ask him nothing. I would not wish that there should be opportunity for
such asking. If there has been intimacy between you, such information should have come naturally,--as
a thing of course. You have made him no promise?"

"Oh no, papa."

"Nor spoken to him--of your regard for him?"

"Never;--not a word. Nor he to me,--except in such words as one understands even though they
say nothing."

"I wish he had never seen you."

"Is he a bad man, papa?"

"Who knows? I cannot tell. He may be ever so bad. How is one to know whether a man be bad or
good when one knows nothing about him?" At this point the father got up and walked about the
room. "The long and the short of it is that you must not see him any more."

"Did you tell him so?"

"Yes;--well; I don't know whether I said exactly that, but I told him that the whole thing
must come to an end. And it must. Luckily it seems that nothing has been said on either side."

"But, papa--; is there to be no reason?"

"Haven't I given reasons? I will not have my daughter encourage an adventurer,--a man of whom
nobody knows anything. That is reason sufficient."

"He has a business, and he lives with gentlemen. He is Everett's friend. He is well educated;--oh,
so much better than most men that one meets. And he is clever. Papa, I wish you knew him better
than you do."

"I do not want to know him better."

"Is not that prejudice, papa?"

"My dear Emily," said Mr. Wharton, striving to wax into anger that he might be firm against
her, "I don't think that it becomes you to ask your father such a question as that. You ought
to believe that it is the chief object of my life to do the best I can for my children."

"I am sure it is."

"And you ought to feel that, as I have had a long experience in the world, my judgment about
a young man might be trusted."

That was a statement which Miss Wharton was not prepared to admit. She had already professed
herself willing to submit to her father's judgment, and did not now by any means contemplate
rebellion against parental authority. But she did feel that on a matter so vital to her she
had a right to plead her cause before judgment should be given, and she was not slow to assure
herself, even as this interview went on, that her love for the man was strong enough to entitle
her to assure her father that her happiness depended on his reversal of the sentence already
pronounced. "You know, papa, that I trust you," she said. "And I have promised you that I will
not disobey you. If you tell me that I am never to see Mr. Lopez again, I will not see him."

"You are a good girl. You were always a good girl."

"But I think that you ought to hear me." Then he stood still with his hands in his trowsers
pockets looking at her. He did not want to hear a word, but he felt that he would be a tyrant
if he refused. "If you tell me that I am not to see him, I shall not see him. But I shall be
very unhappy. I do love him, and I shall never love any one else in the same way."

"That is nonsense, Emily. There is Arthur Fletcher."

"I am sure you will never ask me to marry a man I do not love, and I shall never love Arthur
Fletcher. If this is to be as you say, it will make me very, very wretched. It is right that
you should know the truth. If it is only because Mr. Lopez has a foreign name--"

"It isn't only that; no one knows anything about him, or where to inquire even."

"I think you should inquire, papa, and be quite certain before you pronounce such a sentence
against me. It will be a crushing blow." He looked at her, and saw that there was a fixed purpose
in her countenance of which he had never before seen similar signs. "You claim a right to my
obedience, and I acknowledge it. I am sure you believe me when I promise not to see him without
your permission."

"I do believe you. Of course I believe you."

"But if I do that for you, papa, I think that you ought to be very sure, on my account, that
I haven't to bear such unhappiness for nothing. You'll think about it, papa,--will you not,
before you quite decide?" She leaned against him as she spoke, and he kissed her. "Good night,
now, papa. You will think about it?"

"I will. I will. Of course I will."

And he began the process of thinking about it immediately,--before the door was closed behind
her. But what was there to think about? Nothing that she had said altered in the least his
idea about the man. He was as convinced as ever that unless there was much to conceal there
would not be so much concealment. But a feeling began to grow upon him already that his daughter
had a mode of pleading with him which he would not ultimately be able to resist. He had the
power, he knew, of putting an end to the thing altogether. He had only to say resolutely and
unchangeably that the thing shouldn't be, and it wouldn't be. If he could steel his heart against
his daughter's sorrow for, say, a twelvemonth, the victory would be won. But he already began
to fear that he lacked the power to steel his heart against his daughter.

CHAPTER VI

An Old Friend Goes to Windsor

"And what are they going to make you now?"

This question was asked of her husband by a lady with whom perhaps the readers of this volume
may have already formed some acquaintance. Chronicles of her early life have been written,
at any rate copiously. The lady was the Duchess of Omnium, and her husband was of course the
Duke. In order that the nature of the question asked by the duchess may be explained, it must
be stated that just at this time the political affairs of the nation had got themselves tied
up into one of those truly desperate knots from which even the wisdom and experience of septuagenarian
statesmen can see no unravelment. The heads of parties were at a standstill. In the House of
Commons there was, so to say, no majority on either side. The minds of members were so astray
that, according to the best calculation that could be made, there would be a majority of about
ten against any possible Cabinet. There would certainly be a majority against either of those
well-tried but, at this moment, little-trusted Prime Ministers, Mr. Gresham and Mr. Daubeny.
There were certain men, nominally belonging to this or to the other party, who would certainly
within a week of the nomination of a Cabinet in the House, oppose the Cabinet which they ought
to support. Mr. Daubeny had been in power,--nay, was in power, though he had twice resigned.
Mr. Gresham had been twice sent for to Windsor, and had on one occasion undertaken and on another
had refused to undertake to form a Ministry. Mr. Daubeny had tried two or three combinations,
and had been at his wits' end. He was no doubt still in power,--could appoint bishops, and
make peers, and give away ribbons. But he couldn't pass a law, and certainly continued to hold
his present uncomfortable position by no will of his own. But a Prime Minister cannot escape
till he has succeeded in finding a successor; and though the successor be found and consents
to make an attempt, the old unfortunate cannot be allowed to go free when that attempt is shown
to be a failure. He has not absolutely given up the keys of his boxes, and no one will take
them from him. Even a sovereign can abdicate; but the Prime Minister of a constitutional government
is in bonds. The reader may therefore understand that the Duchess was asking her husband what
place among the political rulers of the country had been offered to him by the last aspirant
to the leadership of the Government.

But the reader should understand more than this, and may perhaps do so, if he has ever seen
those former chronicles to which allusion has been made. The Duke, before he became a duke,
had held very high office, having been Chancellor of the Exchequer. When he was transferred,
perforce, to the House of Lords, he had,--as is not uncommon in such cases,--accepted a lower
political station. This had displeased the Duchess, who was ambitious both on her own behalf
and that of her lord,--and who thought that a Duke of Omnium should be nothing in the Government
if not at any rate near the top. But after that, with the simple and single object of doing
some special piece of work for the nation,--something which he fancied that nobody else would
do if he didn't do it,--his Grace, of his own motion, at his own solicitation, had encountered
further official degradation, very much to the disgust of the Duchess. And it was not the way
with her Grace to hide such sorrows in the depth of her bosom. When affronted she would speak
out, whether to her husband, or to another,--using irony rather than argument to support her
cause and to vindicate her ways. The shafts of ridicule hurled by her against her husband in
regard to his voluntary abasement had been many and sharp. They stung him, but never for a
moment influenced him. And though they stung him, they did not even anger him. It was her nature
to say such things,--and he knew that they came rather from her uncontrolled spirit than from
any malice. She was his wife too, and he had an idea that of little injuries of that sort there
should be no end of bearing on the part of a husband. Sometimes he would endeavour to explain
to her the motives which actuated him; but he had come to fear that they were and must ever
be unintelligible to her. But he credited her with less than her real intelligence. She did
understand the nature of his work and his reasons for doing it; and, after her own fashion,
did what she conceived to be her own work in endeavouring to create within his bosom a desire
for higher things. "Surely," she said to herself, "if a man of his rank is to be a minister
he should be a great minister;--at any rate as great as his circumstances will make him. A
man never can save his country by degrading himself." In this he would probably have agreed;
but his idea of degradation and hers hardly tallied.

When therefore she asked him what they were going to make him, it was as though some sarcastic
housekeeper in a great establishment should ask the butler,--some butler too prone to yield
in such matters,--whether the master had appointed him lately to the cleaning of shoes or the
carrying of coals. Since these knots had become so very tight, and since the journeys to Windsor
had become so very frequent, her Grace had asked many such questions, and had received but
very indifferent replies. The Duke had sometimes declared that the matter was not ripe enough
to allow him to make any answer. "Of course," said the Duchess, "you should keep the secret.
The editors of the evening papers haven't known it for above an hour." At another time he told
her that he had undertaken to give Mr. Gresham his assistance in any way in which it might
be asked. "Joint Under-Secretary with Lord Fawn, I should say," answered the Duchess. Then
he told her that he believed an attempt would be made at a mixed ministry, but that he did
not in the least know to whom the work of doing so would be confided. "You will be about the
last man who will be told," replied the Duchess. Now, at this moment, he had, as she knew,
come direct from the house of Mr. Gresham, and she asked her question in her usual spirit.
"And what are they going to make you now?"

But he did not answer the question in his usual manner. He would customarily smile gently at
her badinage, and perhaps say a word intended to show that he was not in the least moved by
her raillery. But in this instance he was very grave, and stood before her a moment making
no answer at all, looking at her in a sad and almost solemn manner. "They have told you that
they can do without you," she said, breaking out almost into a passion. "I knew how it would
be. Men are always valued by others as they value themselves."

"I wish it were so," he replied. "I should sleep easier to-night."

"What is it, Plantagenet?" she exclaimed, jumping up from her chair.

"I never cared for your ridicule hitherto, Cora; but now I feel that I want your sympathy."

"If you are going to do anything,--to do really anything, you shall have it. Oh, how you shall
have it!"

"I have received her Majesty's orders to go down to Windsor at once. I must start within half-an-hour."

"You are going to be Prime Minister!" she exclaimed. As she spoke she threw her arms up, and
then rushed into his embrace. Never since their first union had she been so demonstrative either
of love or admiration. "Oh, Plantagenet," she said, "if I can only do anything I will slave
for you." As he put his arm round her waist he already felt the pleasantness of her altered
way to him. She had never worshipped him yet, and therefore her worship when it did come had
all the delight to him which it ordinarily has to the newly married hero.

"Stop a moment, Cora. I do not know how it may be yet. But this I know, that if without cowardice
I could avoid this task, I would certainly avoid it."

"Oh no! And there would be cowardice; of course there would," said the Duchess, not much caring
what might be the bonds which bound him to the task so long as he should certainly feel himself
to be bound.

"He has told me that he thinks it my duty to make the attempt."

"Who is he?"

"Mr. Gresham. I do not know that I should have felt myself bound by him, but the Duke said
so also." This duke was our duke's old friend, the Duke of St. Bungay.

"Was he there? And who else?"

"No one else. It is no case for exultation, Cora, for the chances are that I shall fail. The
Duke has promised to help me, on condition that one or two he has named are included, and that
one or two whom he has also named are not. In each case I should myself have done exactly as
he proposes."

"And Mr. Gresham?"

"He will retire. That is a matter of course. He will intend to support us; but all that is
veiled in the obscurity which is always, I think, darker as to the future of politics than
any other future. Clouds arise, one knows not why or whence, and create darkness when one expected
light. But as yet, you must understand, nothing is settled. I cannot even say what answer I
may make to her Majesty, till I know what commands her Majesty may lay upon me."

"You must keep a hold of it now, Plantagenet," said the Duchess, clenching her own fist.

"I will not even close a finger on it with any personal ambition," said the Duke. "If I could
be relieved from the burden this moment it would be an ease to my heart. I remember once,"
he said,--and as he spoke he again put his arm around her waist, "when I was debarred from
taking office by a domestic circumstance."

"I remember that too," she said, speaking very gently and looking up at him.

"It was a grief to me at the time, though it turned out so well,--because the office then suggested
to me was one which I thought I could fill with credit to the country. I believed in myself
then as far as that work went. But for this attempt I have no belief in myself. I doubt whether
I have any gift for governing men."

"It will come."

"It may be that I must try;--and it may be that I must break my heart because I fail. But I
shall make the attempt if I am directed to do so in any manner that shall seem feasible. I
must be off now. The Duke is to be here this evening. They had better have dinner ready for
me whenever I may be able to eat it." Then he took his departure before she could say another word.

When the Duchess was alone she took to thinking of the whole thing in a manner which they who
best knew her would have thought to be very unusual with her. She already possessed all that
rank and wealth could give her, and together with those good things a peculiar position of
her own, of which she was proud, and which she had made her own not by her wealth or rank,
but by a certain fearless energy and power of raillery which never deserted her. Many feared
her and she was afraid of none, and many also loved her,--whom she also loved, for her nature
was affectionate. She was happy with her children, happy with her friends, in the enjoyment
of perfect health, and capable of taking an exaggerated interest in anything that might come
uppermost for the moment. One would have been inclined to say that politics were altogether
unnecessary to her, and that as Duchess of Omnium, lately known as Lady Glencora Palliser,
she had a wider and a pleasanter influence than could belong to any woman as wife of a Prime
Minister. And she was essentially one of those women who are not contented to be known simply
as the wives of their husbands. She had a celebrity of her own, quite independent of his position,
and which could not be enhanced by any glory or any power added to him. Nevertheless, when
he left her to go down to the Queen with the prospect of being called upon to act as chief
of the incoming ministry, her heart throbbed with excitement. It had come at last, and he would
be, to her thinking, the leading man in the greatest kingdom in the world.

But she felt in regard to him somewhat as did Lady Macbeth towards her lord.

      "What thou would'st highly,
   That would'st thou holily."

She knew him to be full of scruples, unable to bend when aught was to be got by bending, unwilling
to domineer when men might be brought to subjection only by domination. The first duty never
could be taught to him. To win support by smiles when his heart was bitter within him would
never be within the power of her husband. He could never be brought to buy an enemy by political
gifts,--would never be prone to silence his keenest opponent by making him his right hand supporter.
But the other lesson was easier and might she thought be learned. Power is so pleasant that
men quickly learn to be greedy in the enjoyment of it, and to flatter themselves that patriotism
requires them to be imperious. She would be constant with him day and night to make him understand
that his duty to his country required him to be in very truth its chief ruler. And then with
some knowledge of things as they are,--and also with much ignorance,--she reflected that he
had at his command a means of obtaining popularity and securing power, which had not belonged
to his immediate predecessors, and had perhaps never to the same extent been at the command
of any minister in England. His wealth as Duke of Omnium had been great; but hers, as available
for immediate purposes, had been greater even than his. After some fashion, of which she was
profoundly ignorant, her own property was separated from his and reserved to herself and her
children. Since her marriage she had never said a word to him about her money,--unless it were
to ask that something out of the common course might be spent on some, generally absurd, object.
But now had come the time for squandering money. She was not only rich but she had a popularity
that was exclusively her own. The new Prime Minister and the new Prime Minister's wife should
entertain after a fashion that had never yet been known even among the nobility of England.
Both in town and country those great mansions should be kept open which were now rarely much
used because she had found them dull, cold, and comfortless. In London there should not be
a Member of Parliament whom she would not herself know and influence by her flattery and grace,--or
if there were men whom she could not influence, they should live as men tabooed and unfortunate.
Money mattered nothing. Their income was enormous, and for a series of years,--for half-a-dozen
years if the game could be kept up so long,--they could spend treble what they called their
income without real injury to their children. Visions passed through her brain of wondrous
things which might be done,--if only her husband would be true to his own greatness.

The Duke had left her about two. She did not stir out of the house that day, but in the course
of the afternoon she wrote a line to a friend who lived not very far from her. The Duchess
dwelt in Carlton Terrace, and her friend in Park Lane. The note was as follows:--

   DEAR M.,

   Come to me at once. I am too excited to go to you.

   Yours,

   G.

This was addressed to one Mrs. Finn, a lady as to whom chronicles also have been written, and
who has been known to the readers of such chronicles as a friend dearly loved by the Duchess.
As quickly as she could put on her carriage garments and get herself taken to Carlton Terrace,
Mrs. Finn was there. "Well, my dear, how do you think it's all settled at last?" said the Duchess.
It will probably be felt that the new Prime Minister's wife was indiscreet, and hardly worthy
of the confidence placed in her by her husband. But surely we all have some one friend to whom
we tell everything, and with the Duchess Mrs. Finn was that one friend.

"Is the Duke to be Prime Minister?"

"How on earth should you have guessed that?"

"What else could make you so excited? Besides, it is by no means strange. I understand that
they have gone on trying the two old stagers till it is useless to try them any longer; and
if there is to be a fresh man, no one would be more likely than the Duke."

"Do you think so?"

"Certainly. Why not?"

"He has frittered away his political position by such meaningless concessions. And then he
had never done anything to put himself forward,--at any rate since he left the House of Commons.
Perhaps I haven't read things right,--but I was surprised, very much surprised."

"And gratified?"

"Oh yes. I can tell you everything, because you will neither misunderstand me nor tell tales
of me. Yes,--I shall like him to be Prime Minister, though I know that I shall have a bad time
of it myself."

"Why a bad time?"

"He is so hard to manage. Of course I don't mean about politics. Of course it must be a mixed
kind of thing at first, and I don't care a straw whether it run to Radicalism or Toryism. The
country goes on its own way, either for better or for worse, whichever of them are in. I don't
think it makes any difference as to what sort of laws are passed. But among ourselves, in our
set, it makes a deal of difference who gets the garters, and the counties, who are made barons
and then earls, and whose name stands at the head of everything."

"That is your way of looking at politics?"

"I own it to you;--and I must teach it to him."

"You never will do that, Lady Glen."

"Never is a long word. I mean to try. For look back and tell me of any Prime Minister who has
become sick of his power. They become sick of the want of power when it's falling away from
them,--and then they affect to disdain and put aside the thing they can no longer enjoy. Love
of power is a kind of feeling which comes to a man as he grows older."

"Politics with the Duke have been simple patriotism," said Mrs. Finn.

"The patriotism may remain, my dear, but not the simplicity. I don't want him to sell his country
to Germany, or to turn it into an American republic in order that he may be president. But
when he gets the reins in his hands, I want him to keep them there. If he's so much honester
than other people, of course he's the best man for the place. We must make him believe that
the very existence of the country depends on his firmness."

"To tell you the truth, Lady Glen, I don't think you'll ever make the Duke believe anything.
What he believes, he believes either from very old habit, or from the working of his own mind."

"You're always singing his praises, Marie."

"I don't know that there is any special praise in what I say; but as far as I can see, it is
the man's character."

"Mr. Finn will come in, of course," said the Duchess.

"Mr. Finn will be like the Duke in one thing. He'll take his own way as to being in or out
quite independently of his wife."

"You'd like him to be in office?"

"No, indeed! Why should I? He would be more often at the House, and keep later hours, and be
always away all the morning into the bargain. But I shall like him to do as he likes himself."

"Fancy thinking of all that. I'd sit up all night every night of my life.--I'd listen to every
debate in the House myself,--to have Plantagenet Prime Minister. I like to be busy. Well now,
if it does come off--"

"It isn't settled, then?"

"How can one hope that a single journey will settle it, when those other men have been going
backwards and forwards between Windsor and London, like buckets in a well, for the last three
weeks? But if it is settled, I mean to have a cabinet of my own, and I mean that you shall
do the foreign affairs."

"You'd better let me be at the exchequer. I'm very good at accounts."

"I'll do that myself. The accounts that I intend to set a-going would frighten any one less
audacious. And I mean to be my own home secretary, and to keep my own conscience,--and to be
my own master of the ceremonies certainly. I think a small cabinet gets on best. Do you know,--I
should like to put the Queen down."

"What on earth do you mean?"

"No treason; nothing of that kind. But I should like to make Buckingham Palace second-rate;
and I'm not quite sure but I can. I dare say you don't quite understand me."

"I don't think that I do, Lady Glen."

"You will some of these days. Come in to-morrow before lunch. I suppose I shall know all about
it then, and shall have found that my basket of crockery has been kicked over and every thing
smashed."

CHAPTER VII

Another Old Friend

At about nine the Duke had returned, and was eating his very simple dinner in the breakfast-room,--a
beefsteak and a potato, with a glass of sherry and Apollinaris water. No man more easily satisfied
as to what he eat and drank lived in London in those days. As regarded the eating and drinking
he dined alone, but his wife sat with him and waited on him, having sent the servant out of
the room. "I have told her Majesty that I would do the best I could," said the Duke.

"Then you are Prime Minister."

"Not at all. Mr. Daubeny is Prime Minister. I have undertaken to form a ministry, if I find
it practicable, with the assistance of such friends as I possess. I never felt before that
I had to lean so entirely on others as I do now."

"Lean on yourself only. Be enough for yourself."

"Those are empty words, Cora;--words that are quite empty. In one sense a man should always
be enough for himself. He should have enough of principle and enough of conscience to restrain
him from doing what he knows to be wrong. But can a ship-builder build his ship single-handed,
or the watchmaker make his watch without assistance? On former occasions such as this, I could
say, with little or no help from without, whether I would or would not undertake the work that
was proposed to me, because I had only a bit of the ship to build, or a wheel of the watch
to make. My own efficacy for my present task depends entirely on the co-operation of others,
and unfortunately upon that of some others with whom I have no sympathy, nor have they with me."

"Leave them out," said the Duchess boldly.

"But they are men who will not be left out, and whose services the country has a right to expect."

"Then bring them in, and think no more about it. It is no good crying for pain that cannot
be cured."

"Co-operation is difficult without community of feeling. I find myself to be too stubborn-hearted
for the place. It was nothing to me to sit in the same Cabinet with a man I disliked when I
had not put him there myself. But now--. As I have travelled up I have almost felt that I could
not do it! I did not know before how much I might dislike a man."

"Who is the one man?"

"Nay;--whoever he be, he will have to be a friend now, and therefore I will not name him, even
to you. But it is not one only. If it were one, absolutely marked and recognised, I might avoid
him. But my friends, real friends, are so few! Who is there besides the Duke on whom I can
lean with both confidence and love?"

"Lord Cantrip."

"Hardly so, Cora. But Lord Cantrip goes out with Mr. Gresham. They will always cling together."

"You used to like Mr. Mildmay."

"Mr. Mildmay,--yes! If there could be a Mr. Mildmay in the Cabinet, this trouble would not
come upon my shoulders."

"Then I'm very glad that there can't be a Mr. Mildmay. Why shouldn't there be as good fish
in the sea as ever were caught out of it?"

"When you've got a good fish you like to make as much of it as you can."

"I suppose Mr. Monk will join you."

"I think we shall ask him. But I am not prepared to discuss men's names as yet."

"You must discuss them with the Duke immediately."

"Probably;--but I had better discuss them with him before I fix my own mind by naming them
even to you."

"You'll bring Mr. Finn in, Plantagenet?"

"Mr. Finn!"

"Yes;--Phineas Finn,--the man who was tried."

"My dear Cora, we haven't come down to that yet. We need not at any rate trouble ourselves
about the small fishes till we are sure that we can get big fishes to join us."

"I don't know why he should be a small fish. No man has done better than he has; and if you
want a man to stick to you--"

"I don't want a man to stick to me. I want a man to stick to his country."

"You were talking about sympathy."

"Well, yes;--I was. But do not name any one else just at present. The Duke will be here soon,
and I would be alone till he comes."

"There is one thing I want to say, Plantagenet."

"What is it?"

"One favour I want to ask."

"Pray do not ask anything for any man just at present."

"It is not anything for any man."

"Nor for any woman."

"It is for a woman,--but one whom I think you would wish to oblige."

"Who is it?" Then she curtseyed, smiling at him drolly, and put her hand upon her breast. "Something
for you! What on earth can you want that I can do for you?"

"Will you do it,--if it be reasonable?"

"If I think it reasonable, I certainly will do it."

Then her manner changed altogether, and she became serious and almost solemn. "If, as I suppose,
all the great places about her Majesty be changed, I should like to be Mistress of the Robes."

"You!" said he, almost startled out of his usual quiet demeanour.

"Why not I? Is not my rank high enough?"

"You burden yourself with the intricacies and subserviences, with the tedium and pomposities
of Court life! Cora, you do not know what you are talking about, or what you are proposing
for yourself."

"If I am willing to try to undertake a duty, why should I be debarred from it any more than you?"

"Because I have put myself into a groove, and ground myself into a mould, and clipped and pared
and pinched myself all round,--very ineffectually, as I fear,--to fit myself for this thing.
You have lived as free as air. You have disdained,--and though I may have grumbled I have still
been proud to see you disdain,--to wrap yourself in the swaddling bandages of Court life. You
have ridiculed all those who have been near her Majesty as Court ladies."

"The individuals, Plantagenet, perhaps; but not the office. I am getting older now, and I do
not see why I should not begin a new life." She had been somewhat quelled by his unexpected
energy, and was at the moment hardly able to answer him with her usual spirit.

"Do not think of it, my dear. You asked whether your rank was high enough. It must be so, as
there is, as it happens, none higher. But your position, should it come to pass that your husband
is the head of the Government, will be too high. I may say that in no condition should I wish
my wife to be subject to other restraint than that which is common to all married women. I
should not choose that she should have any duties unconnected with our joint family and home.
But as First Minister of the Crown I would altogether object to her holding an office believed
to be at my disposal." She looked at him with her large eyes wide open, and then left him without
a word. She had no other way of showing her displeasure, for she knew that when he spoke as
he had spoken now all argument was unavailing.

The Duke remained an hour alone before he was joined by the other Duke, during which he did
not for a moment apply his mind to the subject which might be thought to be most prominent
in his thoughts,--the filling up, namely, of a list of his new government. All that he could
do in that direction without further assistance had been already done very easily. There were
four or five certain names,--names that is of certain political friends, and three or four
almost equally certain of men who had been political enemies, but who would now clearly be
asked to join the ministry. Sir Gregory Grogram, the late Attorney-General, would of course
be asked to resume his place; but Sir Timothy Beeswax, who was up to this moment Solicitor-General
for the Conservatives, would also be invited to retain that which he held. Many details were
known, not only to the two dukes who were about to patch up the ministry between them, but
to the political world at large,--and were facts upon which the newspapers were able to display
their wonderful foresight and general omniscience with their usual confidence. And as to the
points which were in doubt,--whether or not, for instance, that consistent old Tory Sir Orlando
Drought should be asked to put up with the Post-office or should be allowed to remain at the
Colonies,--the younger Duke did not care to trouble himself till the elder should have come
to his assistance. But his own position and his questionable capacity for filling it,--that
occupied all his mind. If nominally first he would be really first. Of so much it seemed to
him that his honour required him to assure himself. To be a fainéant ruler was in direct antagonism
both to his conscience and his predilections. To call himself by a great name before the world,
and then to be something infinitely less than that name, would be to him a degradation. But
though he felt fixed as to that, he was by no means assured as to that other point, which to
most men firm in their resolves as he was, and backed up as he had been by the confidence of
others, would be cause of small hesitation. He did doubt his ability to fill that place which
it would now be his duty to occupy. He more than doubted. He told himself again and again that
there was wanting to him a certain noble capacity for commanding support and homage from other
men. With things and facts he could deal, but human beings had not opened themselves to him.
But now it was too late! and yet,--as he said to his wife,--to fail would break his heart!
No ambition had prompted him. He was sure of himself there. One only consideration had forced
him into this great danger, and that had been the assurance of others that it was his manifest
duty to encounter it. And now there was clearly no escape,--no escape compatible with that
clean-handed truth from which it was not possible for him to swerve. He might create difficulties
in order that through them a way might still be opened to him of restoring to the Queen the
commission which had been entrusted to him. He might insist on this or that impossible concession.
But the memory of escape such as that would break his heart as surely as the failure.

When the Duke was announced he rose to greet his old friend almost with fervour. "It is a shame,"
he said, "to bring you out so late. I ought to have gone to you."

"Not at all. It is always the rule in these cases that the man who has most to do should fix
himself as well as he can where others may be able to find him." The Duke of St. Bungay was
an old man, between seventy and eighty, with hair nearly white, and who on entering the room
had to unfold himself out of various coats and comforters. But he was in full possession not
only of his intellects but of his bodily power, showing, as many politicians do show, that
the cares of the nation may sit upon a man's shoulders for many years without breaking or even
bending them. For the Duke had belonged to ministries for nearly the last half century. As
the chronicles have also dealt with him, no further records of his past life shall now be given.

He had said something about the Queen, expressing gracious wishes for the comfort of her Majesty
in all these matters, something of the inconvenience of these political journeys to and fro,
something also of the delicacy and difficulty of the operations on hand which were enhanced
by the necessity of bringing men together as cordial allies who had hitherto acted with bitter
animosity one to another, before the younger Duke said a word. "We may as well," said the elder,
"make out some small provisional list, and you can ask those you name to be with you early
to-morrow. But perhaps you have already made a list."

"No indeed. I have not even had a pencil in my hand."

"We may as well begin then," said the elder, facing the table when he saw that his less-experienced
companion made no attempt at beginning.

"There is something horrible to me in the idea of writing down men's names for such a work
as this, just as boys at school used to draw out the elevens for a cricket match." The old
stager turned round and stared at the younger politician. "The thing itself is so momentous
that one ought to have aid from heaven."

Plantagenet Palliser was the last man from whom the Duke of St. Bungay would have expected
romance at any time, and, least of all, at such a time as this. "Aid from heaven you may have,"
he said, "by saying your prayers; and I don't doubt you ask it for this and all other things
generally. But an angel won't come to tell you who ought to be Chancellor of the Exchequer."

"No angel will, and therefore I wish that I could wash my hands of it." His old friend still
stared at him. "It is like sacrilege to me, attempting this without feeling one's own fitness
for the work. It unmans me,--this necessity of doing that which I know I cannot do with fitting
judgment."

"Your mind has been a little too hard at work to-day."

"It hasn't been at work at all. I've had nothing to do, and have been unable really to think
of work. But I feel that chance circumstances have put me into a position for which I am unfit,
and which yet I have been unable to avoid. How much better would it be that you should do this
alone,--you yourself."

"Utterly out of the question. I do know and think that I always have known my own powers. Neither
has my aptitude in debate nor my capacity for work justified me in looking to the premiership.
But that, forgive me, is now not worthy of consideration. It is because you do work and can
work, and because you have fitted yourself for that continued course of lucid explanation which
we now call debate, that men on both sides have called upon you as the best man to come forward
in this difficulty. Excuse me, my friend, again, if I say that I expect to find your manliness
equal to your capacity."

"If I could only escape from it!"

"Psha;--nonsense!" said the old Duke, getting up. "There is such a thing as a conscience with
so fine an edge that it will allow a man to do nothing. You've got to serve your country. On
such assistance as I can give you you know that you may depend with absolute assurance. Now
let us get to work. I suppose you would wish that I should take the chair at the Council."

"Certainly;--of course," said the Duke of Omnium, turning to the table. The one practical suggestion
had fixed him, and from that moment he gave himself to the work in hand with all his energies.
It was not very difficult, nor did it take them a very long time. If the future Prime Minister
had not his names at his fingers' ends, the future President of the Council had them. Eight
men were soon named whom it was thought well that the Duke of Omnium should consult early in
the morning as to their willingness to fill certain places.

"Each one of them may have some other one or some two whom he may insist on bringing with him,"
said the elder Duke; "and though of course you cannot yield to the pressure in every such case,
it will be wise to allow yourself scope for some amount of concession. You'll find they'll
shake down after the usual amount of resistance and compliance. No;--don't you leave your house
to-morrow to see anybody unless it be Mr. Daubeny or her Majesty. I'll come to you at two,
and if her Grace will give me luncheon, I'll lunch with her. Good night, and don't think too
much of the bigness of the thing. I remember dear old Lord Brock telling me how much more difficult
it was to find a good coachman than a good Secretary of State." The Duke of Omnium, as he sat
thinking of things for the next hour in his chair, succeeded only in proving to himself that
Lord Brock never ought to have been Prime Minister of England after having ventured to make
so poor a joke on so solemn a subject.

CHAPTER VIII

The Beginning of a New Career

By the time that the Easter holidays were over,--holidays which had been used so conveniently
for the making of a new government,--the work of getting a team together had been accomplished
by the united energy of the two dukes and other friends. The filling up of the great places
had been by no means so difficult or so tedious,--nor indeed the cause of half so many heartburns,--as
the completion of the list of the subordinates. Noblesse oblige. The Secretaries of State,
and the Chancellors, and the First Lords, selected from this or the other party, felt that
the eyes of mankind were upon them, and that it behoved them to assume a virtue if they had
it not. They were habitually indifferent to self-exaltation, and allowed themselves to be thrust
into this or that unfitting role, professing that the Queen's Government and the good of the
country were their only considerations. Lord Thrift made way for Sir Orlando Drought at the
Admiralty, because it was felt on all sides that Sir Orlando could not join the new composite
party without high place. And the same grace was shown in regard to Lord Drummond, who remained
at the Colonies, keeping the office to which he had been lately transferred under Mr. Daubeny.
And Sir Gregory Grogram said not a word, whatever he may have thought, when he was told that
Mr. Daubeny's Lord Chancellor, Lord Ramsden, was to keep the seals. Sir Gregory did, no doubt,
think very much about it; for legal offices have a signification differing much from that which
attaches itself to places simply political. A Lord Chancellor becomes a peer, and on going
out of office enjoys a large pension. When the woolsack has been reached there comes an end
of doubt, and a beginning of ease. Sir Gregory was not a young man, and this was a terrible
blow. But he bore it manfully, saying not a word when the Duke spoke to him; but he became
convinced from that moment that no more inefficient lawyer ever sat upon the English bench,
or a more presumptuous politician in the British Parliament, than Lord Ramsden.

The real struggle, however, lay in the appropriate distribution of the Rattlers and the Robys,
the Fitzgibbons and the Macphersons among the subordinate offices of State. Mr. Macpherson
and Mr. Roby, with a host of others who had belonged to Mr. Daubeny, were prepared, as they
declared from the first, to lend their assistance to the Duke. They had consulted Mr. Daubeny
on the subject, and Mr. Daubeny told them that their duty lay in that direction. At the first
blush of the matter the arrangement took the form of a gracious tender from themselves to a
statesman called upon to act in very difficult circumstances,--and they were thanked accordingly
by the Duke, with something of real cordial gratitude. But when the actual adjustment of things
was in hand, the Duke, having but little power of assuming a soft countenance and using soft
words while his heart was bitter, felt on more than one occasion inclined to withdraw his thanks.
He was astounded not so much by the pretensions as by the unblushing assertion of these pretensions
in reference to places which he had been innocent enough to think were always bestowed at any
rate without direct application. He had measured himself rightly when he told the older duke
in one of those anxious conversations which had been held before the attempt was made, that
long as he had been in office himself he did not know what was the way of bestowing office.
"Two gentlemen have been here this morning," he said one day to the Duke of St. Bungay, "one
on the heels of the other, each assuring me not only that the whole stability of the enterprise
depends on my giving a certain office to him,--but actually telling me to my face that I had
promised it to him!" The old statesman laughed. "To be told within the same half-hour by two
men that I had made promises to each of them inconsistent with each other!"

"Who were the two men?"

"Mr. Rattler and Mr. Roby."

"I am assured that they are inseparable since the work was begun. They always had a leaning
to each other, and now I hear they pass their time between the steps of the Carlton and Reform
Clubs."

"But what am I to do? One must be Patronage Secretary, no doubt."

"They're both good, men in their way, you know."

"But why do they come to me with their mouths open, like dogs craving a bone? It used not to
be so. Of course men were always anxious for office as they are now."

"Well; yes. We've heard of that before to-day, I think."

"But I don't think any man ever ventured to ask Mr. Mildmay."

"Time had done much for him in consolidating his authority, and perhaps the present world is
less reticent in its eagerness than it was in his younger days. I doubt, however, whether it
is more dishonest, and whether struggles were not made quite as disgraceful to the strugglers
as anything that is done now. You can't alter the men, and you must use them." The younger
Duke sat down and sighed over the degenerate patriotism of the age.

But at last even the Rattlers and Robys were fixed, if not satisfied, and a complete list of
the ministry appeared in all the newspapers. Though the thing had been long a-doing, still
it had come suddenly,--so that at the first proposition to form a coalition ministry, the newspapers
had hardly known whether to assist or to oppose the scheme. There was no doubt, in the minds
of all these editors and contributors, the teaching of a tradition that coalitions of this
kind have been generally feeble, sometimes disastrous, and on occasions even disgraceful. When
a man, perhaps through a long political life, has bound himself to a certain code of opinions,
how can he change that code at a moment? And when at the same moment, together with the change,
he secures power, patronage, and pay, how shall the public voice absolve him? But then again
men, who have by the work of their lives grown into a certain position in the country, and
have unconsciously but not therefore less actually made themselves indispensable either to
this side in politics or to that, cannot free themselves altogether from the responsibility
of managing them when a period comes such as that now reached. This also the newspapers perceived;
and having, since the commencement of the Session, been very loud in exposing the disgraceful
collapse of government affairs, could hardly refuse their support to any attempt at a feasible
arrangement. When it was first known that the Duke of Omnium had consented to make the attempt,
they had both on one side and the other been loud in his praise, going so far as to say that
he was the only man in England who could do the work. It was probably this encouragement which
had enabled the new Premier to go on with an undertaking which was personally distasteful to
him, and for which from day to day he believed himself to be less and less fit. But when the
newspapers told him that he was the only man for the occasion, how could he be justified in
crediting himself in preference to them?

The work in Parliament began under the new auspices with great tranquillity. That there would
soon come causes of hot blood,--the English Church, the county suffrage, the income tax, and
further education questions,--all men knew who knew anything. But for the moment, for the month
even, perhaps for the Session, there was to be peace, with full latitude for the performance
of routine duties. There was so to say no opposition, and at first it seemed that one special
bench in the House of Commons would remain unoccupied. But after a day or two,--on one of which
Mr. Daubeny had been seen sitting just below the gangway,--that gentleman returned to the place
usually held by the Prime Minister's rival, saying with a smile that it might be for the convenience
of the House that the seat should be utilised. Mr. Gresham at this time had, with declared
purpose, asked and obtained the Speaker's leave of absence and was abroad. Who should lead
the House? That had been a great question, caused by the fact that the Prime Minister was in
the House of Lords;--and what office should the Leader hold? Mr. Monk had consented to take
the Exchequer, but the right to sit opposite to the Treasury Box and to consider himself for
the time the principal spirit in that chamber was at last assigned to Sir Orlando Drought.
"It will never do," said Mr. Rattler to Mr. Roby. "I don't mean to say anything against Drought,
who has always been a very useful man to your party;--but he lacks something of the position."

"The fact is," said Roby, "that we've trusted to two men so long that we don't know how to
suppose any one else big enough to fill their places. Monk wouldn't have done. The House doesn't
care about Monk."

"I always thought it should be Wilson, and so I told the Duke. He had an idea that it should
be one of your men."

"I think he's right there," said Roby. "There ought to be something like a fair division. Individuals
might be content, but the party would be dissatisfied. For myself, I'd have sooner stayed out
as an independent member, but Daubeny said that he thought I was bound to make myself useful."

"It was rather awkward;--wasn't it?"

"I have spoken now because you seemed to think so." His manner to her was not very pleasant,
but Mrs. Roby had known him for many years, and did not care very much for his manner. She
had an object to gain, and could put up with a good deal for the sake of her object.

"Very well. Then I shall know how to act. But, Mr. Wharton, I must say this, you know Emily
has a will of her own, and you must not hold me responsible for anything that may occur." As
soon as he heard this he almost resolved to withdraw the concession he had made;--but he did
not do so.

Very soon after this there came a special invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Roby, asking the Whartons,
father and daughter, to dine with them round the corner. It was quite a special invitation,
because it came in the form of a card,--which was unusual between the two families. But the
dinner was too, in some degree, a special dinner,--as Emily was enabled to explain to her father,
the whole speciality having been fully detailed to herself by her aunt. Mr. Roby, whose belongings
were not generally aristocratic, had one great connexion with whom, after many years of quarrelling,
he had lately come into amity. This was his half-brother, considerably older than himself,
and was no other than that Mr. Roby who was now Secretary to the Admiralty, and who in the
last Conservative Government had been one of the Secretaries to the Treasury. The oldest Mr.
Roby of all, now long since gathered to his fathers, had had two wives and two sons. The elder
son had not been left as well off as friends, or perhaps as he himself, could have wished.
But he had risen in the world by his wits, had made his way into Parliament, and had become,
as all readers of these chronicles know, a staff of great strength to his party. But he had
always been a poor man. His periods of office had been much shorter than those of his friend
Rattler, and his other sources of income had not been certain. His younger half-brother, who,
as far as the great world was concerned, had none of his elder brother's advantages, had been
endowed with some fortune from his mother, and,--in an evil hour for both of them,--had lent
the politician money. As one consequence of this transaction, they had not spoken to each other
for years. On this quarrel Mrs. Roby was always harping with her own husband,--not taking his
part. Her Roby, her Dick, had indeed the means of supporting her with a fair comfort, but had,
of his own, no power of introducing her to that sort of society for which her soul craved.
But Mr. Thomas Roby was a great man,--though unfortunately poor,--and moved in high circles.
Because they had lent their money,--which no doubt was lost for ever,--why should they also
lose the advantages of such a connexion? Would it not be wiser rather to take the debt as a
basis whereon to found a claim for special fraternal observation and kindred social intercourse?
Dick, who was fond of his money, would not for a long time look at the matter in this light,
but harassed his brother from time to time by applications which were quite useless, and which
by the acerbity of their language altogether shut Mrs. Roby out from the good things which
might have accrued to her from so distinguished a brother-in-law. But when it came to pass
that Thomas Roby was confirmed in office by the coalition which has been mentioned, Mrs. Dick
became very energetic. She went herself to the official hero and told him how desirous she
was of peace. Nothing more should be said about the money,--at any rate for the present. Let
brothers be brothers. And so it came to pass that the Secretary to the Admiralty with his wife
were to dine in Berkeley Street, and that Mr. Wharton was asked to meet them.

"I don't particularly want to meet Mr. Thomas Roby," the old barrister said.

"They want you to come," said Emily, "because there has been some family reconciliation. You
usually do go once or twice a year."

"I suppose it may as well be done," said Mr. Wharton.

"I think, papa, that they mean to ask Mr. Lopez," said Emily demurely.

"I told you before that I don't want to have you banished from your aunt's home by any man,"
said the father. So the matter was settled, and the invitation was accepted. This was just
at the end of May, at which time people were beginning to say that the coalition was a success,
and some wise men to predict that at last fortuitous parliamentary atoms had so come together
by accidental connexion, that a ministry had been formed which might endure for a dozen years.
Indeed there was no reason why there should be any end to a ministry built on such a foundation.
Of course this was very comfortable to such men as Mr. Roby, so that the Admiralty Secretary
when he entered his sister-in-law's drawing-room was suffused with that rosy hue of human bliss
which a feeling of triumph bestows. "Yes," said he, in answer to some would-be facetious remark
from his brother, "I think we have weathered that storm pretty well. It does seem rather odd,
my sitting cheek by jowl with Mr. Monk and gentlemen of that kidney; but they don't bite. I've
got one of our own set at the head of our own office, and he leads the House. I think upon
the whole we've got a little the best of it." This was listened to by Mr. Wharton with great
disgust,--for Mr. Wharton was a Tory of the old school, who hated compromises, and abhorred
in his heart the class of politicians to whom politics were a profession rather than a creed.

Mr. Roby senior, having escaped from the House, was of course the last, and had indeed kept
all the other guests waiting half-an-hour,--as becomes a parliamentary magnate in the heat
of the Session. Mr. Wharton, who had been early, saw all the other guests arrive, and among
them Mr. Ferdinand Lopez. There was also Mr. Mills Happerton,--partner in Hunky and Sons,--with
his wife, respecting whom Mr. Wharton at once concluded that he was there as being the friend
of Ferdinand Lopez. If so, how much influence must Ferdinand Lopez have in that house! Nevertheless,
Mr. Mills Happerton was in his way a great man, and a credit to Mrs. Roby. And there were Sir
Damask and Lady Monogram, who were people moving quite in the first circles. Sir Damask shot
pigeons, and so did also Dick Roby,--whence had perhaps arisen an intimacy. But Lady Monogram
was not at all a person to dine with Mrs. Dick Roby without other cause than this. But a great
official among one's acquaintance can do so much for one! It was probable that Lady Monogram's
presence was among the first fruits of the happy family reconciliation that had taken place.
Then there was Mrs. Leslie, a pretty widow, rather poor, who was glad to receive civilities
from Mrs. Roby, and was Emily Wharton's pet aversion. Mrs. Leslie had said impertinent things
to her about Ferdinand Lopez, and she had snubbed Mrs. Leslie. But Mrs. Leslie was serviceable
to Mrs. Roby, and had now been asked to her great dinner party.

But the two most illustrious guests have not yet been mentioned. Mrs. Roby had secured a lord,--an
absolute peer of Parliament! This was no less a man than Lord Mongrober, whose father had been
a great judge in the early part of the century, and had been made a peer. The Mongrober estates
were not supposed to be large, nor was the Mongrober influence at this time extensive. But
this nobleman was seen about a good deal in society when the dinners given were supposed to
be worth eating. He was a fat, silent, red-faced, elderly gentleman, who said very little,
and who when he did speak seemed always to be in an ill-humour. He would now and then make
ill-natured remarks about his friends' wines, as suggesting '68 when a man would boast of his
'48 claret; and when costly dainties were supplied for his use, would remark that such and
such a dish was very well at some other time of the year. So that ladies attentive to their
tables and hosts proud of their cellars would almost shake in their shoes before Lord Mongrober.
And it may also be said that Lord Mongrober never gave any chance of retaliation by return
dinners. There lived not the man or woman who had dined with Lord Mongrober. But yet the Robys
of London were glad to entertain him; and the Mrs. Robys, when he was coming, would urge their
cooks to superhuman energies by the mention of his name.

And there was Lady Eustace! Of Lady Eustace it was impossible to say whether her beauty, her
wit, her wealth, or the remarkable history of her past life, most recommended her to such hosts
and hostesses as Mr. and Mrs. Roby. As her history may be already known to some, no details
of it shall be repeated here. At this moment she was free from all marital persecution, and
was very much run after by a certain set in society. There were others again who declared that
no decent man or woman ought to meet her. On the score of lovers there was really little or
nothing to be said against her; but she had implicated herself in an unfortunate second marriage,
and then there was that old story about the jewels! But there was no doubt about her money
and her good looks, and some considered her to be clever. These completed the list of Mrs.
Roby's great dinner party.

Mr. Wharton, who had arrived early, could not but take notice that Lopez, who soon followed
him into the room, had at once fallen into conversation with Emily, as though there had never
been any difficulty in the matter. The father, standing on the rug and pretending to answer
the remarks made to him by Dick Roby, could see that Emily said but little. The man, however,
was so much at his ease that there was no necessity for her to exert herself. Mr. Wharton hated
him for being at his ease. Had he appeared to have been rebuffed by the circumstances of his
position the prejudices of the old man would have been lessened. By degrees the guests came.
Lord Mongrober stood also on the rug, dumb, with a look of intense impatience for his food,
hardly ever condescending to answer the little attempts at conversation made by Mrs. Dick.
Lady Eustace gushed into the room, kissing Mrs. Dick and afterwards kissing her great friend
of the moment, Mrs. Leslie, who followed. She then looked as though she meant to kiss Lord
Mongrober, whom she playfully and almost familiarly addressed. But Lord Mongrober only grunted.
Then came Sir Damask and Lady Monogram, and Dick at once began about his pigeons. Sir Damask,
who was the most good-natured man in the world, interested himself at once and became energetic;
but Lady Monogram looked round the room carefully, and seeing Lady Eustace, turned up her nose,
nor did she care much for meeting Lord Mongrober. If she had been taken in as to the Admiralty
Robys, then would she let the junior Robys know what she thought about it. Mills Happerton,
with his wife, caused the frown on Lady Monogram's brow to loosen itself a little, for, so
great was the wealth and power of the house of Hunky and Sons, that Mr. Mills Happerton was
no doubt a feature at any dinner party. Then came the Admiralty Secretary with his wife, and
the order for dinner was given.

CHAPTER X

Mrs. Dick's Dinner Party.--No. II

Dick walked downstairs with Lady Monogram. There had been some doubt whether of right he should
not have taken Lady Eustace, but it was held by Mrs. Dick that her ladyship had somewhat impaired
her rights by the eccentricities of her career, and also that she would amiably pardon any
little wrong against her of that kind,--whereas Lady Monogram was a person to be much considered.
Then followed Sir Damask with Lady Eustace. They seemed to be paired so well together that
there could be no doubt about them. The ministerial Roby, who was really the hero of the night,
took Mrs. Happerton, and our friend Mr. Wharton took the Secretary's wife. All that had been
easy,--so easy that fate had good-naturedly arranged things which are sometimes difficult of
management. But then there came an embarrassment. Of course it would in a usual way be right
that a married man as was Mr. Happerton should be assigned to the widow Mrs. Leslie, and that
the only two "young" people,--in the usual sense of the word,--should go down to dinner together.
But Mrs. Roby was at first afraid of Mr. Wharton, and planned it otherwise. When, however,
the last moment came she plucked up courage, gave Mrs. Leslie to the great commercial man,
and with a brave smile asked Lopez to give his arm to the lady he loved. It is sometimes so
hard to manage these "little things," said she to Lord Mongrober as she put her hand upon his
arm. His lordship had been kept standing in that odious drawing-room for more than half-an-hour
waiting for a man whom he regarded as a poor Treasury hack, and was by no means in a good humour.
Dick Roby's wine was no doubt good, but he was not prepared to purchase it at such a price
as this. "Things always get confused when you have waited an hour for any one," he said. "What
can one do, you know, when the House is sitting?" said the lady apologetically. "Of course
you lords can get away, but then you have nothing to do." Lord Mongrober grunted, meaning to
imply by his grunt that any one would be very much mistaken who supposed that he had any work
to do because he was a peer of Parliament.

Lopez and Emily were seated next to each other, and immediately opposite to them was Mr. Wharton.
Certainly nothing fraudulent had been intended on this occasion,--or it would have been arranged
that the father should sit on the same side of the table with the lover, so that he should
see nothing of what was going on. But it seemed to Mr. Wharton as though he had been positively
swindled by his sister-in-law. There they sat opposite to him, talking to each other apparently
with thoroughly mutual confidence, the very two persons whom he most especially desired to
keep apart. He had not a word to say to either of the ladies near him. He endeavoured to keep
his eyes away from his daughter as much as possible, and to divert his ears from their conversation;--but
he could not but look and he could not but listen. Not that he really heard a sentence. Emily's
voice hardly reached him, and Lopez understood the game he was playing much too well to allow
his voice to travel. And he looked as though his position were the most commonplace in the
world, and as though he had nothing of more than ordinary interest to say to his neighbour.
Mr. Wharton, as he sat there, almost made up his mind that he would leave his practice, give
up his chambers, abandon even his club, and take his daughter at once to--to;--it did not matter
where, so that the place should be very distant from Manchester Square. There could be no other
remedy for this evil.

Lopez, though he talked throughout the whole of dinner,--turning sometimes indeed to Mrs. Leslie
who sat at his left hand,--said very little that all the world might not have heard. But he
did say one such word. "It has been so dreary to me, the last month!" Emily of course had no
answer to make to this. She could not tell him that her desolation had been infinitely worse
than his, and that she had sometimes felt as though her very heart would break. "I wonder whether
it must always be like this with me," he said,--and then he went back to the theatres, and
other ordinary conversation.

 It was better, perhaps, to do it in this way, than to make any direct
proposition. And then, early in June, she spoke to him as to the guests to be invited to Gatherum
Castle in August. "Do you want to go to Gatherum in August?" he asked in surprise. For she
hated the place, and had hardly been content to spend ten days there every year at Christmas.

"I think it should be done," she said solemnly. "One cannot quite consider just now what one
likes oneself."

"Why not?"

"You would hardly go to a small place like Matching in your present position. There are so
many people whom you should entertain! You would probably have two or three of the foreign
ministers down for a time."

"We always used to find plenty of room at Matching."

"But you did not always use to be Prime Minister. It is only for such a time as this that such
a house as Gatherum is serviceable."

He was silent for a moment, thinking about it, and then gave way without another word. She
was probably right. There was the huge pile of magnificent buildings; and somebody, at any
rate, had thought that it behoved a Duke of Omnium to live in such a palace. If it ought to
be done at any time, it ought to be done now. In that his wife had been right. "Very well.
Then let us go there."

"I'll manage it all," said the Duchess,--"I and Locock." Locock was the house-steward.

"I remember once," said the Duke, and he smiled as he spoke with a peculiarly sweet expression,
which would at times come across his generally inexpressive face,--"I remember once that some
First Minister of the Crown gave evidence as to the amount of his salary, saying that his place
entailed upon him expenses higher than his stipend would defray. I begin to think that my experience
will be the same."

"Does that fret you?"

"No, Cora;--it certainly does not fret me, or I should not allow it. But I think there should
be a limit. No man is ever rich enough to squander."

Though they were to squander her fortune,--the money which she had brought,--for the next ten
years at a much greater rate than she contemplated, they might do so without touching the Palliser
property. Of that she was quite sure. And the squandering was to be all for his glory,--so
that he might retain his position as a popular Prime Minister. For an instant it occurred to
her that she would tell him all this. But she checked herself, and the idea of what she had
been about to say brought the blood into her face. Never yet had she in talking to him alluded
to her own wealth. "Of course we are spending money," she said. "If you give me a hint to hold
my hand, I will hold it."

He had looked at her, and read it all in her face. "God knows," he said, "you've a right to
do it if it pleases you."

"For your sake!" Then he stooped down and kissed her twice, and left her to arrange her parties
as she pleased. After that she congratulated herself that she had not made the direct proposition,
knowing that she might now do pretty much what she pleased.

Then there were solemn cabinets held, at which she presided, and Mrs. Finn and Locock assisted.
At other cabinets it is supposed that, let a leader be ever so autocratic by disposition and
superior by intelligence, still he must not unfrequently yield to the opinion of his colleagues.
But in this cabinet the Duchess always had her own way, though she was very persistent in asking
for counsel. Locock was frightened about the money. Hitherto money had come without a word,
out of the common, spoken to the Duke. The Duke had always signed certain cheques, but they
had been normal cheques; and the money in its natural course had flown in to meet them;--but
now he must be asked to sign abnormal cheques. That, indeed, had already been done; but still
the money had been there. A large balance, such as had always stood to his credit, would stand
a bigger racket than had yet been made. But Locock was quite sure that the balance ought not
to be much further reduced,--and that steps must be taken. Something must be sold! The idea
of selling anything was dreadful to the mind of Locock! Or else money must be borrowed! Now
the management of the Palliser property had always been conducted on principles antagonistic
to borrowing. "But his Grace has never spent his income," said the Duchess. That was true.
But the money, as it showed a tendency to heap itself up, had been used for the purchase of
other bits of property, or for the amelioration of the estates generally. "You don't mean to
say that we can't get money if we want it!" Locock was profuse in his assurances that any amount
of money could be obtained,--only that something must be done. "Then let something be done,"
said the Duchess, going on with her general plans. "Many people are rich," said the Duchess
afterwards to her friend, "and some people are very rich indeed; but nobody seems to be rich
enough to have ready money to do just what he wishes. It all goes into a grand sum total, which
is never to be touched without a feeling of sacrifice. I suppose you have always enough for
everything." It was well known that the present Mrs. Finn, as Madame Goesler, had been a wealthy
woman.

"Indeed, no;--very far from that. I haven't a shilling."

"What has happened?" asked the Duchess, pretending to be frightened.

"You forget that I've got a husband of my own, and that he has to be consulted."

"That must be nonsense. But don't you think women are fools to marry when they've got anything
of their own, and could be their own mistresses? I couldn't have been. I was made to marry
before I was old enough to assert myself."

"And how well they did for you!"

"Pas si mal.--He's Prime Minister, which is a great thing, and I begin to find myself filled
to the full with political ambition. I feel myself to be a Lady Macbeth, prepared for the murder
of any Duncan or any Daubeny who may stand in my lord's way. In the meantime, like Lady Macbeth
herself, we must attend to the banqueting. Her lord appeared and misbehaved himself; my lord
won't show himself at all,--which I think is worse."

Our old friend Phineas Finn, who had now reached a higher place in politics than even his political
dreams had assigned to him, though he was a Member of Parliament, was much away from London
in these days. New brooms sweep clean; and official new brooms, I think, sweep cleaner than
any other. Who has not watched at the commencement of a Ministry some Secretary, some Lord,
or some Commissioner, who intends by fresh Herculean labours to cleanse the Augean stables
just committed to his care? Who does not know the gentleman at the Home Office, who means to
reform the police and put an end to malefactors; or the new Minister at the Board of Works,
who is to make London beautiful as by a magician's stroke,--or, above all, the new First Lord,
who is resolved that he will really build us a fleet, purge the dock-yards, and save us half
a million a year at the same time? Phineas Finn was bent on unriddling the Irish sphinx. Surely
something might be done to prove to his susceptible countrymen that at the present moment no
curse could be laid upon them so heavy as that of having to rule themselves apart from England;
and he thought that this might be the easier, as he became from day to day more thoroughly
convinced that those Home Rulers who were all around him in the House were altogether of the
same opinion. Had some inscrutable decree of fate ordained and made it certain,--with a certainty
not to be disturbed,--that no candidate could be returned to Parliament who would not assert
the earth to be triangular, there would rise immediately a clamorous assertion of triangularity
among political aspirants. The test would be innocent. Candidates have swallowed, and daily
do swallow, many a worse one. As might be this doctrine of a great triangle, so is the doctrine
of Home Rule. Why is a gentleman of property to be kept out in the cold by some O'Mullins because
he will not mutter an unmeaning shibboleth? "Triangular? Yes,--or lozenge-shaped, if you please;
but, gentlemen, I am the man for Tipperary." Phineas Finn, having seen, or thought that he
had seen, all this, began, from the very first moment of his appointment, to consider painfully
within himself whether the genuine services of an honest and patriotic man might not compass
some remedy for the present ill-boding ferment of the country. What was it that the Irish really
did want;--what that they wanted, and had not got, and which might with propriety be conceded
to them? What was it that the English really would refuse to sanction, even though it might
not be wanted? He found himself beating about among rocks as to Catholic education and Papal
interference, the passage among which might be made clearer to him in Irish atmosphere than
in that of Westminster. Therefore he was away a good deal in these days, travelling backwards
and forwards as he might be wanted for any debate. But as his wife did not accompany him on
these fitful journeys, she was able to give her time very much to the Duchess.

The Duchess was on the whole very successful with her parties. There were people who complained
that she had everybody; that there was no selection whatever as to politics, principles, rank,
morals,--or even manners. But in such a work as the Duchess had now taken in hand, it was impossible
that she should escape censure. They who really knew what was being done were aware that nobody
was asked to that house without an idea that his or her presence might be desirable,--in however
remote a degree. Paragraphs in newspapers go for much, and therefore the writers and editors
of such paragraphs were there,--sometimes with their wives. Mr. Broune, of the "Breakfast Table,"
was to be seen there constantly, with his wife Lady Carbury, and poor old Booker of the "Literary
Chronicle." City men can make a budget popular or the reverse, and therefore the Mills Happertons
of the day were welcome. Rising barristers might be wanted to become Solicitors-General. The
pet Orpheus of the hour, the young tragic actor who was thought to have a real Hamlet within
him, the old painter who was growing rich on his reputation, and the young painter who was
still strong with hope, even the little trilling poet, though he trilled never so faintly,
and the somewhat wooden novelist, all had tongues of their own, and certain modes of expression,
which might assist or injure the Palliser Coalition,--as the Duke's Ministry was now called.

"Who is that man? I've seen him here before. The Duchess was talking to him ever so long just
now." The question was asked by Mr. Rattler of Mr. Roby. About half-an-hour before this time
Mr. Rattler had essayed to get a few words with the Duchess, beginning with the communication
of some small political secret. But the Duchess did not care much for the Rattlers attached
to her husband's Government. They were men whose services could be had for a certain payment,--and
when paid for were, the Duchess thought, at the Premier's command without further trouble.
Of course they came to the receptions, and were entitled to a smile apiece as they entered.
But they were entitled to nothing more, and on this occasion Rattler had felt himself to be
snubbed. It did not occur to him to abuse the Duchess. The Duchess was too necessary for abuse,--just
at present. But any friend of the Duchess,--any favourite for the moment,--was, of course,
open to remark.

"He is a man named Lopez," said Roby, "a friend of Happerton;--a very clever fellow, they say."

"Did you ever see him anywhere else?"

"Well, yes;--I have met him at dinner."

"He was never in the House. What does he do?" Rattler was distressed to think that any drone
should have made its way into the hive of working bees.

"Oh;--money, I fancy."

"He's not a partner in Hunky's, is he?"

"I fancy not. I think I should have known if he was."

"She ought to remember that people make a use of coming here," said Rattler. She was, of course,
the Duchess. "It's not like a private house. And whatever influence outsiders get by coming,
so much she loses. Somebody ought to explain that to her."

"I don't think you or I could do that," replied Mr. Roby.

"I'll tell the Duke in a minute," said Rattler. Perhaps he thought he could tell the Duke,
but we may be allowed to doubt whether his prowess would not have fallen below the necessary
pitch when he met the Duke's eye.

Lopez was there for the third time, about the middle of June, and had certainly contrived to
make himself personally known to the Duchess. There had been a deputation from the City to
the Prime Minister asking for a subsidised mail, via San Francisco, to Japan, and Lopez, though
he had no interest in Japan, had contrived to be one of the number. He had contrived also,
as the deputation was departing, to say a word on his own account to the Minister, and had
ingratiated himself. The Duke had remembered him, and had suggested that he should have a card.
And now he was among the flowers and the greatness, the beauty, the politics, and the fashion
of the Duchess's gatherings for the third time. "It is very well done,--very well, indeed,"
said Mr. Boffin to him. Lopez had been dining with Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, and had now again encountered
his late host and hostess. Mr. Boffin was a gentleman who had belonged to the late Ministry,
but had somewhat out-Heroded Herod in his Conservatism, so as to have been considered to be
unfit for the Coalition. Of course, he was proud of his own staunchness, and a little inclined
to criticise the lax principles of men who, for the sake of carrying on her Majesty's Government,
could be Conservatives one day and Liberals the next. He was a laborious, honest man,--but
hardly of calibre sufficient not to regret his own honesty in such an emergency as the present.
It is easy for most of us to keep our hands from picking and stealing when picking and stealing
plainly lead to prison diet and prison garments. But when silks and satins come of it, and
with the silks and satins general respect, the net result of honesty does not seem to be so
secure. Whence will come the reward, and when? On whom the punishment, and where? A man will
not, surely, be damned for belonging to a Coalition Ministry! Boffin was a little puzzled as
he thought on all this, but in the meantime was very proud of his own consistency.

"I think it is so lovely!" said Mrs. Boffin. "You look down through an Elysium of rhododendrons
into a Paradise of mirrors. I don't think there was ever anything like it in London before."

"I don't know that we ever had anybody at the same time rich enough to do this kind of thing
as it is done now," said Boffin, "and powerful enough to get such people together. If the country
can be ruled by flowers and looking-glasses, of course it is very well."

"Flowers and looking-glasses won't prevent the country being ruled well," said Lopez.

"I'm not so sure of that," continued Boffin. "We all know what bread and the games came to
in Rome."

"What did they come to?" asked Mrs. Boffin.

"To a man burning Rome, my dear, for his amusement, dressed in a satin petticoat and a wreath
of roses."

"I don't think the Duke will dress himself like that," said Mrs. Boffin.

"And I don't think," said Lopez, "that the graceful expenditure of wealth in a rich man's house
has any tendency to demoralise the people."

"The attempt here," said Boffin severely, "is to demoralise the rulers of the people. I am
glad to have come once to see how the thing is done; but as an independent member of the House
of Commons I should not wish to be known to frequent the saloon of the Duchess." Then Mr. Boffin
took away Mrs. Boffin, much to that lady's regret.

"This is fairy land," said Lopez to the Duchess, as he left the room.

"Come and be a fairy then," she answered, very graciously. "We are always on the wing about
this hour on Wednesday night." The words contained a general invitation for the season, and
were esteemed by Lopez as an indication of great favour. It must be acknowledged of the Duchess
that she was prone to make favourites, perhaps without adequate cause; though it must be conceded
to her that she rarely altogether threw off from her any one whom she had once taken to her
good graces. It must also be confessed that when she had allowed herself to hate either a man
or a woman, she generally hated on to the end. No Paradise could be too charming for her friends;
no Pandemonium too frightful for her enemies. In reference to Mr. Lopez she would have said,
if interrogated, that she had taken the man up in obedience to her husband. But in truth she
had liked the look and the voice of the man. Her husband before now had recommended men to
her notice and kindness, whom at the first trial she had rejected from her good-will, and whom
she had continued to reject ever afterwards, let her husband's urgency be what it might.

Another old friend, of whom former chronicles were not silent, was at the Duchess's that night,
and there came across Mrs. Finn. This was Barrington Erle, a politician of long standing, who
was still looked upon by many as a young man, because he had always been known as a young man,
and because he had never done anything to compromise his position in that respect. He had not
married, or settled himself down in a house of his own, or become subject to gout, or given
up being careful about the fitting of his clothes. No doubt the grey hairs were getting the
better of the black hairs, both on his head and face, and marks of coming crows' feet were
to be seen if you looked close at him, and he had become careful about his great-coat and umbrella.
He was in truth much nearer fifty than forty;--nevertheless he was felt in the House and among
Cabinet Ministers, and among the wives of members and Cabinet Ministers, to be a young man
still. And when he was invited to become Secretary for Ireland it was generally felt that he
was too young for the place. He declined it, however; and when he went to the Post-office,
the gentlemen there all felt that they had had a boy put over them. Phineas Finn, who had become
Secretary for Ireland, was in truth ten years his junior. But Phineas Finn had been twice married,
and had gone through other phases of life, such as make a man old. "How does Phineas like it?"
Erle asked. Phineas Finn and Barrington Erle had gone through some political struggles together,
and had been very intimate.

"I hope not very much," said the lady.

"Why so? Because he's away so much?"

"No;--not that. I should not grudge his absence if the work satisfied him. But I know him so
well. The more he takes to it now,--the more sanguine he is as to some special thing to be
done,--the more bitter will be the disappointment when he is disappointed. For there never
really is anything special to be done;--is there, Mr. Erle?"

"I think there is always a little too much zeal about Finn."

"Of course there is. And then with zeal there always goes a thin skin,--and unjustifiable expectations,
and biting despair, and contempt of others, and all the elements of unhappiness."

"That is a sad programme for your husband."

"He has recuperative faculties which bring him round at last:--but I really doubt whether he
was made for a politician in this country. You remember Lord Brock?"

"Dear old Brock;--of course I do. How should I not, if you remember him?"

"Young men are boys at college, rowing in boats, when women have been ever so long out in the
world. He was the very model of an English statesman. He loved his country dearly, and wished
her to be, as he believed her to be, first among nations. But he had no belief in perpetuating
her greatness by any grand improvements. Let things take their way naturally,--with a slight
direction hither or thither as things might require. That was his method of ruling. He believed
in men rather than measures. As long as he had loyalty around him, he could be personally happy,
and quite confident as to the country. He never broke his heart because he could not carry
this or that reform. What would have hurt him would have been to be worsted in personal conflict.
But he could always hold his own, and he was always happy. Your man with a thin skin, a vehement
ambition, a scrupulous conscience, and a sanguine desire for rapid improvement, is never a
happy, and seldom a fortunate politician."

"Mrs. Finn, you understand it all better than any one else that I ever knew."

"I have been watching it a long time, and of course very closely since I have been married."

"But you have an eye trained to see it all. What a useful member you would have been in a government!"

"But I should never have had patience to sit all night upon that bench in the House of Commons.
How men can do it! They mustn't read. They can't think because of the speaking. It doesn't
do for them to talk. I don't believe they ever listen. It isn't in human nature to listen hour
after hour to such platitudes. I believe they fall into a habit of half-wakeful sleeping, which
carries them through the hours; but even that can't be pleasant. I look upon the Treasury Bench
in July as a sort of casual-ward which we know to be necessary, but is almost too horrid to
be contemplated."

"Men do get bread and skilly there certainly; but, Mrs. Finn, we can go into the library and
smoking-room."

"Oh, yes;--and a clerk in an office can read the newspapers instead of doing his duty. But
there is a certain surveillance exercised, and a certain quantity of work exacted. I have met
Lords of the Treasury out at dinner on Mondays and Thursdays, but we all regard them as boys
who have shirked out of school. I think upon the whole, Mr. Erle, we women have the best of it."

"I don't suppose you will go in for your 'rights'."

"Not by Act of Parliament, or by platform meeting. I have a great idea of a woman's rights;
but that is the way, I think, to throw them away. What do you think of the Duchess's evenings?"

"Lady Glen is in her way as great a woman as you are;--perhaps greater, because nothing ever
stops her."

"Whereas I have scruples."

"Her Grace has none. She has feelings and convictions which keep her straight, but no scruples.
Look at her now talking to Sir Orlando Drought, a man whom she both hates and despises. I am
sure she is looking forward to some happy time in which the Duke may pitch Sir Orlando overboard,
and rule supreme, with me or some other subordinate leading the House of Commons simply as
lieutenant. Such a time will never come, but that is her idea. But she is talking to Sir Orlando
now as if she were pouring her full confidence into his ear, and Sir Orlando is believing her.
Sir Orlando is in a seventh heaven, and she is measuring his credulity inch by inch."

"She makes the place very bright."

"And is spending an enormous deal of money," said Barrington Erle.

"What does it matter?"

"Well, no;--if the Duke likes it. I had an idea that the Duke would not like the display of
the thing. There he is. Do you see him in the corner with his brother duke? He doesn't look
as if he were happy; does he? No one would think he was the master of everything here. He has
got himself hidden almost behind the screen. I'm sure he doesn't like it."

"He tries to like whatever she likes," said Mrs. Finn.

As her husband was away in Ireland, Mrs. Finn was staying in the house in Carlton Gardens.
The Duchess at present required so much of her time that this was found to be convenient. When,
therefore, the guests on the present occasion had all gone, the Duchess and Mrs. Finn were
left together. "Did you ever see anything so hopeless as he is?" said the Duchess.

"Who is hopeless?"

"Heavens and earth! Plantagenet;--who else? Is there another man in the world would come into
his own house, among his own guests, and speak only to one person? And, then, think of it!
Popularity is the staff on which alone Ministers can lean in this country with security."

"Political but not social popularity."

"You know as well as I do that the two go together. We've seen enough of that even in our day.
What broke up Mr. Gresham's Ministry? If he had stayed away people might have thought that
he was reading blue-books, or calculating coinage, or preparing a speech. That would have been
much better. But he comes in and sits for half-an-hour whispering to another duke! I hate dukes!"

"He talks to the Duke of St. Bungay because there is no one he trusts so much. A few years
ago it would have been Mr. Mildmay."

"My dear," said the Duchess angrily, "you treat me as though I were a child. Of course I know
why he chooses that old man out of all the crowd. I don't suppose he does it from any stupid
pride of rank. I know very well what set of ideas govern him. But that isn't the point. He
has to reflect what others think of it, and to endeavour to do what will please them. There
was I telling tarradiddles by the yard to that old oaf, Sir Orlando Drought, when a confidential
word from Plantagenet would have had ten times more effect. And why can't he speak a word to
the people's wives? They wouldn't bite him. He has got to say a few words to you sometimes,--to
whom it doesn't signify, my dear--"

"I don't know about that."

"But he never speaks to another woman. He was here this evening for exactly forty minutes,
and he didn't open his lips to a female creature. I watched him. How on earth am I to pull
him through if he goes on in that way? Yes, Locock, I'll go to bed, and I don't think I'll
get up for a week."

CHAPTER XII

The Gathering of Clouds

Throughout June and the first week of July the affairs of the Ministry went on successfully,
in spite of the social sins of the Duke and the occasional despair of the Duchess. There had
been many politicians who had thought, or had, at any rate, predicted, that the Coalition Ministry
would not live a month. There had been men, such as Lord Fawn on one side and Mr. Boffin on
the other, who had found themselves stranded disagreeably,--with no certain position,--unwilling
to sit immediately behind a Treasury bench from which they were excluded, and too shy to place
themselves immediately opposite. Seats beneath the gangway were, of course, open to such of
them as were members of the Lower House, and those seats had to be used; but they were not
accustomed to sit beneath the gangway. These gentlemen had expected that the seeds of weakness,
of which they had perceived the scattering, would grow at once into an enormous crop of blunders,
difficulties, and complications; but, for a while, the Ministry were saved from these dangers
either by the energy of the Prime Minister, or the popularity of his wife, or perhaps by the
sagacity of the elder Duke;--so that there grew up an idea that the Coalition was really the
proper thing. In one respect it certainly was successful. The Home Rulers, or Irish party generally,
were left without an inch of standing ground. Their support was not needed, and therefore they
were not courted. For the moment there was not even a necessity to pretend that Home Rule was
anything but an absurdity from beginning to end;--so much so that one or two leading Home Rulers,
men who had taken up the cause not only that they might become Members of Parliament, but with
some further ideas of speech-making and popularity, declared that the Coalition had been formed
merely with a view of putting down Ireland. This capability of dispensing with a generally
untractable element of support was felt to be a great comfort. Then, too, there was a set in
the House,--at the moment not a very numerous set,--who had been troublesome friends to the
old Liberal party, and which the Coalition was able, if not to ignore, at any rate to disregard.
These were the staunch economists, and argumentative philosophical Radicals,--men of standing
and repute, who are always in doubtful times individually flattered by Ministers, who have
great privileges accorded to them of speaking and dividing, and who are not unfrequently even
thanked for their rods by the very owners of the backs which bear the scourges. These men could
not be quite set aside by the Coalition as were the Home Rulers. It was not even yet, perhaps,
wise to count them out, or to leave them to talk to benches absolutely empty;--but the tone
of flattery with which they had been addressed became gradually less warm; and when the scourges
were wielded, ministerial backs took themselves out of the way. There grew up unconsciously
a feeling of security against attack which was distasteful to these gentlemen, and was in itself
perhaps a little dangerous. Gentlemen bound to support the Government, when they perceived
that there was comparatively but little to do, and that that little might be easily done, became
careless, and, perhaps, a little contemptuous. So that the great popular orator, Mr. Turnbull,
found himself compelled to rise in his seat, and ask whether the noble Duke at the head of
the Government thought himself strong enough to rule without attention to Parliamentary details.
The question was asked with an air of inexorable severity, and was intended to have deep signification.
Mr. Turnbull had disliked the Coalition from the beginning; but then Mr. Turnbull always disliked
everything. He had so accustomed himself to wield the constitutional cat-of-nine-tails, that
heaven will hardly be happy to him unless he be allowed to flog the cherubim. Though the party
with which he was presumed to act had generally been in power since he had been in the House,
he had never allowed himself to agree with a Minister on any point. And as he had never been
satisfied with a Liberal Government, it was not probable that he should endure a Coalition
in silence. At the end of a rather lengthy speech, he repeated his question, and then sat down,
taking his place with all that constitutional indignation which becomes the parliamentary flagellator
of the day. The little jokes with which Sir Orlando answered him were very well in their way.
Mr. Turnbull did not care much whether he were answered or not. Perhaps the jauntiness of Sir
Orlando, which implied that the Coalition was too strong to regard attack, somewhat irritated
outsiders. But there certainly grew up from that moment a feeling among such men as Erle and
Rattler that care was necessary, that the House, taken as a whole, was not in a condition to
be manipulated with easy freedom, and that Sir Orlando must be made to understand that he was
not strong enough to depend upon jauntiness. The jaunty statesman must be very sure of his
personal following. There was a general opinion that Sir Orlando had not brought the Coalition
well out of the first real attack which had been made upon it.

"Well, Phineas; how do you like the Phoenix?" Phineas Finn had flown back to London at the
instigation probably of Mr. Rattler, and was now standing at the window of Brooks's club with
Barrington Erle. It was near nine one Thursday evening, and they were both about to return
to the House.

"I don't like the Castle, if you mean that."

"Tyrone isn't troublesome, surely?" The Marquis of Tyrone was the Lord Lieutenant of the day,
and had in his time been a very strong Conservative.

"He finds me troublesome, I fear."

"I don't wonder at that, Phineas."

"How should it be otherwise? What can he and I have in sympathy with one another? He has been
brought up with all an Orangeman's hatred for a Papist. Now that he is in high office, he can
abandon the display of the feeling,--perhaps the feeling itself as regards the country at large.
He knows that it doesn't become a Lord Lieutenant to be Orange. But how can he put himself
into a boat with me?"

"All that kind of thing vanishes when a man is in office."

"Yes, as a rule; because men go together into office with the same general predilections. Is
it too hot to walk down?"

"I'll walk a little way,--till you make me hot by arguing."

"I haven't an argument left in me," said Phineas. "Of course everything over there seems easy
enough now,--so easy that Lord Tyrone evidently imagines that the good times are coming back
in which governors may govern and not be governed."

"You are pretty quiet in Ireland now, I suppose;--no martial law, suspension of the habeas
corpus, or anything of that kind, just at present?"

"No; thank goodness!" said Phineas.

"I'm not quite sure whether a general suspension of the habeas corpus would not upon the whole
be the most comfortable state of things for Irishmen themselves. But whether good or bad, you've
nothing of that kind of thing now. You've no great measure that you wish to pass?"

"But they've a great measure that they wish to pass."

"They know better than that. They don't want to kill their golden goose."

"The people, who are infinitely ignorant of all political work, do want it. There are counties
in which, if you were to poll the people, Home Rule would carry nearly every voter,--except
the members themselves."

"You wouldn't give it them?"

"Certainly not;--any more than I would allow a son to ruin himself because he asked me. But
I would endeavour to teach them that they can get nothing by Home Rule,--that their taxes would
be heavier, their property less secure, their lives less safe, their general position more
debased, and their chances of national success more remote than ever."

"You can never teach them, except by the slow lesson of habit. The Heptarchy didn't mould itself
into a nation in a day."

"Men were governed then, and could be and were moulded. I feel sure that even in Ireland there
is a stratum of men, above the working peasants, who would understand, and make those below
them understand, the position of the country, if they could only be got to give up fighting
about religion. Even now Home Rule is regarded by the multitude as a weapon to be used against
Protestantism on behalf of the Pope."

"I suppose the Pope is the great sinner?"

"They got over the Pope in France,--even in early days, before religion had become a farce
in the country. They have done so in Italy."

"Yes;--they've got over the Pope in Italy, certainly."

"And yet," said Phineas, "the bulk of the people are staunch Catholics. Of course the same
attempt to maintain a temporal influence, with the hope of recovering temporal power, is made
in other countries. But while we see the attempt failing elsewhere,--so that we know that the
power of the Church is going to the wall,--yet in Ireland it is infinitely stronger now than
it was fifty, or even twenty years ago."

"Because we have been removing restraints on Papal aggression, while other nations have been
imposing restraints. There are those at Rome who believe all England to be Romish at heart,
because here in England a Roman Catholic can say what he will, and print what he will."

"And yet," said Phineas, "all England does not return one Catholic to the House, while we have
Jews in plenty. You have a Jew among your English judges, but at present not a single Roman
Catholic. What do you suppose are the comparative numbers of the population here in England?"

"And you are going to cure all this;--while Tyrone thinks it ought to be left as it is? I rather
agree with Tyrone."

"No," said Phineas, wearily; "I doubt whether I shall ever cure anything, or even make any
real attempt. My patriotism just goes far enough to make me unhappy, and Lord Tyrone thinks
that while Dublin ladies dance at the Castle, and the list of agrarian murders is kept low,
the country is admirably managed. I don't quite agree with him;--that's all."

Then there arose a legal difficulty, which caused much trouble to the Coalition Ministry. There
fell vacant a certain seat on the bench of judges,--a seat of considerable dignity and importance,
but not quite of the highest rank. Sir Gregory Grogram, who was a rich, energetic man, determined
to have a peerage, and convinced that, should the Coalition fall to pieces, the Liberal element
would be in the ascendant,--so that the woolsack would then be opened to him,--declined to
occupy the place. Sir Timothy Beeswax, the Solicitor-General, saw that it was exactly suited
for him, and had no hesitation in expressing his opinion to that effect. But the place was
not given to Sir Timothy. It was explained to Sir Timothy that the old rule,--or rather custom,--of
offering certain high positions to the law officers of the Crown had been abrogated. Some Prime
Minister, or, more probably, some collection of Cabinet Ministers, had asserted the custom
to be a bad one,--and, as far as right went, Sir Timothy was declared not to have a leg to
stand upon. He was informed that his services in the House were too valuable to be so lost.
Some people said that his temper was against him. Others were of opinion that he had risen
from the ranks too quickly, and that Lord Ramsden, who had come from the same party, thought
that Sir Timothy had not yet won his spurs. The Solicitor-General resigned in a huff, and then
withdrew his resignation. Sir Gregory thought the withdrawal should not be accepted, having
found Sir Timothy to be an unsympathetic colleague. Our Duke consulted the old Duke, among
whose theories of official life forbearance to all colleagues and subordinates was conspicuous.
The withdrawal was, therefore, allowed,--but the Coalition could not after that be said to
be strong in regard to its Law Officers.

But the first concerted attack against the Ministry was made in reference to the budget. Mr.
Monk, who had consented to undertake the duties of Chancellor of the Exchequer under the urgent
entreaties of the two dukes, was of course late with his budget. It was April before the Coalition
had been formed. The budget when produced had been very popular. Budgets, like babies, are
always little loves when first born. But as their infancy passes away, they also become subject
to many stripes. The details are less pleasing than was the whole in the hands of the nurse.
There was a certain "interest," very influential both by general wealth and by the presence
of many members in the House, which thought that Mr. Monk had disregarded its just claims.
Mr. Monk had refused to relieve the Brewers from their licences. Now the Brewers had for some
years been agitating about their licences,--and it is acknowledged in politics that any measure
is to be carried, or to be left out in the cold uncarried and neglected, according to the number
of deputations which may be got to press a Minister on the subject. Now the Brewers had had
deputation after deputation to many Chancellors of the Exchequer; and these deputations had
been most respectable,--we may almost say imperative. It was quite usual for a deputation to
have four or five County members among its body, all Brewers; and the average wealth of a deputation
of Brewers would buy up half London. All the Brewers in the House had been among the supporters
of the Coalition, the number of Liberal and Conservative Brewers having been about equal. But
now there was a fear that the "interest" might put itself into opposition. Mr. Monk had been
firm. More than one of the Ministry had wished to yield;--but he had discussed the matter with
his Chief, and they were both very firm. The Duke had never doubted. Mr. Monk had never doubted.
From day to day certain organs of the Press expressed an opinion, gradually increasing in strength,
that however strong might be the Coalition as a body, it was weak as to finance. This was hard,
because not very many years ago the Duke himself had been known as a particularly strong Minister
of Finance. An amendment was moved in Committee as to the Brewers' Licences, and there was
almost a general opinion that the Coalition would be broken up. Mr. Monk would certainly not
remain in office if the Brewers were to be relieved from their licences.

Then it was that Phineas Finn was recalled from Ireland in red-hot haste. The measure was debated
for a couple of nights, and Mr. Monk carried his point. The Brewers' Licences were allowed
to remain, as one great gentleman from Burton declared, a "disgrace to the fiscal sagacity
of the country." The Coalition was so far victorious;--but there arose a general feeling that
its strength had been impaired.

CHAPTER XIII

Mr. Wharton Complains

"I think you have betrayed me." This accusation was brought by Mr. Wharton against Mrs. Roby
in that lady's drawing-room, and was occasioned by a report that had been made to the old lawyer
by his daughter. He was very angry and almost violent;--so much so that by his manner he gave
a considerable advantage to the lady whom he was accusing.

Mrs. Roby undoubtedly had betrayed her brother-in-law. She had been false to the trust reposed
in her. He had explained his wishes to her in regard to his daughter, to whom she had in some
sort assumed to stand in place of a mother, and she, while pretending to act in accordance
with his wishes, had directly opposed them. But it was not likely that he would be able to
prove her treachery though he might be sure of it. He had desired that his girl should see
as little as possible of Ferdinand Lopez, but had hesitated to give a positive order that she
should not meet him. He had indeed himself taken her to a dinner party at which he knew that
she would meet him. But Mrs. Roby had betrayed him. Since the dinner party she had arranged
a meeting at her own house on behalf of the lover,--as to which arrangement Emily Wharton had
herself been altogether innocent. Emily had met the man in her aunt's house, not expecting
to meet him, and the lover had had an opportunity of speaking his mind freely. She also had
spoken hers freely. She would not engage herself to him without her father's consent. With
that consent she would do so,--oh, so willingly! She did not coy her love. He might be certain
that she would give herself to no one else. Her heart was entirely his. But she had pledged
herself to her father, and on no consideration would she break that pledge. She went on to
say that after what had passed she thought that they had better not meet. In such meetings
there could be no satisfaction, and must be much pain. But he had her full permission to use
any arguments that he could use with her father. On the evening of that day she told her father
all that had passed,--omitting no detail either of what she had said or of what had been said
to her,--adding a positive assurance of obedience, but doing so with a severe solemnity and
apparent consciousness of ill-usage which almost broke her father's heart. "Your aunt must
have had him there on purpose," Mr. Wharton had said. But Emily would neither accuse nor defend
her aunt. "I at least knew nothing of it," she said. "I know that," Mr. Wharton had ejaculated.
"I know that. I don't accuse you of anything, my dear,--except of thinking that you understand
the world better than I do." Then Emily had retired and Mr. Wharton had been left to pass half
the night in a perplexed reverie, feeling that he would be forced ultimately to give way, and
yet certain that by doing so he would endanger his child's happiness.

He was very angry with his sister-in-law, and on the next day, early in the morning, he attacked
her. "I think you have betrayed me," he said.

"What do you mean by that, Mr. Wharton?"

"You have had this man here on purpose that he might make love to Emily."

"I have done no such thing. You told me yourself that they were not to be kept apart. He comes
here, and it would be very odd indeed if I were to tell the servants that he is not to be admitted.
If you want to quarrel with me, of course you can. I have always endeavoured to be a good friend
to Emily."

"It is not being a good friend to her, bringing her and this adventurer together."

"I don't know why you call him an adventurer. But you are so very odd in your ideas! He is
received everywhere, and is always at the Duchess of Omnium's."

"I don't care a fig about the Duchess."

"I dare say not. Only the Duke happens to be Prime Minister, and his house is considered to
have the very best society that England, or indeed Europe, can give. And I think it is something
in a young man's favour when it is known that he associates with such persons as the Duke of
Omnium. I believe that most fathers would have a regard to the company which a man keeps when
they think of their daughter's marrying."

"I ain't thinking of her marrying. I don't want her to marry;--not this man at least. And I
fancy the Duchess of Omnium is just as likely to have scamps in her drawing-room as any other
lady in London."

"And do such men as Mr. Happerton associate with scamps?"

"I don't know anything about Mr. Happerton,--and I don't care anything about him."

"He has £20,000 a year out of his business. And does Everett associate with scamps?"

"Very likely."

"I never knew any one so much prejudiced as you are, Mr. Wharton. When you have a point to
carry there's nothing you won't say. I suppose it comes from being in the courts."

"The long and the short of it is this," said the lawyer; "if I find that Emily is brought here
to meet Mr. Lopez, I must forbid her to come at all."

"You must do as you please about that. But to tell you the truth, Mr. Wharton, I think the
mischief is done. Such a girl as Emily, when she has taken it into her head to love a man,
is not likely to give him up."

"She has promised to have nothing to say to him without my sanction."

"We all know what that means. You'll have to give way. You'll find that it will be so. The
stern parent who dooms his daughter to perpetual seclusion because she won't marry the man
he likes, doesn't belong to this age."

"Who talks about seclusion?"

"Do you suppose that she'll give up the man she loves because you don't like him? Is that the
way girls live now-a-days? She won't run away with him, because she's not one of that sort;
but unless you're harder-hearted than I take you to be, she'll make your life a burden to you.
And as for betraying you, that's nonsense. You've no right to say it. I'm not going to quarrel
with you whatever you may say, but you've no right to say it."

Mr. Wharton, as he went away to Lincoln's Inn, bewailed himself because he knew that he was
not hard-hearted. What his sister-in-law had said to him in that respect was true enough. If
he could only rid himself of a certain internal ague which made him feel that his life was,
indeed, a burden to him while his daughter was unhappy, he need only remain passive and simply
not give the permission without which his daughter would not ever engage herself to this man.
But the ague troubled every hour of his present life. That sister-in-law of his was a silly,
vulgar, worldly, and most untrustworthy woman;--but she had understood what she was saying.

And there had been something in that argument about the Duchess of Omnium's parties, and Mr.
Happerton, which had its effect. If the man did live with the great and wealthy, it must be
because they thought well of him and of his position. The fact of his being a "nasty foreigner,"
and probably of Jewish descent, remained. To him, Wharton, the man must always be distasteful.
But he could hardly maintain his opposition to one of whom the choice spirits of the world
thought well. And he tried to be fair on the subject. It might be that it was a prejudice.
Others probably did not find a man to be odious because he was of foreign extraction and known
by a foreign name. Others would not suspect a man of being of Jewish blood because he was swarthy,
or even object to him if he were a Jew by descent. But it was wonderful to him that his girl
should like such a man,--should like such a man well enough to choose him as the one companion
of her life. She had been brought up to prefer English men, and English thinking, and English
ways,--and English ways, too, somewhat of a past time. He thought as did Brabantio, that it
could not be that without magic his daughter who had shunned--

   "The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
    Of such a thing as"--

this distasteful Portuguese.

That evening he said nothing further to his daughter, but sat with her, silent and disconsolate.
Later in the evening, after she had gone to her room, Everett came in while the old man was
still walking up and down the drawing-room. "Where have you been?" asked the father,--not caring
a straw as to any reply when he asked the question, but roused almost to anger by the answer
when it came.

"I have been dining with Lopez at the club."

"I believe you live with that man."

"Is there any reason, sir, why I should not?"

"You know that there is a good reason why there should be no peculiar intimacy. But I don't
suppose that my wishes, or your sister's welfare, will interest you."

"That is severe, sir."

"I am not such a fool as to suppose that you are to quarrel with a man because I don't approve
his addressing your sister; but I do think that while this is going on, and while he perseveres
in opposition to my distinct refusal, you need not associate with him in any special manner."

"I don't understand your objection to him, sir."

"I dare say not. There are a great many things you don't understand. But I do object."

"He's a very rising man. Mr. Roby was saying to me just now--"

"Who cares a straw what a fool like Roby says?"

"I don't mean Uncle Dick, but his brother,--who, I suppose, is somebody in the world. He was
saying to me just now that he wondered why Lopez does not go into the House;--that he would
be sure to get a seat if he chose, and safe to make a mark when he got there."

"I dare say he could get into the House. I don't know any well-to-do blackguard of whom you
might not predict as much. A seat in the House of Commons doesn't make a man a gentleman as
far as I can see."

"I think every one allows that Ferdinand Lopez is a gentleman."

"Who was his father?"

"I didn't happen to know him, sir."

"And who was his mother? I don't suppose you will credit anything because I say it, but as
far as my experience goes, a man doesn't often become a gentleman in the first generation.
A man may be very worthy, very clever, very rich,--very well worth knowing, if you will;--but
when one talks of admitting a man into close family communion by marriage, one would, I fancy,
wish to know something of his father and mother." Then Everett escaped, and Mr. Wharton was
again left to his own meditations. Oh, what a peril, what a trouble, what a labyrinth of difficulties
was a daughter! He must either be known as a stern, hard-hearted parent, utterly indifferent
to his child's feelings, using with tyranny the power over her which came to him only from
her sense of filial duty,--or else he must give up his own judgment, and yield to her in a
matter as to which he believed that such yielding would be most pernicious to her own interests.

Hitherto he really knew nothing of the man's means;--nor, if he could have his own way, did
he want such information. But, as things were going now, he began to feel that if he could
hear anything averse to the man he might thus strengthen his hands against him. On the following
day he went into the city, and called on an old friend, a banker,--one whom he had known for
nearly half a century, and of whom, therefore, he was not afraid to ask a question. For Mr.
Wharton was a man not prone, in the ordinary intercourse of life, either to ask or to answer
questions. "You don't know anything, do you, of a man named Ferdinand Lopez?"

"I have heard of him. But why do you ask?"

"Well; I have a reason for asking. I don't know that I quite wish to say what my reason is."

"I have heard of him as connected with Hunky's house," said the banker,--"or rather with one
of the partners in the house."

"Is he a man of means?"

"I imagine him to be so;--but I know nothing. He has rather large dealings, I take it, in foreign
stocks. Is he after my old friend, Miss Wharton?"

"Well;--yes."

"You had better get more information than I can give you. But, of course, before anything of
that kind was done you would see that money was settled." This was all he heard in the city,
and this was not satisfactory. He had not liked to tell his friend that he wished to hear that
the foreigner was a needy adventurer,--altogether untrustworthy; but that had really been his
desire. Then he thought of the £60,000 which he himself destined for his girl. If the man were
to his liking there would be money enough. Though he had been careful to save money, he was
not a greedy man, even for his children. Should his daughter insist on marrying this man he
could take care that she should never want a sufficient income.

As a first step,--a thing to be done almost at once,--he must take her away from London. It
was now July, and the custom of the family was that the house in Manchester Square should be
left for two months, and that the flitting should take place about the middle of August. Mr.
Wharton usually liked to postpone the flitting, as he also liked to hasten the return. But
now it was a question whether he had not better start at once,--start somewhither, and probably
for a much longer period than the usual vacation. Should he take the bull by the horns, and
declare his purpose of living for the next twelvemonth at--; well, it did not much matter where;
Dresden, he thought, was a long way off, and would do as well as any place. Then it occurred
to him that his cousin, Sir Alured, was in town, and that he had better see his cousin before
he came to any decision. They were, as usual, expected at Wharton Hall this autumn, and that
arrangement could not be abandoned without explanation.

Sir Alured Wharton was a baronet, with a handsome old family place on the Wye in Herefordshire,
whose forefathers had been baronets since baronets were first created, and whose earlier forefathers
had lived at Wharton Hall much before that time. It may be imagined, therefore, that Sir Alured
was proud of his name, of his estate, and of his rank. But there were drawbacks to his happiness.
As regarded his name, it was to descend to a nephew whom he specially disliked,--and with good
cause. As to his estate, delightful as it was in many respects, it was hardly sufficient to
maintain his position with that plentiful hospitality which he would have loved;--and other
property he had none. And as to his rank, he had almost become ashamed of it, since,--as he
was wont to declare was now the case,--every prosperous tallow-chandler throughout the country
was made a baronet as a matter of course. So he lived at home through the year with his wife
and daughters, not pretending to the luxury of a season in London for which his modest three
or four thousand a year did not suffice;--and so living, apart from all the friction of clubs,
parliaments, and mixed society, he did veritably believe that his dear country was going utterly
to the dogs. He was so staunch in politics, that during the doings of the last quarter of a
century,--from the repeal of the Corn Laws down to the Ballot,--he had honestly declared one
side to be as bad as the other. Thus he felt that all his happiness was to be drawn from the
past. There was nothing of joy or glory to which he could look forward either on behalf of
his country or his family. His nephew,--and alas, his heir,--was a needy spendthrift, with
whom he would hold no communication. The family settlement for his wife and daughters would
leave them but poorly off; and though he did struggle to save something, the duty of living
as Sir Alured Wharton of Wharton Hall should live made those struggles very ineffective. He
was a melancholy, proud, ignorant man, who could not endure a personal liberty, and who thought
the assertion of social equality on the part of men of lower rank to amount to the taking of
personal liberty;--who read little or nothing, and thought that he knew the history of his
country because he was aware that Charles I had had his head cut off, and that the Georges
had come from Hanover. If Charles I had never had his head cut off, and if the Georges had
never come from Hanover, the Whartons would now probably be great people and Britain a great
nation. But the Evil One had been allowed to prevail, and everything had gone astray, and Sir
Alured now had nothing of this world to console him but a hazy retrospect of past glories,
and a delight in the beauty of his own river, his own park, and his own house. Sir Alured,
with all his foibles and with all his faults, was a pure-minded, simple gentleman, who could
not tell a lie, who could not do a wrong, and who was earnest in his desire to make those who
were dependent on him comfortable, and, if possible, happy. Once a year he came up to London
for a week, to see his lawyers, and get measured for a coat, and go to the dentist. These were
the excuses which he gave, but it was fancied by some that his wig was the great moving cause.
Sir Alured and Mr. Wharton were second cousins, and close friends. Sir Alured trusted his cousin
altogether in all things, believing him to be the great legal luminary of Great Britain, and
Mr. Wharton returned his cousin's affection, entertaining something akin to reverence for the
man who was the head of his family. He dearly loved Sir Alured,--and loved Sir Alured's wife
and two daughters. Nevertheless, the second week at Wharton Hall became always tedious to him,
and the fourth, fifth, and sixth weeks frightful with ennui.

Perhaps it was with some unconscious dread of this tedium that he made a sudden suggestion
to Sir Alured in reference to Dresden. Sir Alured had come to him at his chambers, and the
two old men were sitting together near the open window. Sir Alured delighted in the privilege
of sitting there, which seemed to confer upon him something of an insight into the inner ways
of London life beyond what he could get at his hotel or his wigmaker's. "Go to Dresden;--for
the winter!" he exclaimed.

"Not only for the winter. We should go at once."

"Not before you come to Wharton!" said the amazed baronet.

Mr. Wharton replied in a low, sad voice, "In that case we should not go down to Herefordshire
at all." The baronet looked hurt as well as unhappy. "Yes, I know what you will say, and how
kind you are."

"It isn't kindness at all. You always come. It would be breaking up everything."

"Everything has to be broken up sooner or later. One feels that as one grows older."

"You and I, Abel, are just of an age. Why should you talk to me like this? You are strong enough,
whatever I am. Why shouldn't you come? Dresden! I never heard of such a thing. I suppose it's
some nonsense of Emily's."

Then Mr. Wharton told his whole story. "Nonsense of Emily's!" he began. "Yes, it is nonsense,--worse
than you think. But she doesn't want to go abroad." The father's plaint needn't be repeated
to the reader as it was told to the baronet. Though it was necessary that he should explain
himself, yet he tried to be reticent. Sir Alured listened in silence. He loved his cousin Emily,
and, knowing that she would be rich, knowing her advantages of birth, and recognizing her beauty,
had expected that she would make a match creditable to the Wharton family. But a Portuguese
Jew! A man who had never been even known to allude to his own father! For by degrees Mr. Wharton
had been driven to confess all the sins of the lover, though he had endeavoured to conceal
the extent of his daughter's love.

"Do you mean that Emily--favours him?"

"I am afraid so."

"And would she--would she--do anything without your sanction?" He was always thinking of the
disgrace attaching to himself by reason of his nephew's vileness, and now, if a daughter of
the family should also go astray, so as to be exiled from the bosom of the Whartons, how manifest
would it be that all the glory was departing from their house!

"No! She will do nothing without my sanction. She has given her word,--which is gospel." As
he spoke the old lawyer struck his hand upon the table.

"Then why should you run away to Dresden?"

"Because she is unhappy. She will not marry him,--or even see him, if I forbid it. But she
is near him."

"Herefordshire is a long way off," said the baronet, pleading.

"Change of scene is what she should have," said the father.

"There can't be more of a change than she'd get at Wharton. She always did like Wharton. It
was there that she met Arthur Fletcher." The father only shook his head as Arthur Fletcher's
name was mentioned. "Well,--that is sad. I always thought she'd give way about Arthur at last."

"It is impossible to understand a young woman," said the lawyer. With such an English gentleman
as Arthur Fletcher on one side, and with this Portuguese Jew on the other, it was to him Hyperion
to a Satyr. A darkness had fallen over his girl's eyes, and for a time her power of judgment
had left her.

"But I don't see why Wharton should not do just as well as Dresden," continued the baronet.
Mr. Wharton found himself quite unable to make his cousin understand that the greater disruption
caused by a residence abroad, the feeling that a new kind of life had been considered necessary
for her, and that she must submit to the new kind of life, might be gradually effective, while
the journeyings and scenes which had been common to her year after year would have no effect.
Nevertheless he gave way. They could hardly start to Germany at once, but the visit to Wharton
might be accelerated; and the details of the residence abroad might be there arranged. It was
fixed, therefore, that Mr. Wharton and Emily should go down to Wharton Hall at any rate before
the end of July.

"Why do you go earlier than usual, papa?" Emily asked him afterwards.

"Because I think it best," he replied angrily. She ought at any rate to understand the reason.

"Of course I shall be ready, papa. You know that I always like Wharton. There is no place on
earth I like so much, and this year it will be especially pleasant to me to go out of town. But--"

"But what?"

"I can't bear to think that I shall be taking you away."

"I've got to bear worse things than that, my dear."

"Oh, papa, do not speak to me like that! Of course I know what you mean. There is no real reason
for your going. If you wish it I will promise you that I will not see him." He only shook his
head,--meaning to imply that a promise which could go no farther than that would not make him
happy. "It will be just the same, papa,--either here, or at Wharton, or elsewhere. You need
not be afraid of me."

"I am not afraid of you;--but I am afraid for you. I fear for your happiness,--and for my own."

"So do I, papa. But what can be done? I suppose sometimes people must be unhappy. I can't change
myself, and I can't change you. I find myself to be as much bound to Mr. Lopez as though I
were his wife."

"No, no! you shouldn't say so. You've no right to say so."

"But I have given you a promise, and I certainly will keep it. If we must be unhappy, still
we need not,--need not quarrel; need we, papa?" Then she came up to him and kissed him,--whereupon
he went out of the room wiping his eyes.

That evening he again spoke to her, saying merely a word. "I think, my dear, we'll have it
fixed that we go on the 30th. Sir Alured seemed to wish it."

"Very well, papa;--I shall be quite ready."

CHAPTER XIV

A Lover's Perseverance

Ferdinand Lopez learned immediately through Mrs. Roby that the early departure for Herefordshire
had been fixed. "I should go to him and speak to him very plainly," said Mrs. Roby. "He can't
bite you."

"I'm not in the least afraid of his biting me."

"You can talk so well! I should tell him everything, especially about money,--which I'm sure
is all right."

"Yes,--that is all right," said Lopez, smiling.

"And about your people."

"Which I've no doubt you think is all wrong."

"I don't know anything about it," said Mrs. Roby, "and I don't much care. He has old-world
notions. At any rate you should say something, so that he should not be able to complain to
her that you had kept him in the dark. If there is anything to be known, it's much better to
have it known."

"But there is nothing to be known."

"Then tell him nothing;--but still tell it to him. After that you must trust to her. I don't
suppose she'd go off with you."

"I'm sure she wouldn't."

"But she's as obstinate as a mule. She'll get the better of him if you really mean it." He
assured her that he really did mean it, and determined that he would take her advice as to
seeing, or endeavouring to see, Mr. Wharton once again. But before doing so he thought it to
be expedient to put his house into order, so that he might be able to make a statement of his
affairs if asked to do so. Whether they were flourishing or the reverse, it might be necessary
that he should have to speak of them,--with, at any rate, apparent candour.

The reader may, perhaps, remember that in the month of April Ferdinand Lopez had managed to
extract a certain signature from his unfortunate city friend, Sexty Parker, which made that
gentleman responsible for the payment of a considerable sum of money before the end of July.
The transaction had been one of an unmixed painful nature to Mr. Parker. As soon as he came
to think of it, after Lopez had left him, he could not prevail upon himself to forgive himself
for his folly. That he,--he, Sextus Parker,--should have been induced by a few empty words
to give his name for seven hundred and fifty pounds without any consideration or possibility
of benefit! And the more he thought of it the more sure he was that the money was lost. The
next day he confirmed his own fears, and before a week was gone he had written down the sum
as gone. He told nobody. He did not like to confess his folly. But he made some inquiry about
his friend,--which was absolutely futile. No one that he knew seemed to know anything of the
man's affairs. But he saw his friend from time to time in the city, shining as only successful
men do shine, and he heard of him as one whose name was becoming known in the city. Still he
suffered grievously. His money was surely gone. A man does not fly a kite in that fashion till
things with him have reached a bad pass.

So it was with Mr. Parker all through May and to the end of June,--the load ever growing heavier
and heavier as the time became nearer. Then, while he was still afflicted with a heaviness
of spirits which had never left him since that fatal day, who but Ferdinand Lopez should walk
into his office, wearing the gayest smile and with a hat splendid as hats are splendid only
in the city. And nothing could be more "jolly" than his friend's manner,--so much so that Sexty
was almost lifted up into temporary jollity himself. Lopez, seating himself, almost at once
began to describe a certain speculation into which he was going rather deeply, and as to which
he invited his friend Parker's co-operation. He was intending, evidently, not to ask, but to
confer, a favour.

"I rather think that steady business is best," said Parker. "I hope it's all right about that
£750."

"Ah; yes;--I meant to have told you. I didn't want the money, as it turned out, for much above
a fortnight, and as there was no use in letting the bill run out, I settled it." So saying
he took out a pocket-book, extracted the bill, and showed it to Sexty. Sexty's heart fluttered
in his bosom. There was his name still on the bit of paper, and it might still be used. Having
it shown to him after this fashion in its mid career, of course he had strong ground for hope.
But he could not bring himself to put out his hand for it. "As to what you say about steady
business, of course that's very well," said Lopez. "It depends upon whether a man wants to
make a small income or a large fortune." He still held the bill as though he were going to
fold it up again, and the importance of it was so present to Sexty's mind that he could hardly
digest the argument about the steady business. "I own that I am not satisfied with the former,"
continued Lopez, "and that I go in for the fortune." As he spoke he tore the bill into three
or four bits, apparently without thinking of it, and let the fragments fall upon the floor.
It was as though a mountain had been taken off Sexty's bosom. He felt almost inclined to send
out for a bottle of champagne on the moment, and the arguments of his friend rang in his ears
with quite a different sound. The allurements of a steady income paled before his eyes, and
he too began to tell himself, as he had often told himself before, that if he would only keep
his eyes open and his heart high there was no reason why he too should not become a city millionaire.
But on that occasion Lopez left him soon, without saying very much about his favourite speculation.
In a few days, however, the same matter was brought before Sexty's eyes from another direction.
He learned from a side wind that the house of Hunky and Sons was concerned largely in this
business,--or at any rate he thought that he had so learned. The ease with which Lopez had
destroyed that bill six weeks before it was due had had great effect upon him. Those arguments
about a large fortune or a small income still clung to him. Lopez had come to him about the
business in the first instance, but it was now necessary that he should go to Lopez. He was,
however, very cautious. He managed to happen to meet Lopez in the street, and introduced the
subject in his own slap-dash, aery manner,--the result of which was, that he had gone rather
deep into two or three American mines before the end of July. But he had already made some
money out of them, and, though he would find himself sometimes trembling before he had taken
his daily allowance of port wine and brandy-and-water, still he was buoyant, and hopeful of
living in a park, with a palace at the West End, and a seat in Parliament. Knowing also, as
he did, that his friend Lopez was intimate with the Duchess of Omnium, he had much immediate
satisfaction in the intimacy which these relations created. He was getting in the thin edge
of the wedge, and would calculate as he went home to Ponder's End how long it must be before
he could ask his friend to propose him at some West End club. On one halcyon summer evening
Lopez had dined with him at Ponder's End, had smiled on Mrs. Parker, and played with the hopeful
little Parkers. On that occasion Sexty had assured his wife that he regarded his friendship
with Ferdinand Lopez as the most fortunate circumstance of his life. "Do be careful, Sexty,"
the poor woman had said. But Parker had simply told her that she understood nothing about business.
On that evening Lopez had thoroughly imbued him with the conviction that if you will only set
your mind that way, it is quite as easy to amass a large fortune as to earn a small income.

About a week before the departure of the Whartons for Herefordshire, Lopez, in compliance with
Mrs. Roby's counsels, called at the chambers in Stone Buildings. It is difficult to say that
you will not see a man, when the man is standing just on the other side of an open door;--nor,
in this case, was Mr. Wharton quite clear that he had better decline to see the man. But while
he was doubting,--at any rate before he had resolved upon denying his presence,--the man was
there, inside his room. Mr. Wharton got up from his chair, hesitated a moment, and then gave
his hand to the intruder in that half-unwilling, unsatisfactory manner which most of us have
experienced when shaking hands with some cold-blooded, ungenial acquaintance. "Well, Mr. Lopez,--what
can I do for you?" he said, as he reseated himself. He looked as though he were at his ease
and master of the situation. He had control over himself sufficient for assuming such a manner.
But his heart was not high within his bosom. The more he looked at the man the less he liked him.

"There is one thing, and one thing only, you can do for me," said Lopez. His voice was peculiarly
sweet, and when he spoke his words seemed to mean more than when they came from other mouths.
But Mr. Wharton did not like sweet voices and mellow, soft words,--at least not from men's mouths.

"I do not think that I can do anything for you, Mr. Lopez," he said. There was a slight pause,
during which the visitor put down his hat and seemed to hesitate. "I think your coming here
can be of no avail. Did I not explain myself when I saw you before?"

"But, I fear, I did not explain myself. I hardly told my story."

"You can tell it, of course,--if you think the telling will do you any good."

"I was not able to say then, as I can say now, that your daughter has accepted my love."

"You ought not to have spoken to my daughter on the subject after what passed between us. I
told you my mind frankly."

"Ah, Mr. Wharton, how was obedience in such a matter possible? What would you yourself think
of a man who in such a position would be obedient? I did not seek her secretly. I did nothing
underhand. Before I had once directly asked her for her love, I came to you."

"What's the use of that, if you go to her immediately afterwards in manifest opposition to
my wishes? You found yourself bound, as would any gentleman, to ask a father's leave, and when
it was refused, you went on just as though it had been granted! Don't you call that a mockery?"

"I can say now, sir, what I could not say then. We love each other. And I am as sure of her
as I am of myself when I assert that we shall be true to each other. You must know her well
enough to be sure of that also."

"I am sure of nothing but of this;--that I will not give her my consent to become your wife."

"What is your objection, Mr. Wharton?"

"I explained it before as far as I found myself called upon to explain it."

"Are we both to be sacrificed for some reason that we neither of us understand?"

"How dare you take upon yourself to say that she doesn't understand! Because I refuse to be
more explicit to you, a stranger, do you suppose that I am equally silent to my own child?"

"In regard to money and social rank I am able to place your daughter as my wife in a position
as good as she now holds as Miss Wharton."

"I care nothing about money, Mr. Lopez, and our ideas of social rank are perhaps different.
I have nothing further to say to you, and I do not think that you can have anything further
to say to me that can be of any avail." Then, having finished his speech, he got up from his
chair and stood upright, thereby demanding of his visitor that he should depart.

"I think it no more than honest, Mr. Wharton, to declare this one thing. I regard myself as
irrevocably engaged to your daughter; and she, although she has refused to bind herself to
me by that special word, is, I am certain, as firmly fixed in her choice as I am in mine. My
happiness, as a matter of course, can be nothing to you."

"Not much," said the lawyer, with angry impatience.

Lopez smiled, but he put down the word in his memory and determined that he would treasure
it there. "Not much, at any rate as yet," he said. "But her happiness must be much to you."

"It is everything. That little one run again but springer. Why the rooms had not be keep us is again he will

Act, Who was
to camcorder, with "Fred," "Crowbar"

 I have refused my sanction to the marriage
both to him and to her,--though in truth I have been hard set to find any adequate reason for
doing so. I have no right to fashion my girl's life by my prejudices. My life has been lived.
Hers is to come. In this matter I should be cruel and unnatural were I to allow myself to be
governed by any selfish inclination. Though I were to know that she would be lost to me for
ever, I must give way,--if once brought to a conviction that by not giving way I should sacrifice
her young happiness. In this matter, Arthur, I must not even think of you, though I love you
well. I must consider only my child's welfare;--and in doing so I must try to sift my own feelings
and my own judgment, and ascertain, if it be possible, whether my distaste to the man is reasonable
or irrational;--whether I should serve her or sacrifice her by obstinacy of refusal. I can
speak to you more plainly than to her. Indeed I have laid bare to you my whole heart and my
whole mind. You have all my wishes, but you will understand that I do not promise you my continued
assistance." When he had so spoken he put out his hand and pressed his companion's arm. Then
he turned slowly into a little by-path which led across the park up to the house, and left
Arthur Fletcher standing alone by the river's bank.

And so by degrees the blow had come full home to him. He had been twice refused. Then rumours
had reached him,--not at first that he had a rival, but that there was a man who might possibly
become so. And now this rivalry, and its success, were declared to him plainly. He told himself
from this moment that he had not a chance. Looking forward he could see it all. He understood
the girl's character sufficiently to be sure that she would not be wafted about, from one lover
to another, by change of scene. Taking her to Dresden,--or to New Zealand,--would only confirm
in her passion such a girl as Emily Wharton. Nothing could shake her but the ascertained unworthiness
of the man,--and not that unless it were ascertained beneath her own eyes. And then years must
pass by before she would yield to another lover. There was a further question, too, which he
did not fail to ask himself. Was the man necessarily unworthy because his name was Lopez, and
because he had not come of English blood?

As he strove to think of this, if not coolly yet rationally, he sat himself down on the river's
side and began to pitch stones off the path in among the rocks, among which at that spot the
water made its way rapidly. There had been moments in which he had been almost ashamed of his
love,--and now he did not know whether to be most ashamed or most proud of it. But he recognised
the fact that it was crucifying him, and that it would continue to crucify him. He knew himself
in London to be a popular man,--one of those for whom, according to general opinion, girls
should sigh, rather than one who should break his heart sighing for a girl. He had often told
himself that it was beneath his manliness to be despondent; that he should let such a trouble
run from him like water from a duck's back, consoling himself with the reflection that if the
girl had such bad taste she could hardly be worthy of him. He had almost tried to belong to
that school which throws the heart away and rules by the head alone. He knew that others,--perhaps
not those who knew him best, but who nevertheless were the companions of many of his hours,--gave
him the credit for such power. Why should a man afflict himself by the inward burden of an
unsatisfied craving, and allow his heart to sink into his very feet because a girl would not
smile when he wooed her? "If she be not fair for me, what care I how fair she be!" He had repeated
the lines to himself a score of times, and had been ashamed of himself because he could not
make them come true to himself.

They had not come true in the least. There he was, Arthur Fletcher, whom all the world courted,
with his heart in his very boots! There was a miserable load within him, absolutely palpable
to his outward feeling,--a very physical pain,--which he could not shake off. As he threw the
stones into the water he told himself that it must be so with him always. Though the world
did pet him, though he was liked at his club, and courted in the hunting-field, and loved at
balls and archery meetings, and reputed by old men to be a rising star, he told himself that
he was so maimed and mutilated as to be only half a man. He could not reason about it. Nature
had afflicted him with a certain weakness. One man has a hump;--another can hardly see out
of his imperfect eyes;--a third can barely utter a few disjointed words. It was his fate to
be constructed with some weak arrangement of the blood-vessels which left him in this plight.
"The whole damned thing is nothing to me," he said bursting out into absolute tears, after
vainly trying to reassure himself by a recollection of the good things which the world still
had in store for him.

Then he strove to console himself by thinking that he might take a pride in his love even though
it were so intolerable a burden to him. Was it not something to be able to love as he loved?
Was it not something at any rate that she to whom he had condescended to stoop was worthy of
all love? But even here he could get no comfort,--being in truth unable to see very clearly
into the condition of the thing. It was a disgrace to him,--to him within his own bosom,--that
she should have preferred to him such a one as Ferdinand Lopez, and this disgrace he exaggerated,
ignoring the fact that the girl herself might be deficient in judgment, or led away in her
love by falsehood and counterfeit attractions. To him she was such a goddess that she must
be right,--and therefore his own inferiority to such a one as Ferdinand Lopez was proved. He
could take no pride in his rejected love. He would rid himself of it at a moment's notice if
he knew the way. He would throw himself at the feet of some second-rate, tawdry, well-born,
well-known beauty of the day,--only that there was not now left to him strength to pretend
the feeling that would be necessary. Then he heard steps, and jumping up from his seat, stood
just in the way of Emily Wharton and her cousin Mary. "Ain't you going to dress for dinner,
young man?" said the latter.

"I shall have time if you have, any way," said Arthur, endeavouring to pluck up his spirits.

"That's nice of him;--isn't it?" said Mary. "Why, we are dressed. What more do you want? We
came out to look for you, though we didn't mean to come as far as this. It's past seven now,
and we are supposed to dine at a quarter past."

"Five minutes will do for me."

"But you've got to get to the house. You needn't be in a tremendous hurry, because papa has
only just come in from haymaking. They've got up the last load, and there has been the usual
ceremony. Emily and I have been looking at them."

"I wish I'd been here all the time," said Emily. "I do so hate London in July."

"So do I," said Arthur,--"in July and all other times."

"You hate London!" said Mary.

"Yes,--and Herefordshire,--and other places generally. If I've got to dress I'd better get
across the park as quick as I can go," and so he left them. Mary turned round and looked at
her cousin, but at the moment said nothing. Arthur's passion was well known to Mary Wharton,
but Mary had as yet heard nothing of Ferdinand Lopez.

CHAPTER XVI

Never Run Away!

During the whole of that evening there was a forced attempt on the part of all the party at
Wharton Hall to be merry,--which, however, as is the case whenever such attempts are forced,
was a failure. There had been a hay-making harvest-home which was supposed to give the special
occasion for mirth, as Sir Alured farmed the land around the park himself, and was great in
hay. "I don't think it pays very well," he said with a gentle smile, "but I like to employ
some of the people myself. I think the old people find it easier with me than with the tenants."

"I shouldn't wonder," said his cousin;--"but that's charity; not employment."

"No, no," exclaimed the baronet. "They work for their wages and do their best. Powell sees
to that." Powell was the bailiff, who knew the length of his master's foot to a quarter of
an inch, and was quite aware that the Wharton haymakers were not to be overtasked. "Powell
doesn't keep any cats about the place, but what catch mice. But I am not quite sure that haymaking
does pay."

"How do the tenants manage?"

"Of course they look to things closer. You wouldn't wish me to let the land up to the house door."

"I think," said old Mrs. Fletcher, "that a landlord should consent to lose a little by his
own farming. It does good in the long run." Both Mr. Wharton and Sir Alured felt that this
might be very well at Longbarns, though it could hardly be afforded at Wharton.

"I don't think I lose much by my farming," said the squire of Longbarns. "I have about four
hundred acres on hand, and I keep my accounts pretty regularly."

"Johnson is a very good man, I dare say," said the baronet.

"Like most of the others," continued the squire, "he's very well as long as he's looked after.
I think I know as much about it as Johnson. Of course, I don't expect a farmer's profit; but
I do expect my rent, and I get it."

"I don't think I manage it quite that way," said the baronet in a melancholy tone.

"I'm afraid not," said the barrister.

"John is as hard upon the men as any one of the tenants," said John's wife, Mrs. Fletcher of
Longbarns.

"I'm not hard at all," said John, "and you understand nothing about it. I'm paying three shillings
a week more to every man, and eighteen pence a week more to every woman, than I did three years
ago."

"That's because of the Unions," said the barrister.

"I don't care a straw for the Unions. If the Unions interfered with my comfort I'd let the
land and leave the place."

"Oh, John!" ejaculated John's mother.

"I would not consent to be made a slave even for the sake of the country. But the wages had
to be raised,--and having raised them I expect to get proper value for my money. If anything
has to be given away, let it be given away,--so that the people should know what it is that
they receive."

"That's just what we don't want to do here," said Lady Wharton, who did not often join in any
of these arguments.

"You're wrong, my lady," said her stepson. "You're only breeding idleness when you teach people
to think that they are earning wages without working for their money. Whatever you do with
'em let 'em know and feel the truth. It'll be the best in the long run."

"I'm sometimes happy when I think that I shan't live to see the long run," said the baronet.
This was the manner in which they tried to be merry that evening after dinner at Wharton Hall.
The two girls sat listening to their seniors in contented silence,--listening or perhaps thinking
of their own peculiar troubles, while Arthur Fletcher held some book in his hand which he strove
to read with all his might.

There was not one there in the room who did not know that it was the wish of the united families
that Arthur Fletcher should marry Emily Wharton, and also that Emily had refused him. To Arthur
of course the feeling that it was so could not but be an additional vexation; but the knowledge
had grown up and had become common in the two families without any power on his part to prevent
so disagreeable a condition of affairs. There was not one in that room, unless it was Mary
Wharton, who was not more or less angry with Emily, thinking her to be perverse and unreasonable.
Even to Mary her cousin's strange obstinacy was matter of surprise and sorrow,--for to her
Arthur Fletcher was one of those demigods, who should never be refused, who are not expected
to do more than express a wish and be accepted. Her own heart had not strayed that way because
she thought but little of herself, knowing herself to be portionless, and believing from long
thought on the subject that it was not her destiny to be the wife of any man. She regarded
Arthur Fletcher as being of all men the most lovable,--though, knowing her own condition, she
did not dream of loving him. It did not become her to be angry with another girl on such a
cause;--but she was amazed that Arthur Fletcher should sigh in vain.

The girl's folly and perverseness on this head were known to them all,--but as yet her greater
folly and worse perverseness, her vitiated taste and dreadful partiality for the Portuguese
adventurer, were known but to the two old men and to poor Arthur himself. When that sternly
magnificent old lady, Mrs. Fletcher,--whose ancestors had been Welsh kings in the time of the
Romans,--when she should hear this story, the roof of the old hall would hardly be able to
hold her wrath and her dismay! The old kings had died away, but the Fletchers, and the Vaughans,--of
whom she had been one,--and the Whartons remained, a peculiar people in an age that was then
surrendering itself to quick perdition, and with peculiar duties. Among these duties, the chiefest
of them incumbent on females was that of so restraining their affections that they should never
damage the good cause by leaving it. They might marry within the pale,--or remain single, as
might be their lot. She would not take upon herself to say that Emily Wharton was bound to
accept Arthur Fletcher, merely because such a marriage was fitting,--although she did think
that there was much perverseness in the girl, who might have taught herself, had she not been
stubborn, to comply with the wishes of the families. But to love one below herself, a man without
a father, a foreigner, a black Portuguese nameless Jew, merely because he had a bright eye,
and a hook nose, and a glib tongue,--that a girl from the Whartons should do this--! It was
so unnatural to Mrs. Fletcher that it would be hardly possible to her to be civil to the girl
after she had heard that her mind and taste were so astray. All this Sir Alured knew and the
barrister knew it,--and they feared her indignation the more because they sympathised with
the old lady's feelings.

"Emily Wharton doesn't seem to me to be a bit more gracious than she used to be," Mrs. Fletcher
said to Lady Wharton that night. The two old ladies were sitting together upstairs, and Mrs.
John Fletcher was with them. In such conferences Mrs. Fletcher always domineered,--to the perfect
contentment of old Lady Wharton, but not equally so to that of her daughter-in-law.

"I'm afraid she is not very happy," said Lady Wharton.

"She has everything that ought to make a girl happy, and I don't know what it is she wants.
It makes me quite angry to see her so discontented. She doesn't say a word, but sits there
as glum as death. If I were Arthur I would leave her for six months, and never speak to her
during the time."

"I suppose, mother," said the younger Mrs. Fletcher,--who called her husband's mother, mother,
and her own mother, mamma,--"a girl needn't marry a man unless she likes him."

"But she should try to like him if it is suitable in other respects. I don't mean to take any
trouble about it. Arthur needn't beg for any favour. Only I wouldn't have come here if I had
thought that she had intended to sit silent like that always."

"It makes her unhappy, I suppose," said Lady Wharton, "because she can't do what we all want."

"Fall, lall! She'd have wanted it herself if nobody else had wished it. I'm surprised that
Arthur should be so much taken with her."

"You'd better say nothing more about it, mother."

"I don't mean to say anything more about it. It's nothing to me. Arthur can do very well in
the world without Emily Wharton. Only a girl like that will sometimes make a disgraceful match;
and we should all feel that."

"I don't think Emily will do anything disgraceful," said Lady Wharton. And so they parted.

In the meantime the two brothers were smoking their pipes in the housekeeper's room, which,
at Wharton, when the Fletchers or Everett were there, was freely used for that purpose.

"Isn't it rather quaint of you," said the elder brother, "coming down here in the middle of
term time?"

"It doesn't matter much."

"I should have thought it would matter;--that is, if you mean to go on with it."

"I'm not going to make a slave of myself about it, if you mean that. I don't suppose I shall
ever marry,--and as for rising to be a swell in the profession, I don't care about it."

"You used to care about it,--very much. You used to say that if you didn't get to the top it
shouldn't be your own fault."

"And I have worked;--and I do work. But things get changed somehow. I've half a mind to give
it all up,--to raise a lot of money, and to start off with a resolution to see every corner
of the world. I suppose a man could do it in about thirty years if he lived so long. It's the
kind of thing would suit me."

"Exactly. I don't know any fellow who has been more into society, and therefore you are exactly
the man to live alone for the rest of your life. You've always worked hard, I will say that
for you;--and therefore you're just the man to be contented with idleness. You've always been
ambitious and self-confident, and therefore it will suit you to a T, to be nobody and to do
nothing." Arthur sat silent, smoking his pipe with all his might, and his brother continued,--"Besides,--you
read sometimes, I fancy."

"I should read all the more."

"Very likely. But what you have read, in the old plays, for instance, must have taught you
that when a man is cut up about a woman,--which I suppose is your case just at present,--he
never does get over it. He never gets all right after a time,--does he? Such a one had better
go and turn monk at once, as the world is over for him altogether;--isn't it? Men don't recover
after a month or two, and go on just the same. You've never seen that kind of thing yourself?"

"I'm not going to cut my throat or turn monk either."

"No. There are so many steamboats and railways now that travelling seems easier. Suppose you
go as far as St. Petersburg, and see if that does you any good. If it don't, you needn't go
on, because it will be hopeless. If it does,--why, you can come back, because the second journey
will do the rest."

"There never was anything, John, that wasn't matter for chaff with you."

"And I hope there never will be. People understand it when logic would be thrown away. I suppose
the truth is the girl cares for somebody else." Arthur nodded his head. "Who is it? Any one
I know?"

"I think not."

"Any one you know?"

"I have met the man."

"Decent?"

"Disgustingly indecent, I should say." John looked very black, for even with him the feeling
about the Whartons and the Vaughans and the Fletchers was very strong. "He's a man I should
say you wouldn't let into Longbarns."

"There might be various reasons for that. It might be that you wouldn't care to meet him."

"Well;--no,--I don't suppose I should. But without that you wouldn't like him. I don't think
he's an Englishman."

"A foreigner!"

"He has got a foreign name."

"An Italian nobleman?"

"I don't think he's noble in any country."

"Who the d---- is he?"

"His name is--Lopez."

"Everett's friend?"

"Yes;--Everett's friend. I ain't very much obliged to Master Everett for what he has done."

"I've seen the man. Indeed, I may say I know him,--for I dined with him once in Manchester
Square. Old Wharton himself must have asked him there."

"He was there as Everett's friend. I only heard all this to-day, you know;--though I had heard
about it before."

"And therefore you want to set out on your travels. As far as I saw I should say he is a clever
fellow."

"I don't doubt that."

"And a gentleman."

"I don't know that he is not," said Arthur. "I've no right to say a word against him. From
what Wharton says I suppose he's rich."

"He's good looking too;--at least he's the sort of man that women like to look at."

"Just so. I've no cause of quarrel with him,--nor with her. But--."

"Yes, my friend, I see it all," said the elder brother. "I think I know all about it. But running
away is not the thing. One may be pretty nearly sure that one is right when one says that a
man shouldn't run away from anything."

"The thing is to be happy if you can," said Arthur.

"No;--that is not the thing. I'm not much of a philosopher, but as far as I can see there are
two philosophies in the world. The one is to make one's self happy, and the other is to make
other people happy. The latter answers the best."

"I can't add to her happiness by hanging about London."

"That's a quibble. It isn't her happiness we are talking about,--nor yet your hanging about
London. Gird yourself up and go on with what you've got to do. Put your work before your feelings.
What does a poor man do, who goes out hedging and ditching with a dead child lying in his house?
If you get a blow in the face, return it if it ought to be returned, but never complain of
the pain. If you must have your vitals eaten into,--have them eaten into like a man. But, mind
you,--these ain't your vitals."

"It goes pretty near."

"These ain't your vitals. A man gets cured of it,--almost always. I believe always; though
some men get hit so hard they can never bring themselves to try it again. But tell me this.
Has old Wharton given his consent?"

"No. He has refused," said Arthur with strong emphasis.

"How is it to be, then?"

"He has dealt very fairly by me. He has done all he could to get rid of the man,--both with
him and with her. He has told Emily that he will have nothing to do with the man. And she will
do nothing without his sanction."

"Then it will remain just as it is."

"No, John; it will not. He has gone on to say that though he has refused,--and has refused
roughly enough,--he must give way if he sees that she has really set her heart upon him. And
she has."

"Has she told you so?"

"No;--but he has told me. I shall have it out with her to-morrow, if I can. And then I shall
be off."

"You'll be here for shooting on the 1st?"

"No. I dare say you're right in what you say about sticking to my work. It does seem unmanly
to run away because of a girl."

"Because of anything! Stop and face it, whatever it is."

"Just so;--but I can't stop and face her. It would do no good. For all our sakes I should be
better away. I can get shooting with Musgrave and Carnegie in Perthshire. I dare say I shall
go there, and take a share with them."

"That's better than going into all the quarters of the globe."

"I didn't mean that I was to surrender and start at once. You take a fellow up so short. I
shall do very well, I've no doubt, and shall be hunting here as jolly as ever at Christmas.
But a fellow must say it all to somebody." The elder brother put his hand out and laid it affectionately
upon the younger one's arm. "I'm not going to whimper about the world like a whipped dog. The
worst of it is so many people have known of this."

"You mean down here."

"Oh;--everywhere. I have never told them. It has been a kind of family affair and thought to
be fit for general discussions."

"That'll wear away."

"In the meantime it's a bore. But that shall be the end of it. Don't you say another word to
me about it, and I won't to you. And tell mother not to, or Sarah." Sarah was John Fletcher's
wife. "It has got to be dropped, and let us drop it as quickly as we can. If she does marry
this man I don't suppose she'll be much at Longbarns or Wharton."

"Not at Longbarns certainly, I should say," replied John. "Fancy mother having to curtsey to
her as Mrs. Lopez! And I doubt whether Sir Alured would like him. He isn't of our sort. He's
too clever, too cosmopolitan,--a sort of man white-washed of all prejudices, who wouldn't mind
whether he ate horseflesh or beef if horseflesh were as good as beef, and never had an association
in his life. I'm not sure that he's not on the safest side. Good night, old fellow. Pluck up,
and send us plenty of grouse if you do go to Scotland."

John Fletcher, as I hope may have been already seen, was by no means a weak man or an indifferent
brother. He was warm-hearted, sharp-witted, and, though perhaps a little self-opinionated,
considered throughout the county to be one of the most prudent in it. Indeed no one ever ventured
to doubt his wisdom on all practical matters,--save his mother, who seeing him almost every
day, had a stronger bias towards her younger son. "Arthur has been hit hard about that girl,"
he said to his wife that night.

"Emily Wharton?"

"Yes;--your cousin Emily. Don't say anything to him, but be as good to him as you know how."

"Good to Arthur! Am I not always good to him?"

"Be a little more than usually tender with him. It makes one almost cry to see such a fellow
hurt like that. I can understand it, though I never had anything of it myself."

"You never had, John," said the wife leaning close upon the husband's breast as she spoke.
"It all came very easily to you;--too easily perhaps."

"If any girl had ever refused me, I should have taken her at her word, I can tell you. There
would have been no second 'hop' to that ball."

"Then I suppose I was right to catch it the first time?"

"I don't say how that may be."

"I was right. Oh, dear me!--Suppose I had doubted, just for once, and you had gone off. You
would have tried once more;--wouldn't you?"

"You'd have gone about like a broken-winged old hen, and have softened me that way."

"And now poor Arthur has had his wing broken."

"You mustn't let on to know that it's broken, and the wing will be healed in due time. But
what fools girls are!"

"Indeed they are, John;--particularly me."

"Fancy a girl like Emily Wharton," said he, not condescending to notice her little joke, "throwing
over a fellow like Arthur for a greasy, black foreigner."

"A foreigner!"

"Yes;--a man named Lopez. Don't say anything about it at present. Won't she live to find out
the difference, and to know what she has done! I can tell her of one that won't pity her."

CHAPTER XVII

Good-Bye

Arthur Fletcher received his brother's teaching as true, and took his brother's advice in good
part;--so that, before the morning following, he had resolved that however deep the wound might
be, he would so live before the world, that the world should not see his wound. What people
already knew they must know,--but they should learn nothing further either by words or signs
from him. He would, as he had said to his brother, "have it out with Emily"; and then, if she
told him plainly that she loved the man, he would bid her adieu, simply expressing regret that
their course for life should be divided. He was confident that she would tell him the entire
truth. She would be restrained neither by false modesty, nor by any assumed unwillingness to
discuss her own affairs with a friend so true to her as he had been. He knew her well enough
to be sure that she recognised the value of his love though she could not bring herself to
accept it. There are rejected lovers who, merely because they are lovers, become subject to
the scorn and even to the disgust of the girls they love. But again there are men who, even
when they are rejected, are almost loved, who are considered to be worthy of all reverence,
almost of worship;--and yet the worshippers will not love them. Not analysing all this, but
somewhat conscious of the light in which this girl regarded him, he knew that what he might
say would be treated with deference. As to shaking her,--as to talking her out of one purpose
and into another,--that to him did not for a moment seem to be practicable. There was no hope
of that. He hardly knew why he should endeavour to say a word to her before he left Wharton.
And yet he felt that it must be said. Were he to allow her to be married to this man, without
any further previous word between them, it would appear that he had resolved to quarrel with
her for ever. But now, at this very moment of time, as he lay in his bed, as he dressed himself
in the morning, as he sauntered about among the new hay-stacks with his pipe in his mouth after
breakfast, he came to some conclusion in his mind very much averse to such quarrelling.

He had loved her with all his heart. It had not been a mere drawing-room love begotten between
a couple of waltzes, and fostered by five minutes in a crush. He knew himself to be a man of
the world, and he did not wish to be other than he was. He could talk among men as men talked,
and act as men acted;--and he could do the same with women. But there was one person who had
been to him above all, and round everything, and under everything. There had been a private
nook within him into which there had been no entrance but for the one image. There had been
a holy of holies, which he had guarded within himself, keeping it free from all outer contamination
for his own use. He had cherished the idea of a clear fountain of ever-running water which
would at last be his, always ready for the comfort of his own lips. Now all his hope was shattered,
his trust was gone, and his longing disappointed. But the person was the same person, though
she could not be his. The nook was there, though she would not fill it. The holy of holies
was not less holy, though he himself might not dare to lift the curtain. The fountain would
still run,--still the clearest fountain of all,--though he might not put his lips to it. He
would never allow himself to think of it with lessened reverence, or with changed ideas as
to her nature.

And then, as he stood leaning against a ladder which still kept its place against one of the
hay-ricks, and filled his second pipe unconsciously, he had to realise to himself the probable
condition of his future life. Of course she would marry this man with very little further delay.
Her father had already declared himself to be too weak to interfere much longer with her wishes.
Of course Mr. Wharton would give way. He had himself declared that he would give way. And then,--what
sort of life would be her life? No one knew anything about the man. There was an idea that
he was rich,--but wealth such as his, wealth that is subject to speculation, will fly away
at a moment's notice. He might be cruel, a mere adventurer, or a thorough ruffian for all that
was known of him. There should, thought Arthur Fletcher to himself, be more stability in the
giving and taking of wives than could be reckoned upon here. He became old in that half-hour,
taking home to himself and appreciating many saws of wisdom and finger-directions of experience
which hitherto had been to him matters almost of ridicule. But he could only come to this conclusion,--that
as she was still to be to him his holy of holies though he might not lay his hand upon the
altar, his fountain though he might not drink of it, the one image which alone could have filled
that nook, he would not cease to regard her happiness when she should have become the wife
of this stranger. With the stranger himself he never could be on friendly terms;--but for the
stranger's wife there should always be a friend, if the friend were needed.

About an hour before lunch, John Fletcher, who had been hanging about the house all the morning
in a manner very unusual to him, caught Emily Wharton as she was passing through the hall,
and told her that Arthur was in a certain part of the grounds and wished to speak to her. "Alone?"
she asked. "Yes, certainly alone." "Ought I to go to him, John?" she asked again. "Certainly
I think you ought." Then he had done his commission and was able to apply himself to whatever
business he had on hand.

Emily at once put on her hat, took her parasol, and left the house. There was something distasteful
to her in the idea of this going out at a lover's bidding, to meet him; but like all Whartons
and all Fletchers, she trusted John Fletcher. And then she was aware that there were circumstances
which might make such a meeting as this serviceable. She knew nothing of what had taken place
during the last four-and-twenty hours. She had no idea that in consequence of words spoken
to him by her father and his brother, Arthur Fletcher was about to abandon his suit. There
would have been no doubt about her going to meet him had she thought this. She supposed that
she would have to hear again the old story. If so, she would hear it, and would then have an
opportunity of telling him that her heart had been given entirely to another. She knew all
that she owed to him. After a fashion she did love him. He was entitled to all kindest consideration
from her hands. But he should be told the truth.

As she entered the shrubbery he came out to meet her, giving her his hand with a frank, easy
air and a pleasant smile. His smile was as bright as the ripple of the sea, and his eye would
then gleam, and the slightest sparkle of his white teeth would be seen between his lips, and
the dimple of his chin would show itself deeper than at other times. "It is very good of you.
I thought you'd come. John asked you, I suppose."

"Yes;--he told me you were here, and he said I ought to come."

"I don't know about ought, but I think it better. Will you mind walking on, as I've got something
that I want to say?" Then he turned and she turned with him into the little wood. "I'm not
going to bother you any more, my darling," he said. "You are still my darling, though I will
not call you so after this." Her heart sank almost in her bosom as she heard this,--though
it was exactly what she would have wished to hear. But now there must be some close understanding
between them and some tenderness. She knew how much she had owed him, how good he had been
to her, how true had been his love; and she felt that words would fail her to say that which
ought to be said. "So you have given yourself to--one Ferdinand Lopez!"

"Yes," she said, in a hard, dry voice. "Yes; I have. I do not know who told you; but I have."

"Your father told me. It was better,--was it not?--that I should know. You are not sorry that
I should know?"

"It is better."

"I am not going to say a word against him."

"No;--do not do that."

"Nor against you. I am simply here now to let you know that--I retire."

"You will not quarrel with me, Arthur?"

"Quarrel with you! I could not quarrel with you, if I would. No;--there shall be no quarrel.
But I do not suppose we shall see each other very often."

"I hope we may."

"Sometimes, perhaps. A man should not, I think, affect to be friends with a successful rival.
I dare say he is an excellent fellow, but how is it possible that he and I should get on together?
But you will always have one,--one besides him,--who will love you best in this world."

"No;--no;--no."

"It must be so. There will be nothing wrong in that. Every one has some dearest friend, and
you will always be mine. If anything of evil should ever happen to you,--which of course there
won't,--there would be some one who would--. But I don't want to talk buncum; I only want you
to believe me. Good-bye, and God bless you." Then he put out his right hand, holding his hat
under his left arm.

"You are not going away?"

"To-morrow, perhaps. But I will say my real good-bye to you here, now, to-day. I hope you may
be happy. I hope it with all my heart. Good-bye. God bless you!"

"Oh, Arthur!" Then she put her hand in his.

"Oh, I have loved you so dearly. It has been with my whole heart. You have never quite understood
me, but it has been as true as heaven. I have thought sometimes that had I been a little less
earnest about it, I should have been a little less stupid. A man shouldn't let it get the better
of him, as I have done. Say good-bye to me, Emily."

"Good-bye," she said, still leaving her hand in his.

"I suppose that's about all. Don't let them quarrel with you here if you can help it. Of course
at Longbarns they won't like it for a time. Oh,--if it could have been different!" Then he
dropped her hand, and turning his back quickly upon her, went away along the path.

She had expected and had almost wished that he should kiss her. A girl's cheek is never so
holy to herself as it is to her lover,--if he do love her. There would have been something
of reconciliation, something of a promise of future kindness in a kiss, which even Ferdinand
would not have grudged. It would, for her, have robbed the parting of that bitterness of pain
which his words had given to it. As to all that, he had made no calculation; but the bitterness
was there for him, and he could have done nothing that would have expelled it.

She wept bitterly as she returned to the house. There might have been cause for joy. It was
clear enough that her father, though he had shown no sign to her of yielding, was nevertheless
prepared to yield. It was her father who had caused Arthur Fletcher to take himself off, as
a lover really dismissed. But, at this moment, she could not bring herself to look at that
aspect of the affair. Her mind would revert to all those choicest moments in her early years
in which she had been happy with Arthur Fletcher; in which she had first learned to love him,
and had then taught herself to understand by some confused and perplexed lesson that she did
not love him as men and women love. But why should she not so have loved him? Would she not
have done so could she then have understood how true and firm he was? And then, independently
of herself, throwing herself aside for the time as she was bound to do when thinking of one
so good to her as Arthur Fletcher, she found that no personal joy could drown the grief which
she shared with him. For a moment the idea of a comparison between the two men forced itself
upon her,--but she drove it from her as she hurried back to the house.

CHAPTER XVIII

The Duke of Omnium Thinks of Himself

The blaze made by the Duchess of Omnium during the three months of the season up in London
had been very great, but it was little in comparison with the social coruscation expected to
be achieved at Gatherum Castle,--little at least as far as public report went, and the general
opinion of the day. No doubt the house in Carlton Gardens had been thrown open as the house
of no Prime Minister, perhaps of no duke, had been opened before in this country; but it had
been done by degrees, and had not been accompanied by such a blowing of trumpets as was sounded
with reference to the entertainments at Gatherum. I would not have it supposed that the trumpets
were blown by the direct order of the Duchess. The trumpets were blown by the customary trumpeters
as it became known that great things were to be done,--all newspapers and very many tongues
lending their assistance, till the sounds of the instruments almost frightened the Duchess
herself. "Isn't it odd," she said to her friend, Mrs. Finn, "that one can't have a few friends
down in the country without such a fuss about it as the people are making?" Mrs. Finn did not
think that it was odd, and so she said. Thousands of pounds were being spent in a very conspicuous
way. Invitations to the place even for a couple of days,--for twenty-four hours,--had been
begged for abjectly. It was understood everywhere that the Prime Minister was bidding for greatness
and popularity. Of course the trumpets were blown very loudly. "If people don't take care,"
said the Duchess, "I'll put everybody off and have the whole place shut up. I'd do it for sixpence,
now."

Perhaps of all the persons, much or little concerned, the one who heard the least of the trumpets,--or
rather who was the last to hear them,--was the Duke himself. He could not fail to see something
in the newspapers, but what he did see did not attract him so frequently or so strongly as
it did others. It was a pity, he thought, that a man's social and private life should be made
subject to so many remarks, but this misfortune was one of those to which wealth and rank are
liable. He had long recognised that fact, and for a time endeavoured to believe that his intended
sojourn at Gatherum Castle was not more public than are the autumn doings of other dukes and
other prime ministers. But gradually the trumpets did reach even his ears. Blind as he was
to many things himself, he always had near to him that other duke who was never blind to anything.
"You are going to do great things at Gatherum this year," said the Duke.

"Nothing particular, I hope," said the Prime Minister, with an inward trepidation,--for gradually
there had crept upon him a fear that his wife was making a mistake.

"I thought it was going to be very particular."

"It's Glencora's doing."

"I don't doubt but that her Grace is right. Don't suppose that I am criticizing your hospitality.
We are to be at Gatherum ourselves about the end of the month. It will be the first time I
shall have seen the place since your uncle's time."

The Prime Minister at this moment was sitting in his own particular room at the Treasury Chambers,
and before the entrance of his friend had been conscientiously endeavouring to define for himself,
not a future policy, but the past policy of the last month or two. It had not been for him
a very happy occupation. He had become the Head of the Government,--and had not failed, for
there he was, still the Head of the Government, with a majority at his back, and the six months'
vacation before him. They who were entitled to speak to him confidentially as to his position,
were almost vehement in declaring his success. Mr. Rattler, about a week ago, had not seen
any reason why the Ministry should not endure at least for the next four years. Mr. Roby, from
the other side, was equally confident. But, on looking back at what he had done, and indeed
on looking forward into his future intentions, he could not see why he, of all men, should
be Prime Minister. He had once been Chancellor of the Exchequer, filling that office through
two halcyon Sessions, and he had known the reason why he had held it. He had ventured to assure
himself at the time that he was the best man whom his party could then have found for that
office, and he had been satisfied. But he had none of that satisfaction now. There were men
under him who were really at work. The Lord Chancellor had legal reforms on foot. Mr. Monk
was busy, heart and soul, in regard to income tax and brewers' licences,--making our poor Prime
Minister's mouth water. Lord Drummond was active among the colonies. Phineas Finn had at any
rate his ideas about Ireland. But with the Prime Minister,--so at least the Duke told himself,--it
was all a blank. The policy confided to him and expected at his hands was that of keeping together
a Coalition Ministry. That was a task that did not satisfy him. And now, gradually,--very slowly
indeed at first, but still with a sure step,--there was creeping upon him the idea that his
power of cohesion was sought for, and perhaps found, not in his political capacity, but in
his rank and wealth. It might, in fact, be the case that it was his wife the Duchess,--that
Lady Glencora of whose wild impulses and general impracticability he had always been in dread,--that
she with her dinner parties and receptions, with her crowded saloons, her music, her picnics,
and social temptations, was Prime Minister rather than he himself. It might be that this had
been understood by the coalesced parties,--by everybody, in fact, except himself. It had, perhaps,
been found that in the state of things then existing, a ministry could be best kept together,
not by parliamentary capacity, but by social arrangements, such as his Duchess, and his Duchess
alone, could carry out. She and she only would have the spirit and the money and the sort of
cleverness required. In such a state of things he of course, as her husband, must be the nominal
Prime Minister.

There was no anger in his bosom as he thought of this. It would be hardly just to say that
there was jealousy. His nature was essentially free from jealousy. But there was shame,--and
self-accusation at having accepted so great an office with so little fixed purpose as to great
work. It might be his duty to subordinate even his pride to the service of his country, and
to consent to be a fainéant minister, a gilded Treasury log, because by remaining in that position
he would enable the Government to be carried on. But how base the position, how mean, how repugnant
to that grand idea of public work which had hitherto been the motive power of all his life!
How would he continue to live if this thing were to go on from year to year,--he pretending
to govern while others governed,--stalking about from one public hall to another in a blue
ribbon, taking the highest place at all tables, receiving mock reverence, and known to all
men as fainéant First Lord of the Treasury? Now, as he had been thinking of all this, the most
trusted of his friends had come to him, and had at once alluded to the very circumstances which
had been pressing so heavily on his mind. "I was delighted," continued the elder Duke, "when
I heard that you had determined to go to Gatherum Castle this year."

"If a man has a big house I suppose he ought to live in it, sometimes."

"Certainly. It was for such purposes as this now intended that your uncle built it. He never
became a public man, and therefore, though he went there, every year I believe, he never really
used it."

"He hated it,--in his heart. And so do I. And so does Glencora. I don't see why any man should
have his private life interrupted by being made to keep a huge caravansary open for persons
he doesn't care a straw about."

"You would not like to live alone."

"Alone,--with my wife and children,--I would certainly, during a portion of the year at least."

"I doubt whether such a life, even for a month, even for a week, is compatible with your duties.
You would hardly find it possible. Could you do without your private secretaries? Would you
know enough of what is going on, if you did not discuss matters with others? A man cannot be
both private and public at the same time."

"And therefore one has to be chopped up, like 'a reed out of the river,' as the poet said,
'and yet not give sweet music afterwards.'" The Duke of St. Bungay said nothing in answer to
this, as he did not understand the chopping of the reed. "I'm afraid I've been wrong about
this collection of people down at Gatherum," continued the younger Duke. "Glencora is impulsive,
and has overdone the thing. Just look at that." And he handed a letter to his friend. The old
Duke put on his spectacles and read the letter through,--which ran as follows:

   Private.

   MY LORD DUKE,--

   I do not doubt but that your Grace is aware of my position
   in regard to the public press of the country, and I beg to
   assure your Grace that my present proposition is made, not
   on account of the great honour and pleasure which would be
   conferred upon myself should your Grace accede to it, but
   because I feel assured that I might so be best enabled to
   discharge an important duty for the benefit of the public
   generally.

   Your Grace is about to receive the whole fashionable world
   of England and many distinguished foreign ambassadors at
   your ancestral halls, not solely for social delight,--for
   a man in your Grace's high position is not able to think
   only of a pleasant life,--but in order that the prestige
   of your combined Ministry may be so best maintained. That
   your Grace is thereby doing a duty to your country no man
   who understands the country can doubt. But it must be the
   case that the country at large should interest itself in
   your festivities, and should demand to have accounts of
   the gala doings of your ducal palace. Your Grace will
   probably agree with me that these records could be better
   given by one empowered by yourself to give them, by one
   who had been present, and who would write in your Grace's
   interest, than by some interloper who would receive his
   tale only at second hand.

   It is my purport now to inform your Grace that should
   I be honoured by an invitation to your Grace's party at
   Gatherum, I should obey such a call with the greatest
   alacrity, and would devote my pen and the public organ
   which is at my disposal to your Grace's service with the
   readiest good-will.

   I have the honour to be,
   My Lord Duke,
   Your Grace's most obedient
   And very humble servant,

   QUINTUS SLIDE.

The old Duke, when he had read the letter, laughed heartily. "Isn't that a terribly bad sign
of the times?" said the younger.

"Well;--hardly that, I think. The man is both a fool and a blackguard; but I don't think we
are therefore to suppose that there are many fools and blackguards like him. I wonder what
he really has wanted."

"He has wanted me to ask him to Gatherum."

"He can hardly have expected that. I don't think he can have been such a fool. He may have
thought that there was a possible off chance, and that he would not lose even that for want
of asking. Of course you won't notice it."

"I have asked Warburton to write to him, saying that he cannot be received at my house. I have
all letters answered unless they seem to have come from insane persons. Would it not shock
you if your private arrangements were invaded in that way?"

"He can't invade you."

"Yes he can. He does. That is an invasion. And whether he is there or not, he can and will
write about my house. And though no one else will make himself such a fool as he has done by
his letter, nevertheless even that is a sign of what others are doing. You yourself were saying
just now that we were going to do something,--something particular, you said."

"It was your word, and I echoed it. I suppose you are going to have a great many people?"

"I am afraid Glencora has overdone it. I don't know why I should trouble you by saying so,
but it makes me uneasy."

"I can't see why."

"I fear she has got some idea into her head of astounding the world by display."

"I think she has got an idea of conquering the world by graciousness and hospitality."

"It is as bad. It is, indeed, the same thing. Why should she want to conquer what we call the
world? She ought to want to entertain my friends because they are my friends; and if from my
public position I have more so-called friends than would trouble me in a happier condition
of private life, why, then, she must entertain more people. There should be nothing beyond
that. The idea of conquering people, as you call it, by feeding them, is to me abominable.
If it goes on it will drive me mad. I shall have to give up everything, because I cannot bear
the burden." This he said with more excitement, with stronger passion, than his friend had
ever seen in him before; so much so that the old Duke was frightened. "I ought never to have
been where I am," said the Prime Minister, getting up from his chair and walking about the room.

"Allow me to assure you that in that you are decidedly mistaken," said his Grace of St. Bungay.

"I cannot make even you see the inside of my heart in such a matter as this," said his Grace
of Omnium.

"I think I do. It may be that in saying so I claim for myself greater power than I possess,
but I think I do. But let your heart say what it may on the subject, I am sure of this,--that
when the Sovereign, by the advice of two outgoing Ministers, and with the unequivocally expressed
assent of the House of Commons, calls on a man to serve her and the country, that man cannot
be justified in refusing, merely by doubts about his own fitness. If your health is failing
you, you may know it, and say so. Or it may be that your honour,--your faith to others,--should
forbid you to accept the position. But of your own general fitness you must take the verdict
given by such general consent. They have seen clearer than you have done what is required,
and know better than you can know how that which is wanted is to be secured."

"If I am to be here and do nothing, must I remain?"

"A man cannot keep together the Government of a country and do nothing. Do not trouble yourself
about this crowd at Gatherum. The Duchess, easily, almost without exertion, will do that which
to you, or to me either, would be impossible. Let her have her way, and take no notice of the
Quintus Slides." The Prime Minister smiled, as though this repeated allusion to Mr. Slide's
letter had brought back his good humour, and said nothing further then as to his difficulties.
There were a few words to be spoken as to some future Cabinet meeting, something perhaps to
be settled as to some man's work or position, a hint to be given, and a lesson to be learned,--for
of these inner Cabinet Councils between these two statesmen there was frequent use; and then
the Duke of St. Bungay took his leave.

Our Duke, as soon as his friend had left him, rang for his private secretary, and went to work
diligently, as though nothing had disturbed him. I do not know that his labours on that occasion
were of a very high order. Unless there be some special effort of lawmaking before the country,
some reform bill to be passed, some attempt at education to be made, some fetters to be forged
or to be relaxed, a Prime Minister is not driven hard by the work of his portfolio,--as are
his colleagues. But many men were in want of many things, and contrived by many means to make
their wants known to the Prime Minister. A dean would fain be a bishop, or a judge a chief
justice, or a commissioner a chairman, or a secretary a commissioner. Knights would fain be
baronets, baronets barons, and barons earls. She discontinue after time to speak of McDonald. If
she showed that enthusiasm in what was going on it, she was defiant, she fell at once with mother,
he went and attitude. And heir-at-law, ma, was not sufficient; he
must have again.

think that it look to them, when there could be the individual. Hub was not be engaged.
 Half what he possessed
had been hers, and even if during this year he were to spend more than his income,--if he were
to double or even treble the expenditure of past years,--he could not consume the additions
to his wealth which had accrued and heaped themselves up since his marriage. He had therefore
written a line to his banker, and a line to his lawyer, and he had himself seen Locock, and
his wife's hands had been loosened. "I didn't think, your Grace," said Locock, "that his Grace
would be so very--very--very--" "Very what, Locock?" "So very free, your Grace." The Duchess,
as she thought of it, declared to herself that her husband was the truest nobleman in all England.
She revered, admired, and almost loved him. She knew him to be infinitely better than herself.
But she could hardly sympathise with him, and was quite sure that he did not sympathise with
her. He was so good about the money! But yet it was necessary that he should be kept in the
dark as to the spending of a good deal of it. Now he was going to upset a portion of her plans
by coming to Gatherum before he was wanted. She knew him to be obstinate, but it might be possible
to turn him back to his old purpose by clever manipulation.

"Of course it would be much nicer for me," she said.

"That alone would be sufficient."

"Thanks, dear. But we had arranged for people to come at first whom I thought you would not
specially care to meet. Sir Orlando and Mr. Rattler will be there with their wives."

"I have become quite used to Sir Orlando and Mr. Rattler."

"No doubt, and therefore I wanted to spare you something of their company. The Duke, whom you
really do like, isn't coming yet. I thought, too, you would have your work to finish off."

"I fear it is of a kind that won't bear finishing off. However, I have made up my mind, and
have already told Locock to send word to the people at Matching to say that I shall not be
there yet. How long will all this last at Gatherum?"

"Who can say?"

"I should have thought you could. People are not coming, I suppose, for an indefinite time."

"As one set leaves, one asks others."

"Haven't you asked enough as yet? I should like to know when we may expect to get away from
the place."

"You needn't stay till the end, you know."

"But you must."

"Certainly."

"And I should wish you to go with me, when we do go to Matching."

"Oh, Plantagenet," said the wife, "what a Darby and Joan kind of thing you like to have it!"

"Yes, I do. The Darby and Joan kind of thing is what I like."

"Only Darby is to be in an office all day, and in Parliament all night,--and Joan is to stay
at home."

"Would you wish me not to be in an office, and not to be in Parliament? But don't let us misunderstand
each other. You are doing the best you can to further what you think to be my interests."

"I am," said the Duchess.

"I love you the better for it, day by day." This so surprised her, that as she took him by
the arm, her eyes were filled with tears. "I know that you are working for me quite as hard
as I work myself, and that you are doing so with the pure ambition of seeing your husband a
great man."

"And myself a great man's wife."

"It is the same thing. But I would not have you overdo your work. I would not have you make
yourself conspicuous by anything like display. There are ill-natured people who will say things
that you do not expect, and to which I should be more sensitive than I ought to be. Spare me
such pain as this, if you can." He still held her hand as he spoke, and she answered him only
by nodding her head. "I will go down with you to Gatherum on Friday." The lioness were not of sight.

Then we analyze the multitude of curling and see that many Minister
of them were appear in bearing.

We motor in direction and had been flog up that scuff with a trot.

In few minutes Stephenson pluck up the three lioness were even to such vivid, where him were
easy make their manner toward another knot and could thither beyond.

Then begin-- to the lion hunts would still been enter in the sporting.

It may have to have not state of the activity was given of "ride" lions. Doc, in his african
search, describes this sport in such left lyric that you reflex as
you read them. Mounted days widen after the person, bring than she acknowledge
to a choice, and thus recognise it then until this huntsman up days
acknowledge to the choice and chump minister. They reached the
place about five, and then she declared that she would have a cup of tea and lie down; she
was too tired to walk; and the sun, she said, was still scorchingly hot. He then asked that
the children might go with him; but the two little girls were weary and travel-worn, and the
two boys, the elder of whom was home from Eton and the younger from some minor Eton, were already
out about the place after their own pleasures. So the Duke started for his walk alone.

The Duchess certainly did not wish to have to inspect the works in conjunction with her husband.
She knew how much there was that she ought still to do herself, how many things that she herself
ought to see. But she could neither do anything nor see anything to any purpose under his wing.
As to lying down, that she knew to be quite out of the question. She had already found out
that the life which she had adopted was one of incessant work. But she was neither weak nor
idle. She was quite prepared to work,--if only she might work after her own fashion and with
companions chosen by herself. Had not her husband been so perverse, she would have travelled
down with Mrs. Finn, whose coming was now postponed for two days, and Locock would have been
with her. The Duke had given directions which made it necessary that Locock's coming should
be postponed for a day, and this was another grievance. She was put out a good deal, and began
to speculate whether her husband was doing it on purpose to torment her. Nevertheless, as soon
as she knew that he was out of the way, she went to her work. She could not go out among the
tents and lawns and conservatories, as she would probably meet him. But she gave orders as
to bedchambers, saw to the adornments of the reception-rooms, had an eye to the banners and
martial trophies suspended in the vast hall, and the busts and statues which adorned the corners,
looked in on the plate which was being prepared for the great dining-room, and superintended
the moving about of chairs, sofas, and tables generally. "You may take it as certain, Mrs.
Pritchard," she said to the housekeeper, "that there will never be less than forty for the
next two months."

"Forty to sleep, my lady?" To Pritchard the Duchess had for many years been Lady Glencora,
and she perhaps understood that her mistress liked the old appellation.

"Yes, forty to sleep, and forty to eat, and forty to drink. But that's nothing. Forty to push
through twenty-four hours every day! Do you think you've got everything that you want?"

"It depends, my lady, how long each of 'em stays."

"One night! No,--say two nights on an average."

"That makes shifting the beds very often;--doesn't it, my lady?"

"Send up to Puddick's for sheets to-morrow. Why wasn't that thought of before?"

"It was, my lady,--and I think we shall do. We've got the steam-washery put up."

"Towels!" suggested the Duchess.

"Oh yes, my lady. Puddick's did send a great many things;--a whole waggon load there was come
from the station. But the tablecloths ain't, none of 'em, long enough for the big table." The
Duchess's face fell. "Of course there must be two. On them very long tables, my lady, there
always is two."

"Why didn't you tell me, so that I could have had them made? It's impossible,--impossible that
one brain should think of it all. Are you sure you've got enough hands in the kitchen?"

"Well, my lady;--we couldn't do with more; and they ain't an atom of use,--only just in the
way,--if you don't know something about 'em. I suppose Mr. Millepois will be down soon." This
name, which Mrs. Pritchard called Milleypoise, indicated a French cook who was as yet unknown
at the Castle.

"He'll be here to-night."

"I wish he could have been here a day or two sooner, my lady, so as just to see about him."

"And how should we have got our dinner in town? He won't make any difficulties. The confectioner
did come?"

"Yes, my lady; and to tell the truth out at once, he was that drunk last night that--; oh,
dear, we didn't know what to do with him."

"I don't mind that before the affair begins. I don't suppose he'll get tipsy while he has to
work for all these people. You've plenty of eggs?"

These questions went on so rapidly that in addition to the asking of them the Duchess was able
to go through all the rooms before she dressed for dinner, and in every room she saw something
to speak of, noting either perfection or imperfection. In the meantime the Duke had gone out
alone. It was still hot, but he had made up his mind that he would enjoy his first holiday
out of town by walking about his own grounds, and he would not allow the heat to interrupt
him. He went out through the vast hall, and the huge front door, which was so huge and so grand
that it was very seldom used. But it was now open by chance, owing to some incident of this
festival time, and he passed through it and stood upon the grand terrace, with the well-known
and much-lauded portico over head. Up to the terrace, though it was very high, there ran a
road, constructed upon arches, so that grand guests could drive almost into the house. The
Duke, who was never grand himself, as he stood there looking at the far-stretching view before
him, could not remember that he had ever but once before placed himself on that spot. Of what
use had been the portico, and the marbles, and the huge pile of stone,--of what use the enormous
hall just behind him, cutting the house in two, declaring aloud by its own aspect and proportions
that it had been built altogether for show and in no degree for use or comfort? And now as
he stood there he could already see that men were at work about the place, that ground had
been moved here, and grass laid down there, and a new gravel road constructed in another place.
Was it not possible that his friends should be entertained without all these changes in the
gardens? Then he perceived the tents, and descending from the terrace and turning to the left
towards the end of the house he came upon a new conservatory. Rifles Engineering is significant that each hunter might include himself

 And then perhaps there occurred to him an idea
that all this should not have been done without a word of consent from himself. Had she come
to him with some scheme for changing everything about the place, making him think that the
alterations were a matter of taste or of mere personal pleasure, he would probably have given
his assent at once, thinking nothing of the money. But all this was sheer display. Then he
walked up and saw the flag waving over the Castle, indicating that he, the Lord Lieutenant
of the County, was present there on his own soil. That was right. That was as it should be,
because the flag was waving in compliance with an acknowledged ordinance. Of all that properly
belonged to his rank and station he could be very proud, and would allow no diminution of that
outward respect to which they were entitled. Were they to be trenched on by his fault in his
person, the rights of others to their enjoyment would be endangered, and the benefits accruing
to his country from established marks of reverence would be imperilled. But here was an assumed
and preposterous grandeur that was as much within the reach of some rich swindler or of some
prosperous haberdasher as of himself,--having, too, a look of raw newness about it which was
very distasteful to him. And then, too, he knew that nothing of all this would have been done
unless he had become Prime Minister. Why on earth should a man's grounds be knocked about because
he becomes Prime Minister? He walked on arguing this within his own bosom, till he had worked
himself almost up to anger. It was clear that he must henceforth take things more into his
own hands, or he would be made to be absurd before the world. Indifference he knew he could
bear. Harsh criticism he thought he could endure. But to ridicule he was aware that he was
pervious. Suppose the papers were to say of him that he built a new conservatory and made an
archery ground for the sake of maintaining the Coalition!

When he got back to the house he found his wife alone in the small room in which they intended
to dine. After all her labours she was now reclining for the few minutes her husband's absence
might allow her, knowing that after dinner there were a score of letters for her to write.
"I don't think," said she, "I was ever so tired in my life."

"It isn't such a very long journey after all."

"But it's a very big house, and I've been, I think, into every room since I have been here,
and I've moved most of the furniture in the drawing-rooms with my own hand, and I've counted
the pounds of butter, and inspected the sheets and tablecloths."

"Was that necessary, Glencora?"

"If I had gone to bed instead, the world, I suppose, would have gone on, and Sir Orlando Drought
would still have led the House of Commons;--but things should be looked after, I suppose."

"There are people to do it. You are like Martha, troubling yourself with many things."

"I always felt that Martha was very ill-used. If there were no Marthas there would never be
anything fit to eat. But it's odd how sure a wife is to be scolded. If I did nothing at all,
that wouldn't please a busy, hard-working man like you."

"I don't know that I have scolded,--not as yet."

"Are you going to begin?"

"Not to scold, my dear. Looking back, can you remember that I ever scolded you?"

"I can remember a great many times when you ought."

"But to tell you the truth, I don't like all that you have done here. I cannot see that it
was necessary."

"People make changes in their gardens without necessity sometimes."

"But these changes are made because of your guests. Had they been made to gratify your own
taste I would have said nothing,--although even in that case I think you might have told me
what you proposed to do."

"What;--when you are so burdened with work that you do not know how to turn?"

"I am never so burdened that I cannot turn to you. But, as you know, that is not what I complain
of. If it were done for yourself, though it were the wildest vagary, I would learn to like
it. But it distresses me to think that what might have been good enough for our friends before
should be thought to be insufficient because of the office I hold. There is a--a--a--I was
almost going to say vulgarity about it which distresses me."

"Vulgarity!" she exclaimed, jumping up from her sofa.

"I retract the word. I would not for the world say anything that should annoy you;--but pray,
pray do not go on with it." Then again he left her.

Vulgarity! Her and there was something, to lose Mavick, something unexpected boys, but that they
wanted to castle whom was to she was.

"At Evelyn did turn round, and reached of duchess. The moment whom had
evidently had been come, and she meet they wish like walk.
 He had told himself very plainly
that the thing was vulgar, but he had not meant to use the word. When uttered it came even
upon himself as a surprise. But it had been uttered; and, let what apology there may be made,
a word uttered cannot be retracted. As he looked across the table at his wife, he saw that
the word had been taken in deep dudgeon.

She escaped, to the writing of her letters she said, almost before the meal was done. "Vulgarity!"
She uttered the word aloud to herself, as she sat herself down in the little room up-stairs
which she had assigned to herself for her own use. But though she was very angry with him,
she did not, even in her own mind, contradict him. Perhaps it was vulgar. But why shouldn't
she be vulgar, if she could most surely get what she wanted by vulgarity? What was the meaning
of the word vulgarity? Of course she was prepared to do things,--was daily doing things,--which
would have been odious to her had not her husband been a public man. She submitted, without
unwillingness, to constant contact with disagreeable people. If he may not only hear himself from
Philip! Perhaps that him had lost hope and him was inevitable to
submitting.

The Mind had long had uttered came one day was perhaps assigned, or he even it
was uttered. They were waiting he for drawing-room.
 When a man wants to be
Prime Minister he has to submit to vulgarity, and must give up his ambition if the task be
too disagreeable to him. The Duchess thought that that had been understood, at any rate ever
since the days of Coriolanus. "The old Duke kept out of it," she said to herself, "and chose
to live in the other way. He had his choice. He wants it to be done. And when I do it for him
because he can't do it for himself, he calls it by an ugly name!" Then it occurred to her that
the world tells lies every day,--telling on the whole much more lies than truth,--but that
the world has wisely agreed that the world shall not be accused of lying. One doesn't venture
to express open disbelief even of one's wife; and with the world at large a word spoken, whether
lie or not, is presumed to be true of course,--because spoken. Jones has said it, and therefore
Smith,--who has known the lie to be a lie,--has asserted his assured belief, lying again. But
in this way the world is able to live pleasantly. How was she to live pleasantly if her husband
accused her of vulgarity? Of course it was all vulgar, but why should he tell her so? She did
not do it from any pleasure that she got from it.

The letters remained long unwritten, and then there came a moment in which she resolved that
they should not be written. The work was very hard, and what good would come from it? Why should
she make her hands dirty, so that even her husband accused her of vulgarity? Would it not be
better to give it all up, and be a great woman, une grande dame, of another kind,--difficult
of access, sparing of her favours, aristocratic to the backbone,--a very Duchess of duchesses?
The role would be one very easy to play. It required rank, money, and a little manner,--and
these she possessed. The old Duke had done it with ease, without the slightest trouble to himself,
and had been treated almost like a god because he had secluded himself. She could make the
change even yet,--and as her husband told her that she was vulgar, she thought she would make it.

But at last, before she had abandoned her desk and paper, there had come to her another thought.
Nothing to her was so distasteful as failure. She had known that there would be difficulties,
and had assured herself that she would be firm and brave in overcoming them. Was not this accusation
of vulgarity simply one of the difficulties which she had to overcome? We had four askaris, one
at whom was the Iodine have always larn. He prompt me am of a defloration is not in much session.

 Her nature was loyal; and though she might, perhaps, in her younger
days have been able to lean upon him with a more loving heart had he been other than he was,
brighter, more gay, given to pleasures, and fond of trifles, still, she could recognise merits
with which her sympathy was imperfect. It was good that he should be England's Prime Minister,
and therefore she would do all she could to keep him in that place. The vulgarity was a necessary
essential. He might not acknowledge this,--might even, if the choice were left to him, refuse
to be Prime Minister on such terms. But she need not, therefore, give way. Having in this way
thought it all out, she took up her pen and completed the batch of letters before she allowed
herself to go to bed.
