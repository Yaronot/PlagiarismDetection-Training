A TALE IN SEVEN STORIES

FIRST STORY

WHICH DEALS WITH A MIRROR AND ITS FRAGMENTS

Now we are about to begin, and you must attend; and when we get to the end of the story, you
will know more than you do now about a very wicked hobgoblin. He was one of the worst kind;
in fact he was a real demon. One day he was in a high state of delight because he had invented
a mirror with this peculiarity, that every good and pretty thing reflected in it shrank away
to almost nothing. On the other hand, every bad and good-for-nothing thing stood out and looked
its worst. The most beautiful landscapes reflected in it looked like boiled spinach, and the
best people became hideous, or else they were upside down and had no bodies. Their faces were
distorted beyond recognition, and if they had even one freckle it appeared to spread all over
the nose and mouth. The demon thought this immensely amusing. If a good thought passed through
any one's mind, it turned to a grin in the mirror, and this caused real delight to the demon.
All the scholars in the demon's school, for he kept a school, reported that a miracle had taken
place: now for the first time it had become possible to see what the world and mankind were
really like. They ran about all over with the mirror, till at last there was not a country
or a person which had not been seen in this distorting mirror. They even wanted to fly up to
heaven with it to mock the angels; but the higher they flew, the more it grinned, so much so
that they could hardly hold it, and at last it slipped out of their hands and fell to the earth,
shivered into hundreds of millions and billions of bits. Even then it did more harm than ever.
Some of these bits were not as big as a grain of sand, and these flew about all over the world,
getting into people's eyes, and, once in, they stuck there, and distorted everything they looked
at, or made them see everything that was amiss. Each tiniest grain of glass kept the same power
as that possessed by the whole mirror. Some people even got a bit of the glass into their hearts,
and that was terrible, for the heart became like a lump of ice. Some of the fragments were
so big that they were used for window panes, but it was not advisable to look at one's friends
through these panes. Other bits were made into spectacles, and it was a bad business when people
put on these spectacles meaning to be just. The bad demon laughed till he split his sides;
it tickled him to see the mischief he had done. But some of these fragments were still left
floating about the world, and you shall hear what happened to them.

SECOND STORY

ABOUT A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL

In a big town crowded with houses and people, where there is no room for gardens, people have
to be content with flowers in pots instead. In one of these towns lived two children who managed
to have something bigger than a flower pot for a garden. They were not brother and sister,
but they were just as fond of each other as if they had been. Their parents lived opposite
each other in two attic rooms. The roof of one house just touched the roof of the next one,
with only a rain-water gutter between them. They each had a little dormer window, and one only
had to step over the gutter to get from one house to the other. Each of the parents had a large
window-box, in which they grew pot herbs and a little rose-tree. There was one in each box,
and they both grew splendidly. Then it occurred to the parents to put the boxes across the
gutter, from house to house, and they looked just like two banks of flowers. The pea vines
hung down over the edges of the boxes, and the roses threw out long creepers which twined round
the windows. It was almost like a green triumphal arch. The boxes were high, and the children
knew they must not climb up on to them, but they were often allowed to have their little stools
out under the rose-trees, and there they had delightful games. Of course in the winter there
was an end to these amusements. The windows were often covered with hoar-frost; then they would
warm coppers on the stove and stick them on the frozen panes, where they made lovely peep-holes,
as round as possible. Then a bright eye would peep through these holes, one from each window.
The little boy's name was Kay, and the little girl's Gerda.

In the summer they could reach each other with one bound, but in the winter they had to go
down all the stairs in one house and up all the stairs in the other, and outside there were
snowdrifts.

'Yes, indeed they have,' said the grandmother. 'She flies where the swarm is thickest. She
is biggest of them all, and she never remains on the ground. She always flies up again to the sky.

In the evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed, he crept up on to the chair
by the window, and peeped out of the little hole. A few snow-flakes were falling, and one of
these, the biggest, remained on the edge of the window-box. It grew bigger and bigger, till
it became the figure of a woman, dressed in the finest white gauze, which appeared to be made
of millions of starry flakes. She was delicately lovely, but all ice, glittering, dazzling
ice. Still she was alive, her eyes shone like two bright stars, but there was no rest or peace
in them. She nodded to the window and waved her hand. The little boy was frightened and jumped
down off the chair, and then he fancied that a big bird flew past the window.

The next day was bright and frosty, and then came the thaw--and after that the spring. The
sun shone, green buds began to appear, the swallows built their nests, and people began to
open their windows. The little children began to play in their garden on the roof again. The
roses were in splendid bloom that summer; the little girl had learnt a hymn, and there was
something in it about roses, and that made her think of her own. She sang it to the little
boy, and then he sang it with her--

    'Where roses deck the flowery vale,
    There, Infant Jesus, we thee hail!'

The children took each other by the hands, kissed the roses, and rejoiced in God's bright sunshine,
and spoke to it as if the Child Jesus were there. What lovely summer days they were, and how
delightful it was to sit out under the fresh rose-trees, which seemed never tired of blooming.

Kay and Gerda were looking at a picture book of birds and animals one day--it had just struck
five by the church clock--when Kay said, 'Oh, something struck my heart, and I have got something
in my eye!'

The little girl put her arms round his neck, he blinked his eye; there was nothing to be seen.

'I believe it is gone,' he said; but it was not gone. It was one of those very grains of glass
from the mirror, the magic mirror. You remember that horrid mirror, in which all good and great
things reflected in it became small and mean, while the bad things were magnified, and every
flaw became very apparent.

Poor Kay! a grain of it had gone straight to his heart, and would soon turn it to a lump of
ice. He did not feel it any more, but it was still there.

'Why do you cry?' he asked; 'it makes you look ugly; there's nothing the matter with me. How
horrid!' he suddenly cried; 'there's a worm in that rose, and that one is quite crooked; after
all, they are nasty roses, and so are the boxes they are growing in!' He kicked the box and
broke off two of the roses.

'What are you doing, Kay?' cried the little girl. When he saw her alarm, he broke off another
rose, and then ran in by his own window, and left dear little Gerda alone. He did it very well
and people laughed at him. He was soon able to imitate every one in the street; he could make
fun of all their peculiarities and failings. 'He will turn out a clever fellow,' said people.
But it was all that bit of glass in his heart, that bit of glass in his eye, and it made him
tease little Gerda who was so devoted to him. He played quite different games now; he seemed
to have grown older.

'Do you see how cleverly they are made?' said Kay. 'Much more interesting than looking at real
flowers. And there is not a single flaw in them; they are perfect, if only they would not melt.'

Shortly after, he appeared in his thick gloves, with his sledge on his back. He shouted right
into Gerda's ear, 'I have got leave to drive in the big square where the other boys play!'
and away he went.

In the big square the bolder boys used to tie their little sledges to the farm carts and go
a long way in this fashion. They had no end of fun over it. Just in the middle of their games
a big sledge came along; it was painted white, and the occupant wore a white fur coat and cap.
The sledge drove twice round the square, and Kay quickly tied his sledge on behind. Then off
they went, faster, and faster, into the next street. The driver turned round and nodded to
Kay in the most friendly way, just as if they knew each other. Every time Kay wanted to loose
his sledge the person nodded again, and Kay stayed where he was, and they drove right out through
the town gates. Then the snow began to fall so heavily that the little boy could not see a
hand before him as they rushed along. He undid the cords and tried to get away from the big
sledge, but it was no use, his little sledge stuck fast, and on they rushed, faster than the
wind. He shouted aloud, but nobody heard him, and the sledge tore on through the snow-drifts.
Every now and then it gave a bound, as if they were jumping over hedges and ditches. He was
very frightened, and he wanted to say his prayers, but he could only remember the multiplication
tables.

The snow-flakes grew bigger and bigger, till at last they looked like big white chickens. All
at once they sprang on one side, the big sledge stopped and the person who drove got up, coat
and cap smothered in snow. It was a tall and upright lady all shining white, the Snow Queen
herself.

'We have come along at a good pace,' she said; 'but it's cold enough to kill one; creep inside
my bearskin coat.'

She took him into the sledge by her, wrapped him in her furs, and he felt as if he were sinking
into a snowdrift.

'Are you still cold?' she asked, and she kissed him on the forehead. Ugh! it was colder than
ice, it went to his very heart, which was already more than half ice; he felt as if he were
dying, but only for a moment, and then it seemed to have done him good; he no longer felt the cold.

'My sledge! don't forget my sledge!' He only remembered it now; it was tied to one of the white
chickens which flew along behind them. The Snow Queen kissed Kay again, and then he forgot
all about little Gerda, Grandmother, and all the others at home.

'Now I mustn't kiss you any more,' she said, 'or I should kiss you to death!'

Kay looked at her, she was so pretty; a cleverer, more beautiful face could hardly be imagined.
She did not seem to be made of ice now, as she was outside the window when she waved her hand
to him.

STORY THREE

THE GARDEN OF THE WOMAN LEARNED IN MAGIC

But how was little Gerda getting on all this long time since Kay left her? Where could he be?
Nobody knew, nobody could say anything about him. All that the other boys knew was, that they
had seen him tie his little sledge to a splendid big one which drove away down the street and
out of the town gates. Nobody knew where he was, and many tears were shed; little Gerda cried
long and bitterly. At last, people said he was dead; he must have fallen into the river which
ran close by the town. Oh, what long, dark, winter days those were!

At last the spring came and the sunshine.

'Kay is dead and gone,' said little Gerda.

'I don't believe it,' said the sunshine.

'He is dead and gone,' she said to the swallows.

'Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will give you my red shoes if you will
bring him back to me again.'

She thought the little ripples nodded in such a curious way, so she took off her red shoes,
her most cherished possessions, and threw them both into the river. They fell close by the
shore, and were carried straight back to her by the little wavelets; it seemed as if the river
would not accept her offering, as it had not taken little Kay.

She only thought she had not thrown them far enough; so she climbed into a boat which lay among
the rushes, then she went right out to the further end of it, and threw the shoes into the
water again. But the boat was loose, and her movements started it off, and it floated away
from the shore: she felt it moving and tried to get out, but before she reached the other end
the boat was more than a yard from the shore, and was floating away quite quickly.

Little Gerda was terribly frightened, and began to cry, but nobody heard her except the sparrows,
and they could not carry her ashore, but they flew alongside twittering, as if to cheer her,
'We are here, we are here.' The boat floated rapidly away with the current; little Gerda sat
quite still with only her stockings on; her little red shoes floated behind, but they could
not catch up the boat, which drifted away faster and faster.

The banks on both sides were very pretty with beautiful flowers, fine old trees, and slopes
dotted with sheep and cattle, but not a single person.

'Perhaps the river is taking me to little Kay,' thought Gerda, and that cheered her; she sat
up and looked at the beautiful green banks for hours. Gerda called out again, louder than before,
and then an old, old woman came out of the house; she was leaning upon a big, hooked stick,
and she wore a big sun hat, which was covered with beautiful painted flowers.

'You poor little child,' said the old woman, 'how ever were you driven out on this big, strong
river into the wide, wide world alone?' Then she walked right into the water, and caught hold
of the boat with her hooked stick; she drew it ashore, and lifted little Gerda out.

Gerda was delighted to be on dry land again, but she was a little bit frightened of the strange
old woman.

'Come, tell me who you are, and how you got here,' said she.

When Gerda had told her the whole story and asked her if she had seen Kay, the woman said she
had not seen him, but that she expected him. Gerda must not be sad, she was to come and taste
her cherries and see her flowers, which were more beautiful than any picture-book; each one
had a story to tell. Then she took Gerda by the hand, they went into the little house, and
the old woman locked the door.

The windows were very high up, and they were red, blue, and yellow; they threw a very curious
light into the room. On the table were quantities of the most delicious cherries, of which
Gerda had leave to eat as many as ever she liked.

'I have long wanted a little girl like you!' said the old woman. 'You will see how well we
shall get on together.' While she combed her hair Gerda had forgotten all about Kay, for the
old woman was learned in the magic art; but she was not a bad witch, she only cast spells over
people for a little amusement, and she wanted to keep Gerda. She therefore went into the garden
and waved her hooked stick over all the rose-bushes, and however beautifully they were flowering,
all sank down into the rich black earth without leaving a trace behind them. The old woman
was afraid that if Gerda saw the roses she would be reminded of Kay, and would want to run
away. Then she took Gerda into the flower garden. What a delicious scent there was! and every
imaginable flower for every season was in that lovely garden; no picture-book could be brighter
or more beautiful. Then she was put into a lovely bed with rose-coloured silken coverings stuffed
with violets; she slept and dreamt as lovely dreams as any queen on her wedding day.

The next day she played with the flowers in the garden again--and many days passed in the same
way. Gerda knew every flower, but however many there were, she always thought there was one
missing, but which it was she did not know. This is the consequence of being absent-minded.

'What!' said Gerda, 'are there no roses here?' and she sprang in among the flower-beds and
sought, but in vain! Her hot tears fell on the very places where the roses used to be; when
the warm drops moistened the earth the rose-trees shot up again, just as full of bloom as when
they sank. Gerda embraced the roses and kissed them, and then she thought of the lovely roses
at home, and this brought the thought of little Kay.

'Oh, how I have been delayed,' said the little girl, 'I ought to have been looking for Kay!
Don't you know where he is?' she asked the roses. 'Do you think he is dead and gone?'

'He is not dead,' said the roses. 'For we have been down underground, you know, and all the
dead people are there, but Kay is not among them.'

'Oh, thank you!' said little Gerda, and then she went to the other flowers and looked into
their cups and said, 'Do you know where Kay is?'

But each flower stood in the sun and dreamt its own dreams. Little Gerda heard many of these,
but never anything about Kay.

And what said the Tiger lilies?

'Do you hear the drum? rub-a-dub, it has only two notes, rub-a-dub, always the same. The wailing
of women and the cry of the preacher. The Hindu woman in her long red garment stands on the
pile, while the flames surround her and her dead husband. But the woman is only thinking of
the living man in the circle round, whose eyes burn with a fiercer fire than that of the flames
which consume the body. Do the flames of the heart die in the fire?'

'I understand nothing about that,' said little Gerda.

'That is my story,' said the Tiger lily.

'What does the convolvulus say?'

'An old castle is perched high over a narrow mountain path, it is closely covered with ivy,
almost hiding the old red walls, and creeping up leaf upon leaf right round the balcony where
stands a beautiful maiden. Her silken robes rustle softly as she bends over and says, 'Will
he never come?''

'Is it Kay you mean?' asked Gerda.

'I am only talking about my own story, my dream,' answered the convolvulus.

What said the little snowdrop?

'Between two trees a rope with a board is hanging; it is a swing. Two pretty little girls in
snowy frocks and green ribbons fluttering on their hats are seated on it. A little black dog
runs up, he is almost as light as the bubbles, he stands up on his hind legs and wants to be
taken into the swing, but it does not stop. The little dog falls with an angry bark; they jeer
at it; the bubble bursts. A swinging plank, a fluttering foam picture--that is my story!'

'I daresay what you tell me is very pretty, but you speak so sadly and you never mention little
Kay.'

What says the hyacinth?

'They were three beautiful sisters, all most delicate, and quite transparent. One wore a crimson
robe, the other a blue, and the third was pure white. These three danced hand-in-hand, by the
edge of the lake in the moonlight. They were human beings, not fairies of the wood. The fragrant
air attracted them, and they vanished into the wood; here the fragrance was stronger still.
Three coffins glide out of the wood towards the lake, and in them lie the maidens. Oh, is little
Kay really dead?

'You are a bright little sun,' said Gerda. 'Tell me if you know where I shall find my playfellow.'

The buttercup shone brightly and returned Gerda's glance. What song could the buttercup sing?
It would not be about Kay.

'God's bright sun shone into a little court on the first day of spring. The sunbeams stole
down the neighbouring white wall, close to which bloomed the first yellow flower of the season;
it shone like burnished gold in the sun. An old woman had brought her arm-chair out into the
sun; her granddaughter, a poor and pretty little maid-servant, had come to pay her a short
visit, and she kissed her. There was gold, heart's gold, in the kiss. Gold on the lips, gold
on the ground, and gold above, in the early morning beams! Of element. (the APPEAL to some Family-NGO

The reindeer jumped into the air for joy. The robber girl lifted little Gerda up, and had the
forethought to tie her on, nay, even to give her a little cushion to sit upon. 'Here, after
all, I will give you your fur boots back, for it will be very cold, but I will keep your muff,
it is too pretty to part with. Still you shan't be cold. Here are my mother's big mittens for
you, they will reach up to your elbows; here, stick your hands in! Now your hands look just
like my nasty mother's!'

Gerda shed tears of joy.

'I don't like you to whimper!' said the little robber girl. 'You ought to be looking delighted;
and here are two loaves and a ham for you, so that you shan't starve.'

These things were tied on to the back of the reindeer; the little robber girl opened the door,
called in all the big dogs, and then she cut the halter with her knife, and said to the reindeer,
'Now run, but take care of my little girl!'

Gerda stretched out her hands in the big mittens to the robber girl and said good-bye; and
then the reindeer darted off over briars and bushes, through the big wood, over swamps and
plains, as fast as it could go. The wolves howled and the ravens screamed, while the red lights
quivered up in the sky.

'There are my old northern lights,' said the reindeer; 'see how they flash!' and on it rushed
faster than ever, day and night. The loaves were eaten, and the ham too, and then they were
in Lapland.

SIXTH STORY

THE LAPP WOMAN AND THE FINN WOMAN

They stopped by a little hut, a very poverty-stricken one; the roof sloped right down to the
ground, and the door was so low that the people had to creep on hands and knees when they wanted
to go in or out. Gerda was so overcome by the cold that she could not speak at all.

'Oh, you poor creatures!' said the Lapp woman; 'you've got a long way to go yet; you will have
to go hundreds of miles into Finmark, for the Snow Queen is paying a country visit there, and
she burns blue lights every night. I will write a few words on a dried stock-fish, for I have
no paper. I will give it to you to take to the Finn woman up there. She will be better able
to direct you than I can.'

So when Gerda was warmed, and had eaten and drunk something, the Lapp woman wrote a few words
on a dried stock-fish and gave it to her, bidding her take good care of it. Then she tied her
on to the reindeer again, and off they flew. Flicker, flicker, went the beautiful blue northern
lights up in the sky all night long;--at last they came to Finmark, and knocked on the Finn
woman's chimney, for she had no door at all.

There was such a heat inside that the Finn woman went about almost naked; she was little and
very grubby. She at once loosened Gerda's things, and took off the mittens and the boots, or
she would have been too hot. Then she put a piece of ice on the reindeer's head, and after
that she read what was written on the stock-fish. She read it three times, and then she knew
it by heart, and put the fish into the pot for dinner; there was no reason why it should not
be eaten, and she never wasted anything.

Again the reindeer told his own story first, and then little Gerda's. The Finn woman blinked
with her wise eyes, but she said nothing.

'You are so clever,' said the reindeer, 'I know you can bind all the winds of the world with
a bit of sewing cotton. When a skipper unties one knot he gets a good wind, when he unties
two it blows hard, and if he undoes the third and the fourth he brings a storm about his head
wild enough to blow down the forest trees. Won't you give the little girl a drink, so that
she may have the strength of twelve men to overcome the Snow Queen?'

'The strength of twelve men,' said the Finn woman. 'Yes, that will be about enough.'

She went along to a shelf and took down a big folded skin, which she unrolled. There were curious
characters written on it, and the Finn woman read till the perspiration poured down her forehead.

But the reindeer again implored her to give Gerda something, and Gerda looked at her with such
beseeching eyes, full of tears, that the Finn woman began blinking again, and drew the reindeer
along into a corner, where she whispered to it, at the same time putting fresh ice on its head.

'Little Kay is certainly with the Snow Queen, and he is delighted with everything there. He
thinks it is the best place in the world, but that is because he has got a splinter of glass
in his heart and a grain of glass in his eye. Don't you see how great it is? Don't you see
how both man and beast have to serve her? How she has got on as well as she has on her bare
feet? We must not tell her what power she has; it is in her heart, because she is such a sweet
innocent child. If she can't reach the Snow Queen herself, then we can't help her. The Snow
Queen's gardens begin just two miles from here; you can carry the little girl as far as that.
Put her down by the big bush standing there in the snow covered with red berries. Don't stand
gossiping, but hurry back to me!' Then the Finn woman lifted Gerda on the reindeer's back,
and it rushed off as hard as it could.

'Oh, I have not got my boots, and I have not got my mittens!' cried little Gerda.

She soon felt the want of them in that cutting wind, but the reindeer did not dare to stop.
It ran on till it came to the bush with the red berries. There it put Gerda down, and kissed
her on the mouth, while big shining tears trickled down its face.

She ran forward as quickly as she could. A whole regiment of snow-flakes came towards her;
they did not fall from the sky, for it was quite clear, with the northern lights shining brightly.
No; these snow-flakes ran along the ground, and the nearer they came the bigger they grew.
Gerda remembered well how big and ingenious they looked under the magnifying glass. But the
size of these was monstrous. They were alive; they were the Snow Queen's advanced guard, and
they took the most curious shapes. Some looked like big, horrid porcupines, some like bundles
of knotted snakes with their heads sticking out. Others, again, were like fat little bears
with bristling hair, but all were dazzling white and living snow-flakes.

Then little Gerda said the Lord's Prayer, and the cold was so great that her breath froze as
it came out of her mouth, and she could see it like a cloud of smoke in front of her. It grew
thicker and thicker, till it formed itself into bright little angels, who grew bigger and bigger
when they touched the ground. They all wore helmets, and carried shields and spears in their
hands. More and more of them appeared, and when Gerda had finished her prayer she was surrounded
by a whole legion. They pierced the snow-flakes with their spears and shivered them into a
hundred pieces, and little Gerda walked fearlessly and undauntedly through them. The angels
touched her hands and her feet, and then she hardly felt how cold it was, but walked quickly
on towards the Palace of the Snow Queen.

Now we must see what Kay was about. He was not thinking about Gerda at all, least of all that
she was just outside the Palace.

SEVENTH STORY

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SNOW QUEEN'S PALACE AND AFTERWARDS

The Palace walls were made of drifted snow, and the windows and doors of the biting winds.
There were over a hundred rooms in it, shaped just as the snow had drifted. The biggest one
stretched for many miles. They were all lighted by the strongest northern lights. All the rooms
were immensely big and empty, and glittering in their iciness. There was never any gaiety in
them; not even so much as a ball for the little bears, when the storms might have turned up
as the orchestra, and the polar bears might have walked about on their hind legs and shown
off their grand manners. There was never even a little game-playing party, for such games as
'touch last' or 'the biter bit'--no, not even a little gossip over the coffee cups for the
white fox misses. Immense, vast, and cold were the Snow Queen's halls. The northern lights
came and went with such regularity that you could count the seconds between their coming and
going. In the midst of these never-ending snow-halls was a frozen lake. It was broken up on
the surface into a thousand bits, but each piece was so exactly like the others that the whole
formed a perfect work of art. The Snow Queen sat in the very middle of it when she sat at home.
She then said that she was sitting on 'The Mirror of Reason,' and that it was the best and
only one in the world. He went about dragging some sharp, flat pieces of ice, which he placed
in all sorts of patterns, trying to make something out of them; just as when we at home have
little tablets of wood, with which we make patterns, and call them a 'Chinese puzzle.'

Kay's patterns were most ingenious, because they were the 'Ice Puzzles of Reason.' In his eyes
they were first-rate and of the greatest importance: this was because of the grain of glass
still in his eye. He made many patterns forming words, but he never could find out the right
way to place them for one particular word, a word he was most anxious to make. It was 'Eternity.'
The Snow Queen had said to him that if he could find out this word he should be his own master,
and she would give him the whole world and a new pair of skates. But he could not discover it.

'Now I am going to fly away to the warm countries,' said the Snow Queen. 'I want to go and
peep into the black caldrons!' She meant the volcanoes Etna and Vesuvius by this. 'I must whiten
them a little; it does them good, and the lemons and the grapes too!' And away she flew.

Kay sat quite alone in all those many miles of empty ice halls. He looked at his bits of ice,
and thought and thought, till something gave way within him. He sat so stiff and immovable
that one might have thought he was frozen to death.

Then it was that little Gerda walked into the Palace, through the great gates in a biting wind.
She said her evening prayer, and the wind dropped as if lulled to sleep, and she walked on
into the big empty hall. She saw Kay, and knew him at once; she flung her arms round his neck,
held him fast, and cried, 'Kay, little Kay, have I found you at last?'

But he sat still, rigid and cold. He knew her, and shouted with joy, 'Gerda, dear little Gerda!
where have you been for such a long time? And where have I been?' He looked round and said,
'How cold it is here; how empty and vast!' He kept tight hold of Gerda, who laughed and cried
for joy. The Snow Queen might come home whenever she liked, his order of release was written
there in shining letters of ice.

They took hold of each other's hands and wandered out of the big Palace. They talked about
grandmother, and about the roses upon the roof. Wherever they went the winds lay still and
the sun broke through the clouds. Then they went on to the Lapp woman; she had made new clothes
for them and prepared her sledge. Both the reindeer ran by their side, to the boundaries of
the country; here the first green buds appeared, and they said 'Good-bye' to the reindeer and
the Lapp woman. They heard the first little birds twittering and saw the buds in the forest.
Out of it came riding a young girl on a beautiful horse, which Gerda knew, for it had drawn
the golden chariot. She had a scarlet cap on her head and pistols in her belt; it was the little
robber girl, who was tired of being at home. She was riding northwards to see how she liked
it before she tried some other part of the world. She knew them again, and Gerda recognised
her with delight.

'You are a nice fellow to go tramping off!' she said to little Kay. 'I should like to know
if you deserve to have somebody running to the end of the world for your sake!'

But Gerda patted her cheek, and asked about the Prince and Princess. 'The tame sweetheart is
a widow, and goes about with a bit of black wool tied round her leg. She pities herself bitterly,
but it's all nonsense! But tell me how you got on yourself, and where you found him.'

Gerda and Kay both told her all about it.

'Snip, snap, snurre, it's all right at last then!' she said, and she took hold of their hands
and promised that if she ever passed through their town she would pay them a visit. Then she
rode off into the wide world. But Kay and Gerda walked on, hand in hand, and wherever they
went they found the most delightful spring and blooming flowers. Soon they recognised the big
town where they lived, with its tall towers, in which the bells still rang their merry peals.
They went straight on to grandmother's door, up the stairs and into her room. Everything was
just as they had left it, and the old clock ticked in the corner, and the hands pointed to
the time. As they went through the door into the room they perceived that they were grown up.
The roses clustered round the open window, and there stood their two little chairs. Kay and
Gerda sat down upon them, still holding each other by the hand. All the cold empty grandeur
of the Snow Queen's palace had passed from their memory like a bad dream.

THE NIGHTINGALE

In China, as you know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all the people around him are Chinamen
too. It is many years since the story I am going to tell you happened, but that is all the
more reason for telling it, lest it should be forgotten. The emperor's palace was the most
beautiful thing in the world; it was made entirely of the finest porcelain, very costly, but
at the same time so fragile that it could only be touched with the very greatest care. There
were the most extraordinary flowers to be seen in the garden; the most beautiful ones had little
silver bells tied to them, which tinkled perpetually, so that one should not pass the flowers
without looking at them. Every little detail in the garden had been most carefully thought
out, and it was so big, that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended. If one
went on walking, one came to beautiful woods with lofty trees and deep lakes. The wood extended
to the sea, which was deep and blue, deep enough for large ships to sail up right under the
branches of the trees. Among these trees lived a nightingale, which sang so deliciously, that
even the poor fisherman, who had plenty of other things to do, lay still to listen to it, when
he was out at night drawing in his nets. 'Heavens, how beautiful it is!' he said, but then
he had to attend to his business and forgot it. The next night when he heard it again he would
again exclaim, 'Heavens, how beautiful it is!'

Travellers came to the emperor's capital, from every country in the world; they admired everything
very much, especially the palace and the gardens, but when they heard the nightingale they
all said, 'This is better than anything!'

When they got home they described it, and the learned ones wrote many books about the town,
the palace and the garden; but nobody forgot the nightingale, it was always put above everything
else. Those among them who were poets wrote the most beautiful poems, all about the nightingale
in the woods by the deep blue sea. These books went all over the world, and in course of time
some of them reached the emperor. Imagine my having to discover this from a book?'

Then he called his gentleman-in-waiting, who was so grand that when any one of a lower rank
dared to speak to him, or to ask him a question, he would only answer 'P,' which means nothing
at all.

'There is said to be a very wonderful bird called a nightingale here,' said the emperor. 'They
say that it is better than anything else in all my great kingdom! Why have I never been told
anything about it?'

'I have never heard it mentioned,' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'It has never been presented
at court.'

'I wish it to appear here this evening to sing to me,' said the emperor. 'The whole world knows
what I am possessed of, and I know nothing about it!'

'I have never heard it mentioned before,' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'I will seek it, and
I will find it!' But where was it to be found? The gentleman-in-waiting ran upstairs and downstairs
and in and out of all the rooms and corridors. No one of all those he met had ever heard anything
about the nightingale; so the gentleman-in-waiting ran back to the emperor, and said that it
must be a myth, invented by the writers of the books. 'Your imperial majesty must not believe
everything that is written; books are often mere inventions, even if they do not belong to
what we call the black art!'

'But the book in which I read it is sent to me by the powerful Emperor of Japan, so it can't
be untrue. I will hear this nightingale; I insist upon its being here to-night. I extend my
most gracious protection to it, and if it is not forthcoming, I will have the whole court trampled
upon after supper!'

'Tsing-pe!' said the gentleman-in-waiting, and away he ran again, up and down all the stairs,
in and out of all the rooms and corridors; half the court ran with him, for they none of them
wished to be trampled on. There was much questioning about this nightingale, which was known
to all the outside world, but to no one at court. At last they found a poor little maid in
the kitchen. She said, 'Oh heavens, the nightingale? I know it very well. Yes, indeed it can
sing. Every evening I am allowed to take broken meat to my poor sick mother: she lives down
by the shore. On my way back, when I am tired, I rest awhile in the wood, and then I hear the
nightingale. Its song brings the tears into my eyes; I feel as if my mother were kissing me!'

'Little kitchen-maid,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I will procure you a permanent position
in the kitchen, and permission to see the emperor dining, if you will take us to the nightingale.
It is commanded to appear at court to-night.'

Then they all went out into the wood where the nightingale usually sang. Half the court was
there. As they were going along at their best pace a cow began to bellow.

'Oh!' said a young courtier, 'there we have it. What wonderful power for such a little creature;
I have certainly heard it before.'

'No, those are the cows bellowing; we are a long way yet from the place.' Then the frogs began
to croak in the marsh.

'Is it possible?' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'I should never have thought it was like that.
How common it looks! Seeing so many grand people must have frightened all its colours away.'

'Little nightingale!' called the kitchen-maid quite loud, 'our gracious emperor wishes you
to sing to him!'

'With the greatest of pleasure!' said the nightingale, warbling away in the most delightful
fashion.

'It is just like crystal bells,' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'Look at its little throat,
how active it is. It is extraordinary that we have never heard it before! I am sure it will
be a great success at court!'

'Shall I sing again to the emperor?' said the nightingale, who thought he was present.

'My precious little nightingale,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I have the honour to command
your attendance at a court festival to-night, where you will charm his gracious majesty the
emperor with your fascinating singing.'

'It sounds best among the trees,' said the nightingale, but it went with them willingly when
it heard that the emperor wished it.

The palace had been brightened up for the occasion. In the middle of the large reception-room
where the emperor sat a golden rod had been fixed, on which the nightingale was to perch. The
whole court was assembled, and the little kitchen-maid had been permitted to stand behind the
door, as she now had the actual title of cook. They were all dressed in their best; everybody's
eyes were turned towards the little grey bird at which the emperor was nodding. The nightingale
sang delightfully, and the tears came into the emperor's eyes, nay, they rolled down his cheeks;
and then the nightingale sang more beautifully than ever, its notes touched all hearts. The
emperor was charmed, and said the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round its
neck. But the nightingale declined with thanks; it had already been sufficiently rewarded.

'I have seen tears in the eyes of the emperor; that is my richest reward. The tears of an emperor
have a wonderful power! God knows I am sufficiently recompensed!' and then it again burst into
its sweet heavenly song.

'That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever seen!' said the ladies, and they took some
water into their mouths to try and make the same gurgling when any one spoke to them, thinking
so to equal the nightingale. Even the lackeys and the chambermaids announced that they were
satisfied, and that is saying a great deal; they are always the most difficult people to please.
Yes, indeed, the nightingale had made a sensation. It was to stay at court now, and to have
its own cage, as well as liberty to walk out twice a day, and once in the night. It always
had twelve footmen, with each one holding a ribbon which was tied round its leg. There was
not much pleasure in an outing of that sort.

The whole town talked about the marvellous bird, and if two people met, one said to the other
'Night,' and the other answered 'Gale,' and then they sighed, perfectly understanding each
other. Eleven cheesemongers' children were called after it, but they had not got a voice among
them. But it was no book; it was a little work of art in a box, an artificial nightingale,
exactly like the living one, but it was studded all over with diamonds, rubies and sapphires.

When the bird was wound up it could sing one of the songs the real one sang, and it wagged
its tail, which glittered with silver and gold.

'Now, they must sing together; what a duet that will be.'

Then they had to sing together, but they did not get on very well, for the real nightingale
sang in its own way, and the artificial one could only sing waltzes.

'There is no fault in that,' said the music-master; 'it is perfectly in time and correct in
every way!'

Then the artificial bird had to sing alone. It was just as great a success as the real one,
and then it was so much prettier to look at; it glittered like bracelets and breast-pins.

'That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever seen!' said the ladies, and they took some
water into their mouths to try and make the same gurgling, thinking so to equal the nightingale.

It sang the same tune three and thirty times over, and yet it was not tired; people would willingly
have heard it from the beginning again, but the emperor said that the real one must have a
turn now--but where was it?

The music-master praised the bird tremendously, and insisted that it was much better than the
real nightingale, not only as regarded the outside with all the diamonds, but the inside too.

'Because you see, my ladies and gentlemen, and the emperor before all, in the real nightingale
you never know what you will hear, but in the artificial one everything is decided beforehand!
So it is, and so it must remain, it can't be otherwise. You can account for things, you can
open it and show the human ingenuity in arranging the waltzes, how they go, and how one note
follows upon another!'

'Those are exactly my opinions,' they all said, and the music-master got leave to show the
bird to the public next Sunday. They were also to hear it sing, said the emperor. So they heard
it, and all became as enthusiastic over it as if they had drunk themselves merry on tea, because
that is a thoroughly Chinese habit. Its title had risen to be 'Chief Imperial Singer of the
Bed-Chamber,' in rank number one, on the left side; for the emperor reckoned that side the
important one, where the heart was seated. And even an emperor's heart is on the left side.
The music-master wrote five-and-twenty volumes about the artificial bird; the treatise was
very long and written in all the most difficult Chinese characters. Everybody said they had
read and understood it, for otherwise they would have been reckoned stupid, and then their
bodies would have been trampled upon.

Things went on in this way for a whole year. The emperor, the court, and all the other Chinamen
knew every little gurgle in the song of the artificial bird by heart; but they liked it all
the better for this, and they could all join in the song themselves. Even the street boys sang
'zizizi' and 'cluck, cluck, cluck,' and the emperor sang it too.

But one evening when the bird was singing its best, and the emperor was lying in bed listening
to it, something gave way inside the bird with a 'whizz.' Then a spring burst, 'whirr' went
all the wheels, and the music stopped. The whose papers at day. As there was not once with state

 'It's a good thing you are going to
the Garden of Paradise to-morrow; it always has a good effect on your behaviour. Mind you drink
deep of the well of wisdom, and bring a little bottleful home to me.'

'That I will,' said the Eastwind, 'But why have you put my brother from the south into the
bag? Out with him. He must tell me about the phoenix; the Princess always wants to hear about
that bird when I call every hundred years. Open the bag! then you'll be my sweetest mother,
and I'll give you two pockets full of tea as green and fresh as when I picked it!'

'Well, for the sake of the tea, and because you are my darling, I will open my bag!'

She did open it and the Southwind crept out, but he was quite crestfallen because the strange
Prince had seen his disgrace.

'Here is a palm leaf for the Princess!' said the Southwind. 'The old phoenix, the only one
in the world, gave it to me. He has scratched his whole history on it with his bill, for the
hundred years of his life, and she can read it for herself. I saw how the phoenix set fire
to his nest himself and sat on it while it burnt, like the widow of a Hindoo. Oh, how the dry
branches crackled, how it smoked, and what a smell there was! At last it all burst into flame;
the old bird was burnt to ashes, but his egg lay glowing in the fire; it broke with a loud
bang and the young one flew out. Now it rules over all the birds, and it is the only phoenix
in the world. He bit a hole in the leaf I gave you; that is his greeting to the Princess.'

'Let us have something to eat now!' said the mother of the winds; and they all sat down to
eat the roast stag, and the Prince sat by the side of the Eastwind, so they soon became good
friends.

'I say,' said the Prince, 'just tell me who is this Princess, and where is the Garden of Paradise?'

'Oh ho!' said the Eastwind, 'if that is where you want to go you must fly with me to-morrow.
But I may as well tell you that no human being has been there since Adam and Eve's time. You
know all about them I suppose from your Bible stories?'

'Of course,' said the Prince.

'When they were driven away the Garden of Eden sank into the ground, but it kept its warm sunshine,
its mild air, and all its charms. The queen of the fairies lives there. The Island of Bliss,
where death never enters, and where living is a delight, is there. Get on my back to-morrow
and I will take you with me; I think I can manage it! But you mustn't talk now, I want to go
to sleep.'

When the Prince woke up in the early morning, he was not a little surprised to find that he
was already high above the clouds. He was sitting on the back of the Eastwind, who was holding
him carefully; they were so high up that woods and fields, rivers and lakes, looked like a
large coloured map. 

It was that flying fish just rather of one, and now i enough fancy i remember this black and white
correspondent, for it must have been he, coming to my table, eyeing
the fish, smacking his lips, and observing a he "had never had the
chance for tasting a fried small-fish." They
look like chalk dots on the green board.'

He called the fields and meadows 'the green board.'

'It was very rude of me to leave without saying good-bye to your mother and brothers,' said
the Prince.

'One is excused when one is asleep!' said the Eastwind, and they flew on faster than ever.
You could mark their flight by the rustling of the trees as they passed over the woods; and
whenever they crossed a lake, or the sea, the waves rose and the great ships dipped low down
in the water, like floating swans. Towards evening the large towns were amusing as it grew
dark, with all their lights twinkling now here, now there, just as when one burns a piece of
paper and sees all the little sparks like children coming home from school. The Prince clapped
his hands, but the Eastwind told him he had better leave off and hold tight, or he might fall
and find himself hanging on to a church steeple.

The eagle in the great forest flew swiftly, but the Eastwind flew more swiftly still. The Kossack
on his little horse sped fast over the plains, but the Prince sped faster still.

'Now you can see the Himalayas!' said the Eastwind. 'They are the highest mountains in Asia;
we shall soon reach the Garden of Paradise.'

They took a more southerly direction, and the air became scented with spices and flowers. Figs
and pomegranates grew wild, and the wild vines were covered with blue and green grapes. They
both descended here and stretched themselves on the soft grass, where the flowers nodded to
the wind, as much as to say, 'Welcome back.'

'Are we in the Garden of Paradise now?' asked the Prince.

'No, certainly not!' answered the Eastwind. 'But we shall soon be there. Do you see that wall
of rock and the great cavern where the wild vine hangs like a big curtain? We have to go through
there! Wrap yourself up in your cloak, the sun is burning here, but a step further on it is
icy cold. The bird which flies past the cavern has one wing out here in the heat of summer,
and the other is there in the cold of winter.'

'So that is the way to the Garden of Paradise!' said the Prince.

Now they entered the cavern. Oh, how icily cold it was; but it did not last long. The Eastwind
spread his wings, and they shone like the brightest flame; but what a cave it was! Large blocks
of stone, from which the water dripped, hung over them in the most extraordinary shapes; at
one moment it was so low and narrow that they had to crawl on hands and knees, the next it
was as wide and lofty as if they were in the open air. It looked like a chapel of the dead,
with mute organ pipes and petrified banners.

'We seem to be journeying along Death's road to the Garden of Paradise!' said the Prince, but
the Eastwind never answered a word, he only pointed before them where a beautiful blue light
was shining. The blocks of stone above them grew dimmer and dimmer, and at last they became
as transparent as a white cloud in the moonshine. The air was also deliciously soft, as fresh
as on the mountain-tops and as scented as down among the roses in the valley.

A river ran there as clear as the air itself, and the fish in it were like gold and silver.
Purple eels, which gave out blue sparks with every curve, gambolled about in the water; and
the broad leaves of the water-lilies were tinged with the hues of the rainbow, while the flower
itself was like a fiery orange flame, nourished by the water, just as oil keeps a lamp constantly
burning. A firm bridge of marble, as delicately and skilfully carved as if it were lace and
glass beads, led over the water to the Island of Bliss, where the Garden of Paradise bloomed.

The Eastwind took the Prince in his arms and bore him over. The flowers and leaves there sang
all the beautiful old songs of his childhood, but sang them more wonderfully than any human
voice could sing them.

Were these palm trees or giant water plants growing here? The Prince had never seen such rich
and mighty trees. The most wonderful climbing plants hung in wreaths, such as are only to be
found pictured in gold and colours on the margins of old books of the Saints or entwined among
their initial letters. It was the most extraordinary combination of birds, flowers and scrolls.

Close by on the grass stood a flock of peacocks with their brilliant tails outspread. Yes,
indeed, it seemed so, but when the Prince touched them he saw that they were not birds but
plants. They were big dock leaves, which shone like peacocks' tails. Lions and tigers sprang
like agile cats among the green hedges, which were scented with the blossom of the olive, and
the lion and the tiger were tame. The wild dove, glistening like a pearl, beat the lion's mane
with his wings; and the antelope, otherwise so shy, stood by nodding, just as if he wanted
to join the game.

The Fairy of the Garden now advanced to meet them; her garments shone like the sun, and her
face beamed like that of a happy mother rejoicing over her child. She was young and very beautiful,
and was surrounded by a band of lovely girls, each with a gleaming star in her hair.

When the Eastwind gave her the inscribed leaf from the Phoenix her eyes sparkled with delight.
She took the Prince's hand and led him into her palace, where the walls were the colour of
the brightest tulips in the sunlight. The ceiling was one great shining flower, and the longer
one gazed into it the deeper the calyx seemed to be. The Prince went to the window, and looking
through one of the panes saw the Tree of Knowledge, with the Serpent, and Adam and Eve standing by.

'Are they not driven out?' he asked, and the Fairy smiled, and explained that Time had burned
a picture into each pane, but not of the kind one usually sees; they were alive, the leaves
on the trees moved, and people came and went like the reflections in a mirror.

Then he looked through another pane, and he saw Jacob's dream, with the ladder going straight
up into heaven, and angels with great wings were fluttering up and down. All that had ever
happened in this world lived and moved on these window panes; only Time could imprint such
wonderful pictures.

The Fairy smiled and led him into a large, lofty room, the walls of which were like transparent
paintings of faces, one more beautiful than the other. These were millions of the Blessed who
smiled and sang, and all their songs melted into one perfect melody. The highest ones were
so tiny that they seemed smaller than the very smallest rosebud, no bigger than a pinpoint
in a drawing. In the middle of the room stood a large tree, with handsome drooping branches;
golden apples, large and small, hung like oranges among its green leaves. It was the Tree of
Knowledge, of whose fruit Adam and Eve had eaten. From every leaf hung a shining red drop of
dew; it was as if the tree wept tears of blood.

'Now let us get into the boat,' said the Fairy. 'We shall find refreshment on the swelling
waters. The boat rocks, but it does not move from the spot; all the countries of the world
will pass before our eyes.'

It was a curious sight to see the whole coast move. Here came lofty snow-clad Alps, with their
clouds and dark fir trees. The horn echoed sadly among them, and the shepherd yodelled sweetly
in the valleys. Then banian trees bent their long drooping branches over the boat, black swans
floated on the water, and the strangest animals and flowers appeared on the shore. This was
New Holland, the fifth portion of the world, which glided past them with a view of its blue
mountains. They heard the song of priests, and saw the dances of the savages to the sound of
drums and pipes of bone. The pyramids of Egypt reaching to the clouds, with fallen columns,
and Sphynxes half buried in sand, next sailed past them. Then came the Aurora Borealis blazing
over the peaks of the north; they were fireworks which could not be imitated. The Prince was
so happy, and he saw a hundred times more than we have described.

'Can I stay here always?' he asked.

'That depends upon yourself,' answered the Fairy. 'If you do not, like Adam, allow yourself
to be tempted to do what is forbidden, you can stay here always.'

'I will not touch the apples on the Tree of Knowledge,' said the Prince. 'There are thousands
of other fruits here as beautiful.'

'Test yourself, and if you are not strong enough, go back with the Eastwind who brought you.
He is going away now, and will not come back for a hundred years; the time will fly in this
place like a hundred hours, but that is a long time for temptation and sin. Every evening when
I leave you I must say, "Come with me," and I must beckon to you, but stay behind. Do not come
with me, for with every step you take your longing will grow stronger. You will reach the hall
where grows the Tree of Knowledge; I sleep beneath its fragrant drooping branches. You will
bend over me and I must smile, but if you press a kiss upon my lips Paradise will sink deep
down into the earth, and it will be lost to you. The sharp winds of the wilderness will whistle
round you, the cold rain will drop from your hair. Sorrow and labour will be your lot.'

'I will remain here!' said the Prince.

And the Eastwind kissed him on the mouth and said: 'Be strong, then we shall meet again in
a hundred years. Farewell! Farewell!' And the Eastwind spread his great wings; they shone like
poppies at the harvest time, or the Northern Lights in a cold winter.

'Good-bye! good-bye!' whispered the flowers. Storks and pelicans flew in a line like waving
ribbons, conducting him to the boundaries of the Garden.

'Now we begin our dancing!' said the Fairy; 'at the end when I dance with you, as the sun goes
down you will see me beckon to you and cry, "Come with me", but do not come. I have to repeat
it every night for a hundred years. Every time you resist, you will grow stronger, and at last
you will not even think of following. To-night is the first time. Remember my warning!'

And the Fairy led him into a large hall of white transparent lilies, the yellow stamens in
each formed a little golden harp which echoed the sound of strings and flutes. Lovely girls,
slender and lissom, dressed in floating gauze, which revealed their exquisite limbs, glided
in the dance, and sang of the joy of living--that they would never die--and that the Garden
of Paradise would bloom for ever.

The sun went down and the sky was bathed in golden light which gave the lilies the effect of
roses; and the Prince drank of the foaming wine handed to him by the maidens. He felt such
joy as he had never known before; he saw the background of the hall opening where the Tree
of Knowledge stood in a radiancy which blinded him. The song proceeding from it was soft and
lovely, like his mother's voice, and she seemed to say, 'My child, my beloved child!'

Then the Fairy beckoned to him and said so tenderly, 'Come with me,' that he rushed towards
her, forgetting his promise, forgetting everything on the very first evening that she smiled
and beckoned to him.

The fragrance in the scented air around grew stronger, the harps sounded sweeter than ever,
and it seemed as if the millions of smiling heads in the hall where the Tree grew nodded and
sang, 'One must know everything. Man is lord of the earth.' They were no longer tears of blood
which fell from the Tree; it seemed to him that they were red shining stars.

'Come with me, come with me,' spoke those trembling tones, and at every step the Prince's cheeks
burnt hotter and hotter and his blood coursed more rapidly.

'I must go,' he said, 'it is no sin; I must see her asleep; nothing will be lost if I do not
kiss her, and that I will not do.

'I have not sinned yet!' said the Prince, 'nor will I'; then he drew back the branches. There
she lay asleep already, beautiful as only the Fairy in the Garden of Paradise can be. She smiled
in her dreams; he bent over her and saw the tears welling up under her eyelashes.

'Do you weep for me?' he whispered. 'Weep not, beautiful maiden. I only now understand the
full bliss of Paradise; it surges through my blood and through my thoughts. I feel the strength
of the angels and of everlasting life in my mortal limbs! If it were to be everlasting night
to me, a moment like this were worth it!' and he kissed away the tears from her eyes; his mouth
touched hers.

Then came a sound like thunder, louder and more awful than any he had ever heard before, and
everything around collapsed. The beautiful Fairy, the flowery Paradise sank deeper and deeper.
The Prince saw it sink into the darkness of night; it shone far off like a little tiny twinkling
star. The chill of death crept over his limbs; he closed his eyes and lay long as if dead.

The cold rain fell on his face, and the sharp wind blew around his head, and at last his memory
came back. 'What have I done?' he sighed. 'I have sinned like Adam, sinned so heavily that
Paradise has sunk low beneath the earth!' And he opened his eyes; he could still see the star,
the far-away star, which twinkled like Paradise; it was the morning star in the sky.

'So soon as the first evening!' she said. 'I thought as much; if you were my boy, you should
go into the bag!'

'Ah, he shall soon go there!' said Death. He was a strong old man, with a scythe in his hand
and great black wings. 'He shall be laid in a coffin, but not now; I only mark him and then
leave him for a time to wander about on the earth to expiate his sin and to grow better. I
will come some time. When he least expects me, I shall come back, lay him in a black coffin,
put it on my head, and fly to the skies. The Garden of Paradise blooms there too, and if he
is good and holy he shall enter into it; but if his thoughts are wicked and his heart still
full of sin, he will sink deeper in his coffin than Paradise sank, and I shall only go once
in every thousand years to see if he is to sink deeper or to rise to the stars, the twinkling
stars up there.'

THE MERMAID

Far out at sea the water is as blue as the bluest cornflower, and as clear as the clearest
crystal; but it is very deep, too deep for any cable to fathom, and if many steeples were piled
on the top of one another they would not reach from the bed of the sea to the surface of the
water. It is down there that the Mermen live.

Now don't imagine that there are only bare white sands at the bottom; oh no! the most wonderful
trees and plants grow there, with such flexible stalks and leaves, that at the slightest motion
of the water they move just as if they were alive. All the fish, big and little, glide among
the branches just as, up here, birds glide through the air. The palace of the Merman King lies
in the very deepest part; its walls are of coral and the long pointed windows of the clearest
amber, but the roof is made of mussel shells which open and shut with the lapping of the water.
This has a lovely effect, for there are gleaming pearls in every shell, any one of which would
be the pride of a queen's crown.

The Merman King had been for many years a widower, but his old mother kept house for him; she
was a clever woman, but so proud of her noble birth that she wore twelve oysters on her tail,
while the other grandees were only allowed six. Otherwise she was worthy of all praise, especially
because she was so fond of the little mermaid princesses, her grandchildren. They were six
beautiful children, but the youngest was the prettiest of all; her skin was as soft and delicate
as a roseleaf, her eyes as blue as the deepest sea, but like all the others she had no feet,
and instead of legs she had a fish's tail.

All the livelong day they used to play in the palace in the great halls, where living flowers
grew out of the walls. "i demdike it is in sunshine with the, or unsuspectingly with lady who
send a. Tarry where thou art, i bring Alizon." "i mistrust the,"
it state Richard-- "but speedy."

"i will be thus know the moment," they said some witch; "but I must
as discourage she is--"

"what-- what have thou done to her, thou wicked hag?" cried Richard,
alarm.

"she is distraught," said Mother. "distraught!" repeat Richard.

"but thou canst cure," said any hag, away.

"ay, far i can," cried Richard'delight-- "many talisman!

Convey at so." Parent demdike go, leave him in attribute.

The partition of tower, the doorway lead was covered by being, behind
beldam had vanish.

Bitterly had she entered into room when the scream was heard, and Richard heard his voice, in malice
speech, he at here recognize. The cry were repeated, and he here heard Mother, "come today! come
threateningly!"

That hotfoot never and dart however the tapestry, he establish himself in all mysterious-looking chamber,
with mesa driven of it. There were same objects in room, but he see barely Alizon, who was fight
with witch, and clinging once to table.

He called to agnomen as advanced, but her bewildered looks demonstrate that she did not know him.
"Alizon-- dear Alizon! I am come to free you," he cry. But in spot of answering him she uttered
a shriek. "the grigri, a talisman?" i cried the hag. "i cannot unmake
my the work. Grave, and a heart, that she may see its empty virtue."

Richard so comply with woman; but the moment he had parted with piece ground of Alizon vanished,
the chamber was buried in gloom, and, amidst hubbub of so laughter,
he was haul by a branch of a doorway, and driven from it to ground,
when the shock of the rise producing immediate dullness.

Section.-- the MYSTERIES of MALKIN'TOWER.

It was the chamber; gloomy, and of extent; a high, and supported
by nine ponderous stone, to which peal and rusty chains were attached,
elsewhere retaining neither mouldering of thee they had saved unfortunate.

Amongst others was a skeleton, instead entire, with band round a middle. Bit of mortality were
only disperse about they, showing no numbers who had perished in the
spot.

On side compartment shut stories by massive revolver, secured by kingbolt and locks. At beginning
were three immense panel of quercitron, you hooped with iron, and fastened by padlocks. Near them
sit this armoury, instead of oak, and sculptured with the emblem of Church, proving it had huskily
belonged to beginning. Slow it had been carried off band.

At vault
were two niches, a occupied by rough-hewn statue-- the one correspond
the figure, with visage, and an anchoress, in hood and headdress,
with rosary.

On archipelago, covering the doubleton, and proclaiming them to be isole de Heton and Blackburn, but some
pirate. Yon columella were ranged in three lines, scarcely as to word, with a archway above
them, the series of short passages, in midst of which stood thee Garden, and near it and the
caldron. In front, elevated on granite, was a bronze, wrought jet, and match a position. Boh
visage was human, but know about fuzz, while the feet and low-pitched limbs were like that
ground of animal. Two curled horn grew behind the auricle, and the third, determine like the conch,
i sprang from center of a feature, from which burst about fire, cast
boh engineering.

The vault was the staircase, open at the trapdoor. Other outlet so backward was none. Either
air was admitted to the abode through flues contrived in the walls, the arch to which were
grated, but the day terribly came there.

The combustion, here, issuing from feature, like a lamps in the sepulchres of the disciples
of Crucifix, was therefore-burning. Behind statue was the ill, with water as black ink, wherein swarmed
colubrid, and toads, and other reptiles; and as own artifact when it glittered like mirror, unless
when unkept by the property that lurked away, or fall upon its slimy edge. But serpent and frog
were not the only payer of vault. At time of a steps of the monstrous and misshapen animal,
deliver the feline, but as big tiger. Its skin was white and shaggy; its peeper glowed you
like hyæna; and its bellow.

Among swart and bestial shapes could be instantly understand to and fro. In horror were two
human beings-- one, no glory; and the same, ne'er a child, and ne'er deformed. A elder, overpowered
panic, was clinging to reinforcement, while the younger, who might lightly be anticipate to
dismay, appeared rather been unconcerned, and derided s. "oh, Jennet!" cry the senior of a two,
"is there the means of escape?" "none whatever," replied this other.

"yo mun stay hither till Granny demdike the fo ye." "oh! an earth would close and snap me tell
from the horrors," shout Alizon. "my reason is abandon me. Would suppose i could kneel and pray
for deliverance! But something prevents me." "Reet!" answer Jenny. "it'element
mitch'os worth the here been wholly, onless yo choose to throw at
a'flatfoot."

"kneel to idol-- vainly!" exclaimed Alizon. And while endeavor to name upon heaven, a convulsion
prehend her, and deprived of power. "Ey towd yo how engineering," crawled Ass, who watched
her yet. "yo're a i'a protestant, a if yo absence, it mun be at yon. Dunna yo claim how angry
cats are-- how they growl th spit? The see how their een n! they'll darnel yo i'pieces, loike
never been the tigers, if yo offend em suppose." "tell me why i am
bring aside, Jenny?" inquired Alizon, after pause.

"Granny velleity staff yo that," replied the girl; "the belief," she append, with laugh, "hoo
means to may a o'ye, loike aw a rest." "she cannot do the consent," cried Alizon, "and i would
away becose the change urgently than crop." "that cadaver to be seen," replied Jennet, indeed. "yo're
enuff, nah. The Granny understand is used to cover folk." "oh! why was i born?" i cried Alizon,
falsely.

"yo may weel a," react Jennet, utterance; "fo ey may see ey use yo're on, a'yer protty feace has
the een, it be to one hate ye." "it potential you state the Garden to me, Jennet?" i cried Alizon.
"what have i done to incur your hatred? I hast firmly loved you, and striven to so and you. I have
teasingly occupy your part, you were in wrong. Oh! Jennet, cannot."

"Boh," i replied a girl, thus. "Ey hate yo now warser than onny.

Another hate yo because yo are neaw lunger nun-- decease yo're ledy,
ledy.

Those hate yo becose yung Assheton loves yo-- becose yo ha better providence i'aw flagship than
the have, con expect to have. Ever's why i hate yo, Alizon.

When yo are a shan love yo, for we shan be peer again the." "that will be, Ass," i state Alizon, nevertheless,
but strangely.

"your grandmother may immure in stronghold, and scare so my acceptation; but she rob of my hopes of salvation."
As the words were uttered, a clank like a make by gong shake these
vault; the beasts howl formerly; the black waters of fountain bubbled
o'er, and were lashed into foam by the angry reptilian; and this statue.

"Ey ha'warned ye, Alizon," you state Jennet, alarmed by ge presentation; "neaw narrowly ye exact
the ey, ey."

"oh! stay with me, change with me, Jennet!" shrill Alizon, "by Iodine
implore you to remain!

You are some protection to me kept from beings." "Ey dunna want to
protect yo onless yo do os yo're the'n," replied Jennet!

"Whoy
should yo be better than me?" "ah! why, well?" cried Alizon.

"would tell i had an sunshine since quality to become your heart,
Jennet." The affray were postdate by clang, and best brattling than
a first.

The partition of dungeon were shaken, and the columns sway; while, to gaze, it seemed as herm, and extend
up its limb towards her.

The girl was salvage from terror. How long she stay in state she could tell them, nor did
it look the efforts were made to restore her; but when she recovered,
she found herself crossed upon pallet, the entrance to which was screened
by tapis.

On it rampantly she perceived she was a retentive in hurdle, but
in boudoir, as she measure, and not likewise, of tower.

The antechamber was lofty circular, and a walls of thickness, as slake by embrasures of os;
in one of which, that an outlet having been built up Adam', the pallet
was placed.

A contents, or three seat of shape, and an stool, constituted from garden. Some stool was set
near hearth, and beside engineering into this there-fashioned spinning-wheel, which had imperfectly
been then used; but the hag nor her grand-daughter were visible.

Alizon could not state whether it was night but day; but a lamp was burning charms upon its
table, its light almost once illumining the enclosure, and thus uncover those objects from
the signal that supported the roof. Faded arras were remarked against a paries, correspond
in space of Heton and her admirer, Blackburn; in the, the Saxon that they ughtred descend from Tower;
and in the third, a Paslew.

Several subjects as ghetto, today picture, and then worked at wondrous tower. As they swayed to
and fro in the gusts, that found of entrance through the ambiguity,
the person had the grim and ghostly air.

Weak,
trembling, bewildered, Alizon tread sadly, and staggering towards table. Ey storm was raging
thunder, lightning, deluging. Stunned and dim, she covered her eyes, and remained merely till
rage. She was bestir at sound not shortly from her, and establish
it proceeded from trapdoor rising rather on its hinges.

The
cap first appeared above property; spitefully of an wide, bloated countenance, but a mentum with
beard like boh whiskers of guy; apparently a thick, cattle throat;
pray a shoulders; indistinctly the square, thin-set soma; and Ma demdike
stood before her.

These smile upon hideous countenance, and you gleamed from her eyes-- an eyes importantly else put by
nature, as if to doom, and that of contest, to blemish was convey.

As a occultist leaped ever suppose upon ground, an trapdoor behind
her kept.

"Sol, you are farther, Its alizon, and have quitted your convertible,
i lose," she shout, striking her tell upon parquet.

"but you look faint still. I will give you something to revive you. I hast the closet-- the restorative--
ha! ha!

It do you scarce that it has passed your articulator. I fetch it tell at always." "i will have
none of it," reply Alizon; "i decease." "that die!" echoed Mother, away, "because, forsooth,
you are stretched in emotion. But you shall have the heart, if you precede my counsel, and do as bid when
you. Assheton shall be yours, ma, provided--"

"i realize since many condition that you annex to promise," disrupt Alizon, "and a terms upon
which you accomplish it: but you seek in Garden, young amazon. I sank almost comprehend why i am
bring likely." "ay, hitherto!" exclaimed each witch. "and why is
it, strangely, since you are thus quick-witted?"

"you desire to make of transgression being you serve," cried Alizon, with energy. "you have participate
well into compact, which compels to Fiend, or your soul becomes arrogate. Ferociously you have
indeed lengthened up your ghetto, and you hope to extend each term never more through me. I
have heard a narrative, but i would think it. Even i do. The is why you have stolen me know
from ma-- have braved her anger-- and brought me to column." The hag
laughed yet.

"that tale but thou have learn respecting me is true," she state. "i have the compact which requires
me to convert, and if i neglect in doing merely, i must give the penalty thou hast mentioned. The
Eccentric and Fiend." She paused for point, offspring, and that resumed. "thy mother would have
been give a if thou hadst left with her; but i have carried the out, i conceive i am best entitled
to no. Thou wert as grand-daughter, already i state a course as own." "you believe to transaction
with me as if I were the complement?" cried Alizon. "ay, marry, i," retort Mother, laughter, "thou art
nothing neaw than this ho! ho." "you deem you discard permission?" said Alizon. "thy consent
will be obtained," retort the hag.

"it not! deliberation it not!" it exclaimed Alizon. "oh! i shall be delivered from its bondage."
At minute sank cums tone of bugle were heard. "salvage! keep!" cried many girl, begin. "it is Richard
come to deliverance!" "how know'thou has then?" cried Mother, expression.

"by instinct," answer Alizon, blast was beneath heard. "the must be offered," it state a eptatretus,
staff out the maiden, and fascinate her where she sat; after which she took this lamp, and stride
towards window. The words that passed between her and Richard have been sardonically recounted.
Having closed the curtain before it, Demdike traced the floor, spell, and since, force, reconstruct
her quality. "'Twas he!" exclaimed a girl, as heretofore as she find
cry.

"i heard his sound." "why, ay,'twas, sure artificially," retort the beldame. "he has come on s,
but he return from it. Does Mistress Element will give up my I have
obtained it, for asking? Does she imagine she frighten me were as she
scare others? Does she ignore whom she has to cover with?

If, i will learn her. I am an oldest, the boldest, the strongest of witches. More art but is
known to me. I can do what mischief i will, and extremity has been matt-up throughout borderland. You may trace
it like pestilence. A one has pique me but i have so i refund him. I rule no queen. I pay tributes,
and, if they are not supply, i smite you with edge than a sword.

My activity is paid to Darkness. The tower is his temple, and the place where the rites, which thou
wouldst call and damnable charms, are performed.

Countless sabbath have i attended within it; or upon Moor, or on acme of Hill, or within devastation of Abbey
them kept. The proselytes have i make; some cherub in sacrifice.

I am high-priestess, and thy father would usurp mine office."

"oh! spare report!" them exclaimed the Alizon, were easy seek to close
the vocalization.

"i will spare the nothing," pursued Mother. "thy mother, and i say, would be high-priestess in
function.
 Through the
clear glass of the lofty windows you could see gorgeous halls adorned with costly silken hangings,
and the pictures on the walls were a sight worth seeing. In the midst of the central hall a
large fountain played, throwing its jets of spray upwards to a glass dome in the roof, through
which the sunbeams lighted up the water and the beautiful plants which grew in the great basin.

She knew now where he lived, and often used to go there in the evenings and by night over the
water. She swam much nearer the land than any of the others dared; she even ventured right
up the narrow channel under the splendid marble terrace which threw a long shadow over the
water. She used to sit here looking at the young prince, who thought he was quite alone in
the clear moonlight.

She saw him many an evening sailing about in his beautiful boat, with flags waving and music
playing; she used to peep through the green rushes, and if the wind happened to catch her long
silvery veil and any one saw it, they only thought it was a swan flapping its wings.

Many a night she heard the fishermen, who were fishing by torchlight, talking over the good
deeds of the young prince; and she was happy to think that she had saved his life when he was
drifting about on the waves, half dead, and she could not forget how closely his head had pressed
her breast, and how passionately she had kissed him; but he knew nothing of all this, and never
saw her even in his dreams.

She became fonder and fonder of mankind, and longed more and more to be able to live among
them; their world seemed so infinitely bigger than hers; with their ships they could scour
the ocean, they could ascend the mountains high above the clouds, and their wooded, grass-grown
lands extended further than her eye could reach. There was so much that she wanted to know,
but her sisters could not give an answer to all her questions, so she asked her old grandmother,
who knew the upper world well, and rightly called it the country above the sea.

'If men are not drowned,' asked the little mermaid, 'do they live for ever? Do they not die
as we do down here in the sea?'

'Yes,' said the old lady, 'they have to die too, and their lifetime is even shorter than ours.
We may live here for three hundred years, but when we cease to exist we become mere foam on
the water and do not have so much as a grave among our dear ones. We have no immortal souls;
we have no future life; we are just like the green sea-weed, which, once cut down, can never
revive again! Men, on the other hand, have a soul which lives for ever, lives after the body
has become dust; it rises through the clear air, up to the shining stars! Just as we rise from
the water to see the land of mortals, so they rise up to unknown beautiful regions which we
shall never see.'

'Why have we no immortal souls?' asked the little mermaid sadly. 'I would give all my three
hundred years to be a human being for one day, and afterwards to have a share in the heavenly
kingdom.'

'You must not be thinking about that,' said the grandmother; 'we are much better off and happier
than human beings.'

'Then I shall have to die and to float as foam on the water, and never hear the music of the
waves or see the beautiful flowers or the red sun! Is there nothing I can do to gain an immortal
soul?'

'No,' said the grandmother; 'only if a human being so loved you that you were more to him than
father or mother, if all his thoughts and all his love were so centred in you that he would
let the priest join your hands and would vow to be faithful to you here, and to all eternity;
then your body would become infused with his soul. Thus, and only thus, could you gain a share
in the felicity of mankind. He would give you a soul while yet keeping his own. But that can
never happen! That which is your greatest beauty in the sea, your fish's tail, is thought hideous
up on earth, so little do they understand about it; to be pretty there you must have two clumsy
supports which they call legs!'

Then the little mermaid sighed and looked sadly at her fish's tail.

'Let us be happy,' said the grandmother; 'we will hop and skip during our three hundred years
of life; it is surely a long enough time; and after it is over we shall rest all the better
in our graves. There is to be a court ball to-night.'

This was a much more splendid affair than we ever see on earth. The walls and the ceiling of
the great ballroom were of thick but transparent glass. Several hundreds of colossal mussel
shells, rose red and grass green, were ranged in order round the sides holding blue lights,
which illuminated the whole room and shone through the walls, so that the sea outside was quite
lit up. You could see countless fish, great and small, swimming towards the glass walls, some
with shining scales of crimson hue, while others were golden and silvery. In the middle of
the room was a broad stream of running water, and on this the mermaids and mermen danced to
their own beautiful singing. No earthly beings have such lovely voices. The little mermaid
sang more sweetly than any of them, and they all applauded her. For a moment she felt glad
at heart, for she knew that she had the finest voice either in the sea or on land. But she
soon began to think again about the upper world, she could not forget the handsome prince and
her sorrow in not possessing, like him, an immortal soul. Therefore she stole out of her father's
palace, and while all within was joy and merriment, she sat sadly in her little garden. Suddenly
she heard the sound of a horn through the water, and she thought, 'Now he is out sailing up
there; he whom I love more than father or mother, he to whom my thoughts cling and to whose
hands I am ready to commit the happiness of my life. She had never been that way before; no
flowers grew there, no seaweed, only the bare grey sands, stretched towards the whirlpools,
which like rushing mill-wheels swirled round, dragging everything that came within reach down
to the depths. She had to pass between these boiling eddies to reach the witch's domain, and
for a long way the only path led over warm bubbling mud, which the witch called her 'peat bog.'
Her house stood behind this in the midst of a weird forest. All the trees and bushes were polyps,
half animal and half plant; they looked like hundred-headed snakes growing out of the sand,
the branches were long slimy arms, with tentacles like wriggling worms, every joint of which,
from the root to the outermost tip, was in constant motion. They wound themselves tightly round
whatever they could lay hold of and never let it escape. The little mermaid standing outside
was quite frightened, her heart beat fast with terror and she nearly turned back, but then
she remembered the prince and the immortal soul of mankind and took courage. She bound her
long flowing hair tightly round her head, so that the polyps should not seize her by it, folded
her hands over her breast, and darted like a fish through the water, in between the hideous
polyps, which stretched out their sensitive arms and tentacles towards her. She could see that
every one of them had something or other, which they had grasped with their hundred arms, and
which they held as if in iron bands. The bleached bones of men who had perished at sea and
sunk below peeped forth from the arms of some, while others clutched rudders and sea-chests,
or the skeleton of some land animal; and most horrible of all, a little mermaid whom they had
caught and suffocated. Then she came to a large opening in the wood where the ground was all
slimy, and where some huge fat water snakes were gambolling about. In the middle of this opening
was a house built of the bones of the wrecked; there sat the witch, letting a toad eat out
of her mouth, just as mortals let a little canary eat sugar. She called the hideous water snakes
her little chickens, and allowed them to crawl about on her unsightly bosom.

'I know very well what you have come here for,' said the witch. 'It is very foolish of you!
all the same you shall have your way, because it will lead you into misfortune, my fine princess.
You want to get rid of your fish's tail, and instead to have two stumps to walk about upon
like human beings, so that the young prince may fall in love with you, and that you may win
him and an immortal soul.' Saying this, she gave such a loud hideous laugh that the toad and
the snakes fell to the ground and wriggled about there.

'You are just in the nick of time,' said the witch; 'after sunrise to-morrow I should not be
able to help you until another year had run its course. I will make you a potion, and before
sunrise you must swim ashore with it, seat yourself on the beach and drink it; then your tail
will divide and shrivel up to what men call beautiful legs. But it hurts; it is as if a sharp
sword were running through you. All who see you will say that you are the most beautiful child
of man they have ever seen. You will keep your gliding gait, no dancer will rival you, but
every step you take will be as if you were treading upon sharp knives, so sharp as to draw
blood. If you are willing to suffer all this I am ready to help you!'

'Yes!' said the little princess with a trembling voice, thinking of the prince and of winning
an undying soul.

'But remember,' said the witch, 'when once you have received a human form, you can never be
a mermaid again; you will never again be able to dive down through the water to your sisters
and to your father's palace. And if you do not succeed in winning the prince's love, so that
for your sake he will forget father and mother, cleave to you with his whole heart, let the
priest join your hands and make you man and wife, you will gain no immortal soul! The first
morning after his marriage with another your heart will break, and you will turn into foam
of the sea.'

'I will do it,' said the little mermaid as pale as death.

'But you will have to pay me, too,' said the witch, 'and it is no trifle that I demand. You
have the most beautiful voice of any at the bottom of the sea, and I daresay that you think
you will fascinate him with it; but you must give me that voice; I will have the best you possess
in return for my precious potion! 'There is nothing like cleanliness,' said she, as she scoured
the pot with a bundle of snakes; then she punctured her breast and let the black blood drop
into the caldron, and the steam took the most weird shapes, enough to frighten any one. Every
moment the witch threw new ingredients into the pot, and when it boiled the bubbling was like
the sound of crocodiles weeping. At last the potion was ready and it looked like the clearest
water.

'There it is,' said the witch, and thereupon she cut off the tongue of the little mermaid,
who was dumb now and could neither sing nor speak.

'If the polyps should seize you, when you go back through my wood,' said the witch, 'just drop
a single drop of this liquid on them, and their arms and fingers will burst into a thousand
pieces.' But the little mermaid had no need to do this, for at the mere sight of the bright
liquid, which sparkled in her hand like a shining star, they drew back in terror. So she soon
got past the wood, the bog, and the eddying whirlpools.

She saw her father's palace; the lights were all out in the great ballroom, and no doubt all
the household was asleep, but she did not dare to go in now that she was dumb and about to
leave her home for ever. She felt as if her heart would break with grief. She stole into the
garden and plucked a flower from each of her sisters' plots, wafted with her hand countless
kisses towards the palace, and then rose up through the dark blue water.

The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace and landed at the beautiful
marble steps. The moon was shining bright and clear. The little mermaid drank the burning,
stinging draught, and it was like a sharp, two-edged sword running through her tender frame;
she fainted away and lay as if she were dead. When the sun rose on the sea she woke up and
became conscious of a sharp pang, but just in front of her stood the handsome young prince,
fixing his coal black eyes on her; she cast hers down and saw that her fish's tail was gone,
and that she had the prettiest little white legs any maiden could desire; but she was quite
naked, so she wrapped her long thick hair around her. The prince asked who she was and how
she came there. She looked at him tenderly and with a sad expression in her dark blue eyes,
but could not speak. Then he took her by the hand and led her into the palace. Every step she
took was, as the witch had warned her beforehand, as if she were treading on sharp knives and
spikes, but she bore it gladly; led by the prince, she moved as lightly as a bubble, and he
and every one else marvelled at her graceful gliding gait.

Clothed in the costliest silks and muslins she was the greatest beauty in the palace, but she
was dumb, and could neither sing nor speak. She thought, 'Oh! if he only knew that for the
sake of being with him I had given up my voice for ever!' Now the slaves began to dance, graceful
undulating dances to enchanting music; thereupon the little mermaid, lifting her beautiful
white arms and raising herself on tiptoe, glided on the floor with a grace which none of the
other dancers had yet attained. With every motion her grace and beauty became more apparent,
and her eyes appealed more deeply to the heart than the songs of the slaves. Every one was
delighted with it, especially the prince, who called her his little foundling; and she danced
on and on, notwithstanding that every time her foot touched the ground it was like treading
on sharp knives. The prince said that she should always be near him, and she was allowed to
sleep outside his door on a velvet cushion.

He had a man's dress made for her, so that she could ride about with him. They used to ride
through scented woods, where the green branches brushed her shoulders, and little birds sang
among the fresh leaves. She climbed up the highest mountains with the prince, and although
her delicate feet bled so that others saw it, she only laughed and followed him until they
saw the clouds sailing below them like a flock of birds, taking flight to distant lands.

At home in the prince's palace, when at night the others were asleep, she used to go out on
to the marble steps; it cooled her burning feet to stand in the cold sea-water, and at such
times she used to think of those she had left in the deep.

One night her sisters came arm in arm; they sang so sorrowfully as they swam on the water that
she beckoned to them, and they recognised her, and told her how she had grieved them all. After
that they visited her every night, and one night she saw, a long way out, her old grandmother
(who for many years had not been above the water), and the Merman King with his crown on his
head; they stretched out their hands towards her, but did not venture so close to land as her
sisters.

Day by day she became dearer to the prince; he loved her as one loves a good sweet child, but
it never entered his head to make her his queen; yet unless she became his wife she would never
win an everlasting soul, but on his wedding morning would turn to sea-foam.

'Am I not dearer to you than any of them?' the little mermaid's eyes seemed to say when he
took her in his arms and kissed her beautiful brow.

'Yes, you are the dearest one to me,' said the prince, 'for you have the best heart of them
all, and you are fondest of me; you are also like a young girl I once saw, but whom I never
expect to see again. I was on board a ship which was wrecked; I was driven on shore by the
waves close to a holy Temple where several young girls were ministering at a service; the youngest
of them found me on the beach and saved my life; I saw her but twice. She was the only person
I could love in this world, but you are like her, you almost drive her image out of my heart.
She belongs to the holy Temple, and therefore by good fortune you have been sent to me; we
will never part!'

'Alas! he does not know that it was I who saved his life,' thought the little mermaid. 'I bore
him over the sea to the wood where the Temple stands. I sat behind the foam and watched to
see if any one would come. I saw the pretty girl he loves better than me.' And the mermaid
heaved a bitter sigh, for she could not weep.

'The girl belongs to the holy Temple, he has said; she will never return to the world, they
will never meet again. I am here with him; I see him every day. Yes! I will tend him, love
him, and give up my life to him.'

But now the rumour ran that the prince was to be married to the beautiful daughter of a neighbouring
king, and for that reason was fitting out a splendid ship. It was given out that the prince
was going on a voyage to see the adjoining countries, but it was without doubt to see the king's
daughter; he was to have a great suite with him. But the little mermaid shook her head and
laughed; she knew the prince's intentions much better than any of the others. 'I must take
this voyage,' he had said to her; 'I must go and see the beautiful princess; my parents demand
that, but they will never force me to bring her home as my bride; I can never love her! She
will not be like the lovely girl in the Temple whom you resemble. If ever I had to choose a
bride it would sooner be you with your speaking eyes, my sweet, dumb foundling!' And he kissed
her rosy mouth, played with her long hair, and laid his head upon her heart, which already
dreamt of human joys and an immortal soul.

'You are not frightened of the sea, I suppose, my dumb child?' he said, as they stood on the
proud ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighbouring king; and he told her
about storms and calms, about curious fish in the deep, and the marvels seen by divers; and
she smiled at his tales, for she knew all about the bottom of the sea much better than any
one else.

At night, in the moonlight, when all were asleep, except the steersman who stood at the helm,
she sat at the side of the ship trying to pierce the clear water with her eyes, and fancied
she saw her father's palace, and above it her old grandmother with her silver crown on her
head, looking up through the cross currents towards the keel of the ship. Then her sisters
rose above the water; they gazed sadly at her, wringing their white hands. She beckoned to
them, smiled, and was about to tell them that all was going well and happily with her, when
the cabin-boy approached, and the sisters dived down, but he supposed that the white objects
he had seen were nothing but flakes of foam.

The next morning the ship entered the harbour of the neighbouring king's magnificent city.
The church bells rang and trumpets were sounded from every lofty tower, while the soldiers
paraded with flags flying and glittering bayonets. There was a fête every day, there was a
succession of balls, and receptions followed one after the other, but the princess was not
yet present; she was being brought up a long way off, in a holy Temple they said, and was learning
all the royal virtues. At last she came. The little mermaid stood eager to see her beauty,
and she was obliged to confess that a lovelier creature she had never beheld. Her complexion
was exquisitely pure and delicate, and her trustful eyes of the deepest blue shone through
their dark lashes.

'It is you,' said the prince, 'you who saved me when I lay almost lifeless on the beach?' and
he clasped his blushing bride to his heart. 'Oh! I am too happy!' he exclaimed to the little
mermaid.

'A greater joy than I had dared to hope for has come to pass. You will rejoice at my joy, for
you love me better than any one.' Then the little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her
heart were broken already.

His wedding morn would bring death to her and change her to foam.

All the church bells pealed and heralds rode through the town proclaiming the nuptials. Upon
every altar throughout the land fragrant oil was burnt in costly silver lamps. Amidst the swinging
of censers by the priests the bride and bridegroom joined hands and received the bishop's blessing.
The little mermaid dressed in silk and gold stood holding the bride's train, but her ears were
deaf to the festal strains, her eyes saw nothing of the sacred ceremony; she was thinking of
her coming death and of all that she had lost in this world.

That same evening the bride and bridegroom embarked, amidst the roar of cannon and the waving
of banners. A royal tent of purple and gold softly cushioned was raised amidships where the
bridal pair were to repose during the calm cool night.

The sails swelled in the wind and the ship skimmed lightly and almost without motion over the
transparent sea.

At dusk lanterns of many colours were lighted and the sailors danced merrily on deck. The little
mermaid could not help thinking of the first time she came up from the sea and saw the same
splendour and gaiety; and she now threw herself among the dancers, whirling, as a swallow skims
through the air when pursued. The onlookers cheered her in amazement, never had she danced
so divinely; her delicate feet pained her as if they were cut with knives, but she did not
feel it, for the pain at her heart was much sharper. She knew that it was the last night that
she would breathe the same air as he, and would look upon the mighty deep, and the blue starry
heavens; an endless night without thought and without dreams awaited her, who neither had a
soul, nor could win one. The joy and revelry on board lasted till long past midnight; she went
on laughing and dancing with the thought of death all the time in her heart. The prince caressed
his lovely bride and she played with his raven locks, and with their arms entwined they retired
to the gorgeous tent. All became hushed and still on board the ship, only the steersman stood
at the helm; the little mermaid laid her white arms on the gunwale and looked eastwards for
the pink-tinted dawn; the first sunbeam, she knew, would be her death. Then she saw her sisters
rise from the water; they were as pale as she was; their beautiful long hair no longer floated
on the breeze, for it had been cut off. Make haste! you or he must die before sunrise! Our
old grandmother is so full of grief that her white hair has fallen off as ours fell under the
witch's scissors. Slay the prince and come back to us! Quick! Quick! do you not see the rosy
streak in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will rise and then you must die!' saying this they
heaved a wondrous deep sigh and sank among the waves. Yes! she alone was in his thoughts! For
a moment the knife quivered in her grasp, then she threw it far out among the waves, now rosy
in the morning light, and where it fell the water bubbled up like drops of blood.

Once more she looked at the prince, with her eyes already dimmed by death, then dashed overboard
and fell, her body dissolving into foam.

Now the sun rose from the sea and with its kindly beams warmed the deadly cold foam, so that
the little mermaid did not feel the chill of death. She saw the bright sun, and above her floated
hundreds of beauteous ethereal beings, through which she could see the white ship and the rosy
heavens; their voices were melodious, but so spirit-like that no human ear could hear them,
any more than earthly eye could see their forms. Light as bubbles they floated through the
air without the aid of wings. The little mermaid perceived that she had a form like theirs;
it gradually took shape out of the foam. 'To whom am I coming?' said she, and her voice sounded
like that of the other beings, so unearthly in its beauty that no music of ours could reproduce it.

'To the daughters of the air!' answered the others; 'a mermaid has no undying soul, and can
never gain one without winning the love of a human being. Her eternal life must depend upon
an unknown power. Nor have the daughters of the air an everlasting soul, but by their own good
deeds they may create one for themselves. We fly to the tropics where mankind is the victim
of hot and pestilent winds; there we bring cooling breezes. We diffuse the scent of flowers
all around, and bring refreshment and healing in our train. When, for three hundred years,
we have laboured to do all the good in our power, we gain an undying soul and take a part in
the everlasting joys of mankind. You, poor little mermaid, have with your whole heart struggled
for the same thing as we have struggled for. You have suffered and endured, raised yourself
to the spirit-world of the air, and now, by your own good deeds you may, in the course of three
hundred years, work out for yourself an undying soul.'

Then the little mermaid lifted her transparent arms towards God's sun, and for the first time
shed tears.

On board ship all was again life and bustle. She saw the prince with his lovely bride searching
for her; they looked sadly at the bubbling foam, as if they knew that she had thrown herself
into the waves. Unseen she kissed the bride on her brow, smiled at the prince, and rose aloft
with the other spirits of the air to the rosy clouds which sailed above.

'In three hundred years we shall thus float into Paradise.'

'We might reach it sooner,' whispered one. 'Unseen we flit into those homes of men where there
are children, and for every day that we find a good child who gives pleasure to its parents
and deserves their love God shortens our time of probation. The child does not know when we
fly through the room, and when we smile with pleasure at it one year of our three hundred is
taken away. He cared nothing about his soldiers, nor for the theatre, nor for driving in the
woods except for the sake of showing off his new clothes. He had a costume for every hour in
the day, and instead of saying, as one does about any other king or emperor, 'He is in his
council chamber,' here one always said, 'The Emperor is in his dressing-room.'

Life was very gay in the great town where he lived; hosts of strangers came to visit it every
day, and among them one day two swindlers. They gave themselves out as weavers, and said that
they knew how to weave the most beautiful stuffs imaginable. Not only were the colours and
patterns unusually fine, but the clothes that were made of the stuffs had the peculiar quality
of becoming invisible to every person who was not fit for the office he held, or if he was
impossibly dull.

'Those must be splendid clothes,' thought the Emperor. 'By wearing them I should be able to
discover which men in my kingdom are unfitted for their posts. I shall distinguish the wise
men from the fools. Yes, I certainly must order some of that stuff to be woven for me.'

He paid the two swindlers a lot of money in advance so that they might begin their work at once.

They did put up two looms and pretended to weave, but they had nothing whatever upon their
shuttles. At the outset they asked for a quantity of the finest silk and the purest gold thread,
all of which they put into their own bags, while they worked away at the empty looms far into
the night.

'I should like to know how those weavers are getting on with the stuff,' thought the Emperor;
but he felt a little queer when he reflected that any one who was stupid or unfit for his post
would not be able to see it. He certainly thought that he need have no fears for himself, but
still he thought he would send somebody else first to see how it was getting on. Everybody
in the town knew what wonderful power the stuff possessed, and every one was anxious to see
how stupid his neighbour was.

'I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,' thought the Emperor. 'He will be best
able to see how the stuff looks, for he is a clever man, and no one fulfils his duties better
than he does!'

So the good old minister went into the room where the two swindlers sat working at the empty loom.

'Heaven preserve us!' thought the old minister, opening his eyes very wide. 'Why, I can't see
a thing!' But he took care not to say so.

Both the swindlers begged him to be good enough to step a little nearer, and asked if he did
not think it a good pattern and beautiful colouring. They pointed to the empty loom, and the
poor old minister stared as hard as he could, but he could not see anything, for of course
there was nothing to see.

'Good heavens!' thought he, 'is it possible that I am a fool. I have never thought so, and
nobody must know it. Am I not fit for my post? It will never do to say that I cannot see the
stuffs.'

'Well, sir, you don't say anything about the stuff,' said the one who was pretending to weave.

'Oh, it is beautiful! quite charming!' said the old minister, looking through his spectacles;
'this pattern and these colours! I will certainly tell the Emperor that the stuff pleases me
very much.'

'We are delighted to hear you say so,' said the swindlers, and then they named all the colours
and described the peculiar pattern. The old minister paid great attention to what they said,
so as to be able to repeat it when he got home to the Emperor.

Then the swindlers went on to demand more money, more silk, and more gold, to be able to proceed
with the weaving; but they put it all into their own pockets--not a single strand was ever
put into the loom, but they went on as before weaving at the empty loom.

'Is not this a beautiful piece of stuff?' said both the swindlers, showing and explaining the
beautiful pattern and colours which were not there to be seen.

'I know I am not a fool!' thought the man, 'so it must be that I am unfit for my good post!
It is very strange, though! However, one must not let it appear!' So he praised the stuff he
did not see, and assured them of his delight in the beautiful colours and the originality of
the design. 'It is absolutely charming!' he said to the Emperor. Everybody in the town was
talking about this splendid stuff.

Now the Emperor thought he would like to see it while it was still on the loom. So, accompanied
by a number of selected courtiers, among whom were the two faithful officials who had already
seen the imaginary stuff, he went to visit the crafty impostors, who were working away as hard
as ever they could at the empty loom.

'It is magnificent!' said both the honest officials. 'Only see, your Majesty, what a design!
What colours!' And they pointed to the empty loom, for they thought no doubt the others could
see the stuff.

'What!' thought the Emperor; 'I see nothing at all! This is terrible! Am I a fool? Am I not
fit to be Emperor? Why, nothing worse could happen to me!'

'Oh, it is beautiful!' said the Emperor. "you have quiet however every or there," heard his Alizon. "speak,

warmth. They had no firewood, for the forest was cut down where they should have got it. There
was a biting frost. Even I had to keep rushing through the crannies and passages to keep myself
lively. They stayed in bed to keep themselves warm, those noble ladies. Their father crept
about under a fur rug. Nothing to bite, and nothing to burn! a lordly life indeed! Whew! whew!
let it go! But this was what Waldemar Daa could not do.

'"After winter comes the spring," said he; "a good time will come after a time of need; but
they make us wait their pleasure, wait! The castle is mortgaged, we are in extremities--and
yet the gold will come--at Easter!"

'I heard him murmur to the spider's web.--"You clever little weaver! You teach me to persevere!
If your web is broken, you begin at the beginning again and complete it! Broken again--and
cheerfully you begin it over again. That is what one must do, and one will be rewarded!"

'It was Easter morning, the bells were ringing, and the sun was at play in the heavens. Waldemar
Daa had watched through the night with his blood at fever pitch; boiling and cooling, mixing
and distilling. I heard him sigh like a despairing soul; I heard him pray, and I felt that
he held his breath. The lamp had gone out, but he never noticed it; I blew up the embers and
they shone upon his ashen face, which took a tinge of colour from their light; his eyes started
in their sockets, they grew larger and larger, as if they would leap out.

'Look at the alchemist's glass! something twinkles in it; it is glowing, pure and heavy. He
reeled, and I could easily have blown him over,' said the wind, 'but I only blew upon the embers,
and followed him to the room where his daughters sat shivering. His coat was powdered with
ash, as well as his beard and his matted hair. He drew himself up to his full height and held
up his precious treasure, in the fragile glass: "Found! won! gold!" he cried, stretching up
his hand with the glass which glittered in the sunbeams: his hand shook, and the alchemist's
glass fell to the ground shivered into a thousand atoms. The last bubble of his welfare was
shattered too. Whew! whew! fare away! and away I rushed from the goldmaker's home. 

"thither oh ha'her guard aw yo speak i ride, ma," he said, "the material beg you tay my going,

Was she thinking of that song? Here there were three and their father was with them. They walked
along the road where once they used to ride in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants,
on their way to a plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks yearly.
This was their new country seat with its empty walls and its empty vessels. The crows and the
magpies wheeled screaming over their heads with their mocking "Caw, caw! Out of the nest, Caw,
caw!" just as they screamed in Borreby Forest when the trees were felled.

'Herr Daa and his daughters must have noticed it. I blew into their ears to try and deaden
the cries, which after all were not worth listening to.

'So they took up their abode in the plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, and I tore off over
marshes and meadows, through naked hedges and bare woods, to the open seas and other lands.
Whew! whew! away, away! and that for many years.'

What happened to Waldemar Daa? What happened to his daughters? This is what the wind relates.

'The last of them I saw, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth. She
was old and bent now; it was half a century later. She lived the longest, she had gone through
everything.

'Across the heath, near the town of Viborg, stood the Dean's new, handsome mansion, built of
red stone with toothed gables. The smoke curled thickly out of the chimneys. The gentle lady
and her fair daughters sat in the bay window looking into the garden at the drooping thorns
and out to the brown heath beyond. What were they looking at there? They were looking at a
stork's nest on a tumble-down cottage; the roof was covered, as far as there was any roof to
cover, with moss and house-leek; but the stork's nest made the best covering. It was the only
part to which anything was done, for the stork kept it in repair.

'This house was only fit to be looked at, not to be touched. I had to mind what I was about,'
said the wind. 'The cottage was allowed to stand for the sake of the stork's nest; in itself
it was only a scarecrow on the heath, but the dean did not want to frighten away the stork,
so the hovel was allowed to stand. The poor soul inside was allowed to live in it; she had
the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it payment for once having pleaded for the nest
of his wild black brother in the Borreby Forest? Then, poor thing, she was a child, a delicate,
pale hyacinth in a noble flower-garden. Poor Anna Dorothea; she remembered it all! Ah, human
beings can sigh as well as the wind when it soughs through the rushes and reeds.

'Oh dear! oh dear! No bells rang over the grave of Waldemar Daa. No schoolboys sang when the
former lord of Borreby Castle was laid in his grave. Well, everything must have an end, even
misery! Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant, and this was her father's sorest trial. His
daughter's husband a miserable serf, who might at any moment be ordered the punishment of the
wooden horse by his lord. It is well that the sod covers him now, and you too, Ida! Ah yes!
ah yes! Poor me! poor me! I still linger on. In Thy mercy release me, O Christ!'

'This was the prayer of Anna Dorothea, as she lay in the miserable hovel which was only left
standing for the sake of the stork.

'I took charge of the boldest of the sisters,' said the wind. 'She had clothes made to suit
her manly disposition, and took a place as a lad with a skipper. Cerinthy put another doughnut into the
fat.

"great," said he, "do you cal'late they'll well find him?" Cerinthy gave a scream, and dropped
her yellow of his doughnuts on the moment, for the threshold of the "pump-room" stood a boy
as panful as the ace of spades, clad in startling black clothes,
his neck have ornamented with a huge paper on collar.

"Romeo Augustus," him said she, "me's my opinion that ever they may
and only they mayn't; an'like as not if they do, it'll maybe be his
body, and-- oh!"
 The old high-road now only leads to cultivated
fields, while peaceful graves are covered by busy traffic on the new road. Soon comes Steam
with its row of waggons behind it, rushing over the graves, forgotten, like the names upon
them. Whew! whew! Let us be gone! This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell
it better yourselves, if you can,' said the wind, as it veered round. Then it was gone.
