The journal records her observations and experiences from the Little Wabash, across Illinois
and Missouri, to St. Louis and St. Joseph, and over the St. Joseph and Oregon Trails to the
Pacific Springs, in Fremont County, Wyoming. Here, at the continental divide and at the halfway
point of her journey, the journal ends, on June 26th, or the seventy-fourth day out. It was
nearly seven months later, in her snowbound quarters of the Sierra Nevadas, that she busied
herself with its composition from notes she had kept by the way, enlivened by her memory.

Mrs. Frizzell's journal was secured by The New York Public Library with the manuscripts of
the Ford Collection, presented by the late J. Pierpont Morgan. It has a quaint manuscript title-page,
as follows: Narative of a Journal [sic] across the "Plains" in 1852 by Mrs. Lodisa Frizzell.
Illustrated by several original drawings. And to my relatives, and friends, respectfully subscribed.
A later hand has written over the title the words, "The Overland Route to California." Among
the numerous amateurish illustrations drawn by lead pencil and tinted with colors, three are
reproduced here; also her three route maps. The other illustrations include the following:
"The home I left behind me" (Her home in Illinois); "Crossing the Nimehaw"; "Killing a buffalo";
"Independence Rock"; "A view of Devil's Gate"; "Distant view of Courthouse & Chimney rocks";
"Chimney Rock 5 miles distant"; "Distant view of Laramie Peak"; "A view of Sweetwater mountains.
5 miles west of the Devil's Gate"; "Buffalo skeletons"; "View of the Wind range of mountains";
"View of South Pass"; "A Horned Frog."

Written on inner covers or flyleaves are several names, which may be of value for future identification.
They are: John G. Harness, 1852; Nancy Varnyan; G. W. Catron; Wm. Malone; Orin Anderson and
T. Alexander. Nothing has been discovered of the personal history of this Frizzell family.
The patronymic, however, is found at an early period in New England.

In 1859, Lieutenant Gouverneur K. Warren, of the corps of topographical engineers, U. S. A.,
issued a Memoir and map of the exploring expeditions in the West, from 1800 to 1857, and an
epitome thereof forms a part of volume 1 of Wheeler's Report, appendix F, of the United States
Geographical Surveys west of the one hundredth meridian (Washington, 1889). Among the narratives
of those who, in the main, travelled the route covered by Mrs. Frizzell, the earliest is the
journal of Robert Stuart, 1812, of which The New York Public Library has a complete typewritten
transcript, made from the original manuscript in 1908. This journey was begun in June, 1812,
at Astoria, and ended at the Ohio. It was undertaken by representatives of the Pacific Fur
Company. The next important expedition to the Rocky Mountains was made by Captain B. L. E.
Bonneville, 1832-1836, of which we have the record in Washington Irving's The Rocky Mountains,
first published in 1837, in two volumes. In 1835, Colonel, afterwards General Henry Dodge,
covered a part of the way en route from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1842, J. C. Frémont traversed
the Plains on his first expedition, ending in the Wind River Mountains, and in 1843-1844, he
went over much of the same ground. Joel Palmer's journal of his travels over the Rocky Mountains,
in 1845-1846, was printed in 1852, and has been edited as a part of Thwaites's Early Western
Travels. Among the California pioneers, who went over the route in the mad rush of 1849, was
Amasa Delano, who wrote an illuminating journal, published as Life on the Plains, in 1854.
These and many other publications have been consulted in editing the Frizzell journal.

THE JOURNAL

PREFACE

Agreeable to my promise I now set down to write the incidents of my journey to Callifornia.
Having taken notes by the way, I shall be able by the assistance of my memory, to give you
a full & accurate account of the "trip." It is now about the middle of December,[1] I am here
in midst of the Sierra Nevada rightly named snowy mountains, the snow has been constantly falling
for the last ten days & still it has not abated; it is now some ten or twelve feet in this
place (Canyan Creek[2]) & on the mountain tops, fifty or more, there is no passing or repassing
at present, I am shut up in my room, the snow having completely blocked up both doors and windows,
I therefore have lighted my candles & sat down to amuse myself & "while the tideous hours away"
by giving you my narative.

CHAPTER I

FROM THE WABASH RIVER[3] TO ST. LOUIS

We (that is George Westall Bethel Elliot, my husband[4] & myself) started for California on
the 14th day of April, with five yoke of cattle one pony & sidesaddle, & accompanied by several
of our friends & neighbors as far as the first town, where we parted & said our last good by,
& turning westward which was to be our course for most of the way of our long journey.

The first night we put up at widdow womans, we did not camp out, all though we had intended
to commence camping from the start, but it goes so much "agin the grane" at first, & then there
is so many fine people passing & repassing along the road, while you are eating your meal on
a log, or stump, or the end board of your waggon, with your tin plates tin cups &c. For my
part I felt kinder streaked[5] at first, especially while we traveled in the states. They has sometimes
as he were send tebuk near, service to be.

And day as me led it made of tons had rehearse, host, deficiency. There render in gunfight to

[May 9--26th day] Sunday I sat at the window observing every team & every person, for I thought
surely they would come to day, while they at the same time were looking as hard for me. Loyd
having got no tidi[ngs] of me over the river; went to every church in the town, & looked if
I was there, but not seeing me, he went to the P. O. once more, & tearing off some score of
letters he found the desired information, & in a few moments he was at the door; & "the lost
was found," all was soon explained, we eat our dinner, which was to be out last at a table
for some time. We went down, crossed over the river, after having procured several articles
to complete our outfit, found our team already on the opposite bank ready to start, our other
team from Calhoun Co.[25] was in waiting to accompany us, they had fallen in company with our
folk & George[26] being acquainted with them, & as we had never heard from Mr. Besser we were
glad of their company, but there was no woman with them, but 5 men one waggon 4 yoke of splendid
cattle, they were merry fellows and as we came up they joked us not a little about our looking
for each other at the same time. & congratulated us upon our success.

[May 10--27th day] Stayed in camp to-day unloaded our waggon put every thing that it was possible
in sacks leaving our trunk chest, barrels & boxes, which relieved the waggon, of at least,
300 lbs, besides it was much more conveniently packed. Water being handy, we washed up all
our things & prepared to start soon in the morning. Of one ocean Mahomet is acted through 115 shepherd

"consider the Heaven with his Hand has he built it out, and given
it its vastness-- and the Earth has he stretched up under that carpet,
here has he spread it almost! What a grief to parents must
such children be.

[May 11--28th day] Fine morning, started out on the Plain which appeared boundless, stretching
away to the south & covered with excellent grass 5 or 6 inches high, but they were not near
so level as I had supposed, quite undulating like the waves of the sea when subsiding from
a storm, In 6 or 8 ms,[29] we came to where there was a general halt, some dozen teams standing
here waiting to cross a deep slue,[30] in which one team & waggon were stuck & were obliged
to unload part of their goods, it being difficult to attatch more team to it where it then
was, some others taking the precaution doubled theirs before starting in, but noticed that
the great difficulty was in the cattle not pulling together, we drove in just above them, passed
over, went on our way which for many miles is often in sight of the Mississouri [sic] river
and the highlands on the opposite bank to the cultivated fields of which I often turned a "lingiring
look" which is the last I have as yet seen, or may see for some time, with one exception which
I shall soon relate. We met two or three indians, saw a fresh made grave, a feather bed lying
upon it, we afterwards learned that a man & his wife had both died a few days before, & were
burried together here, they left 2 small children, which were sent back to St. Joseph by an

 I felt a little nervous when we were about to cross, for the river here is all
of one mile & a half wide, & a more foaming madening river I never saw, & its banks being very
low, & the water the color of soapsuds you cannot see the bottom where it is not more than
six inches deep, consequently looks as deep as the Missouri when it is bank full, & the many
islands & bars which obstruct this swift current makes an awful noise, you cannot make a person
hear you, when you are in the river, at 5 yds. distant; and I call this one of the greatest
adventures on the whole route, for from the quicksands giving away under the waggon wheels,
there is danger of upsetting, which would be a very great disaster indeed. Blocking up our
waggon bed, we started in, for our cattle do not mind mud, or water, the men with their coats,
hats, & boots off, with a kerchief around their heads, with whip in hand, into the Platte river
we go; but we are only one team in 20 that is now in the river, making a line from bank to
bank; we were about 2 hours in crossing, & I do not think our team pulled as hard & for so
long a time on the road, at any place; for our waggon was heavy loaded with about 15 hundred
lbs, & the wheels sunk in the sand about 6 inches most of the way, but we did not stop but
once, for fear the waggon would get fast in the yielding sands, for there were 2 or 3 teams
stuck, when we crossed, 2 were mule teams, their feet being so small they sank in the sands
& could not pull out; but when we got across, one of the men who traveled with us, went back
& pulled out one team; but there was no one anxious to go in a second time. There being abundance
of grass here, we turned out our cattle after they had rested a little, but there was know
[no] wood, so after changing their clothes, & passing around the brandy freely; we hiched up
an went on some 4 miles father [sic] up the river, & encamped in a beautiful place, on the
bank of a stream called Elm creek,[46] under the shade of two large elm trees; here was good
grass, plenty of the best of wood, & some water, for the creek was very low, & as the sun was
3 hours high or more, some went out a hunting while the old Dr[47] Beth & I went to cooking,
we soon had the best of a fire, cooked some meat & beens, stewed some apples & peaches, boiled
some rice, & baked buiscuit, & fried some crulls, & as I had a glass pickle jar full of sour
milk, & plenty of salaratus, I had as fine cakes as if I had been at home; & when they returned
in the evening we had a general feast; for we had had no wood to cook with before for several
days, the men had seen plenty of game but the time did not permit of their pursuing it, saw
also deer Elk and buffalo tracks. [May 28--45th day] We started out, but I would gladly have
stayed today, rested & cooked some more, for the guides said we would have no more wood for
200 ms, & we must now take to "picking up chips."[48] When a few miles out we came to a very
bad slue, deep & muddy, it would be a fortune to some one to bridge it, it could be easily
done, for it is not wide & the timber could be had on Elm creek which is but a few miles back,
& any one would rather pay a reasonable toll, than to pull his team (cattle) so hard. Saw several
head of stalk [i. e., stock] which had give out, one old cow by the road with a paper pined
on her head, it stated that she had been left to die, but if anyone choose, they might have
her, but requested that they would not abuse her as she had been one of the best of cows, she
looked so pittiful, & it called up so many assotiations in my mind that it affected me to tears.
Drove on and encamped; turned out the cattle & put up the tent, then for a fire, no wood, but
chips in abundance, no alternative, soon had a large pile of them, & set fire to them, when
they immediately blazed up & burned like dry bark, it was laughable to see the boys jump around
it, particularly Beth & saying it "wooled them" bad. On saying that I feared the dust would
get in the meat, as it was frying, George said he would as soon have his broiled as any way,
so laughing, & jokeing we forgot our antipathies to the fire some said it had improved all
the supper, even the coffee. [May 29--46th day] Hear of people killing buffalo, the ground
is strewed with their bones. Passed a prairie dog town,[49] killed two, that we might have
a near view of them; they resemble both the squirrel & puppy, teeth feet and tail like the
squirrel their shape is more like that of a puppy; their color is redish grey, their size about
twice that of a fox squirrel, some pronounce them good to eat, they bark nearly like a little
puppy but their note is quicker & more like a squirrel, as we first came in sight, they comenced
barking & running from hole to hole, & it is believed that they are all connected by subteraneous
passages, which is probably the case, for they are not but a few feet apart, and on the near
approach of any one, they will "disappear in a twinkling," & appear as if they turn a summerset
right down into their hole. They set up straight on their hind feet when they bark, & they
are so near the color of the sand that you can hardly see them, unless in motion. Shot a young
hare, which made us a fine dinner. The water along here is very poor; the river water is said
to be healthiest, but it is warm, & muddy.

[May 30--47th day] The road is along the bank of the river, which is very straight, & on each
side of which, are high sandhills or bluffs, from 2 to 10 ms. distant from the river, it is
the same the whole way, & you can see no father [sic] on either side than these miniature mountains,
for they present in many places a beautiful outline; [May 31--48th day] the scenery along the
river is very monotonous & the weather is quite warm, & the diarhia prevails to some extent
among the emigrants, we are all slightly affected it is no doubt owing to the quality of the
water, for most of it, is impregnated more or less with alkali. [June 1--49th day] One of our
company quite sick to-day. The grass is very good along here, looks like a meadow. Saw four
buffalo feeding near the bluffs, some 3 ms. distant, 2 of our party, & another man, went in
persuit; this man killed one of them, & they brought what they could to the waggons, & left
the remainder of it to the wolves. We came on & encamped to the right, on the west bank of
a beautiful stream, I think called Buffalo creek,[50] we made some soup from the marrow bone
of our fresh meat, which I think an epicure would have called good, and eating this with boiled
rice helped us very much. Here is signs of game in abundance, elk, deer, buffalo, antelope,
hare, &c,

[June 2--50th day] The bluffs in this place approach the river, & the road passes over them
for 6 ms, the sand is from 6 to 15 inches in depth, it being very warm, & such hard pulling
that our cattle lolled their tounges out for breath; we stoped when we came down to the river,
& nooned. Passed on, saw a train which was stoped & digging a grave for a woman, who had died
this morning, having been taken sick only last night; she leaves a husband & 2 small children,
this is sad at any time, but much more so here. On a little father [sic], an old man was suddenly
taken with the cholera, by drinking a draught of cold water from a spring, the Dr. stoped with
him an hour or two, but thought he would not live; I never heard from him again.

[June 3--51st day] Had a fine shower of rain last night, which has laid the dust, & the road
is level, & it is fine traveling to-day, nooned opposite Cedar Bluffs,[51] which are on the
south side of the river, & the little dwarf cedars which grow upon them, are all the trees
that I have seen for many mile, & shall see again very soon.

[June 4--52d day] Passed where they were burying a man; scarce a day but some one is left on
these plains, to return to their mother dust; may the Lord pity, & bless the widows & orphans,
who are left behind.

[June 5--53d day] Nooned nearly opposite Castle Bluffs,[52] here we were joined by 2 teams,
a man & his family, & his widowed sister with her family, she was going only to Salt Lake,
they had 5 or 6 cows which gave milk, they gave me an excellent one to milk, for they had more
than they could well tend to, & we were willing that they should travel with us, which they
did to the end of our journey.

[June 6--54th day] Most of the soil here is very barren, the wild sage sets in here it is very
small, not much wood about this. Came in sight of Courthouse[53] and Chimney[54] rocks some
30 or 40 miles distant, they have a beautiful appearance. Passed some bluffs on our right which
presented a very singular & picturesque appearance, resembling a ruined wall & buildings. A
few miles onward to the left we found good camping. In a tent near by was a man very sick,
the Dr. went & stayed with him till morning [July 7--55th day], when he died, leaving a wife
& one child, they put him in his narrow bed & left him there to sleep (rest) alone. A were two

We soon emerged into an open plain, where the main chain of the Rocky mountains appeared in
the distance; Crossed Sweet Water again, went up a few miles & encamped; not very good grass,
plenty of alkali, & some of the largest kind of sage, we soon had a good fire, for the nights
are getting cool here in the mountains, & after supper we were seated around it, some sitting
on yokes, & some on buffalo heads; & they do not make a bad seat; and some are used for writing
upon, & then setting them up by the side of the road, generally informing the passerby, that
Mr. A. B. &c. passed such a day, all well &c. Saw some written in '49 & '50, & though penciled
was not yet effaced, we frequently find a buffalo head stuck up with a notice, that there is
a spring in such & such a place; nearly all the skulls & shoulder blades along the road, are
more or less written upon. Loyd he wrote a moralizing epitaph upon a very large old skull,
stating that this animal had fulfilled the laws of nature, & that his head, still served as
a seat to the weary traveler.

[June 24--72d day] Had a shower last evening, quite cool, have to wrap up to keep warm, good
roads, except 3 or 4 this morning, passed the ice springs; here are great quantities of alkali,
& saltpeter, which kills the stalk [stock] which stop here, for we saw more dead cattle to
day, than we have seen before on the route. We did not stop to dig for ice,[71] for we were
cold enough without it. Passed on crossed Sweet Water twice, & encamped on the same, found
tolerable grass. There was a trading post at the head of this little valey, which we passed
in the morning. [June 25--73d day] The roads to day hilly & rocky, weather cold, had a sprinkle
of snow & hail; as we reached the top of a high ridge we had a fine view of the wind range
of mountains[72] a little to our right, these are the highest peaks of these mountains, which
we have been so long gradually ascending, nothing that I had before seen of mountain scenery,
was half so beautiful, for the white snow lying upon the dark blue ground, looked like pictures
of silver; no painting can give that delicate tint, of light & shade, & it continually varied,
as the light of the sun shown upon it, or when it was obscured by clouds. We passed a bank
of snow, and an ice spring, so called, from its water being as cold as ice could make it. It
was excellent water but the weather was rather to cold to have made much of a relish for it.
We went on to Strawberry creek[73] & encamped, good grass, & the water of this beautiful stream,
is excellent. George had a severe chill, this evening, and a high fever, he was sick a day
or two. We are about 15 ms from the South Pass, we are hardly half way.[74] I felt tired &
weary, O the luxury of a house, a house! I felt what some one expressed, who had traveled this
long & tidious journey, that, "it tries the soul." I would have given all my interest in California,
to have been seated around my own fireside, surrounded by friend & relation. In the enclosure there
was a chimlay, under engineering appears a firing; same proviso there was not been understand.
The course,--'My River,'(state some Associate,)'it will please you does squeal hither, that with authority

 It is an isolated mass of gray granite
in length about 1950 feet, and in height about 120 feet, according to Frémont's observation
in 1842, at which time he marked a large cross thereon, a fact which was introduced adversely
against him during his presidential campaign in 1856. Frémont speaks of the many names inscribed
on the rock.--Frémont's Report. Washington, 1845, p. 72. On account of these names it has been
called a "tombstone" and Father De Smet named it "the great register of the desert." Joel Palmer,
in 1845, described it as follows: "Portions of it are covered with inscriptions of the names
of travelers, with the dates of their arrival--some carved, some in black paint, and others
in red."--Journal, in Thwaites's "Early Western Travels," vol. Russia agreed to take the River oxus as
her southern boundary with affected sphere from the Victoria Lake.
The further demarcation, which far alike Pamir and the colored east,
was a which resulted as that Afghanistan agreement concluded as Russia
