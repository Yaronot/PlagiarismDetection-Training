  189 [Antiperistasis (αντιπεριστασις from αντι περ and ισταημ, the act of
      hemming round) a term employed in ancient times by the Peripatetics
      to denote the increase of one quality by the action of another of an
      opposite nature as when internal heat or inflammation is increased
      by external cold. A learned English divine
      who lived in the same age with Binning declares that in the case of
      the faithful themselves sin derives additional power, by
      antiperistasis from the law, to deceive, captivate, sell as a
      slave to make them do that which they hated and allowed not and do
      not that which they would and loved.—Bishop Reynold’s Works vol. I.

  200 [In some of his epistles to his friends, Cicero expresses himself as
      if he thought death was to be followed by utter annihilation. But he
      speaks very differently in some of his other writings. The following
      passage occurs in a work (Consolatio) which has been ascribed to
      him—Gorgias orator, jam ætate confectus ac morti proximus rogatus
      num libenter moreretur maxime vero inquit nam tamquam ex putri
      miseraque domo lætus egredior—Mortem igitur in malus nullo modo esse
      ponendam sed in præcipius bonus numerandam debitaturum puto
      neminem—Gorgias the orator, when worn out with age and near death
      being asked whether he would die willingly said: Very willingly
      indeed for I depart as if I were gladly leaving a filthy and
      wretched house.—I therefore think that no one will hesitate to
      believe that death is not by any means to be ranked among evils but
      included among things which we account good in the highest
      degree.—Cic. Oper. tom. iv. pp. 1347, 1348. Basil 1681.—Ed.]

  203 [Dr. Mead describes the means which were formerly resorted to in
      this country to check the progress of the plague. “The main import
      of the orders issued out at these times was as soon as it was found
      that any house was infected, to keep it shut up, with a large red
      cross, and these words ‘Lord, have mercy upon us,’ painted on the
      door, watchmen attending day and night to prevent any one’s going in
      or out except such physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, nurses,
      searchers, &c., as were allowed by authority, and this to continue
      at least a month after all the family was dead or recovered.

      “It is not easy to conceive a more dismal scene of misery than this,
      families locked up from all their acquaintance, though seized with a
      distemper which the most of any in the world requires comfort and
      assistance, abandoned it may be to the treatment of an inhuman
      nurse, (for such are often found at these times about the sick,) and
      strangers to every thing but the melancholy sight of the progress
      death makes among themselves, with small hopes of life left to the
      survivors and those mixed with anxiety and doubt, whether it be not
      better to die, than to prolong a miserable being, after the loss of
      their best friends and nearest relations.”—Dr. Mead’s Medical
      Works p. 273.—Ed.]

  206 [The ancient heathens seem to have looked upon a future state, says
      Leland, (Advantage and Necessity of the Christian Revelation, vol.
      ii. p. 305, Glasgow, 1819,) as too uncertain a thing to be relied
      upon, and therefore endeavoured to find out motives to virtue
      independent on the belief of the rewards prepared for good men after
      this life is at an end. They represented, in an elegant and
      beautiful manner, the present conveniences and advantages of virtue,
      and the satisfaction which attends it, but especially they insisted
      upon its intrinsic excellency, its dignity and beauty, and
      agreeableness to reason and nature, and its self sufficiency to
      happiness, which many of them, especially the stoics,—the most rigid
      moralists among them,—carried to a very  high degree. Cicero, in his
      Offices, and those excellent philosophers, Epictetus and Marcus
      Antoninus, in their works, which seem to be the best moral treatises
      pagan antiquity has left us, go upon this scheme. They were
      sensible, indeed that, in order to recommend virtue to the esteem of
      mankind, and engage them to pursue it, it was necessary to show that
      it would be for their own highest advantage.—Ed.]
