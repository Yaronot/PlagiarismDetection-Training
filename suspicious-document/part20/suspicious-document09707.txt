In the meantime Charles had concluded a separate treaty with the Dutch (19 Feb., 1674), who
continued to struggle manfully against the French king, with such assistance as they derived
from the emperor and the German states. The Commons were fearful of entrusting the king with
either money or troops lest he should employ them against the Dutch, or against their own liberties.
The successes of Louis at length provoked a general cry for war against France, and the Commons
went so far as to pass a bill (8 March, 1678) imposing a poll tax as part of the supply.(1418)
Charles lost no time in applying to the City for the sum of £100,000 on the security of this
tax, and the court of Common Council signified its readiness to advance the money (9 April).(1419)
Finding that parliament hesitated to furnish the supplies it had voted, and without which he
assured the members he would have to lay up the fleet and disband some of the newly raised
forces, Charles applied to the City for another £50,000. This, too, was granted (14 May);(1420)
and Charles, in order to show his displeasure with the Commons, resorted to his usual tactics
and prorogued parliament, but only for ten days.(1421) A few days after the Commons had again
met they resolved (27 May) that if the king would declare war against France they would give
him their hearty support, otherwise they would at once proceed to take into consideration the
speedy disbandment of the army.(1422) The king refusing to declare war, parliament proceeded
(4 June) to carry out its threat and voted the sum of £200,000 for the disbandment of all the
forces that had been raised since the 29th September, 1677.(1423) The disbandment did not take
place, however, but in its stead a force was despatched to Holland. Scarcely had it arrived
before the peace of Nimeguen was signed.

(M723)

Just when the war was brought so unexpectedly to an end Charles signified his desire for another
loan by the City to the extent of £200,000. The matter was brought to the notice of the Common
Council on the last day of July, and on the 1st August the lord mayor issued his precept to
the aldermen of the several wards to invite subscriptions.(1424) For what purpose the money
was required we are not told. It was generally feared that the king meditated a suppression
of the liberties of his subjects by the introduction of foreign troops. This fear was enhanced
by the knowledge that if Charles died the crown would fall to his brother, an uncompromising
Catholic. The public mind became so unhinged that every breath or rumour created the greatest
trepidation. Within a fortnight after the City had signified its assent to the last loan the
nation was suddenly surprised by some words let drop by Dr. Tonge, the weak and credulous rector
of St. Michael’s, Wood Street, and the tool of the infamous Titus Oates. A Popish plot was,
he said, on foot and the king’s life in danger, in proof of which he produced documentary evidence.
Oates, the prime mover in starting the idea of a plot, was ready in the most shameless way
with depositions to corroborate all that Tonge had said. These depositions he made before a
Middlesex magistrate, Sir Edmondesbury Godfrey. The next morning Godfrey’s corpse was found
lying in a ditch near Primrose Hill. All London was wild with excitement and jumped to the
conclusion that the Middlesex Justice had met a violent death for listening to Oates’s evidence,
although there is reason for believing him to have fallen by his own hands. The cry against
Papists continued unabated for years.(1425) The city presented the appearance of a state of
siege with its gates kept closed, its streets protected with posts and chains, and an armed
watch kept by night and day.(1426) In October, when according to custom the king was to be
invited to the lord mayor’s banquet, the Recorder was instructed to congratulate his majesty
upon his recent escape and to make arrangements for a deputation to wait upon him in person.(1427)

(M724)

When parliament met on the 21st of this month it passed a new Test Act rigidly excluding all
Catholics from both Houses. Five Catholic peers were committed to the Tower, and Coleman, the
secretary of the Duchess of York, was tried and executed for having in his possession papers
betraying a design for forcing the Roman Catholic religion on the nation. It next proceeded
to impeach Danby for having been concerned in certain money transactions between Charles and
the king of France. Knowing the danger likely to arise from such an investigation, Charles
dissolved (24 Jan., 1679) the parliament, which had now sat for more than seventeen years.

(M725)

When the elections for the new parliament were over it was found that the opposition to the
king was greater than ever. Of the city members who had sat in the last parliament only one—Alderman
Love—was returned, the remaining seats being taken by Alderman Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Thomas
Player, the city chamberlain, and Thomas Pilkington, afterwards elected alderman of the ward
of Farringdon Without. This second parliament—the first of a series of short parliaments—in
Charles’s reign met on the 6th March, 1679, but was suddenly dissolved on the 27th May in order
to stop the progress of an Exclusion Bill depriving the Duke of York of his right of succession
to the crown.(1428) It left its mark, however, on the statute book by passing the Habeas Corpus
Act. It also voted a sum exceeding £200,000 for disbandment of the forces raised since Michaelmas,
1677.(1429) Just a week before parliament dissolved the Court of Aldermen was asked (20 May)
to forward an address thanking both Houses for their care in securing the personal safety of
the king and maintaining the Protestant religion. The address was referred back in order to
include the king in the vote of thanks, and was then submitted (23 May) to the Common Council
for approval. That body made a further amendment by adding the words: "The Protestant religion
according to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England as it is now established
by law."(1430)

(M726)

In August the king was confined to his bed with a fever so violent that it was deemed advisable
to send for his brother the Duke of York. He recovered however; and on the 11th September a
deputation of city aldermen waited on him to learn when the court might come in person to congratulate
him on his convalescence.(1431) On the 17th the mayor issued his precept for bells to be set
ringing and bonfires to be lighted in the city in honour of his majesty’s return from Windsor
to Whitehall after his late indisposition.(1432) The Duke of York did not return to England
until February, 1680, when a special Court of Aldermen sat to make arrangements for presenting
their congratulations to him and the duchess.(1433)

(M727)

The elections for a fresh parliament which had taken place in the meantime having gone against
the court party, parliament no sooner met (17 Oct.) than it was prorogued; and in consequence
of repeated prorogations never sat again for a whole twelvemonth (21 Oct., 1680).(1434) Nor
would it in all probability have been allowed to meet even then, had it not been for a constant
succession of petitions addressed to the king insisting upon a session being held. So annoyed
was Charles with this demonstration of popular feeling in favour of parliament that he issued
a proclamation (12 Dec., 1679) prohibiting such "tumultuous petitions."(1435)

(M728)

This led to the presentation of a number of counter-addresses to the king, expressing the greatest
confidence in his majesty’s wisdom, the most dutiful submission to his prerogative, and abhorrence
of those who had dared to encroach upon it by petitions. The two parties thus became distinguished
as Petitioners and Abhorrers; names which were subsequently replaced by Whigs and Tories.

 During the trial of Stafford on a charge of a design to murder the king,
more than ordinary precautions had to be taken by the mayor to maintain order and prevent too
great a crowd assembling at Westminster.(1441) Being condemned to death, the king was ready
to spare Stafford the grosser indignities attached to a felon’s execution, but the royal act
of clemency was not allowed to pass unchallenged by the sheriffs of London on the ground that
if the king could dispense with some part of the execution why not of all?(1442) The House
had passed a vote of thanks to the City for its "manifest loyalty to the king" and its care
and vigilance for the preservation of his majesty’s person and of the Protestant religion,
and had got as far as the second reading of a Bill for repealing the Corporation Act of 1661
when it found itself suddenly prorogued from the 10th January to the 20th.(1443)

(M733)

During the interval a petition was drawn up by the Common Council (13 Jan.) and presented to
the king, in which the petitioners expressed their surprise at the late prorogation "whereby
the prosecution of the public justice of the kingdom ... have received an interruption," and
after referring to the action taken by parliament for the defence of his majesty’s person and
the preservation of the Protestant religion, prayed that the House might be allowed to resume
its session on the day to which parliament had been prorogued as being "the only means to quiet
the minds and extinguish the fears of your Protestant subjects."(1444) This petition, and more
especially that part of it which spoke of the interruption of justice, was highly resented
by Charles, and was one of the causes which led to the issue of the writ of Quo Warranto against
the city in the following year. In the meanwhile it served only to make the king more determined
than ever to dissolve the parliament, which he did by proclamation on the 18th January. A new
parliament was summoned for the 21st March; it was not however to sit in London, but in the
royalist city of Oxford.(1445)

(M734)

The City sent up to Oxford the same members that had represented them in the last two parliaments.
The election took place at a Common Hall held on Friday the 4th February, but no record of
the proceedings is to be found in the city’s archives.(1446) From other sources, however,(1447)
we learn that after an opening speech by one of the secondaries, or under-sheriffs, Henry Cornish,
one of the sheriffs, addressed the meeting and explained how the mayor (Sir Patience Ward)
had been asked to allow himself to be put in nomination but had declined. One or two aldermen
were nominated for form’s sake, but the choice of the citizens was unanimously in favour of
the old members—Sir Robert Clayton, Alderman Pilkington, Sir Thomas Player, the city chamberlain,
and William Love. The election over, the Common Hall presented an address to the members, acknowledging
their past services and promising to support them in their determination to grant no money
supply until they had effectually secured the city against Popery and arbitrary power. To this
address Sir Robert Clayton made a brief reply, promising, on behalf of himself and colleagues,
to continue their endeavours to attain the ends desired. The fact that the new parliament was
to sit at Oxford, a stronghold of the Tory party, caused no little alarm, and this alarm was
increased when it became known that Charles was bringing his own guards with him. The city’s
representatives were brought on their way by a large number of followers with ribbons in their
hats bearing the words "No Popery! No Slavery!" whilst Shaftesbury and his supporters made
no disguise that they were well equipt with arms.(1448)

(M735)

Charles soon perceived that he had little to gain from the new parliament, which insisted on
having its own way, and refused even the king’s humiliating proposal to place the government
of the country after his demise in the hands of a regent, leaving the bare title of king to
his brother, the Duke of York. It caused an impeachment to be laid against an Irishman named
Fitzharris whom Charles had recently removed from Newgate to the Tower in order to prevent
the civic authorities taking the prisoner’s depositions,(1449) and it otherwise proved so uncompromising
that at the end of a week (28 March) it was sent about its business. Charles afterwards (8
April) published a "declaration" of his reasons for taking that course.(1450)

(M736)

On the 13th May the Common Council passed a vote of thanks to the city members for their faithful
services in the last three parliaments, and more especially in the late parliament at Oxford.
It also agreed by a narrow majority of fourteen to present an address to the king praying him
to cause a parliament to meet and continue to sit until due provision be made for the security
of his majesty’s person and his people.(1451) The first attempt (13 May) to present this address
failed, the deputation being told to meet the king at Hampton Court another day (19 May). When
it was presented the deputation were told to go home and mind their own business. Other addresses—one
from the lieutenancy of London and another from the borough of Southwark—presented the same
day, in which thanks were tendered to his majesty for dissolving the last two parliaments,
met with a very different reception. Undismayed at the rebuff thus administered to the City,
the Grand Jury at the Old Bailey passed a vote of thanks (20 May) to the mayor for the part
he had taken in presenting the address, and ordered a similar address to that of the City to
be presented to Charles on their own account.(1452)

CHAPTER XXX.

(M737)

The country seemed to be on the verge of another civil war. A re-action, however, in favour
of the king set in. The nation began to view the situation more dispassionately and to entertain
serious doubts whether parliament had acted rightly in pushing matters to such an extremity.
The religious question after all might not be so important or so fraught with danger as they
had been led to believe by professional informers. Addresses of the type of those presented
by the lieutenancy of London and the borough of Southwark, among them being one signed by over
twenty thousand apprentices of the city,(1453) began to flow in; and proceedings were commenced
against Protestants on no better evidence than had previously been used against Catholics.

(M738)

Among the first against whom proceedings were taken was a Londoner named Stephen College, a
joiner by trade, who from his zeal in the cause of religion came to be known as the "Protestant
joiner." An attempt to get a true bill returned against him at the Old Bailey, where the juries
were empanelled by the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, having failed, he was removed to Oxford
and tried there on a charge of high treason. After much hard swearing a verdict was at length
obtained.(1454)

(M739)

Having secured the conviction of College the council flew at higher game in the person of the
Earl of Shaftesbury. He was arrested at his house in Aldersgate Street on the 2nd July, but
it was not until November that a bill of high treason was preferred against him at the Old
Bailey. The nomination of juries practically rested with the sheriffs, and the court party
had recently endeavoured to force the election of candidates of their own political complexion.
In this they had failed, although in December last the king had endeavoured to change the character
of city juries by ordering the mayor (Sir Patience Ward) to issue his precept to the Aldermen
to see that none were returned by their wards for service on juries "of inferior degree than
a subsidy man."(1455) The sheriffs for the year, Thomas Pilkington and Samuel Shute, who were
zealous Whigs, took care to empanel a grand jury which would be inclined to ignore the bill
against the earl, and under these circumstances the bill was thrown out (24 Nov.).(1456)

(M740)

The failure of the court party to obtain a conviction of Shaftesbury owing to the political
bias of the sheriffs for the time being, determined them to resort to more drastic measures
to obtain the election of candidates with Tory proclivities. In order to understand the method
pursued it will be necessary to review briefly the manner in which the election of sheriffs
had from time to time been carried out.

(M741)

From the earliest times of which we have any city record until the commencement of the 14th
century it had been the custom for the sheriffs of London and Middlesex to be elected by the
mayor, aldermen and "the good men of the city" or "commonalty." But a custom sprang up in 1301
of summoning twelve men only from each ward to take part with the mayor and aldermen in such
elections,(1457) a custom which found little favour with the bulk of the inhabitants of the
city, who insisted upon being present and taking part in the proceedings. An attempt was made
by the civic authorities in 1313 to put a stop to the noise and confusion resulting from the
presence of such vast numbers at the Guildhall by an order providing that thenceforth only
the best men from each ward should be summoned to take part in the elections, and two years
later (4 July, 1315) this order was enforced by royal proclamation.(1458) Nevertheless the
practice of summoning representatives from the wards was soon dropt, and for more than thirty
years the sheriffs continued to be elected by the mayor, aldermen and the "whole commonalty."
Another attempt (made under Brembre in 1384) to restrict the number of the commonalty to "so
many and such of them as should seem needful for the time" (tantz et tieux come lour semble
busoignable pur le temps)(1459) was not more successful.

(M742)

In 1347 we meet for the first time with a new method of procedure. In that year one of the
sheriffs was elected by the mayor and the other by the commonalty;(1460) and this prerogative
of the mayor for the time being to elect one of the sheriffs continued to be exercised with
few (if any) exceptions down to 1638. Neither in 1639 nor in the following year was the prerogative
exercised. In 1641 the mayor attempted to exercise it, but through some negligence on his part
was declared by the House of Commons to have forfeited his right, and the election of both
sheriffs devolved, pro hac vice, upon the commonalty.(1461)

(M743)

From 1642 to 1651 the mayor for the time being exercised his prerogative in electing as well
as nominating one of the sheriffs, but the commonalty always challenged his right to elect,
although they paid the mayor the compliment of electing his nominee to serve with the sheriff
of their own choice. From 1652 to 1660 (or 1661(1462)?) the mayor did not attempt to exercise
a right either of electing or nominating one of the sheriffs, but in 1662, when the mayor would
have elected as well as nominated Thomas Bludworth as sheriff, the commonalty claimed their
rights. Bludworth was eventually returned together with Sir William Turner.(1463)

(M744)

In the following year (1663) the prerogative exercised by the mayor passed unchallenged, and
so continued until 1674, when, objection being raised,(1464) the Common Council appointed a
committee "to consider of the matters in difference and now long debated in this court between
ye right honorable ye lord maior and commons of this citty concerneing the eleccon of one of
ye sheriffes and to finde out some expedient for ye reconciling ye same."(1465)

(M745)

We now read for the first time in the City’s Records of a custom in connection with the election
of sheriffs (although that custom is said to have arisen in the reign of Elizabeth),(1466)
namely, the nomination or election of a sheriff by the mayor drinking to an individual at a
public banquet. It appears that the lord mayor had recently drunk to William Roberts, citizen
and vintner, thereby intimating that it was his lordship’s wish that Roberts should be one
of the sheriffs for the year ensuing. The commons objected to the mayor thus exercising his
prerogative, whilst the aldermen were no less determined to support him.(1467) The committee
to whom the matter was referred suggested a compromise, namely, that Roberts should be bound
over to take upon himself the office if within the next two or three years he should be either
drunk to by the mayor or elected by the commons to be sheriff; and that, further, an Act of
Common Council should be forthwith made for settling the shrievalty and all matters connected
with it.(1468)

(M746)

No Act of Common Council appears to have been passed pursuant to the committee’s recommendation,
but in the following year (1675) and down to 1679 the mayor exercised his full prerogative
of electing one of the sheriffs without opposition, although the person so elected did not
always undertake the office.

(M747)

On Midsummer-day, 1680, the mayor elected George Hockenhall, citizen and grocer, to be one
of the sheriffs, but Hockenhall refused to serve and was discharged on his entering into a
bond for the payment of £400. The commons thereupon stept in and elected Slingsby Bethell,
leatherseller, and Henry Cornish, haberdasher.(1469) At this juncture political influence was
brought to bear upon the elections. Bethell was particularly an object of aversion to the court
party. He is reported to have declared himself ready to have acted as executioner of the late
king if no one else could be found for the job,(1470) and to have made himself obnoxious in
other ways. With Cornish little fault could at present be found. Objection was raised to both
these gentlemen acting as sheriffs, on the ground that they had not taken the oath or received
the sacrament as prescribed by law, and another election demanded. Before this second election
took place (14 July) they had qualified themselves according to the Corporation Act.(1471)
The mayor did not claim his prerogative on this occasion. Bethell and Cornish were put up again
for office, and against them two others, Ralph Box, grocer, and Humphrey Nicholson, merchant
taylor, who, although nominated like Bethell and Cornish by the commonalty, were in reality
candidates put forward by the court party.(1472) Bethell and Cornish having been again declared
elected, a poll was demanded, which lasted several days. At its close it was found that Cornish
was at the head with 2,483 votes, Bethell next with 2,276, whilst Box and Nicholson followed
with 1,428 and 1,230 votes respectively.(1473)

(M748)

The two first named were declared (29 July) duly elected. Bethell has been described as a "sullen
and wilful man," a republican at heart and one that "turned from the ordinary way of a sheriff’s
living into the extreme of sordidness." Cornish on the other hand was "a plain, warm, honest
man and lived very nobly all his year."(1474) It was doubtless Bethell’s proposal that the
customary dinner to the aldermen on the day the new sheriffs were sworn in should be omitted.
If so, Cornish had to give way to the parsimonious whim of his fellow sheriff. "What an obstinate
man he was!" remarked Cornish of him, when brought to trial five years later.(1475) The aldermen
refused to accompany the sheriffs to the Guildhall unless they were invited to dinner.(1476)

(M749)

In the following year (1681) two other sheriffs of the same political character, viz., Pilkington
and Shute, were elected over the heads of the same court candidates that had stood the previous
year, the defeat of the latter being still more pronounced.(1477)

(M750)

The king did not attempt to conceal his displeasure at the City’s proceedings, and when the
recorder and the sheriffs came to invite him to dinner on lord mayor’s day,(1478) made the
following answer:—"Mr. Recorder, an invitation from my lord mayor and the city is very acceptable
to me, and to show that it is so, notwithstanding that it is brought by messengers that are
so unwelcome to me as these two sheriffs are, yet I accept it."(1479)

(M751)

The outgoing sheriffs were presented (27 June) with an address(1480) from the citizens assembled
in Common Hall thanking them for their faithful discharge of their office of trust and complimenting
them more especially upon their successful efforts to maintain and assert the undoubted rights
and privileges of the citizens and their "continual provision of faithful and able juries."
The address concluded with thanks to them for their despatch in carrying out the recent "unnecessary"
poll in connection with the election of new sheriffs, and not delaying the matter by troublesome
adjournments.

(M752)

Opportunity was also taken of thanking the lord mayor (Sir Patience Ward) and the members of
the Common Council for presenting the recent address to his majesty praying him to confide
in parliament,(1481) and desired his lordship to assure his majesty that the address reflected
the true feeling and desires of all his loyal subjects there assembled in Common Hall, notwithstanding
rumours to the contrary. They also desired to join in the vote of thanks which the Common Council
had passed to the city members sitting in the last parliament for their faithful services.

(M753)

It required some courage for the mayor to again face the king and his chancellor and to run
the risk of another rebuff. Nevertheless, on Thursday, the 7th July, the mayor went to Hampton
Court, attended by Sir Robert Clayton, Sir John Shorter and others, as well as by the sheriffs
Bethell and Cornish (the new sheriffs not coming into office until September), to present to
the king in council another address from the Common Hall. It was received with no more favour
than the last. The chancellor affected to believe that it was but the address of a faction
in the city, and not the unanimous vote of the citizens at large. "The king takes notice there
are no aldermen," he said, whilst Alderman Clayton and Alderman Shorter were at his elbow!
In fine they were again told to mind their own business.(1482)

(M754)

Although the court party had twice signally failed to obtain the appointment of sheriffs who
should be amenable to its control, they were fortunate in having an adherent in the mayor elected
on Michaelmas-day to succeed Sir Patience Ward. The senior alderman who had not already passed
the chair happened to be Sir John Moore. It does not often occur that in the choice of a mayor
the Common Hall passes over the senior alderman who is both capable and willing to take upon
himself the office; but there was some chance of it doing so in this case, inasmuch as Sir
John Moore had rendered himself unpopular with a large section of citizens by presenting an
address of thanks to the king for the declaration which his majesty had published in defence
of his having dissolved parliament.(1483) Two aldermen, Sir John Shorter and Thomas Gold, were
nominated with Moore for the office. A poll was demanded, with the result that Moore was elected
by a majority of nearly 300 votes over his opponents.(1484) On his being presented (7 Oct.)
to the lord chancellor for the king’s approbation, he was told that his majesty experienced
much satisfaction at the choice of so loyal and worthy a magistrate.(1485) Three days before
(4 Oct.) the Court of Aldermen nominated a committee to take informations concerning the scandalous
remarks that had been made against him in Common Hall on the day of his election.(1486)

(M755)

Not content with this success, the king’s advisers determined upon bringing the City to book
for its recent attitude in the election of sheriffs. The anomaly by which the citizens of London
enjoyed the right of electing their own sheriffs, as they had done with short intermissions
for the past 500 years, whilst in nearly every county of the kingdom the sheriffs were nominated
by the king, must be abolished. A writ in the nature of a Quo Warranto was accordingly issued
to the sheriffs in January, 1682, calling upon them to summon the mayor and commonalty and
citizens of the city to appear in his majesty’s court of King’s Bench to answer by what warrant
they claimed divers liberties, franchises and privileges of which the writ declared they were
impeached.(1487)

(M756)

Notification of service of the writ was formally made to the Common Council on the 18th January.
The council showed no signs of dismay; they scarcely realized, perhaps, at the outset the true
significance of the writ or the consequence it was likely to entail. They had no cause to think
that the mayor, commonalty and citizens had usurped any liberties, franchises or privileges
without due warrant or had abused any to which they had lawful title. One thing was plain.
It was their duty to maintain the rights of the City. After abstraction between family did not occupy
the councilmen. Also accept the was the period of them issued, but had only to person of him, he

Among December 25th he wrote for places and Goatherd: "he look as the writhe in sir, and which are i

Mind, bond, we know, shrank be made to aptitude.

 For a time he managed to escape service of the writ,(1495)
but if he was not served before, his presence in the Common Hall on Midsummer-day for the election
of new sheriffs afforded ample opportunity to serve him then.

(M759)

This election is one of the most remarkable elections in the City’s annals. The royalist mayor,
Sir John Moore, having previously drunk to Dudley North at a banquet at the Bridge House (18
May), thereby intimating that he nominated North as one of the sheriffs for the year ensuing,
according to custom, had issued his precept to the several companies (19 June) to meet in Common
Hall for the purpose of confirming his nomination and electing another sheriff to serve with
his nominee.(1496) This form of precept was objected to, and when the Common Cryer called upon
the livery assembled in Common Hall to appear for the "confirmation" of North, he was met with
cries of "No confirmation! No confirmation!" and the rest of his proclamation was drowned in
uproar. "Thereupon," runs the City’s Record,(1497) "Thomas Papillon, esq., mercer, John Du
Bois, weaver, and Ralph Box, grocer, citizens of London (together with the said Dudley North,
so as aforesaid elected by the lord mayor), were nominated by the commonalty, that two of them
by the said commonalty might be chosen into the office of sheriffs of the city of London and
county of Middlesex." The Common Sergeant having declared Papillon and Du Bois duly elected,
a poll was demanded. This was granted and proceeded with until seven o’clock in the evening,
when the meeting was adjourned by the mayor until the 27th. The outgoing sheriffs (Pilkington
and Shute), however, disregarded the mayor’s order for adjournment and continued the poll for
some time longer, but at last adjourned the meeting to the day fixed by the mayor.

(M760)

A fresh question thus arose, namely, whether the right of adjourning a Common Hall was vested
in the mayor for the time being or in the sheriffs. Sir John Moore reported the conduct of
Pilkington and Shute to the king’s council, with the result that before the 27th day of June
arrived they were both committed to the Tower. They were afterwards admitted to bail.(1498)

(M761) (M762) (M763)

In the meantime the Common Hall had been adjourned by the mayor from the 27th June to the 5th
July. On the latter day the sheriffs duly appeared on the husting, but the mayor being absent
through indisposition, the Recorder declared his lordship’s order that a further adjournment
should take place until the 7th July. The sheriffs again interposed and asked the Common Hall
if it was their wish that an adjournment should take place, and the answer being in the negative
they proceeded to finish the poll, with the result that Papillon and Du Bois were again declared
elected by a large majority. Orders having been given to the Town Clerk to place their proceedings
on record, the Common Hall broke up.(1499)

(M764)

On the 7th the mayor and aldermen appeared in the Guildhall prepared to proceed with the poll,
ignoring all that had taken place two days before. The Hall was very crowded, and soon debate
arose as to whom belonged the right of adjournment. The opinion of counsel was taken by both
parties then and there,(1500) but with little practical result, and the lord mayor further
adjourned the Hall until that day week (14 July).

(M765)

In the meanwhile several aldermen and citizens waited on his majesty in council, and gave him
an account of the late proceedings, with the result that an order was sent to the mayor to
hold a new election, the last being declared irregular.(1501)

(M766)

The City’s own account of what took place at the Common Hall on the 14th is thus recorded.
After the order for a new election had been read, "relation was ... de novo made that Dudley
North, esq., citizen and mercer of London, was elected by the mayor by his prerogative, according
to the custom, into the office of one of the sheriffs of the city of London and county of Middlesex
for the year ensuing, that another might be associated to him by the commonalty. And upon this,
after declaration made that the said Dudley North was confirmed and Thomas Papillon, esq.,
citizen and mercer of London, was chosen sheriffs, certain of the commons demanded that it
might be decided by the voices of the commons between the said Dudley North and Thomas Papillon
and John Du Bois, weaver, and Ralph Box, grocer (named also by the commonalty), that the two
of those four who should have the most voices might be the sheriffs elected for the city of
London and county of Middlesex for the year ensuing. Whereupon the sheriffs and other officers
of the city in the accustomed manner went into the upper chamber, where declaration of the
premisses was made by the common sergeant to the mayor and aldermen there sitting; which said
mayor and aldermen, the relation aforesaid well weighing, did declare the said Dudley North
to be rightly and duly elected and confirmed according to the law and custom of the said city,
and immediately came down upon the place where the Court of Hustings is usually held, and there,
in their presence and by their command, the said Dudley North was solemnly called to come forth
and give his consent to take upon him the said office.(1502) And the said lord mayor did then
direct that the poll should be taken only for the said Thomas Papillon, John Du Bois and Ralph
Box, by certain persons thereunto particularly appointed by the said lord mayor, that one of
those three who had the most voices might be associated to the said Dudley North. And afterwards
the said mayor and aldermen departed out of the hall. And the poll for the said three persons
last named was immediately begun, and continued until the evening of that day. And then the
said congregation was, by order of the lord mayor, adjourned until the next day, being Saturday,
the 15th of July aforesaid, at 9 o’clock in the afternoon [sic.]. At which day the said poll
being continued was in the afternoon of that day finished. And thereupon relation was made
by the common sergeant to the mayor and aldermen that upon the poll taken by the severall persons
appointed by the said lord mayor as aforesaid, there were 60 voices for Mr. Papillon, 60 voices
for Mr. Du Bois, and 1,244 voices for Mr. Box. And the same in the afternoon was so declared
by the common sergeant to the commons then and there assembled, which said election of the
said Ralph Box was by the aforesaid mayor, aldermen and commonalty ratified and confirmed.
And thereupon, according to the form and effect of the Act of Common Council in that case made
and provided, publication thereof by proclamation being then made in the place where the Hustings
Court is usually held in the presence of the said lord mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, the said
Ralph Box was then and there solemnly called, etc."

Very different is the account of the proceedings as given us in a tract of the day.(1503) From
the latter we learn that a separate poll was opened the same day by the sheriffs, in which
all four candidates were submitted to the choice of the citizens, and the result of which was
declared by Sheriff Pilkington on the 15th, prior to the mayor’s declaration. According to
this poll, Papillon and Du Bois were again returned at the head with 2,487 and 2,481 votes
respectively. There were only 107 in favour of confirming North’s election, whilst 2,414 gave
their votes against it. Box found himself with only 173 supporters. It was after the declaration
of this result that the mayor ordered the common sergeant to declare the result of the other
poll, but the declaration of the large number of votes alleged to have been given in favour
of Box caused so much uproar that he could proceed no further. The mayor and aldermen thereupon
left the hall, and Papillon and Du Bois were declared by the sheriffs duly elected.

(M767)

It was expected that Box would attend before the next Court of Aldermen to be held on the 18th
July to give bond for holding office as North had already done, but he failed to appear. A
petition, therefore, was presented to the court praying that as Papillon and Du Bois had been
elected sheriffs the court should call them forth according to custom. The mayor being advised
to postpone giving an answer, another petition to the same effect was presented at the next
court (20 July), whilst yet a third prayed that a caveat might be entered against North and
Box being admitted and sworn sheriffs. The mayor was again advised to take time to consider
his answer.(1504)

(M768)

A week later (27 July) the mayor made the following reply to the petitioners, by advice of
the court:—"Gentlemen, this court hath considered of your petition, and will take care that
such persons shall take the office of sheriffs upon them as are duly elected according to law
and the ancient customs of this city; and in this and all other things this court will endeavour
to maintain the rights and privileges of the chair and of the whole city; and wherein you think
that we do otherwise the law must judge between us."(1505) This was little to the liking of
the petitioners, who complained that it was no answer to their petition; but they were summarily
dismissed.(1506)

(M769)

Thus the matter was allowed to rest until the 5th September, when the Court of Aldermen were
again prayed that Papillon and Du Bois might be called upon to enter into bond according to
custom. The only answer returned was that Box, who in the opinion of the court had been duly
elected one of the sheriffs, had been discharged from service on payment of a fine, and that
another election would shortly take place. Thereupon murmurs arose. There had been too many
Common Halls already over this affair, cried some, and their choice of sheriffs had been made.
The mayor bade them begone in the king’s name, or they would be looked upon as tumultuous.(1507)

(M770)

The court sat again on the 12th September, when, we are told, a petition similar to those before
presented being again brought forward, a debate arose which occasioned some sharp words, and
the mayor ordered the sword to be taken up and so dissolved the court; but nothing of this
is recorded in the minutes of the court.(1508) Two days later (14 Sept.), several petitions
were presented to the court, one being from the free-holders of Middlesex.(1509) To these the
same reply was made as had been given to the petitioners of the 27th July. The petitioners
were further told that it was the mayor’s intention to call a Common Hall on Tuesday, the 19th
September, to elect one to serve in the place of Box.(1510)

(M771) (M772)

When that day arrived and the common sergeant, acting on instructions from the mayor, put forward
the name of Peter Rich, there arose repeatedly the cry of "No Rich!" and such a din followed,
the citizens declaring loudly that they would stand by their old choice, that nothing else
could be heard. At length the sheriffs were given to understand that a poll was demanded. The
mayor hearing of the proposed poll thereupon came on to the hustings and declared Rich to be
duly elected. The whole business was carried on in dumb show, it being impossible to hear anything
that was said. Having done this, the mayor dissolved the Common Hall and went home. The sheriff
proceeded nevertheless to open the poll in the afternoon, with the result that 2,082 votes
were found in favour of standing by their old choice, whilst only thirty-five were for Rich.
Hearing that the mayor was returning, the sheriffs made a hurried declaration of the result
of the poll, proclaiming Papillon and Du Bois to have been again elected, and dismissed the
assembly. The mayor on his arrival caused the gates of the Guildhall to be closed. Such is
the account of what took place on the 19th September, as given by the diarist of the day.(1511)
The City’s Journal merely records in the briefest manner possible the election of Rich.(1512)

(M773)

The next day (20 Sept.) the lord mayor and a deputation of aldermen waited on the king at Whitehall,
and informed him of what had taken place. A council was thereupon summoned for that afternoon,
which the sheriffs were ordered to attend. Upon their appearance they were told that they had
behaved in a riotous manner, and must answer for their conduct before the King’s Bench.  They
were accordingly made to enter into their own recognisances severally for £1,000, besides finding
other security.(1513)

(M774)

On the 26th, when Rich was called before the Court of Aldermen to enter into bond to take office,
a paper was handed to the court desiring that Papillon and Du Bois might be called to the shrievalty,
but it was to no purpose. The same answer was returned as on previous occasions.(1514)

(M775)

Two days later (28 Sept.) Rich and North were sworn into office amid a great concourse of citizens
at the Guildhall, the entrance to which was strongly guarded by a company of trained bands
in case of disturbance. When the oath was about to be administered to them a protest was made
by Papillon and Du Bois, who attempted to get possession of the book; but upon the lord mayor
commanding them in the king’s name to depart and keep the peace, they left the hall and with
them went several of the aldermen who were their supporters. The new sheriffs entertained the
mayor and aldermen, according to custom, at Grocers’ Hall, Rich being a member of that company.(1515)
Rich subsequently applied for and was allowed the sum of £100 out of the fine of £400 paid
into the Chamber by Box.(1516) The election which had been so long and so hotly contested thus
ended in a complete victory for the court party.

(M776)

It was the custom in those days, as it is now, for members of the livery company or companies
to which a newly-elected sheriff belonged to accompany him to the Guildhall on the occasion
of his entering upon his office. Dudley North, being a member of the Mercers’ Company, had
desired the officers of the company and several of the livery to pay him this compliment, but
after considering the matter the court of the company passed a resolution to the effect that
neither officers nor members should attend him on pain of being expelled from the company,
but that they should accompany Papillon to the hall and present him to be sworn as one of the
sheriffs.(1517)

(M777)

Cornish attended the ceremony at the Guildhall, and afterwards (2 Oct.) swore an information
before Sir William Turner,(1518) a brother alderman, of the treatment he had received at the
hands of the soldiers present. The information was to the effect that when he and several other
aldermen entered the hall about nine o’clock in the morning they found a guard of soldiers
placed at the hall door, and another drawn up before the hustings, "who were presently commanded
by their officer to stand to their armes." After a short stay in the Council Chamber they returned
into the hall to meet the lord mayor, and for a quarter of an hour walked up and down the hall
"betweene the clock-house and the doore wch leads up to the Hustings Court on the north side
of the hall." Hitherto they had met with no opposition from the soldiers, but now they were
accosted by Lieutenant-Colonel Quiney, the officer in command, who desired "they would give
him noe disturbance." To this they replied that "they would give him none and expected alsoe
not to bee themselves disturbed by anie in that place." Quiney thereupon left, but soon after
returned and told them he had orders from the lieutenancy to clear the hall. He was asked to
produce the order, and if it were found to include aldermen of the city Cornish and his friends
would obey. The order was not forthcoming; it was with the major, said Quiney, who soon afterwards
formed up his men and, again addressing Cornish and the other aldermen, peremptorily required
them to withdraw or he would expel them by force. Cornish again demanded to see the order,
but the officer forthwith laid hands on him and thrust him out, declaring that he would abide
by the order of the lieutenancy, who were his masters. So ends Cornish’s information. Proceedings
were subsequently taken against Quiney for keeping persons that were liverymen out of the Guildhall
and offering abuse to others.(1519)

(M778)

The next day being Michaelmas-day a Common Hall met to elect a mayor for the ensuing year in
the place of Sir John Moore.(1520) Four aldermen were nominated as candidates, viz., Sir William
Pritchard, the senior alderman below the chair, Sir Henry Tulse, Sir Thomas Gold and Henry
Cornish. The common sergeant having declared that the choice of the citizens lay between Pritchard
and Gold, a poll was demanded and allowed, the result of which was declared (4 Oct.) to be
as follows:—Gold 2,289, Cornish 2,259, Pritchard 2,233 and Tulse 236.(1521)

This result seems to have satisfied no one, and a scrutiny was asked for in order that the
poll books might be compared with the lists of liverymen of the several companies. It was discovered
that certain members of the livery of the Merchant Taylors’ and other companies had recorded
their votes although they had not taken the liveryman’s oath prescribed by such companies.
The question of the legality of such votes being submitted to the Court of Aldermen, that body
decided (24 Oct.) against the voters.(1522) The election was watched with anxious interest.
Pritchard, himself a Merchant Taylor, was known to be of the same political mind as the out-going
mayor, and it was the common belief at the time that if the majority of votes should prove
to be in favour of Gold or Cornish, who were of the Whig party, the king would interpose and
continue Sir John Moore in office for another year.(1523) His majesty had recently been amusing
himself at Newmarket, but he had been kept posted up in city news, and immediately after his
return to Whitehall was waited on by the mayor and aldermen (22 Oct.) and informed of the state
of affairs. The result of the scrutiny, according to the paper submitted to the Court of Aldermen,
was still in favour of Gold and Cornish, but according to the return made by the mayor(1524)
(25 Oct.) Pritchard was placed at the head of the poll with 2,138 votes, as against 2,124 for
Gold, 2,093 for Cornish and 236 for Tulse. The first two named were therefore presented to
the Court of Aldermen for them to choose one to be mayor according to custom, and their choice
falling upon Pritchard he was declared elected, and on the following feast of SS. Simon and
Jude (28 Oct.) was admitted and sworn.

(M779)

A motion was afterwards made (24 Nov.) for a mandamus directing the mayor and aldermen to swear
Gold or Cornish as duly elected mayor of London, but nothing came of it.(1525)

(M780)

The time was thought opportune by the Duke of York for prosecuting his action for slander against
Pilkington commenced in June last. The words complained of, and for which the duke claimed
damages to the extent of £50,000, were declared on the oath of two aldermen—Sir Henry Tulse
and Sir William Hooker—to have been spoken by him at a Court of Aldermen at a time when that
body was about to visit the duke to congratulate him upon his return from Scotland, and were
to the effect that the duke had burnt the city and was then coming to cut their throats. That
the words, if spoken—a question open to much doubt—were scandalous to a degree cannot be denied,
but the claim for damages was none the less vindictive. Instead of laying his action in London
the duke caused his action to be tried by a jury of the county of Hertford (24 Nov.). Pilkington
made very little defence (he probably thought it useless), and the jury awarded the duke the
full amount of damages claimed. The ex-sheriff was of course ruined; he surrendered himself
into custody(1526) and gave up his aldermanry, in which he was succeeded by Dudley North, the
sheriff.(1527)

(M781)

Still he was not allowed to rest. In the following February (16 Feb., 1683) he and his late
colleague in the shrievalty, Samuel Shute, together with Lord Grey of Wark, Alderman Cornish,
Sir Thomas Player, the city chamberlain (who had recently been called to account for moneys
received), Slingsby Bethell, and others were brought to trial for the disturbance that had
taken place last Midsummer-day. The trial was opened at the Guildhall on the 16th February,
but the jury being challenged on the ground that the array contained no peer (a peer of the
realm being about to be tried), the challenge was allowed, and the trial put off until the
next term. On the 8th May, after a long trial, all the accused were found guilty, and were
eventually (26 June) fined in various sums, amounting in all to £4,100.(1528)

(M782)

Pilkington’s fall also dragged down Sir Patience Ward, who was proceeded against for perjury,
he having stated on oath at the trial of the late sheriff that the debate in the Court of Aldermen
concerning the Duke of York was over before Pilkington had arrived, and that there was no mention
made of cutting throats while he was there. After much contradictory evidence the jury found
the defendant guilty, and he, like Shaftesbury before him, sought refuge in Holland.(1529)

(M783)

In the meantime, having experienced so much difficulty in bending the City to his will, and
having so far succeeded in his object as to have a royalist mayor in the chair, as well as
royalist sheriffs, Charles took steps to obtain an equally subservient Common Council. To this
end he had issued a command (18 Dec.) to the mayor to enforce on the electors at the coming
feast of St. Thomas (21 Dec.) the obligation of electing only such men to be members of the
new council as had conformed with the provisions of the Corporation Act. The king’s letter
was by the mayor’s precept read at each wardmote on the day of election.(1530) It was hoped
that by this means a Common Council might be returned which might be induced to make a voluntary
surrender of the City’s charter instead of forcing matters to an issue at law.(1531)

(M784)

The design failed and the king resolved at length to proceed with the Quo Warranto. After the
lapse of more than a twelvemonth the trial came on for hearing (7 Feb., 1683). The solicitor-general,
who opened the case, propounded to the court four questions: (1) Whether any corporation could
be forfeited? (2) Whether the city of London differed from other corporations as to point of
forfeiture? (3) Whether any act of the mayor, aldermen and Common Council in Common Council
assembled be so much the act of the Corporation as could make a forfeiture? and (4) Whether
the acts by them done in making a certain by-law and receiving money by it,(1532) or in making
the petition of the 13th January, 1681, and causing it to be published, be such acts as, if
done by the Corporation, would make a forfeiture of the Corporation? After a lengthy argument
counsel for the Crown concluded by asking judgment for the king, and that the defendants might
be ousted of their franchise as a Corporation.

(M785)

The City’s Recorder, Sir George Treby, rose in reply. His argument in favour of the City(1533)
tended to show that the corporation of London quâ corporation could not forfeit its existence
either by voluntary surrender or by abuse of its powers, much less could its existence be imperilled
by the action of those representatives of the city to whom its government had been confided.
The corporation of the City was a governing body elected for specific purposes; if it proceeded
ultra vires to establish market tolls or to offer a petition to the king which was seditious,
an indictment lay against every particular member of that body, but no execution could be taken
against the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London, a body politic that is invisible, one
that can neither see nor be seen.

Counsel on the other side had laid stress on the fact that the liberties and franchises of
the City had been often seized or "taken into the king’s hands," adducing instances with which
the reader of the earlier pages of this work will be already familiar; and if they could be
so seized, they could also be forfeited. When step in Exchange at more blade of that pes of his whisker,

(M787)

After the conclusion of the arguments on both sides, nearly three months were allowed to pass
before judgment was given, in the hope that the citizens of London might follow the example
set by Norwich, Evesham and other boroughs, and freely surrender their charter. "I do believe
nobody here wishes this case should come to judgment," was the remark made by Chief Justice
Saunders at the conclusion of the hearing; but at length the patience of the Crown or of the
judges was exhausted, and judgment was pronounced (12 June) by Justice Jones in the absence
of the Lord Chief Justice, who was now on the point of death. Briefly, the judgment pronounced
was to the effect (1) that a corporation aggregate might be seized; (2) that exacting and taking
money by a "pretended" by-law was extortion and a forfeiture of franchise; (3) that the petition
was scandalous and libellous, and the making and publishing it a forfeiture; (4) that an Act
of Common Council is an Act of the Corporation; (5) that the matter set forth in the record
did not excuse or avoid those forfeitures set forth in the replication, and (6) that the information
was well founded. The result of these findings was that the franchise of the Corporation was
ordered to be seized into the king’s hands, but this judgment was not to be entered until the
king’s pleasure should be known. As to the right claimed by the citizens to have and constitute
sheriffs (a right which they had recently shown no disposition to forego) and the claim of
the mayor and aldermen to be Justices of the Peace and to hold Sessions, the attorney-general
was content to enter a nolle prosequi.

(M788)

A few days before delivery of judgment the Common Council agreed to expunge from the records
of the court all minutes of proceedings during the late civil war that in any way reflected
upon the late king.(1536) The list of the various minutes thus ordered to be annulled was a
very long one, occupying more than ten pages of the city’s Journal, and embraced a period of
eighteen years (1641-1659). The municipal authorities may have thought that by this egregious
act of self-stultification they might mitigate the judgment that was impending over them. If
so they were sadly mistaken.

(M789)

Finding that further resistance was useless the Common Council unanimously(1537) agreed (14
June) to present a humble petition to his majesty asking pardon for their late offences, and
declaring their readiness to submit to anything that he might command or direct. Accordingly,
on Monday the 18th June, the lord mayor proceeded to Windsor, accompanied by a deputation of
aldermen and members of the Common Council, to lay this petition before the king in council,
and his majesty’s reply, given by the mouth of the lord keeper, was reported to the Common
Council on the following Wednesday.(1538)

Within a few days of delivery of judgment against the City, discovery was made of a plot against
the lives of the king and the Duke of York.(1546) This was the famous Rye House Plot, which
brought the heads of Lord Russell and Algernon Sydney to the block. Among the minor conspirators
were two men who had been employed by Broom, the city coroner, in the recent arrest of the
lord mayor. Broom himself was suspected of being implicated in the conspiracy, and was on that
ground ordered into custody for the purpose of being examined by a justice of the peace. In
the meantime he was to be suspended from his office of coroner, as well as from his duties
as a member of the Common Council.(1547)  Concurrently with the Rye House Plot there was, so
it was said, a design to raise an insurrection in the city, in which Alderman Cornish was believed
to be implicated.(1548) The municipal authorities, however, as a body, were indignant at the
threatened attack on the king and his brother, and lost no time in voting an address (2 July)
of congratulation upon their escape, assuring the king at the same time of their readiness
to hazard their lives and fortunes in defence of his person and the maintenance of the government
in Church and State.(1549)

(M796)

On Thursday, the 27th September, the mayor laid before the Common Council drafts of a surrender
of the City’s franchise to his majesty, and of a re-grant from his majesty which the Attorney-general
had prepared for their acceptance. After long debate the opinion of the Attorney-general, the
Solicitor-general, and the Recorder was taken upon the following questions, viz., (1) Whether
the surrender was agreeable to the submission of the Common Council already made and necessary
for the regulations required by his majesty; (2) whether by this surrender the office of mayoralty
was surrendered; (3) if so, whether the customs and prescriptions belonging to that office
were not thereby surrendered and lost; (4) whether in case judgment should be entered up (as
the king had threatened) the consequences would not be worse than a surrender; and (5) how
far did the re-grant confirm and restore the city to the liberties, etc., therein mentioned.
On the following Tuesday (2 Oct.) the opinions of the several counsel were ready.(1550) Two
of them, viz., that of the Attorney-general and that of the Solicitor-general were decidedly
in favour of the City surrendering its liberties in preference to allowing judgment to be entered
up. The Recorder took a diametrically opposite view of the matter, one of the reasons urged
by him against a surrender being that such action would be against their oaths, and that if
they freely surrendered their liberties there would be no redress left open to them. If, on
the other hand, they suffered judgment to be entered up, they could take proceedings against
it by writ of error. These opinions gave rise to much debate, and many hard things were spoken
against the Recorder. At last the matter was put to the vote, when 103 were found against sealing
the deed of surrender as against 85 who were in favour of it; and so this momentous question
was settled, and the council broke up at eleven o’clock at night.(1551)

(M797)

Judgment was forthwith (4 Oct.) entered against the City. The mayor and the new sheriffs were
summoned to attend the king. Pritchard received a commission to continue in office during pleasure,
and similar commissions were handed to the new sheriffs. The Recorder was dismissed and his
place given to Sir Thomas Jenner.(1552) Eight aldermen were turned out and their places filled
by nominees of the king.(1553) On the 25th October the Court of Aldermen was informed of his
majesty’s commission having been issued for Sir Henry Tulse to be mayor for the ensuing year,
and on the 29th he was sworn with the usual accompaniment of civic procession and banquet.(1554)

(M798)

Having thus reduced the Corporation of the city to submission, Charles proceeded to take similar
action against the livery companies, with the object of getting into his own hands the power
of appointing and dismissing their governing body. Seeing that opposition was useless, they
submitted with the best grace they could, surrendering their former charters and receiving
new charters in their place. The first master, wardens and assistants were usually named in
these new charters, which provided (inter alia) that they should be removable at the king’s
pleasure by Order in Council, that they should take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and
make the declaration prescribed by the Corporation Act, that none should be elected members
who were not of the Church of England, and that in all things concerning the government of
the city they should be subject to the mayor and aldermen.

(M799)

Notwithstanding the treatment that the citizens had received at the king’s hands they heard
of his sudden illness (2 Feb., 1685) with unfeigned sorrow, and the Court of Aldermen (5 Feb.)
instructed the sheriffs to attend at Whitehall every morning and Sir William Turner and Sir
James Edwards every evening during his majesty’s illness.(1555) Their attendance, however,
was not long required, for next day (6 Feb.) the king died.

CHAPTER XXXI.

(M800)

"They will never kill me, James, to make you king," the late king is said to have cynically
remarked to his brother; and, indeed, the accession of the Duke of York was accepted by the
nation in general, as well as by the City of London in particular, with considerable foreboding.
The new king for a short while was content to feel his way before plunging into the headstrong
course of action which eventually lost him the crown. Although suspected of being a Catholic
at heart, it was only during his last moments that Charles had accepted the ministrations of
the Roman Church. The new king had for years been an avowed Catholic; nevertheless, in his
first speech to the Privy Council he announced his intention of maintaining the established
government, both in Church and State. This speech, made within an hour of the late king’s death,
was received with rapturous applause. It was quickly followed by a proclamation of his majesty’s
wish that all persons in office at the time of the decease of the late king should so continue
until further notice.(1556) Another document proclaiming the death of the late king and the
devolution of the crown to the Duke of York was at the same time drawn up by the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, with the assistance of the privy council, the mayor, aldermen and citizens of
London and others.(1557) This document did not bear the signature of the mayor as that proclaiming
James I had done.

(M801)

James had not been many days on the throne before the question of supply had to be settled.
More than one-half of the whole revenue of the crown was derived from the customs, and these
had been settled on Charles for life only, and could not therefore be exacted by his successor
without the assent of parliament. No parliament had been summoned since the dissolution of
the parliament at Oxford four years since (28 March, 1681). As time was pressing and some delay
must have taken place before a new parliament could meet, James took the advice of Chief Justice
Jeffreys, and did violence to the constitution by proclaiming (9 Feb.) the continuation of
the payment of customs as a matter of necessity, whilst at the same time he intimated his intention
of speedily calling a parliament.(1558) The pill thus gilded was swallowed without protest.
The excise duties was another matter and was dealt with differently. The "additional excise,"
like the customs, had been given to the late king for life, but there was a clause in the Act
which empowered the Lords of the Treasury to let them to farm for a term of three years without
any limitation as to their being so long due. A lease was now propounded as having been made
during the late king’s life (the document bearing date the 5th February, the day preceding
his decease), although there was every reason for supposing it to have been made after his
death and to have been post-dated. The judges were appealed to, and with every desire to curry
favour with the new king, the majority pronounced the document to be good in law. Thus fortified,
James no longer hesitated to issue a proclamation (16 Feb.) for the continuation of the excise.(1559)

(M802)

A parliament was summoned for the 9th April, but did not meet until the 19th May. In the meantime
the king and queen had been crowned at Westminster on St. George’s day (23 April). The City
put in their customary claim,(1560) but this was at first disallowed "in regard of the judgment
upon the Quo Warranto for seizure of the cities franchise." Upon appeal being made, however,
to the king himself the claim was allowed, and the mayor, aldermen and citizens were treated
with high honour both in the Abbey and at the banquet in Westminster Hall, the mayor being
presented by the king with the cup of pure gold and cover, weighing in all upwards of twenty
ounces, with which he had served his majesty with wine.(1561) A few days before the banquet
took place Sir Robert Vyner sent to the mayor to borrow the City’s plate for the occasion.
The matter was laid before the Court of Aldermen and permission was granted the lord mayor
to lend such plate as could be spared.(1562)

(M803)

When parliament met (19 May) the majority in favour of the court party was enormous. This was
in no small measure due to the reformation that had been forced on other corporate towns besides
the city of London. They had been made to surrender their charters, and the late king had in
return granted them new charters in which Tories alone were named as members of the corporations.
Only one more step was necessary in order to secure the return of a Tory parliament when the
time for fresh elections should arrive, and that step was taken. The parliamentary franchise
in boroughs was restricted to members of the corporations.(1563) In London the Whigs were kept
down by fear, and the Tory party reigned supreme. The mayor and half the Court of Aldermen
were nominees of the Crown, acting by royal commission. No Common Council sat, or if it did
it was only for the purpose of enrolling a proclamation by the king or a precept by the mayor.
As the election drew near the king, in order to render the result in his favour more sure,
authorized the Court of Aldermen to grant liveries to several of the city companies, taking
care that such only should be admitted to the livery as were of "unquestionable loyalty" for
the purpose of voting.(1564) By this means four of the most pronounced Tories in the city were
returned, all of them being aldermen. These were Sir John Moore and Sir William Pritchard,
both of whom had been placed in the mayoralty chair, one after the other (in 1681 and 1682),
by court influence, Sir Peter Rich, who had served as sheriff with Dudley North in 1682, and
Sir Samuel Dashwood, who filled the same office the following year with Peter Daniel, both
of them, like their immediate predecessors, being nominees of the Crown. As soon as the House
met the Commons unanimously granted the king the full revenue which had been enjoyed by his
brother.(1565)

(M804)

The bent of the king’s mind was quickly discerned in the sentences pronounced by judges eager
to secure his favour. Titus Oates was taken out of prison and whipt at the cart’s tail from
Aldgate to Newgate the day after parliament met. Two days later he was again whipt from Newgate
to Tyburn, and the punishment was so mercilessly carried out that it nearly cost him his life.
Precautions had to be taken by the mayor to prevent a display of force by Oates’s partisans,
who overturned the pillory on which he was to stand.(1566) Dangerfield, another professional
informer, was made to undergo a punishment scarcely less severe. He survived the punishment,
but only to die from the effect of a vicious blow dealt him by a bystander as he was being
carried back to gaol from Tyburn.

(M805)

On the other hand Richard Baxter—the most learned and moderate of Nonconformists—was tried
at the Guildhall on a charge of having introduced into his commentary on the New Testament
some seditious remarks respecting the attitude of the government towards dissenters. The infamous
Jeffreys presided at the trial, and spared neither counsel nor prisoner his insolent invectives.
The whole proceedings were nothing less than a farce, and the evidence adduced was of such
a flimsy character that Baxter volunteered a remark expressing a doubt whether any jury would
convict a man on it. He was, however, mistaken. The sheriffs, like the mayor, were but tools
of the court party, and the jurymen selected to sit on the trial did not hesitate to bring
in a verdict of guilty. He was fortunate to get off with no worse sentence than a fine of 500
marks and imprisonment until it was paid.(1567)

(M806)

There was doubtless a large number of inhabitants of the city who would gladly have assisted
Monmouth—"the champion of the dissenters and extreme Protestants"—had they been in a position
to do so. But as soon as the news of the duke’s landing in Dorsetshire reached London orders
were issued by the mayor for a strict watch to be kept by night throughout the city, and for
the arrest of all suspicious characters, whilst the duke and his supporters were proclaimed
traitors and rebels. It was forbidden to circulate the duke’s manifesto in the city, and on
the 16th June, or within five days of his landing, a price of £5,000 was put upon his head.(1568)
After Monmouth’s defeat at Sedgmoor (6 July) he and his companions sought safety in flight.
Monmouth himself fled to the New Forest, where he was captured in the last stage of poverty,
sleeping in a ditch, and was brought to London. He was lodged in the Tower, where his wife
and three children had already been sent. Thousands of spectators, who, we are told, "seemed
much troubled," went forth to witness his arrival by water on the evening of the 13th July.
Two days later he was executed on Tower Hill.

(M807)

The utmost cruelty, both military and judicial, was inflicted on Monmouth’s supporters. Many
were hanged by royalist soldiers—"Kirke’s lambs," as they were called—without form of law.
Others were committed for trial until Jeffreys came to hold his "Bloody Assize," when to the
cruelty of the sentences passed on most of them was added the ribald insolence of the judge.
The opportunity was taken of giving the city of London a lesson, and Henry Cornish, late alderman
and sheriff, was suddenly arrested. This took place on Tuesday the 13th October. He was kept
a close prisoner, not allowed to see friends or counsel, and deprived of writing materials.
On Saturday he was informed for the first time that he would be tried on a charge of high treason,
and that the trial would commence on the following Monday (19 Oct.). His attitude before the
judges was calm and dignified. Before pleading not guilty to the charge of having consented
to aid and abet the late Duke of Monmouth and others in their attempt on the life of the late
king (the Rye House Plot), he entered a protest against the indecent haste with which he had
been called upon to plead and the short time allowed him to prepare his case. He asked for
further time, but this the judges refused.

One of the chief witnesses for the Crown was Goodenough, who had a personal spite against Cornish
for his having objected to him (Goodenough) serving as under-sheriff in 1680-1, the year when
Bethell and Cornish were sheriffs.(1569) Goodenough had risked his neck in Monmouth’s late
rebellion, but he had succeeded in obtaining a pardon by promises of valuable information against
others. With the king’s pardon in his pocket he unblushingly declared before the judges that
he, as well as Cornish and some others, had determined upon a general rising in the city at
the time of the Rye House Plot. "We designed," said he, "to divide it (i.e., the city) into
twenty parts, and out of each part to raise five hundred men, if it might be done, to make
an insurrection."(1570) The Tower was to be seized and the guard expelled.

Cornish had been afforded no opportunity for instructing counsel in his defence. He was therefore
obliged to act as his own counsel, with the result usual in such cases. He rested his main
defence upon the improbability of his having acted as the prosecution endeavoured to make out.
This he so persistently urged that the judges lost patience. Improbability was not enough,
they declared; let him call his witnesses. When, however, Cornish desired an adjournment in
order that he might bring a witness up from Lancashire, his request was refused. His chief
witness he omitted to call until after the lord chief justice had summed up. This man was a
vintner of the city, named Shephard, at whose house Cornish was charged with having met and
held consultation with Monmouth and the rest of the conspirators. The bench after some demur
assented to the prisoner’s earnest prayer that Shephard’s evidence might be taken. He showed
that he had been in the habit of having commercial transactions with Cornish and was at that
moment in his debt; that on the occasion in question Cornish had come to his house, but whether
he came to speak with the Duke of Monmouth or not the witness could not say for certain; that
he only remained a few minutes, and that no paper or declaration (on which so much stress had
been laid) in connection with the conspiracy was read in Cornish’s presence; that in fact Cornish
was not considered at the time as being in the plot. Such evidence, if not conclusive, ought
to have gone far towards obtaining a verdict of acquittal for the prisoner. This was not the
case, however; the witness was characterised by one of the judges as "very forward," and when
Cornish humbly remonstrated with the treatment his witness was receiving from the bench he
was sharply told to hold his tongue. The jury after a brief consultation brought in a verdict
of guilty, and Cornish had to submit to the indignity of being tied—like a dangerous criminal—whilst
sentence of death was passed upon him and three others who had been tried at the same time.

(M808)

The prisoner was allowed but three clear days before he was hanged at the corner of King Street
and Cheapside, within sight of the Guildhall which he had so often frequented as an alderman
of the city, and on which his head was afterwards placed. He met his end with courage and with
many pious expressions, but to the last maintained his innocence with such vehemence that his
enemies gave out that he had "died in a fit of fury."(1571) The injustice of his sentence was
recognised and his conviction and attainder was afterwards reversed and annulled by parliament
(22 June, 1689).(1572)

(M809)

Of the three others who had been tried with Cornish, two were reprieved (one was afterwards
executed), but the third, Elizabeth Gaunt, was burnt at Tyburn the same day that Cornish suffered
(23 Oct.) for having harboured an outlaw named Burton and assisted him to escape beyond the
law. He had been implicated in the Rye House Plot, but with the aid of Mrs. Gaunt, who lived
in the city, had contrived to avoid capture. In order to save his own skin the wretch did not
hesitate to turn king’s evidence and to sacrifice the life of his benefactress, a woman who
is described as having "spent a great part of her life in acts of charity, visiting the gaols
and looking after the poor." She too died with great fortitude, arranging with her own hands
the straw around her, so as to burn the more speedily.(1573)

(M810)

Parliament began to be alarmed at the favour shown to Catholics, and this alarm was increased
by a report from France that Louis XIV, with whom James was known to be closely allied, and
on whom he depended, like his late brother, for pecuniary support, had revoked the Edict of
Nantes granted by Henry IV in favour of his Protestant subjects. The report was soon confirmed
by the appearance of numbers of French Protestants—refugees from persecution—in England, and
more especially in the city of London. What Louis had done in France James, it was feared,
would carry out in England by means of his standing army commanded by Roman Catholic officers.
Hence the alarm which pervaded not only parliament, but also the city and the nation at large.

(M811)

Hence too it was that when the Houses, which had been adjourned during the campaign in the
West, met on the 9th November,(1574) they remonstrated with him for the favour he had shown
to Catholics in direct contravention of the law. Finding himself unable to bend parliament
to his will, he determined to do without one, and accordingly, after a brief session, it stood
prorogued (20 Nov.),(1575) never to meet again during the present reign.

(M812)

Without a parliament James could act with a free hand. By a piece of chicanery he managed to
get a legal decision acknowledging the dispensing power of the king.(1576) He established an
Ecclesiastical Commission Court, with the infamous Jeffreys at its head, the first act of which
was to suspend the Bishop of London for upholding the Protestant faith. He removed the Earl
of Clarendon (son of the late Chancellor), who had recently been appointed Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland,(1577) and appointed as lord deputy the Earl of Tyrconnel, a Roman Catholic of low
character, who had gained an unenviable notoriety as the "lying Dick Talbot." The country was
over-run with Papists from abroad. All the laws against the exercise of the Roman Catholic
religion were set at defiance. There was no disguise. Mass was publicly celebrated at Whitehall
and Roman Catholic chapels sprang up everywhere, giving rise to no small dissatisfaction and
tumult. The agitation in London was great, but greater in the city, where men had been less
accustomed to the sight of the Romish ceremonial than those who lived in the neighbourhood
of the court. Riots in the city were of frequent occurrence, more especially on Sundays, when
the Roman Catholics were more in evidence than on week days. A Roman Catholic chapel had recently
been erected by the Elector Palatine in Lime Street. An ineffectual attempt had been made by
the mayor and aldermen to stay the work. They were summoned to appear before the king and reprimanded.
The work was accordingly allowed to go on and the chapel was opened. On Sunday, the 18th April
(1686), the priests attached to the chapel were followed by a mob into Cheapside, and matters
would have gone hard with them had not the mayor and aldermen appeared on the scene with a
regiment of trained bands. James again sent for the mayor and told him that if he could not
keep better order in the city he should himself send some "assistance."(1578) Nevertheless
another riot broke out on the following Sunday. A mob entered a Roman Catholic chapel and carried
away a crucifix, crying out they would have no "wooden gods." A cross was set up on the parish
pump and mock obeisance made to it. The priests were insulted, but no violence was offered
them. When the mayor appeared to quell the tumult the crowd affected to disbelieve that his
lordship was in earnest. "What! the lord mayor of our city come to preach up popery! too sure,
it cannot be!" When the trained bands were ordered to disperse the crowd they declared that
in conscience they could not hinder them in their work.(1579)

(M813)

These disturbances were very injurious to the trade of the city, and caused a considerable
fall in the amount of customs paid for merchandise entering the port of London. A regiment
or two of the standing army which James had formed might any day appear in the city. "I shall
not wonder if the Scotch regiment of guards now quartering at Greenwich be quartered in Cheapside
before this week is out," wrote a contemporary on the 27th April.(1580) A month later the army
was encamped at Hounslow, the king himself being also there, ready to send "assistance" to
the city should occasion arise.(1581)

(M814)

For a time James had entertained the hope of obtaining favours for the Catholics with the goodwill
of the Church of England, whilst continuing the persecution of dissenters. Finding this impossible
he determined to make friends of the dissenters, and to include them in a general declaration
of indulgence. Accordingly on the 4th April, 1687, there appeared a Declaration of Indulgence
suspending all laws against Roman Catholics and dissenters alike.(1582)

(M815)

James would willingly have obtained parliamentary sanction for his declaration if he could.
To this end he again took to tampering with corporations throughout the country, in the hope
of securing thereby a parliament favourable to his policy of toleration. Six commissioners
were appointed in November to "regulate" all the corporations of England, by turning out all
who were opposed to the abolition of the penal laws and Test Act and putting in their place
those who favoured it.(1583) In London dispensations were granted to the livery companies relieving
their members from taking the oaths and test, whilst similar dispensations were included in
the royal commissions appointing aldermen. In many of the companies Tories of a too pronounced
character were turned out and their places taken by dissenters.(1584) Everywhere dissenters
were treated with the greatest consideration. Notwithstanding every effort, however, to capture
the constituencies at the next elections, James found public opinion against him to be too
strong, and all thought of summoning a fresh parliament had to be abandoned.

(M816)

In the meanwhile addresses flowed in from various parts of the country thanking the king for
his declaration. Presbyterians, Quakers, Independents, Congregationalists alike sent addresses,
but as yet no address was presented on behalf of the Court of Aldermen—the governing body of
the city, now that the Common Council was in abeyance. That body had to be largely remodelled
before it would consent to present any such address. On Thursday, the 16th June, the infamous
Jeffreys, who had been rewarded with the seals for his work at the Bloody Assizes, appeared
before the Court of Aldermen and declared his majesty’s pleasure that in future that court
should nominate and recommend to the Crown such persons as they thought fit to be aldermen
as vacancies occurred, and that no one so nominated should be exempt from service except for
insufficiency of estate, to be declared on oath. Those who were capable of serving and refused
to serve when nominated by the court were to be fined, and the fines were to be devoted to
the use and benefit of the city’s orphans. The ancient privilege, too, of the mayor drinking
to a future sheriff received the king’s sanction.(1585) Having listened to the lord chancellor’s
message the court resolved to wait upon the king at Windsor on the following Sunday to thank
his majesty "for that and all other his majesties acts of grace to this court and city."(1586)
Both the mayor and the Court of Aldermen lost no time in exercising their privileges, but they
experienced great difficulty in getting any one to serve sheriff or alderman. Fines ran up
apace, until no less than £8,500 had been paid by persons desirous at any cost to be discharged
from filling either of those thankless offices. Many of the aldermen either voluntarily resigned
their gowns or were dismissed from the court because they were unwilling to vote an address
of thanks to James for his declaration.(1587)

(M817)

At length the court was sufficiently packed with dissenters to pass an address to the king
(26 July) thanking him for his declaration, and assuring his majesty of their readiness to
stand by him with their lives and fortunes.(1588) The orphans of the city also voted an address,(1589)
as well they might, seeing the amount of money that the declaration had been the means of bringing
into the orphans’ fund.

(M818) (M819) (M820)

Not every dissenter welcomed the king’s declaration. To many of them it seemed—what the king
intended it to be—only a lever for raising the Roman Catholics. Baxter, to whom friendly overtures
were made by government to win him over, refused to join in any address of thanks for the declaration.
John Howe declared himself an opponent of the dispensing power, and Bunyan declined to enter
into any negotiations on the matter at all.  William Kiffin, on the other hand, an influential
Baptist in the city, succumbed to the threats, if not to the blandishments, of James.(1590)
In addition to possessing spiritual gifts of no mean order, Kiffin was also a man of wealth
and position in the world of commerce. In every way he would prove a valuable ally, if only
he could be won over. Against this, however, there was one great impediment: the recollection
of the judicial murder of his two grandsons, Benjamin and William Hewling, by Jeffreys at the
Bloody Assizes. Fondly imagining that the memory of that foul act could be blotted out and
the stricken heart salved by an increase of wealth or elevation in rank, James sent for him
to court, and after some preliminary remarks touching the royal favour that was being shown
to dissenters, told Kiffin that he had put him down as an alderman in his "new charter," alluding
no doubt to the royal commission of 6th August, in which Kiffin’s name appears as alderman
of Cheap ward in the place of Samuel Dashwood. On hearing this Kiffin replied, "Sir, I am a
very old man,"—he was seventy years of age when he lost his grandchildren—"I have withdrawn
myself from all kind of business for some years past, and am incapable of doing any service
in such an affair to your majesty or the city. Besides, sir," the old man continued, with tears
running down his cheeks, and looking the king steadily in the face, "the death of my grandsons
gave a wound to my heart which is still bleeding, and never will close but in the grave." For
a moment the king was abashed, but quickly recovering himself told Kiffin that he (James) would
find "a balsam for that sore." The old man still held out, until, hearing that legal proceedings
were about to be taken against him, he took counsel’s opinion as to what was best to be done.
He was told that he was running a great risk by refusing to become an alderman, for the judges,
as they then were, might subject him to a penalty of ten, twenty, or thirty thousand pounds,
"even what they pleased." Under such circumstances he consented to be made an alderman, rather
than bring ruin on himself and family. He, however, put off the evil day as long as he could,
and was not sworn into office until the 27th October.(1591)

Kiffin expressed himself as pleased with the reception he met with in his ward, where he was
almost a stranger. But much of the business which the Court of Aldermen was called upon to
execute in those days was distasteful to him. "We had frequently orders from the king" (he
writes) "to send to the several companies to put out great numbers of liverymen out of the
privilege of being liverymen, and others to be put in their rooms; most of which that were
so turned out were Protestants of the Church of England. There has been a list of seven hundred
at a time to be discharged, although no crime laid to their charge." The royal commission which
appointed him an alderman also created him a justice of the peace and a member of the Court
of Lieutenancy, but to use his own words, "I never meddled with either of those places, neither
in any act of power in that court [i.e., Court of Aldermen] touching causes between man and
man, but only such things as concerned the welfare of the city and good of the orphans, whose
distressed condition called for help, although we were able to do little towards it." He was
not called upon to discharge his invidious duties for any great length of time; for after being
in office only nine months he obtained his discharge, to his "very great satisfaction." He
continued to live for another thirteen years, dying on the 29th December, 1701, in his 86th
year, and he was buried in Bunhill Fields—that "God’s acre" which holds the dust of so many
of his fellow non-conformists.

(M821)

In September the king had issued a patent for Sir John Shorter to be lord mayor for the year
ensuing. Shorter was a dissenter—"an Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a mechanic, I
think," wrote Evelyn(1592) of him—and on that account a clause was inserted in his commission
permitting him to have any preacher he might choose.(1593)  His granddaughter was married to
Sir Robert Walpole. He was at one time alderman of Cripplegate ward, but in December, 1682,
he fell foul of Charles II for attending a conventicle at Pinmakers’ Hall, and the Court of
Aldermen received orders to remove him.(1594) He had recently, however (6 Aug., 1687), been
restored to his aldermanry and to his rank of precedence by commission from James,(1595) and
now, by the same usurped authority, he was to become lord mayor. The feast of SS. Simon and
Jude (28 Oct.) happening this year to fall on a Friday, the installation of the new lord mayor,
as well as the banquet to which James and the Papal Nuncio had been invited, was postponed
until the following day. The aldermen agreed to defray the cost of the entertainment out of
their own pockets,(1596) each laying down the sum of £50. Kiffin also sent £50, although he
had not yet been sworn a member of the court; but he afterwards regretted having done so when
he learnt that the Pope’s Nuncio and other priests had been invited as guests.(1597) The day
passed off well. The Goldsmiths’ Company, of which the new lord mayor was a member, made a
particularly brave show. The entire roadway from Charing Cross to the city had been fresh gravelled
that morning, and the king, who was accompanied by the queen, expressed himself as well pleased
with the entertainment afforded him.(1598)

(M822)

The Dissenters now had matters all their own way. The livery companies had become so leavened
with an influx of new members, whose claim for admittance rested chiefly on their antagonism
to the established Church, that most of them now sent in addresses to the king thanking him
for his Declaration of Indulgence. The Barber-Surgeons and the Apothecaries had already done
so; so had the Clothworkers, the Mercers and the Glovers. Their example was now followed by
the Cutlers, the Goldsmiths, the Haberdashers, the Joiners and the Weavers.(1599) The mayor,
who kept his mayoralty at Grocers’ Hall, openly held a conventicle there on Sunday, the 6th
November,(1600) whilst he declined to listen to a sermon by the learned Dr. Stillingfleet in
the Guildhall chapel.(1601) More than this, he would have turned the chapel itself into a conventicle
could he have had his own way.(1602)

(M823)

In the Spring of 1688 James published a second Declaration of Indulgence varying but slightly
from the former one, and ordered it to be read in the churches of London and Westminster on
the 20th and 27th May, and in the country on the 3rd and 10th June. This was more than the
clergy could stand. A meeting of bishops was held at Lambeth for the purpose of drawing up
a petition to the king praying that the clergy might be excused reading an illegal document
in the midst of public service. This petition was signed by Sancroft, the primate, and six
bishops. Although the Bishop of London was not among those who signed the petition—he at the
time being under disability—there is reason for believing that Compton had been taken into
counsel by those who drafted it.(1603) On the petition being presented James pretended the
utmost surprise, and insisted that the presentation of such a petition was "a standard of rebellion."
This took place on Friday preceding the first Sunday (20th May) when the Declaration was to
be read in the London churches. When Sunday arrived people flocked to the churches to hear
what would happen. Only a few of the London clergy attempted to read the Declaration.(1604)
In the country not more than 200 clergy carried out the king’s orders, "and of these some read
it the first Sunday, but changed their minds before the second; others declared in their sermons
that though they obeyed the order they did not approve the Declaration." One minister in particular
told his congregation that though he was obliged to read it they were not obliged to hear it,
and waited until all had left the church before he commenced reading the hateful document.
In other places the congregation took the initiative and rose to go as soon as the minister
commenced reading it.(1605)

(M824)

What followed is well known. On Friday the 8th June the Archbishop of Canterbury and the six
bishops who had signed the petition were summoned before the council and asked if they acknowledged
their respective signatures. They were next required to enter into bond for appearance before
the King’s Bench. This they declined to do, and were thereupon committed to the Tower.(1606)
To have carried them through the streets of the city might have caused a riot; they were therefore
conveyed to the Tower by water, "and all along as they passed the banks of the river were full
of people, who kneeled down and asked their blessing, and with loud shouts expressed their
good wishes for them and their concern in their preservation."(1607) The enthusiasm of the
Londoners did not end here. They continued to flock to the Tower, filling the small chapel
where the bishops attended service to overflowing in order to gaze upon their beloved pastors
and receive their blessing.(1608) After being kept in separate confinement, and allowed to
meet only at meals and in chapel, for ten days, the bishops were allowed to come out on bail.

(M825)

On the 29th June they appeared before the King’s Bench on a charge of publishing a seditious
libel. A technical difficulty presented itself at the outset, but this was got over, and after
a trial of some hours the question of their innocence or guilt was left to a jury drawn, not
from London, but from the county of Middlesex. One of the panel stuck out against the rest,
and wished to bring in a verdict of guilty, but after being locked up through the night he
allowed himself to be persuaded by his fellow-jurymen, and on the morning of the 30th June
a verdict of not guilty was found. Thereupon "there were such shoutings, so long continued,
and as it were echoed into the city, that all people were struck with it."(1609) Bonfires were
lighted, guns discharged and church bells rung, not only in London but throughout the kingdom.

(M826)

The beginning of the end was approaching. Already the troops encamped at Hounslow, on which
James placed so much dependence, showed signs of disaffection. He had hoped that his army would
have overawed London, instead of which the free spirit of London had, as a result of his policy,
entirely captivated his army. So long as the king was in their midst the troops maintained
a respectful demeanour, but as soon as his back was turned they threw off all restraint, and
joined in the general exultation at the late joyful deliverance to the Church of England.(1610)

(M827)

The birth of a prince (10 June), which had recently taken place, served to hasten the crisis.
Those who were willing to have waited patiently for a recurrence to the old order of things
at the king’s death now saw their hopes dashed to the ground. The king’s heir and successor,
brought up, as he undoubtedly would be, in the tenets of his father, promised them little relief.
Even before the birth of the prince overtures had been made to William of Orange to appear
in England at the head of an army. Nevertheless the Court of Aldermen displayed its loyalty
by resolving that the conduits in Cheapside and at the Stocks Market should run with claret
on Thanksgiving-day. The sheriffs were to take the matter in hand, whilst the sum of £50 was
raised by the court to defray the cost, the mayor contributing £10, each of the sheriffs £5,
and the rest of the aldermen the balance between them.(1611) Later on (29 June) the mayor,
aldermen and sheriffs waited upon the infant prince and kissed his hand. The various nurses
were presented by the Chamberlain with the respectable douceur of sixty guineas, whilst ten
guineas were given to the lord chancellor’s messenger who brought the news to the city of the
prince’s birth.(1612)

(M828)

The day that saw the bishops acquitted a letter was despatched, signed by Shrewsbury, Danby,
Compton (the suspended Bishop of London) and others, to the Prince of Orange, again inviting
him to land in England with an armed force, and promising to render him every assistance. After
some hesitation William accepted the invitation, and began to make preparations, both naval
and military, for his descent on England. Towards the close of September news came from Holland
of the vast preparations that were being pushed forward in that country. A fleet of sixty sail
was in readiness, and the prince himself was shortly expected on board. James lost no time
in informing the lord mayor of the state of affairs, and desired that he and the aldermen would
take measures for preserving the city in peace.(1613) On the 28th he issued a proclamation
informing his subjects of the threatened invasion, and calling upon them to lay aside all jealousies
and to unite in defending the country against the foreign enemy.(1614)

(M829)

James saw, when it was too late, that he had over-taxed the patience of his subjects. He was
now ready to make any and every concession. As for the citizens of London, they should have
their charter restored. Accordingly, on Saturday the 6th October Lord Chancellor Jeffreys appeared
before the Court of Aldermen with two separate grants under the great seal, the one appointing
Sir John Chapman to be mayor (in the place of Sir John Eyles(1615)) up to the feast of SS.
Simon and Jude (28 Oct.), with liberty to the citizens in the meantime to elect one of their
own choice to be mayor for the year ensuing; the other, continuing in office Sir Samuel Thompson
and Sir Humphrey Edwin, then sheriffs, until a new election of sheriffs should be made by the
citizens. The newly-appointed mayor and the existing sheriffs thereupon went down into the
Guildhall, accompanied by the lord chancellor, who informed the citizens of the restitution
of their liberties.(1616) The mayor and sheriffs having taken the oaths and subscribed the
declaration prescribed by the Corporation Act, the aldermen returned to their chamber, and
such as had been aldermen at the time of the judgment upon the writ of Quo Warranto and were
then present were forthwith sworn in for the respective wards from which they had been deposed.
The court next proceeded to draw up an address to the king, in which his majesty was assured
that with all duty and faithfulness they would cheerfully and readily discharge the trust reposed
in them to the utmost hazard of their lives and fortunes.(1617) One cannot help noticing how
studiously different the wording of this address is from those previously presented. Not a
word about defending his majesty’s person with their lives and fortunes; these are thenceforth
to be expended in guarding their own liberties! In close-remarked education, of coverage of citizens,

 The council so elected was to be but a provisional one until the
regular election should take place on St. Thomas-day (21 Dec.).(1622) On the 1st December the
new Common Council sat for the first time,(1623) none having met since the 2nd October, 1683.

(M830)

The day that a new Common Council was elected Jeffreys (who was already packing up to be off)
notified that writs were about to be issued for a new parliament. The House was to meet on
the 15th January (1689). James had purposed summoning a parliament for November (1688), and
some of the writs had been actually sent out, but the Dutch preparations so alarmed him that
the writs were recalled.(1624)

(M831)

In the meantime an extraordinary council had been held at Whitehall (20 Oct.) which the mayor
and aldermen of the city had been invited to attend. The object of the meeting was to dissipate
any doubt that had been entertained as to the infant prince being actually the king’s son.
There had been rumours to the contrary, and as the king was about to enter upon a dangerous
enterprise in person, he declared his intention of settling the question beyond all doubt before
leaving. "can they separate me from themselves?" he inquire, and Quicksilver admits that the daemon

"him to travel, and just," is a reply, "i do not serve sheriffs."
Prometheus denies their state be of the himself. This
offer, one need scarcely say, was declined.(1625) The same day proclamation was made for guarding
the sea coast and withdrawing all draft cattle into the interior.(1626)

(M832)

The feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.) falling on Sunday, Sir John Chapman, who had been
re-elected mayor by free choice of the citizens, proceeded to Westminster by water according
to custom on the following Monday, accompanied by the aldermen, and was sworn before the barons
of the exchequer. He returned to Grocers’ Hall and there entertained the lords of the council,
the judges and many of the nobility. Notwithstanding the precautions taken against riot during
the mayor’s absence from the city the mob broke out and sacked and burnt a "mass house" in
Bucklersbury. For this disturbance the mayor and sheriffs were called to account by the king.(1627)

(M833)

On the 5th November the Prince of Orange successfully effected a landing in Torbay. As soon
as the news reached London James again sent for the mayor and aldermen, ordered them to take
care of the city, and, if he should fall in battle, to proclaim the Prince of Wales successor
to the crown.(1628) William proceeded to march upon London. At Exeter he was well received,
but some little time elapsed before the gentry showed any disposition to throw in their lot
with the prince. On the 17th James set out with his army to meet the invader, after receiving
an assurance from the mayor and aldermen that they would take care of the city during his absence.(1629)
He reached Salisbury, but soon found himself deserted by officers and friends. Among the former
was Lord Churchill, afterwards known as the Duke of Marlborough, and the greatest soldier of
the age. Left almost alone, James returned to London, having been absent from the capital less
than ten days. Like his name-sake the Conqueror, William made no haste to reach London, but
advanced by slow marches, putting up at various gentlemen’s houses on the way. It was borne, he tells us,
in memory on 1626 on his true journeys between Frankfort and Strassburg, and on falling a period
when the storm Friederike was fully terrific him. Of the one, Wanderers
who sturmlied, he has been sworn in his Autobiography was the account
which is however given out by the water declined of the poem.

It was deemed advisable to close all the Roman Catholic chapels except the royal chapels and
those belonging to foreign ambassadors.(1630) Another sign of the times was the fact that the
sceptre belonging to the statue of Queen Mary set up in the Royal Exchange had either accidentally
fallen or (as was more probable) had been forcibly struck out of her hand.(1631) On the 7th
December the mayor issued a precept to the aldermen of each ward for a careful search to be
made in the city for all Papists and suspicious persons. He did this because he understood
that the inhabitants of the city were much alarmed at the great resort of Papists to the city
who were believed to be meditating some attack upon London.(1632)

(M835)

The negotiations which had been opened with William were only intended by James to serve the
purpose of giving the latter time to place his wife and child in a place of security before
he himself should seek safety in flight. On the 11th December he attempted to make good his
escape. As soon as it was known that the king had left London a great number of lords, both
spiritual and temporal, came to the Guildhall, as to a place of security, the better to consult
and take measures for the common weal. Having informed the Court of Aldermen of the king’s
flight the lords retired into the "gallery adjoining to ye councell chamber," and there drew
up a Declaration,(1633) containing in effect their resolution to assist the Prince of Orange
in maintaining the religion, the rights and the liberties which had been invaded by Jesuitical
counsels. This was communicated to the Court of Aldermen, who thanked the lords for the favour
shown to the Court. As the occasion was an important one it was deemed advisable to summon
forthwith a Common Council, as well as the law officers of the City, to advise the aldermen
as to what was best to be done.(1634) A Common Council was accordingly held that same day.
Being informed of the state of affairs, the court quickly resolved to follow the example set
by the lords, and themselves to present an address to the prince.(1635) An address was accordingly
prepared, in which, having warmly acknowledged the prince’s zeal for the Protestant religion
and expressed regret at the king’s measures and his recent flight, the citizens implored the
prince’s protection, promising him at the same time a hearty welcome whenever he should repair
to their city. The lieutenancy of the city followed suit the same day with another address,
in which his highness was assured that measures had been taken for preserving the city in peace
until his arrival.(1636) The lords, having finished their business in the city, dined the same
evening with the lord mayor at Grocers’ Hall.(1637)

(M836)

On the 17th a letter from the prince was read before the Common Council. The terms of the letter
are not recorded in the City’s archives, but it probably contained some reference to the peace
of the city, for the council, after preparing an answer to it, forthwith gave orders for the
guards of the trained bands to be increased by three regiments.(1638)

(M837)

The following day (18 Dec.) the prince himself entered London, and the council, having heard
of his arrival, immediately despatched the sheriffs and the common sergeant to learn when his
highness would be pleased to receive a deputation from the city. It was arranged that the aldermen
and their deputies and one or two members of the council of each ward, according to the number
of its representatives, should form the deputation.(1639) The lord mayor (Chapman) being indisposed
was unable to attend. He had recently been seized with a fit of apoplexy whilst trying the
terrible Jeffreys, who had been discovered and apprehended in disguise at Wapping. But Treby,
the recorder, was there, and made a speech on the City’s behalf.(1640)
