After the gleeful Simon had shot the two Indians at once, near Paint Creek town, and had spied
upon the town itself, he and scout Montgomery had stayed while the others hastened back to
Boonesborough.  They were not at all satisfied to have come so far and to have taken only one
scalp.

Now this Simon Butler or Simon Kenton was a dare-devil pure and simple: a youth of roguish
but extremely obstinate spirit.  He had started upon the adventure trail at sixteen, and here
at twenty-three he already had many hair-breadth escapes in his memory and many notches in
his rifle-stock.

First, when he was sixteen he had fallen in love, at his home in Virginia, and had fought a
rough-and-tumble with his man rival, by name William Veach or else Leitchman.  He seemed to
be holding Leitchman pretty even, too--until his rival's friends jumped in and pummeled Simon well.

Lad Simon limped away, bruised and bleeding, scarcely able to walk--for such fights were wild-cat
fights with claws and teeth.  He bided his time; he grew rapidly, and by April, 1771, being
six feet tall at last (the true border height) and strongly muscled, he challenged Leitchman again.

They stepped into the timber, and fought.  It was nip and tuck.  No friends were at hand. 
But Simon was still too young; down he went, under the rain of blows, and Leitchman, taunting
him with the loss of his sweetheart, proceeded to "give him the boots."

Simon lay and took it, saying no word.  His mind was active.  He noted his enemy's long hair,
reaching to the waist--a fashion among the border beaux.  An idea occurred to him.  He grasped
one of the piston-like legs and sank his teeth into it. He could only Richard'ii fairness were authorised,

  Simon recognized
the three white men: Simon Girty himself (his scout-partner at Fort Pitt), James Girty, a brother,
and John Ward--all squaw-men who were aiding the Shawnees against the Americans.

None of them appeared to know him; and before they spoke to him he was put outside, while the
council heard their report and decided what to do with the women and children.

Surely, Simon Butler-Kenton realized that he was in a very nest of trouble.  The council-talk
continued for a long, long time.  It was late in the afternoon before he was hauled inside
again, to hear his fate pronounced.  He had given up hope.  He could expect mercy from the
Girtys least of all.  They had deserted the American service in a huff, and were noted as the
bitterest enemies of everything and everybody connected with it.  Their hearts were hot and red.

He was greeted with a general, savage scowl.  Simon Girty pointed to a dirty blanket spread
upon the floor.

"Sit down."

Simon the victim tottered a moment; the insulting tone angered him. Girty grabbed him by the
shoulder and forced him down.

"How many soldiers are there in Kentucky?"

"I don't know.  I'm only a private and it's not my business to know.  I can tell you the number
of officers and you can judge for yourself."

"Do you know Captain Stuart?"

Captain Stuart was a leader of the Virginia militia, had tried to save the life of Chief Corn-stalk
at the Point Pleasant fort, and had defended settlements against the Shawnees.

"I know him well.  He is an old friend."

"What is your name?"

"Simon Butler."

Girty stared as if paralyzed.  Simon Butler!  This wretched man Simon Butler, the young comrade
whom he had loved when they were scouts together, back "home"!

With a strange choked cry he rushed from his seat and hugged him.

"Butler!  You?  I've got to save you."

He turned upon the astonished warriors, who did not understand.  He made an earnest speech,
in the Shawnee tongue, with many gestures. Simon caught only the drift of it, but Girty the
renegade was arguing for the life of a friend.  He explained that here was a man as dear to
him as a brother.  They had traveled the same trail, slept under the same blanket, lived in
the same house.  He had never asked a favor before.  He had been with them three years and
helped them.  Now he wished only the life of this man, his former brother.

Several of the older chiefs grunted approval.  Simon's heart rose.  But others spoke opposing.
They said that the council already had decided; the Shawnees should not change their minds
like squaws.  Here was a very bad man.  He had taken scalps, had stolen their horses, had flashed
a gun at them when they tried to get their horses back again. He was too bad to be a Shawnee.
He was from Kentucky, and henceforth all Kentuckians were to be killed.  Even Captain Boone
had deceived them.  Besides, people had come to Wakatomica, to see the fun, and ought not to
be disappointed!

Simon's heart fell.

Girty leaped up and spoke again, at length.  He was answered.  The debate lasted for an hour
and a half.  The council proceeded to a vote. The war-club was passed from hand to hand.  Those
who struck the floor with it, voted for death.  Those who merely passed it on, voted for life.
An old man, sitting in the center, kept tally by cutting notches in the two edges of a stick--one
series of notches for the yeas, one series for the nays.

Simon watched intently.  He dared not show any sign of joy, but his heart thrilled to bursting
when he saw that the nays were winning.  The old man announced the result.  Simon Girty turned
to Simon Butler.

"Well, my friend, you are safe.  Come with me."

It was the shortest speech yet, and the best.

He led Simon outside.  No Indian opposed.  He took him to the trader's store and fitted him
with moccasins, leggins, shirt, a handkerchief for his neck and another for his head.  Took
him home; had his own squaw dress the wounds from club and knife and switch.  Made him one
of the family.

For twenty-one days Simon lived in clover.  The Indians all treated him kindly.  He wandered
where he pleased, in the neighborhood.  It seemed too good to be true.

At the end of the blissful three weeks, he and Simon his friend were at Solomon's Town, a short
distance from Wakatomica.  They heard a shrill whoop; an Indian came running from Wakatomica.
The heart of Simon Butler sank again.  He did not like whoops in that tone of voice, and the
Indian was signaling them.

"It's the distress halloo.  We are summoned to the council-house," said Simon Girty.  "We must
go at once."

They and their friend Red Pole, a Shawnee, went to meet the runner.  He shook hands with Red
Pole and Simon Girty, but he refused Simon Butler's hand and scowled upon him.

Matters looked bad once more.  Fortune was playing tricks, still. Matters looked worse in the
council-house.  The place was thronged with chiefs and warriors.  There were a number of strange
chiefs.  Hands were shaken, but not the hand of Simon.  He received only scowls.

A war party of the Shawnees had been defeated on the border; the spirits of their slain required
revenge.  The stranger chiefs gazed upon Simon indignantly.  Why had he not been killed before?
The Shawnee nation were getting childish.  Let him be executed.  The councils had so voted.
Who now wanted him to live?

Simon Girty made another speech.  He was hotly countered, by the stranger chiefs.  They carried
the day.  He again turned to Simon Butler.

"My friend, I think you must die.  But I have persuaded them to burn you at Upper Sandusky,
where there will be many more Indians than here, receiving their presents from the British.
I will ride ahead and see what I can do for you."

He left.  Simon was immediately hustled out by the collar and arms, and led by a rope around
his neck was marched afoot, guarded by horsemen, for the north.

What a sudden change!  First he had been beaten; then he had been painted black, for death.
Then he had been released.  Now he was to be killed.  He had faint hope.  It flickered when
Girty passed him, and saying "I have friends in the next village," continued.  It died completely
when he arrived at the next village, and no Girty was there. His friend Simon had failed, and
had gone back by another trail.

By this time he himself was already in torture.  On the way the march had been interrupted
by an old Indian who was sitting on a log, smoking a pipe and watching his squaw chop wood.
The sight of the roped prisoner enraged him.  He had lost a son, by a white man's rifle.  In
a twinkling he had sprung up, grabbed the ax from the squaw, and at one blow had cut Simon's
arm wellnigh off at the shoulder.

The ax whirled high for a more deadly blow, but another Indian caught at it just in time.

"Shame on you!" he scolded.  "You act like a fool.  This man is for the stake.  Would you cheat
us out of him, when the people ahead are expecting great pleasure?"

Half dead from loss of blood, poor Simon arrived at the village.  It was the town where the
sullen Logan, once the firm friend of the whites, lived.  Here he was eating his heart, with
grief over the wrongs done to him.[1]

Chief Logan the Mingo walked over to Simon, and surveyed him.  Simon did not know who he was;
he may have heard of Simon.

"Well, young man," he said, in good English, "these other young men seem very mad at you."

Own was here weak weapon shake his trader, Tom, give his loss, him

  And it goes without
saying that there was a great ado over them in the Wetzel cabin, which had given them up for lost.

Nine years later Father Wetzel was killed by the Indians.  He and a companion had been down
river in a canoe, hunting and fishing. Neighbors had warned him that this was risky business,
but he only laughed.  Now he and his partner were paddling upstream, along shore, about eight
miles below Wheeling.  From the brush a party of Indians hailed them and ordered them to land.

"What!  Surrender to you, you yaller varmints?" old man Wetzel rapped. "Not whilst we live."

They turned the canoe and paddled fast, but the guns spoke and he received a ball through his
body.  He felt that he was wounded to death.

"Lie down in the bottom," he gasped.  "That'll save you.  I'm gone anyway, but I can get us
out o' range."

He acted as target, while paddling his best.  They made the opposite shore, at the mouth of
Captina Creek, and he died at Baker's Bottom settlement, a short distance above.  He was buried
here.  For some years a stone marked his grave.  It said, only: "J. W., 1787."

At the Wetzel home the Wetzel boys vowed relentless war against all Indians.  Their hatchets
should never be dropped until not a redskin roamed the woods.

Lewis was now twenty-three: a borderman through and through and skilled almost beyond all others.
He was not of the "long" type; instead, he was five feet eight inches; darker in complexion
than his swarthy brothers, pitted with small-pox scars, broad-shouldered, thick in body, arms
and legs, fiery black-eyed, and proud of his deeply black hair that when combed out fell in
rippling waves to his calves.

All the brothers had long hair, black and oiled and curled.  His was the longest; when not
loose it formed a bunch under his fur cap.

He grew to be the most famous of the West Virginia Indian-fighters.  In daring, and in trail-reading,
he won first place.  He practiced reloading his thirty-six-inch barreled, flint-lock patch-and-ball
rifle on the run (no easy job), and by this trick out-witted many Indians who thought that
they had him when his gun had been emptied.  The West Virginians looked upon him as their Daniel
Boone, and their "right arm of defence."

He was credited with twenty-seven scalps, on the West Virginia border, and as many more elsewhere
on the frontier.  His brothers swelled the number to over one hundred.

Jacob reached six feet in height, and a weight of two hundred pounds--a powerful man like Simon
Kenton.  He and John also were celebrated Indian-hunters.  But although Lewis himself once
was out-lawed by the military government for shooting an Indian needlessly, Martin was the
really vindictive killer.  No Indian of any kind, and whether surrendered or not, was safe
from him, his rifle and his tomahawk.

Indian-hunting and Indian-killing was a business with the Wetzels, and the name "Wetzel" carried
terror through the forests.

Strange to say they, like Simon Kenton and other bordermen who scorned danger, lived on to
a round manhood in spite of the chances that they took.  Lewis died in his bed, of a sickness,
near Natchez on the southern Mississippi River, in the summer of 1808, aged forty-four. John
had died, a few years before, at Wheeling, in similar manner. Martin and Jacob also passed
away peacefully.

Such men as the Wetzel brothers were "shock" troops.  They did not occupy a country, but they
broke the enemy's line.  The struggle to keep the settlers out of present Ohio and Indiana
(the Northwest Territory) proved long and bloody.

In western Pennsylvania and northern Ohio the name Captain Samuel Brady ranks with that of
Daniel Boone in Kentucky and Kit Carson in the Far West.  Up the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh
there are Brady's Bend and East Brady, to remind people of his deeds; near Beaver, Pennsylvania,
at the Ohio River below Pittsburgh, there are Brady's Run, Brady's Path and Brady's Hill; in
Portage County, northeastern Ohio, over toward the Pennsylvania line, there are Brady's Leap
and Brady's Lake.  So Captain Samuel Brady left his mark upon the map.

He came of fighting Irish stock.  He was born in Shippensburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1756, during
the French and Indian War.  His father, John Brady, was out upon the battle trail at the time.

When he was nineteen, or in 1775, he joined the volunteers from Pennsylvania, to march for
Boston.  The War of the Revolution was just bursting into flame, and he intended to be in the
thick of it.  The next year, 1776, his father and his younger brother, James, enlisted with
the Pennsylvania troops, also to fight for liberty.

The men of the Brady family did well.  Father Brady was appointed a captain; James Brady was
wounded at the battle of Brandywine, soon after he had enlisted, and had to quit for a time;
Sam was appointed a first lieutenant when he was twenty, and became captain.

Then, in 1778 his brother James was killed by a band of Senecas under Chiefs Bald Eagle and
Corn Planter.  He fought bravely, single-handed, against them all.  They tomahawked him five
times in the head, and scalped him, but he crawled to safety and even used a rifle.  That was
the Brady way.  He told the story, and died.

In the nest year, 1779, old Captain John Brady, the father, was ambushed and murdered, by other
Indians. He stay conscious of a he analyze, in spirit, hope that he was languidly, and that he grew

The principal Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky (where Simon Kenton had been rescued by Pierre
Drouillard the British Indian agent), in central north Ohio, seemed to be the rallying place
for the bloody forays. General Washington could spare no regular troops yet, to campaign on
the Indian trail; so in order to "shake up" the red rascals volunteer militiamen and Rangers
for miles back in southwestern Pennsylvania and northwestern West Virginia and adjacent Kentucky
were summoned to gather, secretly, May 20, 1782, at Mingo Bottom (present Mingo Junction, Ohio)
on the west side of the Ohio River about forty miles up from Fort Pitt.

Three hundred had been called for; four hundred and eighty arrived--mainly Pennsylvanians,
and the bulk of them crack-shot bordermen in moccasins, leggins, fringed buckskin hunting shirts,
armed with the long patch-and-ball rifle, tomahawk and scalping-knife, and mounted upon the
best of their horses.  It was to be an earnest expedition--a stroke at the heart of the Indian
country.  Before leaving home, many of the men had made their wills.

The popular William Crawford was elected commander.  He had been an ensign with Washington
in the General Braddock campaign of the fatal 1755; had been colonel under General Washington
in the Buff-and-Blue Continental Army, and was General Washington's intimate friend: but Lord
Cornwallis, the British general, had surrendered at Yorktown last fall, the War of the Revolution
appeared to be almost over, and he had returned home as a veteran.

The guides were Jonathan Zane of Wheeling (one of the fighting Zanes) and John Slover, another
Virginian.

Much dependence was placed upon John Slover.  When eight years old, or about in 1760, he had
been captured by the Miami Indians and taken to Upper Sandusky town.  He had lived there among
the Miamis and Wyandots, had mingled with the Shawnees, Delawares and Mingo Iroquois, for twelve
years, and they had treated him well.  He rather liked being an Indian. Then during a peace
council at Fort Pitt in 1773 he had met his real kindred again.  They had persuaded him to
be a white man; therefore he had bade his Indian brothers goodby, and had walked away with
his new-found relatives.

He, also, had served in the Revolution, as a sharpshooter.  Now he felt badly at having been
asked to guide the Long Knife column against his old-time Indian friends, and the town that
had sheltered him; it seemed to him not an honorable thing to do.  Still, he was an American
soldier and citizen; there was war between the white and the red, and dreadful deeds had been
done by hatchet and knife, upon his very neighbors.  His duty was plain.  He could not stay
behind or refuse to aid.  Therefore he consented to guide and fight, in the cause of his fellow
settlers and the protection of the women and children.

The surgeon of the column was Dr. John Knight--a small but gritty little man.  Among the Rangers
was James Paull, of West Virginia, a young Buckskin of twenty-two who had left his widowed
mother in order to march to Sandusky.

The column met with such a defeat as had been known but once since the day of Braddock's Field.
For the Indians were ready.  Their spies had reported upon the secret gathering at the old
Mingo town of Mingo Bottom.  To all the villages of the north and even to Detroit the word
traveled that the Long Knives were coming.

Captain Pipe, the old war-chief of the Delawares, and his aide, Chief Wingenund, arrayed two
hundred warriors and marched from the eastward to join the four hundred Wyandots of Chief Half
King and Chief Shaus-sho-to, and defend the Sandusky.  In the south the Shawnees of Black Hoof
and Black Beard and all, prepared.  The Miamis rallied from the west.  The white captains,
Alexander McKee and the Girty brothers, urged the warriors on.  A messenger to the British
father at Detroit brought back promise of reinforcements from there.  The British father was
sending his Butler's Mounted Rangers and three cannon, and the great white captain Matthew
Elliott to command the whole army.

All the long, long way up from the Ohio River the Colonel William Crawford column had seen
only two Indians.  On June 4 they sighted their goal, the old Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky.
It showed not a sign of life.  They marched upon it.  The buildings had been leveled and grass
was growing in the crooked streets.  Some months before, Chief Half King had moved his people
eight miles northward, down the Sandusky.

Guide John Slover had led in vain.  He, also, was mystified.  The volunteers were disappointed;
they wished to turn back.  The council of officers decided upon one more day's march; then
if nothing happened, back they would go and glad to get out of the land alive.

Now he played the Indian.  He tried to leave no trail.  He changed his course for the southeast,
and with a stick bent the grass upright behind him, where he had stepped.  This made his progress
slower, but more sure.  He was getting tired.  If the Indians caught him, he would be an easy
victim.  However, he had no mind to be caught.

Once he was obliged to sit down, sick.  He vomited, and this eased him, so he could go on again.
His legs and feet were full of nettles and thorns; the gnats and mosquitoes pestered him horribly,
for his piece of blanketing did not cover him.  He fought them with a leafy branch, and threshing
about him, he toiled ahead, cleverly using his crooked stick to conceal his trail.

On the third day, after a sleepless night, he ate a few wild raspberries.  He was growing very
weak, and every inch of him throbbed and smarted and stung.  But he struck another river. 
It was the Muskingum, in eastern Ohio.  He found a place only two hundred yards wide, and swam
across.  The next day he captured two small crawfish and ate them.  The next night he sighted
Wheeling, on the other side of the Ohio.

In the morning he yelled and waved from the bank.  A man, opposite, saw him, and ventured part
way over in a canoe.  The man was afraid.

"Who are you?  Who do you aim to be?"

"I am John Slover.  Take me to Fort Henry."

"You're an Injun.  You're no John Slover.  He's dead.  I've a notion to shoot you, myself."

"I'm Slover.  I am Slover.  I've escaped from the Shawnees.  I'll name you some of the officers
who were with Crawford."

So he did.  The man took him into the canoe.  He was saved.  In five days he had eaten only
a handful of raspberries and two raw crawfish; in five nights he had not slept a wink; in four
days and nights he had traveled across country, by horse and foot, naked except for the piece
of blanketing, for a distance of about two hundred miles.  He was the true never-say-die kind,
and lived for many a year yet, to tell of his adventures and to put them upon paper.

James Paull had reached home before him, and before Doctor Knight also. James was only twenty-two,
but he was an old hand at Indian fighting and at scouting.  And he was a lad of great spirit,
as will now be shown.

When the Indians had fired into the party and then had called upon them to surrender, he had
been the one to dodge and run.  His foot was very lame from a burn.  During the battle his
mess had baked bread by spreading the dough upon the back of a spade, scout fashion.  Somebody
had tossed the hot spade aside, and he had stepped upon it with his bare foot.  The burn was
a bad one; during the retreat his foot got worse and he could scarcely walk on it.

But now with two Indians chasing him, he paid no attention to his foot. He out-ran them, leaped
down the steep bank of a creek, and in landing tore all the skin from his blistered sole. 
He paid attention to it then.  Had to!  A man with a flayed foot cannot do much, in the brush.

Luckily for him, the two Indians gave him up.  He halted long enough to bind his raw foot with
a piece of his trousers.  He could not travel fast, but he used his wits.  He knew all the
tricks of the trail.  He hobbled along fallen logs, so as to leave no marks.  He back-tracked,
in a circle, to cross his own trail and see if he was being followed. He painfully shinned
up trees, wormed out to the end of a branch, and dropped as far beyond his trail as he might,
so as to break it.  This would throw off the dogs, if dogs were used; yes, and it would fool
the Indians, too.

That night he slept in a hollow log.  By morning his foot had swollen to the size of a bucket.
He suffered torment.  He had no food with him and was afraid to fire his gun.  So this day
he ate only a few berries.

To-night he slept like a bear, on a bed of leaves in a crack in a rock. In the morning he sighted
a deer.  What with his pain and his hunger he was desperate.  He shot the deer, cut it open
with his gun-flint, and chewed at the bloody flesh.

This evening he came to an old Indian camp.  Several empty whiskey-kegs were lying around.
That gave him an idea.  He could have a fire, to cook with.  By building the fire underneath
a keg, after dark, there would be no light, and the smoke could not be seen.  He tried that,
and it worked.  After he had cooked and eaten, he slept in the smoke, which kept the mosquitoes
off.  Assuredly, young James Paull knew how to take care of himself.

In two days more he reached the Ohio River above Wheeling.  On account of his foot and his
gun he could not swim it.  No matter. [550] Husbandman (),. 69. [551] the;, fur,. [552] agricultural,. 5.

A brave voice answered Simon Girty.

"You lie.  Go back to your Injuns before a bullet pierces your coward heart."

"Who says I lie?" Girty demanded, with a show of being much hurt.  "Do you know my name, sir?
I am Simon Girty."

Aaron Reynolds replied to him.  He was a spirited young man, and had noticed that some of his
companions were sobered by the word "cannon."

"We know you very well.  I have another worthless dog to which I've given the same name--Simon
Girty, because he looks like you.  If you have either cannon or reinforcements, or both, fetch
'em along.  But if you or any of your naked rascals succeed in finding your way into this fort
we're ready for you.  We'd despise to use guns on you.  We have bundles of switches waiting,
and we'll switch you out again.  As for your reinforcements, there are plenty now coming to
our aid likewise. I'll have you know that more are to follow those already here.  The whole
country is arming; and if you and your gang of murderers linger twenty-four hours longer, your
scalps will be drying in the sun on the roofs of these cabins."

Simon Girty made a show of bristling, indignant.

"I spoke to you out of humanity.  You answer with insult and the tongue of a boy.  Your blood
is on your own heads.  I grieve at your fate. To-morrow morning you will all be dead."

He crawled back again.  But, cheering, the garrison took heart at the bold words of Aaron Reynolds.

The night passed.  In the morning the landscape smiled again.  A few camp-fires idly smoked.
That was all.  Not an Indian remained.  The whole savage army had gone.  They were uncertain
just what place to attack first, and finally had almost decided not to attack any place.

But runners came to them, with the news that after the withdrawal from Bryant's the Kentucky
column had ambushed a Long Knife army including Daniel Boone men, at the lucky Blue Licks,
and defeated it badly.  This was true indeed.  The victors were homeward bound laden with scalps
and booty.  There was much excitement.

A vote of the chiefs determined that the march should be continued, for Wheeling.  Simon Girty
and several others joined.  The column numbered three hundred Indians, and fifty "Queen's Rangers"
sent by the British father from Detroit.  All were under Captain Pratt, of the Rangers, but
Simon Girty was head chief.  They set onward, through the forest, to the Ohio River.

This was the first week in September, 1782.  Scout John Lynn, who was watching the trails in
the Indian country northwest of the Ohio, saw them.  They seemed in a hurry.  At full speed
he made for Wheeling, to give the alarm.  He swam the river, and arrived with the word just
in time.  The settlers, excepting those of the Ebenezer Zane cabin, flocked into Fort Henry.
While they were still very busy, getting ready, in daylight of September 11, the enemy appeared,
strong in savage array and flying their flag.

It was not quite a surprise, although nearly so.  The fort contained about twenty men and boys
who could handle a rifle, and the same number of women and girls and little children.  Before
dawn Captain Boggs, the fort commander, had dashed away, to get aid.  They hoped that he had
escaped.  Colonel Silas Zane had been elected in his place.  Captain John Sullivan, in a dug-out
boat from Fort Pitt, above, loaded with cannon-balls for Louisville, below, had scarcely landed,
on a stop-over, and barely made into the fort, wounded.  The small garrison were glad to have
him.  He was an experienced Indian-fighter.

Colonel Ebenezer Zane had grown tired of seeing his house burned.  He had declared that never
again would he abandon it and take to the fort. It had been rebuilt, on its same site only
forty yards north of the fort wall; had been made "Indian proof," and was well under the cover
of the fort rifle-fire.

This time, here he stayed.  With him there were Andrew Scott, George Green, his own wife Elizabeth
McColloch Zane, her sister Miss McColloch, his sister Elizabeth, her friend Molly Scott, and
the slaves Sam and wife Kate.  That summed three white men and one black man; four white women
and one black woman.  They were going to hold the cabin in spite of "all the copper skins from
Wheeling to Sandusky." Mister been evidently. Sojourn (1854) few River was yelling off Element. They eat

Little Fat Bear nodded.

"We'll plan and watch sharp.  If one goes, all'll have to go, though. No lone trail."

"Of course.  We won't desert each other."

"But we've got to wait for a clear field.  It's a pesky long way home."

"That's so.  Just the same, we can make it if we have a good start."

They told the other boys, and they all lay low, waiting and scheming.

"We're going fishing to-morrow," finally announced Buck Elk, to Fat Bear.  "Want to?"  And
he winked.

"Who!"

"All of us.  Old White Eagle and Singing Bird are going with us, to clean the fish.  But that
doesn't matter."

They were the old father and mother who lived in the same family with Buck Elk.

"Time's getting awful short," Fat Bear mused.  "But maybe we can try something."

With wrinkled White Eagle and Singing Bird scuttling close behind, they went fishing in the
river below the village.  They had not said it to each other, but they hoped never to come
back.  They must make a break for liberty soon.  The warriors might return within a week. 
The forest beckoned close at hand.  And southward, far, far southward, their real home called
to them.  They had been gone almost eight months, but it felt like an age.

"To-night, huh?" murmured Buck Elk, as he and Little Fat Bear fished together, and the two
old Indians drowsed in the shade, or wove baskets of reeds.

"How?"

"Light out from camp while they're asleep.  May not get another chance. That's why I told 'em
we'd like to stay all night, so as to get plenty fish."

"They'll signal help and trail us.  Some of those old men can travel heap fast."

"So can we.  We'll have a head start, and I don't believe there's anybody in the village who
can catch us."

"All right.  They can't do any more than beat us if they do catch us. We'll tell the other
fellows."

They sidled along, until they could tell their partners.

"I'll go," Fat Bear's spunky brother agreed at once.  "If they try to catch us we'll fight
'em off with clubs and rocks.  Who's afraid of the old men?  We'll make their tongues hang out."

"I'll go, you bet," agreed the fourth, also.  "My folks need me.  I'm sick of playing Injun."

"Well, we'll all lie down to sleep; and in the middle of the night I'll wake you up," proposed
Buck Elk.

"Sure?"

"Sure.  Now don't let's talk any more."

At dark the camp went to bed.  The two old Indians were sound sleepers. About midnight Buck
Elk softly turned; he had not slept a wink.  He nudged the next boy, the next boy nudged the
next, and the nudge was passed on.  They softly slipped, one after another, from their blankets.
The two old Indians never stirred.  In the star-light the four hastily grabbed what food they
could; and leaving White Eagle and Singing Bird lying there they tiptoed away, on their silent
moccasins, into the forest.

Fat Bear led.  He was a good woodsman.  Soon they ran; and they ran and walked fast until daylight,
traveling with their backs to the North Star.  Then the sun guided them, until about noon,
when they had to stop and rest.

"How far, you think?" panted the fourth boy.

"Twenty-five miles, I guess.  We'd better cover our trail and hide. Come on.  Follow me," bade
crafty Fat Bear.

They stepped on rocks and logs, swung from tree to tree, and dropped down among bushes.  That
was an anxious afternoon.  One kept watch while the others slept.  They took turns watching
and listening.  They heard not a sound of the pursuit.  Except for the birds and squirrels
the forest was quiet.  Their hearts beat hopefully.  But of course tottering old men on the
trail was a different matter from that of swift, crafty warriors.

In the dusk they started on again, to travel all night.  After this they traveled by night
and slept by day.  That was the proper way. They knew how to do, as well as men.  They trudged
down hill and up, scrambled through ravines, crossed brush and forest and swamps, they waded
and swam, they ate the ripe berries and nuts of the October crop, managed to kill a squirrel
and rabbit, now and again, with a rock or a club; their buckskin clothes and moccasins were
worn to tatters, but they slept warm in sunny nooks: and all the nights they were pushing steadily
on southward for the Ohio River and Louisville.

A journey like this, of over two hundred miles afoot, making their own trail, avoiding the
Indian villages and hunters and out-pacing the pursuit, and living off the country, getting
food by their wits, no boys ever had achieved before. 

Do it was cut out at when a rock, and from what the summit passed of a guard-house. The flight of
steps was dammed about the hundred paces had similarly through the present Treppe. Together the fortified
Treppe should be northward present.  They
could see people gazing; the people saw them.

"They think us Injuns," Fat Bear gasped, at last.  "Blame it, guess we do look some like Injuns,
in our rigs."

"Shucks!  How'll we get over?  We can't swim."

"And Injuns are on our trail.  You know we sighted smoke last evening. We don't want to be
caught here."

"We'll go up above the rapids and make a raft.  Quick!  We can manage with this knife."

They hurried.  They went up the shore about six miles, and worked hard gathering logs, and
cutting brush and vines with their one knife.  They feared that they'd hear the Indians any
moment.  The warriors were hot after them.  Whew!  And there was home, just across!

The raft, when finished, did not amount to much.

"It won't hold all of us," puffed Fat Bear.  "You get on.  I'm the heaviest.  I'm the best
swimmer, too.  You-all paddle, and I'll swim alongside."

They tumbled aboard, with branches for oars.  Little Fat Bear shoved off and began to swim
and push.  They had no time to spare--

"Listen!"

Shrill whoops sounded.  The Miamis were on the fresh trail.

"Hurry!"

Fat Bear kicked and pushed mightily; the others dug with their boughs. The clumsy raft moved
slowly, and was carried down stream by the current.  Would they never get away from shore!
Would the Miamis swim after them, or shoot!  They made a good target.

"Look!  Somebody's coming to meet us!"

That was so.  From the opposite shore a boat--two boats had put out. The raft was drifting
badly, but the danger shore gradually receded, the rescue boats neared, and the home shore
grew plainer.  Swimming, Little Fat Bear was getting blue around the mouth, his face was pale
and pinched.  The November water had chilled him to the bone.

"Can you keep going?"

"Yes, I'm all right.  You keep paddling."

"There they are!"

The Miamis had burst out upon the shore behind.  They yelled furiously, and shook their fists--but
they yelled and threatened in vain.  Now they dared not follow farther.  The boats from the
Kentucky shore took the paddlers off the raft; dragged Little Fat Bear from the cold water.
His teeth chattered.  He could not manage himself.  He had not been taken out any too soon.

"Who are you, anyhow!  White boys?  Where from?"

"We're the boys that the Miamis stole from the Pope settlement last February--all except Billy
Wells.  He's with 'em still."

"What!  How'd you get away?  Your folks had give you up.  I declare! Made off alone, did you!"

"Clear from the Little Calumet River.  Been three weeks."

"Whoopee!  Think o' that!  Guess we'd better take you down to Louisville, soon as we can. 
Colonel Pope's moved into town, 'count o' Injuns.  He'll be powerful glad to see you, and so
will your other folks."

And that proved true.  Colonel Pope met them at the landing.  Little Fat Bear was carried ashore,
to be rubbed and dosed.  And from this time on for many a week there certainly were four boy
heroes in the Louisville district, with "tall" stories to be told over and over again.

Sometimes they wondered how William Wells, "Black Snake," was getting along; but they knew
that he was all right.

[1] See chapter on "Little Turtle of the Miamis," in "Boys' Book of Indian Warriors."  This
opened the way for the white settlers. They crossed the Ohio and spread westward through southern
Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, to the Mississippi River.

But the Indians clung to their old hopes that a portion at least of their lands between the
Great Lakes and the Ohio would be left to them. In the beginning of the new century, 1800,
there arose among the restless Shawnees a medicine-man styled the Prophet and the Open Door.
He aimed to band all the Indians of north, south, east and far west into a vast league that,
working like one nation, should some day rule the country.  His messengers traveled widely,
bearing his instructions. He asserted that he spoke directly from the Great Spirit.

His brother, Tecumseh or Shooting Star, aided him.  Open Door counseled peace until the Indians
had grown strong by right living.  Shooting Star planned for war, as soon as the league had
been formed.  The United States Government knew the schemes of both, and tried to stop the
work.  The two brothers refused to obey.  Governor William Henry Harrison, of Indiana Territory,
struck first.

He marched from Vincennes and destroyed the town of the Prophet.  The second war with Great
Britain, the War of 1812, was about to break, and Tecumseh went to Canada and joined the British.[1]

A great many Indians enlisted under their red general, Tecumseh.  The Potawatomis, Miamis,

  He heard nothing.  He
had faint memory of two companions--knew their names, or thought that he did; but where were
they?  The camp-fire ashes were cold; no breakfast smoke arose.  He saw no packs, no bedding;
the bones of the she-bear were scattered and white and dry.

He called feebly.

"Tom!  Jim!  Hello!  Whar be ye?"

Nobody answered.  He tried to sit up; looked for his rifle, felt for his shot-pouch and powder-horn.
His two nurses were gone; so were his gun, horn, pouch that held his knife and flint and steel.
He had been abandoned; and such a blaze of wrath surged through him that he determined now
to live if only to trail those fellows and kill them.

Yes, by thunder, he'd crawl clear to Fort Henry at the Yellowstone and shoot the two in their
tracks!

He was too weak to sit or stand, but he managed to draw himself along and find a spring.  There
he lay, day and night, picking the fruit from the low wild-cherry and buffalo-berry bushes
as far as he might reach, and dozing and bathing his wounds; and he got stronger.  The tide
of life crept higher and higher.  Trapper Hugh knew that he was going to live.  But he was
scarred redly from head to foot, had lost part of his whiskers and part of his hair; was peeled
to the bone, in places.  What a face he had, although he could not see it!

In about ten days he was ready to travel.  The nearest trading-post that he knew of was fully
one hundred miles southeast, on the Missouri. That looked like a long, long distance for a
man who could not walk straight and had not even a knife.  But he was bound to go, get patched
up, and find those two villains who had abandoned him--who had left him as dead when he wasn't
dead at all!

He managed to find roots, and more berries.  At last, on his staggering, slow way, he sighted
a late buffalo-calf surrounded by wolves.  The wolves killed the calf.  He waited until they
had dulled their appetites; then waving his arms and shouting he staggered in upon them.  He
was enough to put almost anything to flight.  The wolves dropped their bushy tails and slunk
off; and Hugh Glass thankfully "chawed" the raw, warm meat.

He stayed here a short time.  He went on, stronger.  He came to a deserted Indian village.
A few Indian dogs were prowling around.  He was very hungry again.  He spent two days in coaxing
the dogs to him, in order to get his hands upon one.  Then he killed it and partly ate it.
Living thus, by his wits, like a wild animal or a wild man, he arrived at the trading post
near the mouth of the Teton or Mad River, central South Dakota.

But he did not stay long--not even to get patched up.  A party of trappers arrived, in a boat
from down-river; they were going above, to the Yellowstone--the very spot for which he hankered
and where his revenge waited.  He embarked.  The Arikaras ambushed the boat and killed all
the party except Hugh Glass.

They did not get the scalp of old Hugh; no, indeed.  He bore a charmed life.  He had left the
boat, the day before, to make a short cut to Fort Tilton, which lay around a bend.  The Arikaras
only chased him into the arms of two Mandans; the Mandans took him into Fort Tilton--and that
same night, such was his hurry, he set out alone again, on foot, for the Yellowstone and the
Andrew Henry fort at the mouth of the Big Horn in Crow and the Blackfoot country.

He did not fear; he believed that nothing could kill him.  Nothing had been able to kill him,
yet!  Thirty-eight days later, or near the close of October, Trapper Glass strode to the gate
of the Henry fort at the mouth of the Big Horn, up the Yellowstone.

The sentry stared, agape.

"Who are you?"

"How, yoreself, young feller.  Whoopee!  Tell 'em hyar's old Hugh Glass, who war et by a grizzly
b'ar an' is slick as a peeled onion; an' he wants his gun an' fixin's.  Whar's the rascals
that stole all my plunder?"

Hugh Glass!  A miracle!  But he it was.

"We thought you were dead and buried, man!"

"Wall, I ain't, not by a jugful.  An' I wants my plunder an' the scalps o' them two villains."

"They aren't here.  They're down at Atkinson."

What?  Fort Atkinson was the Council Bluffs, on the lower Missouri one thousand miles away.

"I'll git 'em yit," vowed old Hugh.  "If I'd only have knowed!  I warn't very fur from Atkinson."

In February he started for Atkinson, with four other men.  They traveled across country, through
central Wyoming, and struck the Platte; paddled down the Platte in hide boats that they made--and
ran right into the Arikaras.  By night-fall old Hugh found himself again alone; he had lost
all four of his comrades (two had been killed before his eyes), and most of his new outfit.
But, he said:

"I felt quite rich when I found my knife and steel in my shot pouch. These little fixin's make
a man feel right peart when he is three or four hundred miles away from anybody or anywhere--all
alone among the painters (panthers) and the wild varmints."

Young Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike first explored it, sent out by the commander-in-chief
of the army, in 1806, while Lewis and Clark were still homeward bound from the other direction.
He traveled up the Arkansas River and into the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, and landed as a
prisoner in Santa Fe of New Mexico.

The news that he brought back, of New Mexico and the way to get there (an easier way than his
own round-about tour) encouraged the merchants and capitalists of St. Louis to hope that a
trading route, back and forth, might be opened with Mexico.  Calico, cotton, shoes, tobacco,
trinkets and the like were to be sold for gold and silver, or exchanged for buffalo-robes,
beaver-furs, blankets, and wool--all at one hundred per cent, profit over the original cost. A week
later he had entered upon advance. You shall not fight in the John

Fort Leavenworth, up the Missouri, had been located two years before. Troops were ordered from
there, to join the caravan.  They were four companies of the Sixth United States Infantry commanded
by Captain (brevet Major) Bennet Riley, after whom Fort Riley of Kansas is named. Major Riley
had fought as a young officer in the War of 1812.  He had just gained his brevet of major for
having served as captain for ten years.  Promotion was very slow.

The caravan owners and its hunters and adventurers were glad to see the sturdy infantry.  Infantry
is poor stuff with which to catch Indians quickly; cavalry was more used, in a chase: but after
a time the Indians grew to fear the infantry more than the cavalry.

"Pony soldiers run; walk-a-heaps no can run, must fight," they said.

So while the caravan might have preferred dragoons or mounted riflemen, to scour on either
side and ride in front and rear, it must have taken comfort in the presence of the plodding
solid "walk-a-heaps," the unbeatable dough-boys.
