She sighed deeply as she said this.  Mother Agnes tried to turn her thoughts away by talking
cheerfully on other subjects for a time, and made Kate tell all she knew of the little girl
in the next bed.

"I shall come up again to town in a day or two, to see you," Mother Agnes said.

"Will you?" said Kate.  "Thank you.  I did not think you would have cared."

"I do care for you," said Mother Agnes, with her eyes full of tears; "but Kate, there is someone
who cares more."

"I don't believe He cares," said Kate sadly.  "I don't see why He should care for me.  I know
it's all in the Bible; but that was written many hundred years ago.  Please forgive me, ma'am,
for speaking so.  I don't wish to be rude, but I really can't believe it."

Just at that moment the patients' tea was carried in, so that no further talk was possible.
Mother Agnes, with an aching heart, said good-bye to Kate, and hurried off to catch her train.

Next day there was a consultation, for Kate was not doing well; and the doctors broke to her
the news that she would have to lose her leg.  It did not seem to distress her in the least.
She took it quite quietly; but a passion of sobs broke from the next little bed.

"O doctor! doctor!" said a child's voice; "don't go and hurt dear Kate so."

"Don't be frightened about it," said Kate.  "I shall be moved into another room, and you will
know nothing about it till it is all over."

"I am not frightened," said the child; "but oh, sirs, if somebody's leg must be cut off, please,
please let it be my leg instead of Kate's." Frances in her eagerness had forgotten her own
pain; and had raised herself in bed, and stretched out her arm towards the doctors.

The elder of the two men came toward her, and bent over her.  "My dear child," he said, "you
are doing very well; there is no need to cut off your leg.  And try not to distress yourself
about your friend, for only what is wisest and best is being done for her."

"I will try and be good, and not mind so much, please sir," said Frances; and then she hid
her face in the pillow, and tried to choke down her sobs.

The doctors moved away at last, and Kate turned a pair of wondering eyes upon Frances as she said:

"What made you wish to lose your leg instead?"

"Only Kate, because I love you more than I could tell any one.  And if you must lose your leg,
please God, I will comfort you for it as much as ever I can."

"Thank you, dear," said Kate, very much touched,--and after that she relapsed into silence.

Easter fell very late that year.  Good Friday was kept in the hospital after Kate had lost
her leg.  There was a service in the ward, and moreover, the nurse came and sat by Kate's side,
and read to her the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah.

"She doesn't seem to take much notice of reading," the nurse said later to Mother Agnes, who
had come up again to see Kate.  They little knew that it was the first "notice" that Kate had
ever taken of anything in the Bible.

Kate would not talk to-day to Mother Agnes.  She answered gently, but shortly, and could not
be drawn into conversation.  One of her old fits of reserve seemed to have taken hold of her.

Mother Agnes was going away, deeply disappointed, when the nurse told her the story of little
Frances wishing to lose her leg for Kate's sake.  And also, how the children had grown to love
each other; and what a dear child Frances was, and how she talked to Kate of everything that
is good.

And then Mother Agnes was comforted, for she saw that all she had to do was to stand aside,
and let a little child do the work.  And as she walked along the Thames Embankment in the glory
of the setting sun, it came into her mind how Christ had taken all that was sweetest on earth,
the love and trust of little children, the love of the father for the child, of the shepherd
for the sheep, and made earthly love the stepping-stone to raise us into the thought of the
possibility of that greater Love outside ourselves.

The next time she came to the hospital, Kate had much to ask her about the Orphanage.  They
talked pleasantly for a short time; and then, after a pause Kate said: "Mother Agnes, something
is frightening me."

"What is it, Kate?"

Another pause--so long that it seemed as if Kate did not mean to speak again--and then she
said: "The love of God frightens me."

"But, Kate, that was meant to be the greatest joy and comfort of our lives."

"It is always there," said Kate, earnestly, "burning into me so that I cannot forget it.  It
is much worse to bear than the pain.  Indeed, I cannot bear it, it is almost intolerable. 
Night and day, I can never, never forget it.  And oh, Mother Agnes, if I had killed my own
little Frances, it would not have given me the trouble it does to think of the things I have
done against Jesus Christ."

Kate's words, her face, and her whole manner awed Mother Agnes so much that she could not speak
for some moments.  And then she talked to Kate for long--gently and tenderly and more plainly
than she had ever done before.  Kate said good-bye to her with eyes that were full of tears.

That night, before she went to sleep, Frances said:

"Kate, does what you spoke of still burn into you?"

Kate was startled, for she did not think that Frances had heard the half-whispered conversation.

"Yes," she said, "it is there just the same.  I can scarcely bear it! What can I do?"

"I don't know what you can do," said Frances, "except that you are bound to speak to Him about it."

Kate turned on her pillow with a half sob, and said no more.

CHAPTER IV.

IN A THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE.

"Kate--I can't sing any more--I'm just tired out with happiness."

"Cuddle up against me, darling, and try and go to sleep then."

"Then, dear Kate," said Frances, earnestly, "will you promise to tell me all about the next
stations, and the green fields, and the sheep, and the cows, and the people hay-making, and
the dear little white houses.  And I will dream about the sea.  Oh, I am so glad that you and
I are going to the sea."

A look of great compassion came into Violet's face as these words were said.  She only answered
quietly: "Shall I tell you a true story?  A lady one evening who was walking over a bridge
in London, saw a poor man leaning over a parapet, and he had such a sad look in his face that
she felt sure he meant to drown himself.  She didn't like to speak to him; but, as she passed
by, she said these words out loud, 'There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the
city of God.'  And long after they met, and he recognised her and said, 'You saved my life,'
and told her that that night he had had the fullest intention of drowning himself.  I think
her words had made him suddenly remember another city besides London, and another river besides
the dark, gloomy Thames rolling away beneath his feet."

She waited a moment to see if Kate had taken in the little story, and what effect it was having
upon her.  Kate's head was bent down, and she had fast hold of little Frances' hand.

"Like enough the city and the river made him think of Christ," she said.  "I couldn't drown
myself now, Miss,--not if it was ever so,--for His sake I couldn't.  And if I had to be miserable
all the rest of my life, it seems to me it would be worth while to have lived to have known
the love of Christ even for five minutes."

"And it isn't only for five minutes," said Violet, in a low voice, her eyes glowing, "but for
ever and for ever.  This is only the beginning."

They were silent for some moments, and then Violet's gentle questions called out much of the
history of Kate's sad life.  They were learning from each other, those two girls.  Kate learned
what sympathy may do, and a deep desire to minister to others sprang up within her.  Violet
learned how dull and sad and surrounded with dangers the lives of many girls in our great cities
are, and the knowledge gave rise to new prayers and plans and work in her future life.

A cathedral town came in sight.  Violet, starting up, woke old Nanny, and then began quickly
putting together books and cloaks.  Only a few minutes more, and she was standing with outstretched
hand at the door of the railway carriage.

"Good-bye, good-bye," she said.  "Do write and tell me how you and little Frances like the
sea-side.  I hope it will do you good," and she was gone.  Kate and Frances watched with eager
eyes till the tall graceful figure of the girl and the bent figure of the old woman were lost
to sight in the crowded station.

"Do you think we shall ever see her again?" said little Frances.

"Perhaps," said Kate, "we shall have to wait till we reach the Golden City."

CHAPTER V.

BY THE SEA.

Two little girls were lying out, in two long chairs, by the sea-shore. The younger one was
knitting, and, as she knitted, talking and laughing, and often looking up to rest her eyes
lovingly on the sea. Her lap was covered with shells and sea-weed, brought to her by some pale-faced
fellow-patients who were wandering about the shore.

Mother Agnes had sent both Kate and Frances to a Convalescent Home by the sea, and their delight
over this their first sea-side visit was untold.  From early morning, when they woke to find
themselves in a pink room, in beds with white dimity curtains printed with pink rose-buds,
and the smell of the sea coming in at the open window, till the last light had faded away in
the long summer evenings, their days were one continued dream of delight.

Kate's face was growing sunburnt and warm in colouring.  Her eyes had a soft, surprised look
in them, as if she were suddenly waking up to a whole world of unsuspected wonders in heaven
and on earth.  There was a gladness about her, like the gladness of a little child who has
been turned out of a dull, close room into a field of cowslips.  She and Frances never tired
of each other's company; and Kate, for the first time in her life, was guilty of laughing and
talking nonsense from sheer lightheartedness.

And so the days sped by, till Kate began to have a sort of wish to see the Orphanage again,
and a feeling that after all the pain might be conquered, and life there be brightest and best.

And, oddly enough, as she and Frances were talking about it one morning, who should make her
appearance but Mother Agnes herself, who spoke about Kate's return as if it had been all settled
long ago; and then told Frances to her great surprise that she too was to become an inmate
of the Orphanage.  The poor aunt had had losses, the little shop was given up, and she could
no longer provide for Frances, and had entreated Mother Agnes to get the child admitted.  And
Frances' great love for Kate helped her over the trouble of changing her old home for a new one.

When the two invalids arrived at the Orphanage, they found a great "Welcome" arranged in daisies
over the door.  Kate was feasted like the prodigal son on his return, and no one thought of
reproaching her for having run away.  And Kate returned the love and kindness she met with
fully and joyously, for now she had entered into that mysterious rest and sweetness existing
somewhere at the heart of things, of which so much is written, but which so few set themselves
with earnest purpose to find.

It was a surprise to every one, except perhaps to Mother Agnes, who understood the girl's mind,
when Kate began to write little poems, and to receive sundry little sums of money from different
magazines for them.  Kate's first wish, of course, was to give back the value of the Orphanage
dress in which she had run away; and then Mother Agnes started a money-box, into which all
the earnings were put in the hope that some day enough would be found in it to buy Kate a cork
leg. "That day, Kate," said she, "may yet be a long way off.  But, meanwhile, dear child, you
will remain here, and complete your education, and by-and-by I hope we shall see you mistress
of a village school."

The money-box was placed in the Orphanage schoolroom, and the children dropped their pennies
in, and sometimes strangers who came to visit the Orphanage were told how Kate had lost her
leg, and added something to the fund.  And, in course of time, the box got so full that Mother
Agnes, for prudence sake, would carry it to her own room to lock it up at night.

      *      *      *      *      *      *

Another frosty Christmas, but it was night now, and all the glories of a starlit sky could
be seen from the corridor window, on the broad ledge of which Kate and Frances sat.  The years
that had passed had changed them much.  Kate had a quiet power about her that could be more
felt than expressed in words.  Her face, quaint and clever, was lighted up by a singularly
sweet smile; and nothing reminded one of the old Kate except the large, pathetic eyes.  She
was Mother Agnes's right hand with the little ones.  Her way of managing them was so winning
that she seldom or never caused vexation; and she brought sympathy, imagination, and judgment
to bear in her work amongst them.

Frances had grown very pretty; she had golden brown hair, and blue eyes that were always laughing;
and her face was not only beautiful in form and colour, but sensitive and refined.  She had
quite recovered her accident; was fleet of foot as a little hare, and full of health and spirits.
Frances was always laughing, and it was a laugh so utterly joyous and free from care, that
it seemed to have no place in this weary, hard-working, grasping, eager, restless nineteenth
century, but to belong to some early age, before the world had lost its freshness, or better
still, to be an earnest, with all that is good and true, of the "Restoration of all things."

She was leaning her head against Kate's shoulder, and talking eagerly.

"And then, dear Kate, as you have made up your mind to be a schoolmistress in Westminster,
and to teach those poor little sickly children whom no one seems to care for, I have made up
my mind to be an hospital nurse, and Mother Agnes has given her consent; and oh Kate, every
spare minute they give me shall be spent with you.  And you will have some dear little sitting-room
looking on the river, I know.  And there we shall sit together, and watch the rush of life
on the river; and talk of a hundred things--of your school children and my patients, and the
beautiful things that happen to us, and the comic ones.  And, as we are talking, Mother Agnes
will perhaps come in for a cup of tea (having come up to town on some errand), and you will
give her the nicest tea possible, and then we three will sit there still when it is dark, and
talk of everything in heaven and on earth.  And when the girls from here are put out to places
in London, they will come and see you, and have tea with you in your little sitting-room."

Voices and rushings of feet were heard on the stairs.

"Kate! where is Kate?"

"Kate, you are wanted in the schoolroom!"

"O Kate, here you are!  Now, guess what has come for you from London!"

Little hands seized hold of Kate, and the children's eagerness was so great that she was obliged
to remind them that she had only a wooden leg, and couldn't get downstairs quickly.

"Kate, we can't keep it back, we must tell you!  It is your cork leg arrived.  Mother Agnes
has given the last five pounds herself, and ordered the leg to be here by Christmas."

But when Kate was introduced to her new member, with injunctions to treat it with due respect,
she was quite overcome.  She leaned against the wall and sobbed.  She had never cried when
she lost her leg; and it was only the love and kindness shown her that made her cry now.  But
the tears were only for a moment,--and they were followed by a great rush of gladness.

CHAPTER VI.

CHRISTMAS DAY.

"Why, my dear old Kate, you're only half awake yet, and the little ones have been up for hours
already, and Christmas Day has broken upon the world once more.  There; give me a kiss, and
wish me a merry Christmas in a proper manner."

"Another Christmas," said Kate, half dreamily, raising herself in bed. "Frances, what are you
doing?"

"Finishing a frock for poor Aunt's youngest; but oh, Kate, I have been watching the dawn too,
such a lovely dawn; I shall never forget it. There, lean your head against me while I tell
you about it.  The light came creeping, creeping up, so slowly, and so shyly.  Then suddenly
the clouds parted, and a burst of glory came, making the dull snow, and even the icicles look
warm in the red light.  And was it stupid, do you think?  I couldn't help thinking of you and
the little children in Westminster, and how you would watch the sunshine coming into so many
little desolate lives."

so of course you will be quite glad to be tired.  And then He will not let you bear one tired
feeling alone.  It will be like those verses in your favourite poem:--

  "But this it was that made me move,
    As light as carrier-birds in air;
    I loved the weight I had to bear,
  Because it needed help of Love.

  Nor could I weary, heart or limb,
    When mighty Love would cleave in twain,
    The lading of a single pain,
  And part it, giving half to Him."

"O Kate, what a life!  And then to think that all these little dawnings we see in people's
lives are only pictures of the great dawn coming, when all things will be made new.  Kate,
doesn't it make you unutterably glad?"
