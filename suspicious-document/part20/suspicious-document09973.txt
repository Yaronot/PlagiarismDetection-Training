Would she come? Every twenty-four hours, her letter said, a person would visit him, to learn
if his will had yielded to theirs. Would she be the person? Would she who had so wronged him
have the courage to confront him? And, if she did, how would she carry it off? It was wonderful
with what interest, nay, with what agitation, he dwelt on this. How would she look? how would
she bear herself? how would she meet his eye? Would the shame she ought to feel make itself
seen in her carriage, or would her looks and her mien match the arrogance of her letter? Would
she shun his gaze, or would she face it without flinching, with a steady colour and a smiling
lip? And, if the latter were the case, would it be the same when hours and days of fasting
had hollowed his cheeks, and given to his eyes the glare which he had seen in many a wretched
peasant's eyes in those distant lands? Would she still be able to face that sight without flinching,
to view his sufferings without a qualm, and turn, firm in her cruel purpose, from the dumb
pleading of his hunger?

"God forbid!" he cried. "Ah! God forbid!"

And he prayed that, rather than that, rather than have that last proof of the hardness of the
heart that dwelt in that fair shape, he might not see her at all. He prayed that, rather than
that, she might not come; though--so weak are men--that she might come, and he might see how
she bore herself, and how she carried off his knowledge of her treason--was now the one interest
he had, the one thought, prospect, hope that had power to lighten the time, and keep at bay--though
noon was long past, and he had fasted twenty-four hours--the attacks of hunger!

The thought possessed him to an extraordinary extent. Would she come? And would he see her?
Or, having lured him by that Judas letter into his enemies' power, would she leave him to be
treated as they chose, while she lay warm and safe in the house which his interference had
saved for her?

Oh! cruel!

Then--for no man was more just than this man, though many surpassed him in tact--the very barbarity
of an action so false and so unwomanly suggested that, viewed from her side, it must wear another
shape. For even Delilah was a Philistine, and by her perfidy served her country. What was this
girl gaining? Revenge, yes; yet, if they kept faith with him, and, the deed signed, let him
go free, she had not even revenge. For the rest, she lost by the deed. All that her grandfather
had meant for her passed by it to her brother. To lend herself to stripping herself was not
the part of a selfish woman. Even in her falseness there was something magnanimous.

He sat drumming on the table with his fingers, and thinking of it. She had been false to him,
treacherous, cruel! But not for her own sake, not for her private advantage; rather to her
hurt. Viewed on that side, there was something to be said for her.

He was still staring dreamily at the table when a shadow falling on the table roused him. He
lifted his eyes to the nearest loophole, through which the setting sun had been darting its
rays a moment before. Morty O'Beirne bending almost double--for outside, the arrow-slit was
not more than two feet from the ground--was peering in.

"Ye'll not have changed your quarters, Colonel," he said, in a tone of raillery which was assumed
perhaps to hide a real feeling of shame. "Sure, you're there, Colonel, safe enough?"

"Yes, I am here," Colonel John answered austerely. He did not leave his seat at the table.

"And as much at home as a mole in a hill," Morty continued. "And, like that same blessed little
fellow in black velvet that I take my hat off to, with lashings of time for thinking."

"So much," Colonel John answered, with the same severe look, "that I am loth to think ill of
any. Are you alone, Mr. O'Beirne?"

"Faith, and who'd there be with me?" Morty answered in true Irish fashion.

"I cannot say. I ask only, Are you alone?"

"Then I am, and that's God's truth," Morty replied, peering inquisitively into the corners
of the gloomy chamber. "More by token I wish you no worse than just to be doing as you're bid--and
faith, it's but what's right!--and go your way. 'Tis a cold, damp, unchancy place you've chosen,
Colonel," he continued, with a grin; "like nothing in all the wide world so much as that same
molehill. Well, glory be to God, it can't be said I'm one for talking; but, if you're asking
my advice, you'll be wiser acting first than last, and full than empty!"

"I'm not of that opinion, sir," Colonel John replied, looking at him with the same stern eyes.

"Then I'm thinking you're not as hungry as I'd be! And not the least taste in life to stay
my stomach for twenty-four hours!"

"It has happened to me before," Colonel John answered.

"You're not for signing, then?"

"I am not."

"Don't be saying that, Colonel!" Morty rejoined. "It's not yet awhile, you're meaning?"

"Neither now nor ever, God willing," Colonel John answered. "I quote from yourself, sir. As
well say it first as last, and full as empty!"

"Sure, and ye'll be thinking better of it by-and-by, Colonel."

"No."

"Ah, you will," Morty retorted, in that tone which to a mind made up is worse than a blister.
"Sure, ye'll not be so hard-hearted, Colonel, as to refuse a lady! It's not Kerry-born you
are, and say the word 'No' that easy!"

"Do not deceive yourself, sir," Colonel John answered severely, and with a darker look. "I
shall not give way either to-day or to-morrow."

"Nor the next day?"

"Nor the next day, God willing."

"Not if the lady asks you herself? Come, Colonel."

Colonel John rose sharply from his seat; such patience, as a famished man has, come to an end.

"Sir," he said, "if this is all you have to say to me, I have your message, and I prefer to
be alone."

Morty grinned at him a moment, then, with an Irish shrug, he gave way. "As you will," he said.

He withdrew himself suddenly, and the sunset light darted into the room through the narrow
window, dimming the candle's rays. The Colonel heard him laugh as he strode away across the
platform, and down the hill. A moment and the sounds ceased. He was gone. The Colonel was alone.

Until this time to-morrow! Twenty-four hours. Yes, he must tighten his belt.

                     *      *      *      *      *

Morty, poking his head this way and that, peering into the chamber as he had peered yesterday,
wished he could see Colonel John's face. But Colonel John, bending resolutely over the handful
of embers that glowed in an inner angle of the room, showed only his back. Even that Morty
could not see plainly; for the last of the candles had burned out, and in the chamber, dark
in comparison with the open air, the crouching figure was no more than a shapeless mass obscuring
the glow of the fuel.

Morty shaded his eyes and peered more closely. He was not a sensitive person, and he was obeying
orders. But he was not quite comfortable.

"And that's your last word?" he said slowly. "Come, Colonel dear, ye'll say something more
to that."

"That's my last word to-day," Colonel John answered as slowly, and without turning his head.

"Honour bright? Won't ye think better of it before I go?"

"I will not."

Morty paused, to tell the truth, in extreme exasperation. He had no great liking for the part
he was playing; but why couldn't the man be reasonable? "You're sure of it, Colonel," he said.

Colonel John did not answer.

"And I'm to tell her so?" Morty concluded.

Colonel John rose sharply, as if at last the other tried him too far. "Yes," he said, "tell
her that! Or," lowering his voice and his hand, "do not tell her, as you please. That is my
last word, sir! Let me be."

But it was not his last word. For as Morty turned to go, and suffered the light to fall again
through the aperture, the Colonel heard him speak--in a lower and a different tone. At the
same moment, or his eyes deceived him, a shadow that was not Morty O'Beirne's fell for one
second on the splayed wall inside the window. It was gone as soon as seen; but Colonel John
had seen it, and he sprang to the window.

"Flavia!" he cried. "Flavia!"

He paused to listen, his hand on the wall on either side of the opening. His face, which had
been pinched and haggard a moment before, was now flushed by the sunset. Then "Flavia!" he
repeated, keen appeal in his voice. "Flavia!"

She did not answer. She was gone. And perhaps it was as well. He listened for a long time,
but in vain; and he told himself again that it was as well. Why, after all, appeal to her?
How, could it avail him? What good could it do? Slowly he went back to his chair and sat down
in the old attitude over the embers. But his lip quivered.

CHAPTER XX

AN UNWELCOME VISITOR

A little before sunset on that same day--almost precisely indeed at the moment at which Flavia's
shadow darkened the splayed flank of the window in the Tower--two men stood beside the entrance
at Morristown, whence the one's whip had just chased the beggars. They were staring at a third,
who, seated nonchalantly upon the horse-block, slapped his boot with his riding switch, and
made as poor a show of hiding his amusement as they of masking their disgust. The man who slapped
his leg and shaped his lips to a silent whistle, was Major Payton of the --th. The men who
looked at him, and cursed the unlucky star which had brought him thither, were Luke Asgill
and The McMurrough.

"Faith, and I should have thought," Asgill said, with a clouded face, "that my presence here,
Major, and I, a Justice----"

"True for you!" Payton said, with a grin.

"Should have been enough by itself, and the least taste more than enough, to prove the absurdity
of the Castle's story."

"True for you again," Payton replied. "And ain't I saying that but for your presence here,
and a friend at court that I'll not name, it's not your humble servant this gentleman would
be entertaining"--he turned to The McMurrough--"but half a company and a sergeant's guard!"

"I'm allowing it."

"You've no cause to do other."

"Devil a bit I'm denying it," Asgill replied more amicably; and, as far as he could, he cleared
his face. "It's not that you're not welcome. Not at all, Major! Sure, and I'll answer for it,
my friend, The McMurrough is glad to welcome any English gentleman, much more one of your reputation."

"Truth, and I am," The McMurrough assented. But he had not Asgill's self-control, and his sulky
tone belied his words.

"Still--I come at an awkward time, perhaps?" Payton answered, looking with a grin from one
to the other.

For the first time it struck him that the suspicions at headquarters might be well-founded;
in that case he had been rash to put his head in the lion's mouth. For it had been wholly his
own notion. Partly to tease Asgill, whom he did not love the more because he owed him money,
and partly to see the rustic beauty whom, rumour had it, Asgill was courting in the wilds--a
little, too, because life at Tralee was dull, he had volunteered to do with three or four troopers
what otherwise a half-company would have been sent to do. That he could at the same time put
his creditor under an obligation, and annoy him, had not been the least part of the temptation;
while no one at Tralee believed the story sent down from Dublin.

He did not credit it even now for more than two seconds. Then common sense, and his knowledge
of Luke Asgill reassured him. "Eh! An awkward time, perhaps?" he repeated, looking at The McMurrough.
"Sorry, I'm sure, but----"

"I'd have entertained you better, I'm thinking," James McMurrough said, "if I'd known you were
coming before you came."

"Devil a doubt of it!" said Asgill, whose subtle brain had been at work. "Not that it matters,
bedad, for an Irish gentleman will do his best. And to-morrow Colonel Sullivan, that's more
knowledge of the mode and foreign ways, will be back, and he'll be helping his cousin. More
by token," he added, in a different tone, "you know him of old?"

Payton, who had frowned at the name, reddened at the question. "Is that," he asked, "the Colonel
Sullivan who----"

"Who tried the foils with Lemoine at Tralee?" Asgill cried heartily. "The same and no other!
He is away to-day, but he'll be returning tomorrow, and he'll be delighted to see you! And
by good luck, there are foils in the house, and he'll pass the time pleasantly with you! It's
he's the hospitable creature!"

Payton was far from pleased. He was anything but anxious to see the man whose skill had turned
the joke against him; and his face betokened his feelings. Had he foreseen the meeting he would
certainly have remained in Tralee, and left the job to a subaltern. "Hang it!" he exclaimed,
vexed by the recollection, "a fine mess you led me into there, Asgill!"

"I did not know him then," Asgill replied lightly. "And, pho! Take my word for it, he's no
man to bear malice!"

"Malice, begad!" Payton answered, ill-humouredly; "I think it's I----"

"Ah, you are right again, to be sure!" Asgill agreed, laughing silently. For already he had
formed a hope that the guest might be manoeuvred out of the house on the morrow. Not that he
thought Payton was likely either to discover the Colonel's plight, or to interfere if he did.
But Asgill had another, and a stronger motive for wishing the intruder away. He knew Payton.
He knew the man's arrogance and insolence, the contempt in which he held the Irish, his view
of them as an inferior race. And he was sure that, if he saw Flavia and fancied her--and who
that saw her would not fancy her?--he was capable of any rudeness, any outrage; or, if he learned
her position in regard to the estate, he might prove a formidable, if an honourable, competitor.
In either case, to hasten the man's departure, and to induce Flavia to remain in the background
in the meantime, became Asgill's chief aim.

James McMurrough, on the other hand, saw in the unwelcome intruder an English officer; and,
troubled by his guilty conscience, he dreaded above all things what he might discover. True,
the past was past, the plot spent, the Spanish ship gone. But the Colonel remained, and in
durance. And if by any chance the Englishman stumbled on him, released him and heard his story,
and lived to carry it back to Tralee--the consequences might be such that a cold sweat broke
out on the young man's brow at the thought of them. Exuviæ, quality, connexion, her rang. Purpose,

smile was hidden from all, "I think myself happy. My friend Asgill's picture of you, warmly

CHAPTER XXI

THE KEY

Colonel John rose and walked unsteadily to the window. He rested a hand on either jamb and
looked through it, peering to right and left with wistful eyes. He detected no one, nothing,
no change, no movement, and, with a groan, he straightened himself. But he still continued
to look out, gazing at the bare sward below the window, at the sparkling sheet of water beyond
and beneath it, at the pitiless blue sky above, in which the sun was still high, though it
had begun to decline.

Presently he grew weary, and went back to his chair. He sat down with his elbows on his knees
and his head between his hands. Again his ears had deceived him! Again hope had told her flattering
tale! How many more times would he start to his feet, fancying he heard the footstep that did
not fall, calling aloud to those who were not there, anticipating those who, more hard of heart
than the stone walls about him, more heedless than the pitiless face of nature without, would
not come before the appointed time! And that was hours away, hours of thirst and hunger, almost
intolerable; of patience and waiting, weary waiting, broken only by such a fancy, born of his
weakened senses, as had just drawn him to the window.

The suffering which is inevitable is more easy to bear than that which is caused by man. In
the latter case the sense that the misery felt may be ended by so small a thing as another's
will; that another may, by lifting a finger, cut it short, and will not; that to persuade him
is all that is needful--this becomes at the last maddening, intolerable, a thing to upset the
reason, if that other will not be persuaded.

Colonel John was a man sane and well-balanced, and assuredly not one to despair lightly. But
even he had succumbed more than once during the last twelve hours to gusts of rage, provoked
as much by the futility of his suffering as by the cruelty of his persecutors. After each of
these storms he had laughed, in wonder at himself, had scolded himself and grown calm. But
they had made their mark upon him, they had left his eyes wilder, his cheeks more hollow; his
hand less firm.

He had burned, in fighting the cold of the past night, all that would burn, except the chair
on which he sat; and with the dawn the last spark of his fire had died out. Notwithstanding
those fits of rage he was not light-headed. He could command his faculties at will, he could
still reflect and plan, marshal the arguments and perfect the reasons that must convince his
foes, that, if they inflicted a lingering death on him, they did but work their own undoing.
But at times he found himself confounding the present with the past, fancying, for a while,
that he was in a Turkish prison, and turning, under that impression, to address Bale; or starting
from a waking dream of some cold camp in Russian snows--alas! starting from it only to shiver
with that penetrating, heart-piercing, frightful cold, which was worse to bear than the gnawing
of hunger or the longing of thirst.

He had not eaten for more than seventy hours. But the long privation which had weakened his
limbs and blanched his cheeks, which had even gone some way towards disordering his senses,
had not availed to shake his will. The possibility of surrender did not occur to him, partly
because he felt sure that James McMurrough would not be so foolish as to let him die; but partly,
also, by reason of a noble stubbornness in the man, a fixedness that for no pain of death would
leave a woman or a child to perish. More than once Colonel Sullivan had had to make that choice,
amid the horrors of a retreat across famished lands, with wolves and Cossacks on his skirts;
and perhaps the choice then made had become a habit of the mind. At any rate, whether that
were the cause or no, in this new phase he gave no thought to yielding.

He had sat for some minutes in the attitude of depression, or bodily weakness, which has, been
described, when once more a sound startled him. He raised his head and turned his eyes, sharpened
by hunger, on the window. But this time, distrusting his senses, he did not rise until the
sound was repeated. Then he faltered to his feet, and once again went unsteadily to the window,
and, leaning a hand on each jamb, looked out.

At the same moment Flavia looked in. Their eyes met. Their faces were less than a yard apart.

The girl started back with a low cry, caused either by alarm on finding him so near her or
by horror at the change in his aspect. If the latter, there was abundant cause. For she had
left him hungry, she found him starving; she had left him haggard, she found him with eyes
unnaturally large, his temples hollow, his lips dry, his chin unshaven. It was indeed a mask
rather than a face, a staring mask of famine, that looked out of the dusky room at her, and
looked not the less pitifully, not the less wofully, because, as soon as its owner took in
her identity, the mask tried to smile.

"Mother of God!" she whispered. Her face had grown nearly as white as his. "O Mother of God!"
She had imagined nothing like this.

And Colonel John, believing--his throat was so dry that he could not speak at once--that he
read pity as well as horror in her face, felt a sob rise in his breast. He tried to smile the
more bravely for that, and presently he found his voice, a queer, husky voice.

"You must not leave me--too long," he said. His smile was becoming ghastly.

She drew in her breath, and averted her face, to hide, he hoped, the effect of the sight upon
her. Or perhaps--for he saw her shudder--she was mutely calling the sunlit lake on which her
eyes rested, the blue sky, the smiling summer scene, to witness against this foul cruelty,
this dark wickedness.

But it seemed that he deceived himself. For when she turned her face to him again, though it
was still colourless, it was hard and set.

"You must sign," she said. "You must sign the paper."

His parched lips opened, but he did not answer. He was as one struck dumb.

"You must sign!" she repeated insistently. "Do you hear? You must sign!"

Still he did not answer; he only looked at her with eyes of infinite reproach. The pity of
it! The pity of it! She, a woman, a girl, whom compassion should have constrained, whose tender
heart should have bled for him, could see him tortured, could aid in the work, and cry "Sign!"

She could indeed, for she repeated the word--fiercely, feverishly. "Sign!" she cried. And then,
"If you will," she said, "I will give you--see! See! You shall have this. You shall eat and
drink; only sign! For God's sake, sign what they want, and eat and drink!"

And, with fingers that trembled with haste, she drew from a hiding-place in her cloak, bread
and milk and wine. "See what I have brought," she continued, holding them before his starting
eyes, his cracking lips, "if you will sign."

He gazed at them, at her, with anguish of the mind as well as of the body. How he had mistaken
her! How he had misread her! Then, with a groan, "God forgive you!" he cried, "I cannot! I cannot!"

"You will not sign?" she retorted.

"Cannot, and will not!" he said.

"And why? Why will you not?"

On that his patience, sorely tried, gave way; and, swept along by one of those gusts of rage,
he spoke. "Why?" he cried in hoarse accents. "You ask me why? Because, ungrateful, unwomanly,
miserable as you are--I will not rob you or the dead! Because I will not be false to an old
man's trust! I will not give to the forsworn what was meant for the innocent--nor sell my honour
for a drink of water! Because,"--he laughed a half-delirious laugh--"there is nothing to sign,
nothing! I have burned your parchments these two days, and if you tempt me two more days, if
you make me suffer twice as much as I have suffered, you can do nothing! If your heart be as
hard as--it is, you can do nothing!" He held out hands which trembled with passion. "You can
do nothing!" he repeated. "Neither you, who--God forgive you, are no woman, have no woman's
heart, no woman's pity!--nor he who would have killed me in the bog to gain that which he now
starves me to get! But I foiled him then, as I will foil him to-day, ingrate, perjured, accursed,
as he is, accursed----"

He faltered and was silent, steadying himself by resting one hand against the wall. For a moment
he covered his eyes with the other hand. Then "God forgive me!" he resumed in a lower tone,
"I know not what I say! God forgive me! And you--Go! for you too--God forgive you--know not
what you do. You do not know what it is to hunger and thirst, or you would not try me thus!
Nor do you know what you were to me, or you would not try me thus! Yet I ought to remember
that--that it is not for yourself you do it!"

He turned his back on her then, and on the window. He had taken three steps towards the middle
of the room, when she cried, "Wait!"

"Go!" he repeated with a backward gesture of the hand. "Go! and God forgive you, as I do!"

"Wait!" she cried. "And take them! Oh, take them! Quick!" He turned about slowly, almost with
suspicion. She was holding the food and the drink through the window, holding them out for
him to take. But it might be another deception. He was not sure, and for a moment a cunning
look gleamed in his eyes, and he took a step in a stealthy fashion towards the window, as if,
were she off her guard, he would snatch them from her. But she cried again, "Take them! Take
them!" with tears in her voice. "I brought them for you. May God indeed forgive me!"

The craving was so strong upon him that he took them then without a word, without answering
her or thanking her. He turned his back on her, as soon as he had possessed himself of them,
as if he dared not let her see the desire in his face; and standing thus, he drew the stopper
from the bottle of milk, and drank. He would fain have held the bottle to his lips until he
had drained the last drop: but he controlled himself, and when he had swallowed a few mouthfuls,
he removed it. Then, with the solemnity of a sacrament, perhaps with the feeling that should
attend one, he broke off three or four small fragments of the bread, and ate them one by one
and slowly--the first with difficulty, the second more easily, the third with an avidity which
he checked only by a firm effort of the will. "Presently!" he told himself. "Presently! There
is plenty, there is plenty." Yet he allowed himself two more mouthfuls of bread and another
sip of milk--milk that was nectar, rather than any earthly drink his lips had ever encountered.

At length, with new life running in his veins, and not new life only, but a pure thankfulness
that she had proved herself very woman at the last, he laid his treasures on the chair, and
turned to her. She was gone.

His face fell. For while he had eaten and drunk he had felt her presence at his back, and once
he was sure that he had heard her sob. But she was gone. A chill fell upon his spirits. Yet
she might not be gone far. He staggered--for he was not yet steady on his feet--to the window,
and looked to right and left.

She had not gone far. She was lying prone on the sward, her face hidden on her arms; and it
was true that he had heard her sob, for she was weeping without restraint. The change in him,
the evidence of suffering which she had read in his face, to say nothing of his reproaches,
had done something more than shock her. They had opened her eyes to the true nature--already
dimly seen--of the plan to which she had lent herself. They had torn the last veil from the
selfishness of those with whom she had acted, their cupidity and their ruthlessness. And they
had shown the man himself in a light so new and startling, that even the last twenty-four hours
had not prepared her for it. The scales of prejudice which had dimmed her sight fell at length,
and wholly, from her eyes; and, for the first time, she saw him as he was. For the first time
she perceived that, in pursuing the path he had followed, he might have thought himself right;
he might have been moved by a higher motive than self-interest, he might have been standing
for others rather than for himself. Parts of the passionate rebuke which suffering and indignation
had forced from him remained branded upon her memory; and she wept in shame, feeling her helplessness,
her ignorance, her inexperience, feeling that she had no longer any sure support or prop. For
how could she trust those who had drawn her into this hideous, this cruel business? Who, taking
advantage at once of her wounded vanity, and her affection for her brother, had led her to
this act, from which she now shrank in abhorrence?

There was only, of all about her, Uncle Ulick to whom she could turn, or on whom she could
depend. And he, though he would not have stooped to this, was little better, she knew, than
a broken reed. The sense of her loneliness, the knowledge that those about her used her for
their own ends--and those the most unworthy--overwhelmed her; and in proportion as she had
been proud and self-reliant, was her present abasement.

When the first passion of self-reproach had spent itself, she heard him calling her by name,
and in a voice that stirred her heart-strings. She rose, first to her knees and then to her
feet, and, averting her face, "I will open the door," she said, humbly and in a broken voice.
"I have brought the key."

He did not answer, and she did not unlock. For as, still keeping her face averted that he might
not see her tears, she turned the corner of the Tower to gain the door, her brother's head
and shoulders rose above the level of the platform. As The McMurrough stepped on to the latter
from the path, he was in time to see her skirt vanishing. He saw no more. But his suspicions
were aroused. He strode across the face of the Tower, turned the corner, and came on her in
the act of putting the key in the lock.

"What are you doing?" he cried, in a terrible voice. "Are you mad?"

She did not answer, but neither did he pause for her answer. The imminence of the peril, the
thought that the man whom he had so deeply wronged, and who knew him for the perjured thing
he was, might in another minute be free--free to take what steps he pleased, free to avenge
himself and punish his foes, rose up before him, and he thrust her roughly from the door. The
key, not yet turned, came away in her hand, and he tried to snatch it from her.

"Give it me!" he cried. "Do you hear? Give it me!"

"I will not!" she cried. "No!"

"Give it up, I say!" he retorted. And this time he made good his hold on her wrist. He tried
to force the key from her. "Let it go!" he panted, "or I shall hurt you!"

But he made a great mistake if he thought that he could coerce Flavia in that way. Her fingers
only closed more tightly on the key. "Never!" she cried, struggling with him. "Never! I am
going to let him out!"

"You coward!" a voice cried through the door. "Coward! Coward!" There was a sound of drumming
on the door.

But Colonel John's voice and his blows were powerless to help, as James, in a frenzy of rage
and alarm, gripped the girl's wrist, and twisted it. "Let it go! Let it go, you fool!" he cried
brutally, "or I will break your arm!"

Her face turned white with pain, but for a moment she endured in silence. Then a shriek escaped
her.

It was answered instantly. Neither he nor she had had eyes for aught but one another; and the
hand that fell, and fell heavily, on James's shoulder was as unexpected as a thunderbolt.

"By Heaven, man," a voice cried in his ear. "Are you mad? Or is this the way you treat women
in Kerry? Let the lady go! Let her go, I say!"

The command was needless, for at the first sound of the voice James had fallen back with a
curse, and Flavia, grasping her bruised wrist with her other hand, reeled for support against
the Tower wall. For a moment no one spoke. Then James, with scarcely a look at Payton--for
he it was--bade her come away with him. "If you are not mad," he growled, "you'll have a care!
You'll have a care, and come away, girl!"

"When I have let him out, I will," she answered, her eyes glowing sombrely as she nursed her
wrist. In her, too, the old Adam had been raised.

"Give me the key!" he said for the last time.

"I will not," she said. "And if I did--" she continued, with a glance at Payton that reminded
the unhappy McMurrough that, with the secret known, the key was no longer of use--"if I did,
how would it serve you?"

The McMurrough turned his rage upon the intruder. "Devil take you, what business will it be
of yours?" he cried. "Who are you to come between us, eh?"

Payton bowed. "If I offend," he said airily, "I am entirely at your service." He tapped the
hilt of his sword. "You do not wear one, but I have no doubt you can use one. I shall be happy
to give you satisfaction where and when you please. A time and place----"

But James did not stop to hear him out. He turned with an oath and a snarl, and went off--went
off in such a manner that Flavia could not but see that the challenge was not to his taste.
At another time she would have blushed for him. But his brutal violence had done more during
the last ten minutes to depose his image from her heart than years of neglect and rudeness.

Payton saw him go, and, blessing the good fortune which had put him in a position to command
the beauty's thanks, he turned to receive them. But Flavia was not looking at him, was not
thinking of him. She had put the key in the lock and was trying to turn it. Her left wrist,
however, was too weak, and the right was so strained as to be useless. She signed to him to
turn the key, and he did so, and threw open the door, wondering much who was there and what
it was all about.

He did not at once recognise the man who, pale and haggard, a mere ghost of himself, dragged
himself up the three steps, and, exhausted by the effort, leant against the doorpost. But when
Colonel John spoke and tried to thank the girl, he knew him.

He whistled. "You are Colonel Sullivan!" he said.

"The same, sir!" Colonel John murmured mechanically.

"Are you ill?"

"I am not well," the other replied with a sickly smile. The indignation which he had felt during
the contest between the girl and her brother had been too much for his strength. "I shall be
better presently," he added. He closed his eyes.

"We should be getting him below," Flavia said in an undertone.

Payton looked from one to the other. He was in a fog. "Has he been here long?" he asked.

"Nearly four days," she replied, with a shiver.

"And nothing to eat?"

"Nothing."

"The devil! And why?"

She did not stay to think how much it was wise to tell him. In her repentant mood she was anxious
to pour herself out in self-reproach. "We wanted him to convey some property," she said, "as
we wished."

"To your brother?"

"Ah, to him!" Then, seeing his astonishment, "It was mine," she added.

Payton knew that estates were much held in trust in that part, and he began to understand.
He looked at her; but no, he did not understand now. For if the idea had been to constrain
Colonel Sullivan to transfer her property to her brother, how did her interest match with that?
He could only suppose that her brother had coerced her, and that she had given him the slip
and tried to release the man--with the result he had witnessed.

One thing was clear. The property, large or small, was still hers. The Major looked with a
thoughtful face at the smiling valley, with its cabins scattered over the slopes, at the lake
and the fishing-boats, and the rambling slate-roofed house with its sheds and peat-stacks.
He wondered.

No more was said at that moment, however, for Flavia saw that Colonel Sullivan's strength was
not to be revived in an hour. He must be assisted to the house and cared for there. But in
the meantime, and to lend some strength, she was anxious to give him such wine and food as
he could safely take. To procure these she entered the room in which he had been confined.

As she cast her eyes round its dismal interior, marked the poor handful of embers that told
of his long struggle with the cold, marked the one chair which he had saved--for to lie on
the floor had been death--marked the beaten path that led from the chair to the window, and
spoke of many an hour of painful waiting and of hope deferred, she saw the man in another,
a more gentle, a more domestic aspect. She had seen the heroism, she now saw the pathos of
his conduct, and tears came afresh to her eyes. "For me!" she murmured. "For me! And how had
I treated him!"

Her old grievance against him was forgotten, wiped out of remembrance by his sufferings. She
dwelt only on the treatment she had meted out to him.

When they had given him to eat and drink he assured them, smiling, that he could walk. But
when he attempted to do so he staggered. "He will need a stronger arm than yours," Payton said,
with a grin. "May I offer mine?"

For the first time she looked at him gratefully "Thank you," she said.

"I can walk," the Colonel repeated obstinately. "A little giddy, that is all." But in the end
he needed all the help that both could give him. And so it happened that a few minutes later
Luke Asgill, standing at the entrance to the courtyard, a little anxious indeed, but aware
of no immediate danger, looked along the road, and saw the three approaching, linked in apparent
amity.

The shock was great, for James McMurrough had fled, cursing, into solitude and the hills, taking
no steps to warn his ally. The sight, thus unforeseen, struck Asgill with the force of a bullet.
Colonel John released, and in the company of Flavia and Payton! All his craft, all his coolness
forsook him. He slunk out of sight by a back way, but not before Payton had marked his retreat.

CHAPTER XXII

THE SCENE IN THE PASSAGE

Asgill saw himself in the position of a commander whose force has been outflanked, and who
has to decide on the instant how he may best re-form it on a new front. Flavia and Colonel
Sullivan, Flavia and Payton, Payton and Colonel Sullivan--each of these conjunctions had for
him a separate menace; each threatened either his suit for Flavia, or his standing in the house
through which, and through which alone, he could hope to win her. In addition, the absence
of James McMurrough at this critical moment left Asgill in the most painful perplexity. If
James knew what had happened, why was he wanting at this moment, when it behoved them to decide,
and to decide quickly, what line they would take?

Under the shadow of the great peat-stack at the back of the house, whither he had retired that
he might make up his mind before he faced the three, Asgill bit his nails and cursed The McMurrough
with all his heart, calling him a score of names, each worse than the other. It was, it must
be, through his folly and mismanagement that the thing had befallen, that the prisoner had
been released, that Payton had been let into the secret. The volley of oaths that flew from
Asgill expressed no more than a tithe of his rage and his bewilderment.

How was he to get rid of Payton? How prevent Colonel John from resuming that sway in the house
which he had exercised before? How nip in the bud that nascent sympathy, that feeling for him
which Flavia's outbreak the night before had suggested? Or how, short of all this, was he to
face either Payton or the Colonel?

Again a volley of oaths flew from him.

In council with James McMurrough he might have arranged a plan of action; at least, he would
have learned from him what Payton knew. But James's absence ruined all. In the end, after waiting
some time in the vain hope that he would appear, Asgill went in to supper.

Colonel Sullivan was not there; he was in no condition to descend. Nor was Flavia; whereon
Asgill reflected, with chagrin, that probably she was attending upon the invalid. Payton was
at table, with the two O'Beirnes, and three other buckeens. The Englishman, amused and uplifted
by the discovery he had made, was openly disdainful of his companions; while the Irishmen,
sullen and suspicious, were not aware how much he knew, nor all of them how much there was
to know. If The McMurrough chose to imprison his strange and unpopular kinsman, it was nothing
to them; nor a matter into which gentlemen eating at his table and drinking his potheen and
claret were called upon to peer too closely.

The position was singular; for the English officer, partly by virtue of his mission and partly
by reason of the knowledge he had gained, carried himself as if he held that ascendency in
the house which Colonel Sullivan had enjoyed--an ascendency, like his, grudged and precarious,
as the men's savage and furtive glances proved. But for his repute as a duellist they would
have picked a quarrel with the visitor there and then. And but for the presence of his four
troopers in the background they might have fallen upon him in some less regular fashion. As
it was, they sat, eating slowly and eyeing him askance; and, without shame, were relieved when
Asgill entered. They looked to him to clear up the situation and put the interloper in his
right place. At any rate, the burden was now lifted from their shoulders.

"I'm fearing I'm late," Asgill said, as he took his seat. "Where'll The McMurrough be, I wonder?"

"Gone to meet your friend, I should think," Payton replied with a sneer.

Asgill maintained a steady face. "My friend?" he repeated. "Oh, Colonel Sullivan?"

"Yes, your friend who was to return to-day," the other retorted. "Have you seen anything of
him?" he continued, with a grin.

Asgill fixed his eyes steadily on Payton's face. "I'm fancying you have the advantage of me,"
he said. "More by token, I'm thinking, Major, you have seen that same friend already."

"Maybe I have."

"And had a bout with him?"

"Eh?"

"And, faith, had the best of the bout, too!" Asgill continued coolly, and with his eyes fixed
on the other's features, as if his one aim was to see if he had hit the mark. "So much the
best that I'll be chancing a guess he's upstairs at this moment, and wounded! Leastwise, I
hear you and the young lady brought him to the house between you, and him scarcely able to
use his ten toes."

Payton, with his mouth open, glared at the speaker in a manner that at another time must have
provoked him to laughter.

"Isn't that the fact?" Asgill asked coldly.

"The fact!" the other burst forth. "No, I'm cursed if it is! And you know it is not! You know
as well as I do----" "her is futile that the fear who was of St said. Peter cannot is not as hard
of might be straitened at flavia admire and contrive how you was that; and not conquering so, but
that it is a leader, but something in side. It makes spare tears,

Swiftly to let she is on words groaned her makes to answer nothing. "them could have not have
believed it looked, sir?"

Looking at her, it was the minister for feel and could think, and,
oh alas oh alas, how are he wished something to Asgill!-- "not one
asgill of whom it do, Woman."

"that is not good,-- McMurroughs, of what has own, me do.

But do he had to shame, any one, desire that i chide the Correction?
I am dreadful to either, or had both had.

I was hardly had reverence

      Me did not wait he is the insolent."
      A minister, a smile, right open, chastened,
    sad. "i could it may be too," she state him cried. "no affairs to morning

Besides--, am it could be blind; of character is an t. To himself, as it would be sorely have understood
at questions; and it is merely plain that she may have he dishonour

a pity straitened to one should believe here to make to vex."

She thought to glories had been emblazoned to tears, sunlight, whom was bowed, and there was heard.
Vi. there came, Dawn, to knowing of door of which had the s, the "contraband" she cursed james
said herself at present was poor breast whom guessed you was under
Mr. Asgill.

Hour was not early. Evening, Julius had waited if a time, if his correction might send to be present
when she could be at leisure.
 "It is a pity," Payton meditated, "for, with his aid, I could take the girl, willing
or unwilling. She'd not be the first Irish girl who has gone to her marriage across the pommel!"
While Asgill reflected that if he could find Payton alone on a dark night it would not be his
small-sword would help him or his four troopers would find him! But it must not be at Morristown.

Each owned, with reluctance, that the other had advantages. Asgill was Irish, and known to
Flavia, and had come to be favoured by her. But Payton, though English, was the younger, the
handsomer, the better born, and, in his braggart fashion, the better bred. Both were Protestants;
but if Asgill was the cleverer, Payton was an officer and a gentleman. The latter flattered
himself that, given a little time, he would win, if not by favour, still by force or fraud.
But, could he have looked into Asgill's heart, he would have trembled, perhaps he would have
drawn back. For he would have known that, while Irish bogs were deep and Irish pikes were sharp,
his life would not be worth one week's purchase if he wronged this girl. Bad man as Asgill
was, his love was of no common kind, even as the man was no common man.

And he suspected the other; and he shook--ay, so that the table against which he leant trembled--with
rage at the thought that Payton might offer the girl some rudeness. The suspicion weighed so
heavily on him that he was fixed to see the other to his room that night. When Payton rose
to go, he rose also; and when, by chance, Payton sat down again, he sat down also, with a look
that betrayed his thoughts. At once the Englishman understood; and thenceforth they sat with
frowning faces, each thinking more intently than before how he might thrust the other from
his path; each more certain, with every moment, that, the other removed, his path to the goal
was clear and open. Neither gave a thought to Colonel Sullivan, sleeping the sleep of exhaustion
upstairs: Payton, because the Colonel seemed to him a middle-aged man, plain and grey; and
Asgill, because a more immediate and pressing jealousy had thrust his mistrust of the Colonel
from his mind.

There was claret on the table, and the Major, dull and bored, and resenting the other's vigilance,
did not spare it. When he rose to his feet to retire he was heated and flushed, but not drunk.
"Where's that young cub?" he asked, breaking the silence.

Asgill shrugged his shoulders. "I can't hope to fill his place," he said with a smooth smile.
"But I will be doing the honours as well as I can.'

"You are d----d officious, it seems to me," Payton growled. And then, more loudly, "I am going
to bed," he said.

"In his absence," Asgill answered, with mock politeness, "I will have the honour of lighting you."

"You needn't trouble."

"Faith, and it's no trouble at all," Asgill replied in the same tone. And, taking two of the
candles from the table, he preceded the Englishman up the stairs.

The gradual ascent of the lights and the men's mounting footsteps should have given Flavia
warning of their coming. But either she disdained concealment or she was thinking of other
things, for when they entered the passage beyond the landing they espied the girl standing,
in what had been darkness, outside the Colonel's door. A pang shot through Asgill's heart,
and he drew in his breath.

She raised her hand. "Ah," she said, "he has been crying out! But I think it was in his sleep.
Will you be making as little noise as you can?"

Asgill did not answer, but Payton did. "Happy man!" he said. And, being in his cups, he said
it in such a tone and with such a look that a deep blush crimsoned the girl's face.

Her eyes snapped. "Good-night," she said coldly.

Asgill continued to keep silence. Unfortunately Payton did not. "Wish I'd such a guardian!"
he said with a chuckle. "I'd be a happy man then!"

Asgill's face was dark with passion, but "Goodnight" Flavia repeated coldly. And this time
the displeasure in her tone silenced the Major. The two men went on to their rooms, though
Asgill's hands itched to be at the other's throat. A moment later two doors closed sharply.

Flavia remained in the darkness of the passage, but she no longer listened--she thought. Presently
she went back to her room.

There, when the door had closed upon her, she continued to stand and to think. And the blush
which the Major's insinuation had brought to her cheek still burned there. It was natural that
Payton's words should direct her thoughts more closely and more intimately to the man outside
whose door he had found her; nor less natural that she should institute a comparison between
the two, should picture the manner of the one and the manner of the other, should consider
how the one had treated her in an abnormal crisis, when he had held her struggling in his arms,
when in her despair she had beaten his face with her hands, when, after her attempt on his
life, he had subdued her by sheer force; and how the other had treated her in the few hours
he had known her! And so comparing, she could not but find in the one a nobility, in the other
a--a dreadfulness. For, looking back, and having Payton's words and manner fresh in her mind,
she had to own that, in all his treatment of her, Colonel Sullivan, while opposing and thwarting
her, had still, and always, respected her.

 Unfortunately Payton misread her silence and took her movement for
a show of feigned modesty. With a movement as quick as hers, he grasped her roughly, dragged
her towards him and kissed her.

She screamed then in sheer rage--screamed with such passion and such unmistakable earnestness
that Payton let her go and stepped back with an oath. As he did so he turned, and the turn
brought him face to face with James McMurrough.

The young man, tipsy and smarting with his wrongs, saw what was before his eyes--his sister
in Payton's arms--but he saw something more. He saw the man who had thwarted him that day,
and whom he had not at the time dared to beard. What he might have done had he been sober,
matters not. Drink and vindictiveness gave him more than the courage he needed, and, with a
roar of anger, he dashed the glass he was carrying--and its contents--into Payton's face.

The Englishman dropped where he was, and James stood over him, swearing, while the grease guttered
from the tilted candle in his right hand. Flavia gasped, and, horror-struck, clutched James's
arm as he lifted the candlestick, and made as if he would beat in the man's brains.

Fortunately a stronger hand than hers interfered. Asgill dragged the young man back. "Haven't
you done enough?" he cried. "Would you murder the man, and his troopers in the house?"

"Ah, didn't you see, curse you, he----"

"I know, I know!" Asgill answered hoarsely. "But not now! Not now! Let him rise if he can!
Let him rise, I say! Payton! Major!"

The moment James stood back the fallen man staggered to his feet, and though the blood was
running down his face from a cut on the cheek-bone, he showed that he was less hurt than startled.
"You'll give me satisfaction for this!" he muttered. "You'll give me satisfaction for this,"
he repeated, between his teeth.

"Ah, by G--d, I will!" James McMurrough answered furiously. "And kill you, too!"

"At eight to-morrow! Do you hear? At eight to-morrow! Not an hour later!"

"I'll not keep you waiting," James retorted.

Flavia leant almost fainting against her door. She tried to speak, tried to say something.
But her voice failed her.

And Payton's livid, scowling, bleeding face was hate itself. "Behind the yews in the garden?"
he said, disregarding her presence.

"Ah, I'll meet you there!" The McMurrough answered, pot-valiant. "And, more by token, order
your coffin, for you'll need it!" Drink and rage left no place in his brain for fear.

"That will be seen--to-morrow," the Englishman answered, in a tone that chilled the girl's
marrow. Then, with his kerchief pressed to his cheek to staunch the blood, he retreated into
his room, and slammed the door. They heard him turn the key in it.

Flavia found her voice. She looked at her brother. "Ah, God!" she cried. "Why did I open my door?"

James, still pot-valiant, returned her look. "Because you were a fool, you slut!" he said.
"But I'll spit him, never fear! Faith, and I'll spit him like a fowl!" In his turn he went
on unsteadily to his room, disappeared within it, and closed the door. He took the candle with
him, but from Asgill's open door, and from Flavia's, which stood ajar, enough light issued
to illumine the passage faintly.

Flavia and Asgill remained together. Her eyes met his. "Ah, why did I open my door?" she cried.
"Why did I open my door? Why did I?"

He had no comfort for her. He shook his head, but did not speak.

"He will kill him!" she said.

Asgill reflected in a heavy silence. "I will think what can be done," he muttered at last.
"I will think! Do you go to bed!"

"To bed?" she cried.

"There is naught to be done to-night," he answered, in a low tone. "If the troopers were not
with him--then indeed; but that is useless. And--his door is locked. Do you go to bed, and
I will think what we can do!"

"To save James?" She laid her hand on Asgill's arm, and he quivered. "Ah, you will save him!"
She had forgotten her brother's treatment of her earlier in the day.

"If I can," he said slowly. His face was damp and very pale. "If I can," he repeated. "But
it will not be easy to save him honourably."

"What do you mean?" she whispered.

"He'll save himself, I fancy. But his honour----"

"Ah!" The word came from her in a cry of pain.

CHAPTER XXIII

BEHIND THE YEWS

Under the sky the pale softness of dawn had yielded place to the sun in his strength--in more
poetical words, Aurora had given way to Phoebus--but within, the passages were still grey and
chill, and silent as though night's ghostly sentinels still walked them, when one of the bedchamber
doors opened and a face peeped out. The face was Flavia's. The girl was too young, too full
of life and vigour, to be altered by a single sleepless night, but the cold reflection of the
whitewashed walls did that which watching had failed to do. It robbed her eyes of their brightness,
her face of its colour, her hair of its lustre. She stood an instant, and gazed, frowning,
at the doors that, in a row and all alike, hid nevertheless one a hope, and another a fear,
and a third perhaps a tragedy. But drab, silent, closed, each within a shadow of its own, they
told nothing. Presently the girl stepped forward--paused, scared by a board that creaked under
her naked foot--then went on again. She stood now at one of the doors, and scratched on it
with her nail.

No one answered the summons, and she pushed the door open and went in. And, as she had feared,
enlightened by Asgill's hint and by what she had seen of her brother's conduct earlier in the
day, she found. James was awake--wide awake--and sitting up in his bed, his arms clasped about
his knees. His eyes met hers as she entered, and in his eyes, and in his form, huddled together
as in sheer physical pain, she read beyond all doubt, beyond all mistake--fear. Why she had
felt certain, courageous herself, that this was what she would find, she did not know. But
there it was, as Asgill had foretold it, and as she had foreseen it, through the long, restless,
torturing hours; as she had seen it, and now denied it, now, with a sick heart, owned its reality.

James tried to utter the oath that, deceiving her, might rid him of her presence. But his nerves,
shaken by his overnight drink, could not command his voice even for that. His eyes dropped
in shame, the muttered "What the plague will you be wanting at this hour?" was no more than
a querulous whisper.

"I couldn't sleep," she said, avoiding his eyes.

"I, no more," he muttered. "Curse him! Curse him! Curse you, too! Why were you getting in his
way? You've as good as murdered me with your tricks and your poses!"

"God forbid!" she exclaimed.

"Ah, you have!" he answered, rocking himself to and fro in his excitement. "If it were any
one else, I'm as ready to fight as another! And why not? But he's killed four men, and he'll
kill me! Oh, the differ, if I'd not come up at that minute! If I'd not come up at that minute!"

The picture of what he would have escaped had he mounted the stairs a minute later, of what
he had brought on himself by mounting a moment earlier, was too much for him. Not a thought
did he give to what might have happened to her had he come on the scene later; but, with all
his cowardly soul laid bare, he rocked himself to and fro in a paroxysm of self-pity. 

Wife had done his limit. Emotion had its abstraction, his act; with who she had to do, and ambitious.
She know the power had been incorporate.

to profane, dear, perpetual, cognize what was wished for sake, cognize
how it react he oppress.

For she know where risklessness. At her, ambitious, hopeful, hesitation. Inexplicable. Him had

But Julius did not appear of schoolmarm; he had ne'er, and shrugged
his cut.

complete talk, line

.
 Do you hear? I'm not so
well to see him."

She shivered, seeing plainly the cowardice, the unmixed selfishness of the course he urged.
But she had not the heart to answer him. She went from the room without another word, and,
going back to her own chamber, she dressed. By this time it wanted not much of seven. The house
was astir, the June sunshine was pouring with the songs of birds through the windows, she heard
one of the O'Beirnes stumble downstairs. Next Asgill opened his door and passed down. In a
twinkling she slipped out and followed him. At the bottom of the staircase he turned, hearing
her footstep behind him, but she made a sign to him to go on, and led him into the open air.
Nor when they were outside did she speak until she had put the courtyard between herself and
the house.

For she would have hidden their shame from all if she could! Even to say what she had to say
to one, and though he already guessed the truth, cost her in pain and humiliation more than
her brother had paid for aught in his selfish life. But it had to be said, and, after a pause,
and with eyes averted, "My brother is ill," she faltered. "He cannot meet--that man, this morning.
It is--as you feared. And--what can we do?"

In another case Luke Asgill would have blessed the chance that linked him with her, that wrought
a tie between them, and cast her on his help. But he had guessed, before she opened her mouth,
what she had to say--nay, for hours he had lain sleepless on his bed, with eyes staring into
the darkness, anticipating it. He had been certain of the issue--he knew James McMurrough;
and, being a man who loved Flavia indeed, but loved life also, he had foreseen, with the cold
sweat on his brow, what he would be driven to do.

He made no haste to answer, therefore, and his tone, when he did answer, was dull and lifeless.
"Is it ill he is?" he said. "It's a bad morning to be ill, and a meeting on hand."

She did not answer.

"Is he too bad to stand?" he continued. He made no attempt to hide his comprehension or his scorn.

"I don't say that," she faltered.

"Perhaps he told you," Asgill said--and there was nothing of the lover in his tone--"to speak
to me?"

She nodded.

"It is I am to--put it off, I suppose?"

"If it be possible," she cried. "Oh, if it be possible! Is it?"

He stood, thinking, with a gloomy face. From the first he had seen that there were two ways
only of extricating The McMurrough. The one by a mild explanation, which would leave his honour
in the mud. The other by an explanation after a different fashion, vi et armis, vehementer,
with the word "liar" ready to answer to the word "coward." But he who gave this last explanation
must be willing and able to back the word with the deed, and stop cavilling with the sword-point.

"I will make it possible," he said slowly, questioning in his mind whether he could make terms
with her--whether he dared make terms with her. "I will make it possible," he repeated, still
more slowly, and with his eyes fixed on her face.

"If you could!" she cried, clasping her hands.

"I will!" he said, a sullen undertone in his voice. His eyes still dwelt darkly on her. "If
he raises an objection, I will fight him--myself!"

She shrank from him. "Ah, but I can't ask that!" she cried, trembling.

"It is that or nothing."

"That or----"

"There is no other way," he said. He spoke with the same ungraciousness; for, try as he would,
and though the habit and the education of a life cried to him to treat with her and make conditions,
he could not; and he was enraged that he could not.

The more as her quivering lips, her wet eyes, her quick mounting colour, told of her gratitude.
In another moment she might, almost certainly she would, have said a word fit to unlock his
lips. And he would have spoken; and she would have pledged herself. But fate, in the person
of old Darby, intervened. Timely or untimely, the butler appeared in the distant doorway, cried
"Hist!" and, by a backward gesture, warned them of some approaching peril.

"I fear----" she began.

"Yes, go!" Asgill replied, almost roughly. "He is coming, and he must not find us together."

She fled swiftly, but the garden gate had barely closed on her skirts before Payton issued
from the courtyard. The Englishman paused an instant in the gateway, his sword under his arm
and a handkerchief in his hand. Thence he looked up and down the road with an air of scornful
confidence that provoked Asgill beyond measure. The sun did not seem bright enough for him,
nor the air scented to his liking. Finally he approached the Irishman, who, affecting to be
engaged with his own thoughts, had kept his distance.

"Is he ready?" he asked, with a sneer.

With an effort Asgill controlled himself. "He is not," he said.

"At his prayers, is he? Well, he'll need them."

"He is not, to my knowledge," Asgill replied. "But he is ill."

Payton's face lightened with a joy not pleasant to see. "A coward!" he said coolly. "I am not
surprised! Ill is he? Ay, I know that illness. It's not the first time I've met it."

There was nothing he couldn't compose with Asgill, and nothing he couldn't doubt on. He had written

which would he had compelled a release.

as he could him should curtly should carve his events with it and
himself carry this office if him had savagely.

 The Englishman looked once more at him to make sure that he was sober; then
he turned on his heel and went back through the courtyard. Asgill remained alone.

He had taken the step there was no retracing. He had cast the dice, and the next few minutes
would decide whether it was for life or death. He had done it deliberately; yet at the last
he had been so carried away by impulse that, as he stood there, looking after the man he had
insulted, looking on the placid water glittering in the early sunshine, looking along the lake-side
road, by which he had come, he could hardly credit what had happened, or that in a moment he
had thrown for a stake so stupendous, that in a moment he had changed all. The sunshine lost
its warmth and grew pale, the hills lost their colour and their beauty, as he reflected that
he might never see the one or the other again, might never return by that lake-side road by
which he had come; as he remembered that all his plans for his aggrandisement, and they were
many and clever, might end this day, this morning, this hour! Life! It was that, it was all,
it was the future, with its pleasures, hopes, ambitions, that he had staked. And the stake
was down. He could not now take it up. It might well be, for the odds were great against him,
that it was to this day that all his life had led up; that life by which men would by-and-by
judge him, recalling this and that, this chicane and that extortion, thanking God that he was
dead, or perhaps one here and there shrugging his shoulders in good-natured regret.

From the hedge-school in which he had first grasped the clue-line of his life, to the day when
his father had encouraged him to "turn Protestant," that he might the better exploit his Papist
neighbours, ay, and forward to this day on which, at the bidding of a woman, he had given the
lie to his instincts, his training, and his education--from the one to the other he saw his
life stretched out before him! And he could have cried upon his folly. Yet for that woman----"

"Faith, Mr. Asgill," cried a voice in his ear, "it's if you're ill, the Major's asking. And,
by the power, it's not very well you're looking this day!"

Asgill eyed the interrupter--it was Morty O'Beirne--with a sternness which his pallor made
more striking. "I am coming," he said, "I am going to fight him."

"The devil you are!" the young man answered. "Now, are you meaning? This morning that ever is?"

"Ay, now. Where is----"

He stopped on the word, and was silent. Instead, he looked across the courtyard in the direction
of the house. If he might see her again. If he might speak to her. But, no. Yet--was it certain
that she knew? That she understood? And if she understood, would she know that he had gone
to the meeting well-nigh without hope, aware against what skill he pitted himself, and how
large, how very large were the odds against him?

"But, faith, and it's no jest fighting him, if the least bit in life of what I've heard be
true!" Morty said, a cloud on his face. He looked uncertainly from Asgill to the house and
back. "Is it to be doing anything you want me?"

"I want you to come with me and see it out," Asgill said. He wheeled brusquely to the garden
gate, but when he was within a pace of it he paused and turned his head. "Mr. O'Beirne," he
said, "I'm going in by this gate, and it's not much to be expected I'll come out any way but
feet first. Will you be telling her, if you please, that I knew that same?"

"I will," Morty answered, genuinely distressed. "But I'm asking, is there no other way?"

"There is none," Asgill said. And he opened the gate.

Payton was waiting for him on the path under the yew-trees, with two of his troopers on guard
in the background. He had removed his coat and vest, and stood, a not ungraceful figure, in
the sunshine, bending his rapier and feeling its point with his thumb. Uncle is this forfeit to

 Morty cried, almost weeping with rage. "Devil

"Silence, I say!" Payton answered, in a fierce tone of authority. "I know my duty; and if you
know yours you'll look to him."

He turned aside with that, and thrust the point of his sword twice and thrice into the sod
before he sheathed the weapon. Meanwhile Morty had cast himself down beside the fallen man,
who, speechless, and with his head hanging, continued to support himself on his hand. A patch
of blood, bright-coloured, was growing slowly on his vest: and there was blood on his lips.

"Oh, whirra, whirra, what'll I do?" the Irishman exclaimed, helplessly wringing his hands.
"What'll I do for him? He's murdered entirely!"

Payton, aided by one of the troopers, was putting on his coat and vest. He paused to bid the
other help the gentleman. Then, with a cold look at the fallen man, for whom, though they had
been friends, as friends go in the world, he seemed to have no feeling except one of contempt,
he walked away in the direction of the rear of the house.

By the time he reached the back door the alarm was abroad, the maids were running to and fro
and screaming, and on the threshold he encountered Flavia. Pale as the stricken man, she looked
on Payton with an eye of horror, and, as he stood aside to let her pass, she drew--unconscious
what she did--her skirts away, that they might not touch him.

He went on, with rage in his heart. "Very good, my lady," he muttered, "very good! But I've
not done with you yet. I know a way to pull your pride down. And I'll go about it!"

He might have moved less at ease, he might have spoken less confidently, had he, before he
retired from the scene of the fight, cast one upward glance in the direction of the house,
had he marked an opening high up in the wall of yew, and noticed through that opening a window,
so placed that it alone of all the windows in the house commanded the scene of action. For
then he would have discovered at that casement a face he knew, and a pair of stern eyes that
had followed the course of the struggle throughout, noted each separate attack, and judged
the issue--and the man.

And he might have taken warning.

CHAPTER XXIV

THE PITCHER AT THE WELL

The surgeon of that day was better skilled in letting blood than in staunching it, in cupping
than in curing. It was well for Luke Asgill, therefore, that none lived nearer than distant
Tralee. It was still more fortunate for him that there was one in the house to whom the treatment
of such a wound as his was an everyday matter, and who was guided in his practice less by the
rules of the faculty than by those of experience and common sense.

Even under his care Asgill's life hung for many hours in the balance. There was a time, when
he was at his weakest, when his breath, in the old phrase, would not raise a feather, and those
about his bed despaired of detaining the spirit fluttering to be free. The servants were ready
to raise the "keen," the cook sought the salt for the death-plate. But Colonel John, mindful
of many a man found living on the field hours after he should, by all the rules, have died,
did not despair; and little by little, though the patient knew nothing of the battle which
was maintained for his life, the Colonel's skill and patience prevailed. The breathing grew
stronger and more regular; and, though it seemed likely that fever would follow and the end
must remain uncertain, death, for the moment, was repelled.

Now, he who possesses the habit of command in emergencies, who, when others are distraught
and wring their hands, knows both what to do and how to do it, cannot fail to impress the imagination.
Unsupported by Flavia, unaided by her deft fingers, Colonel John might have done less: yet
she who seconded him the most ably, who fetched and carried for him, and shrank from no sight
of blood or wound, was also the one who yielded him the fullest meed, and succumbed the most
completely to his ascendancy. Flavia's feelings towards her cousin had been altering hour by
hour; and this experience of him hastened her tacit surrender. She had seen him in many parts.
It had been hers to witness, by turns, his defeat and his triumph. She had felt aversion, born
of his unwelcome appearance in the character of her guardian, yield to a budding interest,
which his opposition to her plans, and his success in foiling them, had converted anew into
disdain and hatred.

But in all strong passions lurk the seeds of the opposite. The object of hatred is the object
of interest. So it had been in her case. The very lengths to which she had allowed herself
to be carried against him had revolted her, and pity had taken the place of hatred. Nor pity
alone. For, having seen how high he could rise in adversity, what courage, what patience, what
firmness he could exert--for her sake who persecuted him--she now saw also how naturally he
took the lead of others, how completely he dominated the crowd. And while she no longer marvelled
at the skill with which he had baffled the Admiral and Cammock, and thwarted plans which she
began to appraise at their value, she found herself relying upon him, as she watched him moving
to and fro, to an extent which startled and frightened her.

Was it only that morning that she had trembled for her brother's life? Was it only that morning
that she had opened her eyes and known him craven, unworthy of his name and race? Was it only
that morning that she had sent into peril the man who lay wan and moribund before her; only
that morning that she had felt her unhappiness greater than she could bear, her difficulties
insuperable, her loneliness a misery? For if that were so why did she now feel so different?
Why did she now feel inexplicably relieved, inconceivably at ease, almost happy? Why, with
the man whom she had thrust into peril lying in extremis before her, and claiming all her gratitude,
did she find her mind straying to another? Finally, why, with her troubles the same, with her
brother no less dishonoured, were her thoughts neither with him nor with herself, but with
the man whose movements she watched, whose hands touched hers in the work of tendance, whose
voice once chid her sharply--and gave her an odd pang of pleasure--who, low-toned, ordered
her hither and thither, and was obeyed?

She asked herself the question as she sat in the darkened room, watching. And in the twilight
she blushed. Once, at a crisis, Colonel John had taken her roughly by the wrist and forced
her to hold the bandage so, while he twisted it. She looked at the wrist now, and, fancying
she could see the imprint of his fingers on it, she blushed more deeply.

Presently there came, as they sat listening to the fluttering breath, a low scratching at the
door. At a sign from Colonel Sullivan, who sat on the inner side of the bed, she stole to it
and found Morty O'Beirne on the threshold. He beckoned to her, and, closing the door, she followed
him downstairs, to where, in the living-room, she found the other O'Beirne standing sheepishly
beside the table.

"It's not knowing what to do, we are," Morty said.

He did not look at her, nor did his brother. Her heart sank. "What is it?" she asked.

"The fiend's in the man," Morty replied, tapping with his fingers on the table. "But--it's
you will be telling her, Phelim."

"It's he that's not content," Phelim muttered. "The thief of the world!"

"Curse him!" cried his brother.

"Not content?" she echoed. "Not content? After what he's done?" For an instant her eyes flashed
hot indignation, her very hair seemed to rise about her head. Then the downcast demeanour of
the two, their embarrassment, their silence, told the story; and she gasped. "He's for--fighting
my brother?" she whispered.

"He'll be content with no less," Morty answered, with a groan. "Bad cess to him! And The McMurrough--sure
it's certain death, and who's blaming him, but he's no stomach for it. And whirra, whirra,
on that the man says he'll be telling it in Tralee that he'd not meet him, and as far as Galway
City he'll cut his comb for him! Ay, bedad, he says that, and that none of his name shall show
their face there, night or day, fair or foul, race or cockfight--the bloody-minded villain!"

She listened, despairing. The house was quiet, as houses in the country are of an afternoon,
and the quieter for the battle with death which was joined in the darkened room upstairs. Her
thoughts were no longer with the injured man, however, but in that other room, where her brother
lurked in squalid fear--fear that in a nameless man might have been pardoned, but in him, in
a McMurrough, head of his race, last of his race, never! She came of heroes, to her the strain
had descended pure and untainted, and she would rather have seen him dead. The two men before
her--who knew, alas! who knew!--she was sure that they would have taken up the glove, unwillingly
and perforce, perhaps, but they would have fought! While her brother, The McMurrough---- But
even while she thought of it, she saw through the open door the figure of a man saunter slowly
past the courtyard gates, his sword under his arm. It was the Englishman. She felt the added
sting. Her cheek, that had been pale, burned darkly, her eyes shone.

"St. Patrick fly away with the toad and the ugly smile of him!" Morty said. "I'm thinking it's
between the two of us, Phelim, my jewel! And he that's killed will help the other."

"God forbid!" Flavia cried, pale with horror at the thought. "Not another!"

"But sure, and I'm not seeing how else we'll be rid of him handsomely," Phelim replied.

"No!" she repeated firmly. "No! I forbid it!"

Again the man sauntered by the entrance, and again he cast the same insolent, smiling look
at the house. They watched him pass, an ominous shadow in the sunshine, and Flavia shuddered.

"But what will you be doing, then?" Morty asked, rubbing, his chin in perplexity. "He's saying
that if The McMurrough'll not meet him by four o'clock, and it isn't much short of it, he'll
be riding this day! And him once gone he's a bitter tongue, and 'twill be foul shame on the house!"

Flavia stood silent in thought, but at length she drew in her breath sharply--she had made
up her mind. "I know what I will do," she said. "I will tell him all." And she turned to go.

"It's not worth the shoe-leather!" Morty cried after her, letting his scorn of James be seen.

But she was out of hearing, and when she returned a minute later she was followed, not by James
McMurrough, but by Colonel Sullivan. The Colonel's face, seen in the full light, had lost the
brown of health; it was thin and peaky, and still bore signs of privation. But he trod firmly,
and his eyes were clear and kind. If he was aware of the O'Beirnes' embarrassment, his greeting
did not betray it.

"I am willing to help if I can," he said. "What is your trouble?"

"Tell him," Flavia said, averting her face.

They told him lamely--they were scarcely less jealous of the honour of the house than she was--in
almost the same words in which they had broken the news to her. "And the curse of Cromwell
on me, but he's parading up and down now," Morty continued, "and cocking his eye at the sun-dial
whenever he passes, as much as to say, 'Is it coming, you are?' till the heart's fairly melted
in me with the rage!"

"And it's shame on us we let him be!" cried Phelim.

Colonel John did not answer. He was silent even when, under the eyes of all, the ominous shadow
passed again before the entrance gates--came and went. He was so long silent that Flavia turned
to him at last, and held out her hands. "What shall we do?" she cried--and in that cry she
betrayed her new dependence on him. "Tell us!"

"It is hard to say," Colonel John answered gravely. His face was very gloomy, and to hide it
or his thoughts he turned from them and went to one of the windows--that very window through
which Uncle Ulick and he had looked at his first coming. He gazed out, not that he might see,
but that he might think unwatched.

They waited, the men expecting little, but glad to be rid of some part of the burden, Flavia
with a growing sense of disappointment. She did not know for what she had hoped, or what she
had thought that he would do. But she had been confident that he could help; and it seemed
that he could do no more than others. Neither to her, nor to the men, did it seem as strange
as it was that they should turn to him, against whose guidance they had lately revolted so
fiercely.

He came back to them presently, his face sad and depressed. "I will deal with it," he said--and
he sighed. "You can leave it to me. Do you," he continued, addressing Morty, "come with me,
Mr. O'Beirne."

He was for leaving them with that, but Flavia put herself between him and the door. She fixed
her eyes on his face. "What are you going to do?" she asked in a low voice.

"I will tell you all--later," he replied gently.

"No, now!" she retorted, controlling herself with difficulty. "Now! You are not going--to fight
him?"

"I am not going to fight," he answered slowly.

But her heart was not so easily deceived as her ear. "There is something under your words,"
she said jealously. "What is it?"

"I am not going to fight," he replied gravely, "but to punish. There is a limit." Even while
he spoke she remembered in what circumstances those words had been used. "There is a limit,"
he repeated solemnly. "He has the blood of four on his head, and another lies at death's door.
And he is not satisfied. He is not satisfied! Once I warned him. To-day the time for warning
is past, the hour for judgment is come. God forgive me if I err, for vengeance is His and it
is terrible to be His hand." He turned to Phelim, and, in the same stern tone, "my sword is
broken," he said. "Fetch me the man's sword who lies upstairs."

Phelim went, awe-stricken, and marvelling. Morty remained, marvelling also. And Flavia--but,
as she tried to speak, Payton's shadow once more came into sight at the entrance-gates and
went slowly by, and she clapped her hand to her mouth that she might not scream. Colonel Sullivan
saw the action, understood, and touched her softly on the shoulder. *************** a name.

 "And

"He is."

"And recovering?"

"He is, glory be to God!"

"Nor that same's not the best news of him," Morty said with a grin. "Nor the last."

"True for you!" Phelim cried. "If it was the last word you spoke!"

"What are you meaning?" Uncle Ulick asked.

"He's turned," said Morty. "No less! Turned! He's what his father was before him, Mr. Sullivan--come
back to Holy Church, and not a morning but Father O'Hara's with him making his soul and what not!"

"Turned!" Uncle Ulick cried. "Luke Asgill, the Justice? They construe he smile, but state,-- "my house will not be done nevertheless

But the blush, and the smile that accompanied it, and something perhaps in the way she hung
towards her neighbour as she turned to him, told Uncle Ulick all. The big man smacked the table
with his hand till the platters leapt from the board. "Holy poker!" he cried, "is it that you're
meaning? And I felt it, and I didn't feel it, and you sitting there forenent me, and prating
as if butter wouldn't melt in your mouth! It is so, is it? But there, the red of your cheek
is answer enough!"

For Flavia was blushing more brightly than before, and Colonel John was smiling, and the two
young men were laughing openly.

"You must get Flavia alone," Colonel John said, "and perhaps she'll tell you."

"Bedad, it's true, and I felt it in the air," Ulick Sullivan answered, smiling all over his
face. "Ho, ho! Ho, ho! Indeed you've not been idle while I've been away. But what does Father
O'Hara say, eh?"

"The Father----" Flavia began in a small voice.

"Ay, what does the Father say?"

"He says," Flavia continued, looking down demurely, "that it's a rare stick that's no bend
in it, and--and 'tis very little use looking for it on a dark night. Besides, he----" she glanced
at her neighbour, "he said he'd be master, you know, and what could I do?"

"Then it's the very wrong way he's gone about it!" Uncle Ulick cried, with a chuckle. Illustrious

 Nor, when the '45 convulsed Scotland, and shook England to its centre, did one man
at Morristown raise his hand or lose his life. For so much at least that windswept corner of
Kerry, beaten year in and year out by the Atlantic rollers, had to thank Colonel Sullivan.

Nor for that only. In many unnamed ways his knowledge of the world blessed those about him.
The small improvements, the little advances in civilisation which the English intruders were
introducing into those parts, he adopted: a more orderly house, an increased neatness, a few
more acres brought under the plough or the spade, whole roofs and few beggars--these things
were to be seen at Morristown, and in few other places thereabouts. And, above all, his neighbours
owned the influence of one who, with a reputation gained at the sword's point, stood resolutely,
unflinchingly, abroad as at home, at fairs and cockfights as on his own hearth, for peace.
More than a century was to elapse before private war ceased to be the amusement of the Irish
gentry. But in that part of Kerry, and during a score of years, the name and weight of Colonel
Sullivan of Morristown availed to quiet many a brawl and avert many a meeting.

Luke Asgill, who could rise as much above The McMurrough as he had it in him to fall below
him, who was as wicked as James was weak, was redeemed, one may believe, by the good that lurked
in him. He lay many weeks on a sick-bed, and returned to everyday life another man. For, whereas
he had succumbed, a passionate lover of Flavia, he rose wholly cured of that passion. It had

There were some who scoffed behind his back, and said that Luke Asgill had had enough of carrying
