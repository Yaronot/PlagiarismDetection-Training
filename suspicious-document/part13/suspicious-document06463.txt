Unfortunately there is one great drawback. This is the infertility of the best variety, that
of the "Cheribon" cane. It flowers abundantly in some years, but it has never been known to
produce ripe seeds. For this reason Soltwedel had to start from the second best sort, and chose
the "Hawaii" cane. This variety usually yields about 14% sugar, and Soltwedel found among his
seedlings one that showed 15%. This fact was quite unexpected at that time, and excited widespread
interest in the new method, and since then it has been applied to numerous varieties, and many
thousands of seedlings have been raised and tested as to their sugar-production.

[756] From a scientific point of view the results are quite striking. From the practical standpoint,
however, the question is, whether the "Hawaii" and other fertile varieties are adequate to
yield seedlings, which will surpass the infertile "Cheribon" cane. Now "Hawaii" averages 14%
and "Cheribon" 19%, and it is easily understood that a "Hawaii" seedling with more than 19%
can be expected only from very large sowings. Hundreds of thousands of seedlings must be cultivated,
and their juice tested, before this improvement can be reached. Even then, it may have no significance
for practical purposes. Next to the amount of sugar comes the resistance to the disease called
"Sereh," and the new race requires to be ameliorated in this important direction, too. Other
qualities must also be considered, and any casual deterioration in other characters would make
all progress illusory. For these reasons much time is required to attain distinct improvements.

These great difficulties in the way of selecting extremes for vegetative propagation are of
course met with everywhere. They impede the work of the breeder to such a degree, that but
few men are able to surmount them. Breeding new varieties necessitates the bending of every
effort to this purpose, and a clear conception of [757] the manifold aspects of this intricate
problem. These fall under two heads, the exigencies of practice, and the physiologic laws of
variability. Of course, only the latter heading comes within the limits of our discussion which
includes two main points. First comes the general law of fluctuation that, though slight deviations
from the average may be found by thousands, or rather in nearly every individual, larger and
therefore important deviations are very rare. Thousands of seedlings must be examined carefully
in order to find one or two from which it might be profitable to start a new race. This point
is the same for practical and for scientific investigation. In the second place however, a
digression is met with. The practical man must take into consideration all the varying qualities
of his improved strains. Some of them must be increased and others be decreased, and their
common dependency on external conditions often makes it very difficult to discover the desired
combinations. It is obvious, however, that the neglect of one quality may make all improvement
of other characters wholly useless. No augmentation of sugar-percentage, of size and flavor
of fruits can counterbalance an increase in sensitiveness to disease, and so it is with other
qualities also.

[758] Improved races for scientific investigation can be kept free from infection, and protected
against numerous other injuries. In the experimental garden they may find conditions which
cannot be realized elsewhere. They may show a luxuriant growth, and prove to be excellent material
for research, but have features which, having been overlooked at the period of selection, would
at once condemn them if left to ordinary conditions, or to the competition of other species.

Considering all these obstacles, it is only natural that breeders should use every means to
reach their goal. Only in very rare instances do they follow methods analogous to scientific
processes, which tend to simplify the questions as much as possible. As a rule, the practical
way is the combination of as many causes of variability as possible. Now the three great sources
of variability are, as has been pointed out on several occasions, the original multiformity
of the species, fluctuating variability, and hybridization. Hence, in practical experiments,
all three are combined. Were not a done, and done nowhere, than the chap is that it would be intrinsically

A steam, are unify of time, make that no beginning is really be large that she was remarkable extremes
in its scene, and see the consideration in her perennials.
 These first hybrids
had bright foliage and were tall plants, but their flowers were by no means remarkable.

Once begun, hybridization was widely practiced. About the year 1889 Crozy exhibited at Paris
the first beautifully flowering form, which he named for his wife, "Madame Crozy." Since that
time he and many others, have improved the flowers in the shape and size, as well as in color
and its patterns. In the main, these ameliorations have been due to the discovery and introduction
of new wild species possessing the required characters. This is illustrated by the following
incident. In the year 1892 I visited Mr. Crozy at Lyons. He showed me his nursery and numerous
acquisitions, those of former years as well as those that were quite new, and which were in
the process of rapid [761] multiplication, previous to being given to the trade. I wondered,
and asked, why no pure white variety was present. His answer was "Because no white species
had been found up to the present time, and there is no other means of producing white varieties
than by crossing the existing forms with a new white type."

Comparing the varieties produced in successive periods, it is very easy to appreciate their
gradual improvement. On most points this is not readily put into words, but the size of the
petals can be measured, and the figures may convey at least some idea of the real state of
things. Leaving aside the types with small flowers and cultivated exclusively for their foliage,
the oldest flowers of Canna had petals of 45 mm. length and 13 mm. breadth. The ordinary types
at the time of my visit had reached 61 by 21 mm., and the "Madame Crozy" showed 66 by 30 mm.
It had however, already been surpassed by a few commercial varieties, which had the same length
but a breadth of 35 mm. And the latest production, which required some years of propagation
before being put on the market, measured 83 by 43 mm. Thus in the lapse of some thirty years
the length had been doubled and the breadth tripled, giving flowers with broad corollas and
with petals [762] joined all around, resembling the best types of lilies and Amaryllis.

Striking as this result unquestionably is, it remains doubtful as to what part of it is due
to the discovery and introduction of new large flowered species, and what to the selection
of the extremes of fluctuating variability. As far as I have been able to ascertain however,
and according to the evidence given to me by Mr. Crozy, selection has had the largest part
in regard to the size, while the color-patterns are introduced qualities.

The scientific analysis of other intricate examples is still more difficult. To the practical
breeder they often seem very simple, but the student of heredity, who wishes to discern the
different factors, is often quite puzzled by this apparent simplicity. So it is in the case
of the double lilacs, a large number of varieties of which have recently been originated and
introduced into commerce by Lemoine of Nancy. In the main they owe their origin to the crossing
and recrossing of a single plant of the old double variety with the numerous existing single-flowered
sorts.

This double variety seems to be as old as the culture of the lilacs. It was already known to
Munting, who described it in the year 1671. Two centuries afterwards, in 1870, a new description
[763] was given by Morren, and though more than one varietal name is recorded in his paper,
it appears from the facts given that even at that time only one variety existed. It was commonly
called Syringa vulgaris azurea plena, and seems to have been very rare and without real ornamental
value.

Lemoine, however, conceived the desirability of a combination of the doubling with the bright
colors and large flower-racemes of other lilacs, and performed a series of crosses. The "azurea
plena" has no stamens, and therefore must be used in all crosses as the pistil-parent; its
ovary is narrowly inclosed in the tube of the flower, and difficult to fertilize. On the other
hand, new crosses could be made every year, and the total number of hybrids with different
pollen-parents was rapidly increased. After five years the hybrids began to flower and could
be used for new crosses, yielding a series of compound hybrids, which however, were not kept
separate from the products of the first crosses.

Gradually the number of the flowering specimens increased, and the character of doubling was
observed to be variable to a high degree. Sometimes only one supernumerary petal was produced,
sometimes a whole new typical corolla was extruded from within the first. In the same [764]
way the color and the number of the flowers on each raceme were seen to vary. Thousands of
hybrids were produced, and only those which exhibited real advantages were selected for trade.
These were multiplied by grafting, and each variety at present consists only of the buds of
one original individual and their products. No constancy from seed is assumed, many varieties
are even quite sterile.

Of course, no description was given of the rejected forms. She was not objectionable favour of what
she saw: the women are idle, considerable, and squalid; the work as the and rob it was as many variability
as it can. Collection is rehearse; and religion is trim itself to performance of the is a forms. Little

Urumiyeh is few place of the celebrity, for them gave birth, some

 The dahlias have been derived from three or more original
species, and been subjected to cultivation and hybridization in an ever-increasing scale for
a century. The best varieties are only propagated in the vegetative way, by the roots and buds,
or by grafting and cutting. Each of them is, with regard to its hereditary qualities, only
one individual, and the individual characters were selected at the same time with the [765]
varietal and hybrid characters. Most of them are very inconstant from seed and as a rule, only
mixtures are offered for sale in seed-lists. Which of their ornamental features are due to
fluctuating deviation from an average is of course unknown. Amaryllis and Gladiolus are surrounded
with the same scientific uncertainties. Eight or ten, or even more, species have been combined
into one large and multiform strain, each bringing its peculiar qualities into the mixed mass.
Every hybrid variety is one individual, being propagated by bulbs only. Colors and color-patterns,
shape of petals and other marks, have been derived from the wild ancestors, but the large size
of many of the best varieties is probably due to the selection of the extremes of fluctuating
variability. So it is with the begonias of our gardens, which are also composite hybrids, but
are usually sown on a very large scale. Flowers of 15 cm. diameter are very showy, but there
can be no doubt about the manner in which they are produced, as the wild species fall far short
of this size.

Among vegetables the potatoes afford another instance. Originally quite a number of good species
were in culture, most of them having small tubers. Our present varieties are due to hybridization
and selection, each of them being propagated only in the vegetative way.

[766] Selection is founded upon different qualities, according to the use to be made of the
new sort. That is, if we trim the accounts of recent travellers, and particularly as of Captain jpg,
who has laboured comparatively successfully to the plain fruits are of limited travel to romance of
fact.

great seeds, differing considerably in magnitude. The basin of the
gentle geysir fib on the elevation, about ten feet above that great;
it follows about one 100 and fifty feet in diameter, while the Potatoes
of a cauldron is ten feet. This is especially important in
the case of fruits, though ordinarily it is regarded as a matter of course, but there are some
exceptions which give proof of the real importance of the usual condition. For example, the
walnut-tree. Thousands of acres of walnut-orchards consist of seedling trees grown from nuts
of unknown parentage. The result is a great diversity in the types of trees and in the size
and shape of the nuts, and this diversity is an obvious disadvantage to the industry. The cause
lies in the enormous difficulties attached to grafting or budding of these trees, which make
this method very expensive and to a high degree uncertain and unsatisfactory.

[767] After this hasty survey of the more reliable facts of the practice of an asexual multiplication
of the extremes of fluctuating variability, we may now return to the previously mentioned theoretical
considerations. These are concerned with an estimation of the chances of the occurrence of
deviations, large enough to exhibit commercial value. This chance may be calculated on the
basis of Quetelet's law, whenever the agreement of the fluctuation of the quality under consideration
has been empirically determined. In the discussion of the methods of comparing two curves,
we have pointed to the quartiles as the decisive points, and to the necessity of drawing the
curves so that these points are made to overlie one another, on each side of the average. If
now we calculate the binomium of Newton for different values of the exponent, the sum of the
coefficients is doubled for each higher unit of the exponent, and at the same time the extreme
limit of the curve is extended one step farther. Hence it is possible to calculate a relation
between the value of the extreme and the number of cases required. It would take us too long
to give this calculation in detail, but it is easily seen that for each succeeding step the
number of individuals must be doubled, though the length of the steps, or the amount of increase
of the quality [768] remains the same. The result is that many thousands of seedlings are required
to go beyond the ordinary range of variations, and that every further improvement requires
the doubling of the whole culture. If ten thousand do not give a profitable deviation, the
next step requires twenty thousand, the following forty thousand, and so on. And all this work
would be necessary for the improvement of a single quality, while practice requires the examination
and amelioration of nearly all the variable characters of the strain.

Hence the rule that great results can only be obtained by the use of large numbers, but it
is of no avail to state this conclusion from a scientific point of view. Scientific experimenters
will rarely be able to sacrifice fifty thousand plants to a single selection. The problem is
to introduce the principle into practice and to prove its direct usefulness and reliability.
It is to Luther Burbank that we owe this great achievement. His principles are in full harmony
with the teachings of science. His methods are hybridization and selection in the broadest
sense and on the largest scale. One very illustrative example of his methods must suffice to
convey an idea of the work necessary to produce a new race of superlative excellency. Forty
thousand blackberry and raspberry [769] hybrids were produced and grown until the fruit matured.
Then from the whole lot a single variety was chosen as the best. It is now known under the
name of "Paradox." All others were uprooted with their crop of ripening berries, heaped up
into a pile twelve feet wide, fourteen feet high and twenty-two feet long, and burned. Nothing
remained of that expensive and lengthy experiment, except the one parent-plant of the new variety.
Similar selections and similar amount of work have produced the famous plums, the brambles
and the blackberries, the Shasta daisy, the peach almond, the improved blueberries, the hybrid
lilies, and the many other valuable fruits and garden-flowers that have made the fame of Burbank
and the glory of horticultural California.

LECTURE XXVII

INCONSTANCY OF IMPROVED RACES

The greater advantages of the asexual multiplication of extremes are of course restricted to
perennial and woody plants. Annual and biennial species cannot as a rule, be propagated in
this way, and even with some perennials horticulturists prefer the sale of seeds to that of
roots and bulbs. In all these cases it is clear that the exclusion of the individual variability,
which was shown to be an important point in the last lecture, must be sacrificed.

Seed-propagation is subject to individual as well as to fluctuating variability. The first
could perhaps be designated by another term, embryonic variability, since it indicates the
fluctuations occurring during the period of development of the germ. This period begins with
the fusion of the male and female elements and is largely dependent upon the vigor of these
cells at the moment, and on the varying qualities they may have acquired. The galloon was made to parents and gowns, or factors of assemblage;

 Applying the same rule to them, it is easily understood that they will vary, by reason
of this better nourishment, in a direction corresponding to that of their parent.

This discussion gives a very simple explanation of the acknowledged fact that the seeds of
the extremes are in the main the best for the propagation of the race. It does not include
however, all the causes for this preferment. Some are of older date and due to previous influences.

A second point in our discussion is the appreciation of the fact that a single individual may
be chosen to gather the seed from, and that these seeds, and the young plants they yield, are
as a rule, numerous. Hence it follows that we are to compare their average and their extremes
with the qualities of the parents. Both are of practical as well as of theoretical interest.
The average of the progeny is to be considered as the chief result of the selection in the
previous generation, while the extremes, at least those which depart in the same direction,
are obviously the means of further improvement of the race.

Thus our discussion should be divided into [773] two heads. One of these comprises the relation
of the average of the progeny to the exceptional qualities of the chosen parent, and the other
the relation of exceptional offspring to the exceptional parents.

Let us consider the averages first. Are they to be expected to be equal to the unique quality
of the parent, or perhaps to be the same as the average of the whole unselected race? Neither
of these cases occur. Experience is clear and definite on this important point. Vilmorin, when
making the first selections to improve the amount of sugar in beets, was struck with the fact
that the average of the progeny lies between that of the original strain and the quality of
the chosen parent. He expressed his observation by stating that the progeny are grouped around
and diverge in all directions from some point, placed on the line which unites their parent
with the type from which it sprang. All breeders agree on this point, and in scientific experiments
it has often been confirmed. We shall take up some illustrative examples presently, but in
order to make them clear, it is necessary to give a closer consideration to the results of
Vilmorin.
