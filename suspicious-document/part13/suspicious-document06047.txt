Herman's married sister liked her brother Herman, and she did not want him not to like to be
with women. He was good, her brother Herman, and it would surely do him good to get married.
It would make him stand up for himself stronger. Herman's sister always laughed at him and
always she would try to reassure him. "Such a nice man as my brother Herman acting like as
if he was afraid of women. Why the girls all like a man like you Herman, if you didn't always
run away when you saw them. It do you good really Herman to get married, and then you got somebody
you can boss around when you want to. It do you good Herman to get married, you see if you
don't like it, when you really done it. You go along home now with papa, Herman and get married
to that Lena. You don't know how nice you like it Herman when you try once how you can do it.
You just don't be afraid of nothing, Herman. You good enough for any girl to marry, Herman.
Any girl be glad to have a man like you to be always with them Herman. You just go along home
with papa and try it what I say, Herman. Oh you so funny Herman, when you sit there, and then
run away and leave your girl behind you. I know she is crying like anything Herman for to lose
you. Don't be bad to her Herman. You go along home with papa now and get married Herman. I'd
be awful ashamed Herman, to really have a brother didn't have spirit enough to get married,
when a girl is just dying for to have him. You always like me to be with you Herman. I don't
see why you say you don't want a girl to be all the time around you. You always been good to
me Herman, and I know you always be good to that Lena, and you soon feel just like as if she
had always been there with you. Don't act like as if you wasn't a nice strong man, Herman.
Really I laugh at you Herman, but you know I like awful well to see you real happy. You go
home and get married to that Lena, Herman. She is a real pretty girl and real nice and good
and quiet and she make my brother Herman very happy. You just stop your fussing now with Herman,
papa. He go with you to-morrow papa, and you see he like it so much to be married, he make
everybody laugh just to see him be so happy. Really truly, that's the way it will be with you
Herman. You just listen to me what I tell you Herman." And so his sister laughed at him and
reassured him, and his father kept on telling what the mother always said about her Herman,
and he coaxed him and Herman never said anything in answer, and his sister packed his things
up and was very cheerful with him, and she kissed him, and then she laughed and then she kissed
him, and his father went and bought the tickets for the train, and at last late on Sunday he
brought Herman back to Bridgepoint with him.

It was always very hard to keep Mrs. Kreder from saying what she thought, to her Herman, but
her daughter had written her a letter, so as to warn her not to say anything about what he
had been doing, to him, and her husband came in with Herman and said, "Here we are come home
mama, Herman and me, and we are very tired it was so crowded coming," and then he whispered
to her. "You be good to Herman, mama, he didn't mean to make us so much trouble," and so old
Mrs. Kreder, held in what she felt was so strong in her to say to her Herman. She just said
very stiffly to him, "I'm glad to see you come home to-day, Herman." Then she went to arrange
it all with Mrs. Haydon.

Herman was now again just like he always had been, sullen and very good, and very quiet, and
always ready to do whatever his mother and his father wanted. Tuesday morning came, Herman
got his new clothes on and went with his father and his mother to stand up for an hour and
get married. Lena was there in her new dress, and her hat with all the pretty flowers, and
she was very nervous for now she knew she was really very soon to be married. Mrs. Haydon had
everything all ready. Everybody was there just as they should be and very soon Herman Kreder
and Lena Mainz were married.

When everything was really over, they went back to the Kreder house together. They were all
now to live together, Lena and Herman and the old father and the old mother, in the house where
Mr. Kreder had worked so many years as a tailor, with his son Herman always there to help him.

Irish Mary had often said to Lena she never did see how Lena could ever want to have anything
to do with Herman Kreder and his dirty stingy parents. The old Kreders were to an Irish nature,
a stingy, dirty couple. They had not the free-hearted, thoughtless, fighting, mud bespattered,
ragged, peat-smoked cabin dirt that irish Mary knew and could forgive and love. Theirs was
the german dirt of saving, of being dowdy and loose and foul in your clothes so as to save
them and yourself in washing, having your hair greasy to save it in the soap and drying, having
your clothes dirty, not in freedom, but because so it was cheaper, keeping the house close
and smelly because so it cost less to get it heated, living so poorly not only so as to save
money but so they should never even know themselves that they had it, working all the time
not only because from their nature they just had to and because it made them money but also
that they never could be put in any way to make them spend their money. Wat is SpÃ¶k? SpÃ¶k, dat's
stage in such a way as if de MÃ¼Ã¼r nibble '. Wihr Ã¼mmer hinhÃ¼rt, well, non-de slÃ¶ppt; wihr Awers
Sun bi deiht sedge is: 'na, se non worÃ¼mm salln nibble', de slÃ¶ppt.

" And at these phrases she increased afresh rapidly and went back and forward between the beds, on
their Flats for. All at one time, but she halted and turned back, as if they overlook 'what have. Â»HÃ¼ren,
Hradscheck, wat ick Se sedge still wull us' Line kÃ¼mmt ook wedder.

"Go, Mother Jeschke.

" "Woll. Awers se kÃ¼mmt ook ihrst to Martini 'rÃ¼mm ... And then, Hradscheck, Se bruker se

" XIX.

De Frenchman is falling, "Jeschke said was so odd and was there afresh
in self-assurance been, all with aim and calculation.

For if the dialogue even lasting result, it her over a year before,
her generally so docile close by with a VerlÃ¤umdungsklage was endangered,
she could, regardless of all this, not let the custom in dark allusions
to talk, as if she knew what and retaining back only.

"Damn," muttered Hradscheck to himself. "And to the eternal Ede with
his fear."

He apparently glimpsed the article arrive to life, and a dizziness grabbed him, when he considered
of all that could convey this state of things every day.

"This can not proceed on.

He should go.

But where to? " And at these phrases Hradscheck went up and down,
thinking.

"Where?

He is said to lie in the Oder. And then, he should ... the earlier the better ... Today. But I liked
this part of work would be done. At that time it was the blade I was seated at his throat. But
now!

Indeed, the embedding was not as awful as it is the persevering transfer.

" And propelled by worry and disquiet, it went into the churchyard and stood by the serious of his
wife. As was the angel with the torch and he read the inscription. But his ideas were of that what
he was not going on, and when he returned, it was decided: "Yes,
today ... What manage you desire to manage, soon.

" And he started to believe, how it should happen.

"If only I had certain thing Farrnkraut '.

But where there is Farrnkraut
here? Here is increasing so only Grass and barley, not anything more,
and I can not but Ireland adviser round 10 miles of the world, only
to a large wilderness Farrnkraut to get back home. And why? Nonsense
is it anyway. " He talked Keep it up.

But at last he
recalled, in the adjacent to reserve a Gusow have glimpsed all through
the plantation to Farrnkraut. And he called for in the backyard and
let .

Tensing At noon he came back, and before him,
in the back chair of the vehicle, there was a gigantic Farrnkrautbusch.
He rubbed from the kernels of kernels and mindfully put them in a
paper capsule and the capsule a drawer. Then he went back through
all he required was the serious of Sheik, the generally besides the
flower bed barrier was down to the basement and was changed, when
he was finished with these preparations.

He
whistled and hummed to herself and went into the store.

Â»Ede, you
can proceed out today afternoon.
Herman knew very well with his mother, it was all right if one ate very little and worked hard
all day and did not hear her when she scolded, the way Herman always had done before they were
so foolish about his getting married and having a girl there to be all the time around him,
and now he had to help her so the girl could learn too, not to hear it when his mother scolded,
and not to look so scared, and not to eat much, and always to be sure to save it.

Herman really did not know very well what he could do to help Lena to understand it. He could
never answer his mother back to help Lena, that never would make things any better for her,
and he never could feel in himself any way to comfort Lena, to make her strong not to hear
his mother, in all the awful ways she always scolded. It just worried Herman to have it like
that all the time around him. Herman did not know much about how a man could make a struggle
with a mother, to do much to keep her quiet, and indeed Herman never knew much how to make
a struggle against anyone who really wanted to have anything very badly. Herman all his life
never wanted anything so badly, that he would really make a struggle against any one to get
it. Herman all his life only wanted to live regular and quiet, and not talk much and to do
the same way every day like every other with his working. And now his mother had made him get
married to this Lena and now with his mother making all that scolding, he had all this trouble
and this worry always on him.

Mrs. Haydon did not see Lena now very often. It is not birthday. It is only dying day, dying day your children. But you forget
everything. Only you do not. "

"Oh, Ursel, let it. I have my head full of wonder. Thou must not make allegations. And then the
children.

Well, they are dead, but I can not grieve and complain that it's are.

Conversely, there is fortunate. "

"I do not understand you."

"And to understand all too well. I do
not still have to worry about and worry. "

"About what? All these things were very worrying now to Mrs. Haydon, but still she wanted to be good
to Lena, though she could not see her very often. She only saw her when Mrs. Haydon went to
call on Mrs. Kreder or when Mrs. Kreder came to see Mrs. Haydon, and that never could be very
often. Then too these days Mrs. Haydon could not scold Lena, Mrs. Kreder was always there with
her, and it would not be right to scold Lena, when Mrs. Kreder was there, who had now the real
right to do it. And so her aunt always said nice things now to Lena, and though Mrs. Haydon
sometimes was a little worried when she saw Lena looking sad and not careful, she did not have
time just then to really worry much about it.

Lena now never any more saw the girls she always used to sit with. She had no way now to see
them and it was not in Lena's nature to search out ways to see them, nor did she now ever think
much of the days when she had been used to see them. They never any of them had come to the
Kreder house to see her. Not even Irish Mary had ever thought to come to see her. Lena had
been soon forgotten by them. They had soon passed away from Lena and now Lena never thought
any more that she had ever known them.

The only one of her old friends who tried to know what Lena liked and what she needed, and
who always made Lena come to see her, was the good german cook who had always scolded. She
now scolded Lena hard for letting herself go so, and going out when she was looking so untidy.
"I know you going to have a baby Lena, but that's no way for you to be looking. I am ashamed
most to see you come and sit here in my kitchen, looking so sloppy and like you never used
to Lena. I never see anybody like you Lena. Herman is very good to you, you always say so,
and he don't treat you bad even though you don't deserve to have anybody good to you, you so
careless all the time, Lena, letting yourself go like you never had anybody tell you what was
the right way you should know how to be looking. No, Lena, I don't see no reason you should
let yourself go so and look so untidy Lena, so I am ashamed to see you sit there looking so
ugly, Lena. No Lena that ain't no way ever I see a woman make things come out better, letting
herself go so every way and crying all the time like as if you had real trouble. I never wanted
to see you marry Herman Kreder, Lena, I knew what you got to stand with that old woman always,
and that old man, he is so stingy too and he don't say things out but he ain't any better in
his heart than his wife with her bad ways, I know that Lena, I know they don't hardly give
you enough to eat, Lena, I am real sorry for you Lena, you know that Lena, but that ain't any
way to be going round so untidy Lena, even if you have got all that trouble. But under all circumstances
tried it with Hradscheck get back on a good foot because of their value of a good Neighborhood
made sense. Hradscheck his part, instead of playing the sensitive, as some others had done,
she had opposed it half way and was at all of such much candor, that, before the Fastelabend
were baked pancake, the whole story Szulski was as good as forgotten. Sundays only in the pitcher they came
now and then discussed.

"When you least fur de wedder Hücht would come to ..."

"Well, you wührst but Wullner antrecken the Pohl's sien 'fur eh?"

»Non antrecken? Worümm not it?

Dat de Pohlsche splashing around wihr, dat deiht em nothing. Un non ook Wed. Un wat Sünner
still inside wihr useful, well, dat nu joa wahrd wanted rut. "

"Joa, Joa. Wahrd dat nu joa wanted rut reasonable. "

And then we laughed and changed the subject.

Such jokes were the rule, and rarely was anyone to seriously on the Case came to speak on the
occasion and expressed his surprise that the body still is not driven. But then it was called,
"the dead lie 'in the mud and the silt would be out nothing, or at least until after fifty years,
when the alluvial foreshore Acker had become. Then would he be found even when plowing, just as
the French found would '. "

Yes, just as the Frenchman, who was now the main thing at all, much more than that with his wagon
crashed travelers, which also could not really be surprised. For
Disasters such as the Szulski'sche were frequent, or at least not
rare, while the Frenchman buried under the pear tree was all stuff
to the imagination in the Czech to put movement. All kinds of stories
were spun, and love stories, in their one stated that Anno 13 is a
Frenchman in love with a pretty Tschechinerin almost daily had come
from Küstrin ago by Czech, until he killed a rival and buried have.
This story did not even take the maids, but the older people remembered
very well that you have a different opinion or by Chasseur-a-corporal
Voltigeur I simply due to sharp foragers brought aside and made still. I never see Mrs. Aldrich how old people can be so bad to young girls and
not have no kind of patience with them. If Lena could only live with her Herman, he ain't so
bad the way men are, Mrs. Aldrich, but he is just the way always his mother wants him, he ain't
got no spirit in him, and so I don't really see no help for that poor Lena. I know her aunt,
Mrs. Haydon, meant it all right for her Mrs. Aldrich, but poor Lena, it would be better for
her if her Herman had stayed there in New York that time he went away to leave her. I don't
like it the way Lena is looking now, Mrs. Aldrich. She looks like as if she don't have no life
left in her hardly, Mrs. Aldrich, she just drags around and looks so dirty and after all the
pains I always took to teach her and to keep her nice in her ways and looking. It don't do
no good to them, for them girls to get married Mrs. Aldrich, they are much better when they
only know it, to stay in a good place when they got it, and keep on regular with their working.
I don't like it the way Lena looks now Mrs. Aldrich. I wish I knew some way to help that poor
Lena, Mrs. Aldrich, but she she is a bad old woman, that old Mrs. Kreder, Herman's mother.
I speak to Mrs. Haydon real soon, Mrs. Aldrich, I see what we can do now to help that poor Lena."

These were really bad days for poor Lena. Herman always was real good to her and now he even
sometimes tried to stop his mother from scolding Lena. "She ain't well now mama, you let her
be now you hear me. You tell me what it is you want she should be doing, I tell her. I see
she does it right just the way you want it mama. You let be, I say now mama, with that always
scolding Lena. You let be, I say now, you wait till she is feeling better." Herman was getting
really strong to struggle, for he could see that Lena with that baby working hard inside her,
really could not stand it any longer with his mother and the awful ways she always scolded.

It was a new feeling Herman now had inside him that made him feel he was strong to make a struggle. If he is innocent ,
so I'll see him again, sooner or afterwards, whether he is guilty, I shall observing him again.
"He was glad that he these vocabulary here at the solemn of the vanished, you can repeat the
glory and honor. Yes, it had always proved their religion and their feel of justice. But above
everybody, within their love. With trepidation, they possess the hours scored, burning their
intensity within sleepless nights, and when at last the hour of liberation
arrive, granted that it had collapsed. He was almost ready, so as to save his baby from all
trouble, to really make a strong struggle with his mother and with his father, too, if he would
not help him to control his mother.

Sometimes Herman even went to Mrs. Haydon to talk all this trouble over. They decided then
together, it was better to wait there all four together for the baby, and Herman could make
Mrs. Kreder stop a little with her scolding, and then when Lena was a little stronger, Herman
should have his own house for her, next door to his father, so he could always be there to
help him in his working, but so they could eat and sleep in a house where the old woman could
not control them and they could not hear her awful scolding.
