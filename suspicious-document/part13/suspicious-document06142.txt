NOTE

This book is a selection, slightly revised, from my miscellaneous work during the last four
or five years, and the title is that under which the bulk of it has appeared, month by month,
in the "Pall Mall Magazine." In selecting, I have omitted those pieces which hang upon other
people's books, plays, or pictures--a process of exclusion which, while giving unity to a possible
collection of my critical writings in another volume, leaves the first selection exclusively
egoistic.

A VISION OF THE BURDEN OF MAN

And it came to pass that my soul was vexed with the problems of life, so that I could not sleep.
So I opened a book by a lady novelist, and fell to reading therein. And of a sudden I looked
up, and lo! a great host of women filled the chamber, which had become as the Albert Hall for
magnitude--women of all complexions, countries, times, ages, and sexes. Some were bewitching
and beautiful, some wan and flat-breasted, some elegant and stately, some ugly and squat, some
plain and whitewashed, and some painted and decorated; women in silk gowns, and women in divided
skirts, and women in widows' weeds, and women in knickerbockers, and women in ulsters, and
women in furs, and women in crinolines, and women in tights, and women in rags; but every woman
of them all in tears. The great chamber was full of a mighty babel; shouts and ululations,
groans and moans, weeping and wailing and gnashing of false and genuine teeth, and tearing
of hair both artificial and natural; and therewith the flutter of a myriad fans, and the rustle
of a million powder-puffs. And the air reeked with a thousand indescribable scents--patchouli
and attar of roses and cherry blossom, and the heavy odours of hair-oil and dyes and cosmetics
and patent medicines innumerable.

Now when the women perceived me on my reading-chair in their midst, the shrill babel swelled
to a savage thunder of menace, so that I deemed they were wroth with me for intruding upon
them in mine own house; but as mine ear grew accustomed to the babel of tongues, I became aware
of the true import of their ejaculations.

"O son of man!" they cried, in various voices: "thy cruel reign is over, thy long tyranny is
done; thou hast glutted thyself with victims, thou hast got drunken on our hearts' blood, we
have made sport for thee in our blindness. But the Light is come at last, the slow night has
budded into the rose of dawn, the masculine monster is in his death-throes, the kingdom of
justice is at hand, the Doll's House has been condemned by the sanitary inspector."

I strove to deprecate their wrath, but my voice was as the twitter of a sparrow in a hurricane.
At length I ruffled my long hair to a leonine mane, and seated myself at the piano. And lo!
straightway there fell a deep silence--you could have heard a hairpin drop.

"What would you have me do, O daughters of Eve?" I cried. "What is my sin? what my iniquity?"
Then the clamour recommenced with tenfold violence, disappointment at the loss of a free performance
augmenting their anger.

"Give me a husband," shrieked one.

"Give me a profession," shrieked another.

"Give me a divorce," shrieked a third.

"Give me free union," shrieked a fourth.

"Give me an income," shrieked a fifth.

"Give me my deceased sister's husband," shrieked a sixth.

"Give me my divorced husband's children," shrieked a seventh.

"Give me the right to paint from the nude in the Academy schools," shrieked an eighth.

"Give me an Oxford degree," shrieked a ninth.

"Give me a cigar," shrieked a tenth.

"Give me a vote," shrieked an eleventh.

"Give me a pair of trousers," shrieked a twelfth.

"Give me a seat in the House," shrieked a thirteenth.

"Daughters of the horse-leech," I made answer, taking advantage of a momentary lull, "I am
not in a position to give away any of these things. You had better ask at the Stores." But
the tempest out-thundered me.

"I want to ride bareback in the Row in tights and spangles at 1 p. m. on Sundays," shrieked
a soberly clad suburban lady, who sported a wedding-ring. "I want to move the world with my
pen or the point of my toe; I want to write, dance, sing, act, paint, sculpt, fence, row, ride,
swim, hunt, shoot, fish, love all men from young rustic farmers to old town roues, lead the
Commons, keep a salon, a restaurant, and a zoological garden, row a boat in boy's costume,
with a tenor by moonlight alone, and deluge Europe and Asia with blood shed for my intoxicating
beauty. I am primeval, savage, unlicensed, unchartered, unfathomable, unpetticoated, tumultuous,
inexpressible, irrepressible, overpowering, crude, mordant, pugnacious, polyandrous, sensual,
fiery, chaste, modest, married, and misunderstood."

"But, madam," I remarked--for in her excitement she approached within earshot of me--"I understand
thee quite well, and I really am not responsible for thy emotions." Her literary style beguiled
me into the responsive archaicism of the second person singular.

"Coward!" she snapped. "Coward and satyr! For centuries thou hast trampled upon my sisters,
and desecrated womanhood."

"I beg thy pardon," I rejoined mildly.

"Thou dost not deserve it," she interrupted.

"Thou art substituting hysteria for history," I went on. "I was not born yesterday, but I have
only scored a few years more than a quarter of one century, and seeing that my own mother was
a woman, I must refuse to be held accountable for the position of the sex."

"Sophist!" she shrieked. "It is thy apathy and selfishness that perpetuate the evil."

Then I bethought me of my long vigils of work and thought, the slow, bitter years in which
I "ate my bread with tears, and sat weeping on my bed," and I remembered that some of those
tears were for the sorrows of that very sex which was now accusing me of organised injustice.
But I replied gently: "I am no tyrant; I am a simple, peaceful citizen, and it is as much as
I can do to earn my bread and the bread of some of thy sex. Life is hard enough for both sexes,
without setting one against the other. We are both the outcome of the same great forces, and
both of us have our special selfishnesses, advantages, and drawbacks. If there is any cruelty,
it is Nature's handiwork, not man's. So far from trampling on womanhood, we have let a woman
reign over us for more than half a century. We worship womanhood, we have celebrated woman
in song, picture, and poem, and half civilisation has adored the Madonna. Let us have woman's
point of view and the truth about her psychology, by all means. But beware lest she provoke
us too far. The Ewigweibliche has become too literal a fact, and in our reaction against this
everlasting woman question we shall develop in unexpected directions. Her cry for equal purity
will but end in the formal institution of the polygamy of the Orient--"

As I spoke the figure before me appeared to be undergoing a transformation, and, ere I had
finished, I perceived I was talking to an angry, seedy man in a red muffler.

"Thee keeps down the proletariat," he interrupted venomously. "Thee lives on the sweat of his
brow, while thee fattens at ease. Thee plants thy foot on his neck."

"Do I?" I exclaimed, lifting up my foot involuntarily.

Mistaking the motion, he disappeared, and in his stead I saw a withered old pauper with the
Victoria Cross on his breast. "I went to the mouth of hell for thee," he said, with large reproachful
eyes; "and thou leavest me to rot in the workhouse."

"I am awfully sorry!" I said. "I never heard of thee. It is the nation--"

"The nation!" he cried scornfully. "Thou art the nation; the nation is only a collection of
individuals. Thou art responsible. Thou art the man."

"Thou art the man," echoed a thousand voices: "Society is only an abstraction." And, looking
round, I saw, to my horror, that the women had quite disappeared, and their places were filled
by men of all complexions, countries, times, ages, and sexes.

"I died in the streets," shouted an old cripple in the background--"round the corner from thy
house, in thy wealthy parish--I died of starvation in this nineteenth century of the Christian
era, and a generation after Dickens's 'Christmas Carol.'"

"If I had only known!" I murmured, while my eyes grew moist. "Why didst thou not come to me?"

"I was too proud to beg," he answered. "The really poor never beg."

"Then how am I responsible?" I retorted.

"How art thou responsible?" cried the voices indignantly; and one dominating the rest added:
"I want work and can't get it. Dost thou call thyself civilised?"

"Civilised?" echoed a weedy young man scornfully.  "I am a genius, yet I have had nothing to
eat all day. Thy congeners killed Keats and Chatterton, and when I am dead thou wilt be sorry
for what thou hast not done."

"But hast thou published anything?" I asked.

"How could I publish?" he replied, indignantly.

"Then how could I be aware of thee?" I inquired.

"But my great-grandfather did publish," said another.  "Thou goest into ecstacies over him,
and his books have sold by tens of thousands; but me thou leavest pensionless, to earn my living
as a cooper. Bah!"

"And thou didst put my father in prison," said another, "for publishing the works of a Continental
novelist; but when the novelist himself comes here, thou puttest him in the place of honour."

I was fast growing overwhelmed with shame.
