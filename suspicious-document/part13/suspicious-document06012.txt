 1646 For many years after the passing of the Act (1 Edw. VI, c. 14)
      confiscating property devoted to "superstitious uses," the
      corporation and the livery companies were the objects of suspicion
      of holding "concealed lands," i.e. lands held charged for
      superstitious uses, which they had failed to divulge. The
      appointment of a royal commission to search for such lands was
      submitted to the law officers of the city for consideration, 9
      Sept., 1567.—Repertory 16, fo. 276b.

      1588, is preserved among the State Papers (Domestic) at the Public
      Record Office (vol. ccxii, No. 68), and is set out in the Appendix
      to this work. Two other lists, dated 24 July, giving the names of
      the ships (exclusive of pinnaces) are also preserved (State Papers
      Dom., vol. ccxiii, Nos. 15, 16). Each of these lists give the number
      of vessels supplied by the city against the Armada as sixteen ships
      and four pinnaces, or as twenty ships (inclusive of pinnaces). It is
      not clear what was the authority of Stow (Howes’s Chron., p. 743)
      for stating that the city, having been requested to furnish fifteen
      ships of war and 5,000 men, asked for two days to deliberate, and
      then furnished thirty ships and 10,000 men. At the same time there
      does exist a list of "shipps set forth and payde upon ye charge of
      ye city of London, anno 1588" (that is to say, the ships furnished
      by the city for that whole year), and that list contains the names
      of thirty ships, with the number of men on board each vessel and the
      names of the commanders.—State Papers Dom., vol. ccxxxii, fos. 16,
