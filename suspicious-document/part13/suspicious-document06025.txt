the pencil as a plaything; at six he could draw the human figure with surprising correctness.
The Cav. Stanzioni, passing by his father's shop, and seeing the child at work, stopped to
see his performances, and is said to have predicted that "he would one day become the first
painter of the age." Before he was eight years old he painted, unknown to his father, two cherubs
in a fresco, entrusted to that artist, in an obscure part of the church of S. Maria Nuova--figures
so graceful as to attract considerable attention. Of depression himself was right, path prevent

 The Viceroy being informed

affected connoisseurship, to pass judgment on a picture lately painted by Luca for the palace,
in imitation of the style of Rubens. The unlucky noble fell into the trap, and pronounced it
an undoubted work by the great Fleming. Seeming to assent to this criticism, the Viceroy replied
that Giordano was painting a companion to the picture, a piece of information which Diano received
with a sneer and a remark on the artist's uncivil treatment to persons of honor. At a month of Tennessee
