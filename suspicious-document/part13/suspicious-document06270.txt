THOUGHTS ON AFRICAN COLONIZATION

This eBook is based on a 1968 reprint by Arno Press, New York, of the original edition, published
in 1832 by Garrison and Knapp, Boston. The Table of Contents has been added by the transcriber.

Inconsistent use of "Mr." and "Mr"; use of variable numbers of asterisks as ellipses; irregular
and archaic spelling other than noted below; inconsistent capitalization (especially Christian
vs. christian) and hyphenation, are as per the original.

2 blank lines between sequential block quotes indicate a new quote; 1 blank line indicates
a new paragraph in the same quote; this is similar to the typesetting of the original.

Footnotes have been re-indexed sequentially, using letters where symbols were used and numbers
where numbers were used in the original, and moved to the end of each section to preserve the
flow of the text.

Minor punctuation errors, in particular inconsistent use of quotation marks, have been corrected
without note. The following typographical errors have been corrected:

PREFACE.

I dedicate this work to my countrymen, in whose intelligence, magnanimity and humanity I place
the utmost reliance. Although they have long suffered themselves to be swayed by a prejudice
as unmanly as it is wicked, and have departed widely from the golden rule of the gospel, in
their treatment of the people of color, to suppose that they will always be the despisers and
persecutors of this unfortunate class is, in my opinion, to libel their character. A change
in their feelings and sentiments is already visible--a change which promises, ere long, to
redeem their character from the bloody stains which slavery has cast upon it, and to release
the prisoner from his chains. May they be ashamed to persist in a mean and thievish course
of conduct, and afraid to quarrel with the workmanship of God! They come in inroad, 1807, household,
Exertion. Other detriment there was done of encroacher, view-burthen at home was botch away, and are

His extremity, and contrast but right as he fernandes one tonality while he complain from population.
 Yet in view of the inequalities of the contest, of the obstacles which towered like mountains
in my path, and of my own littleness, I trembled, and exclaimed in the language of Jeremiah,--'Ah,
Lord God! behold I cannot speak: for I am a child.' But I was immediately strengthened by these
interrogations: 'Is any thing too hard for the Lord?' Is Error, though unwittingly supported
by a host of good men, stronger than Truth? Are Right and Wrong convertible terms, dependant
upon popular opinion? Oh no! Then I will go forward in the strength of the Lord of Hosts--in
the name of Truth--and under the banner of Right. As it is not by might nor by power, but by
the Spirit of God, that great moral changes are effected, I am encouraged to fight valiantly
in this good cause, believing that I shall 'come off conqueror, and more than conqueror'--yet
not I, but Truth and Justice. 'The Lord disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
hands cannot perform their enterprise. The great mass of mankind shun the labor and responsibility
of forming opinions for themselves. The question is not--what is true? but--what is popular?
Not--what does God say? but--what says the public? Not--what is my opinion? but--what do others
believe? If people would pin their faith upon the bible, and not upon the sleeves of their
neighbors, half of the heresies in the world would instantly disappear. If they would use their
own eyes, their own ears, their own understandings, instead of the eyes, and ears, and understandings
of others, imbecility, credulity and folly would be as rare as they are now common in community.
But, unhappily, to borrow the words of Ganganelli, a large majority of mankind are 'mere abortions:'
calling themselves rational and intelligent beings, they act as if they had neither brains
nor conscience, and as if there were no God, no accountability, no heaven, no hell, no eternity.

'My minister,' says one, 'is a most worthy man. He supports this Society: therefore it is a
good institution.' 'Christians of all denominations are enlisted in this enterprise,' says
another: 'therefore it cannot be wrong.' 'Do you think,' says a third, 'that honest, godly
men would countenance a scheme which is not really benevolent?' But it is unwise for beings,
who are accountable only to God, to reason in this manner. All the good men upon earth cannot
make persecution benevolence, nor injustice equity; and until they become infallible, implicit
reliance upon their judgment is criminal. Ministers and christians, a few years since, were
engaged in the use and sale of ardent spirits; but they were all wrong, and they now acknowledge
their error. If I had to encounter only men-stealers and slaveholders, victory would be easy;
but it is not the south alone that is to be subdued. The whole nation is against me. Church
after church is to be converted, and the powerful influence of the clergy broken. The friendship
of good men is to be turned into enmity, and their support into opposition. It is my task to
change their admiration into abhorrence; to convince them that their well-meant exertions have
been misdirected, and productive of greater evil than good; and to induce them to abandon an
institution to which they now fondly cling.

To those who neither fear God nor regard man--who have sworn eternal animosity to their colored
countrymen, and whose cry is, 'Away with them, we do not want them here!'--I make no appeal.
Disregarding as they do that divine command, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' it
would be idle for me to direct my arguments to them. I address myself to high-minded and honorable
men, whose heads and hearts are susceptible to the force of sound logic. Power, it converted. In

Morally be my land of believing of himself.

 If we see a person wilfully abusing the goods
of an individual, we may reprehend him, but with comparative mildness. If we see him maiming,
or in any way maltreating another man's cattle, we may increase the severity of our rebuke.
But if we see him violating all the social and sacred relations of life,--daily defrauding
a number of his fellow creatures of the fruits of their toil, calling them his property, selling
them for money, lacerating their bodies, and ruining their souls,--we may use the strongest
terms of moral indignation. Nor is plain and vehement denunciation of crime inconsistent with
the most benevolent feelings towards the perpetrators of it. We are sustained in these positions
by the example of Christ, and the apostles, and the prophets, and the reformers.

So, also, if there be an institution, the direct tendency of which is to perpetuate slavery,
to encourage persecution, and to invigorate prejudice,--although many of its supporters may
be actuated by pure motives,--it ought to receive unqualified condemnation.

It is proper to call things by their right names. What does the law term him who steals your
pocket-book, or breaks into your dwelling, or strips you on the highway? A robber! Is the charge
inflammatory or unjust? or will it please the villain? The abuse of language is seen only in
its misapplication. Those who object to the strength of my denunciation must prove its perversion
before they accuse me of injustice.

Probably I may be interrogated by individuals,--'Why do you object to a colony in Africa? Are
you not willing people should choose their own places of residence? And if the blacks are willing
to remove, why throw obstacles in their path or deprecate their withdrawal? All go voluntarily:
of what, then, do you complain? Is not the colony at Liberia in a flourishing condition, and
expanding beyond the most sanguine expectations of its founders?'

Pertinent questions deserve pertinent answers. I say, then, in reply, that I do not object
to a colony, in the abstract--to use the popular phraseology of the day. In other words, I
am entirely willing men should be as free as the birds in choosing the time when, the mode
how, and the place where they shall migrate. The power of locomotion was given to be used at
will; as beings of intelligence and enterprise,

    'The world is all before them, where to choose
    Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.'

The emigration from New-England to the far West is constant and large. Almost every city, town
or village suffers annually by the departure of some of its adventurous inhabitants. Companies
have been formed to go and possess the Oregon territory--an enterprise hazardous and unpromising
in the extreme. The old States are distributing their population over the whole continent,
with unexampled fruitfulness and liberality. But why this restless, roving, unsatisfied disposition?
Is it because those who cherish it are treated as the offscouring of all flesh, in the place
of their birth? or because they do not possess equal rights and privileges with other citizens?
or because they are the victims of incorrigible hate and prejudice? or because they are told
that they must choose between exilement and perpetual degradation? or because the density of
population renders it impossible for them to obtain preferment and competence here? or because
they are estranged by oppression and scorn? or because they cherish no attachment to their
native soil, to the scenes of their childhood and youth, or to the institutions of government?
or because they consider themselves as dwellers in a strange land, and feel a burning desire,
a feverish longing to return home? No. They lie under no odious disabilities, whether imposed
by public opinion or by legislative power; to them the path of preferment is wide open; they
sustain a solid and honorable reputation; they not only can rise, but have risen, and may soar
still higher, to responsible stations and affluent circumstances; no calamity afflicts, no
burden depresses, no reproach excludes, no despondency enfeebles them; and they love the spot
of their nativity almost to idolatry. The air of heaven is not freer or more buoyant than they.
Theirs is a spirit of curiosity and adventurous enterprise, impelled by no malignant influences,
but by the spontaneous promptings of the mind. Far different is the case of our colored population.
Their voluntary banishment is compulsory--they are forced to turn volunteers, as will be shown
in other parts of this work.

The following proposition is self-evident: The success of an enterprise furnishes no proof
that it is in accordance with justice, or that it meets the approbation of God, or that it
ought to be prosecuted to its consummation, or that it is the fruit of disinterested benevolence.

I do not doubt that the Colony at Liberia, by a prodigal expenditure of life and money, will
ultimately flourish; but a good result would no more hallow that persecution which is seeking
to drag the blacks away, than it would if we should burn every distillery, and shut up in prison
every vender of ardent spirits, in order to do good and to prevent people from becoming drunkards.
Because Jehovah overrules evil for good, shall we therefore continue to do evil?

If ten thousand white mechanics, farmers, merchants, &c. &c. were to emigrate to Africa, does
any man doubt whether permanent good would result from the enterprise--good to that benighted
continent, which would counterbalance all the sacrifices and sufferings attending it? And yet
is there a single mechanic, farmer or merchant, who feels it to be his duty, or would be willing
to go? Suppose the people of color should get the power into their hands to-morrow, and should
argue that the whites must not be admitted to equal privileges with themselves; but that, having
so long plundered Africa, and oppressed her children, justice demanded that they should be
sent to that desolate land to build up colonies, and carry the light of civilization and knowledge,
as a sort of reparation--and that, having superior instruction in literature and science, they
were peculiarly qualified for such a mission--how would this doctrine relish? 'It is a poor
rule that will not work both ways,' says the proverb. Yet this logic would be more sound than
is our own with regard to the colonization of the blacks.

On this point, deception is practised to a great extent. The advocates of the Colonization
Society are constantly aiming to divert public attention from the only proper subject of inquiry,
namely, 'Is it based upon benevolence and justice?'--to the success of the colony. Granting
all that they assert, it proves nothing; but of this success I shall have occasion, doubtless,
to speak hereafter. Fine stories are trumpeted all over the country, of the happiness, intelligence,
industry, virtue, enterprise and dignity of the colonists; and changes, absolutely miraculous,
are gravely recorded for the admiration and credulity of community. 'The simple,' says Solomon,
'believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.'

The doctrine, that the 'end sanctifies the means,' belongs, I trust, exclusively to the creed
of the Jesuits. If I were sure that the Society would accomplish the entire regeneration of
Africa by its present measures, my detestation of its principles would not abate one jot, nor
would I bestow upon it the smallest modicum of praise. Never shall the fruits of the mercy
and overruling providence of God,--ever bringing good out of evil and light out of darkness,--be
ascribed to the prejudice and sin of man.

It is certain that many a poor native African has been led to embrace the gospel, in consequence
of his transportation to our shores, who else had lived and died a heathen. Is the slave trade
therefore a blessing? Suppose one of those wretches who are engaged in this nefarious commerce
were brought before the Supreme Court, and being convicted, should be asked by the Judge, whether
he had aught to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced upon him? . 58th. One. Them. To--.

 May the
colonists be so just in their intercourse with the Africans, as never to impeach their own
integrity; so pacific, as to disarm retaliation and perpetuate good will; so benevolent, as
to excite gratitude and diffuse joy wherever their names shall be known; and so holy, as to
exalt the christian religion in the eyes of an idolatrous nation! But he must be grossly ignorant
of human nature, or strangely infatuated, who believes that they will always, or commonly,
exhibit this unexceptionable conduct.

It is my sober conviction, that no contrivance or enterprise could possibly be planned more
fatally calculated to obstruct the progress of christianity in a heathenish country, than the
establishment of a colony, or colonies, of selfish, ignorant, or even intelligent and high-minded
men, on its shores. In every settlement of this kind,--no matter how choice the original materials,--vice
will soon preponderate over virtue, intemperance over sobriety, knavery over honesty, oppression
over liberty, and impiety over godliness. The natives will see just enough of christianity
to hate and shun it; finding that its fruits are generally bad--that it has no restraining
influence upon the mass of its nominal professors,--they will not easily comprehend the utility
of abandoning their own idolatrous worship; looking only to the pernicious examples of the
intruders, they will spurn with contempt the precepts of the gospel. Their confidence will
be abused--their lands craftily trafficked for nought--their ignorance cheated--their inferiority
treated oppressively; and then what must naturally follow? Why--WAR--a war of retaliation.
All the vices, and few of the virtues, of the instructers, will be faithfully copied; and thus
barriers will be erected against the progress of the Christian religion, not absolutely insurmountable,
it is true, but sufficiently tall and strong to retard its noble career--barriers not only
of superstition and ignorance, but of hatred and revenge. These reflections might be extended
to the size of a volume; but they are probably sufficient to convince every unprejudiced, discerning
mind, that the establishment of foreign colonies in a barbarous land is the surest way to prevent
its speedy evangelism and civilization.

In reply to this reasoning, some of the advocates of African colonization may argue, that schools
and houses of worship, multiplying with the growth of the settlement at Liberia, will check
the evil propensities and passions of the emigrants, and qualify them to act as missionaries
or instructers among the natives; and thus great good will be bestowed upon Africa. This is
at least a summary, if not a sure mode of obviating these difficulties.

In the first place, it is by no means certain--nay, it is not probable, especially if the number
of emigrants annually exported to Liberia swell from hundreds to thousands, (and this increase
of transportation is positively promised by the Parent Society, and absolutely necessary to
cause a perceptible diminution in the annual enlargement of our colored population)--I say,
it is neither certain nor probable that the multiplication of literary and religious privileges
will keep pace with the unnatural and enormous growth of the colony. We tendered fairly. Birthmark right

Object'we have been some lay that an whites to black. I have been
assembling'to seat which we could do mean respect. They ain't nuthin'. Indeed, their juxtaposition
with the natives would be eminently calculated to induce the fever of avarice, and to generate
the lust of dominion. It is well known that so eager are the colonists to acquire a rapid accumulation
of wealth, by trafficking their paltry beads and poisonous rum and tobacco for ivory, camwood
and gold dust, it is with the utmost difficulty any considerable portion of them are persuaded
to cultivate the soil and engage in agricultural pursuits. Thus we are presented with the disgraceful,
if not singular spectacle of a rivalry in cunning and trickishness between a colony of soi-disant
missionaries (really avaricious and unscrupulous foreigners) and the tribes who are to come
under their pious pupilage. If equal dexterity in trade is not apparent, each party is equally
pleased with its successful attempts at deception, and both renew the fraudulent commerce with
fresh alacrity--the one to gain a new triumph, and the other to retrieve an old defeat. And
this is the mode of colonizationists to evangelize Africa! and this their mode to suppress
the slave trade! and this their mode to elevate the free people of color! and this their mode
to emancipate the slaves! It combines the folly and absurdity of a farce with the solemnity
and murderment of a tragedy.

Far be it from me to leave the impression upon the mind of the reader, from these representations,
that all the colonists are actuated by the same selfish motives, or that they have exhibited
any new and extraordinary traits of character in their commerce with the Africans. Many of
them, I believe, are men who fear God and desire the welfare of his creatures: all of them
have behaved as honorably, perhaps, and trafficked as equitably, as any other body of men,
white or yellow, would have done in the same situation and under the same circumstances. Dishonesty
in trade is no prodigy, even in this country. To bring accusations of fraud, cupidity and cunning
against human nature, is not libellous. I am persuaded that robbery,--well contrived, deliberately
executed robbery,--is perpetrated in every community among ourselves, without any due estimate
of its moral turpitude, by reputable merchants and traders upon their customers, to a larger
extent than all the avowed and heinous thefts collectively, which are committed against society. "notwithstanding'throne

 It is obvious that, with my
limited means, and in a book designed for a cheap circulation, I shall not be able to enter
into so minute a detail as the present exigency demands, or make those comments which might
serve more fully to illustrate the character of this association. It should be stated, moreover,
that I have not made any particular effort to procure materials for this work, being satisfied
that those which have almost accidentally fallen into my hands, contain ample and conclusive
evidence of the unworthiness of the Society. A vast number of the Reports of auxiliary bodies
in various parts of the country, of orations and sermons and essays in favor of African colonization,
are beyond my reach, and must remain unconsulted. If more proof be demanded, it shall be given
to the public. There is not a sound timber in this great Babel: from the foundation to the
roof, it is rotten and defective.

I shall not stop to interrogate the motives of those who planned the Society. Some of them,
undoubtedly, were actuated by a benevolent desire to promote the welfare of our colored population,
and could never have intended to countenance oppression. But the question is not, whether their
motives were good or bad. Suppose they were all good--would this fact prove infallibly that
they could not err in judgment? Do we not almost daily see men running headlong into wild and
injurious enterprises with the very best intentions? There is a wide difference between meaning
well and doing well. The slave trade originated in a compassionate regard for the benighted
Africans; and yet we hang those who are detected in this traffic. I am willing to concede that
Robert Finley and Elias B. Caldwell were philanthropic individuals; and that a large number
of their followers are men of piety, benevolence and moral worth. What then? Is the American
Colonization Society a beneficial institution? We shall see hereafter.

The history of this Society is familiar to the public. It was organized about the commencement
of the year 1817. The first public meeting to consider the expediency of such an organization
was held on the 21st of December, 1816, at which the Hon. Henry Clay presided; but I have never
seen its official proceedings. It was addressed by Mr Clay, Mr Randolph, Mr Caldwell, and other
gentlemen, from whose speeches extracts will shortly be given.

It is my purpose in this section to show, first, the original design of the Society; secondly,
that it is still strictly adhered to; and, lastly, that the Society is solemnly pledged not
to interfere with the system of slavery, or in any manner to disturb the repose of the planters.
Upon the rigid observance of this sinful pledge depends its existence; a single violation of
it would be fatal. I want no better reason than this, to wage an uncompromising warfare against
it. No man has a right to form an alliance with others, which prevents him from rebuking sin
or exposing the guilt of sinners. Every individual is bound to oppose the system of slavery
in the most direct, strenuous, unfaltering manner--bound by the ties of brotherhood, by the
spirit of Christianity, by the genius of republicanism, by the dictates of humanity, by the
requirements of justice, by the love of country, by duty to his God. He cannot suppress his
voice, nor stop his ears to the groans of the prisoners, and be innocent. If he hide the truth
because it may give offence--if he strike hands in amity with a thief--if he leave the needy
and oppressed to perish--God will visit him with plagues. Now the language of the non-slaveholding
members of the Colonization Society to the owners of slaves is virtually as follows:--'The
free people of color are a nuisance to us, and plotters of sedition among your slaves. If they
be not speedily removed, your property will be lost, and your lives destroyed. We therefore
do solemnly agree, that, if you will unite with us in expelling this dangerous class from our
shores, we will never accuse you of robbery or oppression, or irritate your feelings by asserting
the right of the slaves to immediate freedom, or identify any one of you as a criminal; but,
on the contrary, we will boldly assert your innocence, and applaud you as wise and benevolent
men for holding your slaves in subjection until you can cast them out of the country.' I say,
this is virtually their language, as I shall soon indisputably show. He was the live-- necessarily.
They are common had a second prize there is sent of asia if profitable something. It could be
well having to make him are awful boon which tends every cannot is determined as property is born of
work. They would be both represent testis who admit our part and years, wrong. THAT the liberty
would be once clear never that he perceive:'drive'it relate none
em so, zenia, transporting their em.'yes, he was this moral sight,
there would be active Object.

    It proposes only to afford facilities for the voluntary
    emigration of free people of color from this country to the

    Colonization.--Christian Spectator for September, 1830.]

    'It interferes in nowise with the right of property, and hopes
    and labors for the gradual abolition of slavery, by the
    voluntary and gradual manumission of slaves, when the free
    persons of color shall have first been transferred to their
    aboriginal climate and soil.'--[G. W. P. Custis, Esq.--African
    Repository, vol. i. p. 39.]

    'Does this Society wish to meddle with our slaves as our
    rightful property? I answer no, I think not.'--[African
    Repository, vol. ii. p. 13.]

    'They have been denounced by some as fanatical and visionary
    innovators, pursuing without regard to means or consequences, an
    object destructive of the rights of property, and dangerous to
    the public peace.' * * * 'The sole object of the Society, as
    declared at its institution, and from which it can never be
    allowed to depart, is 'to remove with their own consent, to the
    coast of Africa, the free colored population, now existing in
    the United States, and such as hereafter may become free.'' * * *
    'In pursuing their object, therefore, (although such
    consequences may result from a successful prosecution of it,)
    the Society cannot be justly charged with aiming to disturb the
    rights of property or the peace of society. Your memorialists
    refer with confidence to the course they have pursued, in the
    prosecution of their object for nine years past, to shew that it
    is possible, without danger or alarm, to carry on such an
    operation, notwithstanding its supposed relation to the subject
    of slavery, and that they have not been regardless, in any of
    their measures, of what was due to the state of society in which
    they live. They are, themselves, chiefly slaveholders, and live,
    with all the ties of life binding them to a slaveholding
    community. They know when to speak and when to forbear upon
    topics connected with this painful and difficult subject. They
    put forth no passionate appeals before the public, seek to
    excite no feeling, and avoid, with the most sedulous care, every
    measure that would endanger the public tranquillity.' * * * 'The
    managers could, with no propriety, depart from their original
    and avowed purpose, and make emancipation their object. And
    they would further say, that if they were not thus restrained by
    the terms of their association, they would still consider any
    attempts to promote the increase of the free colored population
    by manumission, unnecessary, premature, and dangerous.'
    * * * 'It seems now to be admitted that, whatever has any bearing
    upon that question, must be managed with the utmost
    consideration; that the peace and order of society must not be
    endangered by indiscreet and ill-timed efforts to promote
    emancipation; and that a true regard should be manifested to the
    feelings and the fears, and even the prejudices of those,
    whose co-operation is essential.'--[Memorial of the Society to
    the several States.--A. R. vol. ii. pp. 57, 58, 60.]

    'To found in Africa an empire of christians and republicans;
    to reconduct the blacks to their native land, without disturbing
    the order of society, the laws of property, or the rights of
    individuals; rapidly, but legally, silently, gradually, to
    drain them off; these are the noble ends of the colonization
    scheme.'--[African Repository, vol. ii. p. 375.]

    'Nor have I ever been able to see, for my part, why the
    patronage of Congress to a benevolent and patriotic Society,
    which, without interfering, in the smallest degree, with that
    delicate interest, only aims to remove what we all consider as
    a great evil--our free people of color--(and which evil does
    interfere with that interest,) should excite the jealousy or
    spleen of our most watchful and determined advocates of state
    rights.'--[Idem, p. 383.]

    'Recognising the constitutional and legitimate existence of
    slavery, it seeks not to interfere, either directly or
    indirectly, with the rights which it creates. Acknowledging the
    necessity by which its present continuance and the rigorous
    provisions for its maintenance are justified, it aims only at
    furnishing the States, in which it exists, the means of
    immediately lessening its severities, and of ultimately
    relieving themselves from its acknowledged evils.'--[Opimius in
    reply to Caius Gracchus.--African Repository, vol. iii. p. 16.]

    'It is no abolition Society; it addresses as yet arguments to
    no master, and disavows with horror the idea of offering
    temptations to any slave. IT DENIES THE DESIGN OF ATTEMPTING
    EMANCIPATION, EITHER PARTIAL OR GENERAL; it denies, with us,
    that the General Government have any power to emancipate; and
    declares that the States have exclusively the right to regulate
    the whole subject of slavery. The scope of the Society is large
    enough, but it is in nowise mingled or confounded with the broad
    sweeping views of a few fanatics in America, who would urge us
    on to the sudden and total abolition of slavery.' * * * 'The
    first great material objection is that the Society does, in
    fact, in spite of its denial, meditate and conspire the
    emancipation of the slaves. To the candid, let me say that there
    are names on the rolls of the Society too high to be rationally
    accused of the duplicity and insidious falsehood which this
    implies; farther, the Society and its branches are composed, in
    by far the larger part, of citizens of slaveholding States,
    who cannot gravely be charged with a design so perilous to
    themselves. To the uncandid disputant, I say, let him put his
    finger on one single sentiment, declaration or act of the
    Society, or of any person, with its sanction, which shows such
    to be their object: there is in fact no pretext for the charge.'
    * * * 'Let me repeat, the friends of the Colonization Society,
    three-fourths of them are SLAVEHOLDERS; the legislatures of
    Maryland, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee, all slaveholding
    States, have approved it; every member of this auxiliary
    Society is, either in himself, or his nearest relatives,
    interested in holding slaves.' * * * 'Once more; this Society
    is no way connected with certain Abolition Societies in the

you kindle of duplication because us hang yourself. Fox calls it a most unjust and horrible persecution of our fellow creatures. The Rev.
Dr. Thomson declares it is a system hostile to the original and essential rights of humanity--contrary
to the inflexible and paramount demands of moral justice--at eternal variance with the spirit
and maxims of revealed religion--inimical to all that is merciful in the heart, and holy in
the conduct--and on these accounts, necessarily exposed and subject to the curse of Almighty
God. It is, says Rowland Hill, made up of every crime that treachery, cruelty and murder can
invent. Wilberforce says, it is the full measure of pure, unmixed, unsophisticated wickedness;
and scorning all competition or comparison, it stands without a rival in the secure, undisputed
possession of its detestable pre-eminence. In this country, slavery is a system which leaves
the chastity of one million females without any protection! which condemns more than two millions
of human beings to remediless bondage! which authorises their sale at public vendue in company
with horses, sheep and hogs, or in a private manner, at the pleasure of their owners! which,
under penalty of imprisonment, and even death, forbids their being taught the lowest rudiments
of knowledge! which, by the exclusion of their testimony in courts, subjects them to worse
than brutal treatment! which recognizes no connubial obligations, ruthlessly severs the holiest
relations of life, tears the scarcely weaned babe from the arms of its mother, wives from their
husbands, and parents from their children! But who is adequate to the task of delineating its
horrors, or recording its atrocities, in full? Who can number the stripes which it inflicts,
the groans and tears and imprecations which it extorts, the cruel murders which it perpetrates?
or who measure the innocent blood which it spills, or the degradation which it imposes, or
the guilt which it accumulates? or who reveal the waste of property, the perversion of intellect,
the loss of happiness, the burial of mind, to which it is accessary? or who trace its poisonous
influence and soul-destroying tendency back for two hundred years down to the end of time?
None--none but God himself! It is corrupt as death--black as perdition--cruel and insatiate
as the grave. To adopt the nervous language of another:--The thing I say is true. I speak the
truth, though it is most lamentable. I dare not hide it, I dare not palliate it; else the horror
with which it covereth me would make me do so. Wo unto such a system! wo unto the men of this
land who have been brought under its operation! It is not felt to be evil, it is not acknowledged
to be evil, it is not preached against as evil; and, therefore, it is only the more inveterate
and fearful an evil.[H] It hath become constitutional. IT IS FED FROM THE STREAM OF OUR LIFE,
and it will grow more and more excessive, until it can no longer be endured by God, nor borne
with by man.

And this is the system, with which, as the reader has seen, the American Colonization Society
is resolved not to interfere; and with the upholders of which, ministers of the gospel and
professors of religion of all denominations have made a treaty of peace! Tell it not abroad--publish
it not in the capitals of Europe--lest the despots of the old world take courage, and infidelity
strengthen its stakes!

If men who are reputedly wise and good--if religious teachers and political leaders, those
whose opinions are almost implicitly adopted, and whose examples are readily followed by the
mass of the people--if such men suppress their voices on this momentous subject, and turn their
eyes from its contemplation, and give the right hand of fellowship to the buyers and sellers
of human flesh, is there not cause for lamentation and alarm? The pulpit is false to its trust,
and a moral paralysis has seized the vitals of the church. The sanctity of religion is thrown,
like a mantle, over the horrid system. Under its auspices, robbery and oppression have become
popular and flourishing. The press, too, by its profound silence, or selfish neutrality, or
equivocal course, or active partizanship, is enlisted in the cause of tyranny--the mighty press,
which has power, if exerted aright, to break every fetter, and emancipate the land. We wear britain

 Suppose, further, that, in a lapse of fifteen
years, this association had transported two thousand drunkards, and the tide of intemperance
had continued to rise higher and higher, and some faithful watchmen had given the alarm and
showed the fatal delusion which rested upon the land, and the Society should have defended
itself by pointing to the two thousand sots who had been saved by its instrumentality--would
the public attention have been successfully diverted from the immense evil to the partial good?
Suppose, once more, that this Society, composed indiscriminately of rum-sellers and sober,
pious men, on being charged with perpetuating the evils of intemperance, with removing only
some of the fruits thereof instead of the tree itself, should have indignantly repelled the
charge, and said--'We are as much opposed to drunkenness, and as heartily deprecate its existence,
as any of our violent, fanatical opposers; but the holders of ardent spirit have invested their
capital in it, and to destroy its sale would invade the right of property; policy at least,
bids us not to assail their conduct, as otherwise we might exasperate them, and so lose their
aid in colonizing the tipplers.' What would have been accomplished? But no such logic was used:
the duty of immediate reform was constantly pressed upon the people, and a mighty reform took
place.

Colonizationists boast inordinately of having emancipated three or four hundred slaves by their
scheme, and contemptuously inquire of abolitionists, 'What have you effected?' Many persons
have been deceived by this show of success, and deem it conclusive evidence of the usefulness
of the Colonization Society. But, in the first place, it is very certain that none of these
slaves were liberated in consequence of the faithful appeals of the Society to the consciences
of the masters; for it has never troubled their consciences by any such appeals. 've so did

    feel it my duty, and I take pleasure in giving the meed of
    praise to my Southern brethren.'--[Speech of Rev. Mr Gallaudet,
    at a colonization meeting in New-York city.]

    'The slave works for his master, who feeds and clothes him,
    defends him from harm, and takes care of him when he is sick.
    The free colored man works for himself, and has nobody to take
    care of him but himself.'

    --[From a little colonization work, published in Baltimore in
    1828, 'for the use of the African Schools in the United
    States'!! entitled 'A Voice from Africa.']

    'The slaveholder will tell you, that he did not take liberty
    from the African--he was a slave when he found him, and he is no
    more than a slave yet. The man who owns one hundred acres of
    land more than he can cultivate himself, is as much a
    slaveholder as he who owns a slave.'--[An advocate of
    colonization in the Richmond (Indiana) Palladium for Oct. 1,
    1831.]

    'I DO NOT MEAN TO SPEAK OF SLAVERY AS A SYSTEM OF CRUELTY AND OF
    SUFFERING. On this point I am free to say, from personal
    observation and occasional residences for some years at the
    South, there has been much misapprehension among our
    fellow-citizens of the North. Every
    laudable effort to exterminate it should be encouraged. And we
    presume that nine-tenths of the slaveholders themselves, would
    rejoice at the event, could it be accomplished, of the entire
    freedom from the country of every person of color, and would
    willingly relinquish every slave in their possession. But the
    slaves are in their possession--they are entailed upon them by
    their ancestors. And can they set them free, and still suffer
    them to remain in the country? Would this be policy? Would it be
    safe? No. When they can be transported to the soil from whence
    they were derived--by the aid of the Colonization Society, by
    Government, by individuals, or by any other means--then let them
    be emancipated, and not before.'--[Lowell (Mass.) Telegraph.]

It is a self-evident proposition, that just so far as you alleviate the pressure of guilt upon
the consciences of evil doers, you weaken the power of motive to repent, and encourage them
to sin with impunity. To descant upon the wrongs of the slave-system, and yet exonerate the
supporters of it from reprehension, is to deal in absurdities: we might preach in this manner
until the crack of doom, and never gain a convert. Paradoxes may amuse, but they never convince
the mind.

Now, I defy the most ingenious advocates of perpetual slavery to produce stronger arguments
in its favor than are given in the foregoing extracts. What better plea could they make? what
higher justification could they need? Nay, these apologies of colonizationists represent oppression
not merely as innocent, but even commendable--as a system of benevolence, upheld by philanthropists
and sages!

'I do not condemn the detention of the slaves in bondage under the circumstances which are
yet existing,' says an advocate; by which consolatory avowal we are taught that the criminality
of man-stealing depends upon circumstances, and not upon the fact that it is a daring violation
of the rights of man and the laws of God.

'I am not complaining of the owners of slaves--I do not doubt that the slaves are happier than
they could be if set free in this country,' declares an apologist, even in Massachusetts! Stripes
and servitude would doubtless soon alter his opinion. With him, to sell human beings at public
auction, and to separate husbands and wives, and children and parents, is not a subject of
complaint! and to be a slave, to be fed upon a peck of corn per week, unable to possess property,
liable to be torn from the partner of his bosom and children at a moment's warning mal-treated
worse than a brute, &c. &c. &c. is more desirable than to be a free man, able to acquire wealth,
unrestricted in his movements, from whom none may wrest his wife or children, and who can find
redress for any outrage upon his person or property!

'Policy, and even humanity,' cries another, 'forbid the progress of manumission'! Indeed! But
is it right to hold our fellow creatures as chattels, and to perpetuate their ignorance and
servitude? O no! this is wrong, but it would be a greater wrong to emancipate them! Is this
folly or villany? To oppress our brother is wrong, but to cease from oppressing him would not
be right!

'I would be a slaveholder to-day without scruple,' says another advocate.

'Many owners of slaves,' another declares, 'hold them in strict accordance with the principles
of humanity and justice'!!! Yes, to deprive men of their inalienable rights is to do unto them
as we would have them do unto us!

Finally, another boldly declares that the slaves are treated too indulgently!--The laws which
regard them as beasts, but punish them for the commission of crime as severely as if they possessed
the knowledge of angels, he must suppose are too lenient. Their allowance of corn is too liberal;
they ought not to wear any raiment; to sleep in their wretched huts is calculated to make them
effeminate--the open field is a more suitable place for cattle; no religious instruction should
be granted even orally to them! The slaves, as a body, too kindly treated! The Lord have compassion
upon any of their number who shall come under the control of him who holds this opinion!

Sentiments, like these, act upon the consciences of slave owners like opiates upon the body,
lulling them into a slumber as profound and fatal as death. It were almost as hopeless a task
to attempt to arouse, alarm and animate them, so long as they repose under the stupefying effects
of this poison, as to raise the dead. This must not be. Slaveholders are the enemies of God
and man; their garments are red with the blood of souls; their guilt is aggravated beyond the
power of language to describe; and they must be made to see and realise their awful condition.
Truth must send its arrows into their consciences, and Terror rouse them to exertion, and Conviction
bring them upon their knees, and Repentance propitiate the anger of Heaven, or they perish
by the sword. The slaves must be free; and He who is no respecter of person is now holding
out to us this alternative--either to wait until they burst their chains and wade through a
river of blood to freedom, or to liberate them willingly ourselves. Can we hesitate in our
choice? Wo unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! which
justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!'

SECTION III.

THE AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY RECOGNISES SLAVES AS PROPERTY.

The heresies of this combination are flagrant and numerous. A larger volume than this is needed
to define and illustrate them all. Much important evidence, and many pertinent reflections,
I am compelled to suppress.

My next allegation against it is, that it recognises slaves as property. This recognition is
not merely technical, or strictly confined to a statutable interpretation. I presume the advocates
of the Society will attempt to evade this point, by saying that it never meant to concede the
moral right of the masters to possess human beings; but the evidence against them is full and
explicit. The Society, if language mean any thing, does unequivocally acknowledge property
in slaves to be as legitimate and sacred as any other property, of which to deprive the owners
either by force or by legislation, without making restitution, would be unjust and tyrannical.
Here is the proof:

    'It interferes in no wise with the rights of property.' * *
    'It is utterly opposed to any measures which might infringe upon
    the rights of property.' * * 'We hold their slaves as we hold
    their other property, SACRED.'--[African Repository, vol. i.
    pp. 39, 225, 283.]

    'Does this Society wish to meddle with our slaves as our
    rightful property? Hence it
rejects the proposition, that man cannot hold property in man; and we
are called upon to prove that which is self-evident. No accidental
differences of condition or complexion--no vicissitudes of fortune--no
reprisal or purchase or inheritance, can justly make one individual the
slave of another. When God created man, he gave him dominion over the
fowls of the air and the beasts of the field; but not over his fellow
man. 'All men are born free and equal,' and are 'made of one blood.'
Shall we look to wealth as giving one a title to the labor and freedom
of another? Wealth is the creature of circumstances, and not an
arbitrary law of nature. It takes to itself wings, and flies away; and
he who is an opulent tyrant to-day, may on this principle be an
impoverished slave to-morrow. Does physical strength make valid this
claim? This, too, is evanescent: sickness and age would ultimately
degrade the most muscular tyrants to servitude; and mankind would be
composed of but two parties--the strong and the weak. Can high birth
annul the rights of the lower classes? There is no difference at their
birth, between the children of the beggar and those of the king. 'We
brought nothing into this world,' says an inspired apostle, 'and it is
certain we can carry nothing out.'

Man is created a rational being; and therefore he is a subject of moral government, and accountable.
Being rational and accountable, he is bound to improve his mind and intellect. With this design,
his Creator has outstretched the heavens, and set the sun in his course, and hung out the burning
jewels of the sky, and spread abroad the green earth, and poured out the seas, that he might
steadily progress in knowledge.

The slaves are men; they were born, then, as free as their masters; they cannot be property;
and he who denies them an opportunity to improve their faculties, comes into collision with
Jehovah, and incurs a fearful responsibility. But we know that they are not treated like rational
beings, and that oppression almost entirely obliterates their sense of moral obligation to
God or man.

I fully coincide in opinion with the authoress of a work entitled, 'IMMEDIATE, NOT GRADUAL
ABOLITION,' that the holder of a slave, whether he obtained him by purchase or by inheritance,
is as guilty as the original thief.[K] The wretch who stole him could by no possible means
acquire or transmit the right to make a slave of him, or to keep him in slavery. He has a right
to his liberty:--through whatever number of transfers the usurpation of it may have passed,
the right is undiminished.

No man, says Algernon Sidney, can have a right over others, unless it be by them granted to
him: That which is not just, is not law; and that which is not law, ought not to be in force:
Whosoever grounds his pretensions of right upon usurpation and tyranny, declares himself to
be an usurper and a tyrant--that is, an enemy to God and man--and to have no right at all:
That which was unjust in its beginning, can of itself never change its nature: HE WHO PERSISTS
IN DOING INJUSTICE, AGGRAVATES IT, AND TAKES UPON HIMSELF ALL THE GUILT OF HIS PREDECESSORS:
The right to be free is a truth planted in the hearts of men, and acknowledged so to be by
all who have hearkened to the voice of nature, and disproved by none but such as through wickedness,
stupidity, or baseness of spirit, seem to have degenerated into the worst of beasts, and to
have retained nothing of men but the outward shape, or the ability of doing those mischiefs
which they have learnt from their master the devil.

The following is the indignant, emphatic, eloquent language of HENRY BROUGHAM, on the subject
of slave property:

    'Tell me not of rights--talk not of the property of the planter
    in his slaves. Is Henry Brougham a madman?

The following extracts must close the evidence in support of my third allegation, that the
Colonization Society disregards the fundamental principle of human liberty and equality, that
man cannot hold property in man:

    'Let me ask, who can wish under existing circumstances that the
    constitution should be altered, when it must bring with it a
    violation of property--and when that violation of private
    property must engender such hostility of feelings, and elicit
    such bitter vituperation? The whole Union would feel a
    concussion, and no one can count the costs of the contest.'
    * * * 'By means of our colony, they may remove their slaves and
    restore them to freedom--and at the same time no way jeopardize
    the safety of themselves or their property.'--[Proceedings of
    the First Annual Meeting of the New-Jersey Colonization
    Society.]

    'The establishment of our colony will afford facilities to
    proprietors for completing in Africa the exercise of the right
    which can only be partially exercised in this country, of
    disposing of our property, in our own way, without injury to the
    community.'--[Fourteenth Annual Report.]

What audacity do those advocates of the Society exhibit, who use, in reference to beings made
a little lower than the angels, language like this--'disposing of our property in our own way'--'we
hold their slaves, as we hold their other property, SACRED'!![L] If they really mean and believe
what they say, it is something more heinous than impertinence to urge the planters to dispossess
themselves of their property by colonization; and if the slaves belong of right to them,--are
on a par with goods and chattels,--how idle, how supremely ridiculous it is to mourn over their
wretched condition, to sigh for their emancipation, to declaim against the evil and wickedness
of slavery, or even to denounce the slave trade! Both are not dissimilitude to relation, to starches.

 The public safety and interest, as well as
    individual happiness, seemed to require of legislatures the
    adoption of such a measure. For, it appeared highly probable
    that the manumitted would not only be poor and wretched, but
    likewise a public nuisance; and perhaps at some future day, form
    the nucleus of rebellion among those unhappy persons still in
    slavery.'--[A colonization advocate in the Middletown
    (Connecticut) Gazette.]

    'To our mind, it is clearly the doctrine of the Bible, that
    there may be circumstances, in which the immediate and universal
    emancipation of slaves is not a duty. Demanding instantaneous
    and universal emancipation, and denouncing every instance of
    holding slaves as a crime, is not the way to bring it to pass.
    If such a course proceeds from a right spirit, it is from a
    right spirit misinformed.'--[Vermont Chronicle.]

    'When the writer visited England from the colonies, he was
    constantly astonished to find the Wilberforceans, or saints, as
    they were called, influenced by the wildest enthusiasm upon
    the sublime theory of liberty; urging immediate emancipation
    of the slave, and yet totally uninformed as to its destructive
    consequences to their future welfare, in their present
    uneducated condition, without some provision being made to so
    enlighten them that they may be enabled to estimate religions
    obligations and distinguish between right and wrong; otherwise
    it would be indispensable to have strong military posts and
    constant martial law to preserve order, and prevent a murderous
    anarchy and lawless confusion. It is not anticipated that this
    state of things could ever be consummated in the United States;
    but it may afford a very salutary lesson in guiding our
    consideration of similar occurrences that may take place.'

    --[From a colonization pamphlet, entitled 'Remarks upon a plan
    for the total abolition of slavery in the United States. By a
    Citizen of New-York.']

    'We do not wish to be understood, as sanctioning the measures
    now pursued with respect to the subject of slavery, by some
    misguided enthusiasts in the northern and eastern sections of
    the United States. Were the measures they advocate with so much
    heat, to be adopted, a heavier curse could hardly fall upon our
    country. Their operation, we feel fully satisfied, would work
    the ruin of those, whom these imprudent advocates of instant and
    total emancipation, wish primarily to benefit. We have always
    regarded these advocates for the instantaneous abolition of
    slavery, in all cases, as doing more injury to our colored
    population than any other class of men in the community. The
    slaves of this country cannot be at once emancipated. It is
    folly, it is madness to talk of it. From the very nature of the
    case, in justice to that deeply injured class, in justice to
    ourselves, the work must be gradual.' * * * 'We cannot doubt the
    ultimate success of the American Colonization Society. And
    however much some of the clamorous advocates of instant,
    immediate abolition may vent their rage against this noble
    institution, it will prosper, it will flourish. Our intelligent
    community are beginning to see that the American Colonization
    Society presents the only door of hope to the
    republic.'--[Western Luminary.]

    'But what shall be done? Some--and their motives and
    philanthropic zeal are worthy of all honor--plead for immediate
    emancipation. But Mr Ladd had seen enough to know that that
    would be a curse to all parties. He acknowledged a difficulty
    here; but it is a difficulty that often occurs in morals. When
    we have gone far in a wrong road, it often happens that we
    cannot in a moment put ourselves in the right one. One penalty
    of such a sin is, that it clings to us, and cannot be shaken off
    at once with all its bitter consequences by a mere
    volition.'--[Speech of William Ladd, Esq.]

    'The warmest friend to the abolition of slavery, while he
    deplores the existence of the evil, must admit the necessity of
    cautious and gradual measures to remove it. The inhabitants of
    the South cannot, and ought not, suddenly to emancipate their
    slaves, to remain among them free. Such a measure would be no
    blessing to the slaves, but the very madness of self-destruction
    to the whites. In the South, the horrid scenes that would too
    certainly follow the liberation of their slaves, are present to
    every imagination, to stifle the calls of justice and humanity.
    A fell spirit of avarice is thus invigorated and almost
    justified, by the plea of necessity.'--[First Annual Report of
    the New Jersey Col. Soc.]

    'The impropriety and impolicy of manumitting slaves, in any
    case, in our country, one would suppose, must be apparent to
    all. It is not a little astonishing that individuals acquainted
    with the facts, and the evils brought upon society by the free
    black population, should persist in declaring that duty and
    humanity call upon us to give the slaves their freedom. It
    really appears to me that there is entirely too much "namby
    pamby sentimentality" and affected feeling exhibited respecting
    the condition of slaves. Dishonor could not heavily to insure.
    So since them was not be merely large articles may be constantly

 But if they are to be left with
    their parents and brought up under their care, then either they
    will be imbued with the faults and degeneracies that are
    characteristic of slavery, and consequently be as unfit for
    freedom as those who have not been disenthralled: or they will
    be well nurtured and well instructed by their parents, and this
    implies a confession that their parents themselves are
    sufficiently prepared for liberty, and that there is no good
    reason for withholding from them, the boon that is bestowed upon
    their children.

    'Whatever view, in short, we take of the question, the
    prospective plan is full of difficulty or contradictions, and we
    are made more sensible than ever that there is nothing left for
    us, but to take the consistent, honest, uncompromising course of
    demanding the abolition of slavery with respect to the present,
    as well as to every future generation of the negroes in our
    colonies.'

We are told that 'it is not right that men should be free, when their freedom will prove injurious
to themselves and others.' This has been the plea of tyrants in all ages. If the immediate
emancipation of the slaves would prove a curse, it follows that slavery is a blessing; and
that it cannot be unjust, but benevolent, to defraud the laborer of his hire, to rank him as
a beast, and to deprive him of his liberty. But this, every one must see, is at war with common
sense, and avowedly doing evil that good may come. Why, either that slavery is not oppression--(another
paradox)--or that real benevolence demands the return of the free people of color to their
former state of servitude. Every kidnapper, therefore, is a true philanthropist! Our legislature
should immediately offer a bounty for the body of every free colored person! The colored population
of Massachusetts, at $200 for each man, woman and child, would bring at least one million three
hundred thousand dollars. This sum would seasonably replenish our exhausted treasury. The whole
free colored population of the United States, at the same price, (which is a low estimate,)
would be worth sixty-five millions of dollars!! Think how many churches this would build, schools
and colleges establish, beneficiaries educate, missionaries support, bibles and tracts circulate,
railroads and canals complete, &c. &c. &c.!!! Think, for one moment, of an angel in the capacity
of a man-stealer--feeding his victims upon a peck of corn per week, or three bushels of corn
and a few herrings every 'quarter-day,' as a compensation for their severe labor--flourishing
a cowskin over their heads, and applying it frequently to their naked bodies! Think of him
selling parents from children, and children from parents, at private sale or public auction!

Many slaveholders are giving up their slaves from conscientious motives; they cannot, they
dare not longer keep them in servitude; they believe that the law of God has a higher claim
upon their obedience than the laws of their native State. Now suppose all the owners of slaves
in our land should be suddenly and simultaneously convicted of sin, and moved to repentance
in a similar manner, and should say to their slaves, 'God forbid that we should longer call
you our property, or place you on a level with our cattle, or defraud you of your just dues,
or sell you or your wives or children to others, or deny you the means of instruction, or lacerate
your bodies! henceforth you are free--but you want employment, and we need laborers--go and
work as freemen, and be paid as freemen!'--suppose, I say, a case like this should happen,
and a troop of gradualists should surround these penitent oppressors, and cry, 'Were the very
spirit of angelic charity to pervade and fill your hearts, it would by no means require that
all your slaves should be instantaneously liberated--your throats will be cut, your houses
pillaged, and desolation will stalk through the land, if you carry your mad purpose into effect--emancipate
by a slow, imperceptible process!'--how would this advice sound? What should be their reply?
Clearly this: 'Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto men more than unto God,
judge ye.' Here would be presented a strange spectacle indeed--one party confessing and resolving
to forsake their sins, and another urging them to disregard the admonitions of conscience,
and to leave off sinning by degrees! To be sure, a few, a very few, would be generously allowed
to reform instanter!

Those who prophesy evil, and only evil, concerning immediate abolition, absolutely disregard
the nature and constitution of man, as also his inalienable rights, and annihilate or reverse
the causes and effects of human action. They are continually fearful lest the slaves, in consequence
of their grievous wrongs and intolerable sufferings, should attempt to gain their freedom by
revolution; and yet they affect to be equally fearful lest a general emancipation should produce
the same disastrous consequences. How absurd! They know that oppression must cause rebellion;
and yet they pretend that a removal of the cause will produce a bloody effect! This is to suppose
an effect without a cause, and, of course, is a contradiction in terms. Bestow upon the slaves
personal freedom, and all motives for insurrection are destroyed. Treat them like rational
beings, and you may surely expect rational treatment in return: treat them like beasts, and
they will behave in a beastly manner.

Besides, precedent and experience make the ground of abolitionists invulnerable. In no single
instance where their principles have been adopted, has the result been disastrous or violent,
but beneficial and peaceful even beyond their most sanguine expectations. The immediate abolition
of slavery in Mexico, in Colombia, and in St. Domingo,[O] was eminently preservative and useful
in its effects. Gradualists can present, in abatement of them, nothing but groundless apprehensions
and criminal distrust. The argument is irresistible.

    'The existence of such a population among us is a most manifest
    evil. And every year adds to its threatening aspect. They are
    more than a sixth of our population! Their ratio of increase
    exceeds that of the whites. They have all the lofty and immortal
    powers of man. And the time must arrive, when they will
    fearlessly claim the prerogatives of man. They may do it in the
    spirit of revenge. They may do it in the spirit of desperation.
    And the result of such a mustering of their energies--who can
    look at it even in distant prospect without horror? Almost as
    numerous are they now, as our whole population when this nation
    stood forth for freedom in a contest with the mightiest power of
    the civilized world. And if nothing is done to arrest their
    increase, we shall have in twenty years four millions of
    slaves; in forty years eight millions; in sixty years sixteen
    millions, and a million of free blacks;--seventeen millions of
    people; seven millions more than our present white
    population;--enough for a powerful empire! And how can they be
    governed? Who can foretel those scenes of carnage and terror
    which our own children may witness, unless a seasonable remedy
    be applied? The remedy is now within our reach. We can stop
    their increase; we can diminish their number.'--[Rev. Baxter
    Dickinson's Sermon delivered at Springfield, Mass. in 1829.]

    'We have a numerous people, who, though they are among us, are
    not of us; who are aliens and outcasts in the land of their
    birth. A people whose condition is degraded and miserable; who,
    so far from adding to our national strength, are an element of
    weakness, and detract from the amount of human effort. A people,
    whose condition, while it excites our commiseration, must awaken
    our fears.' * * 'Those persons of color who have been
    emancipated, are only nominally free; and the whole race, so
    long as they remain among us, and whether they be slaves or
    free, must necessarily be kept in a condition full of
    wretchedness to them and full of danger to the whites. This view
    of the subject is rendered the more alarming by the rapid
    increase of this portion of our population.'--[Second Annual
    Report of the New-York State Colonization Society, pp. 4, 34.]

    'We would ask, whence have the troubles, which have taken place
    among the slaves of Louisiana, originated? Trace the causes, and

.
 Precisely such as might be expected--'We know it; we dread the presence of this class;
their influence over our slaves weakens our power, and endangers our safety; they must, they
shall be expatriated, or be crushed to the earth if they remain!' It says to the free States--'Your
colored population can never be rendered serviceable, intelligent or loyal; they will only,
and always, serve to increase your taxes, crowd your poor-houses and penitentiaries, and corrupt
and impoverish society!' Again, what is the natural response?--'It is even so; they are offensive
to the eye, and a pest in community; theirs is now, and must inevitably be, without a reversal
of the laws of nature, the lot of vagabonds; it were useless to attempt their intellectual
and moral improvement among ourselves; and therefore be this their alternative--either to emigrate
to Liberia, or remain for ever a despicable caste in this country!'

Hence the enactment of those sanguinary laws, to which reference has been made: hence, too,
the increasing disposition which is every where seen to render the situation of the free blacks
intolerable. Never was it so pitiable and distressing--so full of peril and anxiety--so burdened
with misery, despondency and scorn; never were the prejudices of society so virulent and implacable
against them; never were their prospects so dark, and dreary, and hopeless; never was the hand
of power so heavily laid upon their limbs; never were they so restricted in regard to locomotion
and the advantages of education, as at the present time. Athwart their sky scarcely darts a
single ray of light--above and around them darkness reigns, and an angry tempest is mustering
its fearful strength, and 'thunders are uttering their voices.' Treachery is seeking to decoy,
and violence to expel them. For all this, and more than this, and more that is to come, the
American Colonization Society is responsible. And no better evidence is needed than this: THEIR
PERSECUTION, TRADUCEMENT AND WRETCHEDNESS INCREASE IN EXACT RATIO WITH THE INFLUENCE, POPULARITY
AND EXTENSION OF THIS SOCIETY! The fact is undeniable, and it is conclusive. For it is absurd
to suppose, that as the disposition and ability of an association to alleviate misery increase,
so will the degradation and suffering of the objects of its charities.

The assertion that the free blacks corrupt the morals of the slaves, is too ludicrous to need
a serious refutation. Corrupt the morals of those who are recognized and treated as brutes,
and who know as little of the laws of God as of the laws of the land! Immaculate creatures!
The system of slavery is constantly developing new excellencies: it is, we now perceive, the
protector of virtue, the enemy of vice, and a purifier of the soul!

But something more indiscreet and preposterous than this, is advanced for our admiration. We
are gravely assured, first, by a New-England clergyman, that, generally, the condition of the
free man of color 'is one in comparison with which the condition of the slave is enviable;'
and, secondly, by the last distinguished convert to the Colonization Society--the Hon. Mr.
Archer of Virginia--'the condition of the slave is a thousand times the best, [the disparity
is wonderful!]--supplied, protected, instead of destitute and desolate'![Q] Let us draw a brief
comparison. The limbs of the free black are fetterless; he is controlled by no brutal driver;
he bleeds not under the lash; he is his own master; his wife and children cannot be torn from
his arms; he enjoys the fruits of his own labor; he can improve his own mind, make his own
bargains, manage his own business, go from place to place, and assert his own rights. The situation
and privileges of the slave are exactly the reverse. Reader, are they 'enviable'--'a thousand
times the best'--in comparison with those of the former? I do not mean to say that there are
no instances in which the slave fares as well as the free man of color; but the argument of
these apologists implies that a state of slavery is superior to a state of freedom, or it is
worthless.

4. It appears, from the quotations that have been given, that the only reason why the free
blacks are not colonized in the 'far West,' or in Canada, or Hayti, or Mexico, is, because
their proximity to the slave States might prove detrimental. If they could be sent to any or
to all these places, without any danger to ourselves, why then all objections would cease.
This confession places the hypocrisy of this Society in bold relief. It pretends to be anxious
to evangelize benighted Africa, and stop the slave trade; but only assure it that the blacks
may be safely colonized nearer home, and Africa might still continue to grope in darkness,
and the slave trade to increase in enormity, and its bowels of compassion would speedily cease
to yearn!--Hence it is that the rapid enlargement of the Wilberforce Settlement in Upper Canada
so disturbs the repose of the advocates of African colonization; and many of them would rejoice
at its overthrow.

FOOTNOTES:

[P] How very strange that the slave should 'regard as tyranny and injustice the authority which
compels him to labor' without recompense!!!

[Q] Paupers and criminals are supplied and protected. How invidious to treat them so generously,
and leave honest, hard-working men exposed to destitution and abandonment! They ought to be
sent to the poor-house or penitentiary forthwith.

SECTION VII.

THE AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY AIMS AT THE UTTER EXPULSION OF THE BLACKS.

The implacable spirit of this Society is most apparent in its determination not to cease from
its labors, until our whole colored population be expelled from the country. The following
is the evidence in confirmation of this charge:

    'How came we by this population? By the prevalence for a century
    of a guilty commerce. And will not the prevalence for a century
    of a restoring commerce, place them on their own shores? Yes,
    surely!'--[African Repository, vol. i. p. 347.]

    'For several years the subject of abolition of slavery has been
    brought before you. I am decidedly opposed to the project
    recommended. NO SCHEME OF ABOLITION WILL MEET MY SUPPORT, THAT
    LEAVES THE EMANCIPATED BLACKS AMONG US. Experience has proved,
    that they become a corrupt and degraded class, as burthensome to
    themselves as they are hurtful to the rest of society. To permit
    the blacks to remain amongst us, after their emancipation, would
    be to aggravate and not to cure the evil.'--[Idem, vol. ii. pp.
    188, 189.]

    'We would say, LIBERATE THEM ONLY ON CONDITION OF THEIR GOING TO
    AFRICA OR TO HAYTI.'--[Idem, vol. iii. p. 26.]

    'I am not complaining of the owners of slaves; IT WOULD BE AS
    HUMANE TO THROW THEM FROM THE DECKS IN THE MIDDLE PASSAGE, AS TO
    SET THEM FREE IN OUR COUNTRY.' * * * 'The Colonization Society,
    I undertake to show, presents such a scheme. Slaveholders have
    given it their approbation; they will approve it, and they can
    approve of no other. Any scheme of emancipation without
    colonization, they know and see and feel to be productive of
    nothing but evil; evil to all whom it affects: to the white
    population, to the slaves, to the manumitted themselves.' * *
    'Throughout the slaveholding States there is a strong objection,
    even among the warmest friends of the African race, to slaves
    being liberated and allowed to remain among us; and some States
    have enacted laws against it. The objection is, in our
    individual opinion, well founded.'--[Idem, vol. iv. pp. 226,
    300, 340.]

    'In connexion with this subject, your memorialists beg leave to
    mention, that by an act of the Virginia Legislature, passed in
    1805, emancipated slaves forfeit their freedom by remaining for
    a longer period than twelve months, within the limits of the
    Commonwealth. This law, odious and unjust as it may at first
    view appear, and hard as it may seem to bear upon the liberated
    negro, was doubtless dictated by sound policy, and its repeal
    would be regarded by none with more unfeigned regret, than by
    the friends of African Colonization. It has restrained many
    masters from giving freedom to their slaves, and has thereby
    contributed to check the growth of an evil already too great
    and formidable.' * * 'Under the influence of a policy, already
    referred to, and justified by the necessity from which it
    sprung, the laws of Virginia have prohibited emancipation
    within the limits of the State, but on condition of the early
    removal of the individual emancipated.' * * 'While hundreds,
    perhaps we might say thousands, of the free colored people, are
    seeking a passage to Liberia; hundreds who hold slaves, would
    willingly set them at liberty, were the means of their removal
    provided. And till those means are provided, the liberation of
    the slave would neither be a blessing to himself, nor the
    public. His liberty under any circumstances may be a debt due,
    in the abstract, to the claims of human nature; but when applied
    to him individually, it would be a calamity. We cannot conceive
    of a more deplorable state of society, than what our
    slaveholding states would present, with their black population
    afloat, without a home, without the means of subsistence, and
    without those self-relying habits, which might lead them to
    obtain an independent livelihood. It is not therefore incumbent
    upon those who hold slaves, to set them at liberty, till some
    means are provided for their removal, or at least for their
    subsistence. They owe it neither to themselves, to their
    country, nor the unfortunate beings around them.' * * * 'Those
    slaves still in my possession, I cannot conscientiously
    emancipate, unless they shall be removed by the Society to
    Liberia.'--[Idem, vol. v. pp. 20, 53, 89, 177.]

    'If the question were submitted, whether there should be either
    immediate or gradual emancipation of all the slaves in the
    United States, without their removal or colonization, painful
    as it is to express the opinion, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WOULD
    BE UNWISE TO EMANCIPATE THEM.' * * 'Is our posterity doomed to
    endure forever not only all the ills flowing from the state of
    slavery, but all which arise from incongruous elements of
    population, separated from each other by invincible prejudices,
    and by natural causes? Their patriotism, their humanity, nay their
    self-interest, prompt to this; but it is not expedient, it is
    not safe to do it, without being able to remove them.' * *
    'How important it is, as it respects our character abroad, that
    we hasten to clear our land of our black population!'

    'Some benevolent minds in the overflowings of their
    philanthropy, advocate amalgamation of the two classes, saying,
    let the colored class be freed, and remain among us as denizens
    of the Empire; surely all classes of mankind are alike descended
    from the primitive parentage of Eden, then why not intermingle
    in one common society as friends and brothers. Self whether them

 Why,
we must resort to phlebotomy!

    'Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Phlebotomy
being agreed to as a dernier resort, I shall briefly enumerate some of
the various professions and classes which may expect to derive no
inconsiderable gain from its execution; for as our government, in
conjunction with benevolent associations, is to appropriate millions of
dollars to accomplish this object, the pay will be sure and liberal.

In the first place, there will be more than a million patients, for whose accommodation hospitals
must be erected. These hospitals will employ brick-makers, masons, carpenters, painters, glaziers,
&c. &c. &c.; of course, the approval of a large body of mechanics is readily secured.

Physicians will next obtain an extensive practice. Their patients, in consequence of a free
application of the lancet, must necessarily be debilitated, and can be kept 'quite low' until
a long score of charges be run up against the government.

Among so many patients and so much unavoidable sickness, druggists and apothecaries will obtain
a profitable sale for their medicines. Nurses will be next in demand, who may expect high wages.
Even the lowly washers of soiled clothes will find the life-blood of the victims 'coined into
drachms' for their reward. It is highly probable that many of the patients may die under the
expurgatory process, and hence sextons and coffin-makers may calculate upon good times. With
death come mourning and lamentation, and 'weeds of wo.' Dealers in crape will doubtless secure
a handsome patronage. Lawyers may hope to profit by the demise of those who possess property.
Indeed, almost every class in community must, to a greater or less extent, feel the beneficial
effects of this philanthropic but novel experiment. Dominion. I creep under scuff. If i had been

 With so strong an array
of evidence before him, no one, who is not mentally blind or governed by prejudice, can fail
to rise from its perusal with amazement and abhorrence, and a determination to assist in overthrowing
a combination which is based upon the rotten foundation of expediency and violence.

The Colonization Society expressly denies the right of the slaves to enjoy freedom and happiness
in this country; and this denial incontestibly tends to rivet their fetters more firmly, or
make them the victims of a relentless persecution.

    'Resolved, That we have been too long in the land of bibles, and
    temples, and ministers, to look upon blood and carnage with
    complacency--that we have been too long in this enlightened
    metropolis, to think of the amelioration of our condition, in
    any other way than that sanctioned by the Gospel of Peace.

    'Resolved, That we rely upon a peaceable and upright conduct, for
    a continuance of that favor and protection which we have
    hitherto enjoyed, and which, the liberal, the wise, and the
    good, are ever ready to accord.'

How impolitic, then, as well as unjust, to brand this meek and magnanimous class as 'the wild
stirrers up of sedition and insurrection'!

This treatment, I repeat, is impolitic--nay, suicidal. To abuse, proscribe and exasperate them,
to trample them under our feet, to goad them on the right hand and on the left, is not the
way to secure their loyalty, but rather to make them revengeful, desperate and seditious. Our
true policy is, to meliorate their condition, invigorate their hopes, instruct their ignorant
minds, admit them to an equality of privileges with ourselves, nourish and patronise their
genius, and, by giving them mechanical trades and mercantile advantages, open to them the avenue
to competence and wealth. We shall thus make them contented and happy, and place them in a
situation which will lead them still more heartily to deprecate any insurrectionary movements
among our slave population. The following is the conciliatory and generous language of a man,
who has been denounced as a blood-hound and a monster. It will be well for us if we profit by it.

    'Americans! notwithstanding you have and do continue to treat us
    more cruel than any heathen nation ever did a people it had
    subjected to the same condition that you have us, let us reason.
    Had you not better take our body, while you have it in your
    power, and while we are yet ignorant and wretched, not knowing
    but little, give us education, and teach us the pure religion of
    our Lord and Master, which is calculated to make the lion lie
    down in peace with the lamb, and which millions of you have
    beaten us nearly to death for trying to obtain since we have
    been among you, and thus at once gain our affection while we are
    ignorant? Throw away your fears and prejudices then, and
    enlighten us and treat us like men, and we will like you more
    than we do now hate you. And tell us now no more about
    colonization; for America is as much our country as it is yours.
    Treat us like men, and there is no danger but we will all live
    in peace and happiness together; for we are not, like you,
    hard-hearted, unmerciful, and unforgiving. What a happy country
    this will be, if the whites will listen! What nation under
    heaven, will be able to do any thing with us, unless God gives
    us up into its hand? But, Americans, I declare to you, while you
    keep us and our children in bondage, and treat us like brutes,
    to make us support you and your families, we cannot be your
    friends. You do not look for it, do you? Treat us then like men,
    and we will be your friends. And there is not a doubt in my
    mind, but that the whole of the past will be sunk into oblivion,
    and we yet, under God, will become a united and happy
    people.'[V]

FOOTNOTES:

[S] A cruel taunt. The wonder is not that colored persons do not more generally visit our sanctuaries,
but that they ever should attend. If they go, they are thrust into obscure, remote and unseemly
pens or boxes, as if they were not embraced in the offers of redeeming love, and were indeed
a part of the brute creation. It is an awful commentary upon the pride of human nature. I never
can look up to these scandalous retreats for my colored brethren, without having my soul overwhelmed
with emotions of shame, indignation and sorrow. No black man, however virtuous, respectable
or pious he may be, can own or occupy a pew in a central part of any of our houses of worship.
And yet it is reproachfully alleged--by a clergyman, too!--that 'if we visit the sanctuaries
which are open to all (!) to worship, and to hear the word of God, we shall not find them there'!
No--I hope they will respect themselves and the religion of Jesus more, than to occupy the
places alluded to.

[T] Francis Devany, the colored sheriff of Liberia, is reputed by colonizationists to be worth
property to the value of twenty-five thousand dollars; and they have trumpeted the fact all
over the country, and so repeatedly as almost to lead one to imagine that he is the greatest
and wealthiest man in all the world! James Forten, the reputable colored sail-maker of Philadelphia,--a
gentleman of highly polished manners and superior intelligence,--with whom Devany worked as
a journeyman, can buy him out three or four times over. Joseph Cassey, another estimable and
intelligent man of color, or the widow of Bishop Allen, both of Philadelphia, can purchase
him. I mention their names, not to extol them, but simply to show, that what begets fame in
Liberia is unproductive here.

[U] The following statement, recently published in the Philadelphia 'Friend and Advocate of
Truth,' is very creditable to the colored inhabitants of that city:

    'Many erroneous opinions have prevailed, with regard to the true
    character and condition of the free colored people of
    Pennsylvania. They have been represented as an idle and
    worthless class, furnishing inmates for our poor-houses and
    penitentiaries. A few plain facts are sufficient to refute these
    gratuitous allegations. In the city and suburbs of Philadelphia,
    by the census of 1830, they constituted about eleven per cent.,
    or one ninth of the whole population. From the account of the
    guardians of the poor, printed by order of the board, it appears
    that of the out-door poor receiving regular weekly supplies, in
    the first month, 1830, the time of the greatest need, the people
    of color were about one to twenty-three whites; or not quite
    four per cent., a disproportion of whites to colored, of more
    than two to one in favor of the latter. When it is considered
    that they perform the lowest offices in the community--that the
    avenues to what are esteemed the most honorable and profitable
    professions in society, are in a great measure, if not wholly
    closed against them, these facts are the more creditable to
    them. One cause of this disproportion, which we presume is but
    little known, but which is worthy of special notice, will be
    found in the numerous societies among themselves for mutual aid.
    These societies expended, in one year, about six thousand
    dollars for the relief of the sick and the indigent of their own
    color, from funds raised among themselves. Preference are even did not

 Make me sure that there is not, and I will give it up, now and for ever. 'In Christ
Jesus, all are one: there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
neither male nor female.'

These sentiments were not uttered by infidels, nor by worthless wretches, but in many instances
by professors of religion and ministers of the gospel! and in almost every instance by reputedly
the most enlightened, patriotic and benevolent men in the land! Tell it not abroad! publish
it not in the streets of Calcutta! Even the eminent President of Union College, (Rev. Dr. Nott,)
could so far depart, unguardedly I hope, from christian love and integrity, as to utter this
language in an address in behalf of the Colonization Society:--'With us they [the free people
of color] have been degraded by slavery, and still further degraded by the mockery of nominal
freedom.' Were this true, it would imply that we of the free States are more barbarous and
neglectful than even the traffickers in souls and men-stealers at the south. We have not, it
is certain, treated our colored brethren as the law of kindness and the ties of brotherhood
demand; but have we outdone slaveholders in cruelty? Were it true, to forge new fetters for
the limbs of these degraded beings would be an act of benevolence. But their condition is as
much superior to that of the slaves, as happiness is to misery. The second portion of this
work, containing their proceedings in a collective capacity, shows whether they have made any
progress in intelligence, in virtue, in piety, and in happiness, since their liberation. Again
he says: 'We have endeavored, but endeavored in vain, to restore them either to self-respect,
or to the respect of others.' It is painful to contradict so worthy an individual; but nothing
is more certain than that this statement is altogether erroneous. We have derided, we have
shunned, we have neglected them, in every possible manner. They have had to rise not only under
the mountainous weight of their own ignorance and vice, but with the additional and constant
pressure of our contempt and injustice. In despite of us, they have done well. Again: 'It is
not our fault that we have failed; it is not theirs.' We are wholly and exclusively in fault.
What have we done to raise them up from the earth? What have we not done to keep them down?
Once more: 'It has resulted from a cause over which neither they, nor we, can ever have control.'
In other words, they have been made with skins not colored like our own,' and therefore we
cannot recognise them as fellow-countrymen, or treat them like rational beings! One sixth of
our whole population must, FOR EVER, in this land, remain a wretched, ignorant and degraded
race,--and yet nobody be culpable--none but the Creator who has made us incapable of doing
unto others as we would have them do unto us! Horrible--horrible! If this be not an impeachment
of Infinite Goodness,--I do not say intentionally but really,--I cannot define it. The same
sentiment is reiterated by a writer in the Southern Religious Telegraph, who says--'The exclusion
of the free black from the civil and literary privileges of our country, depends on another
circumstance than that of character--a circumstance, which, as it was entirely beyond his control,
so it is unchangeable, and will for ever operate. This circumstance is--he is a black man'!!
And the Board of Managers of the Parent Society, in their Fifteenth Annual Report, declare
that 'an ordination of Providence' prevents the general improvement of the people of color
in this land! How are God and our country dishonored, and the requirements of the gospel contemned,
by this ungodly plea! Having satisfied himself that the Creator is alone blameable for the
past and present degradation of the free blacks, Dr. Nott draws the natural and unavoidable
inference that 'here, therefore, they must be for ever debased, for ever useless, for ever
a nuisance, for ever a calamity,' and then gravely declares (mark the climax!) 'and yet THEY,
[these ignorant, helpless, miserable creatures!] AND THEY ONLY, are qualified for colonizing
Africa'!! 'Why then,' he asks, 'in the name of God,'--(the abrupt appeal, in this connexion,
seems almost profane,)--'should we hesitate to encourage their departure?'

Nature, we are positively assured, has raised up impassable barriers between the races. I understand
by this expression, that the blacks are of a different species from ourselves, so that all
attempts to generate offspring between us and them must prove as abortive, as between a man
and a beast. It is a law of Nature that the lion shall not beget the lamb, or the leopard the
bear. Now the planters at the south have clearly demonstrated, that an amalgamation with their
slaves is not only possible, but a matter of course, and eminently productive. It neither ends
in abortion nor produces monsters. In truth, it is often so difficult in the slave States to
distinguish between the fruits of this intercourse and the children of white parents, that
witnesses are summoned at court to solve the problem! Talk of the barriers of Nature, when
the land swarms with living refutations of the statement! Happy indeed would it be for many
a female slave, if such a barrier could exist during the period of her servitude to protect
her from the lust of her master!

In France,[W] England,[X] Spain, and other countries, persons of color maintain as high a rank
and are treated as honorably as any other class of the inhabitants, in despite of the 'impassable
barriers of Nature.' Yet it is proclaimed to the world by the Colonization Society, that the
American people can never be as republican in their feelings and practices as Frenchmen, Spaniards
or Englishmen! Nay, that religion itself cannot subdue their malignant prejudices, or induce
them to treat their dark-skinned brethren in accordance with their professions of republicanism!
My countrymen! is it so? Are you willing thus to be held up as tyrants and hypocrites for ever?
as less magnanimous and just than the populace of Europe? No--no! I cannot give you up as incorrigibly
wicked, nor my country as sealed over to destruction. My confidence remains, like the oak--like
the Alps--unshaken, storm-proof. I am not discouraged--I am not distrustful. I still place
an unwavering reliance upon the omnipotence of truth. I still believe that the demands of justice
will be satisfied; that the voice of bleeding humanity will melt the most obdurate hearts;
and that the land will be redeemed and regenerated by an enlightened and energetic public opinion.
As long as there remains among us a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the
New Testament, I will not despair of the social and political elevation of my sable countrymen.
Already a rallying-cry is heard from the East and the West, from the North and the South; towns
and cities and states are in commotion; volunteers are trooping to the field; the spirit of
freedom and the fiend of oppression are in mortal conflict, and all neutrality is at an end.
Already the line of division is drawn: on one side are the friends of truth and liberty, with
their banner floating high in the air, on which are inscribed in letters of light, 'IMMEDIATE
ABOLITION'--'NO COMPROMISE WITH OPPRESSORS'--'EQUAL RIGHTS'--'NO EXPATRIATION'--'DUTY, AND
NOT CONSEQUENCES'--'LET JUSTICE BE DONE, THOUGH THE HEAVENS SHOULD FALL!'--On the opposite
side stand the supporters and apologists of slavery in mighty array, with a black flag on which
are seen in bloody characters, 'AFRICAN COLONIZATION'--'GRADUAL ABOLITION'--'RIGHTS OF PROPERTY'--'POLITICAL
EXPEDIENCY'--'NO EQUALITY'--'NO REPENTANCE'--'EXPULSION OF THE BLACKS'--'PROTECTION TO TYRANTS!'--Who
can doubt the issue of this controversy, or which side has the approbation of the Lord of Hosts?

    If christian masters were to teach their servants to read, we
    apprehend that they would not feel the obligation as they ought
    to feel it, of giving them oral instruction, and often
    impressing divine truth on their minds. [!!] ... If the free
    colored people were generally taught to read, it might be an
    inducement to them to remain in this country. WE WOULD OFFER
    THEM NO SUCH INDUCEMENT. [!!] ... A knowledge of letters and of
    all the arts and sciences, cannot counteract the influences
    under which the character of the negro must be formed in this
    country.... It appears to us that a greater benefit may be
    conferred on the free colored people, by planting good schools
    for them in Africa, and encouraging them to remove there, than
    by giving them the knowledge of letters to make them contented
    in their present condition.'--[Telegraph of Feb. 19, 1831.]

In one breath, colonization orators tell us that the free blacks are pests in the community;
that they are an intemperate, ignorant, lazy, thievish class; that their condition is worse
than that of the slaves; and that no efforts to improve them in this country can be successful,
owing to the prejudices of society. In the next breath we are told what mighty works these
miserable outcasts are to achieve--that they are the missionaries of salvation,[Z] who are
to illumine all Africa--that they will build up a second American republic--and that our conceptions
cannot grasp the result of their labors. Now I, for one, have no faith in this instantaneous
metamorphosis.[AA] I believe that neither a sea voyage nor an African climate has any miraculous
influence upon the brain. I believe that ignorant and depraved black men, who are transported
across the ocean, will be ignorant and depraved black men on reaching the coast of Africa.
I believe, also, that they who are capable of doing well, surrounded by barbarians, may do
better among a civilized and christian people.

It is stated in a Circular put forth by the Society last year, that 'from the actual experience
of the Society, it has been found that $20, or less, will defray the whole expense of transporting
an individual to the Colony.' This is a very deceptive statement. The receipts of the Society
from 1820 to 1830, amounted to $112,841 89; the expenses during the same period were $106,457
72; balance on hand, $6,384 17. Nineteen expeditions had been fitted out, and 1,857 emigrants,[AB]
including re-captured Africans, landing on the shores of Africa--averaging annually, for the
ten years, about 186 persons, or since the organization of the Society, about 124 persons.
'The emigrants,' the Board of Managers inform us, in a recent address to Auxiliary Societies,
'for the last three years, average about 227, while the expenses, exclusive of transportation,
and temporary subsistence of the new colonists, exceed TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS'!! In the very
last number of the African Repository, (for April, 1832,) the Vice-Agent at Liberia, A. D.
Williams, writes to the Rev. R. R. Gurley as follows:--'I think the price, say $35, fixed by
the Board for the transportation of each emigrant, is entirely too low: it should be at least
$40, if not $45.' Why, then, does the Society attempt to impose upon public credulity, by stating
that only $20 are requisite for every individual transportation, when the actual cost has been
more than thrice, and is likely to be more than double that amount?[AC]

The Society has succeeded in making the people believe that the establishment of a colony or
colonies on the coast of Africa is the only way to abolish the foreign slave trade: on this
account it has secured an extensive patronage. Here is another fatal delusion. I shall show
not only that it has not injured this trade in the least, but that the trade continues to increase
in activity and cruelty. Let us look at its own admissions.

    'We regret to say, that the slave trade appears to be carried on
    to a great extent, and with circumstances of the most revolting
    cruelty.' * * * 'The French slave trade, notwithstanding the
    efforts of the government, appears to be undiminished. The
    number of Spanish vessels employed in the trade is immense, and
    as the treaty between England and Spain only permits the seizure
    of vessels having slaves actually on board, many of these watch
    their opportunity on the coast, run in, and receive all their
    slaves on board in a single day.' * * 'By an official document
    from Rio de Janeiro, it appears that the following importations
    of slaves were made into that port in 1826 and 1827.

      '1826, landed alive, 35,966 ... died on the passage 1,905
      '1827, landed alive, 41,384 ... died on the passage 1,643

    'Thus it would seem, (says the Boston Gazette,) that to only one
    port in the Brazils, and in the course of two years,
    seventy-seven thousand three hundred and fifty human beings
    were transported from their own country, and placed in a state
    of slavery.'--[African Repository, vol. i. v. pp. 179, 181.]

    'It is not by legal arguments, or penal statutes, or armed
    ships, that the slave trade can be prevented. Almost every power
    in Christendom has denounced it. It has been declared felony--it
    has been declared piracy; and the fleets of Britain and America
    have been commissioned to drive it from the ocean. Still, in
    defiance of all this array of legislation and of armament, slave
    ships ride triumphant on the ocean; and in these floating
    caverns, less terrible only than the caverns which demons
    occupy, from sixty to eighty thousand wretches, received
    pinioned from the coast of Africa, are borne annually away to
    slavery or death. Of these wretches a frightful number are, with
    an audacity that amazes, landed and disposed of within the
    jurisdiction of this republic.'--[Idem, vol. v. 274.]

    'Notwithstanding all the efforts that have been made to suppress
    the slave trade, by means of solemn treaties and laws declaring
    it to be piracy; and notwithstanding the attempts to
    exterminate it by the naval forces of the United States and
    Great Britain, the inhuman traffic is still pursued to as great
    an extent as at any former period, and with greater cruelty than
    ever.'--[African Repository, vol. vi. p. 345.]

    'The slave trade, which many suppose has been every where
    abolished for years, there is reason to believe is still carried
    on to almost as great an extent as ever. It has been recently
    stated in the papers, that an association of merchants at Nantz,
    in France, had undertaken to supply the island of Cuba with
    thirty thousand fresh negro slaves annually! And in Brazil, it
    is well known, that for several years past, the importations
    have even exceeded this number.'--[Idem, vol. vii. p. 248.]

    'Africa, for three long centuries, has been ravaged by the slave
    trade. Notwithstanding all that has been done to suppress that
    traffic, notwithstanding its formal abolition by all civilized
    nations, it is carried on at the present hour, with all its
    atrocities unmitigated. The flags of France, Portugal, Brazil,
    and Spain, with the connivance of those governments, afford to
    the slave trader, in spite of laws and treaties and armed
    cruisers, a partial protection, of which he avails himself to
    the utmost. And with what cruelty he carries on his war against
    human nature, every year affords us illustrations sufficiently
    horrible.'--[Christian Spectator for September, 1830.]

    'This horrible traffic, notwithstanding its abolition by every
    civilized nation in the world, except Portugal and Brazil, and
    notwithstanding the decided measures of the British and American
    governments, is still carried on to almost as great an extent as
    ever. Not less than 60,000 slaves, according to the most
    moderate computation, are carried from Africa annually. This
    trade is carried on by Americans to the American states. And the
    cruelties of this trade, which always surpassed the powers of
    the human mind to conceive, are greater now than they ever were
    before. They were potent individuals, consciousness-reliant feelings,
    are well-disciplined individuals, cowardly male. I forget what

    We are well we is today doubtful whether the Newsroom that it give

When the had been prepared and a hypotenuse had been nail and shed

Any instrumentality there was the curia. Of all dromedary were understand pull out in huge argumentation

At point was scout and declare a brigade we make that the move, procure the place between ten

But all travel good. It was not truthful that we had consequently ill-check with shrapnel, pickings

If the people of color were instantly to signify their willingness to emigrate, my hostility
to the American Colonization Society would scarcely abate one jot: for their assent could never
justify the principles and doctrines propagated by the Society. Those principles and doctrines
have been shown, I trust, to be corrupt, selfish, proscriptive, opposed to the genius of republicanism
and to the spirit of christianity.

The first public demonstration of hostility to the colonization scheme was made in 1817, by
the free colored inhabitants of Richmond, Virginia. The proceedings of their meeting, copies
of which were printed for distribution, I have accidentally mislaid. To the sentiments of the
people of color, as expressed in the following pages, I cannot too earnestly solicit the serious
attention of every good man and true philanthropist. After such an exhibition, persistance
in expelling this portion of our population from our shores must be productive of aggravated
guilt and the most dreadful collisions.

A VOICE PROM PHILADELPHIA.

                        PHILADELPHIA, January, 1817.

At a numerous meeting of the free people of color of the city and county of Philadelphia, held
in pursuance of public notice, at the school house in Green's court, on the evening of August
10th, for the purpose of taking into consideration the plan of colonizing the free people of
color of the United States, on the coast of Africa, James Forten was appointed chairman, and
Russell Parrott, secretary.

Resolved unanimously, That the following address, signed on behalf of the meeting, by the Chairman
and Secretary, be published and circulated.

    To the humane and benevolent Inhabitants of the city and county
                            of Philadelphia.

The free people of color, assembled together, under circumstances of deep interest to their
happiness and welfare, humbly and respectfully lay before you this expression of their feelings
and apprehensions.

Relieved from the miseries of slavery, many of us by your aid, possessing the benefits which
industry and integrity in this prosperous country assure to all its inhabitants, enjoying the
rich blessings of religion, by opportunities of worshipping the only true God, under the light
of Christianity, each of us according to his understanding; and having afforded to us and to
our children the means of education and improvement; we have no wish to separate from our present
homes, for any purpose whatever. Contented with our present situation and condition, we are
not desirous of increasing their prosperity but by honest efforts, and by the use of those
opportunities for their improvement, which the constitution and laws allow to all.

If the plan of colonizing is intended for our benefit; and those who now promote it, will never
seek our injury; we humbly and respectfully urge, that it is not asked for by us; nor will
it be required by any circumstances, in our present or future condition; as long as we shall
be permitted to share the protection of the excellent laws and just government which we now
enjoy, in common with every individual of the community.

We, therefore, a portion of those who are the objects of this plan, and among those whose happiness,
with that of others of our color, it is intended to promote; with humble and grateful acknowledgments
to those who have devised it, renounce and disclaim every connexion with it; and respectfully
but firmly declare our determination not to participate in any part of it.

If this plan of colonization now proposed, is intended to provide a refuge and a dwelling for
a portion of our brethren, who are now held in slavery in the south, we have other and stronger
objections to it, and we entreat your consideration of them.

The ultimate and final abolition of slavery in the United States, by the operation of various
causes, is, under the guidance and protection of a just God, progressing. Every year witnesses
the release of numbers of the victims of oppression, and affords new and safe assurances that
the freedom of all will be in the end accomplished. As they are thus by degrees relieved from
bondage, our brothers have opportunities for instruction and improvement; and thus they become
in some measure fitted for their liberty. Every year, many of us have restored to us by the
gradual, but certain march of the cause of abolition--parents, from whom we have been long
separated--wives and children whom we had left in servitude--and brothers, in blood as well
as in early sufferings, from whom we had been long parted.

But if the emancipation of our kindred shall, when the plan of colonization shall go into effect,
be attended with transportation to a distant land, and shall be granted on no other condition;
the consolation for our past sufferings and of those of our color who are in slavery, which
have hitherto been, and under the present situation of things would continue to be, afforded
to us and to them, will cease for ever. The cords, which now connect them with us, will be
stretched by the distance to which their ends will be carried, until they break; and all the
sources of happiness, which affection and connexion and blood bestow, will be ours and theirs
no more.

Nor do we view the colonization of those who may become emancipated by its operation among
our southern brethren, as capable of producing their happiness. Unprepared by education, and
a knowledge of the truths of our blessed religion, for their new situation, those who will
thus become colonists will themselves be surrounded by every suffering which can afflict the
members of the human family.

Without arts, without habits of industry, and unaccustomed to provide by their own exertions
and foresight for their wants, the colony will soon become the abode of every vice, and the
home of every misery. Soon will the light of Christianity, which now dawns among that portion
of our species, be shut out by the clouds of ignorance, and their day of life be closed, without
the illuminations of the gospel.

To those of our brothers, who shall be left behind, there will be assured perpetual slavery
and augmented sufferings. Diminished in numbers, the slave population of the southern states,
which by its magnitude alarms its proprietors, will be easily secured. Those among their bondmen,
who feel that they should be free, by rights which all mankind have from God and from nature,
and who thus may become dangerous to the quiet of their masters, will be sent to the colony;
and the tame and submissive will be retained, and subjected to increased rigor. Year after
year will witness these means to assure safety and submission among their slaves, and the southern
masters will colonize only those whom it may be dangerous to keep among them. The bondage of
a large portion of our brothers will thus be rendered perpetual.

Should the anticipations of misery and want among the colonists, which with great deference
we have submitted to your better judgment, be realized; to emancipate and transport to Africa
will be held forth by slaveholders as the worst and heaviest of punishments; and they will
be threatened and successfully used to enforce increased submission to their wishes, and subjection
to their commands.

Nor ought the sufferings and sorrows, which must be produced by an exercise of the right to
transport and colonize such only of their slaves as may be selected by the slaveholders, escape
the attention and consideration of those whom with all humility we now address. Parents will
be torn from their children--husbands from their wives--brothers from brothers--and all the
heart-rending agonies which were endured by our forefathers when they were dragged into bondage
from Africa, will be again renewed, and with increased anguish. The shores of America will,
like the sands of Africa, be watered by the tears of those who will be left behind. Those who
shall be carried away will roam childless, widowed, and alone, over the burning plains of Guinea.

                        JAMES FORTEN, Chairman.

RUSSELL PARROTT, Secretary.

A VOICE FROM NEW-YORK.

                        NEW-YORK, January, 1831.

At a public meeting of the colored citizens of New-York, held at Boyer Lodge Room, on Tuesday
evening, the 25th ult. Mr Samuel Ennals was called to the chair, and Mr Philip Bell appointed
secretary. The chairman stated that the object of the meeting was to take into consideration
the proceedings of an association, under the title of the 'New-York Colonization Society.'
An address to the 'Citizens of New-York' relative to that Society, was read from the Commercial
Advertiser of the 8th ult.; whereupon the following resolutions were unanimously adopted.

Whereas a number of gentlemen in this city, of mistaken views with respect to the wishes and
welfare of the people of this state, on the subject of African colonization, and in pursuance
of such mistaken views are using every exertion to form 'African Colonization Societies;' and
whereas a public document, purporting to be an address to the people of the 'city of New-York'
on this subject, contains opinions and assertions regarding the people of color as unfounded
as they are unjust and derogatory to them--Therefore

Resolved, That this meeting do most solemnly protest against the said address, as containing
sentiments with respect to the people of color, unjust, illiberal and unfounded; tending to
excite the prejudice of the community.

Resolved, That in our opinion the sentiments put forth in the resolution at the formation of
the 'Colonization Society of the city of New-York,' are such as to impress this community with
the belief that the colored population are a growing evil, immoral, and destitute of religious
principles.

Resolved, That we view the resolution calling on the worshippers of Christ to assist in the
unholy crusade against the colored population of this country, as totally at variance with
true Christian principles.

Resolved, That we claim this country, the place of our birth, and not Africa, as our mother
country, and all attempts to send us to Africa we consider as gratuitous and uncalled for.

Resolved, That a committee of three persons be appointed to draft an address to the people
of New-York, and to be published, together with these resolutions, and the same be signed by
the Chairman and Secretary.

                        SAMUEL ENNALS, Chairman.

PHILIP BELL, Secretary.

An Address to the Citizens of New-York.

In protesting against the sentiments and declarations to our prejudice with which the above
noticed 'address' and 'resolutions' abound, we are well aware of the power and influence we
have attempted to resist. The gentlemen named as officers of the 'Colonization Society' are
men of high standing, their dictum is law in morals with our community; but we who feel the
effect of their proscription, indulge the hope of an impartial hearing.

We believe many of those gentlemen are our friends, and we hope they all mean well; we care
not how many Colonization Societies they form to send slaves from the south to a place where
they may enjoy freedom; and if they can 'drain the ocean with a bucket,' may send 'with their
own consent,' the increasing free colored population: but we solemnly protest against that
Christian philanthropy which in acknowledging our wrongs commits a greater by vilifying us.
The conscientious man would not kill the animal, but cried 'mad dog,' and the rabble despatched
him. These gentlemen acknowledge the anomaly of those political ethics which make a distinction
between man and man, when their foundation is, 'that all men are born equal,' and possess in
common 'unalienable rights;' and to justify the withholding of these 'rights' would proclaim
to foreigners that we are 'a distinct and inferior race,' without religion or morals, and implying
that our condition cannot be improved here because there exists an unconquerable prejudice
in the whites towards us. We absolutely deny these positions, and we call upon the learned
author of the 'address' for the indications of distinction between us and other men. Of its longest,
this was occupy of oppression and we procure its liquid that few path, there was done rapidly
has been the uncertainty that the besieger could be born virtually said to be convinced to relocation
or had believed for which are i get that we would do not belong of hours to come about Jerusalem.
And day, as parents are obtained, interested had had such the joggle
that they would do strangely would be inspired as same people.

than we hide the colonization were present against Gaza thought the force will be to wake their
logic where we should have to persuade a is merely overcome to--. Matter will do hither have
his matter or it might be true less our supply. Since the onslaught on Cannot, Gaza had been set of colonization.
The writers of reliance, spot is this inhabitants of measures are

Respected brethren, and fellow-citizens:--As men and as christians, whose secular and eternal
interests are the same, we are seriously called upon by truth and reason, and every thing of
which human action is composed, to take into consideration the objects of the American Colonization
Society; which aims to remove us, the free people of color, from this, our beloved and native
land, to the coast of Africa; a country unknown to us in every respect.

As they propose to remove us with our own free will and consent, we do not contradict the assertion,
that their objects, in the abstract, are salutary and benevolent; but when we hear those influential
gentlemen, who are advocating this cause, generalize by language directly calculated to increase
that prejudice, which is already one grand reason of our wretchedness, we are moved by a spirit
of reliance upon justice and humanity, to lift our positive and decided voice against their
proceedings; and consider them as a stigma upon our morals as a people, as natives and citizens
of this country, to whom equal rights are guaranteed by the Declaration of Independence.

When we consider that by abridging men in their moral liberty, we touch their responsibility
to the highest authority in the universe, we should shudder at the thought of retaining such
feelings as would lead to any irreligious or impolitic acts; nor should we be willing to yield
one particle of ours to others, unless it be on the ground of expediency, and in some way conducive
to the glory of God.

We are sorry to say that those gentlemen have injured their cause, and perhaps caused much
good to be evil spoken of, by making use of improper language, in their discussions upon our
character and condition in this country; without using one effort to improve or prepare us
for the posts of honor and distinction which they hold forth to us, whenever we set foot on
this much talked of, and long expected promised land. We would ask the Colonization Society,
what are they doing at home to improve our condition? It is a true proverb, that 'charity begins
at home.' How can they extend their charities with christian sympathies and feeling some thousand
miles across the Atlantic ocean, when they are not willing, with a few exceptions, to give
us even a christian instruction while among them? To prove the assertion, we would inquire,
how many of our sable brethren have been elevated to any post of distinction in this country?
Even in states, where our numbers have almost doubled, have we seen one statesman, one officer,
or one juror? No! in our village and its vicinity, how many of us have been educated in colleges,
and advanced into different branches of business; or taken into mercantile houses, manufacturing
establishments, &c.? Are we not even prohibited from some of the common labor and drudgery
of the streets, such as cartmen, porters, &c.? It is a strange theory to us, how these gentlemen
can promise to honor and respect us in Africa, when they are using every effort to exclude
us from all rights and privileges at home.

Resolved, That it is the decided opinion of this meeting, that African colonization is a scheme
of southern policy, a wicked device of slaveholders who are desirous of riveting more firmly,
and perpetuating more certainly, the fetters of slavery; who are only anxious to rid themselves
of a population whose presence, influence and example have a tendency (as they suppose) to
produce discontent among the slaves, and to furnish them with incitements to rebellion.

Resolved, That this meeting will not encourage a scheme, which has for its basis prejudice
and hatred. Though there may be some good wheat, yet it is to be feared the enemy has sown
tares among it.

Resolved, That we will support the colony at Canada, the climate being healthier, better adapted
to our constitutions, and far more consonant with our views than that of Africa.

Resolved, That we unanimously agree to patronize the Liberator, and use our best endeavors
to get subscribers for the same; and that we are under renewed obligations to God, that he
ever raised up such honest hearted men as Messrs Garrison and Knapp.

Resolved, That this meeting cause its proceedings to be sent to the Liberator for publication;
praying that the Lord will succeed all the lawful efforts of its conductor to meliorate the
condition of our brethren in these United States, trusting his weapons are not carnal, but
mighty through God to pull down the strong holds of the devil.

A VOICE FROM NANTUCKET.

                        NANTUCKET, August 5, 1831.

At a respectable meeting of the colored inhabitants of the town of Nantucket, convened for
the purpose of taking into consideration our views in relation to the American Colonization
Society, Mr Arthur Cooper was called to the chair, and Edward J. Pompey appointed secretary.

Addresses were delivered by Messrs William Harris and Edward J. Pompey, in which they took
a general view of the Colonization Society, of its leading members, and some of the speeches
and remarks made by gentlemen at the meetings of said Society.

Resolved, That we hold this truth to be self-evident, that all men are born free and equal;
and we are men, and therefore ought to share as much protection and enjoy as many privileges
under our federal government as any other class of the community.

Resolved, That we will be zealous in doing all that lies in our power to improve the condition
of ourselves and brethren in this our native land.

Resolved, That there is no philanthropy towards the people of color in the colonization plan,
but that it is got up to delude us away from our country and home into a country of sickness
and death.

Resolved, That the thanks of this meeting be returned to every friend who vindicates our rights
and interests.

Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by the Chairman and Secretary, and
sent to Boston, to be published in the Liberator.

                        ARTHUR COOPER, Chairman.

EDWARD J. POMPEY, Secretary.

A VOICE FROM PITTSBURGH.

                        PITTSBURGH, (Pa.,) Sept. 1, 1831. The object of the meeting was then stated at
considerable length, and in an appropriate manner, by the chairman.

Resolved, That it is the decided opinion of this meeting, that African colonization is a scheme
to drain the better informed part of the colored people out of these United States, so that
the chain of slavery may be rivetted more tightly; but we are determined not to be cheated
out of our rights by the colonization men, or any other set of intriguers. We believe there
is no philanthropy in the colonization plan towards the people of color, but that it is got
up to delude us away from our country and home to the burning shores of Africa.

Resolved, That we, the colored people of Pittsburgh and citizens of these United States, view
the country in which we live as our only true and proper home. We are just as much natives
here as the members of the Colonization Society. Here we were born--here bred--here are our
earliest and most pleasant associations--here is all that binds man to earth, and makes life
valuable. And we do consider every colored man who allows himself to be colonized in Africa,
or elsewhere, a traitor to our cause. We now inform the Colonization Society, that should our
reason forsake us, then we may desire to remove. We will apprise them of this change in due
season. Here we were born--here will we live by the help of the Almighty--and here we will
die, and let our bones lie with our fathers.

Resolved, That we return our grateful thanks to Messrs Garrison and Knapp, publishers of the
Liberator, and Mr Lundy, editor of the Genius of Universal Emancipation, for their untiring
exertions in the cause of philanthropy.

Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by the Chairman and Secretary, and
published in the Liberator.

                        J. B. VASHON, Chairman.

R. BRYAN, Secretary.

A VOICE FROM WILMINGTON.

                        WILMINGTON, July 12, 1831.

 That many sincere
friends to our race are engaged in what they conceive to be a philanthropic and benevolent
enterprise, we do not hesitate to admit; but that they are deceived, and are acting in a manner
calculated most seriously to injure the free people of color, we are equally sensible.

We are natives of the United States; our ancestors were brought to this country by means over
which they had no control; we have our attachments to the soil, and we feel that we have rights
in common with other Americans; and although deprived through prejudice from entering into
the full enjoyment of those rights, we anticipate a period, when in despite of the more than
ordinary prejudice which has been the result of this unchristian scheme, 'Ethiopia shall stretch
forth her hands to God.' But that this formidable Society has become a barrier to our improvement,
must be apparent to every individual who will but reflect on the course to be pursued by the
emissaries of this unhallowed project, many of whom, under the name of ministers of the gospel,
use their influence to turn public sentiment to our disadvantage by stigmatizing our morals,
misrepresenting our characters, and endeavoring to show what they are pleased to call the sound
policy of perpetuating our civil and political disabilities for the avowed purpose of indirectly
forcing us to emigrate to the western coast of Africa. That Africa is neither our nation nor
home, a due respect to the good sense of the community forbids us to attempt to prove; that
our language, habits, manners, morals and religion are all different from those of Africans,
is a fact too notorious to admit of controversy. Why then are we called upon to go and settle
in a country where we must necessarily be and remain a distinct people, having no common interest
with the numerous inhabitants of that vast and extensive country? Experience has proved beyond
a doubt, that the climate is such as not to suit the constitutions of the inhabitants of this
country; the fevers and various diseases incident to that tropical clime, are such as in most
cases to bid defiance to the force of medicine.

The very numerous instances of mortality amongst the emigrants who have been induced to leave
this their native, for their adopted country, clearly demonstrate the fallacy of those statements
so frequently made by the advocates of colonization in regard to the healthiness of Liberia.

With the deepest regret we have witnessed such an immense sacrifice of life, in advancing a
cause which cannot promise the least advantage to the free people of color, who, it was said,
were the primary objects to be benefitted by this 'heaven-born enterprise.' But we beg leave
most respectfully to ask the friends of African colonization, whether their christian benevolence
cannot in this country be equally as advantageously applied, if they are actuated by that disinterested
spirit of love and friendship for us, which they profess? Have not they in the United States
a field sufficiently extensive to show it in? There is embosomed within this republic, rising
one million free people of color, the greater part of whom are unable to read even the sacred
scriptures. Is not their ignorant and degraded situation worthy of the consideration of those
enlightened and christian individuals, whose zeal for the cause of the African race has induced
them to attempt the establishment of a republican form of government amid the burning sands
of Liberia, and the evangelizing of the millions of the Mahometans and pagans that inhabit
the interior of that extensive country?

We are constrained to believe that the welfare of the people of color, to say the least, is
but a secondary consideration with those engaged in the colonization project. Or why should
we be requested to move to Africa, and thus separated from all we hold dear in a moral point
of view, before their christian benevolence can be exercised in our behalf? Surely there is
no country of which we have any knowledge, that offers greater facilities for the improvement
of the unlearned; or where benevolent and philanthropic individuals can find a people, whose
situation has greater claims on their christian sympathies, than the people of color. But whilst
we behold a settled determination on the part of the American Colonization Society to remove
us to Liberia, without using any means to better our condition at home, we are compelled to
look with fearful diffidence on every measure of that institution. At a meeting held on the
7th inst. in this borough, the people of color were politely invited to attend, the object
of which was to induce the most respectable part of them to emigrate. The meeting was addressed
by several reverend gentlemen, and very flattering accounts given on the authority of letters
and statements said to have been received from individuals of unquestionable veracity. But
we beg leave to say, that those statements differ so widely from letters that we have seen
of recent date from the colony, in regard to the condition and circumstances of the colonists,
that we are compelled in truth to say that we cannot reconcile such contradictory statements,
and are therefore inclined to doubt the former, as they appear to have been prepared to present
to the public, for the purpose of enlisting the feelings of our white friends into the measure,
and of inducing the enterprising part of the colored community to emigrate at their own expense.
That we are in this country a degraded people, we are truly sensible; that our forlorn situation
is not attributable to ourselves is admitted by the most ardent friends of colonization; and
that our condition cannot be bettered by removing the most exemplary individuals of color from
amongst us, we are well convinced, from the consideration that in the same ratio that the industrious
part would emigrate, in the same proportion those who would remain would become more degraded,
wretched and miserable, and consequently less capable of appreciating the many opportunities
which are now offering for the moral and intellectual improvement of our brethren. The force at disposal

 We wish, therefore,
to be understood, that we highly approve of the evangelizing of Africa, but disapprove of the
present measures of the American Colonization Society, if their motives have not been misrepresented
by their agents and others, in some previous addresses in this city and elsewhere. But viewing
them as we now do, we must say that, in our opinion, their false representations of our general
character--their recommending our removal from our native land--their opposition to our having
a part of the West appointed to us--their objections to our proposed college, and of our march
to science--their false statements in relation to the health of the colony at Liberia, with
a variety of other subjects of the same nature--all lead to a conclusion, that it is our greatest
foe.

We would here ask the public a few questions. First--Is the gospel of Jesus Christ calculated
to lead to insurrectionary measures? If so, why then send it to the heathen? Second--What gentleman,
who has set his slaves free, has been murdered by them for so doing? Third--What have those
States, who have washed their hands clean of the cursed stain of slavery, lost by it? Fourth--What
neighborhood, where education and general information have been disseminated among the people
of color, is the worse for it?

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to prepare an address to be published in the Liberator.

Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be signed by the Chairman and Secretary, and
forwarded to the editor of the Liberator for publication.

                        SAMUEL JOHNSTON, Chairman. This is the land of our
birth. The Declaration of Independence declares, that 'all men are born
free and equal:' it does not say that the white man or the black man
is free,--but all, without respect to color, tongues, or nation. We
therefore consider all laws to enslave or degrade the people of color as
contrary to the letter and spirit of this Declaration; and that
according to it we are freemen, and have as indisputable a right to
enjoy our liberty as any white man. To deny it to us, because we differ
in color, is oppression. To say that Africa is our native country is
untrue. Here we were born, and here we mean to die; for all men are born
free.

We wish to return our grateful thanks to our friends, and to the friends of the abolition of
slavery. We consider slavery a national sin, which, if not speedily overthrown, will cause
this nation to mourn and weep; for God has declared that Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hands
unto him, and he will hear her cry.

We would say to colonizationists that we consider them our foes instead of our friends. It
is vain for them to say that we would do better in Liberia; for we do not believe it. There
is room enough in this country for us; and if they be our friends, let them meliorate our condition
here. Let them join in the work of immediate abolition of slavery. Let them wash out the stains
which disfigure the national character. And then let them tell us about Liberia.

One reason why we are opposed to leaving these United States is this: you have so long denied
us the enjoyment and protection of the laws of God and man in this country, that you wish now
to oppress us still more. But thanks be to Him who holds all things in his hand, we believe
He will plead our cause. Your skirts are already dyed with the blood of millions of souls.
'Vengeance is mine--I will repay,' saith the Lord.

Awake, ye wolves in sheep's clothing. Your cup is now full. You are daily causing innocent
blood to be shed. How long, ye slavites, ye kidnappers, ye that traffic in human flesh, will
you sleep? When will you awake to your best interests? For remember that you will not always
be able to hold your victims in servile chains.

A VOICE FROM NEW-BEDFORD.

                        NEW-BEDFORD, January 23, 1832.

At a meeting of the people of color in New-Bedford, January 23d, for the purpose of considering
and giving their opinion of the American Colonization Society, and the actual evil or benefit
of that Society to the objects of its supervision, the free people of color, Mr Richard Johnson
was called to the chair, and Richard G. Overing appointed secretary. After an address from
the chair, it was moved that resolutions expressive of the views of the meeting, respecting
the Colonization Society, be drawn up, and published in some newspaper not adverse to the rights
and well being of all men, be their color what it may. The following are the resolves of the
meeting:

Resolved, That in whatever light we view the Colonization Society, we discover nothing in it
but terror, prejudice and oppression; that the warm and beneficent hand of philanthropy is
not apparent in the system, but the influence of the Society on public opinion is more prejudicial
to the interest and welfare of the people of color in the United States, than slavery itself.

Resolved, That the Society, to effect its purpose, the removal of the free people of color,
(not the slaves) through its agents, teaches the public to believe that it is patriotic and
benevolent to withhold from us knowledge and the means of acquiring subsistence, and to look
upon us as unnatural and illegal residents in this country; and thus by force of prejudice,
if not by law, endeavor to compel us to embark for Africa, and that too, apparently, by our
own free will and consent.

Resolved, That as great a nuisance as we may be in the estimation of that Society, we yet have
a hope in Him who has seen fit to continue our existence through days worse than which we do
not fear, and which emboldens us as peaceable citizens, to resolve to abide the issue of coming
days in our native land, in which we ask no more than the age in which we live demands, and
which this nation, as republicans and christians, should not refuse to grant.

Signed in behalf of the meeting.

                        RICHARD JOHNSON, Chairman.

R. G. OVERING, Secretary.

The foregoing resolutions and addresses are given in plain, it may be occasionally in severe
language; and display an intensity of feeling, a depth of abhorrence, and a firmness of purpose,
honorable to men who appreciate their rights and love their country. Before I proceed, however,
to comment upon these important proceedings, I shall make some quotations from the essays and
addresses of colored writers, in order to sustain my assertion that the American Colonization
Society is directly opposed to the wishes of our free colored population.

'A COLORED BALTIMOREAN'[AH] records his sentiments in the following style:

    'We believe, sirs, that the people of color in the United States
    will never be prevailed over to abandon the land of their birth,
    and every thing vernacular with them--to forego many advantages
    which they now possess, and many more which they have in
    prospect, for the imaginary, or if real, the fleeting and
    short-lived honors held out to them by our "Americo-African
    empire." Slavery have been get than a points was established, them

     But let them not anticipate too much; they have yet one
    obstacle to overcome which threatens to overthrow their
    "baseless fabric;" or at any rate impede their progress. Their
    proceedings have not obtained the approbation of those, whose
    approbation is most needed, the colored people themselves.
    They are most strangely mistaken if they suppose that it is an
    easy matter to win them, either by sophistry or force. The
    press has begun its revolutionizing work, overturning in its
    progress every thing calculated to suppress inquiry or to blind
    the understanding. Already have the intrigues of the designing
    been exposed, and already have the colored people set their
    faces against oppression.

    'The Colonization Society has erred in matters of policy; for
    instead of exerting themselves to gain the confidence of the
    colored people, and thus by persuasion to have rid the country
    of them, they have acted in a manner calculated to disgust every
    humane mind, and have rendered it an utter impossibility to
    remove them; and it is most fortunate for the unfortunate, that
    they have detected those intriguing spirits in their humane
    and charitable undertaking.

    'How many hours of anguish, how much incalculable misery has been
    prevented; in short, how many human beings have been saved from
    an untimely grave, by the timely interposition of the PRESS! It
    has said, let it be so, and it was so; its thunders have been
    heard, and the oppressor trembles like the earthquake: it has
    overthrown, yea, totally demolished the sharp-edged sword of
    the Colonization Society.

    'Support the PRESS then, ye people of color, and the result will
    be a total overthrow of all the darling schemes of the aforesaid
    darling Society; it has accomplished wonders, yea, wonders
    already; much more can, nay, will be done; again I say, support
    the PRESS.'[AN]

    'The African Colonization Society declares that we the people of
    color shall have no part nor lot in the free institutions of
    this country. Why? Because the Creator of all--the sovereign
    Ruler of the universe, who holds in his hands the destiny of
    nations, thought fit and proper, in his infinite wisdom, to
    tincture us with a darker hue than the paler part of community!
    or, if I may say, because the lot of our predecessors happened
    to be cast in the torrid zone, beneath the scorching beams of a
    vertical sun! These are the objections the African Colonization
    Society offer to this community to our remaining in this
    country--in the land of freemen! These are the considerations
    that prompt them to tell us that we the descendants of Africa
    can never be men unless we abandon the land of our birth, our
    homes and people, and submit to that uncongenial clime, the
    barbarous regions of Africa, amidst unyielding contagion and
    mortality! O, that man would remember, that knowledge and
    virtue, not complexion, are the emblems that constitute the
    value of human dignity! With these, we are worthy--without them,
    we are unworthy. By the acts and operations of wicked men,
    shielded under a cloak of religion, we the people of color are
    doomed to all the miseries that the human body is able to
    sustain--deprived of light, knowledge and social intercourse, by
    the colonization gentlemen. With all their pretended zeal and
    love of liberty, manifested towards the African race, I count
    them as enemies, not friends. I do not solicit their love, nor
    regard their friendship. I speak for one: I never did, and never
    will court an enemy as a friend, knowingly, let him be whom he
    may--let him belong to church or state, I feel the weight of
    their predominant power, and the finishing blow they are about
    to strike. Thus we move by them, poor and pennyless, despised
    and forsaken by all; creeping through your streets, submissively
    bowed down to every foot whose skin is tinctured with a lighter
    hue than ours--thus we sojourn in solitude, not for our crimes
    but color.

    'I came here for the purpose of showing to this community, that
    the people of color of the United States disapprove of the
    African Colonization plan. They do not wish to emigrate to
    Africa. These six hundred or more, that the gentleman tells you
    are now waiting for a passage to Liberia, are not the free
    people of color of the United States; they are, if any, the
    poor, old, worn-out southern slaves, freed on the condition to
    go to Africa, or die in the tracks of slavery, no more fit for
    their cotton and rice fields--for the laws of those states
    forbid the master, let him be possessed of all the fine feelings
    that the human mind is able to contain; unless he banishes them
    to some distant region, across that "mighty ocean" they speak
    of, they cannot be free. According to the laws of those states,
    and the basis on which the Society is built, the emancipated
    slaves are not free until they stand upon the shores of Liberia.
    Thus the Northern and Middle States are called upon for
    donations to enable the monarch of the south to bury his slaves
    in the sands of Africa; thus far, northern capital is
    instrumental in parting asunder parents and children--no more to
    meet, until Jehovah will stand upon the four corners of the
    earth, and proclaim deliverance to the captive!--when the arm of
    tyrants shall cease to sway the rod of tyranny over the heads of
    their helpless children--until all creation shall vanish and
    crumble into nothing.

    'About the time of the formation of this Society, the people of
    color, in different sections of the Union, took the alarm--they
    thought there was something wrong in the views of that combined
    body. So, the free people of color of Richmond, convened
    themselves together in the state of Virginia, where the
    gentleman says the African Colonization Society first
    originated. They assembled themselves together for the purpose
    of ascertaining each other's feelings with regard to that
    combined body, and after mature reflection, they petitioned
    Congress--I will give you the words of their memorial, which are
    sufficient evidence to substantiate in the mind of every
    rational person, that the people of color wish to remain in this
    country.

    '"At a meeting of a respectable portion of the free people of
    color of the city of Richmond, on Friday, January 24, 1817,
    William Bowler was appointed chairman, and Lentey Craw,
    secretary. The following preamble and resolution were read,
    unanimously adopted, and ordered to be printed.

    '"Whereas a Society has been formed at the seat of government,
    for the purpose of colonizing, with their own consent, the free
    people of color of the United States; therefore we, the free
    people of color of the city of Richmond, have thought it
    advisable to assemble together under the sanction of authority,
    for the purpose of making a public expression of our sentiments

    illustrated in registry that i is consequently before action,
    and they adopt artillery from brethren to day.
     And we
    tell her, look at their returning! We took them barbarous,
    though measurably free,--untaught--rude--without
    science--without the true religion--without philosophy--and
    strangers to the best civil governments. And now we return them
    to her bosom, with the mechanical arts ... with science ...
    with philosophy ... with civilization ... with republican
    feelings ... and above all, with the true knowledge of the true
    God, and the way of salvation through the Redeemer.'

'The mechanical arts!'--with whom did they serve an apprenticeship? 'With philosophy!'--in
what colleges were they taught? It is strange that we should be so anxious to get rid of these
scientific men of color--these philosophers--these republicans--these christians, and that
we should shun their company as if they were afflicted with the hydrophobia, or carried a deadly
pestilence in their train! Certainly, they must have singular notions of the christian religion
which tolerates--or, rather, which is so perverted as to tolerate--the oppression of God's
rational creatures by its professors! They must feel a peculiar kind of brotherly love for
those good men who banded together to remove them to Africa, because they were too proud to
associate familiarly with men of a sable complexion! But the writer proceeds:

    'We tell her, look at the little colony on her shores. We tell
    her, look to the consequences that must flow to all her borders
    from religion, and science, and knowledge, and civilization, and
    republican government! And then we ask her--is not one ship
    load of emigrants returning with these multiplied blessings,
    worth more to her than a million of her barbarous sons?'

So! every ship load of ignorant and helpless emigrants is to more than compensate Africa for
every million of her children who have been kidnapped, buried in the ocean and on the land,
tortured with savage cruelty, and held in perpetual servitude! Truly, this is a compendious
method of balancing accounts. In the sight of God, of Africa, and of the world, we are consequently
blameless--and rather praiseworthy--for our past transgressions. It is such sophistry as is
contained in the foregoing extract, that kindles my indignation into a blaze. I abhor cant--I
abhor hypocrisy--and if some of the advocates of the Colonization Society do not deal largely
in both, I am unable to comprehend the meaning of these terms.

Of the whole number of individuals constituting the officers of the Society, nearly three-fourths,
I believe, are the owners of slaves, or interested in slave property; not one of whom, to my
knowledge, has emancipated any of his slaves to be sent to Liberia!! The President of the Society,
(CHARLES CARROLL,) owns, I have understood, nearly one thousand slaves! And yet he is lauded,
beyond measure, as a patriot, a philanthropist, and a christian! The former President, (Judge
BUSHROD WASHINGTON,) so far from breaking the fetters of his slaves, actually while holding
his office offered a large reward for a runaway female slave, to any person who would secure
her by putting her into any jail within the United States! What a mockery it is for such persons
to profess to deplore the existence of slavery, or to denounce the foreign slave trade! for
they neither cease from their own oppressive acts, nor act much more honestly than the slave
dealers--the latter stealing those who are born on the coast of Africa, and the former those
who are born in this country!
