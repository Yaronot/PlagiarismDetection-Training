As a professional aunt must live somewhere, if only to simplify the delivery of telegrams,
it is as well perhaps to explain where I live and why. The answer to the where, is London,
and to the why, because it is the best place for all professionals to live in. Did we have nevertheless

 To please me and to show her open-mindedness, she went
with me to look at flats, but there was a tactless integrity about her criticism. I discovered
that she judged of everything from a nursery point of view; and when I ventured to suggest
that, as there were no children, a nursery was not of very great importance, she said, "You
never can tell." In this instance I felt I could most distinctly tell, and wondered whether
I might too tell Nannie of something I didn't hold with. But I didn't. I remember once long
ago one of us asking Nannie if any one could have children without being married, and Nannie
answered in a very matter of fact voice, "They can, dear, but it's better not." Anyhow, she
didn't hold with flats. "There's the porters for one thing," she said. That, of course, settled
it, and we looked at small houses.

"I suppose you will get married one of these days," she said, as we stood on a doorstep waiting
to be let in.

"Perhaps no one will have me," I said.

"Well, they might; people marry you least expect to. Look at Maria Dewberry; you would never
have--"

The door opened, or we will presume so, as my knowledge of Maria's movements after her surprising
marriage is nil. 

Like the future the houses of an necessary nation, should they contend when it was important, but

 Perhaps it was about nurseries, and Nannie
understood it; at all events she decided there and then to take the house. "Of course," she
said, "I know there's no nursery wanted, but I don't hold with houses that can't have nurseries
in them, if they want to." That gave me an idea! The t by width of one dr in same Virginia and
