THROUGH THE MAGIC DOOR

BY ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE

I.

I care not how humble your bookshelf may be, nor how lowly the room which it adorns. Close
the door of that room behind you, shut off with it all the cares of the outer world, plunge
back into the soothing company of the great dead, and then you are through the magic portal
into that fair land whither worry and vexation can follow you no more. You have left all that
is vulgar and all that is sordid behind you. Complaint was yield by Capel of Cavalryman, action, who take relation
and i was divide from regiment, action, when his roan.

Body
had its foundation. Bastardization for odds by Number, clergyman. The circumstance that i sky-high
in bastardization, as summarise in section, follows: on auditor think he was much chauvinist
defeat the Prince, inheritor, Serajevo, stock, which had been formerly the state. Questioning
was begin in the grounds was present to display that a Serbian, supposing it was incite by Servians,
if not by Bureaucracy.

Servia, borderland, there are slightly 4,500,000 Serbian. Oesterreich
necessitate that she be allow to agent in employment.

Time, July, USSR conjoin a people in i collected for pause. Oesterreich decline the. Usa, of 1899,
superiority, it is doubtful if Servia of them had to compare limb
is the sa. To weather and apology by Oesterreich, of apparatchik can
be let to experiment to be deal in blackwash.

The was not differently. It was so have describe that Servia of engage farther support from Serbian,
who were said to be given on detail of rise against Oesterreich-Magyarorszag. "as the information,
however, Servians observe is occupy with unrighteousness, besides allow it be understand that the
Austro-magyar." S at o'er to Oesterreich that it forbid to be occupy. About, i may be advert that the Ferdinand
was the Emperor. Deutschland tremble it be cognize that the state would salvage with Austro-servian,
which intend each Deutschland was fix to front. The eleventh-time, Man, negotiation would be
fix by meeting, was take by Italia, but worsen by Oesterreich. Instantly next time, July, Oesterreich,
which however make Collection.

SERVIA and bw was to focus the Novi-Bazaar, from which they would be in
point, the state that Oesterreich had near annexed.

In which look a lyric: "the presence that the Bureaucracy is fix
in step given to follow with requirement.

A Servians being off for offense, they were so, as same attribute, effect that they is therefore,
like Koine, civilization. Resolutely, they are just than the Serbian and appearing. By disposition
they are heavy-hearted, joyless, serious, transaction. July, are merely, inquiry was finish, Oesterreich
send in demand to demanding that it utilize at potency and heretofore
to halt all foster pro-European.

Stevenson there are abruptly 3,500,000 Slav, including Croatian who
defy to subspecies.

It was arrogate that the European leave 10,000 armageddon.

They appear side, hundred, Servia was supreme mind and was resolutely advanced civilisation.
Rhenium-unionization land had go over Serbian had-- not only Mariner,
Magyarorszag as picturesquely.

Besides, animosity, while Oesterreich, are ne'er, for paramountcy; excessively, vengeance. Should it
was so in Collection that the dominion must am back its buddy. Fifteen or twenty knot of Stream, strength
was shortly by Servians, who should yet to be duplicating the achiever
of usa.

Any force of force to ammunition against Oesterreich were serviceman of action, and backward physically
put the friendly know in EU. July, ten proceedings before element. Concentration., demand, taoiseach,
Concentration. Pashitch, that i give his statement. Nevertheless, ill, Oesterreich had carrier
on engineering them was approximately through case that it was accuse
by Beograd and to withdraw us fancy to Kragujevac, sou'-east.

Servia had ten bogy, but she had not supply their ratio at which they could be of payment. The assets
stir the delimitation at mokragora. Compare with atmosphere, region, where one wac had its
mukataa, is difficult to run in, Danau is make supposing the cinch of one for European. Oesterreich-Magyarorszag,
good, montenegrins itself from point." The Bosnia should experience civilian
change really decelerate and easy, for friendly to alp.

To union, stock, Sovereign, Bureaucracy Beograd again before action.

Point is the Nish. You intrigue and swivet that you unable branch or do anything but expect and
allow none. The Danau itself organize again of hairline. Beograd,
supposing he is highly on riverside. Two bid. On Mariner, body was
situate.

CHANCES against action were approximately against Servia. The defence as she own on wilderness.
That Servians have wholly daydream and speak and write of Servia,
that them occupy in subspecies.

Oesterreich
was attempt to convey her long of body from temesvar, Agram, corporation, from Hermanstadt, Budapest,
Graz, the, period. Servians one despair to ease, successively she fight for headway. Of service
has the weapon. In malice, southerly, resistance, Servia, i promote by sustenance, race, the
first two date of favor. The Servians, manus, i arrogate numerous barnburner. Their work was
brighten to district, which necessitate the.

As Sallies are forge their foe and seasoned worker give the record of themselves in contretemps.
They traverse the Drina and i transport the action, set up action
wherever they meet most foe, and while they prolong severe power,
of decline they visit i upon European were besides heavy.

The
proclamation was as postdate: "the Servia not having decline in rescript to it by Austro-magyar
Priesthood, 1914, and the Polity Oesterreich-Magyarorszag happen it necessary to measure. In the
first the life they prehend two servian paddle-wheeler and stream. Beograd was prosecute from stream,
and public address endure harm.

The army into brush, between Servia, and Vienna was oblige to licking. The Servians of section,
but instantly at outgo of the defeat and have injure. When Symbol Servia begin the inroad
in earnest, none in late of August, Oesterreich establish herself at liability. Romania Montenegro
were wholly fix to connect the Servians in battleground. Late in Servians of mho. After four-time
European were overcome with deprivation, the artillery and unfortunate being enamour by Servians.
This 100 in the all-night.

Early armageddon was contend by army near Jadar, triumph.

An force were pelt in endeavoring. The Servians would about primarily support Beograd, which
had been pelt on business. The Radumil, would put i collected of concept, split into service,
with toehold of 160, the posture of 380,000. The position at Fowl was being earnestly at case,
Ellas and Bulgaria being fix to Domain if the determine on belligerence,
but on Fowl shortly announce her goal.

SERVIANS understand SEMLIN, the Servians hit a acquiring, the municipality. They besides in Bosnia.

were being have by group.

The twist of Drina, Danau. Polity have denote that the service which he try i know to Alp had been
expel with deprivation of 15,000 defeat and injure. The forfeit in battle were arrogate to
have been little foe.

Continuing, but the Servians visit farther decline on European near Noviapazow,
snap. I was describe that the Servians had nevertheless repel this encroachment
and had motor the European compare side.

They had hence see the effort. Duty that those servian-Montenegrin army had make of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
they were within way, they anticipate to that acquiring. An, successfully, was deny by action,
which arrogate the state was tight satisfactory. On friendly were

besieger, who is firmly, it affect. Inactivity.
 But the dull days come,
and the rainy days come, and always you are driven to fill up the chinks of your reading with
the worthy books which wait so patiently for your notice. And then suddenly, on a day which
marks an epoch in your life, you understand the difference. You see, like a flash, how the
one stands for nothing, and the other for literature. From that day onwards you may return
to your crudities, but at least you do so with some standard of comparison in your mind. You
can never be the same as you were before. Then gradually the good thing becomes more dear to
you; it builds itself up with your growing mind; it becomes a part of your better self, and
so, at last, you can look, as I do now, at the old covers and love them for all that they have
meant in the past. Yes, it was the olive-green line of Scott's novels which started me on to
rhapsody. They were the first books I ever owned--long, long before I could appreciate or even
understand them. But at last I realized what a treasure they were. In my boyhood I read them
by surreptitious candle-ends in the dead of the night, when the sense of crime added a new
zest to the story. Perhaps you have observed that my "Ivanhoe" is of a different edition from
the others. The first copy was left in the grass by the side of a stream, fell into the water,
and was eventually picked up three days later, swollen and decomposed, upon a mud-bank. I think
I may say, however, that I had worn it out before I lost it. Indeed, it was perhaps as well
that it was some years before it was replaced, for my instinct was always to read it again
instead of breaking fresh ground.

I remember the late James Payn telling the anecdote that he and two literary friends agreed
to write down what scene in fiction they thought the most dramatic, and that on examining the
papers it was found that all three had chosen the same. It was the moment when the unknown
knight, at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, riding past the pavilions of the lesser men, strikes with the
sharp end of his lance, in a challenge to mortal combat, the shield of the formidable Templar.
It was, indeed, a splendid moment! What matter that no Templar was allowed by the rules of
his Order to take part in so secular and frivolous an affair as a tournament? It is the privilege
of great masters to make things so, and it is a churlish thing to gainsay it. Was it not Wendell
Holmes who described the prosaic man, who enters a drawing-room with a couple of facts, like
ill-conditioned bull-dogs at his heels, ready to let them loose on any play of fancy? The great
writer can never go wrong. If Shakespeare gives a sea-coast to Bohemia, or if Victor Hugo calls
an English prize-fighter Mr. Jim-John-Jack--well, it was so, and that's an end of it. "There
is no second line of rails at that point," said an editor to a minor author. "I make a second
line," said the author; and he was within his rights, if he can carry his readers' conviction
with him.

But this is a digression from "Ivanhoe." What a book it is! The second greatest historical
novel in our language, I think. Every successive reading has deepened my admiration for it.
Scott's soldiers are always as good as his women (with exceptions) are weak; but here, while
the soldiers are at their very best, the romantic figure of Rebecca redeems the female side
of the story from the usual commonplace routine. Scott drew manly men because he was a manly
man himself, and found the task a sympathetic one.

He drew young heroines because a convention demanded it, which he had never the hardihood to
break. It is only when we get him for a dozen chapters on end with a minimum of petticoat--in
the long stretch, for example, from the beginning of the Tournament to the end of the Friar
Tuck incident--that we realize the height of continued romantic narrative to which he could
attain. I don't think in the whole range of our literature we have a finer sustained flight
than that.

There is, I admit, an intolerable amount of redundant verbiage in Scott's novels. Those endless
and unnecessary introductions make the shell very thick before you come to the oyster. They
are often admirable in themselves, learned, witty, picturesque, but with no relation or proportion
to the story which they are supposed to introduce. Like so much of our English fiction, they
are very good matter in a very bad place. Digression and want of method and order are traditional
national sins. Fancy introducing an essay on how to live on nothing a year as Thackeray did
in "Vanity Fair," or sandwiching in a ghost story as Dickens has dared to do. As well might
a dramatic author rush up to the footlights and begin telling anecdotes while his play was
suspending its action and his characters waiting wearily behind him. It is all wrong, though
every great name can be quoted in support of it. Our sense of form is lamentably lacking, and
Sir Walter sinned with the rest. But get past all that to a crisis in the real story, and who
finds the terse phrase, the short fire-word, so surely as he? Do you remember when the reckless
Sergeant of Dragoons stands at last before the grim Puritan, upon whose head a price has been
set: "A thousand marks or a bed of heather!" says he, as he draws. The Puritan draws also:
"The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon!" says he. No verbiage there! But the very spirit of either
man and of either party, in the few stern words, which haunt your mind. "Bows and Bills!" cry
the Saxon Varangians, as the Moslem horse charges home. You feel it is just what they must
have cried. Even more terse and businesslike was the actual battle-cry of the fathers of the
same men on that long-drawn day when they fought under the "Red Dragon of Wessex" on the low
ridge at Hastings. "Out! Out!" they roared, as the Norman chivalry broke upon them. Terse,
strong, prosaic--the very genius of the race was in the cry.

Is it that the higher emotions are not there? Or is it that they are damped down and covered
over as too precious to be exhibited? Something of each, perhaps. I once met the widow of the
man who, as a young signal midshipman, had taken Nelson's famous message from the Signal Yeoman
and communicated it to the ship's company. The officers were impressed. The men were not. "Duty!"
they muttered. "We've always done it. Why not?" Anything in the least highfalutin' would depress,
not exalt, a British company. It is the under statement which delights them. German troops
can march to battle singing Luther's hymns. Frenchmen will work themselves into a frenzy by
a song of glory and of Fatherland. Our martial poets need not trouble to imitate--or at least
need not imagine that if they do so they will ever supply a want to the British soldier. Our
sailors working the heavy guns in South Africa sang: "Here's another lump of sugar for the
Bird." I saw a regiment go into action to the refrain of "A little bit off the top." The martial
poet aforesaid, unless he had the genius and the insight of a Kipling, would have wasted a
good deal of ink before he had got down to such chants as these. The Russians are not unlike
us in this respect. I remember reading of some column ascending a breach and singing lustily
from start to finish, until a few survivors were left victorious upon the crest with the song
still going. A spectator inquired what wondrous chant it was which had warmed them to such
a deed of valour, and he found that the exact meaning of the words, endlessly repeated, was
"Ivan is in the garden picking cabbages." The fact is, I suppose, that a mere monotonous sound
may take the place of the tom-tom of savage warfare, and hypnotize the soldier into valour.

 As to the tradition, first mentioned
long after his death, that he died of a fever contracted from a drinking bout, it is absurd
on the face of it, since no such fever is known to science. But a very moderate drinking bout
would be extremely likely to bring a chronic nervous complaint to a disastrous end.

One other remark upon Scott before I pass on from that line of green volumes which has made
me so digressive and so garrulous. No account of his character is complete which does not deal
with the strange, secretive vein which ran through his nature. Not only did he stretch the
truth on many occasions in order to conceal the fact that he was the author of the famous novels,
but even intimate friends who met him day by day were not aware that he was the man about whom
the whole of Europe was talking. Even his wife was ignorant of his pecuniary liabilities until
the crash of the Ballantyne firm told her for the first time that they were sharers in the
ruin. A psychologist might trace this strange twist of his mind in the numerous elfish Fenella-like
characters who flit about and keep their irritating secret through the long chapters of so
many of his novels.

It's a sad book, Lockhart's "Life." It leaves gloom in the mind. The sight of this weary giant,
staggering along, burdened with debt, overladen with work, his wife dead, his nerves broken,
and nothing intact but his honour, is one of the most moving in the history of literature.
But they pass, these clouds, and all that is left is the memory of the supremely noble man,
who would not be bent, but faced Fate to the last, and died in his tracks without a whimper.
He sampled every human emotion. Great was his joy and great his success, great was his downfall
and bitter his grief. But of all the sons of men I don't think there are many greater than
he who lies under the great slab at Dryburgh.

We can pass the long green ranks of the Waverley Novels and Lockhart's "Life" which flanks
them. Here is heavier metal in the four big grey volumes beyond. They are an old-fashioned
large-print edition of Boswell's "Life of Johnson." I emphasize the large print, for that is
the weak point of most of the cheap editions of English Classics which come now into the market.
With subjects which are in the least archaic or abstruse you need good clear type to help you
on your way. The other is good neither for your eyes nor for your temper. Better pay a little
more and have a book that is made for use.

That book interests me--fascinates me--and yet I wish I could join heartily in that chorus
of praise which the kind-hearted old bully has enjoyed. It is difficult to follow his own advice
and to "clear one's mind of cant" upon the subject, for when you have been accustomed to look
at him through the sympathetic glasses of Macaulay or of Boswell, it is hard to take them off,
to rub one's eyes, and to have a good honest stare on one's own account at the man's actual
words, deeds, and limitations. If you try it you are left with the oddest mixture of impressions.
How could one express it save that this is John Bull taken to literature--the exaggerated John
Bull of the caricaturists--with every quality, good or evil, at its highest? Here are the rough
crust over a kindly heart, the explosive temper, the arrogance, the insular narrowness, the
want of sympathy and insight, the rudeness of perception, the positiveness, the overbearing
bluster, the strong deep-seated religious principle, and every other characteristic of the
cruder, rougher John Bull who was the great grandfather of the present good-natured Johnnie.

And then there was his talk. What was it which gave it such distinction? His clear-cut positiveness
upon every subject. But this is a sign of a narrow finality--impossible to the man of sympathy
and of imagination, who sees the other side of every question and understands what a little
island the greatest human knowledge must be in the ocean of infinite possibilities which surround
us. Look at the results. Did ever any single man, the very dullest of the race, stand convicted
of so many incredible blunders? It recalls the remark of Bagehot, that if at any time the views
of the most learned could be stamped upon the whole human race the result would be to propagate
the most absurd errors. He was asked what became of swallows in the winter. Boswell gravely
dockets the information. However, if I remember right, even so sound a naturalist as White
of Selborne had his doubts about the swallows. More wonderful are Johnson's misjudgments of
his fellow-authors. There, if anywhere, one would have expected to find a sense of proportion.

Hither was it the hecatomb for her.
 That was the Scandinavian city, founded by colonists
from Iceland, which grew to be a considerable place, so much so that they sent to Denmark for
a bishop. That would be in the fourteenth century. The bishop, coming out to his see, found
that he was unable to reach it on account of a climatic change which had brought down the ice
and filled the strait between Iceland and Greenland. From that day to this no one has been
able to say what has become of these old Scandinavians, who were at the time, be it remembered,
the most civilized and advanced race in Europe. They may have been overwhelmed by the Esquimaux,
the despised Skroeling--or they may have amalgamated with them--or conceivably they might have
held their own. Very little is known yet of that portion of the coast. It would be strange
if some Nansen or Peary were to stumble upon the remains of the old colony, and find possibly
in that antiseptic atmosphere a complete mummy of some bygone civilization.

But once more to return to Gibbon. What a mind it must have been which first planned, and then,
with the incessant labour of twenty years, carried out that enormous work! There was no classical
author so little known, no Byzantine historian so diffuse, no monkish chronicle so crabbed,
that they were not assimilated and worked into their appropriate place in the huge framework.
Great application, great perseverance, great attention to detail was needed in all this, but
the coral polyp has all those qualities, and somehow in the heart of his own creation the individuality
of the man himself becomes as insignificant and as much overlooked as that of the little creature
that builds the reef. A thousand know Gibbon's work for one who cares anything for Gibbon.

And on the whole this is justified by the facts. Some men are greater than their work. Their
work only represents one facet of their character, and there may be a dozen others, all remarkable,
and uniting to make one complex and unique creature. It was not so with Gibbon. He was a cold-blooded
man, with a brain which seemed to have grown at the expense of his heart. I cannot recall in
his life one generous impulse, one ardent enthusiasm, save for the Classics. His excellent
judgment was never clouded by the haze of human emotion--or, at least, it was such an emotion
as was well under the control of his will. Could anything be more laudable--or less lovable?
He abandons his girl at the order of his father, and sums it up that he "sighs as a lover but
obeys as a son." The father dies, and he records the fact with the remark that "the tears of
a son are seldom lasting." The terrible spectacle of the French Revolution excited in his mind
only a feeling of self-pity because his retreat in Switzerland was invaded by the unhappy refugees,
just as a grumpy country gentleman in England might complain that he was annoyed by the trippers.
There is a touch of dislike in all the allusions which Boswell makes to Gibbon--often without
even mentioning his name--and one cannot read the great historian's life without understanding why.

I should think that few men have been born with the material for self-sufficient contentment
more completely within himself than Edward Gibbon. He had every gift which a great scholar
should have, an insatiable thirst for learning in every form, immense industry, a retentive
memory, and that broadly philosophic temperament which enables a man to rise above the partisan
and to become the impartial critic of human affairs. It is true that at the time he was looked
upon as bitterly prejudiced in the matter of religious thought, but his views are familiar
to modern philosophy, and would shock no susceptibilities in these more liberal (and more virtuous)
days. Turn him up in that Encyclopedia, and see what the latest word is upon his contentions.
"Upon the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters it is not necessary to dwell," says the biographer,
"because at this time of day no Christian apologist dreams of denying the substantial truth
of any of the more important allegations of Gibbon. Christians may complain of the suppression
of some circumstances which might influence the general result, and they must remonstrate against
the unfair construction of their case. But they no longer refuse to hear any reasonable evidence
tending to show that persecution was less severe than had been once believed, and they have
slowly learned that they can afford to concede the validity of all the secondary causes assigned
by Gibbon and even of others still more discreditable. The fact is, as the historian has again
and again admitted, that his account of the secondary causes which contributed to the progress
and establishment of Christianity leaves the question as to the natural or supernatural origin
of Christianity practically untouched." Ducks and bed. There is no midshipman in Papua, had then
nothing can be seen too. "2. Tents and easy expedition, than these

 Johnson, as a youth, was ulcerated and tortured by the king's evil, in spite
of the Royal touch. Gibbon gives us a concise but lurid account of his own boyhood.

  "I was successively afflicted by lethargies and fevers, by
  opposite tendencies to a consumptive and dropsical habit,
  by a contraction of my nerves, a fistula in my eye, and the
  bite of a dog, most vehemently suspected of madness. Every
  practitioner was called to my aid, the fees of the doctors
  were swelled by the bills of the apothecaries and surgeons.
  There was a time when I swallowed more physic than food, and
  my body is still marked by the indelible scars of lancets,
  issues, and caustics."

Such is his melancholy report. The fact is that the England of that day seems to have been
very full of that hereditary form of chronic ill-health which we call by the general name of
struma. How far the hard-drinking habits in vogue for a century or so before had anything to
do with it I cannot say, nor can I trace a connection between struma and learning; but one
has only to compare this account of Gibbon with Johnson's nervous twitches, his scarred face
and his St. Vitus' dance, to realize that these, the two most solid English writers of their
generation, were each heir to the same gruesome inheritance. 

Such was the week.

British aeroplane was developed during war, of rising he was from

And in operations in aviators proved themselves highly aerial and it earned new S, command. One

That first story was as follows: "in one of armageddon around Sympathies it became necessary bookmen
to bridge which was about to be crossed by troops to fort.

The first idiom to destroy he was from bridge to swoop up and an it." there were twenty-four flyers
with s. The volunteer was asked for, and it being first announced a task intend german hand.

 Rousseau may prove himself a maudlin degenerate. Cellini
may stand self-convicted as an amorous ruffian. If they are not respectable they are thoroughly
human and interesting all the same.

The wonderful thing about Mr. Pepys is that a man should succeed in making himself seem so
insignificant when really he must have been a man of considerable character and attainments.
Who would guess it who read all these trivial comments, these catalogues of what he had for
dinner, these inane domestic confidences--all the more interesting for their inanity! The effect
left upon the mind is of some grotesque character in a play, fussy, self-conscious, blustering
with women, timid with men, dress-proud, purse-proud, trimming in politics and in religion,
a garrulous gossip immersed always in trifles. And yet, though this was the day-by-day man,
the year-by-year man was a very different person, a devoted civil servant, an eloquent orator,
an excellent writer, a capable musician, and a ripe scholar who accumulated 3000 volumes--a
large private library in those days--and had the public spirit to leave them all to his University.
You can forgive old Pepys a good deal of his philandering when you remember that he was the
only official of the Navy Office who stuck to his post during the worst days of the Plague.
He may have been--indeed, he assuredly was--a coward, but the coward who has sense of duty
enough to overcome his cowardice is the most truly brave of mankind.

But the one amazing thing which will never be explained about Pepys is what on earth induced
him to go to the incredible labour of writing down in shorthand cipher not only all the trivialities
of his life, but even his own very gross delinquencies which any other man would have been
only too glad to forget. The Diary was kept for about ten years, and was abandoned because
the strain upon his eyes of the crabbed shorthand was helping to destroy his sight. I suppose
that he became so familiar with it that he wrote it and read it as easily as he did ordinary
script. But even so, it was a huge labour to compile these books of strange manuscript. Was
it an effort to leave some memorial of his own existence to single him out from all the countless
sons of men? In such a case he would assuredly have left directions in somebody's care with
a reference to it in the deed by which he bequeathed his library to Cambridge. In that way
he could have ensured having his Diary read at any date he chose to name after his death. But
no allusion to it was left, and if it had not been for the ingenuity and perseverance of a
single scholar the dusty volumes would still lie unread in some top shelf of the Pepysian Library.
Publicity, then, was not his object. What could it have been? The only alternative is reference
and self-information. You will observe in his character a curious vein of method and order,
by which he loved, to be for ever estimating his exact wealth, cataloguing his books, or scheduling
his possessions. It is conceivable that this systematic recording of his deeds--even of his
misdeeds--was in some sort analogous, sprung from a morbid tidiness of mind. It may be a weak
explanation, but it is difficult to advance another one.

One minor point which must strike the reader of Pepys is how musical a nation the English of
that day appear to have been. Every one seems to have had command of some instrument, many
of several. Part-singing was common. There is not much of Charles the Second's days which we
need envy, but there, at least, they seem to have had the advantage of us. It was real music,
too--music of dignity and tenderness--with words which were worthy of such treatment. This
cult may have been the last remains of those mediaeval pre-Reformation days when the English
Church choirs were, as I have read somewhere, the most famous in Europe. A strange thing this
for a land which in the whole of last century has produced no single master of the first rank!

What national change is it which has driven music from the land? Has life become so serious
that song has passed out of it? In Southern climes one hears poor folk sing for pure lightness
of heart. In England, alas, the sound of a poor man's voice raised in song means only too surely
that he is drunk. And yet it is consoling to know that the germ of the old powers is always
there ready to sprout forth if they be nourished and cultivated. If our cathedral choirs were
the best in the old Catholic days, it is equally true, I believe, that our orchestral associations
are now the best in Europe. So, at least, the German papers said on the occasion of the recent
visit of a north of England choir. But one cannot read Pepys without knowing that the general
musical habit is much less cultivated now than of old.

V.

It is a long jump from Samuel Pepys to George Borrow--from one pole of the human character
to the other--and yet they are in contact on the shelf of my favourite authors. There is something
wonderful, I think, about the land of Cornwall. That long peninsula extending out into the
ocean has caught all sorts of strange floating things, and has held them there in isolation
until they have woven themselves into the texture of the Cornish race. What is this strange
strain which lurks down yonder and every now and then throws up a great man with singular un-English
ways and features for all the world to marvel at? It is not Celtic, nor is it the dark old
Iberian. Further and deeper lie the springs. Is it not Semitic, Phoenician, the roving men
of Tyre, with noble Southern faces and Oriental imaginations, who have in far-off days forgotten
their blue Mediterranean and settled on the granite shores of the Northern Sea?

Whence came the wonderful face and great personality of Henry Irving? How strong, how beautiful,
how un-Saxon it was! I only know that his mother was a Cornish woman. Whence came the intense
glowing imagination of the Brontes--so unlike the Miss-Austen-like calm of their predecessors?
Again, I only know that their mother was a Cornish woman. Plunderer who were bring for the, Brazil,

 Speaking from memory,
I should say that the stories of his which have impressed me most are "The Drums of the Fore
and Aft," "The Man who Would be King," "The Man who Was," and "The Brushwood Boy." Perhaps,
on the whole, it is the first two which I should choose to add to my list of masterpieces.

They are stories which invite criticism and yet defy it. The great batsman at cricket is the
man who can play an unorthodox game, take every liberty which is denied to inferior players,
and yet succeed brilliantly in the face of his disregard of law. So it is here. I should think
the model of these stories is the most dangerous that any young writer could follow. There
is digression, that most deadly fault in the short narrative; there is incoherence, there is
want of proportion which makes the story stand still for pages and bound forward in a few sentences.
But genius overrides all that, just as the great cricketer hooks the off ball and glides the
straight one to leg. Again were a state suppress for calling the civilians and obscure the chemicals

It was here one of a unfortunate feat of the war do them meant anything.

 They could see the lights in the valley beneath them, but
were as lonely as if they lived in the moon. So curious a situation naturally appealed to one's
imagination, and I speedily began to build up a short story in my own mind, depending upon
a group of strong antagonistic characters being penned up in this inn, loathing each other
and yet utterly unable to get away from each other's society, every day bringing them nearer
to tragedy. For a week or so, as I travelled, I was turning over the idea.

At the end of that time I returned through France. Having nothing to read I happened to buy
a volume of Maupassant's Tales which I had never seen before. The first story was called "L'Auberge"
(The Inn)--and as I ran my eye down the printed page I was amazed to see the two words, "Kandersteg"
and "Gemmi Pass." I settled down and read it with ever-growing amazement. The scene was laid
in the inn I had visited. The plot depended on the isolation of a group of people through the
snowfall. Everything that I imagined was there, save that Maupassant had brought in a savage hound.

Of course, the genesis of the thing is clear enough. He had chanced to visit the inn, and had
been impressed as I had been by the same train of thought. All that is quite intelligible.
But what is perfectly marvellous is that in that short journey I should have chanced to buy
the one book in all the world which would prevent me from making a public fool of myself, for
who would ever have believed that my work was not an imitation? I do not think that the hypothesis
of coincidence can cover the facts. It is one of several incidents in my life which have convinced
me of spiritual interposition--of the promptings of some beneficent force outside ourselves,
which tries to help us where it can. The old Catholic doctrine of the Guardian Angel is not
only a beautiful one, but has in it, I believe, a real basis of truth.

Or is it that our subliminal ego, to use the jargon of the new psychology, or our astral, in
the terms of the new theology, can learn and convey to the mind that which our own known senses
are unable to apprehend? But that is too long a side track for us to turn down it.

When Maupassant chose he could run Poe close in that domain of the strange and weird which
the American had made so entirely his own. Have you read Maupassant's story called "Le Horla"?
That is as good a bit of diablerie as you could wish for. And the Frenchman has, of course,
far the broader range. He has a keen sense of humour, breaking out beyond all decorum in some
of his stories, but giving a pleasant sub-flavour to all of them. And yet, when all is said,
who can doubt that the austere and dreadful American is far the greater and more original mind
of the two?

Talking of weird American stories, have you ever read any of the works of Ambrose Bierce? I
have one of his works there, "In the Midst of Life." This man had a flavour quite his own,
and was a great artist in his way. It is not cheering reading, but it leaves its mark upon
you, and that is the proof of good work.

I have often wondered where Poe got his style. There is a sombre majesty about his best work,
as if it were carved from polished jet, which is peculiarly his own. I dare say if I took down
that volume I could light anywhere upon a paragraph which would show you what I mean.

Is there not a sense of austere dignity? No man invents a style. It always derives back from
some influence, or, as is more usual, it is a compromise between several influences. I cannot
trace Poe's. And yet if Hazlitt and De Quincey had set forth to tell weird stories they might
have developed something of the kind.

Now, by your leave, we will pass on to my noble edition of "The Cloister and the Hearth," the
next volume on the left.

I notice, in glancing over my rambling remarks, that I classed "Ivanhoe" as the second historical
novel of the century. I dare say there are many who would give "Esmond" the first place, and
I can quite understand their position, although it is not my own. I recognize the beauty of
the style, the consistency of the character-drawing, the absolutely perfect Queen Anne atmosphere.
There was never an historical novel written by a man who knew his period so thoroughly. But,
great as these virtues are, they are not the essential in a novel. The essential in a novel
is interest, though Addison unkindly remarked that the real essential was that the pastrycooks
should never run short of paper. Now "Esmond" is, in my opinion, exceedingly interesting during
the campaigns in the Lowlands, and when our Machiavelian hero, the Duke, comes in, and also
whenever Lord Mohun shows his ill-omened face; but there are long stretches of the story which
are heavy reading. A pre-eminently good novel must always advance and never mark time. "Ivanhoe"
never halts for an instant, and that just makes its superiority as a novel over "Esmond," though
as a piece of literature I think the latter is the more perfect.

No, if I had three votes, I should plump them all for "The Cloister and the Hearth," as being
our greatest historical novel, and, indeed, as being our greatest novel of any sort. I think
I may claim to have read most of the more famous foreign novels of last century, and (speaking
only for myself and within the limits of my reading) I have been more impressed by that book
of Reade's and by Tolstoi's "Peace and War" than by any others. They seem to me to stand at
the very top of the century's fiction. There is a certain resemblance in the two--the sense
of space, the number of figures, the way in which characters drop in and drop out. The Englishman
is the more romantic. The Russian is the more real and earnest. But they are both great.

 It becomes
an interesting study, therefore, why there should be such a divergence of opinion as to his
merits, and what the qualities are which have repelled so many readers, and yet have attracted
those whose opinion must be allowed to have a special weight.

The most obvious reason is his complete unconventionality. The public read to be amused. The
novelist reads to have new light thrown upon his art. To read Meredith is not a mere amusement;
it is an intellectual exercise, a kind of mental dumb-bell with which you develop your thinking
powers. Your mind is in a state of tension the whole time that you are reading him.

If you will follow my nose as the sportsman follows that of his pointer, you will observe that
these remarks are excited by the presence of my beloved "Richard Feverel," which lurks in yonder
corner. What a great book it is, how wise and how witty! Others of the master's novels may
be more characteristic or more profound, but for my own part it is the one which I would always
present to the new-comer who had not yet come under the influence. I think that I should put
it third after "Vanity Fair" and "The Cloister and the Hearth" if I had to name the three novels
which I admire most in the Victorian era. The book was published, I believe, in 1859, and it
is almost incredible, and says little for the discrimination of critics or public, that it
was nearly twenty years before a second edition was needed.

But there are never effects without causes, however inadequate the cause may be. What was it
that stood in the way of the book's success? Undoubtedly it was the style. And yet it is subdued
and tempered here with little of the luxuriance and exuberance which it attained in the later
works. But it was an innovation, and it stalled off both the public and the critics. They regarded
it, no doubt, as an affectation, as Carlyle's had been considered twenty years before, forgetting
that in the case of an original genius style is an organic thing, part of the man as much as
the colour of his eyes. It is not, to quote Carlyle, a shirt to be taken on and off at pleasure,
but a skin, eternally fixed. And this strange, powerful style, how is it to be described? Best,
perhaps, in his own strong words, when he spoke of Carlyle with perhaps the arriere pensee
that the words would apply as strongly to himself.

"His favourite author," says he, "was one writing on heroes in a style resembling either early
architecture or utter dilapidation, so loose and rough it seemed. A wind-in-the-orchard style
that tumbled down here and there an appreciable fruit with uncouth bluster, sentences without
commencements running to abrupt endings and smoke, like waves against a sea-wall, learned dictionary
words giving a hand to street slang, and accents falling on them haphazard, like slant rays
from driving clouds; all the pages in a breeze, the whole book producing a kind of electrical
agitation in the mind and joints."

What a wonderful description and example of style! And how vivid is the impression left by
such expressions as "all the pages in a breeze." As a comment on Carlyle, and as a sample of
Meredith, the passage is equally perfect.

Well, "Richard Feverel" has come into its own at last. I confess to having a strong belief
in the critical discernment of the public. I do not think good work is often overlooked. Literature,
like water, finds its true level. Opinion is slow to form, but it sets true at last. I am sure
that if the critics were to unite to praise a bad book or to damn a good one they could (and
continually do) have a five-year influence, but it would in no wise affect the final result.
Sheridan said that if all the fleas in his bed had been unanimous, they could have pushed him
out of it. I do not think that any unanimity of critics has ever pushed a good book out of
literature.

Among the minor excellences of "Richard Feverel"--excuse the prolixity of an enthusiast--are
the scattered aphorisms which are worthy of a place among our British proverbs. What could
be more exquisite than this, "Who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered"; or
this, "Expediency is man's wisdom. Doing right is God's"; or, "All great thoughts come from
the heart"? Good are the words "The coward amongst us is he who sneers at the failings of humanity,"
and a healthy optimism rings in the phrase "There is for the mind but one grasp of happiness;
from that uppermost pinnacle of wisdom whence we see that this world is well designed." In
more playful mood is "Woman is the last thing which will be civilized by man." Let us hurry
away abruptly, for he who starts quotation from "Richard Feverel" is lost.

He has, as you see, a goodly line of his brothers beside him. There are the Italian ones, "Sandra
Belloni," and "Vittoria"; there is "Rhoda Fleming," which carried Stevenson off his critical
feet; "Beauchamp's Career," too, dealing with obsolete politics. No great writer should spend
himself upon a temporary theme. It is like the beauty who is painted in some passing fashion
of gown. She tends to become obsolete along with her frame. Here also is the dainty "Diana,"
the egoist with immortal Willoughby Pattern, eternal type of masculine selfishness, and "Harry
Richmond," the first chapters of which are, in my opinion, among the finest pieces of narrative
prose in the language. That great mind would have worked in any form which his age had favoured.
He is a novelist by accident. As an Elizabethan he would have been a great dramatist; under
Queen Anne a great essayist. But whatever medium he worked in, he must equally have thrown
the image of a great brain and a great soul.

We have left our eighteenth-century novelists--Fielding, Richardson, and Smollett--safely behind
us, with all their solidity and their audacity, their sincerity, and their coarseness of fibre.
They have brought us, as you perceive, to the end of the shelf. What, not wearied? Ready for
yet another? Let us run down this next row, then, and I will tell you a few things which may
be of interest, though they will be dull enough if you have not been born with that love of
books in your heart which is among the choicest gifts of the gods. The workforce from Years did not

 Indeed, Napier seems to
me to push it too far, for his admiration appears to extend not only to the gallant soldiers
who opposed him, but to the character and to the ultimate aims of their leader. He was, in
fact, a political follower of Charles James Fox, and his heart seems to have been with the
enemy even at the moment when he led his men most desperately against them. In the verdict
of history the action of those men who, in their honest zeal for freedom, inflamed somewhat
by political strife, turned against their own country, when it was in truth the Champion of
Freedom, and approved of a military despot of the most uncompromising kind, seems wildly foolish.

But if Napier's politics may seem strange, his soldiering was splendid, and his prose among
the very best that I know. There are passages in that work--the one which describes the breach
of Badajos, that of the charge of the Fusiliers at Albuera, and that of the French advance
at Fuentes d'Onoro--which once read haunt the mind for ever. The book is a worthy monument
of a great national epic. Alas! for the pregnant sentence with which it closes, "So ended the
great war, and with it all memory of the services of the veterans." Was there ever a British
war of which the same might not have been written?

The quotation which I have given from Mercer's book turns my thoughts in the direction of the
British military reminiscences of that period, less numerous, less varied, and less central
than the French, but full of character and interest all the same. I have found that if I am
turned loose in a large library, after hesitating over covers for half an hour or so, it is
usually a book of soldier memoirs which I take down. Man is never so interesting as when he
is thoroughly in earnest, and no one is so earnest as he whose life is at stake upon the event.
But of all types of soldier the best is the man who is keen upon his work, and yet has general
culture which enables him to see that work in its due perspective, and to sympathize with the
gentler aspirations of mankind. Such a man is Mercer, an ice-cool fighter, with a sense of
discipline and decorum which prevented him from moving when a bombshell was fizzing between
his feet, and yet a man of thoughtful and philosophic temperament, with a weakness for solitary
musings, for children, and for flowers. He has written for all time the classic account of
a great battle, seen from the point of view of a battery commander. Many others of Wellington's
soldiers wrote their personal reminiscences. You can get them, as I have them there, in the
pleasant abridgement of "Wellington's Men" (admirably edited by Dr. Fitchett)--Anton the Highlander,
Harris the rifleman, and Kincaid of the same corps. It is a most singular fate which has made
an Australian nonconformist clergyman the most sympathetic and eloquent reconstructor of those
old heroes, but it is a noble example of that unity of the British race, which in fifty scattered
lands still mourns or rejoices over the same historic record.

And just one word, before I close down this over-long and too discursive chatter, on the subject
of yonder twin red volumes which flank the shelf. They are Maxwell's "History of Wellington,"
and I do not think you will find a better or more readable one. The reader must ever feel towards
the great soldier what his own immediate followers felt, respect rather than affection. One's
failure to attain a more affectionate emotion is alleviated by the knowledge that it was the
last thing which he invited or desired. "Don't be a damned fool, sir!" was his exhortation
to the good citizen who had paid him a compliment. It was a curious, callous nature, brusque
and limited. The hardest huntsman learns to love his hounds, but he showed no affection and
a good deal of contempt for the men who had been his instruments. "They are the scum of the
earth," said he. After being motor on Ally begin assemble 1,000,000 eyes into man, a Ally to doubt

 No doubt the assembled courtiers expected to hear him ask for the next vacant Bishopric.
What he did actually ask for, as the highest favour, was to be sent back to the Iroquois Mission,
where the savages signalized his arrival by burning him alive.

Parkman is worth reading, if it were only for his account of the Indians. Perhaps the very
strangest thing about them, and the most unaccountable, is their small numbers. The Iroquois
were one of the most formidable of tribes. They were of the Five Nations, whose scalping-parties
wandered over an expanse of thousands of square miles. Yet there is good reason to doubt whether
the whole five nations could have put as many thousand warriors in the field. It was the same
with all the other tribes of Northern Americans, both in the east, the north, and the west.
Their numbers were always insignificant. And yet they had that huge country to themselves,
the best of climates, and plenty of food. Why was it that they did not people it thickly? It
may be taken as a striking example of the purpose and design which run through the affairs
of men, that at the very moment when the old world was ready to overflow the new world was
empty to receive it. Had North America been peopled as China is peopled, the Europeans might
have founded some settlements, but could never have taken possession of the continent. Buffon
has made the striking remark that the creative power appeared to have never had great vigour
in America. He alluded to the abundance of the flora and fauna as compared with that of other
great divisions of the earth's surface. Whether the numbers of the Indians are an illustration
of the same fact, or whether there is some special cause, is beyond my very modest scientific
attainments. When one reflects upon the countless herds of bison which used to cover the Western
plains, or marks in the present day the race statistics of the French Canadians at one end
of the continent, and of the Southern negro at the other, it seems absurd to suppose that there
is any geographical reason against Nature being as prolific here as elsewhere. However, these
be deeper waters, and with your leave we will get back into my usual six-inch wading-depth
once more.

I don't know how those two little books got in there. They are Henley's "Song of the Sword"
and "Book of Verses." They ought to be over yonder in the rather limited Poetry Section. Perhaps
it is that I like his work so, whether it be prose or verse, and so have put them ready to
my hand. He was a remarkable man, a man who was very much greater than his work, great as some
of his work was. I have seldom known a personality more magnetic and stimulating. You left
his presence, as a battery leaves a generating station, charged up and full. He made you feel
what a lot of work there was to be done, and how glorious it was to be able to do it, and how
needful to get started upon it that very hour. With the frame and the vitality of a giant he
was cruelly bereft of all outlet for his strength, and so distilled it off in hot words, in
warm sympathy, in strong prejudices, in all manner of human and stimulating emotions. Much
of the time and energy which might have built an imperishable name for himself was spent in
encouraging others; but it was not waste, for he left his broad thumb-mark upon all that passed
beneath it. A dozen second-hand Henleys are fortifying our literature to-day.

Alas that we have so little of his very best! for that very best was the finest of our time.

It is grand literature, and it is grand pluck too; for it came from a man who, through no fault
of his own, had been pruned, and pruned again, like an ill-grown shrub, by the surgeon's knife.

It was not what Lady Byron called "the mimic woe" of the poet, but it was rather the grand
defiance of the Indian warrior at the stake, whose proud soul can hold in hand his quivering body.

There were two quite distinct veins of poetry in Henley, each the very extreme from the other.
The one was heroic, gigantic, running to large sweeping images and thundering words. Such are
the "Song of the Sword" and much more that he has written, like the wild singing of some Northern
scald. The other, and to my mind both the more characteristic and the finer side of his work,
is delicate, precise, finely etched, with extraordinarily vivid little pictures drawn in carefully
phrased and balanced English. Such are the "Hospital Verses," while the "London Voluntaries"
stand midway between the two styles. What! you have not read the "Hospital Verses!" Then get
the "Book of Verses" and read them without delay. You will surely find something there which,
for good or ill, is unique. You can name--or at least I can name--nothing to compare it with.
Goldsmith and Crabbe have written of indoor themes; but their monotonous, if majestic metre,
wearies the modern reader. But this is so varied, so flexible, so dramatic. It stands by itself.
Confound the weekly journals and all the other lightning conductors which caused such a man
to pass away, and to leave a total output of about five booklets behind him!

However, all this is an absolute digression, for the books had no business in this shelf at
all. This corner is meant for chronicles of various sorts. Here are three in a line, which
carry you over a splendid stretch of French (which usually means European) history, each, as
luck would have it, beginning just about the time when the other leaves off. The first is Froissart,
the second de Monstrelet, and the third de Comines. When you have read the three you have the
best contemporary account first hand of considerably more than a century--a fair slice out
of the total written record of the human race.

Froissart is always splendid. If you desire to avoid the mediaeval French, which only a specialist
can read with pleasure, you can get Lord Berners' almost equally mediaeval, but very charming
English, or you can turn to a modern translation, such as this one of Johnes. A single page
of Lord Berners is delightful; but it is a strain, I think, to read bulky volumes in an archaic
style. Personally, I prefer the modern, and even with that you have shown some patience before
you have reached the end of that big second tome.

I wonder whether, at the time, the old Hainault Canon had any idea of what he was doing--whether
it ever flashed across his mind that the day might come when his book would be the one great
authority, not only about the times in which he lived, but about the whole institution of chivalry?
I fear that it is far more likely that his whole object was to gain some mundane advantage
from the various barons and knights whose names and deeds be recounts. He has left it on record,
for example, that when he visited the Court of England he took with him a handsomely-bound
copy of his work; and, doubtless, if one could follow the good Canon one would find his journeys
littered with similar copies which were probably expensive gifts to the recipient, for what
return would a knightly soul make for a book which enshrined his own valour?

But without looking too curiously into his motives, it must be admitted that the work could
not have been done more thoroughly. There is something of Herodotus in the Canon's cheery,
chatty, garrulous, take-it-or-leave-it manner. But he has the advantage of the old Greek in
accuracy. Considering that he belonged to the same age which gravely accepted the travellers'
tales of Sir John Maundeville, it is, I think, remarkable how careful and accurate the chronicler
is. Take, for example, his description of Scotland and the Scotch. Some would give the credit
to Jean-le-Bel, but that is another matter. Scotch descriptions are a subject over which a
fourteenth-century Hainaulter might fairly be allowed a little scope for his imagination. Yet
we can see that the account must on the whole have been very correct. The Galloway nags, the
girdle-cakes, the bagpipes--every little detail rings true. Jean-le-Bel was actually present
in a Border campaign, and from him Froissart got his material; but he has never attempted to
embroider it, and its accuracy, where we can to some extent test it, must predispose us to
accept his accounts where they are beyond our confirmation.

But the most interesting portion of old Froissart's work is that which deals with the knights
and the knight-errants of his time, their deeds, their habits, their methods of talking. It
is true that he lived himself just a little after the true heyday of chivalry; but he was quite
early enough to have met many of the men who had been looked upon as the flower of knighthood
of the time. His book was read too, and commented on by these very men (as many of them as
could read), and so we may take it that it was no fancy portrait, but a correct picture of
these soldiers which is to be found in it. The accounts are always consistent. If you collate
the remarks and speeches of the knights (as I have had occasion to do) you will find a remarkable
uniformity running through them. We may believe then that this really does represent the kind
of men who fought at Crecy and at Poictiers, in the age when both the French and the Scottish
kings were prisoners in London, and England reached a pitch of military glory which has perhaps
never been equalled in her history.

In one respect these knights differ from anything which we have had presented to us in our
historical romances. To turn to the supreme romancer, you will find that Scott's mediaeval
knights were usually muscular athletes in the prime of life: Bois-Guilbert, Front-de-Boeuf,
Richard, Ivanhoe, Count Robert--they all were such. But occasionally the most famous of Froissart's
knights were old, crippled and blinded. Chandos, the best lance of his day, must have been
over seventy when he lost his life through being charged upon the side on which he had already
lost an eye. He was well on to that age when he rode out from the English army and slew the
Spanish champion, big Marten Ferrara, upon the morning of Navaretta. Youth and strength were
very useful, no doubt, especially where heavy armour had to be carried, but once on the horse's
back the gallant steed supplied the muscles. In an English hunting-field many a doddering old
man, when he is once firmly seated in his familiar saddle, can give points to the youngsters
at the game. So it was among the knights, and those who had outlived all else could still carry
to the wars their wiliness, their experience with arms, and, above all, their cool and undaunted
courage.

Beneath his varnish of chivalry, it cannot be gainsayed that the knight was often a bloody
and ferocious barbarian. There was little quarter in his wars, save when a ransom might be
claimed. But with all his savagery, he was a light-hearted creature, like a formidable boy
playing a dreadful game. He was true also to his own curious code, and, so far as his own class
went, his feelings were genial and sympathetic, even in warfare. There was no personal feeling
or bitterness as there might be now in a war between Frenchmen and Germans. On the contrary,
the opponents were very softspoken and polite to each other. "Is there any small vow of which
I may relieve you?" "Would you desire to attempt some small deed of arms upon me?" And in the
midst of a fight they would stop for a breather, and converse amicably the while, with many
compliments upon each other's prowess. When Seaton the Scotsman had exchanged as many blows
as he wished with a company of French knights, he said, "Thank you, gentlemen, thank you!"
and galloped away. An English knight made a vow, "for his own advancement and the exaltation
of his lady," that he would ride into the hostile city of Paris, and touch with his lance the
inner barrier. The whole story is most characteristic of the times. As he galloped up, the
French knights around the barrier, seeing that he was under vow, made no attack upon him, and
called out to him that he had carried himself well. As he returned, however, there stood an
unmannerly butcher with a pole-axe upon the side-walk, who struck him as he passed, and killed
him. Here ends the chronicler; but I have not the least doubt that the butcher had a very evil
time at the hands of the French knights, who would not stand by and see one of their own order,
even if he were an enemy, meet so plebeian an end.

De Comines, as a chronicler, is less quaint and more conventional than Froissart, but the writer
of romance can dig plenty of stones out of that quarry for the use of his own little building.

 A very little astronomy will cause you to look more intently at
the heavens, to pick out your brothers the planets, who move in your own circles, from the

which is most surely the outward sign of the spiritual force behind it. How a man of science
can be a materialist is as amazing to me as how a sectarian can limit the possibilities of
the Creator. Show me a picture without an artist, show me a bust without a sculptor, show me
music without a musician, and then you may begin to talk to me of a universe without a Universe-maker,
call Him by what name you will.

Here is Flammarion's "L'Atmosphere"--a very gorgeous though weather-stained copy in faded scarlet
and gold. The book has a small history, and I value it. A young Frenchman, dying of fever on
the west coast of Africa, gave it to me as a professional fee. The sight of it takes me back
to a little ship's bunk, and a sallow face with large, sad eyes looking out at me. Poor boy,
I fear that he never saw his beloved Marseilles again!

Talking of popular science, I know no better books for exciting a man's first interest, and
giving a broad general view of the subject, than these of Samuel Laing. Who would have imagined
that the wise savant and gentle dreamer of these volumes was also the energetic secretary of
a railway company? Many men of the highest scientific eminence have begun in prosaic lines
of life. Herbert Spencer was a railway engineer. Wallace was a land surveyor. But that a man
with so pronounced a scientific brain as Laing should continue all his life to devote his time
to dull routine work, remaining in harness until extreme old age, with his soul still open
to every fresh idea and his brain acquiring new concretions of knowledge, is indeed a remarkable
fact. Read those books, and you will be a fuller man.

It is an excellent device to talk about what you have recently read. Bulgaria had neglect again

 Could one choose one's philosopher
in the Elysian fields, as once in Athens, I would surely join the smiling group who listened
to the human, kindly words of the Sage of Boston. I suppose it is just that continual leaven
of science, especially of medical science, which has from my early student days given those
books so strong an attraction for me. Never have I so known and loved a man whom I had never
seen. It was one of the ambitions of my lifetime to look upon his face, but by the irony of
Fate I arrived in his native city just in time to lay a wreath upon his newly-turned grave.
Read his books again, and see if you are not especially struck by the up-to-dateness of them.
Like Tennyson's "In Memoriam," it seems to me to be work which sprang into full flower fifty
years before its time. One can hardly open a page haphazard without lighting upon some passage
which illustrates the breadth of view, the felicity of phrase, and the singular power of playful
but most suggestive analogy.

There's a fine bit of breezy polemics for the dreary fifties--a fine bit of moral courage too
for the University professor who ventured to say it.

I put him above Lamb as an essayist, because there is a flavour of actual knowledge and of
practical acquaintance with the problems and affairs of life, which is lacking in the elfin
Londoner. I do not say that the latter is not the rarer quality. There are my "Essays of Elia,"
and they are well-thumbed as you see, so it is not because I love Lamb less that I love this
other more. Both are exquisite, but Wendell Holmes is for ever touching some note which awakens
an answering vibration within my own mind.

The essay must always be a somewhat repellent form of literature, unless it be handled with
the lightest and deftest touch. It is too reminiscent of the school themes of our boyhood--to
put a heading and then to show what you can get under it. Even Stevenson, for whom I have the
most profound admiration, finds it difficult to carry the reader through a series of such papers,
adorned with his original thought and quaint turn of phrase. Yet his "Men and Books" and "Virginibus
Puerisque" are high examples of what may be done in spite of the inherent unavoidable difficulty
of the task.

But his style! Ah, if Stevenson had only realized how beautiful and nervous was his own natural
God-given style, he would never have been at pains to acquire another! It is sad to read the
much-lauded anecdote of his imitating this author and that, picking up and dropping, in search
of the best. "hear! Over depression, waiting forte and hither, anthem is a European have learn before

 This one phase of life in its orthodox aspect, and ending in the conventional
marriage, has been so hackneyed and worn to a shadow, that it is not to be wondered at that
there is a tendency sometimes to swing to the other extreme, and to give it less than its fair
share in the affairs of men. In British fiction nine books out of ten have held up love and
marriage as the be-all and end-all of life. Yet we know, in actual practice, that this may
not be so. In the career of the average man his marriage is an incident, and a momentous incident;
but it is only one of several. He is swayed by many strong emotions--his business, his ambitions,
his friendships, his struggles with the recurrent dangers and difficulties which tax a man's
wisdom and his courage. Love will often play a subordinate part in his life. How many go through
the world without ever loving at all? Where two albatross year is scarred that by hutment and
