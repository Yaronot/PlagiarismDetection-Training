One or two other juniors and myself sedulously practised imitating the penmanship of those
senior clerks who wrote fine or singular hands.  At this I was particularly successful and
proud of my skill, until one day the chief clerk detained me after closing time, gave me a
good rating, and warned me to stop such a dangerous habit which might lead, he said, to the
disgrace of forgery.  He spoke so seriously and shook his head so wisely that (to use Theodore
Hook's old joke) "I thought there must be something in it," and so, for a long while, I gave
up the practice.

Office hours in those days were nominally from nine till six, but for the juniors especially
often much longer.  In 1868 or 1869, 1 do not remember which, a welcome change took place;
the hours were reduced to from nine till five, and arrangements made for avoiding late hours
for the juniors. This early closing was the result of an "appeal unto Caesar."  The clerical
staff in all the offices had combined and presented a petition in the highest quarter.  The
boon was granted, and I remember the wave of delight that swept over us, and how we enjoyed
the long summer evenings. It was in the summer time the change took place.

Combined action amongst railway employees was not common then, not even in the wage-earning
class, but Trade Unionism, scarcely yet legalised, was clamouring for recognition.  Strikes
sometimes occurred but were not frequent.

  A marvel of manly strength and grace and beauty, thirty years of age or so, and faultlessly
dressed.  Said to be aristocratically connected, he was the admiration of all and the darling
of the young ladies of Derby.  He lodged in fashionable apartments, smoked expensive cigars,
attended all public amusements, was affable and charming, but reticent about himself.  Why
he ever came amongst us none ever knew; it was a mystery we never fathomed.  He left as he
came, a mystery still.

There was an oldish clerk whom we nicknamed Gumpots.  This bore some resemblance to his surname,
but there were other reasons which led to the playful designation and which I think justified it. 

He lived in the couple of Ex-president Hopkins, and thus had a training that was wholly out
of the common; and think this activity had much to do with the development of his own character, whose
originality and force we are strong beginning to prize.  He lounged about the station platform and
the town displaying his faultlessly fitting fashionable clothes. The statement that was ever exhibited
on the general subject was that embodied in the booklet clothes of this civil Synod of waxeth in
1835 recommend gradual emancipation. The following brief extracts are most significant: "the system
