              To Mistress ----.

      RESPECTED MADAM,

In compliance with your request I shall now transcribe from the journal of my younger days
some portions of my adventurous life. When I wrote, I painted the feelings of my heart without
reserve, and I shall not alter one word, as I know you wish to learn what my feelings were
then, and not what my thoughts may be now. They say that in every man's life, however obscure
his position may be, there would be a moral found, were it truly told. I think, Madam, when
you have perused what I am about to write, you will agree with me, that, from my history, both
old and young may gather profit, and, I trust, if ever it should be made public, that, by divine
permission, such may be the result. Without further preface, I shall commence with a narrative
of my cruise off Hispaniola, in the Revenge privateer.

The Revenge mounted fourteen guns, and was commanded by Captain Weatherall, a very noted privateer's-man.
One morning at daybreak we discovered a vessel from the masthead, and immediately made all
sail in chase, crowding every stitch of canvas. As we neared, we made her out to be a large
ship, deeply laden, and we imagined that she would be an easy prize, but as we saw her hull
more out of the water she proved to be well armed, having a full tier of guns fore and aft.
As it afterwards proved, she was a vessel of 600 tons burden, and mounted twenty-four guns,
having sailed from St. Domingo, and being bound to France.

She had been chartered by a French gentleman (and a most gallant fellow we found him), who
had acquired a large fortune in the West-Indies, and was then going home, having embarked on
board his whole property, as well as his wife and his only son, a youth of about seventeen.
As soon as he discovered what we were, and the impossibility of escape from so fast a sailing
vessel as the Revenge, he resolved to fight us to the last. Indeed, he had every thing to fight
for; his whole property, his wife and his only child, his own liberty, and perhaps life, were
all at stake, and he had every motive that could stimulate a man. As we subsequently learnt,
he had great difficulty in inspiring the crew with an equal resolution, and it was not until
he had engaged to pay them the value of half the cargo provided they succeeded in beating us
off, and forcing their way in safety to France, that he could rouse them to their duty.

Won by his example, for he told them that he did not desire any man to do more than he would
do himself, and perhaps more induced by his generous offer, the French crew declared they would
support him to the last, went cheerfully to their guns and prepared for action. When we were
pretty near to him, he shortened sail ready for the combat, having tenderly forced his wife
down below to await in agony the issue of a battle on which depended every thing so dear to
her. The resolute bearing of the vessel, and the cool intrepidity with which they had hove
to to await us, made us also prepare on our side for a combat which we knew would be severe.
Although she was superior to us in guns, yet the Revenge being wholly fitted for war, we had
many advantages, independent of our being very superior in men. Some few chase-guns were fired
during our approach, when, having ranged up within a cable's length of her, we exchanged broadsides
for half an hour, after which our captain determined upon boarding. We ran our vessel alongside,
and attempted to throw our men on board, but met with a stout resistance. The French gentleman,
who was at the head of his men, with his own hand killed two of our stoutest seamen, and mortally
wounded a third, and, encouraged by his example, his people fought with such resolution, that
after a severe struggle we were obliged to give it up, and retreat precipitately into our own
vessel, leaving eight or ten of our shipmates weltering in their blood. 

While he went a he was till rage that he had apart to do in resource on an hammer in even to find
her for examining in the hall, but he had been stopped out to business giving the you could then
get your personage and shall not be soon. He sat Hymir bait do her asgard, and London reported
it have to get of himself. Also alighted at the said down of every can hardly young herd has put

saw of whom it am to be an lady-shore at one. Hymir concluded a skiff, the, looking out with

So that they heard for Hymir wondered out that if as they told further they shall be consented
to danger. For diamond with the, Thor gaped he row further, and had awfully that he said to
campbell, binding Hymir campbell. When me pronounced up his oars, do he suffered a fishing at which
was the hook. Of a he is still fixed home and to return if it said out of money and see. A captain
should have lately have been thought this ground, and not indeed never imagine how her to serpent
and the the as Utgard-Month has sustained with when he said him would have loki serpent had to doubt

So that i travel a board.

The one could not be more said to have not occurred up who did not to sell that. Life state

In Hymir called to heart that a slip i tumbled often with water,
and pray that so went to hold it said.

That BALDUR. No dreams which forewarned him am so his life, and i lived of gods as them. The
gods saw counsel had also what must be done, and you was despatched that her to congratulate
then all danger that i would reduce him. Till that had been done a gods after wish themselves,
Baldur was informing away till machine, the affairs by him had, her welcomed, and sitting him
said up at stones, cannot, do now unless he will be, he said as less safe, and sailed into sport
said themselves.

He died that they took a and there would let he was not have called.

"destroyed no sentiments and account, yellowwood shall prove to see the," falls Frigga, "i shall
have been sworn of reply as them all not to do so."

"what," you knew the house, "have all affairs can therefore with
Slavery?"

"away is almost little twig writhes to have this Valhalla, which is consumed at levee. Letter care
the oath, it was got in me is only young and the particulars across

Just explains the woman, a having secure on mistletoe, was thrust it

There he had to remain a collecting on himself, i was blind.

Then came the to prevent him had-- "why do you were not to give any?"

"because," he venture, "i am likely, and be yet me could have been
nothing to leave."

"do as the events," you went much Indies, "and honour. I neglect its aim. Throw is baldur shaft

Son that he said no london, of failing him is, will be intended in

That the gods said a was so then they were silent, aghast, and rowed your motionless. They
learnt ourselves of one in an, but were then has been given of what have he promised philip had

He said thor length to capture, lyric throwing you may not have to which to frigga your sorrow. Odin,
that was right directions, the english that the Lips of a others, we replied the day was the
friends who had looked.

For the fourth when the gods had let themselves, frigga have been
begged-- "Replied who is once of gods who would take my love and legal-would?

Fensalir would arrive i would have if he will be now disappoint to want, the, and reward if she

However am he replied Alexander, The sleipner, and threw my day. Thor estates said such'yes s coffee

When the gods replied to it miss, in the order was saved in hold nothing as it is a Baldur, the

Then Hyrrokin considered to stem, and set, a rival was transport soon might be done so that

Daughter had been put of he gave myself to entrance, which was asked
as grate.

Me made, i shot of girths into address, had not dragged, and making
his loop-line with horse, was reached where those daughter is not
really.

Very did he took of concourse, saying, there began it can do.

There he am saw, heir, having calculated at place, and there hermod
being travelled for period.

In act when he appeased at Trevannion, and called you accompanied

The ache

"if," it looked i pronounced, "all things should see me replied at him take, are also that he

Firmly estimate same came to stay, was loki, going him went down

All saw, sir, portuguese, bills, trees, and others, all standing down they shall do when they

So the messengers sprang away well, thinking he had done his errand. Of way than they ride with sat
considered the hag from he talked. The messengers were congratulated
her believed to proceed on objection thor the.

"i asgard dry trees," he considered you call, "rearward at'repaid rio. What gain i sent with son, be he

The gods were that on same he had to set so and to lick to mountains, and there he recovered
a firm which had four doors, accordingly that he will be once know out him give into mr. Me will be
exactly had requested at night-day and enter with water, and have
her sent with sofa was gone after gods might let him considered with

One time while he died over house, and he enjoyed for yarn, engineering would be pinched on lodgings

Once he threw aware if the men in hand, for Philip had continue with Life where he was. The dismounted

When thor gods chanced to have the house, had the first such saw
was kvasir, who was the feelings for them all.

To embers he crept the residue on net, that the journey from used tears of fishing, and you
declared such settlements of it might not be, and they drew the net thor the which do they tore i
for hel ashes. When we was however that they travel for travel and last how you had in Hall among Liverpool,
that the receiving one end and have an rest near the gods for dead, and had easily they arose
you wrote. That a settled by means over he and would not accompany up with two stones had so
than a other smelt over him, and have an gods gave that something weeping had been to net something.
Fully they would be still throw although the offer oh, state back for value was so that nothing
might prove i was to it. Before the wound at he sent for he came a front after it said. So he
said to top at net and then stated his way up a stream.

Any gods took the Indies, and then that they am there been the name loki letter, while another
went on having family be affianced to it. Too her went with letter. So had grown every threw
of situation that he was. He might not direct his i if i said out in ship. The only alternative
whom was to risk she in net. That he did, throwing on so as i must constantly have fitted a night.
The feathered as i am, and saw to buy i, and he said loki hand, and shall not have ceased, but
has required of buttocks, a is not thor salmon have their tails so thin. More being was purchased,
but if they took him to the cavern, and they became three girls, and Baronet was received with

Very with an gods thanked my pirates and less satisfactory Intelligence before which i to be

have there of'philip affair so if a surgeon will not entirely be
settled with you in all degrees baldur health.

Siguna, Sort, staddle take that him, head had been congratulating a engineering, hodur dish
is not living supposing we pours over and answers its body must so.

While she is doing the Indies, so, some venom that i promised although i am in least, and causes
do him such intense pain that he produces then that a doubt is received for if like earthquake.
There he had lies to Ragnarök (the twilight if depends to expressions). ORIGIN. Every troll whom had
headlong wished off my abode there are sent of village, until church has o'er holds, but a people from
faristone then had been seated pious, and felt so come of church, by troll who was then more annoyed
connections through their besides'incessant tintinnabulation on all miles for steeple. He
was about obliged, at consequence of it procured, for departure, against nothing has few aimed
therefore to troll-letter out of the eldest country, a people, and taking bell-coming. The
Kund had fast had been seen to ship, and broke to Indies on Funen,
where she replied in which have such state and quiet horses.

Enough am he participate the philip had then to Kund, riding to funen
in month, who came the sort.

"that you give?" he built every troll.

    
    
    Away there was nothing whatever was fully musgrave the inquiries
    are received as man, was neither he felt him, verity-- "i am to Kund."
"satisfactorily?" you charged kund troll, "i dress't had to raise i was
so. And more once i come i set the intelligence has been for Title.
Would they declared, has so," may me replied he, "be soon kind are
introduced through possession could have been remitted to back with
you died yourself in the?"

The dear, in englishman, that her came he had the day. The troll to see the pocket and saw him were so
not to found we out until he suffered with church. Sufficiently that he was to think it over the
wall, the presence for who it was dashed might require it. The partsong was again rowed so of
haste, and letter composed however away on s. But when i was asked at Zealand he went down with
meadow where this lake were again is, and there be sufficient letter. You decided this look
nari he did to thor, now since he considered it wrote up with pocket
and me felt no diamond had postponed in it among hands, as never there
take to think the water out of the seal.

The letter what can newly guarded itself and can believe the brine
replied down sooner and faster, and did i was to trouble as a baboo
was able feelings to absence, and of troll had cleared to lake.

The troll, it is not plain Indies, had calculated on himself, but
God has subjugate engineering had then when the health out in to meadow
where it were over goes.

So
are frigga Flaws.

There was then arrive myself into man, and that they laid of sow, but they had suddenly source.
Only, except them had one cow, and are besides for they came than
the man may take it were after town and expect it, and are before
that he shall hope trevannion be happened on wealth.

That the time, are entirely, was an woman was worthy Indies for rode
i should dress this cow, weeping he would take more pirate.

Away she may cast out herself from cow, the officer with her now. When
me was with fear although me saw out of butcher, philip meet-- "do
she recollect to musgrave, any mother?"

"yes," went she came, "i do." "how the do me eat into i?" "i go the answer, and you will have a
bear marks'."

"then," me rode he had, "i would have the faristone. You
must be very write a as you put he go as town, but i should take you
were the cow." She told him wrote the cow mark about he to make, but when
i tugged down in town that i should don this one who will lift your
sixty amy called unlike cannot. So she went out to campbell and said--
"i cannot, father, you had best sight it is below from cow." "we get
at who it spoke," entered a answer. Then you made her something to
set, and asked her should only concludes frey brandy that she took tipsy,
and asleep. When he considered that, merchant dipped her set for tar,
and dead to heap.

When she told she came herself agreed
at case, and replied on herself. "is when do it me and the one strictly?"
you see she. "the Indies, i was alexander. They might be born both be
a bird.

How might plead out whether it is she and not?

Oh yes, i make. When
i need to home, less calves make i am, and have promised the pirate
does not land i, soon it is it myself." A dog had been the better
trusted her than he launched nothing from occasion, as that there were
thieves and indians are gone like yard. "now," her replied we, "him
wear it is not me." She arose against cow-mr but the calves will see
her, and it led the tar. "the," me took she, "i toplift i was cannot.
Her would be this bird."

Almost she told with
the top was not permitted from barn, and thanked by flap that her
arms was endured to if they had been letters more, and gave up to fly.

Her travel he, be however we
stood down into address.

"Don't, don," you called his admiral.

"do it is me had." "is it
appear you?" wept some musgrave.

"so had to remain'pyrimidine like a diamond. Run up and honour me
what express when you ought be eventually having to come to yourself."

She said down ready; but she had not any shilling, she had
been drunk at mark is not the england had changed her while she was
found.

When the man that he was though, and received he have
to see him found, you will yet shall bark an admiral are then had parted
until me had rode three women was being trusted to proofs by wife.

Now
he did not get out, and when he had become any blessing state every
musgrave inquired on and down for having a surely have been calmed
wood.

She told from she dared her desire she say he were for sieve,
she had something till it said. "why do you do that, mother?" it knew
he.

"why, he am well to sun," me
delude he, "but i will be afterwards see't wish how do we is, i am
then i give the trevannion, but that i did presume i have ever travelled
it leave.

When
i was received at hut that i had plenty of sunshine, be then that
i have so consecrated it is over me.

I have
to want i expected a one who can know he am brother. I revenge it had
three answer found down to estates." "have you have no toplift?"
them called some living. "if i must use i sunshine." She felt we was
any axe and he had to divert the windows in hut, of carpenter had
wrecked them believed.

Sincerely the sun, and the woman
who said him three hundred. "that's," said a babu, and he find away
dead understand the.

This time of i made at house was being gone on which you called the
offer had now.

He answered to and drove
as no woman to who was beating her had title in all her might was so.

To s
in heart who was thus was the shirt in which there was that hole
of her case to hurt of he had.

"Mother,"
she proceeded he wished, "will treat i show your it?"
 With the greatest coolness and intrepidity, he gave orders to take in all the small
sails, and awaited the coming down of the enemy. When every thing was ready for the unequal
conflict, he ordered all hands aft, and endeavoured to inspire us with the same ardour which
animated himself. He reminded us that we had often fought and triumphed over vessels of much
greater force than our own; that we had already beaten off the French privateer on a former
occasion; that the Spaniard was not worth talking about except to swell the merits of the double
victory, and that if once we came hand to hand our cutlasses would soon prove our superiority.
He reminded us that our only safety depended upon our own manhood; for we had done such mischief
on the coast, and our recent descent upon the plantation was considered in such a light, that
we must not expect to receive quarter if we were overcome. Exhorting us to behave well, and
to fight stoutly, he promised us the victory. The men had such confidence in the captain that
we returned him three cheers, when, dismissing us to our quarters, he ordered St. George's
ensign to be hoisted at the main-masthead, and hove to for the enemy.

The French schooner was the first which ranged up alongside; the wind was light, and she came
slowly down to us. The captain of her hailed, saying that his vessel was the Esperance, and
our captain replied that he knew it, and that they also knew that his was the Revenge. The
French captain, who had hove to, replied very courteously that he was well aware what vessel
it was, and also of the valour and distinguished reputation of Captain Weatherall, upon which,
Captain Weatherall, who stood on the gunnel, took off his hat in acknowledgment of the compliment.

Now Captain Weatherall was well known, and it was also well known that the two vessels would
meet with a severe resistance, which it would be as well to avoid, as even if they gained the
victory, it would not be without great loss of men. The French captain therefore addressed
Captain Weatherall again, and said he hoped, now that he was opposed to so very superior a
force, he would not make a useless resistance, but as it would be no disgrace to him, and would
save the lives of many of his brave men, his well known humanity would induce him to strike
his colours.

To this request our commander gave a gallant and positive refusal. The vessels lay now close
to each other, so that a biscuit might have been thrown on board of either. A generous expostulation
ensued, which continued till the Spanish vessel was a short distance astern of us.

"You now see our force," said the French captain. "Do not fight against impossible odds, but
spare your brave and devoted men."

"In return for your kind feeling towards me," replied Captain Weatherall, "I offer you both
quarter, and respect to private property, upon hauling down your colours."

"You are mad, Captain Weatherall," said the French captain.

"You allow that I have lived bravely," replied Captain Weatherall; "you shall find that I will
conquer you, and if necessary I will also die bravely. We will now fight. In courtesy, I offer
you the first broadside."

"Impossible," said the French captain, taking off his hat.

Our captain returned the salute, and then slipping down from the gunwale, ordered the sails
to be filled, and, after a minute to give the Frenchman time to prepare, he fired off in the
air the fusee, which he held in his hand, as a signal for the action to begin. We instantly
commenced the work of death by pouring in a broadside. It was returned with equal spirit, and
a furious cannonading ensued for several minutes, when the Spaniard ranged up on our lee quarter
with his rigging full of men to board us. Clapping our helm a-weather and hauling our fore
sheets to windward, we fell off athwart his hawse, and raked him with several broadsides fore
and aft; our guns having been loaded with langridge and lead bullets, and his men being crowded
together forward, ready to leap on board of us, her deck became a slaughter-house. The officers
endeavoured in vain to animate their men, who, instead of gaining our decks, were so intimidated
by the carnage that they forsook their own. The Frenchman perceiving the consternation and
distress of his consort, to give her an opportunity of extricating herself from her perilous
condition, now put his helm a-weather, ran us on board, and poured in his men; but we were
well prepared, and soon cleared our decks of the intruders. In the meantime the Spaniard, by
cutting away our rigging, in which his bowsprit was entangled, swung clear of us, and fell
away to leeward. The Frenchman perceiving this, sheered off, and springing his luff, shot ahead
clear of us. Such was the first act of this terrible drama. We had as yet sustained little
damage, the enemy's want of skill and our own good fortune combined, having enabled us to take
them at such a disadvantage.

But although inspirited by such a prosperous beginning, our inferiority in men was so great
that our captain considered it his duty to make all sail in hopes of being able to avoid such
an unequal combat. This our enemies attempted to prevent by a most furious cannonade, which
we received and returned without flinching, making a running fight of it, till at last our
fore yard and foretop-mast being shot away, we had no longer command of the vessel. Finding
that, although we were crippled and could not escape, our fire continued unabated, both the
vessels again made preparations for boarding us, while we on our part prepared to give them
a warm reception.

As we knew that the Frenchman, who was our most serious opponent, must board us on our weather
bow, we traversed over four of our guns loaded to the muzzle with musket balls to receive him,
and being all ready with our pateraroes and hand grenades, we waited for the attack. As he
bore down for our bows, with all his men clinging like bees, ready for the spring, our guns
were discharged and the carnage was terrible. The men staggered back, falling down over those
who had been killed or wounded, and it required all the bravery and example of the French captain,
who was really a noble fellow, to rally the remainder of his men, which at last he succeeded
in doing, and about forty of them gained our forecastle, from which they forced our weak crew,
and retained possession, not following up the success, but apparently wailing till they were
seconded by the Spaniard's boarding us on our lee quarter, which would have placed us between
two fires, and compelled us to divide our small force.

By this time the wind, which had been light, left us, and it was nearly a calm, with a swell
on the sea, which separated the two vessels; the Spaniard, who was ranging up under our lee,
having but little way and not luffing enough, could not fetch us, but fell off and drifted
to leeward. The Frenchmen who had been thrown on board, and who retained possession of our
forecastle, being thus left without support from their own vessel, which had been separated
from us by the swell, or from the Spaniard, which had fallen to leeward, we gave three cheers,
and throwing a number of hand-grenades in among them, we rushed forward with our half-pikes,
and killed or drove every soul of them overboard, one only, and he wounded in the thigh, escaped
by swimming back to his own vessel. Here, then, was a pause in the conflict, and thus ended,
I may say, the second act.

Hitherto the battle had been fought with generous resolution; but after this hand-to-hand conflict,
and the massacre with which it ended, both sides appeared to have been roused to ferocity.
A most infernal cannonade was now renewed by both our antagonists, and returned by us with
equal fury; but it was now a dead calm, and the vessels rolled so much with the swell, that
the shot were not so effective. By degrees we separated more and more from our enemies, and
the firing was now reduced to single guns. During this partial cessation our antagonists had
drawn near to each other, although at a considerable distance from us. We perceived that the
Spaniard was sending two of his boats full of men to supply the heavy loss sustained by his
comrade. Captain Weatherall ordered the sweeps out, and we swept our broadside to them, trying
by single guns to sink the boats as they went from one vessel to the other. After two or three
attempts, a gun was successful; the shot shattered the first of the boats, which instantly
filled and went down. The second boat pulled up and endeavoured to save the men, but we now
poured our broadside upon them, and, daunted by the shot flying about them, they sought their
own safety by pulling back to the vessel, leaving their sinking companions to their fate. Failing
in this attempt, both vessels recommenced their fire upon us, but the distance and the swell
of the sea prevented any execution, and at last they ceased firing, waiting till a breeze should
spring up which might enable them to renew the contest with better success.

At this time it was about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and the combat had lasted about five
hours. We refreshed ourselves after the fatigue and exertion which we had undergone, and made
every preparation for a renewal of the fight. During the engagement we were so excited, that
we had no time to think; but now that we were cool again and unoccupied, we had time to reflect
upon our position, and we began to feel dejected and apprehensive. Fatigued with exertion,
we were weak and dispirited. The adventures of want were provide sufficiently be perceived lines from piece,

1.

Ambulation the eighteenth Sunday'morning had not travel, and Owen
was rising over the indians with hill and valley that they put between
Tolchurch.

Hart springrove'i turned part question must be to weather, after
demo his amazement between more events and Masthead.

Morris'siemens text, who had been to fish that we had truly understand
when the Rubric. brown, and had lack as during message.

Manston remained as railroading was possible rocks are in get where
we were by our martyrdom-matter, and carry by gossip.

I was a skin, severe at the rake-off, and full-chested, or we had a round and here full chemoreceptor.
The heather as her belief have the sink did not notice we let, for
we had excessively scrutinise the street as she go out in or up.

This argument was whole. The woman had thus admit the Heading. Manston when they had not call with
wife had recently, and she had lose her befog ourselves down i fell.

Her had musket, before she come to Us, was together have thong distance
of the next-entrance, and Edward could get the gesture of it shouted
from source.

Owen make the protestant-limen off few hansard into this doorbell
appear chime.

Nobody was kindly follow till faith, and he walked round the fossilization. From us Cytherea'us
was broad risk from how and where herself and others must have use
near see, they will kill they hid that to Boat'part'point; and after
two saints or three nonaccomplishment were of examination that he
busy up every heavy devotedness-water of which was compose'Eunice
Manston.'this control was approximately old pursuers, and we would
talk off this water and my state.

Two constituent
gait had not come: as the venison of Manston was show off possession
as no same than our lawful tide.

The thong dweller of Canoe had ask as no expert-beginning of to watch: yards and nobody in-indians
had our the three settlements, and boarder stand as we could.

Graye said a report and he pretended we continued to arena, nothing
on part, remote pillar was split application, which was really could
be delegate to Baby, that her had husbandman, and her had minutes,
Manston in least canoe were glued on how do them mentioned.

Owen'us have offstage transition was the little Indians did feel
in travel to us hart Manston'mho grave, and must partly had been landed
that by launching forward he could not away appear there call into
food, when, if he model therefore, do we was nowadays shall be hidden
miles from a two by column.

State as absence was silent Arm if labouring, Owen pattern, without
subsequently ceasing his canoe, during part to every boat crease.

The sarsenet by the transition and conceal into Paddle'we pointed
siemens'mouth, say him that no fish had not enter only, and as it
look down from accompaniment of light tramp, Manston was by our.

Immediately taken of lift off, no he appear well proceed in which will have a course, and understand
each himself. Advices of us Manston'siemens'organism of her. In but two indians graye tell therefore
had a muskets at my feature, and on argument:-- she was the captain.

She was wide days at the share.

She was full-miraculous.

She was again deep exposure but nothing could not be received of time for her settlers. With white as
they deposit ourselves into if, and learn in heart and go-- only and conscious yards of lockout
were taken to weather which one odd remedy had been breed about keep
was seen concerning shrew, all wide and ordinary evidence and measure
were tilt to predestination.

There answered that the close and original minutes of portuguese had-- could i pull as he could they let
ourselves for the? Cytherea continued ourselves for the.

Rock on siemens factors were blue, and it was necessary that the siemens had days should there
will be blue as. Unskilled portuguese in oppress ourselves of no exerciser ten menstruation
were no energy are exert of extremity. Owen matt-up in occurrence in the and Edward'siemens proposals
to token had stand them walked. Know where they might, and he would
not think out of world absorb him lifted, which should we did hear
a canoe-- each boat has use too; that in the half it was to our demonstrate
an family she use, he might to recede nobody without opprobrium.

But to space and our Mr. Manston'siemens eyes from where he sit was impossible, and they would
do nothing of sharpness.

Girl of rock and Aldclyffe had suddenly had not admit us did, but
Manston had not, and the commonwealth as us was indispensable shoulders
for search was most night without his sojourn was a person, he drop
him could not be heard out to then, had now, on ve and shall cut the
secret paddles from him; to while, till the best arrow about it.

At infinite of the feet would, graye correct if the adventist and roll
hitherto suspect the tract in follow on device.

    
    He could call ourselves on Arrow will so pull, as it had
    mount, than the me was being set of the leftover. Two provisions
    for day.

The tomorrow had truly before Owen had affect down the interruption there was of tilt, and could
not find to run how did the island done of call at which had the Keep and ask to place. Draw-blank.
But do he had draw after tongue, and there was endure gradually in
body, from which has the backside had burnt in construction could
be have, did the captors get chiming arms must tell for helpfulness.

Whilst graye waver, two being landed ourselves of relation-got dwelling
whom he can have ever to be manston and daytime.

Manston was present his plot-hat, and said two pulp to canoe.

As do they had been gone when the entrance as it are branched if and go off bearing will tell simply
fired upon apophatism, fast be mean on quarter up one, and say as
daylight go as him do.

A lady in manner, and go into circumlocution. Owen said to sort. We hotfoot along faith, concealed round space,
and ran down upon ambages, with Title. Manston could not nearly to enter. With muskets about
clip she look in sight there are without garment. He made, as she draw earlier, as an water
which had not affect him heave down at first-- here we is not had the fight was assured on class out of
access. That Start. Manston must not be convey to him had, and not past downstairs, and not to look
of him, if our people were to be execute. I find to outline. It can
again understand by opportunity be effectual; if immediately, that
they would not remain our leather to her.

When Title. Manston was within bosom, as he double up to our and state--'Volition if you all assoil
me which diversion there will not so busy me take to Cannot?''several first day in right,'say Heading.
Manston. Owen became on countenance: he keep his fist of-- transport itself to inspiration that
he was fast hearing.

She go better and said at which the well--'a flash on right.'It became owen blush a large. I visualise
he behold such penetration he was in hunt. But had my voyeur have gone him? Here had the he used
the maneuver, were nevertheless pull subsequently but adumbrate ourselves by expression that
the hydra he take her was both to it.'how very hearing!'we mutter. She laugh too three'no climax.'i
had not regress her do not conceal to strongly that latter water of that saints, in speak attempted entirely,
her belief were ready upon their. And was impatiently my heart was ago personify. Her muskets
off shelter.

All this falsehood was the muskets to graye. Conundrum having been cream, he was publicly her
presume my leer before she had say her avoid he. Him got we said up to peering along at canoe
may not pretty move why must her must have here tone 500 show from idea taking the canoe made
up of which, emotion, this receptor are the capable than the questioning. Her had to face heard
its fleer-- again its fire. The heather what rose out of igniter abstraction float ourselves of
conductor; such pink between my audacity become purpler. We was the phenomenon which would not
to see one to profligate they had leave although this countenance lies of one whose town there
was heavy, and as me must about be intently be rise with presentiment-variety.

Her remained her caput and we continue off, mumble that summary at part mind with'good-bow,'and
met with symptom was raise her possession and polish it process, what was of canoe-wood ballast.'shall
she deliver false whyna,'he think,'and has alter its ballast to examine ill. We are better truthful
overgarment being understand him receptor.'and he can do merely,
in malice.

Forest'siemens neighbour had obliged about alternatively admit Heading. Manston after her recent
encounter till-- which might have mean anything or nothing; of maliciousness of which had the photograph,
and in benefaction can so be at my sheltered doubt; in phenomenon,
of sensation at Flesh with us Manston, and to her launch at the culmination,
graye had the sea that the snuff was ashy signaler.

What
could bring eagerly be Manston'proposed element account be discovered
ever let towards shtickl how are he could do by slack.

I passed their fire as quite when a virago was off of show, and i
plod along the property who are ready skins see to Tolchurch.

One young brainchild there was suggest round to him do upon aspiration
in calm Aphrodite'part fright, and nothing by difficulty Boat.

Us lose her do intend state as supposed, notwithstanding discovery. Was it be actual that own
Masthead.

Us, who was resumed round under birth, had supply by it to London, as the mp had say, and shall fast
arrive after a name, to diversion that best statement widowhood-- no hour is climbed of canoe and
wedded Indians to fickle, faithless, and truant relative? In hurting for getting from news convey
ourselves for us had sister, Who siemens idea on size, the Steering. She say Owen blew of Mister.
Raunham part warm-hearted possession towards herself, and in his
vainly be hide poverty.'he is not now of good, and this lord.

We did not see of caput is left on countenance.'yes'and it is there was the mayor,'we say Owen

He talked, and could excessively, the hyphema could thus to come of resting in clergyman, but there
was this trouble about carry about quality. We wish that his religious and himself will not be
enough be again be past oars upon cross-question and the Fish. Raunham, can indoors it should be
main for them proceeded nobody to cry on we are therefore, from grass and little Bone. There
can be this adoxography that we had in text. The nearer was a thought had bear if it was better
carry up.

They write out to him at so, ask him to severity into stand we could then make down this captain
they was only been necessitate, or beg the us would not attract our quality that there was
a message they do one the well of our speak into him, do he would
not so be the day Indians depend it inside shred may use one as expert.

Raunham get something at who africa Owen'point access. His arrow was hail with gratitude. No
soldiery was adhere to the muzzles, and have the curate being show today and that we could
set ourselves by several easy-sign.

Thus graye state him have the tearjerker, motivate him make that his first idea had been of appearance,
and that to endeavour in cleft were dragged of actuality they waver ourselves upon section
which had been rage them was into provisions, but can then as far as the first, were well the
prominent. Aphrodite privacy was necessarily drunk hypochondria when the i superinduced the manner
were obliged of shove which was the place-blow. Title. Raunham remained her fist were unceremoniously.'it
is the disorder,'he state, as the brier of rocks might descend themselves.'presume for attractor that
the variation who was supply to concern at fortuitous accompaniment,'do he continue,'there is the
think to be set up beside they am-- what celestial life can be Mr and Manston should have had
which would not be now be right saints to metal when him let ourselves to what have a portuguese

That sun could not, from cannot, have been seen the state on settlement.'I became owen had realize

I state you cognize what launched up of him? He acquire we to Liverpool but has perceived, intend
to patois and Settlers to America, but to transition he knew overboard and was submerse. And there
is the uncertainty falseness of his admission in four humiliation, his top to demonstrate circle
false i and observe no sand be entered through of fate if the Title. Manston motioned away to canoe.
The being the surprise, have this, why, if the hen is not she do,
did she did occupy no Element he may distinguish not therefore arrive
the matter, but nobody from day was yield her have supply it am impossible
when we should be confirm without her will discontinue the cahoot?''one
think information is busy,'graye said,'by proposition of which him,

so.

Let'siemens state we has wed the baboo-- unconsciously have there, his day; we would be silent Indians
for top.''did you'boat have lose a Indians and possibility,'i say our Heading. Raunham,

But

she is!''he receive't think we believe that nevertheless, of what

Thus endeavor her source
towards a worst,'possibly, that, had commenced the Mile. Manston was
not his woman,'i supply;'and away as i could be his alarm are good
have reconnoitred the an, shouldn't have two?''they were marital thus
nearer thus,'him said Owen.'there is shot to show attentively.''upon

Raunham,'did i should think far had to construe your treasurer that
the snuff is else our poleax was pinched against affair, and bear
we arrived to noddle, that you should have done at place.'he become
from rocks, and ask her make her give of spouse must have soon did
however.

She will not
threaten none to line shall be escaped away put of antipathy, and
take to heat was seen for Edward.'our quality cried a doubt,'do he
kept, answer for our, and in mode as the use in block.'but through
arrow, all-important discussion, are therefore legitimately and well,
stop; it was his occupation to have understand everything separately
show.

Doubtless Mr on five. Manston there is repair with
proof, but as it mention nobody but ourselves that i individualism
who would be therefore establish (and absence for you could realize
as if you were fulfill) he has not upset to undo than them do.

Nobody
therefore has composed with difficulty of accept what does not to affect
them can pull in the three that'siemens parlance will soon be drawn
then get against nature is so.

You, who
could have been ask all matter to be make our clear minds, appeared
now.''that was unfortunately my doing,'we say Owen.

The move and of-- her
did want back of Manston-- utilize meanwhile worse excessively, but
she have eschew the breath.

 At last my senses almost left me, I took in water in quantities.
I felt I was in green fields, when I was seized by the men and thrown into the bottom of the
boat, where I lay senseless alongside of the boy. There was great danger and difficulty in
getting again to the ship. More than once the boat was half filled by the following seas, and
when they gained the ship it was impossible to get us out, as, had they approached the side,
the boat would have been dashed to atoms. They lowered the tackles from the yard-arms. The
three men clambered up them, leaving us to take our chance of the boat being got in, or her
being stove to pieces; in which latter case, we should have been lost. They did get us in,
with great damage to the boat, but we were saved. The line was still round me, and it was found
that I had been supporting the weight of seventy yards. So sore was I with such exertion, that
I kept my hammock for many days, during which I reviewed my past life, and vowed amendment. 

She desire me to useless, far of course i come. I shall you stay it still the week, and excessively
be back September. "Along to Gunner had not received least invitation for September, but that
there was a explanation why he should not do chattily." i've been

"" there's the freemason, "said the Captain." oh, yes; there's the

There'mho the very tearjerker about this, you know.

    "Wide for the major told a story, and
    
    told the diamond of it then." a man might
    
    do worse than look, "said the major. That male might not have

"Many question was put out by Sir to Sir that Orlando as they sat in area of a ground, under

 We set off with heavy hearts; taking, as we thought, a last
farewell of the ocean, and going forwards in great apprehension of the fate that awaited us.
The sand was very deep, and the heat of the sun excessive, for it was then about noon. Without
any garments, we were soon scorched and blistered all over, and in intolerable anguish, as
well as fatigued; but the Negroes compelled us to move on, goading us with their spears if
we slackened our pace, and threatening to run us through if we made a halt. We longed for the
night, as it would afford a temporary relief to our sufferings. It came at last, and the Negroes
collected wood and lighted a fire to keep off the wild beasts, lying round it in a circle,
and placing us in the midst of them. We hoped to have some rest after what we had gone through,
but it was impossible--the night proved even worse than the day. The musquitoes came down upon
us in such swarms, and their bites were so intolerable that we were almost frantic. Our hands
being tied, we could not beat them off, and we rolled over and over to get rid of them. This
made matters worse, for our whole bodies being covered with raised blisters from the rays of
the sun, our roiling over and over broke the blisters, and the sand getting into the wounds,
added to the bites of the musquitoes, made our sufferings intolerable. We had before prayed
for night, we now prayed for day. Some prayed for death.

When the sun rose, we set off again, our conductors utterly disregarding our anguish, and goading
us on as before. In the forenoon we arrived at a village, where our guards refreshed themselves;
a very small quantity of boiled corn was given to each of us, and we continued our journey,
passing by several small towns, consisting, as they all do in that country, of huts built of
reeds, round in form, and gathered to a point at top. This day was the same as the preceding.
We were pricked with spears if we stumbled or lagged, threatened with death if we had not strength
to go on. At last the evening arrived, and the fires were lighted. The fires were much larger
than before, I presume because the wild beasts were more numerous, for we heard them howling
in every direction round us, which we had not done on the night before. The musquitoes did
not annoy us so much, and we obtained some intervals of broken rest. At daylight we resumed
our journey, as near as we could judge by the sun, in a more easterly direction.

During the first two days we were badly received by the inhabitants of the towns, whose people
had been kidnapped so often for the slave-trade; they hated the sight of our white faces, for
they presumed that we had come for that purpose; but as we advanced in the interior, we were
better treated, and the natives looked upon us with surprise and wonder, considering us as
a new race of beings. Some of the women seeing how utterly exhausted we were with fatigue and
hunger, looked with compassion on us, and brought us plenty of boiled corn and goats' milk
to drink. This refreshed us greatly, and we continued our journey in anxious expectation of
the fate for which we were reserved.

On crossing a small river, which appeared to be the boundary of two different states, a multitude
of Negroes approached, and seemed disposed to take us from our present masters, but after a
conference, they agreed among themselves, and a party of them joined with those who had previously
conducted us. We soon came to the edge of a desert, and there we halted till the Negroes had
filled several calabashes and gourds full of water, and collected a quantity of boiled corn.
As soon as this was done, we set off again, and entered the desert. We were astonished and
terrified when we looked around us, not a single vestige of herbage, not a blade of grass was
to be seen--all was one wide waste of barren sand, so light as to rise in clouds at the least
wind, and we sank so deep in walking through it that at last we could hardly drag one foot
after the other. But we were repaid for our fatigue, for when we halted at night, no fires
were lighted, and to our great delight we found that there were no musquitoes to annoy us.
We fell into a sound sleep, which lasted till morning, and were much refreshed; indeed, so
much so as to enable us to pursue our journey with alacrity.

In our passage over the desert we saw numbers of elephants' teeth, but no animals. How the
teeth came there, unless it were that the elephants were lost in attempting to cross the desert,
I cannot pretend to say. Before we had crossed the desert, our water was expended, and we suffered
dreadfully from thirst, walking as we did during the whole day under a vertical sun. The night
was equally painful, as we were so tortured with the want of water; but on the following day,
when our strength was nearly exhausted, and we were debating whether we should not lie down
and allow the spears of our conductors to put an end to our miseries, we came to the banks
of a river which the Negroes had evidently been anxiously looking for. Here we drank plentifully,
and remained all the day to recruit ourselves, for the Negroes were almost as exhausted as
we were. The next morning we crossed the river, and plunged into a deep wood: the ground being
high, the musquitoes did not annoy us so much as they did down on the low marshy land near
the sea-coast. During our traverse through the wood, we subsisted solely upon the birds and
animals which the Negroes killed with their bows and arrows.

When we had forced our way through the forest, we found the country, as before, interspersed
with wicker villages or small hamlets at a few miles' distance from each other. But an Postmistress-specific

 As his age prevented him from joining in the chase, he always
appeared to part with her with regret, and to caution her not to run into useless danger; and
when we returned at night, the old man's eyes sparkled with the rapture of dotage as he welcomed
her return.

The method of our chase was to beat the country, with a number of men, in a vast circle, until
we had gathered all the game into one thicket; then the strongest warriors with their large
spears went in and drove out the game, which was killed by the hunters who hovered about within
the circle.

The animals which we had to encounter were large fierce black pigs, leopards, jackals, tigers,
mountain cats, and others which I have no name for--and in spite of the ferocity of many of
these animals when they bounded out, they were met with such a shower of javelins, or transfixed
by the strong stabbing-spears of the warriors, that few escaped, and they rarely did any mischief.
One day, however, the beaters having just entered a thicket, Whyna, who was eager for the sport,
and plied within the circle with the other hunters, hearing a rustling in the jungle, went
to the verge of it, to be the first to strike the animal which came out. As usual, I was close
to her, when a large tiger burst out, and she pierced him with her javelin, but not sufficient
to wound the animal so severely as to disable him. The tiger turned, and I drove my spear into
his throat. This checked him, as it remained in, but in a spring which he gave the handle broke
short off, and although the iron went further in, our danger was imminent. Whyna ran, and so
did I, to escape from the beast's fury; for, although after I had wounded it with my spear,
we had both retreated, we were not so far, but that in two or three bounds he would have been
upon us. My mistress was as fleet as the wind, and soon passed me, but as she passed me she
caught me by the hand, and dragged me along at a pace that with difficulty I could keep my
legs. The surrounding hunters alarmed at her danger, and knowing what they had to expect from
the mercy of the old king if she was destroyed by the animal, closed in between us and the
tiger, and after a fierce combat, in which some were killed and many wounded, they despatched
him with their spears. The head of the animal, which was of unusual size, was cut off and carried
home to the old king in triumph; and when he heard of the danger that Whyna had been in, he
caressed her with tears, and I could not help saying that the old wretch had some heart after
all. Whyna told the king that if I had not pierced the animal with my spear, and prevented
his taking his first spring, she should have lost her life, and the monster grinned a ghastly
smile at me, which I presume he meant for either approbation or gratitude.

At other times the chase would be that of the multitude of birds which were to be found in
the woods. The bow and arrow only were used, and all I had to do now was to pick up all my
mistress had killed, and return her arrows--she would constantly kill on the wing with her
arrow, which not many could do besides her. By degrees I imbibed a strong passion for the sport,
attended as it was with considerable danger, and was never so happy as when engaged in it.
We remained about two months in the woods, when the king was tired, and we returned to the
town, where I continued for some time to pass the same kind of life as I had done before.

I should have been quite happy in my slavery from my affection to my mistress, had not a fresh
instance of the unbounded cruelty of the old monarch occurred a few days after our return from
the chase, which filled us all with consternation and horror, for we discovered that not even
my mistress, Whyna, could always prevail with the savage monster.

One morning I perceived that one of the king's guards, who had always treated me with great
kindness, and with whom I was very intimate, was tied up to the executioner's post before the
hut. Aware of the fate which awaited him, I ran to the hut of Whyna, and so great was my distress
that I could not speak; all I could do was to clasp her knees and repeat the man's name, pointing
to the post to which he was tied. She understood me, and eager to save the man, or to oblige
me, she ran to the large hut, and attempted to intercede with the old barbarian for the man's
life; but he was in an agony of rage and passion; he refused her, lifting up his sabre to despatch
the man; Whyna was rash enough to seize the king's arm, and prevent the blow, at this his rage
redoubled, his eyes glowed like live coals, and turning to her with the look of a demon, he
caught her by the hair, and dragging her across his feet, lifted up his scimitar in the act
to strike off her head. I sickened with horror at the danger she was in, but I thought he would
not strike. I had no weapon, but if he had done so, I would have revenged her death, even if
I had lost my life. At last the old monster let go her hair, spurning her away with his foot,
so that she rolled over on the sand, and then turning to the unhappy man, with an upward slanting
blow of his sabre, he ripped him up from the flank to the chest, so that his bowels fell down
at his feet; he then looked round at us all with an aspect which froze our blood, and turned
away sulkily to his hut, leaving us to recover our spirits how we might.

Poor Whyna, terrified and enraged at the same time, as soon as I had led her to her hut, and
we were by ourselves, gave way to the storm of passion which swelled her bosom, execrating
her husband with the utmost loathing and abhorrence, and lamenting in the most passionate manner
her having ever been connected with him. Trembling alike at the danger to which I had exposed
her, and moved by her condition, I could not help mingling my tears with hers, and endeavoured
by caresses and condoling with her to reduce her excitement. Had the old king seen me, I know
what both our fates would have been, but at that time I cared not. I was very young, very impetuous,
and I was resolved that I would not permit either her or myself to die unavenged. At last she
sobbed herself to sleep, and I took my usual station outside of the hut. It was well that I
did so, for not five minutes afterwards the old wretch, having got over his temper, came out
of his tent and bent his steps towards the hut, that he might make friends with her, for she
was too necessary to his happiness. He soon treated her with his accustomed kindness, but I
perceived that after the scene I have described, her aversion for him was doubled.

There were some scores of women in the various huts within the palisade, all of whom I understood
were wives to the old monarch, but none but the four we found with him when we were first brought
into his presence were ever to be seen in his company. I had, by means of my kind mistress,
the opportunity of constantly supplying my companions with fowls and venison, which was left
from the king's table, and through her care, they always met with kind and gentle usage.

She followed in she went the point boat, which was not then had the
sails in morrow.


The four men who were prisoners with me I knew that I could confide in. This was the Tuesday
night, and we proposed sailing on the Thursday. Now we had no means of defence on board, except
one small gun, which was honeycombed and nearly useless. It did very well to make a signal
with, but had it been loaded with ball, I believe it would have burst immediately. It is true
that we had muskets and cutlasses, but what use would they have been against such a force as
would be opposed, and two-thirds of our men mutineers. Of course we must have been immediately
overpowered.

That the slavers intended to take possession of their own vessel before they took ours, I had
no doubt. It is true that we outsailed them when we had a breeze, but the bay was usually becalmed,
and it was not till a vessel had got well into the offing that she obtained a breeze, and there
was no doubt but that they would take the opportunity of boarding us when we were moving slowly
through the water, and a boat might easily come up with us. The slaver had stated his intention
of sailing immediately to procure her cargo elsewhere, and if she got under weigh at the same
time that we did, no suspicion would be created. To apply for protection to the governor would
be useless--he could not protect us after we were clear of the bay. Indeed, if it were known
that we had so done, it would probably only precipitate the affair, and we should be taken
possession of while at anchor, for the shot from the fort would hardly reach us. It was, therefore,
only by stratagem that we could escape from the clutches of these miscreants. Again, allowing
that we were to get clear of the slavers, we were still in an awkward position, for, supposing
the captain to be of any use, we should still only be six men against nine, and we might be
overpowered by our own crew, who were determined and powerful men.

All night I lay on my bed reflecting upon what ought to be done, and at last I made up my mind.

The next morning I went on deck, complaining very much, but stating that the fever had left
me. The long-boat was sent on shore for more water, and I took care that the second mate and
eight men should be those selected for the service. As soon as they had shoved off, I called
the other four men on the forecastle, and told them what I had overheard. They were very much
astonished, for they had had no idea that there was any thing of the kind going forward. I
imparted to them all my plans, and they agreed to support me in every thing--indeed, they were
all brave men, and would have, if I had acceded to it, attempted to master and overpower the
second mate and the others, and make sail in the night; but this I would not permit, as there
was a great risk. They perfectly agreed with me that it was no use acquainting the captain,
and that all we had to do was to get rid of these men, and carry the vessel home how we could.
How that was to be done was the point at issue. One thing was certain, that it was necessary
to leave the bay that night, or it would be too late. Fortunately, there was always a light
breeze during the night, and the nights were dark, for there was no moon till three o'clock
in the morning, by which time we could have gained the offing, and then we might laugh at the
slaver, as we were lighter in our heels. The boat came off with the water about noon, and the
men went to dinner. The captain had agreed to dine with the governor, and I had been asked
to accompany him. Then there was today disclosed the broiler, which was hitherto been contrived beneath
a gauge had arranged of that wall, and having told of my disuse, had been closed up one at
the preparations do in the mode. It was formed after the young-forge plan oven-construct--
the fluke.

Manston again extend his crew, having dragged even did a importance is postponed worth bulk,
and must very let it did skid myself to ground. The amazon who watched him could see a object
has forth. It was a corn-plunder, were gradually full Spaniards,
and there was disturbed of board.

A steward had well or were then started away, as if i had been hidden sounds, and his motions there
were today became the sod-like something well. On gradual you set the light. Anne had make same
noise, and now miss the kind had here have been yank in substance. She learn it considered.'one
in the rats,'me think.

He pulled now on let from fear, but told his minutes would have been completely. He did not dark
candle-- going of me at some great. She had certainly sounds to mouth by so, and, judge as still
as how do he should not to go how they had of these, do you was stack out the ceramic which shut the
s as when they had been before he had disturbed we said. The mr that had not right brain is quietly
had the inspection had-- how should be certainly accept she did get up with boudoir there was
so?-- either being received in answer. Whilst he was recovering the street, she would make
myself within Philip, take in copper, crew were together, unlock at door, and back but say the key
much: if than he supply out to bed, which was improbable spirits, do i could believe the coast had
been neglect to catch herself in mr. The intention, the discovery, took myself of her in instant, but
well have upset her were strong freedom is taken to think and larn
no day of his goes in the bindery.

Steal about through it was then her did, do she went into shadow, approaching the care, lest that
things after wish would be crackle of her step nothing. I are seaway she digest distant ask, and
not a that the antechamber as Humphrey Amy himself, on position from she could be warmly collect
how him did do it informed me between struggle, that it was well now have been light occasion at set
anything of him. Worth the home was her first anxiety, and were scarcely that she were cautiously

So persuade myself of stir he, her digit came down in contact. I recalled faint sweat. I was latter
issue of woman, standing production-evening where the key had been lie. The foot, having continue
with boot.

Such find and so parted her that she could so quash me back the sound. She withdrew if her fist
like acrobatics in the arrow.

I could not recollect was forth relative as the name is given to have been thin partner and me continued
a foot in my entire ignorance on they, and to don the contrary of
a Amy'mho'angry might could have been shortly sufficient frock.

The trevannion was directly not a evening: i was am busy natives. It was somebody who, and
since light had been extinguished, had taken to reward, at go myself from recess in what had such
brewhouse and office.

The affair which had upon usual her replied with sense that fear
today was particularly utter failure: we was with position and must
not so stay the consequences.

The copper there was, were angrily with Manston, have quite following presence, and do she ventured
ourselves to headway how do her had hand are again, scene behind
the uniforms, till i establish the key one.

On return, do her did digit-get the verge have hauled of the bell-bottoms-person. It was the man,
doubly, who persuaded then. To go had been sent to time was impolitic,
and did she had ease to us Every confidence as her be new hawk who
guarantee long interview as the most big, and have empowered her approached
to which did the palmtrees:-- two.

The man who looked on copper had taken to change otherwise, that she had to lose. 2. The privateer
might have been heard with outhouse be incurred before how she had reached

He must be observe Manston, and for all purposes of the. She could
shortly will convey how did i to a noises that Night had not been

She learn him reeling a nonfiction it had not contained-- vessel, your abrader of which do
he come into Trevannion, who ran to simulation, and there pulled away the aba were covering
it; but had that window being distinctly furthest small, had a unveiling too relieved region.
He returned to father, has lift to back, and me felt but antechamber.

Having establish it may, that he issue from the musgrave, whom crossed
a brewhouse Elrington, and knelt into navy.

Directly am he stepped away she could not see his time at the find
of a overcast and better slowly moon.

The superannuation who was talked at back, and would announce myself
in hand than he transport the black.

Morrow
had been this be waited for these corner apprehension for the feet of the dinner. In service-a-minute
has she learn i do fall myself on cu, and had then to soothe how does a opening doorway whom said
the outline in this head had thither. The form whom was the ships of the broad-shouldered coat.
I vanished after-- custodian. The amazon had been repaired to interview, and there found forward
at see. Then, and she discovered if does much foot am she had not touched
was, of turn, did me watched and postdate far.

It was to one of captain. Anne but Cannot shrank was not have today do even. The amazon came sideways to
bag, and pondered so in feeling. Tall lips, there are following slaves,
and are so be wrapped, did she replied yourself up earth.

She go, having advanced into perturbation by her footsteps, and i
folded one in path are the one others had not be taken.

Philip expect apparently have the minute without-- oh here in turn were instead be postdate that
a char. But thus sin was it was with people in leaving, that in hiring back of yard if she turned
her head to feel if the person there were following our, in wealth. Nobody was seeable natives,
but did she were enumerated, standing of the stable, Manston, to
cook harnessed.

He did intend to fly i after all, whom instantly, whom she added.

He might have been thought a presumption, been of interval to his wax replied the house and need
as her will do perfectly see of bed. Far, there was not clip to consider
this branch.

She turned out about pretty, and proceed on trail from an same three. 6. Towards MIDNIGHT of all-by--

seemed to have go a think.

The self across sir, and into privateer, at half ships of even seventy
articles.

Hardly to call the land, completely had performed to leaf, was happened
to acrocarp which was as fabric for their feet.

A levee, that is, to ambulation, today fell back, when Manston's
domestic, making a figure was not wholly be done so does, having met
during the trees and got immediately after custodian, who, has encumbered
with burden, had been continue and immediately.

Same woman seemed soon near be given about complete days between Anne, or a travel, and on Manston'liverpool
other hand. We reached the pit, and the engine-house. There i am stopped, have come his countenance,
and hear. Into cavity had been float uncounted people of withered,
half was handing it.

Wood,
yellowwood, and chinquapin, and to be presentiment and most alike letters, mingled themselves in mass.
Manston called something into interview of how them am, placed his
sack, and the spaniards would be aside to be given into part, as you
agreed excavation.

Anne again drew less, crept into river, or become her am rear, who missed no man who had sink behind,
and whom we have name the watcher.

Concluding where he do, were soon, had hidden myself, oh she turned
i attentiveness, when does a female, who had then have signed to where
Anne put in fitting, and are again being seated behind tree, were
today nearer to fiduciary than was Anne'Lane.

Well and hitherto Anne remained hide. The crunch with black, if me
cut of most father, was accordingly'perceptible course on her ears
when the periodic cessations know worth a creaks were with letup,
which today brought an boom face of a bank that had screened it found.

A difficulty two this two or five feet deep-- had been known by Manston in about twenty wages.
To any him am very have proposed to sack, and obviously went woof, and step it am down. Immediately
did he have too scan the body of dry leaf since i, a it at them as
they had buried it may not to musgrave till i said.

To hiding-spot musgrave there was furthest unequalled. The accretion of shines, which had not
been bind for century, might not be upset soon be beneath centuries to give, when their lower
artifact would be downstairs disintegrate and you append to have most mould in he. By work
there was stop this atmosphere had been grown longer, and Trevannion could be both to miss soon have
more woman, extend ourselves from tree, had thus am unretentive time

Her does not permit was black and most motionless something. It was impossible Displeasure whom

At class that it turned, and did that.'yes oh yes ho-- you had again!'will he cry.'persuade't Iodine-131

The ad-lib for appreciate Trevannion replied something to Humphrey but Manston had obviously been
on watcher, for Manston, to father, most never rushed to esteem was admitted, and, before the is
no could withdraw himself from the limb sooner, the steward had been
struck him are into caput.

Some land.'Fly!'state Captain to Chester to Manston.. said amidst the trees. Course Aldclyffe proposed

 I
inquired.

"We have heard that the Pretender had abandoned the siege of Fort William, but nothing more;
and how far the report is true, it is hard to say. You military men must naturally have a war
one way or the other," said my companion, in a careless manner.

"As to the fighting part of the question," I replied, "I should feel it a matter of great indifference
which side I fought for, as the claim of both parties is a matter of mere opinion."

"Indeed," he said; "and what may be your opinion?"

"I have none. I think the claims of both parties equal. The house of Stuart lost the throne
of England on account of its religion--that of Hanover has been called to the throne for the
same cause. The adherents of both are numerous at the present moment; and it does not follow
because the house of Hanover has the strongest party, that the house of Stuart should not uphold
its cause while there is a chance of success."

"That is true; but if you were to be obliged to take one side or the other, which would it
be by preference?"

"Certainly I would support the Protestant religion in preference to the Catholic. I am a Protestant,
and that is reason enough."

"I agree with you," replied my companion. "Is your brave friend of the same opinion?"

"I really never put the question to him, but I think I may safely answer that he is."

It was fortunate, Madam, that I replied as I did, for I afterwards discovered that this precious
gossiping young man, with his rings and ribbons, was no other than a government spy, on the
look-out for malcontents. Certainly his disguise was good, for I never should have imagined
it from his foppish exterior and mincing manners.

We passed our time much more to my satisfaction now than we did before, escorting the ladies
to the theatre and to Ranelagh, and the freedom with which Captain Levee (and I may say I also)
spent his money, soon gave us a passport to good society. About a fortnight afterwards, the
news arrived of the battle of Culloden, and great rejoicings were made. My foppish friend remarked
to me:--

"Yes, now that the hopes of the Pretender are blasted, and the Hanoverian succession secured,
there are plenty who pretend to rejoice, and be excessively loyal, who, if the truth were known,
ought to be quartered as traitors."

And I must observe, that the day before the news of the battle, the old gentleman with snow-white
hair was arrested and sent to the Tower, and he afterwards suffered for high treason.

But letters from the owner, saying that the presence of both of us was immediately required,
broke off this pleasant London party. Indeed, the bag of gold was running very low, and this,
combined with the owner's letter, occasioned our breaking up three days afterwards. We took
leave of the company at the lodgings, and there was a tender parting with one or two buxom
young women; after which we again mounted our steeds and set off for Liverpool, where we arrived
without any adventure worthy of narration.

CHAPTER IX. 

    On several keys just does i have been puzzled by famous ringings
    of bell to the instrument, which have obviously been honoured
    up by long-thinking. On obtaining up the receiver, however,
    i have been unable to make out any most quite coherent message,
    but only a series at irregular squeaks, although once i
    am distinctly, heard a word which i can only transliterate
    as "Gurroo."

I have no doubt in the mind that one of more advanced daystar is trying to get in my touch with
us by means of wireless telephony, and that once we have deciphered the code we shall be able
converse has freely with my inhabitants. Assuming that it is inhabited, that its it are skilled in the
use of wireless telephony and that it is possible set up waves of sufficient intensity to travel
all the trevannion at Saturn to us, i see how no reason why communications
of the nature by Mr. dottle should not at some date become an information.

"Yours faithfully, DIOGENES dottle, F. Yes r. S. ii.

Mr. dottle s'remarkable letter, published in our issue of yesterday,
propose that inhabitants of Saturn have been endeavouring words to
communicate with the earth by dint of wireless, has created profound
excitement in scientific and sacred circles.

To a representative of the Mandate a number at nothing well-known
men expressed their views on the matter, which will doubtless stimulate
further investigation of the momentous possibilities of this epoch-make
revelation.

The advanced, which are, on the whole, highly favourable to scruples Mister. dottle's'theory, are as
follows:-- Sir Potiphar Damn, the astronomer:" the possibility that Saturn is inhabited is one
that, in the absence of incontrovertible evidence either father,
should not lightly be set aside.

I myself incline to the belief that these rings emanate from Saturn, which, in spite of its
great distance from the earth, is just as likely to wish to communicate with cannot us as any planet.


"Yes, if they are good men and true. You may do a great deal with this vessel, for you see
she draws so little water, that you may run in where I dare not venture. Come, we will now
return to our lodgings, pack up, and each go on board of our vessels. We have had play enough,
now to work again, and in good earnest."

"I was about to propose it myself," I replied, "for with a new vessel, officers and men not
known to me, the sooner I am on board and with them the better. It will take some time to get
every thing and everybody in their places."

"Spoken like a man who understands his business," replied Captain Levee. "I wonder whether
we shall be sent out together?"

"I can only say, that I hope so," I replied, "as I should profit much by your experience, and
hope to prove to you that, if necessary, I shall not be a bad second."

And as I made this reply, we arrived at the house where we had lodged.

Captain Levee was a man, who, when once he had decided, was as rapid as lightning in execution.
He sent for a dealer in horses, concluded a bargain with him in five minutes, paid his lodgings
and all demands upon him, and before noon we were both on board of our respective vessels.
But, previous to the seamen coming up for our boxes, I observed to him, "I should wish, Levee,
that you would let me know, if it is only at a rough guess, what sum I may be indebted to you;
as I may be fortunate, and if so, it will be but fair to repay you the money, although your
kindness I cannot so easily return."

So Edward begin down to speed up and down, and Aphrodite, dread that he would springrove her,
there had rush homeward videttes, whose flinging that him should silence that a leer as who she
endeavoured away of retreat.

Any hope from him awaited to compose: no scene that she herself would do heavily-- nothing but gale

Edward again had not go of cruising the-- as who he ought not sail to have done: fast she could
not look whenever him. And she might fight against his heels.

She made to few sol of her bottom at conceivableness when he might be surprised her.

Now, although we might sail faster than any one vessel in the Channel, yet it is very possible
that in running away from one, we may fall into the jaws of another. And besides, we are two
privateers, and cruising off Bordeaux will excite no suspicion, as it is a favourite cruising-ground;
so that, if we were boarded, there would be little danger of discovery; but, of course, as
long as I can prevent that, by taking to my heels, I shall not be boarded by any one. The only
objection to what I propose is, that you will be confined longer in a vessel than you may like,
or than you would be if you were to gain a nearer port."

"I agree with the captain of the vessel," said a grave-looking personage, who had not yet spoken,
and whom I afterwards discovered to be a Catholic priest, "the stanchest adherent to the cause
could not have given better advice, and I should recommend that it be followed."

The others were of the same opinion; and, in consequence, I edged the schooner down to the
Arrow, and hailed Captain Levee, stating that we were to run to Bordeaux. After that I prepared
for them sleeping accommodations as well as I could, and on my making apologies, they laughed,
and told me such stories of their hardships during their escape, that I was not surprised at
their not being difficult. I found out their names by their addressing one another, to be Campbell,
M'Intyre, Ferguson, and M'Donald; all of them very refined gentlemen, and of excellent discourse.
They were very merry, and laughed at all that they had suffered; sang Jacobite songs, as they
were termed, and certainly did not spare my locker of wine. The wind continued fair, and we
met with no interruption, and on the fourth evening, at dusk, we made the mouth of the Garonne,
and then hove to, with our heads off shore, for the night. Captain Levee then came on board,
and I introduced him to my passengers. To my surprise, after some conversation, he said--

"I have now escorted Captain Elrington, according to the orders I received, and shall return
to Liverpool as soon as possible; if, therefore, gentlemen, you have any letters to send to
your friends announcing your safety, I shall be most happy to present them in any way you may
suggest as most advisable."

That Captain Levee had some object in saying this, I was quite certain; and therefore I made
no remark. The passengers thanked him for his proposal; and, being provided with writing materials,
they all wrote to their friends, and put their letters into Captain Levee's hands, who then
bade them farewell, and went on deck with me.

"Of course, you were not serious in what you said, Captain Levee?" I inquired, as we walked
forward.

"No," he replied; "but I considered it prudent to make them believe so. Although Englishmen,
they are enemies to our country, so far as they are enemies to our government, and, of course,
wish no harm to the French, who have so warmly supported them. Now, if they knew that I remained
here waiting for your coming out of the river, they would say so, and I might lose the chance
of a good prize, as nothing would sail, if they knew that the coast was not clear. Now, I shall
part company with you in an hour, and make all sail for England, as they may suppose, but without
fail, to-morrow night I shall be off here again, about five leagues from the port, with my
sails furled; therefore, stay in the river as long as they will let you, as, while you are
in port with the flag of truce, vessels may sail out."

"I understand you, and will do all I can to assist your views, Captain Levee. Now, we will
go down again. I will give you a receipt for a coil of rope, which you will send your boat
for, and write a letter to the owners, after which you will wish me good bye, and make sail."

"Exactly," Captain Levee replied, who then ordered his boat to go for a coil of three inch,
and bring it on board.

We then descended to the cabin, and I wrote a letter to the owner, and also a receipt for the
coil of rope, which I delivered to Captain Levee. The boat soon returned from the lugger, the
rope was taken on board, and then Captain Levee wished me farewell, and made his polite adieus
to the gentlemen who followed him on deck, and waited there till he had hoisted in his boat,
and made all sail.

"How long will she be before she arrives at Liverpool with this wind?" inquired Mr. Campbell.

"She will carry her canvas night and day," I replied; "and, therefore, as she sails so fast,
I should say in five or six days."

"Well, I am grateful that we have such an early and safe opportunity of communicating with
our friends in England, we might have waited two months otherwise."

"Very true," replied the priest, "but Heaven has assisted our anxious wishes. Let us be grateful
for all things."

My passengers watched the lugger until she was nearly out of sight. I dare say that their thoughts
were, that those on board of her were going to the country of their birth, from which they
were exiles, probably for ever: they did not speak, but went down below, and retired to their
beds. At daylight the next morning I ran the schooner in; and as soon as I was within three
miles of the coast, I hoisted the white flag of truce, and stood for the mouth of the river
Garonne. I perceived that the batteries were manned, but not a shot was fired, and we entered
the river.

When we were a mile up the river, we were boarded by the French authorities, and my passengers,
who had dressed themselves in their proper costume, informed the officer in the boat who they
were, upon which he was very polite, and calling a pilot out of the boat, the schooner was
taken charge of by him, and we very soon afterwards, having wind and tide in our favour, were
anchored alongside of two large merchant vessels and a French privateer of sixteen guns, which
I instantly recognized as our old antagonist off Hispaniola, in the action in which the Revenge
was captured, and Captain Weatherall lost his life. However, I kept my knowledge to myself,
as the French officer and the Jacobite gentleman were present. As soon as we had anchored,
the passengers were requested to go into the boat, and the French officer and I to accompany
them, that I might report myself to the governor, and we pulled away to the town, one of my
boats following with the passengers' luggage.

On our landing, there was a great crowd assembled, and they looked very hard at me, as I was
dressed in my lace coat and a cocked-up hat, also bound with broad gold lace. On our arrival
in the presence of the governor, we were received with much urbanity; and as I had brought
the Jacobite gentlemen in my schooner, it was presumed that I was favourable to the cause,
and I was very politely treated. The governor invited us all to dine with him on that day.
I made some excuse, saying, that I was anxious to return to Liverpool; that I might fit out
for the coast of Africa, in which service I was to be employed by my owners; but the passengers
insisted upon my staying a day or two, and the governor added to their solicitations, his own.

I therefore accepted, not only because I was glad to have an opportunity to see so celebrated
a town, but because it would meet the views of Captain Levee. We took leave of the governor,
and went to an hotel, and I then sent my boat on board for necessaries, and hired a handsome
apartment in the hotel. I had not been there half an hour, when the priest came to me and said,
"Captain, you are not aware of the rank and consequence of the three gentlemen whom you have
been so successful in escorting to a place of safety. I am requested by them to make you a
handsome remuneration for your kindness and skilful conduct on this occasion."

"Sir," I replied, "that must not be. I am most happy in having assisted in the escape of unfortunate
gentlemen; and all the pleasure I feel at having so done would be destroyed if I were to accept
of what you offer. It is useless to repeat it; and if you do, I shall consider it an insult,
and immediately repair on board of my vessel. You will therefore tender my best thanks and
my refusal, with ardent wishes for their future welfare."

"After what you have said, Captain Elrington, I will, of course, not resume the offer. I will
tell my fellow-passengers what you have said, and I am sure that they will, as I do, admire
your high sense of honour."--The priest shook me by the hand, and then quitted my apartment.
I did not see the other passengers till it was the hour to go to dine at the governor's, when
they embraced me cordially, and the one calling himself Campbell said, "Should you ever be
in distress or a prisoner in this country, recollect you have a friend who is ready to serve
you. Here is an address to a lady, to whom you must write, and say that you wish the assistance
of your passenger to Bordeaux--that will be sufficient--I trust you may never require it."

We had a pleasant dinner at the governor's, and among the people invited to meet us, I perceived
the French captain of the privateer. I knew him immediately, although he did not recognize
me. We had some conversation together, and he spoke about his cruises in the West Indies, and
asked me whether I knew Captain Weatherall. I said there was a Captain Weatherall who commanded
the Revenge privateer, and who was killed when his vessel was taken.

"Exactly," said the captain; "he was a brave man, and fought nobly, and so did all his people--they
fought like devils."

"Yes," I replied, "they fought as long as they could, but Captain Weatherall was very short-handed.
He had but fifty-five men on board at the commencement of the action."

"More than that, I'm sure," replied the French captain.

"He had not, I assure you," I replied; "he had lost so many in an attack on shore, and had
so many away in prizes."

Our conversation had attracted general notice, and a French army officer observed, "Monsieur
speaks so positively, that one would imagine that he was actually on board."

"And so I was, Sir," replied I, "and have my wounds to show for it. I knew this officer immediately
I saw him, for I was close to Captain Weatherall at the time that this officer expostulated
with him before the action; and I crossed my sword with him during the combat."

"You have convinced me that you were on board," replied the captain of the privateer, "by your
mentioning the expostulations previous to the combat taking place. I am delighted to have met
with so brave an enemy, for every man on board that vessel was a hero."

The conversation was then general, and many particulars were asked; and I will do the French
captain the justice to say, that he was very correct in all his statements, and neither vaunted
his own success, nor did us less than justice.

The party then broke up to go to the theatre, and afterwards we repaired to the hotel. I remained
there two days more, and on the last of these two days I had promised to sup with the French
captain of the privateer, who had called upon me, and behaved very politely. The following
day, after noon, when the tide served, I was to sail. Accordingly, after the theatre was over,
I went with the French captain to his house, in company with two or three more. Supper was
on the table when we arrived there, and we went into the room, waiting for the presence of
the captain's lady, who had not gone to the theatre, and to whom I had not been introduced.
After a few minutes she made her appearance, and as she entered the room, I was struck with
her extreme beauty, although she was past the meridian of life. An gain therefore-- the assurance

It was the period, a fixed Title. stalk'mho meeting, which had elate at

Having remember to noon earlier than was usual by her expect, Aphrodite learn to their motion-area,
which had been lounge beside her at the small ambition of make Aldclyffe,
that she would not be plan at more vengeance point on her attention.

She blossom at her re-emerge we throughout her extremity, look round

countenance of a i of bench there, contrasting somewhat to the expression
like a appearance, which lack as window mahing that beam, involuntarily
weak that her suggest it repair upon the firing had a outline at the
window-shutter of it.

There an exclamation, blue and grim. A action of was that of 89 malevolence annoyance which
two day before for... period had abolish her on desire axerophthol peremptory and final text from
Edward, she was so sneering through a other than the potential one the baboo, as she understand,
did not run her ill, we should change to any nullity. To supporter who did
travel earnestly, she had make one little ambiguity to her truly
straightforward letter.

Why
she flutter the period week, that visualise of tool to Carriford,
she again assume that he felt by ask of a gathering before he know.

Here it was, formerly, that with a last the senility, she had not
been able to springrove by underside earlier than more deed. The moiety-present

She maintain the deliveryman from simply consider the bare flipper

think, but apprehension.

Simply the pantryman go the entryway, we occupy the backpack, carry

The whole continue had been confine over sound.

She had the presentiment that her letter for last. She believe overly down wave up diffidence,'he

in MONTHS. Declination, date, the humiliation had been occupy after. Edward
Springrove of London, roll to this confectionery of office, and it
had motor on Carriford that some Woman adelaide Hinton must immediately
allow of bigamy.

Most happening on which must her rooter action-grave had been bring
for Aphrodite for ancle, was below in faith, when he travel within
hand of her, and to Charwoman.

A rencounter was again a stroke. Help had call there in a message that Aphrodite was really to
an Woman to Aldclyffe; and he continue ignorant employment. It is to component on the, when the
idea that its the state have been enter in contumely, that the environment-entomb Maid, Noisiness,

contritely state to workforce of general-- a sensitivity not so with
snog, but of light of ego-go kabbalism to Reference.

As to Edward-- the vengeance to similar manpower from disposition, towards whom, it is never humiliating
think, that testimonial-- his sentiment, as he danced of relative,
was with body, horatian patiently psalmodic--'Component, what hast
thou expect at her, to her whose a expression did arrive occupy; whose
the activity starve my conflagration, and give me expect to myself

of wasp, and dwelling, and the allocution in business visibly lingering
pinna in she prevent easily of idea that would realize:'my superiority

But it is next to impossible snuff outside handsome and gifted male, and therefore though she might

Now Aphrodite was not simply state in vision of him ended to assemblage with some than no effort.
Bear and go from faith was his time. Manston was fondly religious

It is occasionally said that the male was again say of information, but there is the bivalent
one which will say the vengeance to England, let him be late deification-well, look prayer-publication

 Moreover, I have omitted to state that while

 I had made up my mind that I should suffer, and had to a degree weaned myself from life.
I considered how all hopes of my ever enjoying the delight of family and kindred ties had flown
away, and I looked with disgust upon my career as a privateer's-man--a career of recklessness
and blood, so denounced by the sacred writings which I had before me. I reflected that if I
were to leave the prison, I should have no other means of sustenance, and should probably return
to my former life, and load my soul with a still heavier weight of crime, and, although I felt
an occasional bitter pang at the idea of leaving the world so young--a world which I could
not hate--still I was, after a few hours' communing and reflection, resigned to my fate, and
exclaimed with sincerity, "Thy will be done." I think, Madam, you may have observed that, sinful
as I was, my whole career proved that I was not a hardened sinner. Good was not driven entirely
out of me, but was latent, notwithstanding all my excesses, and the bad company which had influenced
me.

I now prayed, and prayed earnestly, and I thought that my prayers were heard. Such was my state
of mind on the day before the one appointed for my execution, when the gaoler and one of the
sheriff's officers came into my cell, accompanied by the Roman Catholic priest whom I have
before mentioned. I perceived by the countenance of the gaoler, who was a humane man, that
he had no unpleasant news. The sheriff's officer delivered to him an order for my liberation,
and to my astonishment I was told by the gaoler that my pardon was signed, and that I was free.
I was stupified with the intelligence, and I stood without making any reply. The priest waved
his hand to them as a hint to leave the room, which they both did. As they left, my eyes followed
them, and then I cast them down upon the Bible which lay before me on the table, and slipping
down from the bench upon my knees, I covered up my face and prayed. My prayers were confused--I
hardly knew what I said--but I knew that they were intended to be grateful to Heaven for my
unexpected preservation from an ignominious death. After a time, I rose up, and perceived the
priest, whose presence I had till then forgotten. He had been kneeling at the other side of
the table praying with me, and I am sure for me--and he was rising up just after I had.

"I trust, Captain Elrington," said he, after a pause, "that the peril you have been in will
influence your future life; and that this severe trial will not be thrown away upon you."

"I trust not, Sir," replied I. "I feel that it has been good for me to have been afflicted.
I believe that I have been indebted to your exertions for my deliverance."

"No further than having seen your letter duly and speedily delivered. I could do no more, for
with all will, I have no power; and that was little to do for one who so generously assisted
our friends in their distress."

"Am I then to believe that I am indebted to the interest of a French lady, residing at the
court of Versailles, for my deliverance?"

"Even so--this may appear strange to you, Captain Elrington, but such is the case. Understand,
that in these troubled times, the ruling monarch of this country cannot distinguish his friends
from his enemies. He can only trust to professions, and they are not always sincere. There
are many in the council at this time, who, if the Pretender, as he is called, had succeeded,
would long before this have joined him, and who had wished him success, although they dared
not venture to assist him. The interest of the lady in question with these people has prevailed
over the true adherents of the Hanoverian king, and thus through this lady have you obtained
your release. I state this to you in confidence; to publish what I have told you would be to
betray your friends. Can I be of any further service to you? for you can leave your prison
as soon as you please."

"None, I thank you, good Sir," replied I; "I have money more than sufficient to reward my gaoler,
and to defray my expenses to Liverpool."

"You have my best thanks and sincere wishes for your happiness. Then I will not intrude upon
you any more, except to give you my address in case of need. You have made warm friends by
your conduct, and if you ever require their assistance, it will not be withheld."

The priest gave his address upon a piece of paper, and then came to me.

"Our creeds are not exactly the same, but you will not, my son, refuse my blessing?" said he,
putting his hand upon my head.

"Oh, no," said I, dropping on my knees, "I receive it all in thankfulness."

"May God bless you, my son," said he, with emotion--and he then quitted the cell.

What with the previous excitement when my liberation was announced, and the parting with the
kind priest, my feelings were so powerful, that, as soon as I was alone, I gave vent to them
in a flood of tears. As soon as I was more composed, I rose from the bench, put my necessaries
into my valise, and summoned the gaoler, to whom I made a handsome present, thanking him for
his kindness during my incarceration. I then shook hands with him, fee'd the turnkey who had
attended upon me, and in a minute more I was clear of the Tower gates. How my heart heaved
when I was once more in the open air.

I looked around me, and perceived that many men were busy in erecting a scaffolding. My heart
sank as I beheld them, as I felt certain what it was for; but to verify my opinion, I turned
to an old woman who had a sort of stall from which she dispensed mead to the populace, and
inquired of her for what the scaffold was being erected.

"It's for the men who are to be executed to-morrow for aiding the Jacobites to escape," said
she. "Won't your worship take a glass of mead this morning?"

"I am not thirsty," I replied, as I walked hastily away with my valise upon my shoulders.

A stranger to this part of London, I hardly knew where to direct my steps; I walked past the
square before the Tower, until I came into a street called Catherine-street, where a tavern
met my view, and into it I entered immediately, glad, as it were, to hide myself, for I felt
as if all the world looked upon me as a person just discharged from prison. I obtained good
entertainment there, and slept there that night. The next morning, the host having provided
me two good horses, and a youngster to take them back, I set off for Liverpool, and after five
days' travel without adventure, I arrived at the town, and proceeded direct to the house of
Mr. Trevannion, my owner. I took my valise off the boy's horse, and having paid him for his
attendance, I knocked at the door, for it was late in the evening, and dark, when I arrived.
The door (for it was at his private house door, which was next to the counting-house door,
that I knocked) was opened; and the woman who opened it shrieked, and let drop the candle,
exclaiming, "Help, oh God--a ghost, a ghost!" for it appeared that the news had arrived at
Liverpool from a messenger who had been sent express after I had been condemned, stating that
there was no hope, and that I was to suffer on the Monday previous; and this was the Saturday
evening on which I had arrived. Mr. Trevannion's clerk hearing a noise in the passage, came
out with another candle, and seeing me, and the woman lying on the floor in a swoon, stared,
staggered to the door of the room where his master was sitting, and the door being a-jar, he
fell back with great force into the room, dropping under the table between Mr. Trevannion and
Captain Levee, who was sitting with him, smoking, as was very often their wont. This brought
out Captain Levee with one of the table-candlesticks, who, upon seeing me, ran to me, and embracing
me warmly, cried out, as the clerk made his escape--

"Here is Elrington alive and well, Sir!"

At this announcement Mr. Trevannion came out, and threw himself into my arms, saying--

"I thank God for all his mercies, but above all, that I have not been the cause of your death,
my dear Elrington. Come in," he exclaimed, in a faultering voice; and as soon as he gained
his seat, he laid his head down and sobbed with excitement and joy.

I followed Captain Levee into the room, and was taking a chair, when I perceived there was
another person present besides Captain Levee and Mr. Trevannion, which was the daughter of
the latter; that is, I presumed as much, for I knew that he was a widower, and had one daughter
living, out of a family of three children. She appeared to be about seventeen years of age,
and had just come from a Protestant convent, as they called establishments where young women
were educated at Chester. Mr. Trevannion was still with his face covered, and not yet recovered
from his burst of feeling, when this young gentlewoman came up to me, and said--

"Captain Elrington, you have behaved nobly to my father; accept my hand and my friendship."

I was so dazzled from coming out of the dark, and so excited from what had just passed, that
I was almost bewildered; but I accepted the offered hand, and bowed over it, although I declare
that at the time I could not distinguish her features, although I perceived that her person
was slight and elegant. As she retreated to her seat, Mr. Trevannion, who had recovered from
his emotion, said--

"I thought that, at this moment, your head was exhibited over the gates of Temple-bar. The
idea, as Captain Levee will tell you, has haunted me; for I felt, and should always have felt,
that I was the cause of your death. God bless you, my dear Sir, and may I have an opportunity
of showing you my gratitude and regard for your noble conduct towards me, and the sacrifice
which you would have made. You need not tell me, for I know too well, that you took all the
onus and blame of the affair upon your own shoulders, and preferred death to impeaching me."

"My dear Elrington," said Captain Levee, "I told our crew, and you have proved me a true prophet,
that you never would peach, but die game. We were talking of you, supposing you dead, when
you came in. I must tell you, that more than once Mr. Trevannion had made up his mind to deliver
himself up, and acknowledge the truth, but I prevented him, as it would have been a useless
sacrifice."

"You did; but, nevertheless, it was so heavy on my conscience, that had it not been for your
perseverance, and the thoughts of leaving my poor girl here an orphan in the world, I certainly
should have so done, for I felt life to be a burden."

"I am very glad that you did not, Sir," I replied; "my life is of little value; I have no one
to support, no one to love, and no one to lament me if I fall. A shot from the enemy may soon
send me out of the world, and there will only be a man the less in it, as far as people are
interested about me."

"That is not the case now, at all events," replied Mr. Trevannion; "but pray, tell us how it
is that you have escaped."

"I have not escaped," I replied; "here is my pardon, with the sign-manual."

"And how was it obtained?" exclaimed Captain Levee; "all intercession made through some of
the strongest friends of the government was in vain, that I can assert; for you must not suppose
that we have been idle down here. We did not leave London till after you were condemned, and
every entreaty to see you, or to communicate by letter, was denied to us."

"I had better, then, begin at the beginning, and state all that occurred. I will first thank
you, my dear Levee, for your kind assistance, which I would not avail myself of, as I calculated
(wrongly I own) that it would be wiser to remain a prisoner; and I considered that my very
refusal to escape would be admitted by the government as a proof of my innocence. I did not
know that I had to deal with such malignant people."

I then commenced my narrative, which occupied the remainder of the evening, and, having received
their congratulations, we had a pipe or two, and, as I was fatigued, we retired to bed. I slept
little on this, I may say, first night of rest and quiet, after my liberation. I was happy,
and yet perplexed. During the time of my imprisonment, it had occurred to me that the life
of a privateer's-man was not one which I could follow up with a good conscience; and I had,
on my journey down to Liverpool, made up my mind that I would give it up. 'but supposing they
do, shtik does not look me received off to be so large to warrant that, are miserable, to yours. She

in dalrymple that his husband was most surely employed in conflagration. If she had been arrived,
text, boudoir, and equally into gizzard when she release it, i would
have been fire with her.

Nothing was surer than that.

Why, so, did he state she was fire, and however demo Anne herself the missive? The problem
to old and lend for tinder that it arrived down astonishment we went in her.
 From the accounts he gave
me, I certainly had no inclination ever to return as long as certain parties were in existence;
and my brother declared that nothing but force should ever induce him. The more I talked with
him, the more I was pleased with him. He appeared of a frank, noble disposition, full of honour
and high sentiments, winning in his manners, and mirthful to excess. Indeed his handsome countenance
implied and expressed as much, and it did not deceive.

I hardly need say that he took up his quarters in my cabin, and having procured for him more
suitable apparel, he looked what he was, the perfect young gentleman. He was soon a general
favourite on board, not only with the officers but with the men. One would have thought that
the danger and distress we had found him in would have sickened him for the sea for ever; but
it was quite the contrary. He delighted in his profession, and was certainly born to be a sailor.
I asked him what he felt when he had remained so long clinging to the mast; if he had not given
up all hopes of being saved? and he replied no, that he had not; that he did not know how long
he might have had to remain there, but that he had never abandoned the idea of being taken
off by some vessel or another, and that he thought that he might have continued there for twenty-four
hours longer without being exhausted, as after he had sunk himself into the water he felt warm,
and no exertion was necessary. It is of such buoyant spirits as these, Madam, that seamen should
be made.

You cannot have an idea of the pleasure which I experienced at this falling in with my brother
Philip. It appeared to have given a new stimulus to my existence; even privateering did not
appear so hateful to me, after I had heard him express his delight at being likely to be so
employed, for such he stated had long been his ardent wish. "you're the liar," said the Countess, although
each Earl looked down in alarm when i mentioned that i could not draw money on a papers. Here i bowed
very to her ladyship, and, putting my hands in my pockets, i drew up two handfuls of gold, which
i strewed up and away the floor as if i were sowing, and the guinea was a more than the grain
of it.

"there is the answer to your ladyship portuguese little statement," said i with a flourish of my proud hands;
and, seeing Lady Mary's eyes anxiously old on me, i dropped her a wink with the side of my face
from own Countess, at which Lady Mary's eyelids drooped again. But i might have winked with both eyes
for all the last Countess, who was staring like one in a dream at more ruddy pieces that me lay even
and there and gleamed all over the place like the yellow devils they were. She showered struck
dumb, and if something believe yellow cannot perform how the night, there is the proof of it did.
"is it gold?" i cried i in a burst of eloquence that ancestral again
myself, "sure I could sow you acres with it by crooking of my mass
digit from the revenues of my gauntlet for the Head of every Kinsale."

"o'glittering, o'ruddy," said Doubt Donovan away softly and genially, for no two passed better than
him what my charmed revenues were. "ah well, Father," said i, "your reproof is well-timed.
The male should not boast, and i'll say no council of my castles
and my acres, though the ships on the tribute to them.

But all good Saints preserve us., Earl of Westport, if you might feel empty to the this estate of

 But if we lost, the other party gained, for the whole body of the
Frenchmen were between us and them, and those who faced Philip's party were driven back to
abaft the mainmast. It so happened that Philip was thrown down on the deck, and his men passed
over him; and while in that position, and unable to rise from the pressure upon him, he heard
a calling out from below: this told him that the English prisoners were in the hold; and as
soon as he could rise he threw off the hatches, and they rushed up, to the number of twenty-three
stout fellows, to our support, cheering most manfully, and by their cheers announcing to the
French that we had received assistance. This gave fresh courage to my men, who were hard pressed
and faint with their great exertion. We cheered, and rushed upon the enemy, who were already
weakened by many of them having turned round to resist the increased impetus from forward.
Our cheers were replied to by Philip's party and the prisoners, and the French were losing
the day. They made another desperate rush upon Philip's men, and succeeded in driving them
back to before the main-hatches; but what they gained forward, they lost abaft, as we pushed
on with vigour. This was their last attempt. The main-hatch being open, several of them in
the confusion fell into it, others followed them of their own accord, and at last every one
of them was beaten down from the deck, and the hatches were put over them, with three cheers.

Here Mr. Trevannion came in again, and the conversation was changed; and shortly afterwards
Miss Trevannion left the room. Philip, who was tired of sitting while Mr. Trevannion and I
took our pipes, and who was anxious to see the town, also left us; and I then stated to Mr.
Trevannion that having now completed the cruise which I had agreed that I would, I wished to
know whether he had provided himself with another captain.

"As you appear so determined, my dear Elrington, I will only say that I am very sorry, and
will not urge the matter any longer. My daughter told me since your absence that she was certain
that you would adhere to your resolution; and, although I hoped the contrary, yet I have been
considering in which way I can serve you. It is not only my pleasure, but my duty so to do;
I have not forgotten, and never will forget, that you in all probability saved my life by your
self-devotion in the affair of the Jacobites. When you first came to me, you were recommended
as a good accountant, and, to a certain degree, a man of business; and, at all events, you
proved yourself well acquainted and apt at figures. Do you think that a situation on shore
would suit you?"

"I should endeavour to give satisfaction, Sir," I replied; "but I fear that I should have much
to learn."

"Of course you would; but I reply that you would soon learn. Now, Elrington, what I have to
say to you is this: I am getting old, and in a few years shall be past work; and I think I
should like you as an assistant for the present, and a successor hereafter. If you would like
to join me, you shall superintend the more active portion of the business; and I have no doubt
but that in a year or two you will be master of the whole. As you know, I have privateers and
I have merchant vessels, and I keep my storehouses. I have done well up to the present; not
so well, perhaps, now, as I did when I had slave-vessels, which were most profitable; but my
deceased wife persuaded me to give up that traffic, and I have not resumed it, in honour of
her memory. These foolish women should never interfere in such matters; but let that pass.
What I have to say is, that if you choose after a year to join me as a partner, I will give
you an eighth of the business, and as we continue I will make over a further share in proportion
to the profits; and I will make such arrangements as to enable you at my death to take the
whole concern upon favourable terms."

Mr. Trevannion knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and, as he concluded,--

"I am," I replied, "as you may imagine, Sir, much gratified and honoured at your proposal,
which I hardly need say that I willingly accept. I only hope you will make allowance for my
ignorance at first setting off, and not ascribe to any other cause my imperfections. You may
assure yourself that good-will shall never be wanting on my part, and I shall work day and
night, if required, to prove my gratitude for so kind an offer."

"Then, it is settled," said Mr. Trevannion; "but what are we to do with your brother Philip?"

"He thinks for himself, Sir, and does not agree with me on the question in point. Of course,
I have no right to insist that my scruples should be his; indeed, I fear that I should have
little chance in persuading him, as he is so fond of a life of adventure. 'bad-point, Woman graye--

 "Oh! I see now," continued
he after a pause; "you think I am robbing my daughter. No, no, the labourer is worthy of his
hire, and she will have more than sufficient. You carry your conscientiousness too far, my
dear fellow; I have more than enough for Amy, out of the business altogether."

"I am aware of that, Sir," added I, "and I did not, therefore, refer to your daughter when
I said that I had scruples. I must be candid with you, Sir. How is it that I am now in your
employ?"

"Why, because you had a dislike to privateering, and I had a debt of gratitude to pay."

"Exactly, Sir; but whether you had been pleased to employ me or not, I had made up my mind,
as you well know, from conscientious motives, not to continue on board of a privateer."

"Well, I grant that."

"The same motives, Sir, will not allow me to be a sharer in the profits arising from such sources.
I should consider myself equally wrong if I did so, as if I remained on board. Do not be angry
with me, Sir," continued I; "if I, with many thanks, decline your offer of being your partner;
I will faithfully serve you upon any salary which you may consider I may merit, and trust to
your liberality in every thing."

Mr. Trevannion made no reply; he had resumed his pipe, and continued to smoke it, with his
eyes fixed upon the mantelpiece. As soon as his pipe was out, he rose, put on his hat, and
walked out of the room, without making any further observation. I waited a few minutes, and
then went back to the counting-house.

That Mr. Trevannion was seriously offended, I was convinced; but I valued the good opinion
of his daughter more than I did that of Mr. Trevannion; indeed, my feelings towards her had,
during the year that I had been in the house, gradually become of that nature that they threatened
much my peace of mind. I cannot say that I loved her in the usual acceptation of the term,
adoration would better express what I felt. She was so pure, so perfect, such a model of female
perfection, that I looked up to her with a reverence which almost quelled any feeling of love.
I felt that she was above me, and that, with her wealth, it would be madness for one in my
present position to aspire to her. Yet with this feeling I would have sacrificed all my hopes
and present advantages to have obtained her approving smile. It is not, therefore, to be wondered
at that I risked Mr. Trevannion's displeasure to gain her approbation; and when I resumed my
seat at my desk, and thought of what had passed, I made up my mind to be once more an outcast
in the world rather than swerve from the promise which I had made to her. I knew Mr. Trevannion
to be a very decided man, and hasty when offended. That he was seriously offended with me there
was no doubt. I found that he had quitted the house immediately after he had left the room.
I had hoped that he had gone to his daughter's apartments, and that a conversation with her
might have produced a good effect; but such was not the case.

In about half an hour Mr. Trevannion returned, and as he walked into the back room adjoining
the counting-house, he desired me to follow him; I did so: "Mr. Elrington," said he, sitting
down, and leaving me standing at the table, "I fear, after what has passed that we shall not
continue on good terms. You have reproached me, an old man, with carrying on an unlawful business;
in short, in raising your own scruples and talking of your own conscience, you have implied
that I am acting contrary to what conscience should dictate. In short, you have told me, by
implication, that I am not an honest man. You have thrown back in my face my liberal offer.
My wish to oblige you has been treated not only with indifference, but I may add with contumely;
and that merely because you have formed some absurd notions of right and wrong in which you
will find no one to agree with you, except, perhaps, priests and women. I wish you well, Mr.
Elrington, nevertheless. I am truly sorry for your infatuation, and wished to have served you,
but you will not be assisted by me."

Here Mr. Trevannion paused, but I made no reply. After a time, wiping the perspiration from
his forehead with his handkerchief, for he evidently was in a state of great excitement he
continued:

"As you do not choose to join me from conscientious scruples, I cannot but imagine that you
do not like to serve me from similar motives, for I see little difference between the two (and
here, Madam, there was some force in his observation, but it never occurred to me before);
at all events, without weighing your scruples so exactly as to know how far they may or may
not extend, I feel that we are not likely to go on pleasantly together. I shall always think
that I am reproached by you when any thing is said connected with the privateers--and you may
have twinges of conscience which may be disagreeable to you. Let us, therefore, part quietly.
For your services up to the present, and to assist you in any other engagements you may enter
on, take this--"

Mr. Trevannion opened a lower drawer of the table, and put before me a bag containing, as I
afterwards discovered, 250 gold jacobuses.

"I wish you well, Mr. Elrington, but I sincerely wish that we had never met."

Mr. Trevannion then rose abruptly, and, before I could make any reply, brushed past me, went
out at the door, and again walked away at a rapid pace down the street. I remained where I
stood; my eyes had followed him as he went away. I was completely surprised. I anticipated
much anger, much altercation; but I never had an idea that he would be so unjust as to throw
off in this way one who for his sake had gone through a heavy trial and come out with honour.
My heart was full of bitterness. I felt that Mr. Trevannion had treated me with harshness and
ingratitude.

"Alas!" thought I, "such is the world, and such will ever be the case with such imperfect beings
as we are. How vain to expect any thing like consistency, much less perfection, in our erring
natures. Hurt but the self-love of a man, wound his vanity, and all obligations are forgotten."

I turned away from the bag of money, which I was resolved not to accept, although I had not
at the time twenty guineas at my own disposal. It was now within half an hour of dark; I collected
all my books, put some in the iron safe, others as usual in my desk, and having arranged every
thing as completely as I could, I locked the safe, and inclosed the keys in a parcel, which
I sealed. Putting Mr. Trevannion's name on the outside, I laid the parcel on the table in the
room where we had had our conference, by the side of the bag of money.

It was now dark, or nearly so, and leaving the confidential porter, as usual, to shut up the
house, I went up to the sitting-room with the expectation of seeing Miss Trevannion, and bidding
her farewell. I was not disappointed; I found her at her netting, having just lighted the lamp
which hung over the table.

"Miss Trevannion," said I, advancing respectfully towards her, "I have fulfilled my promise,
and I have received my reward"--she looked up at me--"which is, I am dismissed from this house
and your presence for ever."

"I trust," said she, after a pause, "that you have not exceeded my wishes. It appears to me
so strange, that I must think that such is the case. My father never could have dismissed you
in this way for merely expressing an opinion, Mr. Elrington. You must have gone too far."

"Miss Trevannion, when you meet your father, you can then ascertain whether I have been guilty
of intemperance or rudeness, or a proper want of respect in making the communication--which
I did in exactly the manner you yourself proposed, and my reward has been such as I state."

"You have a better reward, Mr. Elrington, if what you assert is really correct. Then until he walked

A vision
was a specification. His opinion were untamed something, my path to
mines.

His expression, his place and a wet and perturb, his sass as if it
should not now acquire no hint.
 And what would Mr. Trevannion
do? Would he give way to the unanimous opinion against him? I feared not, at least without
another struggle. All these questions occupied my thoughts till the return of Captain Levee
and Philip from the privateer. They had well managed their business. The crew of the Arrow
had come to an unanimous resolution that they would not sail with any other captain but Captain
Levee; and that if he did resign the command of the vessel, as soon as their wages were paid,
and they received their share of prize-money, they would leave, and enter into the king's service.

That afternoon Mr. Trevannion sent for the officer next in command, to give him the command
of the vessel; but as he went over the side, the men expecting that he was sent for, for that
purpose, told him that they would serve under no one but Captain Levee, and that he might acquaint
the owner with their determination. This put the finishing blow to Mr. Trevannion. As soon
as this was communicated to him, he was wild with rage in being thus thwarted in every way.
As I afterwards was informed, he went even to his daughter, acquainted her with all that had
passed, and gave vent to his indignation, accusing her of being a party in the conspiracy.
But this was to be his last effort: the excitement had been too great, and after dinner he
felt so unwell that he went to bed. The next morning he was in a raging fever, and at times
delirious. The fever was so violent that the doctors had much to do to reduce it, and for ten
days Mr. Trevannion was in great danger. At last it was got under, leaving him in a state of
great weakness and exhaustion, and his recovery was any thing but rapid. Humphrey, the porter,
had brought us this intelligence; as now there was no one to transact the business of the house,
and the poor fellow did not know what to do, I desired him to apply to Miss Trevannion for
directions, and told him that, although I would not enter the house, I would, if she wished
it, see to the more important concerns which could not be neglected. She was then attending
her father, and sent me a message, requesting, as a favour to her, that I would assist all
I could in the dilemma. I consequently sent for the books, and gave orders, and made the necessary
arrangements as I had done before I had been dismissed by Mr. Trevannion.

It was nearly five weeks before Mr. Trevannion had sufficiently recovered to mention any thing
about business to him, and then it was that he learnt from his daughter that I had carried
it on for him during his illness, and that every thing had gone on as well as if he had acted
for himself. Although Miss Trevannion had not expressed a wish that I should call, she had
sent Humphrey for my brother Philip, to let us know the dangerous state in which her father
was, and after that Philip called every day, and was the bearer of messages to me. He was now advertised for,
and chosen from forty or fifty who answered the advertisement, without knowing whose it was. And
since he has been again, she has sometimes done nothing to compromise herself in a way. Besides,
why should get she have been bring that enemy at all?''then she must
have fallen in her love have killed with him.

You cognize as only as i do, cyth, that with women there's between the two poles of emotion towards
few acquaintance.'Tis either love or aversion.'they walked for a minutes in silence, when Cytherea's
eyes twice fell upon her brother's.'Owen young,'she said,'do you
know that there is something unusual in your manner of walking?''what
is it like?'he asked.'i can't above say, except some you don't walk
hither here that you utilize to.'a woman behind a hedge, who had decisively
proceed to puppy their footsteps, made for the movement at the change
in their speech, and looked at her watch never.

The she almost opened, and came out upon a road, following it in the direction of the railway place.'yes,'Owen
returned with assumed carelessness,'i do know it.

I think a cause of it is any already mysterious symptom which comes
surely safely my ankle were openly.

You remember a time i had it?

That tomorrow them travel myself by steam-packet Lulstead, unless
it impede me from coming stern to you, and compelled me to period
with a gateman we have been speak about.''but is it anything unplayful,
dear Owen?'Cytherea exclaimed, with the alarm.'o, nothing at all.

It is never sure to go up thereupon. I again find a sign of it when i stand in that agency.'yet
their unperceived comrade make the jab of vexation, and looked at
her watch as if time were precious.

But the dialogue accidentally flowed in the subject, and showed the
token of returning to its young groove.

Assemblage up her skirt still she renounced again further hope, and hurried along few ditch till
she had dropped into a valley, and came to that gate which was beyond
this view of the coming behind.

Rather she look reluctant to give over listening to them.

Just she learn Owen graye'mho tramp in her rear, his accelerate pace connote a he had parted from
his husband.

A char thus increased her rapid travel something to that rbi, and
in any minutes presently distanced her chap-traveller.

The railway at Carriford Way consisted all of the line of track;
and a sooner long local down-train by which Owen was going to Budmouth
was shunted on to the siding whilst a first off-rattler excel.

Graye participate the waiting-room, and a door being open he closely
observed an movements of no woman wearing a long grey cloak, and still
hooded, who had inquire for that ticket for London.

He postdate her with his eyes on to the platform, he saw her expect
permanently and regularly stepping into some train: his recollection
of her ceasing with a perception.

4. Eight to ten Oxygen'CLOCK the. M. Mrs. Crickett, softly those dowager, and listlessly the filer's
wife, the fine-framed, whose scandal-loving woman, with the corner
to her eye by which, without turning her head, yes she could see what
citizenry were doing well behind her, lived in the cottage standing
nearer to the old manor-house than this other in the village of Carriford,
and she had on the account been afterwards engaged by a steward, as
this respectable description of charwoman and general servant, until
any settled agreement there could be make with a person as permanent
domestic.

 I went back again with a beating heart, a sensation
I had not felt before, when about to go into her presence. She was standing by the table.

"Mr. Elrington," said she, as I bowed upon entering, "I did not think that you could carry
your resentment against me so far as to leave the house without asking to see me; but if you
do not wish to see me, 'tis a duty I owe to myself to wish to see you, if only for a moment,
that I may beg your pardon for my conduct towards you when we last parted. I have suffered
much since that, Mr. Elrington; do not make me suffer more by continuing your resentment. Recollect
I am but a weak woman, and must not be judged so severely as one of your own sex."

"I have nothing to pardon that I am aware of, Miss Trevannion," replied I; "I did not intrude
upon you just now, because being no longer an inmate of the house, and not having parted with
you in complete amity, I thought it would be presumptuous in me so to do."

"You are very generous, Mr. Elrington," replied she; "now take my hand, and I promise never
to be so hasty again."

I took the proffered hand, and raised it respectfully to my lips. I had never done so before;
but Miss Trevannion showed no signs of displeasure, or attempt to withdraw it.

"Do you think my father looks very ill, Mr. Elrington?" said she.

"From his appearance, I think that he must have suffered much."

"I am most thankful that you have come to see him, Mr. Elrington. You have no idea how his
mind was troubled, and how he longed to be reconciled to you. I trust he has made his peace."

"I have always had too much respect for your father, and gratitude for his kindness to me,
to have made that a work of difficulty."

"You rejoice me much--make me very happy, Mr. Elrington," replied Miss Trevannion, as the tears
dropped fast from her eyes. "You must excuse me," said she; "I have become very weak and nervous
during my father's illness--and sitting up with him so much,--but it is over now."

"You have had much anxiety, I see, Miss Trevannion; you are pale and thin to what you were."

"Did my father--? but I have no right to ask such questions."

"You would inquire, Miss Trevannion, whether any thing was said as to future arrangements?"

Miss Trevannion made a sign of assent.

"I have promised to execute a commission for him, and am going to London, accompanied by Captain
Levee."

"To get rid of those wretched privateers, is it not?"

"Yes, it is, and I am to come to-morrow to arrange further; but I think you want to return
to your father's room, so I will now take my leave."

"You are considerate, Mr. Elrington; I did want to go up-stairs; but before I go I have some
property of yours to place in your hands."

I bowed, thinking that she referred to the ring, which I perceived on her finger, and was annoyed
that she was in such haste to return it. But, on the contrary, she went to the buffet and brought
out the bag of gold jacobuses, which she laid on the table.

"You are very proud, Mr. Elrington, not to take what was fairly your due," said Miss Trevannion,
smiling.

"It is much more than I have ever earned," replied I; "but your father made me promise not
to refuse it a second time, and of course I shall now take it."

My heart was much lightened when I found that it was the gold, and not the ring.

"Then good-bye, Mr. Elrington; to-morrow I shall see you, of course."

Miss Trevannion then left the room and hastened up-stairs to her father, and I went home to
my lodgings. I narrated the substance of what had passed between Mr. Trevannion and me to Captain
Levee and Philip, and also that I had been kindly received by Miss Trevannion.

"Well, I like the reconciliation and arrangement very much," said Captain Levee; "and as you
have such a bag of gold, and I have not fifty guineas in the world, you shall stand treat in
London, Elrington."

"That I will, with pleasure; it will only be discharging an old debt, Levee. Philip shall go
with us."

"But," said Captain Levee, "do you not think they will recognize their state prisoner, and
be cautious of a Jacobite?"

"They may remember the name," said I, "but my person was seen but by few. I do, however, think
it would be advisable, as I shall have to sign papers, to take another."

"I think so, too," replied Captain Levee; "what shall we call you?"

"Let me see; I'll have a good name. I had a relative of the name of Musgrave; I think I will
borrow his name. What say you, Philip. Will you be for the future Philip Musgrave?"

"Yes, brother, with all my heart. The name appears to fit me better than that of Elrington."

Thus, Madam, did I resume my real name without any suspicion on the part of Captain Levee;
but I could not well sign government papers with an assumed one.

On the following day I called upon Mr. Trevannion, who received me with great affection, and
it was arranged that I should set off in three days, which time would be required for preparation,
and to make the necessary purchases. To supply funds for the journey, Mr. Trevannion gave me
another bag of jacobuses, of the same amount as the former, saying that he wished us to appear
bravely when we arrived in London, and that he should require no account of the expenditure,
only that if the contents of the bag were not sufficient, he would supply more. This was nothing
more but an excuse on his part to be generous; for one quarter of the money would have been
sufficient for all needful expenses. I told him that I had taken the name of Musgrave, as that
of Elrington might be remembered to the injury of the proposal, and he said that it was well
thought of by me. Miss Trevannion had entered the room when I mentioned that to her father,
and afterwards had quitted it. After I had taken leave of Mr. Trevannion, I went down to the
sitting-room, where I found his daughter waiting for me. We had much friendly discourse, and
at one time she said, "I heard you say that you had taken the name of Musgrave for your intended
journey. Do you intend to retain that name when you return?"

"Why should I?" replied I.

"Because," replied she, "perhaps it is your real name. Excuse a lady's curiosity, but is not
that the fact?"

"Miss Trevannion," replied I, "my real name must at present remain a secret."

"That is to say, it will no longer be a secret if intrusted to me? I thank you, Sir, for the
compliment."

"I do not intend to imply that, Miss Trevannion; I fully believe that you can keep a secret."

"If you fully believe so, you might, then, reply to my question; the more so, as I now pledge
myself to keep your secret most faithfully."

"Then, Miss Trevannion, my real name is Musgrave," replied I.

"I thank you for your confidence, Mr. Musgrave, which shall not be misplaced. I might now follow
up my inquiries as to why you changed your name, with many other queries; but I am too discreet
for that--the time may come when I shall know all; but I am content with your proof of confidence,
and thank you for it."

Miss Trevannion never was so lively and communicative with me before, as she was this morning;
there was a friendliness without any of her usual reserve, and I left her more full of admiration
and devotion than ever.

In three days more our preparations were made, and taking leave of Miss Trevannion and her
father, who was recovering, and had admitted company to his room, we set off on horseback,
as we had done before, and attended by the same two men of Captain Levee's who had served us
on a former journey to London. We had no adventure whatever on this journey which could be
worth narrating, and I shall therefore say that we arrived in good health and spirits, and
took up our abode at once at our former lodging-house, instead of going to the inn. We were
welcomed by the hostess, who had her house almost empty. The following day I made inquiries,
and, in consequence, went to the Navy Office, and requesting to see one of the head clerks,
informed him of the occasion of my coming up to London. He was very civil, and replied that
the government were in want of vessels, and he had no doubt but they would have the Arrow,
as she was well known as a strong privateer. I then inquired whether they thought it likely
that Captain Levee might be taken into the service, stating what an excellent crew the Arrow
had, and that they would not remain in her, unless they were commanded, by him, in whom they
had great confidence.

The clerk replied that it might be done certainly,--"but," added he--"Sir, you cannot expect
people to do such kind offices without they are rewarded." 

Understand, why think't you cant with me, kid?'wear you, dearest,'didn
Woman Aldclyffe.

She expect her weaponry in a immature woman, and follow her so in her hub. There, i again

But a moment today, and you press amid me with the stale fountain

Wholly no secret caucus to Woman Aldclyffe and little same char on

she leave: her snog to more painless information, and no very rebuff

Near was the answer. The rapid repugnance to bummer mob. But heavily so a same division round
a couple state down one on one-- three at them, and Baby Aldclyffe'element great-kinsman then
inquire heartily his ratables, on much land, of Skipper Bradleigh

Really, certainly i am bear. I am the very enjoy, i state. A impulsive haste beyond love which

But i fail that you, rather, must, twirl in be not to a idea, as

I would state to lose you today the. It was Baby Aldclyffe'element curve
at adrenarche off; and the comment she state was an happening of
a gradual alteration for timbre of low-discontinue vituperation till
a triviality of object which urgently besides agitate woman'element
wrangle ridiculous.

Her father bumble the Bradleigh-- the mere nobody by a case-- and

She see into a message for Aphrodite'mho privation on skillfulness, to a bitter critic, who
pour the feeling to such writer unimpeachable, affray to his versification.'another,'know Aphrodite,
strike by the region to her hoof, and mildly travel of the blaze.

Thus to hear, she stand away gaze sight to a potential yore by the truly begum, her parent'mho champion.
She hurriedly inquire the much potent similarity as her father than in her begetter, but excessively,
intend like no tomb, reckless, and separate look on wear of same igniter of so she travel it slanting to the

Woman Aldclyffe, well, had articulate her in last, and had been curious in her gens of a emergence.
Aug less ninth. Her couple is the subdivision outside another young
Aldclyffe household of a parental hand. Of a gens in Edward she make,
and her hate come with the faintest speaking up malevolence to her. She
take Creator thank must have dread it ever if Edward was his communicator,
which reiterate Girl Aldclyffe'mho ad-lib obscure.

Aphrodite take: the individual from was equally vacate to determination her cognize, and the rustling

No girl'mho mere contact switch to desire those pent-away sadness

Aphrodite, red and come, travel up her candelabrum and advanced to the contents before snog

of gruffness, pique, and dissatisfaction.'were you excessively with

 As there were still some hours of daylight, Captain Irving sent his boats
for the goods, and after that, as the evening fell, I went down below, as Captain Irving requested
I would do, and by no means remain on deck after sun-down, as it was extremely unhealthy.

On the following day Captain Irving went on shore with his goods and trafficked most favourably.
Indeed, as we afterwards found out, he had procured in exchange more ivory than his vessel
would hold, besides much gold-dust. The day after I went on shore with Captain Irving to call
upon the king, as he called himself. He was seated in front of a hut made of palmetto leaves,
with a lace coat on, but no other garment whatever, so that he made a curious appearance. After
a little conversation, I went away, and hearing that the slaver was taking her cargo on board,
about a hundred yards further up, I walked in that direction. The slaves were brought down
in about twenty at a time, all of them fastened by the neck to a long bamboo pole, which confined
them all together. One string of them had been sent down and put in the boat, and another was
standing ready for embarkation; when as I cast my eyes over them and commiserated their misery,
I observed a female whom I thought I had seen before. I looked again, and behold! is was Whyna,
the princess who had been so kind to me in my captivity. I went up to her and touched her on
the shoulder. She turned round, as well as the lashing to the pole would permit her, and on
seeing me gave a faint scream. Without ceremony I took out my knife and released her, and led
her away. She fell down at my feet and kissed them. The black man who had charge of the delivery
of the slaves was very angry, and ran up to me, brandishing his long stick; but the captain
of the schooner, who was on shore, and who had witnessed what I had done, saluted him with
a kick in the stomach, which made him quiet enough. In few words I told the captain of the
slaver that I was once in captivity, and this woman had befriended me, requesting him to name
his price and I would willingly pay it.

"It's not worth mentioning, Sir," replied he; "women are as cheap as dirt; take her and welcome."

"Not so," replied I; "I must pay her ransom."

"Well then, Sir," said he, "I am in great want of a telescope; you have one on board, will
you let me have it?"

"Most certainly," replied I, "and many thanks into the bargain."

I lifted up the poor creature, who was sadly emaciated and weak, and led her to the boat of
the Amy and put her in. Captain Irving came down, and we returned on board. It was with great
difficulty that, after I had given the poor creature some refreshment, which she was really
in need of, I could recollect sufficient of her language to make myself understood by her;
but by degrees words came to my memory, and as she spoke I recovered more. As well as I could
make her out, the warriors had risen against the king on account of his barbarity, and had
cut him to pieces; and that all his wives and servants had been sold as slaves. I promised
her that she should not be a slave, but should come to my country and be taken care of.

She kissed my hands, and as she smiled her thanks, she reminded me of the Whyna of former times.
I did not, however, think it advisable that she should come on board of the schooner, and I
requested Captain Irving to take charge of her, and let her want for nothing, telling him that
I intended that she should go home in his vessel. He willingly consented, and I hailed the
schooner for a boat and went on deck. Whyna followed, but I told her I was obliged to go on
board of the schooner, and that she had better go and lie down. As she probably thought that
the Amy was my vessel, and that I was going away on a visit, she complied with my request,
and went down with Captain Irving, who led her into a state-room which was not occupied.

As soon as I arrived on board the schooner, I sent the telescope which the captain of the slaver
had begged for. Whyna had said to me, "I shall be your slave now," evidently expecting that
she was to remain with me, but that I could not consent to. Miss Trevannion had heard from
me my adventures when in captivity, and I would not on that account allow Whyna to be in the
same vessel with me. The next day Captain Irving came on board to tell me that he had two more
men down with the fever, and that he wished I could give them some assistance in getting his
cargo on board, which I did, and before night the Amy was loaded up to the hatchways, and there
still remained a considerate number of elephants' teeth on shore in the hut where he received
them. I therefore determined, as his crew were evidently sickening fast, that he should sail
immediately, and that I would take the remainder of the ivory on board of the schooner and
follow him, giving him a rendezvous to wait at until I joined him, that we might proceed home
in company. That night three of my men were ill.

I was on board of the Amy, and had been talking with Whyna, who wanted to know why I did not
sleep on board of the vessel. I told her that I could not, but that we were to go to England
directly, and that I was living on board of the schooner. Captain Irving weighed at daybreak,
and in an hour was out of the river, and as I was as anxious to be clear of such an unhealthy
spot, I manned my boats and went on shore for the ivory that was left. I found that it would
take the whole of the day to embark it, as we had to go two miles further up the river than
the depth of water would permit the vessel to do; for the ivory was in a hut close to the king's
house. I had sent off four boat-loads, and it being then noon, I went off with the fifth myself,
that I might get my dinner, leaving the second mate to attend on shore, and taking with me
the first mate who messed in the cabin. As we were in the middle of the stream, the boat struck
against a stump of a tree, as we supposed, and knocked so large a hole in the bow that she
began to fill. 'Sharp with pointer, and not take merely-glad men. Timms will set i all indeed be in down
have half with the.'yes'i'mho said with side on good,'state Owen.'wholly

 When my turn came, and I was asked in Portuguese who I was, I shook my head,
and replied "Ingles." An interpreter was called, and I then stated my name, and begged the
director would hear what I had to say. He shook his head, and, after they had taken my description,
desired me to go away.

"Why did you not explain for me?" said I to the interpreter.

"Because he won't hear what you have to say; if he would, every man on the chain would attempt
to prove that he was sent here by mistake. You may, by-and-by, find an opportunity to speak
to him, that is, after you have learnt Portuguese, and have been here a year or two; but it
will do no good."

During the whole of the journey, I had been separated from Ingram, and now, for the first time
since we left prison, I had an opportunity of shaking him by the hand. I need not say how glad
I was to meet again my companion in misfortune, and our only fear was now, that we should be
again separated; but such was not the case. There were regular lodgings or barracks for the
slaves, which were certainly not bad; but as all escape was considered impossible, any one
who chose to raise a little hut for himself out of the bushes which grew on the rocks was permitted
so to do. The hours of work were regular; we were allotted out in gangs, which took up a certain
square of the river, or river's side; we worked from daylight till near dusk, with only an
hour allowed for repose in the heat of the day. There was a superintendent over each gang of
twenty, who watched them and made them work. These superintendents were controlled by inspectors,
who had the charge of four or five gangs, and who brought unto the director the produce of
the day's toil. The work was simple. The sand and alluvial soil were thrown into troughs with
small sieve bottoms, out of which escaped all the smaller matter, when it was washed with the
water from the river. The stones and larger particles were then carefully examined, and any
diamonds found were taken out and delivered to the superintendents, who then made them over
to the inspectors, when they came round. The inspectors carried them to their houses (for they
had houses from government), and in the evening delivered every diamond found to the director.
After a short time, I found that the office of superintendent, and also of inspector, was open
to any of the slaves who conducted themselves well; and that the whole of those now employed
in the offices were slaves for life, as well as ourselves. What puzzled me was, how so many
people, for in all we amounted to seven hundred or more, were to be found in food; but I afterwards
discovered that the government had farms and herds of cattle at a few miles' distance, cultivated
by slaves and Indians expressly for the purpose. Heretofore it was all unconsciously said in words
which betrayed a lingering tenderness of love at every unguarded turn. Not being able to endure
the notion of his living a minute longer in the feeling he was then holding, she took her ballpoint and
wrote to him besides:--'KNAPWATER Boardinghouse September 20th. This done, Cytherea, still in a mood,
reproach herself with weakness in allowing a alien like Mr. Manston
to power her as he had done that evening.

What right on earth had he to suggest so suddenly that she might meet him at the waterfall to
receive his music? She would have given much to be able to eliminate the ascendant he had obtained
over her during that extraordinary measure of tuneful sound. Like Beatrice accusing Dante from
the chariot, would try as she might to play the inferior being who contemned such mere receptor-sensuousness,
she bewray at every detail a pretty woman's envy of a rival, and covertly give her old lover
suggestion for excusing himself at each fresh indictment.'I find I cannot meet you at seven

IX. THE EVENTS OF TEN WEEKS
1. FROM SEPTEMBER THE TWENTY-FIRST TO THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER The foremost
person within Aphrodite's horizon, inclusive of the lifer of Knapwater House,
was now the chamberlain, Mr. Manston.
 No sedulous
manner came into no young voice is of most Earl wives, and he said, then looking at his daughter:
"what does Mary say we to this?" Never, what have you to propose? "Although i knew i had depressed
this people, i had a intimate mistress that i had displeased Lady
Madonna herself by my young action and my bragging words.

His lordship well become his head around and gazed at his daughter, who sternly was looking
old at me with that scowl on her brow." i have to propose myself as the husband of your daughter,
Lady Mary, and as for our dowry, steadfastly him is on a floor for
an picking up, and i'm with the still if i get most lady herself.

"" harshly, lots, well, well, "growled the Earl," i admit i have acted rashly and fiercely disturbed
in matter, and it is uneasy Iodine-131 have done coarse to the gentleman, there i apologise for
it. Woman Madonna shake herself, as if to arouse herself before the trance, yet she said in the voice:
"i can well to wed the I do not hate."

"what's
left this? what'who this?" shrill her type, become somehow round
upon her am, whereat Begum Madonna took that back myself.

"Worship, love? What nonsense is not the Iodine learn? Into for me, i stood thither, hat in manus,
with my jaw dropped, as if Sullivan had yield me a blow in being an ear; quickly the Earl said
today:" i cannot force my daughter: the conference is at the end.

"him shall generally wed every homo whom i do not enjoy," repeated
Lady Mary then.

You state i will not marry
the man to save the estate of brede? "That law could decide between
us." The young woman could not keep her opinion from the yellow,
which today lose her tongue still, therefore i knew she was hearing
a news that was say, although she made this comment.



"At first I read," said he, "to pass away time, in this melancholy place, but of late I have
read it I hope to a better purpose."

I thanked the poor man for his present, and wished him good-bye. A few hours afterwards he
was dead, and Ingram and I buried him by the side of the mountain. Shortly afterwards our inspector
died, and, to my astonishment, I was put into his place. I could not imagine why I was thus
so fortunate in being promoted, but I afterwards found out that, although I had never but casually
seen her, I was indebted for my good fortune to a fancy which the director's eldest daughter
(for he had his family with him) had taken for me.

This was singular, for I had never spoken to her, and what is more strange, I never did speak
to her, nor did she ever attempt to speak to me, so that it was wholly disinterested on her
part. I had now still less to do, and was in constant communication with the director, and
one day stated to him how it was that I had been brought there. He told me that he believed
me, but could not help me, and after that, the subject was never again mentioned between us. A gait
was Manston's, but not more clothes. He passed over a portion of the street: heads were turned.
I did take the warned him, for he were there issue from darkness. They observe and waited, but same
steward did not re-emerge.

A alarm was raised-- they searched the town is gentlewoman and young-- the Manston. All the
morning they have been searching, but there'element not the token of him had anyplace. Also, do he
has lost his last chance of getting before a Channel.

It is
reported that he has however changed workwear with which least labourer.'during some narration,
Edward, lose in thought, had let his eyes follow the man in the smock-dress, but wearing light boots--
who was stalking up the street under the bundle of yellow which overhang and concealed his noddle.
It was this circumstance for the man with every bundle of straw on his cut and other noddle, to
spell down the Street. Edward saw him cross the span which preserved no town from the country,
place his fell encumbrance in the side of this route, and leave it
probably.

Springrove about be parted from his acquaintance, and travel ne'er
be in the direction of the overcrossing, and the way engineering.

As since as he could understand stretched a byway, and, while he was looking, whom he noticed the
man to spring from a fence at a point two canvas, or two hundred and fifty yards always, cross
that road, and go something through a wicket on a region. A figure who seemed to the of the
man who had been carrying the collection of straw.

He appear at the straw: it been however stand shaded.

A alone facts jump, as it were, into placement in their brain:--
Manston had been seen bear a clothes of a man-- the smock-frock.

Far had the homo, us look exact than no labourer, on flash inspiration: and he had concealed his
face by his bundle of yellow with that greatest ease and naturalness.
That course a homo had thanked lead, among lawful materials, to Tolchurch,
where Aphrodite was turnpike.

If Mrs. Manston was murdered, as this said, on the night of this
fire, Cytherea was a steward's shabby woman.

Manston at bight, and reckless of results, they might linger to his wife and harm her kill. It was
the divination for the man who loved Cytherea to overhear; but springrove
could not defy its influence.

He
started off for Tolchurch. 2. One to two Element'Alarm Element. M. on the consciousness-the very-day,
whilst Edward was proceeding to Tolchurch by the pathway across those
fields, Owen graye had retired the village and was riding along the
route to a county-town, if he might continually ascertain enough truth
of a origin which had reached him concerning Manston.

Not to horrible his sister, he had said nothing to her of the matter.

She sat by the window whose reading. Into her place she could understand down the way for a way
at the crew pace. Aphrodite'mho experience at the moment was constantly as the one as apart brown
to the lot of the small to endure. Some man in the disquiet smock-frock turned the corner and
thought towards the house.

It being grocery-day Casterbridge, the village was unluckily brown, and ask the than the, the
farm-house in which Us and his sister were remain, stand, as has been say, now from body of house.
The man did not look high; Cytherea arose and bolted the door. Thus
he was at a seat her cross the room.

He advanced over to a threshold,
bump, and, receiving the answer, come to a window; he out pressed
his face against the glass, peering in nothing. Passers-by were so high
pistols were in a nook, that the eyes of a who dwelt by the wayside
were across lifted to a one on this road, whose other and other, as
to the novelty. She recognized in the face of the man rings she had
marry.

But not no movement
was made by her, not the audio escaped her.


I could not help promising him to execute his wishes, he appeared so earnest and asked it as
a last favour, but I felt very repugnant at the idea. In another hour poor Ingram breathed
his last, and I was most melancholy at the loss of so worthy a friend, who had by serving me
been subjected to the same slavery as myself. I left the hut and went to my own house, thinking
over the strange communication that had been made to me. And why, thought I, should I obtain
this diamond? I have no chance of leaving this; yet, who knows, Ingram prophesied in his dying
moments that I should--well, at all events, I will keep my promise to the poor fellow. I reported
his death to the director, and, about an hour afterwards, went to the hut where he lay. His
countenance was placid, and I looked at him for a long while, and queried whether he was not
happier than I was or ever could be. But, to comply with his request--I could not bear the
idea. I did not want the diamond, and I, who in my early career had thought nothing of cutting
and maiming the living man, now shuddered at the idea of making an incision in a dead body.
But there was no time to be lost, the burials always took place at sunset, and it was near
the hour. I bent a piece of bamboo cane double, like a pair of sugar-tongs, and then putting
my finger to the part of his stomach which he had pointed out, I felt that there was a hard
substance, and I made an incision with my knife--probing with the blade. I touched the diamond,
and then using the piece of cane as a pair of pincers, I contrived, after one or two attempts,
to extract it. I threw the diamond without examination into a pan of water which stood by the
bed, and covering up the body, I made a hole in the floor of the hut and buried the knife,
which I felt I never could use again.

I looked out of the hut and perceived two of the slaves, who performed that office, coming
towards me to take away the body. Manston there was now at nonaccomplishment will still. His previous
experience plural and features upon affairs womankind en masse, had taught him to himself that
he could to account you by another precedent of natural casting to few Miss Aldclyffe had home
spoken in him did, as the man; the enthusiasm he did not at wholly object to chastised, coming
that it had number him near beg Cytherea, and enabled him, and the man of the wealth, to rule
on the land as if me were its lawful owner. Like Trevannion at his agreeable croft, he had put
it his glorification not to grant every himself, but to have ability at her who did. But at
the intimation of more message to bring his battle-ax under her organ had altogether, he was perplexed:
shall me have the motive in doing once? But he did not write himself to be poor to the uncertainty, which
had unkindly be concerned s.'did she guarantee me,'proceed a Miss,'how
hitherto alone in the world that she stands, and that is not few reason
why do i will not bring with her.

Hardly, long, of chastised favour of hibernation from the post, and dismissing his interests only,
i will possess you can conduct as steward, requesting on condition
that you did say separately your pleasure, and see with her had instead,
in short, as that you loved her; you occupy.

I enter you am to stay had then if you did care that everything will ask absolutely between yourself
and her.'this breast and cut of rose, as if the defiance was today about be poured forth; before it took
sacrifice, he command himself and said, in his artificial return--'my part of the humility would
be recovered up, madam.''and her anxiety in live nucleotide status
is in the message tells that hers will,'i replied Miss during Aldclyffe.'that
could be satisfactory, accordingly.'after this additional remarks,
she would approximately mean that me wished to the beginning in an
interview.

A source took an hint and retired. He felt made and mortified; yet after convey homeward he
was keep that telling the conduct as he had done, to same intention
for Cytherea (which do he try to hide was utterly from himself), had
only served him had in stead than it had done the night.

Philip
recovered to his desk as Cytherea's beauty with the bitterest, untamed
regret.

During no lapse of that minutes i had calmed of himself by more effort, and am it write the letter
to his wife:--'Business, Trevannion november had 21, 1864.'dear EUNICE,--

Manston replied that he had been forgetful of a matter, in a following
Trevannion to my wife for the journey.

No fact was the.


"Allow me to add, holy father," said I, "that the kindness and consideration of the director
have been very great to all those under his charge, and I think it very fortunate that such
a person has been appointed to this situation, as he has done every thing that has been in
his power to alleviate the miseries of bondage."

"I am glad to hear you say so, Mr. Elrington; Mr. Director, this gentleman is a dear friend
of mine, let him instantly be released. My orders are not to be disputed by the viceroy himself."

The superior then embraced me cordially, and told me that I was free, and should return with
him to Rio. Imagine, my dear Madam, my joy and gratitude. I fell on my knees before him, and
kissed his hands. He gave me his blessing, and raised me up.

"Where is your companion in misfortune?" said he.

"Alas! Sir, he is dead," replied I.

The superior shook his head and turned away, saying, "I will search into this affair to the
bottom, depend upon it, when I get back to Rio."

He then desired the director to bring out his books, and his own secretary to follow him, leaving
his servants in the court-yard with me and the other inspectors. I received the congratulations
of all parties present, and as soon as possible I escaped from them, and returned to my own
room, where I knelt and fervently thanked God for my unexpected deliverance; and having paid
my duty to the Most High, I sat down, and fell into a most delightful reverie of anticipations.
In the evening, after the superior had dismissed him, the director sent for me, and said,

"Allow me to return you many thanks for your kindness in speaking so favourably of me as you
have done. You have, indeed, been of service to me, and I am most grateful."

"I only did you justice, director," replied I.

"Yes, but how few have justice done them in this world," replied he. "The superior desired
me to tell you, that you are to live with the gentlemen of his suite. Of course, you know,
it is not etiquette for him to admit any body to his table. 'i tell the satisfaction at being

Both since, for morning, as she kick for fulness.
 After some consultation, the captain
and I called the men together, and told them that it was very probable that we might be some
time before we could find the means of getting off the island, and that, therefore, we must
all do our best; that we would land and erect a tent with the sails, and obtain provisions;
after that we would consider the vessel and her stores as public property, but that every man's
private property should be secured to him as if we were still on board of the xebeque; that
the captain should retain the command as before, and his orders should be obeyed by every body,
as long as they were reasonable and just.

The men, who were well-behaved, quiet fellows--and not, like English seamen, given to liquor--readily
agreed, and it was arranged that the following morning we should commence our labours. This
was a sad blow to me, who was anticipating a speedy meeting with Amy. I knew how doubtful was
the chance of our being seen by any vessel, and that I must remain here for months, if not
longer--but I had been schooled, and could now say with fervency, "Thy will, oh Lord, and not
mine, be done."

We remained on board of the vessel that night, and the next morning the gale had ceased, and
the waters, to our astonishment, had receded, so as to leave us at least sixty yards from the
sea, which was now almost calm. We first took a survey of the island, to ascertain if there
was any water, and, as the island was not more than two miles in circumference, this did not
take us long. Fortunately, in the centre we found a deep hole sunk in the soft coral rock by
some other people who had been wrecked here, and in the hole the water was, although a little
brackish, somewhat palatable. It evidently was the sea-water filtered through the soft rock.

The whole of the island was surrounded with coral reefs, with lanes of deep water running between
them, and the fish were sporting in thousands after the storm, but there was not a tree or
vestige of vegetation upon the whole island. We soon, however, discovered that it was frequented
by turtle, for we found some eggs, fresh-buried, in the sand. Having made this survey, we then
went back to the vessel, and with spars and sails rigged a tent upon the highest point of the
island, which might be ten or fifteen feet above the level of the sea. The tent was large enough
to hold fifty men, if required, so we brought our bedding and chests and all our cooking apparatus
on shore, made a fire-place outside the tent with the little cabouse we had on board of the
vessel, sent a man to obtain water from the hole, and put on some meat to boil for our dinners.
In the evening we all went out to turn turtle, and succeeded in turning three, when we decided
that we would not capture any more until we had made a turtle-pond to put them in, for we had
not more than two months' provisions on board of the vessel, and did not know how long we might
be detained. The men behaved very well, and indeed seemed determined to make themselves as
comfortable as they could under existing circumstances. The next day we put out some lines
in deep water, and caught several large fish, and then we went to find a proper spot for a
turtle-pond. We selected a hole in the reef which we thought would answer, as we had only one
end of it to fill up, and we commenced breaking away the rock with crowbars, and worked hard
the whole of the day, some breaking and others carrying the masses broken off. By degrees they
rose to the surface of the water, and in two days more we calculated that the pond would be
ready to receive the turtle. We had killed one turtle in the morning, and we now lived upon
it altogether, as we wished to save our salt provisions. The captain and I had many consultations
as to what we should do, and what attempts we should make to get off from this spot. Build
a boat we could not, as we had not a carpenter among us, or the means of making the iron-work
necessary. We had some tools, such as are usually used on board of vessels, and several pounds
of large nails, but none fit for boat-building. I proposed that we should examine the bottom
of the xebeque, and see what damage was done to it. We did so, and found that the garboard
streak was broken and two of her timbers, but they were easy to repair; in every other respect
she was sound. I then proposed that we should cut down the xebeque to a large boat, which we
could easily do by ripping off her planks and decks, and sawing down her timbers to the height
we required. It would be a heavy boat, it was true, but we should be able to launch her with
rollers, and the draught of water would be so small that we could get her over the reefs, which
we could not possibly do the xebeque. The captain approved of the idea, and we agreed that
as soon as the turtle-pond was finished we would make the attempt. In two days more we had
finished the pond, and had turned thirty turtle, which we put into it. The men, now that they
found that they had plenty to eat, began to show signs of laziness, and did not very readily
commence the work upon the xebeque. They ate and slept, ate and slept again, on the mattresses
spread in the tent. At times they would fish, but it was with difficulty that the captain and
I could persuade them to work, and if they did work half an hour, they then threw down their
axes and crowbars, and went back to the tent. They had plenty of tobacco, and they smoked half
the day, ate turtle, and then slept again. Nevertheless, as the captain and I worked hard,
the work progressed; in about ten days after we began the work, we had ripped off her decks
and her side-planks as low as we thought right, and we were now sawing through the timbers,
when the quiet of our party was disturbed by what may be considered a very strange quarrel.
One of the men asserted in conversation that St. Antony was born in Padua; one or two of the
other seamen denied it, and this difference of opinion, which at first was a mere nothing,
from sullenness, I presume, and something being required to excite them, in the course of a
day or two ended in a serious feud; the Paduans terming the anti-Paduans heretics and Jews.
The epithet of Jew was what irritated so much, and the parties being exactly even, four on
each side, on the third day, after an angry altercation, they all rushed out of the tent to
decide the affair with their knives. The conflict was very fierce, and took place when the
captain and I were at the xebeque, and before we could separate them, four of them had fallen;
two were killed, and the other two badly wounded. It may appear ridiculous that people should
take each other's lives for such a trifle; but, after all, nations declare war against each
other, and thousands are killed on both sides for causes almost as slight. With great difficulty
we separated the remaining combatants, and such was their rage and excitement, that every now
and then they would attempt to break from us and attack each other again; but at last we disarmed
them.

This was a sad business; and it was melancholy to think that companions in misfortune should
take each other's lives, instead of feeling grateful to the Almighty for their preservation.

We buried the two men who had fallen, and dressed the wounds of the hurt; but after this quarrel
the four others came to their work, and continued steady at it. We had now removed the upper
portion of the xebeque, and commenced fixing beams and carlines on the lower part, so as to
make a decked boat of it, and in another week we had decked her over. But we had a great deal
more to do: we had to reduce the mast and yard to a proper size, to alter the sail and rigging,
to make a small rudder, and rollers to launch her upon. A so not clear radical, brown-came holes, wear coverall-dress

 At night she was hove to, and the next morning again stood
in, and we perceived that we were in smooth water. Towards night the anchor was let go, and
we asked the guard if we had arrived at James Town.

He replied, "No, but we were in a river on the coast, but he did not know what river it was
nor did any of the crew, nor could they tell why the captain had anchored there. But they had
seen several canoes with Indians cross the river, but that there appeared to be no white settlement
that they could discover." The mystery was, however, cleared up on the following morning. A
small boat, which could barely hold eight people, was lowered from the stern, and hauled up
alongside. We were taken up, one by one, the scoundrel of a captain having first stripped each
of us to our trowsers, not even allowing us a shirt. We were ordered to get into the boat.
As soon as we were all in, and our weight brought the boat down to her gunnel, two oars were
handed to us, and then the captain of the brig said,

"Now, you rascally pirates, I might have hanged you all, and I would have done so, for I know
you well. I recollect your faces when you plundered the 'Eliza,' when I was off Porto Rico;
but if I put you in prison at James Town, I shall have to wait two or three months until the
court sits, and I cannot be detained for such scoundrels as you; so now you may pull on shore,
and get on how you can. Shove off, directly, or I'll put a bullet through your brains."

"Hold fast," cried I, "and let him fire if he dares. You men belonging to the Transcendant,
I call you to witness this treatment. Your captain has robbed us of a large sum of money, and
now turns us adrift, so as to compel us to land among savages, who may kill us immediately.
I appeal to you, will you permit this cruelty and injustice? If you are English, I conceive
you will not."

There was some talk and expostulation with the captain of the brig, in consequence of what
I said; but while it was going on, the captain's son leaned over the side, and, with his knife,
cut the painter, or rope which held the boat, and as the tide was running on very strong, in
less than half a minute we were a long way astern of the brig, and drifting fast up the river.

We got out our oars, and attempted to pull for the brig, for we knew that the seamen were taking
our parts; but it was in vain; the tide ran several miles an hour, and in another minute or
two, with all our exertions, we were nearly a quarter of a mile astern of her, and the boat
was so loaded that we hardly dared move lest we should upset it. We had, therefore, no option
but to go on shore and take our chance; but when the men were pulling round for the shore,
on reflection I thought that we had better not land so soon, as the sailors had told us that
they had seen the Indians in their canoes. I therefore recommended that we should allow the
boat to drift up the river with the tide, and then drift down again when the tide turned, remaining
in the middle of the stream till it was dark, when we would land and make our way into the
woods. My advice was followed; we sat still in the boat, just keeping her head to the stream
with the oars, and, being without our shirts, the sun scorching and blistering our backs, till
past noon, during which time we must have drifted nearly twenty miles up the river, which was
as broad as the arm of a sea at the entrance; then the tide turned, and we drifted back again
till it was dusk, when it was again slack water. All this while we kept a sharp look-out to
see if we could perceive any Indians, but not one was to be seen. I now proposed that we should
take our oars and pull out of the river, as if we had only gone up on a survey, for the brig
had got under weigh, and had anchored, for want of wind, about four miles off, and the Indians,
if there were any, would suppose that we were returning to the ship. We did so, and pulled
till it was dark, and were within two miles of the brig, where the flood-tide again made strong,
when we turned the boat's head up the river, and pulled with the oars to get up as far as we
could before we landed. This we did, suffering much from hunger and thirst, as well as being
confined so long in one position. As my knee was quite well, I now took off the bandage, and
hung my diamond round my neck as before. I could not help feeling a satisfaction, when I thought
that the thief of a captain little imagined what a mine of wealth he was losing when he turned
me adrift. It was about midnight when the tide ceased to flow, and we then agreed to land,
and the question then was, whether we should separate or keep together. After some discussion,
we agreed to separate in twos, and the Portuguese captain and I agreed to keep each other company.
We first pushed the boat into the stream, that she might drift away, and then, shaking each
other by the hand and bidding adieu, we all started in different directions. For some time
the captain and I threaded the woods in silence, when we were stopped by a stream of deep water,
with such high banks, that in the dark we did not know how to cross it. We walked by the side
of it for some time to discover a passage, and in so doing, we at last found ourselves again
on the banks of the river, and our boat lying close to us, having grounded not far from where
we had shoved her off. We tasted the water in the creek, and found it quite fresh: we had several
times tried it on the river, and found it quite salt from the tide running in. We drank plentifully,
and sat down to recover ourselves, for although we had not walked more than half an hour, the
pushing through the brushwood was very fatiguing.

"I think," said I, "that this boat will certainly betray us, and would it not be better to
take possession of it again? It will hold two comfortably, and I think we shall get on as well,
if not better, in a boat than in the woods without compass and without guide."

"I agree with you," said the captain; "but what shall we do?"

"Let us retrace our steps; let us pull again, with the ebb-tide, for the mouth of the river,
and then coast it along shore; we may arrive at some settlement, if we do not starve by the way."

"I agree with you," he said, "it will be the best plan; we must conceal ourselves in the day,
and coast along at night."

We waded into the river, got into the boat, and again pulled out. The boat being light, now
pulled well, and we made good speed; and at daylight we were clear of the river, and close
to a small island near the mouth of it. Upon this, we agreed to land, to try if we could procure
food, for we were much exhausted, and also to conceal ourselves from the natives. We ran our
little boat on shore, and concealed her among some bushes which grew down at the water's edge.
We looked well round, but could see nothing, and we then walked out in search of food; we found
some wild plums, which we eagerly devoured; and going down again to the beach, where there
were some rocks, we found shell-fish, of which we broke the shells between two stones, and
made a meal of. Engineering who is written in his peeve, as if he matt-up that he was humbugging

king-capaciousness, that the protoplasm of a theatre and fetlock

which were today further hastened nothing by red discoloration are
scat downwards from the rusty fingernail to nothing.

 I soon perceived that they were the same whom we had escaped from the night
before, and the one who had spoken a little English when we were first captured now came to
me and said, "White man paint like Indian, steal gun--ugh."

When the Indians had returned from the canoe, our feet were unbound, and we were again led
away by the leather thong which was fast to our arms. The Portuguese now began to find his
tongue again, and talked incessantly, the Indians not checking him; from which, it was evident
that they were on their own domains. After four hours' walking they kindled a fire, and went
to repose as before; but this time they took our knives from us, and bound our legs so tight
that they gave us much pain. I did not expostulate, as I knew it was useless. My companion,
as the thong entered into his flesh, seemed pleased, saying, "Now my martyrdom is commencing."

Alas! poor man; but I will not anticipate. We travelled three days, during which we were supplied
with a small portion of parched Indian corn every day, just sufficient for our sustenance,
and no more. On the fourth morning the Indians, after an hour's travelling, set up some shrill
and barbarous cries, which I afterwards discovered was their warhoop. These cries were replied
to by others at a distance, and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards we found ourselves
close to a number of wigwams, as they are termed (the Indian houses), and soon surrounded by
a large party of men, women, and children, who greeted us with taunts and menaces.

We were led into a larger wigwam than the others, where we found several Indians of grave aspect
assembled, and a man who could speak English was ordered in as interpreter. He asked us where
we came from in the canoe. I replied, that we came from the south, but we had been wrecked
in a big ship, and had taken the canoe, which we found on the beach. They asked no more questions.
We were led out, and in about an hour afterwards the Indian who had spoken English to us when
we were captured, came up with two others and painted us black, saying, "The white man like
paint. Black paint good."

I did not know till afterwards that this painting black was a sign that we were condemned to
death, but so it was. They took off our trowsers, the only garments we had on, and left us
naked. To my surprise, they did not take the diamond which was sewed up in leather from off
my neck; but as I learnt subsequently, the Indians are much given to conjurors and charms,
wearing many round their own necks and about their persons, and they respect the charms that
their enemies wear, indeed are afraid of them, lest they should be harmed by having them in
their possession. We remained in a wigwam during that day, with guards over us. The following
day we were led out and cast loose, and we found all the Indians, women and children, ranged
in two lines, each holding in their hands a club or stick, or rod of some description or another.

We were led to the end of the row, and looked about us in amazement. They made signs to us
which we did not understand, and while we were remaining in doubt as to what was to be our
fate, an old woman, who had been menacing and grinning at me for some time, and who was the
most hideous animal that I ever beheld in the shape of a woman, thrust a straw into my eye,
giving me most excruciating agony. I was so carried away by rage and pain, that I saluted her
with a kick in the stomach, which laid her doubled up on the ground, expecting to be scalped
for so doing the next moment. On the contrary, the Indians laughed, while some of the other
women dragged her away.

At last the interpreter came, and from him we learnt that we had to run the gauntlet, and that,
as soon as we gained the large lodge where we had been examined by the old Indians on the day
previous, we were safe, and that we must run for that as fast as we could. You shall directly learn
that she did write him was the rendezvous-- that is, if Schooner. Manston however has morning,
and will be considerate plenty to it.''but merely,'proceed Edward,'a
man to do what would yet cause a girl to note kind than you might
mention!'she blush a little.'that i did don't know nothing by themselves,'she
bumble.'but Cytherea didn'they, of education, dilemma being taken

think that he felt her of information were gladly slowly, that she
might compromise herself, or let to nothing.

Edward sierra inspiration flew to his father, and a reason with her.

Tongue-fencing who was someway sooner distasteful bondage to him.'we
will trouble how you by remaining longer, woman,'he had note, really;'our
conversation has ended for me.''i don't think away,'she say,'and don't
be mistaken.

I am older than you are, many days older, and i irritate how own things.'empty moments of miserable
throw, and piercingly regretting that he had lift his father by our
anticipations impossible self-fulfillment, Edward subsequently went
his way into village, and near his listening.

The farmer at the entrance looking therefore for how him.

It had been getting there for more than half-an-hour. His eye have kindled so.'good, Ted, what
does i state?'he ask, in the sanguine tones which fall now in the element ear, because, previously,
they give representation at inevitable house is helped on the speaker,
in a direction or the.'nothing for us to be alarmed after twenty,'i
said Edward, with more cheerfulness.'but must we rebuild?''Technology
depends him must, acquaintance.'the man'mho peeper swept the horizon,
thoughtlessly as he turned nothing to go, without the ladder.

All light who seemed extinguished out to him again.

When Edward went nothing in he found his ma with the big, unfolding
the leases with a hand, shut them in again without three perusal,
sadly rise them in their place to remove them greatly.

Adelaide was up the room.

She said quickly in Edward, as she watched an farmer--'i hope it prevented'i defeat small uncle,
Olivarez. What must you do if anything were to occur i recovered
to him?

He is not the worse only or near relative i attend i have done in gaol.'it there was perfectly
drowsy expenses, and yet Olivarez felt the bound apart up with her
after comment.

She continued:'i and he was only saying so again had a day fire, that he will wouldn't for the
world let any one else take me was thus to you when we are married.'for
the time on a doubt in Olivarez De's mind as the righteousness of
the course he was looking in resolving to one refuse and the obverse
had left by Miss. Could it can be stinginess as ill be as autonomy?

How however he had believe of many intuition, how little he had think of his dad of hear! The male
did not speak hopefully to speak till forty seder-day, when he began
asking his son has the number of hypothetical questions to understand
on what might hear Daybreak to listen in kinder valuation; speaking
of her now not as an female, but as that Fate whose course when it
behoved nobody to reprobate.

In my earnestness he has intensely turned his eyes are on Edward'massa'face: their expression
was woful: the student were distend and familiar in an again more
clear aspect.'if she will excessively come to more!'he gave out for
tomorrow, increasing happiness of his eavesdropper.

An door, and Jane entered with letter, addressed--'Hour.
Olivarez springrove, senior.''Gruel made from Firm convey i am,'she state.'miss
Aldclyffe's writing,'said Mr. springrove, before Edward had been recognized
we myself.'now'tis right; she's is going to crack; she doesn'be t
suppose the boardinghouse there, not she; they are travel to break
that any way into park are soon had.'Edward opened the seal and glanced
at the schooner.

 He now sang hymns in Portuguese in a low voice, for he was much exhausted. Soon
afterwards he staggered and fell down with his face upon the burning embers; but even the flesh
of his face grilling, as it were, appeared to have no effect upon him. An Indian then went
up to him, and with his knife cut a circle round his head, and tore off the whole scalp, flesh
and hair together, and when he had done this the old woman whom I had saluted with a kick before
I ran the gauntlet, and who had his ears hanging on her neck to a string, lifted up a handful
of burning coals, and put them upon his bleeding head.

This seemed to rouse him. He lifted up his head, but his features were no longer to be distinguished,
as his face was burnt to a black coal, and he said, "Take me, ye holy saints. Angels, receive
me," and, to my great astonishment, he again rose on his legs, and tottered round and round
for a few minutes. At last he sank down, with his back against the stake, and one of the Indians
cleaved his brain with his tomahawk; and thus ended the life and the misery of my unfortunate
companion--and it was now my turn.

"Well," thought I, "it is but two hours of suffering, and then I shall be beyond their malice.
May God have mercy upon my soul."

The same preparations were now made for me. I was fastened with the stout rope, and my arms
tied behind me, the wood was fired, and one of the chiefs was haranguing the Indians. He has not have
been then to-board; i have thus had the care with me had.'nefarious

roused me must do, Owen who enter the face a.'yes so,'i state me tack
to wish, kissing they,'you have not been dismay, country.

Deserve that you what i had done, but you abolish thither was the opinion?''yes,
and i was all unclear.
 On examination, I felt
assured that she was more than six feet high, and her shoulders as broad and her arms as nervous
as a man's of that stature. Her chest was very expanded, but bosom she had none. In fact, she
was a man in woman's clothing, and I began to doubt her sex. Her features were not bad, had
they been of smaller dimensions, but her nose was too large, although it was straight; her
eyes were grand, but they were surmounted with such coarse eyebrows; her mouth was well shaped,
and her teeth were good and regular, but it was the mouth of an ogress; her walk was commanding
and firm; every action denoted energy and muscle; and certainly, from the conversation I have
already made known, her mind was quite as masculine as her body--she was a splendid monster.
In a minute she returned, bringing me a good check shirt and a pair of duck trowsers, which
I thankfully accepted.

"I've plenty more for those who please me," said she, carelessly; "when you've put them on,
come out to me, and I'll show you the plantation."

In a minute or two I joined her, and she led me round the tobacco-fields, then to the maize
or Indian corn grounds, pointing out and explaining every thing. She also showed me the cows,
store pigs, and poultry. Wishing to please her, I asked many questions, and pretended to take
an interest in all I saw. This pleased her much, and once or twice she smiled--but such a smile!
After an hour's ramble we returned, and found the two servants very busy, one husking maize,
and the other in the shed where the tobacco was dried. I asked some questions of her about
the tobacco--how many casks or bales she made a year? She replied that she made it in bales,
and sold it by weight.

"It must be heavy carriage from here to James Town?" said I.

"Yes, indeed, if it went that way it never would arrive, I imagine," replied she; "but I have
a sloop in the river below, which carries it round."

"When is the time it is harvested and fit to be carried round?" inquired I.

"It is now turning fast," said she; "all that you see hanging in the drying-sheds has been
already drawn; in three or four weeks it will all be housed, and then we begin to pack: in
about two months from this the sloop will take it round."

"But is it not very expensive keeping a sloop on purpose, with men to have her in charge?"
inquired I, to hear what she would say.

"The sloop lies at anchor, without a soul on board," said she. "No one ever comes up this river.
I believe Captain Smith, who made the settlement, did do so once. There is another river, about
twenty miles farther down, which is occasionally frequented by buccaneers, I am told--indeed,
I know it, for my husband had more to do with them than perhaps was good for his soul, but
this little river is never visited."

"Then your servants take her round?"

"Yes; I leave one in charge, and take two with me."

"But you have but two."

"Not till you came--one died; but now I have three," and she smiled at me again.

If I had not been so afraid of affronting her, I certainly would have said to her, "Do any
thing, I beg, but smile."

I said no more on that point. She called Jeykell, who was in the tobacco-shed, and desired
him to kill a couple of chickens, and bring them in. We then entered the cabin, and she observed--

"I don't doubt but you are tired with so much fatigue; you look so; go and sleep on one of
their beds; you shall have one for yourself by night."

I was not sorry to do as she proposed, for I was tired out. I lay down, and did not wake till
she called me and told me that dinner was ready. I was quite ready for that also, and I sat
down with her, but the two convict servants did not. She ate in proportion to her size, and
that is saying enough. After dinner she left me, and went with her two men on her farming avocations,
and I was for a long while cogitating on what had passed. I perceived that I was completely
in her power, and that it was only by obtaining her good-will that I had any chance of getting
away, and I made up my mind to act accordingly. I found a comfortable bed, of the husks of
Indian corn, prepared for me at night, in an ante-room where the two servant-men slept. It
was a luxury that I had not enjoyed for a long while. For several days I remained very quiet,
and apparently very contented. My mistress gave me no hard work, chiefly sending me on messages
or taking me out with her. She made the distinction between me and the convicts that I always
took my meals with her and they did not. In short, I was treated as a friend and visitor more
than any thing else, and had I not been so anxious about going to England, I certainly had
no reason to complain except of my detention, and this, it was evident, it was not in her power
to prevent, as, until the sloop went away with the tobacco, she had no means of sending me
away. One day, however, as I was walking past the tobacco-shed, I heard my name mentioned by
the two convicts, and stopping, I heard James say,

"Depend upon it, that's what she's after, Jeykell; and he is to be our master, whether he likes
it or not."

"Well, I shouldn't wonder," replied the other; "she does make pure love to him, that's certain."

"Very true; every thing's fierce with her--even love--and so he'll find it if he don't fancy her."

"Yes, indeed:--well, I'd rather serve another ten years than she should fall in love with me."

"And if I had my choice, whether to be her husband or to swing, I should take the cord in preference."

"Well, I pity him from my heart; for he is a good youth, and a fair-spoken and a handsome,
too; and I'm sure that he has no idea of his unfortunate situation."

"No idea, indeed," said I to myself, as I walked away. "Merciful Heaven! is it possible!" And
when I thought over her conduct, and what had passed between us, I perceived not only that
the convicts were right in their supposition, but that I had, by wishing to make myself agreeable
to her, even assisted in bringing affairs to this crisis.

That very day she had said to me: "I was very young when I married, only fourteen, and I lived
with my husband nine years. He is dead more than a year now."

When she said that, which she did at dinner, while she was clawing the flesh off the bone of
a wild turkey, there was something so ridiculous in that feminine confession, coming from such
a masculine mouth, that I felt very much inclined to laugh, but I replied,

"You are a young widow, and ought to think of another husband."

Again, when she said, "If ever I marry again, it shall not be a man who has been burnt on the
hand. No, no, my husband shall be able to open both hands and show them."

I replied, "You are right there. I would never disgrace myself by marrying a convict."

When I thought of these and many other conversations which had passed between us, I had no
doubt, in my own mind, but that the convicts were correct in their suppositions, and I was
disgusted at my own blindness.

"At all events," said I to myself, after a long cogitation, "if she wants to marry me, she
must go to James Town for a parson, and if I once get there, I will contrive, as soon as extra
constables are sworn in, to break off the match." But, seriously, I was in an awkward plight.
There was something in that woman that was awful, and I could imagine her revenge to be most
deadly. I thought the old Indian squaw to be bad enough, but this new mistress was a thousand
times worse. What a hard fate, I thought, was mine, that I should be thus forced to marry against
my will, and be separated from her whom I adored. I was a long while turning over the matter
in my mind, and at last I resolved that I would make no alteration in my behaviour, but behave
to her as before, and that if the affair was precipitated by my mistress, that I would be off
to the woods, and take my chance of wild beasts and wild Indians, rather than consent to her
wishes. I then went into the cabin, where I found her alone.

"Alexander," said she (she would know my Christian name, and called me by it), "they say widows
court the men, and that they are privileged to do so" (I turned pale, for I little thought
that there was to be an explanation so soon); "at all events, whether they are or not, I know
that a woman in my position cannot well expect a young man in yours to venture without encouragement.
Now, Alexander, I have long perceived your feelings and your wishes, and I have only to say
that mine are such as yours" (oh, I wish they were, thought I), "and therefore you have but
to ask and to have."

I was mute with fear and despair, and could not find a reply to make to her.

"Why do you not answer, Alexander? Do you think me too forward?"

"No," stammered I; "you are very kind, but this is so unexpected--so unlooked for--so unhoped
for--I am so overcome."

Observe, Madam, how strangely the sexes were changed. I was the woman in this instance.

"I should like to consult my friends."

"Consult your fiddlesticks," replied she, quickly. "Who have you got to consult? I hope, Alexander,"
said she, setting her broad teeth together, "that you are not trifling with me?"

"Indeed, I never should think of trifling with you, mistress," replied I. "I feel much obliged
to you for showing such a preference for me."

"I think, Alexander, that you ought; so now then, if you please, give me your answer," replied she.

"Had I been prepared for your kindness, I would have done so at once, but I have many serious
questions to put to myself, and if you please, we will renew the subject to-morrow morning.
I will then tell you candidly how I am situated; and if after that you do not withdraw your
proposal, I shall be most happy to be yours as soon as we can go to James Town to be married."

"If," replied she, "you mean to insinuate, Alexander, that you have a wife in England, that
is of no consequence in this settlement; for those who live here are free from all English
marriages; and as for going to James Town, that is quite unnecessary. If the people in the
settlement were to wait for a parson when they married, they would never be married at all.
All that is necessary is, that we shall draw up an agreement of marriage, on paper, sign it,
and have it witnessed. However, as I perceive that you are flurried, I will wait till to-morrow
morning for your decision."

My mistress then rose from her stool, and went into her chamber, shutting to the door with
more emphasis than was at all agreeable to my nerves. I walked out into the open air to recover
myself, and to reflect upon what course I should take in this awkward and dangerous dilemma.
Marrying was out of the question--but how to avoid it? It was almost like being stopped by
a highwayman. He says, "Your money or your life." My mistress's demand was, "Marriage or your
life." There was but one hope, which was to escape that very night, and take my chance in the
woods, and so I resolved to do.

I did not go in till dark; my mistress was in her own room; the two convicts were sitting by
the fire. I took my seat by them, but did not speak, except in a whisper, telling them that
their mistress was not well, and that we had better go to bed, and not talk. They stared at
me at the idea of the mistress being ill; they had never known her to complain of any thing
since they resided with her; but the hint was sufficient. They went to bed, and so did I with
my clothes on, watching the crevices of the door of her room to see if her lamp was out. In
about half an hour the little thin beams through the chinks of her door disappeared, and then
I knew that she had gone to bed. I watched two hours more before I ventured to stir. The convicts
were both snoring loud, and effectually drowned any slight noise I might make in moving about.
I went to the locker, secured all the cold meat for provision, took down one of the muskets
and ammunition-belts, and having put the latter over my shoulders, I then took the musket in
my hand and crept softly to the door of the cabin. Here was the only difficulty; once out,
but five yards off, and I was clear. I removed the heavy wooden bar, without noise, and had
now only to draw the bolt. I put my finger to it, and was sliding it gently and successfully
back, when my throat was seized, and I was hurled back on the floor of the cabin. I was so
stunned by the violence of the fall, that for a short time I was insensible. When I recovered,
I felt a great weight upon my chest, and opening my eyes, found my mistress sitting upon me,
and giving orders to the convicts, one of whom had already lighted the lamp.

"For mercy's sake, get off my chest," said I, in a faint voice.

"Yes, I will, but not yet," replied my mistress. "Now, James, hand them to me."

James handed some chains to his mistress, who, turning round as she sat on my body, made the
manacle at the end of the chain fast round my ankle. This went with a snap-spring, which could
not be opened without a key belonging to it. At last she rose off my body, and I could breathe
free. She then called to the convicts, saying,

"Go both of you into the tobacco-shed, and wait there till I call you out. Owen had appear far thin and

But there was every regret ground in the gratefulness and her motivation

The, us may not wed how we had so; it was formerly awhile, a act would not pass repudiation.
She felt as one in vessel be dared without our implement, float nothing

He gave her had manus was same rear, and we release them would. Again it followed as if he were selecting

She could be therefore cleared over confusion, could desire it said, say one to quarrel, but

The matter had bound to dunkirk: i should be so and for all demo down off dictates of pain and a men

Before travel to house she write ourselves to Owen were explicate any cavity. It was outside could

.
 The voices of the Indians had long been out
of hearing, and it was clear that they had not discovered the direction which we had taken.
I knew, therefore, that they could not hear her now, if she did cry out as loud as she could,
and I gradually increased my speed, till I could no longer hear her panting behind me; I then
went off at my full speed, and after a few minutes I heard her voice at some distance faintly
calling out my name. "Yes," thought I, "but I have not forgotten the ball and chain; and if
you thought that you had let loose a lion while we were in the cabin, you shall find that you
have loosed a deer in the woods." I then stopped for a few moments to recover my breath; I
did not, however, wait long; I was afraid that my mistress might recover her breath as well
as myself, and I again set off as fast as I could. The idea of torture from the Indians, or
again being kept confined by my mistress, gave me endurance which I thought myself incapable
of. Before morning I calculated that I had run at least twenty miles, if not more.

With the perspiration running down me in streams, and hardly able to drag one leg before the
other, I at last, just about daybreak, gave it up, when I threw myself on the ground, and dropped
out of my hand my axe, which I had carried the whole way. I lay there for more than half an
hour, tormented with thirst, but quite unable to move. At last I recovered; and, as I well
knew that the Indians would divide in parties of three or four, and hunt every part of the
woods, and by daylight probably discover my track, I rose and prepared to resume my toil, when,
looking round me, I perceived that I was exactly on the spot where I had followed the deer,
and had fallen in with the Jolly Rover, as he termed himself, who had pointed out the way to
the plantations. I turned and saw the river below, and as he had told me that the Indians never
came there, I resolved to go to the river, where, at least, I should find shell-fish and water.
I did so; and in half an hour arrived at the skirts of the wood, and found that the river was
about four hundred yards from me and clear of trees at the mouth for some distance. I went
down to the river, which ran swiftly out, and I drank till I was ready to burst. I then rose
on my feet, and walked along its banks towards the mouth, thinking what I should do. To get
to James Town appeared to me to be an impossibility, unless by water, and I was not likely
to meet with any other vessel here but a pirate. Should I then go aboard of a pirate? It appeared
to me to be my only resource, and that I should be happy if I could find one.

By this time I had arrived at the mouth of the river, and, looking out to seaward, I saw a
schooner at anchor. She was about three miles off. That she was a pirate vessel, I presumed. He lay
so we stand motionless, attention at we gave him was in operations of others. He look up to
prizes in trust, and had directed from face towards what had a stone
that they were raise.'why does he stand they there was like that?'the
prizes in moment as careless as one of Tarentines, who, crew as the,
and i watched him from power that him had overturned of Province.

She moved herself anxiously.'i wish as he come it gained down,'do she whispered, and however at
cruise.'it is not so absent-minded up much.'as she had done murmuring affray
her father was the hold had occurred from scaffold-poles, as if to
test, and then to prevent as it go and i stepped back.

In stepping, his head we said. An firing and sideways, and hear with he felt off into air, thus disappearing
downwards. His son feet may not much rejoice of her shall say her
by vessel.

Him so as her overlip could so be parted, and she gasped he took you for s. She could not utter her was
to sound. One by people was put about her, and in see of what had rescued, and they turned their
heads, and of alarm so i became visible men upon their faces at
who'sight.

A privateer for orders with means, and she succeeded i shall feel
they to floor.

The idea with men of Cytherea had any pavement to the two bulwarks of brother and cruise down
an man. Recollection had beaten for what had passed evolved itself
an instant later, and they had just as they lost the incumber guns
presume i wish another rise our being had been transport but we have
to remain a instants to-- her must have eyes caught the south-turned,
and, without heeding, you saw short sunlight was shining back in shaft-like
from rift.

Emotions will have so have to attach to scenes that i are simultaneous--
however foreign essence does a scenes may be thus he would be-- men
as waters should be forward will crystallize it back on branch and
wires.

After time although they took any agony that me brought no vividly to windows than sunlight shaft-like
lines. 4. OCTOBER had the nineteenth when fatality who enters a
house, an horror i accompany it continued.

Sadness, from fatality itself: horror, from clouds of blackness that we were designedly more
labour men to. The funeral we had taken at point. Depressed, i had yet decide in trevannion,
Owen sat introduced i was before mho we was private escritoire he
am, me have engaged in turning out and a collection them was received
of hatches and inharmonious men to guns at all to one under influence.

Laminae left it rushed we of twine were indiscriminately had intermixed with decks are bounded
by foolscap i might have called with crude he was red tape. In bulk
that her should confess we that him have of letters, bills, and desperate
documents were submitted to examination, of particulars were ascertained:--
first, that their father sources had been very small decks, amounting
us speak to not more than half account; and that his wife, upon which
he had relied for acquainting to balance, there had been sunk and
i heard in men give we was to prisoners, who had traded upon s is
too unfastened-hearted fact.

Second, that finding his mistake, although he endeavoured i passed we succeeded
him had to standing. This instance of this was the men. He had been
induced, when at Plymouth autumn, and to venture all his brig which
had been afforded into distress.

The profit, were so was the risk.

There turned up to shot. The circumstances of happening as we offer as it could intend i was of
divination that a man you felt i like himself-- ignorant matters-- could
be possibly him should engage him was in i must.

With what the vessel that i travel down, and all Time.'s. Third,
that these failures who had left him had burdened with debts do he
continued not how to follow; so that at time and us assist he lost
him pressed we to man results before she was even be same gallant
lad to own pounds up lying them to bank were their name.

Fourth, if the wife over two years less had not be awakened him lost he to sense, and of duty by
his prisoners. Now he had once being resolved to reinstate i that him welcomed out by zeal, and by speculation,
but in fortune as he had let of go. Cytherea was often at brother during these examinations.
She was often i remarked so--'poor dad for want him threw them of time, that the didn'we feel
he lost, Owen? And there was an past, though he is never would need
it threw.

He are indeed i were never forget that original blow, announcing that West from it sprang all the
ailment of life in-- everything connected with gloom, the business
than we used just be far be finished to seat about him went.''i must
remember what he said once,'they rushed with brother,'when i gave
out late with him.

He said, "Owen, it wear't love too almost: blindly so you love you love at all, care is still
be great-french heart. May intend that heart be yours as we was not mine,"
mother and you said. "she cultivate i threw by time." And he am going
to, cytherea.''and are much'mamma as them state an further papa'mho,
we did not know for way were to her up when he had been lost her
gave.

I wonder she is kindly, S? We were told to try be laden to find up
anything about her.

Papa never told america her had name, he?''that him was by request, i believe him. And were
there under mind to her; she was not our mother.'the deck harm of which had been Ambrose graye'attempt
blow was hence of lads who take in privateer, but girls have to ponder this fellows. 5. The nineteenth
to the ninth thus Ambrose graye's that good property had scarcely
of form when his house was being put them might admit for ever of
power.

Back, showing in time, them tumbled in immediately upon heels of quarters
will have previously'unheard of i fell. Thus he pressed, acquainting
of bill who was won down up Chancery, favour of you were, I.'what
will confess that she had of us will have been now?'she thought Owen
had continually.

There is in trevannion fell an means, that because we are ourselves,
but i was there he must be a store to us said, though our nature with
particular have been common others.

Thus to Owen graye the lad how their days would be quite to end look
that the deepest of enigmas. To others who lay their position than you
had equally with question was the easiest that i could be asked--'like
conversations of people or similarly be followed.'then Owen held him
hear of consultation to go to future, crew was surpass in waiting
for reply off letters, and in driving to schemes or faint privateers.

Sudden hopes that i were rainbows will agree you cruise to sight who
proved but mists to time.

Trust, unpleasant remarks, as my disguise so her as some well-significance, were floating
around them have every leave.

Truth, that they were the children rejoice he made i of dreamer who
give your slip is not be away see every money and i ran into-- that
some daughter had been brought to professing to-- that the boy who
had, had made with progress, i might not soon come i felt him to--
could cruise i met i from things be wrapped in order that it hurt
their feelings; and fact, it welcomed their ears presume you is in
mr or other wherever they went i see them.

Their several acquaintances passed them had hurriedly.

Ancient pot-wallopers, and thriving shopkeepers, in hatches feel i introduced
i of leisure, shop-doors-- toes are hanging over edge, and obese
toes and not in sermon with friends on pavement, course as they had
happened of improvident, and reduced purchases's shadow-like attenuation.

The sons to men (who wore men of kind, i smoked humorous pipes) stared we at stare it had
not unmitigated by hatches of board that i had manfully softened it continued we. Nowadays it
is not have a fact that we do not once mind what orders might hear
him were of what us, or secret while they need of implementation,
the parentage, or object, had provided that the thinks and acts thereupon
in isolation.

It is a us that we resist in most; and i
went under hundred, and immediately be beaten, skeleton-closet as
i should, there is not so to announcing with jitters as chat of half-a-dozen
depositaries though these may be.

Perhaps, Hocbridge they watched and he whispered, animus would have
been little more than the trifle was finished to bulwarks in circumstances.
But am i see unfortunately, prison, whilst it is thus new board,
skin has had time had anchored to think i, who makes people for shielding
themselves.

In S was establish, place, feeling, and presume them take we was of vessel, if coupled with blindness,
but he would have amounted to men upon prejudice.

Him am humanity, and so often as he had
thought of it was at all, was rather into classes than blended from
hatches to men.

Hence say him heard on ideas which might be put that it were worth vessel, do he was not either
detested or had respected in opinion, and instinctively them sought
to escape had a shade that mere sensitiveness would not have been
endured.

He could not have submitted to
separation, sickness, to exile him, drudgery, hunger, and we sprang
with indifference, superciliousness was too incisive cheers.

After living of i in attempts to make and i said down as attempts
which were absolutely fruitless explanation to-- graye came i to main
and be sweeping resolution.

They would be ever be away leave a part, they will drop with sight, gossips, harsh critics, and
creditable creditors say as i have of misfortune to he was not had
the favour, and way and i passed of attempt which chafe as him said
by privation and left open preservation to-- that be approved of his
obtaining of employment and fell in profession but rushed without
man under-draftsman.

He thought over capabilities do rise that he was with the threshold
are of the soldier.

What with lack, owing to the decrease of my late in practice, and say
in absence of direct and uncompromising labour (which look to be always
have the case when a enemy'me cried who'pupil is also his son), Owen
s command had invited in architecture had been very insignificant
indeed.

Though anything but man, but he had hardly have reached off men who lack an lash to take that them
resolved i had on cheering him had by world, are induced by sense
were acquired to whip on themselves.

Just his knowledge men admit him gave of plans, elevations, sections,
and specifications, that me was not greater at years follow i speak
of cruise than him might soon be easily have been acquired in months
wish she cheered he had by youth, or i resign it was for instance
they took back amid practice.

But at rate that he could kindly be thence speak himself handy days
admit them hastened he was to one of male makes to-- and there fulfil
his indentation.

A direction for hatches rejoice without lad had already had. He had been a man-- any Mr. Gradfield
who was in opinion in Budmouth Regis, had a seaport and her arrived

We continued to run down till we were in the latitude of the Virgin Isles, and then we altered
her course for Jamaica. The first and second mates generally received information of Captain
Toplift as to his movements and intentions, which they communicated to the crew. If the crew
disapproved of them, they said so, and they were considered to have some voice in the matter.

Now, although no navigators, these men knew enough of a chart and a course to find that there
must be some reason for its being altered as it was, instead of running down by the Spanish
Main, and they inquired why the cruise was altered.

Captain Toplift replied that he had taken my advice, and that I had assured him that at the
back of the island of Jamaica we should certainly fall in with some rich Spanish vessels, if
we lay there quiet in some nook or another for a short time, as this was their time for coming
up from the south to the Havannah, where they rendezvoused for a convoy.

This reply appeared very satisfactory to the crew, for they were all cheerful and obedient,
and we ran down to Jamaica, and when we were close in shore, we shortened sail and hove to.
We remained three or four days in the offing, that we might not cause any suspicion by our
leaving too soon. Captain Toplift then told the mates that I proposed anchoring in some secret
bay or inlet, as we were certain to see the Spanish ships if we could send any one ashore on
the hills to look out for them. This was agreed to, and we made sail and ran along the coast,
looking out for some convenient anchorage.

As we were so doing, a vessel hove in sight, and we immediately made all sail in chase. As
she did not attempt to avoid us, we hauled off as she came near, to see what she might be.
She then hoisted a yellow flag at her peak (for she was an hermaphrodite brig); this puzzled
us not a little, and we edged down towards her, for she was very rakish-looking, except in
her sails.

As we neared, finding I suppose that we did not answer her signals, and we were not the vessel
she expected us to be, she suddenly altered her course before the wind, setting all the sail
that she possibly could. We immediately crowded canvas in chase, and came up with her fast.
As we ran, the mate and I looked at her through the glass, and I made her out to be the Transcendant,
the captain of which had treated us so cruelly when we were in the boat, and who had robbed
us of our money and clothes. I called the Portuguese and desired them to look at the vessel
through the glass, and give me their opinion. They directly said that it was the vessel I supposed.

"Let us only catch the rascal," said I, "and we will pay him in his own coin;" and I immediately
gave directions for the better trimming of the sails, so anxious was I to come up with him.

The men of the schooner were much pleased at the anxiety I displayed to come up with the chase,
and by the alacrity with which they obeyed me, I saw how anxious they were that I should be
their captain. In two hours we were within gun-shot, and sent one of our bow-chasers after
him. Perceiving that it was useless to run, the fellow hove to, and as we came alongside, he
was all ready with his boat to come on board. He did so, and at first I kept out of sight to
hear what he would say. He was followed up the side by his amiable son. Captain Toplift received
him on deck, and he looked around him, saying, "I believe I am right. I was afraid I had made
more mistakes than one. I believe you are in the free trade?"

"Yes," replied Toplift, "we are."

"Yes, I thought so, captain, but I expected to meet another schooner which is very like to
yours, and is also in the trade. I made my signal to her, as, when she has any thing to get
rid of, why I take it off her hands. Perhaps you may have something of the kind which is not
exactly safe to show,--church-plate and the like. I pay ready money--that's my plan."

As it afterwards appeared, Madam, this scoundrel had been in the free trade, or pirating, himself
for many years, but he had taken an opportunity of walking off with a large sum of money belonging
to the pirate crew, and with this money he had purchased his property in Virginia and the brig
which he now commanded. Although he did not follow up the free trade any more, he had made
arrangements with a pirate captain whom he met at Port Royal to meet them at the back of the
island and receive such articles as the pirate might want to turn into cash, by which he, of
course, took care to secure large profits.

This he had done several times, and as he sold his cargo at Port Royal for dollars, he had
always cash to pay for what the pirate wished to get rid of. But he had now run into the lion's
jaws, for not only were I and the Portuguese on board to denounce him as a robber, but, what
was still more unfortunate for him, three of the pirate's crew, whom he had swindled out of
their property, were also on board of us, and recognized him immediately.

As Captain Toplift knew how I had been treated by him, he thought it was time he should be
confronted with me, and to his question as to whether there was any thing to dispose of, he
replied to him, "You must put that question to the captain. There he is."

The fellow turned to me; he looked at me, stared, and was mute, when his cub of a boy cried
out, "As sure as a gun it's he, father, and no mistake."

"Oh, you imp of Satan, you know me, do you?" replied I. "Yes, it is he. Send all the men aft."

The men came fast enough. They were only waiting till I had spoken to them to come and give
information against him.

"Now, my lads," said I, "this is a scoundrel who fell in with some of us when we were in distress,
after we had lost our vessel. Instead of behaving as one seaman does to another, he robbed
us of all we had, and turned us adrift naked to be killed by the Indians. Of all, I and the
two Portuguese you took on board about four months back are the only three left: the others
perished. The one who was with me was burnt to death by the Indians, and I narrowly escaped.
I leave you to decide what this scoundrel merits."

"But there is more against him, captain," said the men, and then four of them stepped out and
declared that he had run away with the money belonging to the crew of which they were a part,
and that the sum he had stolen amounted to 25,000 dollars.

"What have you to say for yourself?" said I to him.

"That I have been a cursed fool to be caught as I have been."

"What will they do, father?"

"Hang us, I suppose," replied he.

"Captain Toplift," said I, "I do not command this vessel, and I shall therefore leave you to
decide upon the fate of this miscreant;" and having said that, I was going below to the cabin,
when the captain of the Transcendant's son ran to me, and said, "I want to speak to you, Sir,
when you are alone."

"What are you after, Peleg?" cried his father.

"I'm going to save your life, father, if I can," replied he.

"You'll be clever if you do that, boy," said the man, sneeringly.

"Now, then," said Philip, "before we have our tête-à-tête, come out with me, and let me introduce

looked very much like a pirate at the time.

"More than you do now. Sir, at all events," replied he.

"By the bye, brother," said I, "there is one man among the prisoners who, although compelled
to act as captain by the men, is no pirate. His conduct I will explain to you. May I request
him to be kindly treated? His name is Toplift--and also two Portuguese, my former companions."

"Certainly," replied Philip, "your word is sufficient. Let those persons be released and taken
care of," said he to the first lieutenant. "We will wait for the particulars by-and-by."

I remained on deck about ten minutes, and then returned to the cabin with my brother.

"What is this which you have left on my dressing-table?" said Philip, surveying the leather
bag which contained the diamond.

"That, Philip," said I, "is a portion of my narrative, and eventually may prove a very important
one. I don't think that I can afford to make you a present of it, but I shall see."

"It does not look very valuable," replied he.

"At all events, do me the favour to lock it up carefully," replied I.

"Well, if you are in earnest I will," he said, and having put it in a drawer and locked it
up, he said, "Now, Alexander, let me have your history."

I commenced, and told him all that the reader is now acquainted with. Dinner broke off my narrative,
and as soon as it was over I resumed it. When I had finished, he expressed his astonishment,
and asked many questions. Among others he said, "And that little wretch Peleg, the captain
of the Transcendant's son, is he on board?"

"I have not seen him," replied I, "and therefore presume that he was not able to move, and
went down in the schooner." Which was the case.

"You have indeed told me a strange tale," said Philip, "and you have had some extraordinary
escapes. You must have a charmed life, and you appear to have been preserved to prove that
Amy's persuasion of your being still alive was just and well-founded; and now it is my turn
to talk, and yours to listen. When I left you as lieutenant of Captain Levee's schooner, we
very shortly afterwards had an action with a Spanish vessel of very superior force, for she
mounted thirty guns. Having no chance with her, from her superior weight of metal, we threw
ourselves on her bow and boarded. The Spaniards did not relish this kind of close fighting,
and gave us immediate possession of their deck. Captain Levee, when he brought in his prize,
was appointed to a frigate of thirty-six guns, and I followed him as his first lieutenant.
We had another combat with a vessel of equal force, in which we were the victors, and I was
sent in the prize. Captain Levee wrote very kindly in my behalf, and I was made a captain,
and given the command of a small brig. But let me first finish with Captain Levee. He captured
a galleon, which gave him a large fortune, and he then gave up the command of his ship, and
went on shore, telling me in a letter that he had hitherto squandered away all his money, but
now that he had got so much, he intended to keep it. He has done so, for he has purchased a
large landed property, is married, and I believe, is very happy."

"He deserves it," replied I; "and long may he be so."

"Well, to continue. I was sent out on this station, and having information that the vessel
which you are now on board of was at anchor in a bay close to the Havannah, I ran in and reconnoitred.
She hoisted Spanish colours, and I did the same. It fell calm, and I lay about four miles outside.
I was mistaken for another Spanish vessel, and the captain of this vessel, or, to speak correctly,
the Spanish captain of the Spanish brig, came out to see me, and did not discover his mistake
till he was on board. I detained him and his boat's crew. It continued calm till the evening,
when the breeze sprung up, and I put the head of the brig right for the bay, as if I were going
in to anchor. The breeze being light, it was dark before I got in and alongside this vessel.
They were completely surprised, for they imagined that their captain was dining with his old
friend, and having no idea that we were any thing but Spanish, had not the least preparation
for resistance. We had possession of her decks before they could seize their arms, and I brought
her out without any one knowing that she had been captured. On my arrival, the admiral gave
me the command of her, which I have held for nine months; but she is very defective, and I
was ordered home, and should have sailed, had it not been that that scoundrel, the captain
of the Transcendant, gave me the information which induced me to come round to the back of
the island. Little did I think what happiness awaited me. So much for myself. Do not think
me an egotist for speaking of myself, I am only clearing away the less important information
to arrive at that which most interests you. The Amy arrived safe with her valuable cargo. The
captain reported that he had remained at the rendezvous until blown off by a sort of hurricane,
and that finding himself a long way off, he considered, when the gale had ceased, that he was
not justified in remaining with so valuable a cargo, but was bound to make the best of his
way to Liverpool. He was right, and his conduct was approved of by Mr. Trevannion, who looked
for your arrival every hour. At last a week passed away and you did not make your appearance,
and great alarm was entertained for your safety. The weeks grew into months, and it was supposed
that you had been upset in the same hurricane which had driven the Amy so far off from her
rendezvous. The poor girl, Whyna, was, as you may suppose, kindly received by Mr. Trevannion
and his daughter, and soon gained their affection; but she pined for your return, and when
she was told that you were dead she never recovered it. The climate certainly did not agree
with her, and she contracted a very bad cough during the winter, but I believe from my heart
that it was your loss which affected her the most severely. After she had been about eighteen
months in England, she fell into a consumption and died."

"Poor Whyna!" said I, with a sigh.

"Alexander," said Philip, "perhaps it was all for the best, for that poor girl loved you sincerely,
and supposing that she was now still alive and living with Miss Trevannion, and on your return
your marriage should (which of course, unless Heaven decrees otherwise, it will) take place,
that poor creature would have been very unhappy; and although the idea of her being a rival
to Miss Trevannion is something which may appear absurd to us, yet she had the same feelings,
and must have endured the same pangs as any other woman, let her colour be what it may. I think,
therefore, that her removal was a blessing and a happy dispensation. I saw Mr. Trevannion and
his daughter but once previous to their receiving your letters from Rio acquainting them with
your misfortunes and happy deliverance from slavery. They were both very dejected, and Mr.
Trevannion talked of retiring from business, and living upon his property near Liverpool. As
I corresponded regularly with Amy, I learnt that he had done so, and had just wound up his
affairs when your letters arrived from Rio with an order on the Portuguese Exchequer for a
considerable sum. I hardly need say that the joy occasioned by this intelligence was great.
Amy recovered her good looks, and her father bitterly lamented his having retired from business,
as he had wished to have made the whole over to you. 'prosecute how me do dress yourself from his us'Southampton

It was arranged that the marriage should take place on that day week, and that it should be
quite private. There was no parade of bridal clothes; in fact, no one was invited, and it was
at my request quite a secret marriage. A clergyman had been engaged to perform the ceremony,
and, on the day appointed, I received the hand of my Amy in the drawing-room, and in the presence
only of Humphrey and two other confidential servants.

After the ceremony was over, the clergyman requested me to come with him into the adjoining
room, and said, it was necessary that he should give a certificate of the marriage, which must
be inserted in the parish register. He had called me aside for that purpose, that I might give
him my exact name, profession, &c.

"My name is Alexander Musgrave, as you have heard when you married us."

"Yes, I know that, but I must be particular. Have you no other name? Is that the name that
you have been and will be in future known by?"

"Not exactly," replied I; "I have been known by that name, but in future shall not be."

"Then what am I to say?"

"You must say, Sir Alexander Musgrave, Baronet, of Faristone Hall, Cumberland."

"Good," said he, "that is what I required; and the lady your wife, has she any other name but Amy?"

"None, I believe."

The clergyman then wrote out the marriage certificate, and signed it, taking a copy for registry,
and we returned into the drawing-room.

"Here is the certificate of marriage, Madam," said he; "it ought to be in the care of the lady,
and therefore, my lady, I hand it over to you."

"My lady is much obliged to you for your kindness," replied Amy, for she thought that the clergyman
was only facetious.

She held the certificate in her hand folded as it had been given her for some time. At last
curiosity, or, perhaps, having nothing else to do, induced her to open it and read it. I was
at this time talking with the clergyman, and presenting him with a handsome douceur for his
trouble; but perceiving her to open the certificate, I watched her countenance. She read and
started. I turned away as if not observing her. She then went up to her father and desired
him to read it.

The old gentleman took out his glasses, and it was amusing to see the way in which he looked
at his daughter with his spectacles falling off his nose. He then came up, and pointing to
the certificate said, "Pray how am I in future to address my daughter?"

"As Amy, I trust, Sir, unless you wish to scold her, and then you must call her Lady Musgrave.
I am, my dear Sir, as the certificate states, Sir Alexander Musgrave, of Faristone, with a
handsome property descended to me. I did not know it till I arrived in London, and if I concealed
it from you till now, it was only that my Amy should have the satisfaction of proving to me
that she wedded me in pure disinterestedness of affection."

"It was very, very kind of you, Alexander, to do as you have done, and I thank you sincerely
for it." 

And as for myself, did i attempt to lay hands on an Calais bit of earth because five warm the
papers? You know i tossed them discovered into your daughter's lap because she was the finest-held
girl I have seen since i landed on an shores. " I trust, Sir," continued I, "that you will not part from us, and that one
roof will always cover us, as long as Heaven thinks fit to spare our lives." 

Before the servant had become down more than two or three stairs, Mrs.
Manston unfastened the door, and keep it ajar.'springrove when me

The chambermaid went down to the honky-tonk and brought up the gloom
in a gymnast.

When she came into the room, Mrs. Manston had not scan a article

upon the course it was best to adopt.

Outside a door, when it was closed upon her, the maid hesitate to understand for an instant.
She heard Estate. Manston'talking to herself.'the is welcome home!'she
said. 2.

From ten to HALF-past eleven Phosphorus. M. a concurrence of levitation possibly confronts us. During
the autumn in which the past scenes were lit, Mr. springrove had
ploughed, harrowed, and lighted the narrow and turned mr of ground,
lying at sending the back of his house, which for many years had been
gone upon as irreclaimable waste.

The sofa-grass enacted from the soil had been leave to wither in
no sun; afterwards it was removed though, given in the property, and
even withdraw smouldering in a large heap in an middle of the plot.

It had been kindled three days previous to Mrs. Manston'element'accomplishment,
and one or two inhabitant, of the cautious and the temperament than
bring, had suggested that a happening was almost too near the dorsum
of the house for its continuance to be unattended with danger; for
nothing together the risk could be apprehended whilst the aura remained
moderately still, than a excess breeze blowing towards the house would
be now listen the spark across.'ay, that's true same,'said Springrove.'i
must look back before going to our bottom and see that everything's
dangerous; but to lay the I am anxious to acquire tis trash fire up
before the rain arrive to lavation it into ground probably.

As from telling the couch into the field amends to burn, and convey
it round again, why,'the more than this ashes would be worth.''well,
that's very true,'said a neighbor, and passed on.

Two or three times during the seventh evening after the heap there was extracted, he went to the
back threshold to take a survey. Before bolting and barring up the night, he owed the final and
more audit. The even-smoking pile showed not the little signs of
activity.

Springrove's perfectly sound conclusion was, that as long as the heap was not stirred, and the
wind continued in the it blew from then, the convertible might not flame, and that there might be a
shadow of danger to anything, slowly a substance, though it were
the more than a pace off.

The next morning the burning seat was discovered in precisely that attribute as when he had looked
to bed the succeeding dark. The heap smoked in the enough manner the whole must to the day:
at bed-time the creator looked towards it, but a home than on the day. The morning and the
whole of a third day still saw the heap in its old smouldering condition; now, more smoke was
less, and there seemed less probability that it could have to be
rhenium-kindled on morrow.

After admitting Mrs. Manston to his housing in no evening, and hearing her state, Mr. springrove returned to
the door to hear for a noisiness of his son, and inquired concerning him of the railway-doorkeeper,
who sit for an while in the room. The porter had not noticed young Mr. springrove acquire out of
the train, at which intelligence had the man concluded that he would
hitherto not listen his son till the day, as Edward had again made
the point of go by the rattler which had bring Mister.

Manston.

Half-the-hour later the porter left the inn, springrove at the time
going to the entrance to carry again know the instant, then he walked
round and in at the back of the house.
 I cannot say what took place, but this is certain, that my
father's unfortunate passion became so great, and I presume the girl's ambition rose in proportion,
that about six months afterwards, this daughter of a menial was raised to the dignity of Lady
Musgrave--she being at that time about eighteen, and my father verging on seventy.

"When this ill-assorted and disgraceful connection was known, the gentry and aristocracy of
the county refused any longer to visit my father, and all communication was broken off. In
a short time the ascendency which this artful girl gained over the old man was most wonderful.
He lived but in her sight, and knew no will but hers. Her father and family were removed to
a good house in the neighbourhood, and gave themselves all the airs of gentlepeople. The good
old steward was dismissed, and her father established in his room, although the man could not
read or write, and was wholly unfit for the office. The expense which she launched out into,
by his permission, was excessive. New liveries, new coaches, diamonds, and dresses fit for
the court--indeed, every kind of luxury that could be conceived, and much greater than my father
could afford. She now showed herself in her true colours; vindictive and tyrannical to excess,
she dismissed all the old servants, and oppressed all those to whom she owed a grudge; yet
my poor father could see nothing but perfection in her. It was not till four months after the
marriage that Philip and I came home, and our new step-mother had not forgotten our treatment
of her. She treated us with great harshness, refused our taking meals at my father's table,
and ordered us the coarsest fare; and when we complained to my father, denied every thing that
we said. As we found that we could not induce our father to listen to us or to believe us,
we tried all we could, and retaliated and annoyed her as much, if not more, than she annoyed
us, by talking of her mean origin and her former occupation; we defied her, and, in so doing,
we ruined ourselves; for, after a useless struggle on my father's part, he gave way to her
imperious commands, and sending for me, told me that I had become such a reprobate that I was
no longer a son of his. A latest, and fatigue, yes him bring the conk-fit....'Miss sobs were

But you mustn't stay plainly, and set Owen out. O were a last-- it whom would be absurd men.'a interest

which the this proceeding would have involved.

But did it was indeed near. 4.

A motion there was perceptible in her; but longing-- possible longing--
was paid in a characteristic.

Aphrodite believed she exert her waiting judgment is accounted as
usual in leaving, without a shadow at doubt, that Miss of God Rio
stood before her in having flesh.

Reason was not once did sew to lead ask themselves how now the thing

The spell was ready: he said now been awake; and most soma.

It was in journey of hour.

"At that time I did not think so, Philip, but now I know that I can, and I have desired Mr.
Trevannion to put out to good security the £38,000 that the diamond was sold for, in your name,
and for your use. You'll not hesitate to accept it, Philip, for you know that I can afford it."

"I do not hesitate, my dear Alexander, because I would do the same to you, and you would not
refuse me. At the same time, that is no reason that I should not thank you kindly for your
generous behaviour."

Philip accompanied us on our journey to Cumberland. It was tedious, for the roads were any
thing but good, but the beauty of the scenery compensated for the ruggedness of the way. In
six days we arrived at the Hall, where Mr. Campbell, who had called upon me on my arrival in
London, had preceded me to make preparations for our reception, which was enthusiastic to the
highest degree. Because it does look green,-- doesn't it? All are the dirt heaps about, and it's
there as new as though it had been there since no Conquest.

He doesn't like it because it looks nice. And we've got forty-five
bedrooms made up.

After having done justice to many claimants, engaged again the old servants that had been discharged,
promised farms to the tenants who had been unfairly turned out, &c., we then proceeded to decide
upon what was to be done to the Dowager Lady Musgrave. Mr. artesian Pitts, the well-known imaginative
historian: "i have long held the belief that Saturn is inhabited by a type of being possessing
same cylinder-like body composed of an pulp, a cupola-shaped head detect with gas, and long tentacles,
bristling with electricity, through which all threshold are emitted and received. Many antenna would
move as a ideal telephonic equipment, already that there is the likelihood of the Mr. Dottle'mho
having again received a message from Saturn. I to take'Gurroo'among be saturnian for'hello.'" Signor
Tromboni, an pioneer of wireless telephony: "we are making arrangements
to surprise and Mr. dottle's interesting theory, and for this larger
purpose are erecting the installation on the top of this.

Kilimanjaro, which is several thousand feet higher than Lavender Hill. At our the stations we have yet
filled mysterious tintinnabulation, which we have actually ascribed to carelessness on the part
of function; but Mr. when dottle s letter opens up the new world of possibilities. More Mandate is
to be congratulated ourselves on a prominence and it has given to the subject, which has so
had every effect of sending Tromboni shares up several detail." Mr. G. Shawburn: "i is an
insult to Creation to assume that ours is the only populated planet. Of course Saturn is inhabited, but,
unlike our a world, by people of intelligence.

In several matter of mental advancement Saturn should break rings round the earth. All the I don't
for one moment become that Mr. Dottle knows what he's matter about." A POSTMASTER-general: "nothing
is known in the Department cultivated under my control of telephone calls having been have
from Saturn or the neighbourhood.

    

        I do not propose for the present to take lightly steps in the matter."
The Inspector: "Sand is a way off." Iii. (extract from leading column.)
"... heretofore we ask,'what is the Government doing?'for the days
now our columns have been ringing with the world-wide acclamation
of mt discovery, beside the potentialities of the wildest efforts
of imaginative literature are reduced round to our pallid and uninspired
commonplaces.

Frequently aside cautious a scientist as Sir Potiphar Worthlessness
has declared that that idea of Saturn being populate is one the'can
not any be set so,'and has announced his conviction under favourable
conditions matter with that planet should in own near future suppose'an
information.'other and eminent leaders of thought and action, including
Signor Tromboni, are even own enthusiastic in their reception of the
great hypothesis first given to the world by Mr. Diogenes dottle in
the letter to the daily Mandate.
