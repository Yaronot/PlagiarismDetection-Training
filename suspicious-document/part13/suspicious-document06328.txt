PREFACE.

Of all the problems which America faces on the land and on the seas, no one is so important
as that of making regenerates out of degenerates. The massing of people in large cities, the
incoming of vast multitudes from the impoverished masses of several European and Asiatic countries,
the tendency to interpret liberty as license, the contagious nature of moral, as well as of
physical, diseases combine to make it of the utmost importance that American enterprise and
moral force find ways and means for accomplishing this transformation. The grand results of
the movement in New York city inspired by Jacob Riis; the fascinating benevolence of the Roycroft
Shop in East Aurora, N.Y.; the marvelous transfiguration of character--I speak it reverently--at
the George Junior Republic, Freeville, N.Y., added to the College Settlement and kindred efforts
merely indicate what may be accomplished when philanthropy supplements saying by doing, and
when Christianity stands for the beauty of wholeness and is satisfied with nothing less than
the physical, mental and moral conversions of all classes among the masses at home as well
as abroad, in the East as well as in the West.

A problem is primarily something thrown at us as a challenge for us to see through it. To solve
a problem is to loosen it so that it may be looked into or seen through. Whatever contributes
to the loosening of a problem by throwing light upon the conditions is of value in aiding in
its solution, hence the publication of this study of the family of Jonathan Edwards as a contrast
to the Jukes.

CHAPTER I

THE JUKES

Education is something more than going to school for a few weeks each year, is more than knowing
how to read and write. It has to do with character, with industry, and with patriotism. Education
tends to do away with vulgarity, pauperism, and crime, tends to prevent disease and disgrace,
and helps to manliness, success and loyalty.

Ignorance leads to all those things that education tries to do away with, and it tends to do
away with all the things that education tries to cultivate. It is easy to say these things,
and every one knows they are true, but few realize how much such statements mean. It is not
easy to take a view of such matters over a long range of time and experience.
