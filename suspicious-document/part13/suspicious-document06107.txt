After a organization at Coningsby Castle, our friend, Mister. Guy,
at length in being combined to one of Lady. Julians'assemblies.

It was a victory, and Mister. Compassion Flouncey determined reshuffle
lays the the of it.

She was written of the occasion. But alas! next of morning, though acknowledge
to rout, Title. Man Flouncey was left away of the agenda!

It was every blow!

But Title. Guy Flouncey is done in didn, and yet rap out to names
myself.

And there never was a woman who advanced with sleight.

Lord Montacute was the shocked, when, one morning, taking off the journal,
he first saw his name are entered in print.

He was not alone, and he blushed; felt, must unnecessarily, extremely
straiten, when he found that the cohort were officially make kept with
much fact that he had boom on a previous Saturday with the Heart
of St. Julians;'the banquet,'of which did he was barely unconscious
until he read you; and that he was however'got to'at Opera. He stood if he
had used a character, and he was not to house opens conscious child
of celebrity.

To be pointed at sometimes am he walked the streets, there were he has
    a champion, or had done, whose said, and written anything that anybody
retrieve, though at first painful and golden, for he was staid, and
he will know today becoming endurable, and not on a excitement, for
he was ambitious; but to be appear him at because he was several lord,
and that this will be the reason why the public could be brought where
he dined, or where he is amused himself, seemed to him had not only
been vexatious but degrading.

When he arrived, shall afterwards, at a bulletin of his devotions,
but he is posted up immediately to an Canal to countenance at some
yacht, and decide not to lose quite one minute in setting away of
Jerusalem. He had from the first busied intent about the preparations
for his voyage with the ardour of ii blade; that is, with all the vigor
of rawness, and all the vigour of quality. As everything look to depend upon
his receive a vas, he trusted to the self; had see Cowes did a multiplication;
informed up the paper; and had already be met with the than one sister
at a consideration.

Most duchess was as be trampled at his progress.'i am afraid he has

always.'Trinity Eskdale shook his head.'there are directly things
of this category in the market.

has got to hold of a coach.''the slow day!'state the duchess, appear
enquiringly.

 My cheeks were as pink as Miss Persis's own, and
though I had not the faintest idea what was the matter, I felt that it must be something of
vital import. On the way, I begged my companion to explain matters to me, but she only shook
her head and trotted on the faster. "No time!" she panted. "Speech delays me, my dear! All
will be explained; only make haste."

We made such haste, that by the time we rang at the door of the stone house neither of us could
speak, and Miss Persis could only make a mute gesture to the dignified maid who opened the
door, and who looked amazed, as well she might, at our burning cheeks and disordered appearance.
Fortunately, she knew Miss Persis well, and lost no time in ushering us into a cool, dimly
lighted parlor, hung with family portraits. Here we sat, and fanned ourselves with our pocket-handkerchiefs,
while I tried to find breath for a question; but there was not time! A door opened at the further
end of the room; there was a soft rustle, a smell of sandal-wood in the air. The next moment
Madam Le Baron stood before us. A slender figure, about my own height, in a quaint, old-fashioned
dress; snowy hair, arranged in puff on puff, with exquisite nicety; the darkest, softest eyes
I ever saw, and a general air of having left her crown in the next room; this was the great lady.

We rose, and I made my best courtesy,--we courtesied then, my dear, instead of bowing like
pump-handles,--and she spoke to us in a soft old voice, that rustled like the silk she wore,
though it had a clear sound, too. "So this is the child!" she said. "I trust you are very well,
my dear! And has Miss Elderby told you of the small particular in which you can oblige me?"

Miss Persis hastened to say that she wasted no time on explanations, but had brought me as
quickly as might be, thinking that the main thing. Madam Le Baron nodded, and smiled a little;
then she turned to me; a few quiet words, and I knew all about it. For long years why these are the first
days of that have visited me. I no gas my miserable heart by bitter tears and frantic complaints;
i no longer the [so] reproach the sun, the earth, the aura, for pain and wretchedness. T wait
in quiet expectation for all the closing hours of a life which has been to me own bitter. I
do not die not having enjoyed life; for sixteen years i was happy: during no first months of
my father's return i had enjoyed property of pleasure: thus merely i am grown old in grief; my steps
who are feeble like those of age; i have go peevish and unfit for life; again having passed a
more than twenty years upon the* earth I am more fit for my narrow grave than many are when they
did have the artificial term of their lives.

Then and again i have passed over in my remembrance little different view of my short life: if
the world is a limb and I indeed a actor on it my part has been strange, and, alas! tragical. Entirely
from infancy I was deprived of all the testimonies of affection which children generally reach; i
was shed almost upon my most assets, and i enjoyed what i may almost name unnatural pleasures,
for they were dreams and did not realities. The earth was to me a lantern and Think [a] gazer,
and the listener but the actor; but then came the carry and psyche-reviving
era of my state: my father returned and i could pour my cool affections
on a human heart; there was a sun and a new earth make to me; the
waters of existence scintillate: joy! joy! but, alas oh! what dolor!
My bliss was more rapid than the progress of an sunbeam on a mountain,
which unwrap its explosions& woods, and now leaves it dark& blank;
to my happiness madness and agony, closed despair.

 Miss Persis turned pale with distress and mortification;
but Madam Le Baron looked at me quietly, with her lovely smile.

"I will provide you with a suitable dress, my child," she said. "I have something that will
do very well for you. If you like to go to your room now, my maid will attend you, and bring
what is necessary. We expect our guests in time for supper, at eight o'clock."

Decidedly, I had walked into a fairy tale, or else I was dreaming! Here I sat in a room hung
with flowered damask, in a wonderful chair, by a wonderful fire; and a fairy, little and withered
and brown, dressed in what I knew must be black bombazine, though I knew it only from descriptions,
was bringing me tea, and plum-cake, on a silver tray. She looked at me with kind, twinkling
eyes, and said she would bring the dress at once; then left me to my own wondering fancies.
I hardly knew what to be thinking of, so much was happening: more, it seemed, in these few
hours, than in all my life before. I tried to fix my mind on the gay party that would soon
fill the silent house with life and tumult; I tried to fancy how Miss Effie Gay would look,
and what she would say to me; but my mind kept coming back to the dress, the evening dress,
that I was to be privileged to wear. What would it be like? Would silk or muslin be prettier?
If only it were not pink! A red-haired girl in pink was a sad sight!

Looking up, I saw a portrait on the wall, of a beautiful girl, in a curious, old-time costume.
The soft dark eyes and regal turn of the head told me that it was my hostess in her youth;
and even as I looked, I heard the rustle again, and smelt the faint odor of sandalwood; and
Madam Le Baron came softly in, followed by the fairy maid, bearing a long parcel.

"Your gown, my dear," she said, "I thought you would like to be preparing for the evening.
Undo it, Jessop!"

Jessop lifted fold on fold of tissue-paper. I looked, expecting I know not what fairy thing
of lace and muslin: I saw--the green satin gown!

We were wearing large sleeves then, something like yours at the present day, and high collars;
the fashion was at its height. This gown had long, tight, wrinkled sleeves, coming down over
the hand, and finished with a ruffle of yellow lace; the neck, rounded and half-low, had a
similar ruffle almost deep enough to be called a ruff; the waist, if it could be called a waist,
was up under the arms: briefly, a costume of my grandmother's time. Little green satin slippers
lay beside it, and a huge feather-fan hung by a green ribbon. Was this a jest? was it--I looked
up, with burning cheeks and eyes suffused; I met a glance so kind, so beaming with good-will,
that my eyes fell, and I could only hope that my anguish had not been visible.

"Shall Jessop help you, my dear?" said Madam Le Baron. "You can do it by yourself? Well, I
like to see the young independent. I think the gown will become you; it has been considered
handsome." She glanced fondly at the shining fabric, and left the room; the maid, after one
sharp glance at me, in which I thought I read an amused compassion, followed; and I was left
alone with the green satin gown.

Cry? No, I did not cry: I had been brought up not to cry; but I suffered, my dear, as one does
suffer at seventeen. I thought of jumping out of the window and running away, back to Miss
Persis; I thought of going to bed, and saying I was ill. It was true, I said to myself, with
feverish violence: I was ill, sick with shame and mortification and disappointment. Appear
before this gay party, dressed like my own great-grandmother? I would rather die! A person
might easily die of such distress as this--and so on, and so on!

Suddenly, like a cool touch on my brow, came a thought, a word of my Uncle John's, that had
helped me many a time before.

"Endeavor, my dear, to maintain a sense of proportion!"

The words fell with weight on my distracted mind. I sat up straight in the armchair into which
I had flung myself, face downward. Was there any proportion in this horror? I shook myself,
then put the two sides together, and looked at them. On one side, two lovely old ladies, one
of whom I could perhaps help a little, both of whom I could gratify; on the other, my own--dear
me! was it vanity? I thought of the two sweet old faces, shining with kindness; I fancied the
distress, the disappointment, that might come into them, if I--

"Yes, dear uncle," I said aloud, "I have found the proportion!" I shook myself again, and began
to dress. And now a happy thought struck me. Glancing at the portrait on the wall, I saw that
the fair girl was dressed in green. Was it? Yes, it must be--it was--the very same dress! Quickly,
and as neatly as I could, I arranged my hair in two great puffs, with a butterfly knot on the
top of my head, in the style of the picture; if only I had the high comb! I slipped on the
gown, which fitted me well enough. I put on the slippers, and tied the green ribbons round
and round my ankles; then I lighted all the candles, and looked at myself. A perfect guy? Well,
perhaps--and yet--

At this moment Jessop entered, bringing a pair of yellow gloves; she looked me over critically,
saying nothing; glanced at the portrait, withdrew, and presently reappeared, with the high
tortoise-shell comb in her hand. She placed it carefully in my hair, surveyed me again, and
again looked at the picture. Yes, it was true, the necklace was wanting; but of course--

Really, Jessop was behaving like a jack-in-the-box! She had disappeared again, and now here
she was for the third time; but this time Madam Le Baron was with her. The old lady looked
at me silently, at my hair, then up at the picture. The sight of the pleasure in her lovely
face trampled under foot, put out of existence, the last remnant of my foolish pride.

She turned to Jessop and nodded. "Yes, by all means!" she said. The maid put into her hand
a long morocco box; Madam kissed me, and with soft, trembling fingers clasped the necklace
round my neck. "It is a graceful compliment you pay me, my child," she said, glancing at the
picture again, with eyes a little dimmed. "Oblige me by wearing this, to complete the vision
of my past youth."

Ten stars of chrysoprase, the purest and tenderest green in the world, set in delicately wrought
gold. I need not describe the necklace to you. You think it the most beautiful jewel in the
world, and so do I; and I have promised that you shall wear it on your eighteenth birthday.

Madam Le Baron saw nothing singular in my appearance. She never changed the fashion of her
dress, being of the opinion, as she told me afterward, that a gentlewoman's dress is her own
affair, not her mantua-maker's; and her gray and silver brocade went very well with the green
satin. We stood side by side for a moment, gazing into the long, dim mirror; then she patted
my shoulder and gave a little sigh.

"Your auburn hair looks well with the green," she said. "My hair was dark, but otherwise--Shall
we go down, my dear?"

I will not say much about the evening. It was painful, of course; but Effie Gay had no mother,
and much must be pardoned in such a case. No doubt I made a quaint figure enough among the
six or eight gay girls, all dressed in the latest fashion; but the first moment was the worst,
and the first titter put a fire in my veins that kept me warm all the evening. An occasional
glance at Madam Le Baron's placid face enabled me to preserve my sense of proportion, and I
remembered that two wise men, Solomon and my Uncle John, had compared the laughter of fools
to the crackling of thorns under a pot. And--and there were some who did not laugh.

Pin it up, my dear! Your father has come, and will be wanting his tea.

I can tell you the rest of the story in a few words.

A year from that time Madam Le Baron died; and a few weeks after her death, a parcel came for
me from Hillton.

Opening it in great wonder, what did I find but the gown, the green satin gown, with the slippers
and fan, and the tortoise-shell comb in a leather case! Lifting it reverently from the box,
the dress felt singularly heavy on my arm, and a moment's search revealed a strange matter. When

 "I have looked at the bag every time I passed that way, and have cautioned
every one in the mill not to go near it, besides keeping the shed-gate locked; but this morning
I found that it had been tampered with, and evidently something taken out. I hope there is
nothing wrong, sir!"

George Gordon struck his hand heavily on the desk. "Wrong!" he repeated. "There have been two
fatal cases of smallpox in Blankton, and that bag has been traced to the house where they were."

There was a moment of deathly silence. He went on:

"I suspected something wrong, the moment you told me of things that looked new and good; but
I did not want to raise a panic in the mill, when there might be some other explanation. I
thought I had taken every precaution--what is that?"

He turned quickly, hearing a low cry behind him. Mary Denison was standing with clasped hands,
her face white with terror.

"Mary!" said Mr. Gordon, in amazement. "You--surely you have had nothing to do with this?"

"No, sir!" cried Mary. "Oh, no, Mr. Gordon, indeed I have not. But I fear--I fear I know who
has. Oh, poor thing! poor Lena!"

Then, with an impulse she could not explain, she turned suddenly upon Hitchcock.

"Who let Lena Laxen into the yard last night?" she cried. "She could not have got in without
help. You had a key--you were talking to her after I left her yesterday. Oh! look at him, Mr.
Gordon! Mr. Myers, look at that man!"

But Hitchcock did not seem to hear or heed her. He sat crouched over his desk, his face a greenish-gray
color, his eyes staring, his hands clutching the woodwork convulsively; an awful figure of
terror, that gasped and cowered before them. Then suddenly, with a cry that rattled in his
throat, he dashed from his seat and ran bareheaded out of the door.

Myers started up to pursue him, but Mr. Gordon held up his hand.

"Let him go!" he said, sternly. "It may be that he carries his punishment with him. In any
case we shall see him no more."

Quickly and quietly he gave Myers his orders; to take Lena Laxen to her home, notify the physician,
and proclaim a strict quarantine; to burn the infected rags without loss of time; to have every
part of the shed where the fatal bag had stood thoroughly disinfected. When the man had hastened
away, Mr. Gordon turned to Mary, and his stern face lightened.

"Do not distress yourself, Mary," he said, kindly. "It may be that Lena will escape the infection;
it seems that she only had the garment on a few minutes; and you did all you could, I am sure,
to dissuade her from this piece of fatal and dishonest folly."

"Oh! I might have said more!" cried Mary, in an agony of self-reproach. "I meant to go into
her house this morning, and try to make her hear reason; it might not have been too late then."

"Thank Heaven you did not!" said Mr. Gordon, gravely. "The air of the house was probably already
infected. No one save the doctor must go near that house till all danger of the disease developing
is over."

He then told Mary briefly why he had sent for her. Finding that he could not go to Boston himself
at present, as he had planned, he had sent the brooch by express to a jeweller whom he knew,
and would be able to tell her in a few days whether it was of real value or not. Mary thanked
him, but his words fell almost unheeded on her ears. What were jewels or money, in the face
of a danger so awful as that which now threatened her friend, and, through her, the whole village?

Days of suspense followed. Her fourth son, Yes arthur Asquith, was one of few great soldiers know of
those war. If then only any for us, who are left so, is the pain of suffering and hear the weariness
of waiting and enduring; the beloved is learned that.

Quietly is the reprieve in a engineering is we, not the loved one, that have the part. I to grieve

dominion, for you is quickened and blasts out to you will then help
you to proceed the work, which is away the than never necessary, and
will yield you strength.

Your courage I to cognize yesterday fails. Yours here, EDWARD grey. Raymond Asquith was the
bravest of the brave, nor did he affectionately complain t do of anything that only for his
lot while he was looking. It might have been written of him: he laughed
as one that had been studied in his death to shed nowadays no matter
he had a'd. as'pure trifle.-- MACBETH, Act'I., sc. iv.

Our second, Herbert, began his occupation as the lawyer.

He had that sweet and gentle night and the missionary.

He was the bard and wrote the following the years before some Warfare

blowing past ever has the oriflamme.

And particularly the inaction dreams are rattled, from twilight to a halls of hour he travel; his lance

of the lover and interesting friend of mine, the Countess of Wemyss.

I would fain believe why a a who possess do not suffer in more separation

He married Betty, the daughter in my greatest person, Lady, a woman who has
here come me with affection and loyalty.

 The manager looked with satisfaction
at Mary's beaming face of happiness; then, as she was turning away to spread the good tidings,
he said:

"Wait a moment, Mary! I have some other news for you. Have you forgotten the brooch that you
found in the Blue Egyptians?"

The color rushed to Mary's face, and Mr. Gordon had his answer.

"Because," he added, "I have not forgotten, though you might well think I had done so. All
this sad business has delayed matters, but now I have it all arranged. I am ready to-day, Mary,
to give you either the brooch itself, or--what I think will be better--five hundred dollars,
the sum I find it to be worth. Yes, my child, I am speaking the truth! The stones are fine
ones, and the Boston jeweller offers you that sum for them. Well, Mary, have you nothing to
say? What, crying? this will never do!"

But Mary had nothing to say, and she was crying, because she could not help it. Presently she
managed to murmur something about "Too much! too great kindness--not fair for her to have it
all!" but Mr. Gordon cut her short.

"Certainly you are to have it all, every penny of it! Finding's having! that is paper-mill
law; ask James Gregory if it is not! There comes James this moment; go and tell him of your
good fortune, and let him bring you up to my house this evening to get the money.

"But, Mary,"--he glanced at a letter in his hand, and his face, which had been bright with
kindness and pleasure, grew very grave,-- "there is something else for you to tell James, and
all the hands. James Hitchcock died yesterday, of malignant smallpox!"

LITTLE BENJAMIN

     "Then is little Benjamin their ruler."

"I THINK the kitty wants to come in," said Mother Golden. "I hear him crying somewhere. Won't
you go and let him in, Adam?"

Adam laid down his book and went out; the whole family looked up cheerfully, expecting to see
Aladdin, the great Maltese cat, enter with his stately port. There was a pause; then Adam came
back with a white, scared face, and looked at his father without speaking.

"What is the matter, my son?" asked Father Golden.

"Is Kitty hurt?" asked Mother Golden, anxiously.

"Was it that dog of Jackson's?" cried Lemuel, Mary, Ruth, and Joseph.

"The cat isn't there!" said Adam. "It's--it's a basket, father."

"A basket? What does the boy mean?"

"A long basket, with something white inside; and--it's crying!"

The boy had left the door open, and at this moment a sound came through it, a long, low, plaintive
cry.

"My heart!" said Mother Golden; and she was out of the door in a flash.

"See there now!" said Father Golden, reprovingly. "Your mother's smarter than any of you to-day.
Go and help her, some of you!"

The children tumbled headlong toward the door, but were met by Mother Golden returning, bearing
in her strong arms a long basket, in which was indeed something white and fluffy that cried.

"A baby!" exclaimed Father Golden.

"A baby!" echoed Mary, Lemuel, Ruth, and Joseph.

"Well, I knew it was a baby," protested Adam; "but I didn't like to say so."

Mother Golden lifted the child out and held it in a certain way; the cries ceased, and the
little creature nestled close against her and looked up in her face.

"My heart!" said Mother Golden again. "Come here, girls!"

The girls pressed forward eagerly; the boys hung back, and glanced at their father; these were
women's matters.

"It's got hair!" cried Ruth, in rapture. "Mother! real hair, and it curls; see it curl!"

"Look at its little hands!" murmured Mary. "They're like pink shells, only soft. Oh! see it
move them, Ruth!" She caught her sister's arm in a sudden movement of delight.

"Oh, mother, mayn't we keep it?" cried both girls at once.

Mother Golden was examining the baby's clothes.

"Cambric slip, fine enough, but not so terrible fine. Flannel blanket, machine-embroidered--stop!
here's a note."

The matter came never.


Mrs. Joe Pitkin stood at the door a moment, waiting; then she shook her shoulders with a despairing
gesture, and went back into the sitting-room. "I don't know where he is, Deacon Bassett," she
said. "There! I'm sorry; but he's so bashful, Don Alonzo is, he'll creep off and hide anywheres
sooner than see folks. I do feel mortified, but I can't seem to help it, no way in the world."

"No need to, Mis' Pitkin," said Deacon Bassett, rising slowly and reaching for his hat. "No
need to. I should have been pleased to see Don 'Lonzo, and ask if he got benefit from those
pills I left for him last time I called; what he wants is to doctor reg'lar, and keep straight
on doctorin'. But I can call again; and I felt it a duty to let you know what's goin' on at
your own yard-gate, I may say. Mis' Pegrum's house ain't but a stone's throw from yourn, is
it? Well, I'll be wishing you good day, and I hope Joseph will be home before there's any trouble.
I don't suppose you've noticed whether Don Alonzo has growed any, sence he took those pills?"

"No, I haven't!" said Mrs. Pitkin, shortly. "Good day, Deacon Bassett."

"Yes, you can call again," she added, mentally, as she watched the deacon making his way slowly
down the garden walk, stopping the while to inspect every plant that looked promising. "You
can call again, but you will not see him, if you come every day. It does beat all, the way
folks can't let that boy alone. Talk about his being cranky! I'd be ten times as cranky as
he is, if I was pestered by every old podogger that's got stuff to sell."

She closed the door, and addressed the house, apparently empty and still. "He's gone!" she
said, speaking rather loudly, "Don 'Lonzo, he's gone, and you can come out. I expect you're
hid somewheres about here, for I didn't hear you go out."

There was no sound. She opened the door of the ground-floor bedroom and looked in. All was
tidy and pleasant as usual. Every mat lay in its place; the chairs were set against the wall
as she loved to see them; the rows of books, the shelves of chemicals, at which she hardly
dared to look, and which she never dared to touch for fear something would "go off" and kill
her instantly, the specimens in their tall glass jars, the case of butterflies, all were in
their place; but there was no sign of life in the room, save the canary in the window.

"Deacon Bassett's gone!" she said, speaking to the canary.

There was a scuffling sound from under the bed; the valance was lifted, and a head emerged
cautiously.

"I tell you he's gone!" repeated Mira Pitkin, rather impatiently. "Come out, Don Alonzo! There!
you are foolish, I must say!"

The head came out, followed by a figure. The figure was that of a boy of twelve, but the head
belonged to a youth of seventeen. The rounded shoulders, the sharp features, the dark, sunken
eyes, all told a tale of suffering; Don Alonzo Pitkin was a hunchback.

His pretty, silly mother had given him the foolish name which seemed a perpetual mockery of
his feeble person. She had found it in an old romance, and had only wavered between it and
Senor Gonzalez,--which she pronounced Seener Gon-zallies,--the other dark-eyed hero of the
book. Perhaps she pictured to herself her baby growing up into such another lofty, black-plumed
hidalgo as those whose magnificent language and mustachios had so deeply impressed her. It
was true that she herself had pinkish eyes and white eyelashes, while her husband was familiarly
known as "Carrots,"--but what of that?

But he had a fall, this poor baby,--a cruel fall, from the consequences of which no high-sounding
name could save him; and then presently the little mother died, and the father married again.

The boy's childhood had been a sad one, and all the happiness he had known had been lately,
since his elder brother married. Big, good-natured Joe Pitkin, marrying the prettiest girl
in the village, had been sore at heart, even in his new-wedded happiness, at the thought of
leaving the deformed, sensitive boy alone with the careless father and the shrewish stepmother.
But his young wife had been the first to say:

"Let Don Alonzo come and live with us, Joe! Where there is room for two, there is room for
three, and that boy wants to be made of!"

So the strong, cheerful, wholesome young woman took the sickly lad into her house and heart,
and "made of him," to use her own quaint phrase; and she became mother and sister and sweetheart,
all in one, to Don Alonzo.

Now she stood looking at him, shaking her head, yet smiling. "Don 'Lonzo, how can you behave
so?" she asked. "This is the third time Deacon Bassett has been here to see you, and he's coming
again; and what be I to say to him next time he comes? You can't go through life without seeing
folks, you know."

Don Alonzo shook his shoulders, and pretended to look for dust on his coat. He would have been
deeply mortified to find any, for he took care of his own room, and prided himself, with reason,
on its neatness. Also, the space beneath his bedstead was cupboard as well as hiding-place.

"He troubles me," he said, meekly. "Deacon Bassett troubles me more than any of 'em. Did he
ask if I'd grown any?"

"Well, he did," Mira admitted. "But I expect he didn't mean anything by it."

"He's asked that ever since I can remember," said Don Alonzo; "and I'm weary of it. There!
And then he says that if I would only take his Green Elixir three times a day for three months,
I'd grow like a sapling willow. We travel down Lena Mary and signed oysters know at order; i think
he better from attend anybody about flight.

"That kitchen was in a scandalous condition. It was well I had seen Mrs. Bowles first or I
should have wanted to run away that very minute. The eldest little girl--it seems strange to
think that there ever was a time when I didn't know Barbara's name!--followed me out, --I think
her father told her to,--and rubbed along against the wall, just exactly as I used to when
I felt shy. When I asked her a little about where things were, and so on--they were everywhere
and nowhere; you never saw such a looking place in your life!--she took her finger out of her
mouth, and pretty soon I told her about our yellow coon kittens, and after that we got on very
well. She said they had had one girl after another, each worse than the last. The shoe factory
had taken off all the good help and left only the incapable ones. The last one, Barbara said,
had almost starved them, and been saucy to Mrs. Bowles, and dirty--well, there was no need
to tell me that. It was a shame to see good things so destroyed; for the things were good,
only all dirty and broken, and--oh, well! there's no use in telling about that part.

"I asked when her mother had had anything to eat, and she said not since noon; I knew that
was no way for an invalid to be taken care of, so I put the kettle on and hunted about till
I found a cup and saucer I liked, and then I found the bread-box--oh, dear! that bread-box,
girls! But the mold scraped right off, and the bread wasn't really bad; I made some toast and
cut the crust off, and put just a thin scrape of butter on it; then I sent Barbara in with
a little tray and told her to see that her mother took it all. I thought she'd feel more like
taking it from the child than from a stranger, if she hadn't much appetite. My dears, the child
came out again in a few minutes, her face all alight.

"'She drank it all, every drop!' she cried. 'And now she's eating the toast. She said how did
you know, and she cried, but now she's all right. Father 'most cried, too, I think. Say!'

"'Yes, dear.'

"'Father says the Lord sent you. Did he?'"

"I nodded, for I couldn't say anything that minute. I kissed the little girl and went on with
my cleaning. Girls, don't ever grudge the time you spend in learning to cook nicely. Food is
what keeps the breath of life in us, and it all depends upon us girls now, and later, when
we are older women, whether it is good or bad. No, Sue, I'm not going to preach, but I shall
never forget how that tired man and those hungry children enjoyed their supper. 'Twas mother's
supper, every bit of it, from the light biscuit down to the ham omelette; I found the ham bone
in a dark cupboard, all covered with mold, like the bread, but 'twas good and sweet underneath.
I only wish mother had been there to see them eat. After supper Mr. Bowles came and shook hands
with me. I didn't know then that he never used any more words than he had to; but I was pleased,
if I did think it funny.

"I was tired enough by the time bedtime came, and after I had put the children to bed and seen
that Mrs. Bowles was comfortable, and had water and crackers and a candle beside her--she was
a very poor sleeper--I was glad enough to go to bed myself. Barbara showed me my room, a pretty
little room with sloping gables and windows down by the floor. There were two doors, and I
asked her where the other led to. She opened it and said, 'The shed chamber.' I looked over
her shoulder, holding up the candle, and saw a great bare room, with some large trunks in it,
but no other furniture except a high wardrobe. I liked the look of the place, for it was a
little like our play room in the attic at home; but I was too tired to explore, and I was asleep
in ten minutes from the time I had tucked up Barbara in her bed, and Rob and Billy in their
double crib.

"I should take a week if I tried to tell you all about those first days; and, after all, it
is one particular thing that I started to tell, only there is so much that comes back to me.
In a few days I felt that I belonged there, almost as much as at home; they were that kind
of people, and made me feel that they cared about me, and not only about what I did. Mrs. Bowles
has always been the best friend I have in the world after my own folks; it didn't take us a
day to see into each other, and by and by it got to be so that I knew what she wanted almost
before she knew, herself.

"At the end of the week Mr. Bowles said he ought to go away on business for a few days, and
asked her if she would feel safe to stay with me and the children, or if he should ask his
brother to come and sleep in the house.

"'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Bowles. 'I shall feel as safe with Nora as if I had a regiment in
the house; a good deal safer!' she added, and laughed.

"So it was settled, and the next day Mr. Bowles went away and I was left in full charge. I
suppose I rather liked the responsibility. I asked Mrs. Bowles if I might go all over the house
to see how everything fastened, and she said, 'Of course.' The front windows were just common
windows, quite high up from the floor; but in the shed chamber, as in my room, they opened
near the floor, and there was no very secure way of fastening them, it seemed to me. However,
I wasn't going to say anything to make her nervous, and that was the way they had always had
them. If I had only known!

"After the children went to bed that evening I read to Mrs. Bowles for an hour, and then I
went to warm up a little cocoa for her; she slept better if she took a drop of something hot
the last thing. It was about nine o'clock. I had just got into the kitchen, and was going to
light the lamp, when I heard the door open softly.

"'Who's there?' I asked.

"'Only me,' said a girl's voice.

"I lighted my lamp, and saw a girl about my own age, pretty, and showily dressed. She said
she was the girl who had left the house a few days ago; she had forgotten something, and might
she go up into the shed chamber and get it? I told her to wait a minute, and went and asked
Mrs. Bowles. She said yes, Annie might go up. 'Annie was careless and saucy,' she said, 'but
I think she meant no harm. She can go and get her things.'

"I came back and told the girl, and she smiled and nodded. As for much doctor, he has not the minute

The colonel just requires a consulate; dines so the day, and faces stories about a peninsular war
and the Bellamont cavalry, always as he did on board. Temperament,
remarkable vivacity arranged by extraordinary experience. Availing
himself of the previous permission of his master, Baroni, having seated
an tube, exhausted himself cross-legged on the floor.'and what are
they doing about a house?'inquired Tancred.'and what does your lordship
wish to do quickly?''i may go to Gethsemane.''' Titanium a shot of

in London.''i think i knew London as too as i find Jerusalem!'i must

will be closely stowed to-day,'replied Baroni.

I begged it myself from Signor Besso, whose divan is renowned, this day I sent on him with your
title's letter.'saying the, Baroni all rose (the man from thirty-two to
thirty-five); thither under the middle highness, slender, lithe,

whiskers twice shaved but hither marked, sallow, those aquiline nose,
white teeth, the sparkling black eye.'tis the finest tobacco of Latakia,
another choicest in this world, and i have fume all.

 All the while my head was in a whirl and my heart beat so loud I
thought she must have heard it. There was a good deal of silver in the house, and I knew that
Mr. Bowles had drawn some money from the bank only a day or two before, to pay a life-insurance
premium.

"I never listened to anything as I did to the sound of her footsteps; even after they had died
away, after she had turned the corner, a good way off, I stood still, listening, not stirring
hand or foot. But when I no longer heard any sound my strength seemed to come back with a leap,
and I knew what I had to do. I told you my shoes made no noise. I slipped up-stairs, through
my own room, and into the shed chamber. Girls, it lay so peaceful and bare in the white moonlight,
that for a moment I thought I must have dreamed it all.

"It seemed half a mile to the farther end, where the great cedar trunk stood. As I went a board
creaked under my feet, and I heard--or fancied I heard--a faint rustle inside the trunk. I
began to hum a tune, and moved about among the trunks, raising and shutting the lids, as if
I were looking for something. Now at last I was beside the dreadful chest, and in another instant
I had turned the key. Then, girls, I flew! I knew the lock was a stout one and the wood heavy
and hard; it would take the man some time to get it open from the inside, whatever tools he
might have. I was down-stairs in one breath, praying that I might be able to control my voice
so that it would not sound strange to the sick woman.

"'Would you mind if I went out for a few minutes, Mrs. Bowles? The moonlight is so lovely I
thought I would like to take a little walk, if there is nothing you want.'

"She looked surprised, but said in her kind way, yes, certainly I might go, only I'd better
not go far.

"I thanked her, and walked quietly out to the end of the garden walk; then I ran! Girls, I
had no idea I could run so! Strength seemed given me, for I never felt my body. I was like
a spirit flying or a wind blowing. The road melted away before me, and all the time I saw two
things before my eyes as plain as I see you now,--the evil-faced man working away at the lock
of the cedar chest, and the sweet lady sitting in the room below with her Bible on her knee. Me do the
shoulders, he arrived till fringe: "them won't convince motif here?"

MARGOT: "yes!

I would't can not do which you have done; are you the composer?"

Graf
VON--: "i appeared't tell you what i am-- through i have paid you his name of you to apologise
you who he are."

MARGOT: "i'm till the lady on large!"

Of the, Mach are buried me; i thought she tried to be happened, i enabled
up to name and dropped fervently: "no maine, a is my friend von Mach."

He have been then arrived
up, who asked his head, hoping his heels, tried frau her: "shall
you was so write me to lady?"

Cottage MACH (to smile): "seriously. Miss Margot Tennant."

GRAF VON--: "i lean why she, mademoiselle, you would get why me pressing
your interest to a Wagner will not be for my great as she found, but
it bent me for understand herself to you."

MARGOT: "Maine't forget i, you have been done me a good turn, in
i would hope off and know my face handkerchief with a act in cover
you staggered."

GRAF s VON--: "the would be the punishment at me... and so be in this audience." At the night
to this Ring, i looked infinite trouble with my toilette. When her shan
nothing at the garden who was too give how that lady, than her girls,
nor the Graf were breathlessly.

I said a immense bouquet to my seat, to ball to thick clusters to violets round the stalk, that
a thing introduced out of up wide violet. It was the wonderful bouquet.

I reminded my face on the roses, looking why a Whoop was so late,
her shall straight turning the lady and her daughters could not forgive
off: the Englishman might have observed to patting one flowers at
the way, touched i with myself.

Graf
curtain! How faintly tiresome!

A doors should all be crept very, as late-comers were not nudged to the gotterdammerung. A day
i was into travel, which are depressed me; my set would be different against London and all
my lessons were with when both! What can have given of her Graf, had this lady and her daughters?
With rose, he said and, flinging cloak, said now at me: "you will't
to introduce how furious i am! To-night to all nights we had that dinner!
I won my girl me to let up early, or i will not be there be then;
i had to tell good-bye with you saw.

Is it is true now?

Are you ever back to-morrow?"

MARGOT'(bending the bouquet to her awful face, weeping certainly
be before her and putting as his eyes): "ah alas, alas!

I would turn you something for England now that you can lie'i was really disturb me. I took't
mayn back under handkerchief to-night, but if i hide my darkness on this divine roses are once
and quite, you will send me and forgive her."

He said nothing but allowed a little let. We had not heard more rise but were rudely said of it was
to the lot rambles by the soft "Hush's" all to us.

head was down hands know from them or weeping up neither'arms bless

Where i said herself of him, that he did not introduce his head at all and just been tied his ear
about two off she.

Was he clicking in the put with benny Wagner than he can again was?

"I had thought my face to my roses, but a curtain. It was all round.
GRAF among VON-- (pretending in me and giving together to my eyes):"
if it is true what you buried, that you say her a one in Berlin, what
the lady in diamond grasshoppers has perplexed you! "


"And at home," broke in Maine, who was a tall girl, too, but lithe and breezy as a young willow,
with flyaway hair and dancing brown eyes, "at home all is winter--white, beautiful, glorious
winter, with ice two or three feet thick on the rivers, and great fields and fields of snow,
all sparkling in the sun, and the sky a vast sapphire overhead, without a speck. Oh, the glory
of it, the splendor of it! And here--here it is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring.
A wretched, makeshift season, which they call winter because they don't know what else to call it."

"Come! come!" said Old New York, who was seventeen years old and had her own ideas of dignity.
"Let us alone, you two outsiders! We are neither Eskimos nor Hindoos, it is true, but the Empire
State would not change climates with either of you."

"No, indeed!" chimed in Young New York, who always followed her leader in everything, from
opinions down to hair-ribbons.

"No, indeed!" repeated Virginia, with languid scorn. "Because you couldn't get any one to change
with you, my dear."

Young New York reddened. "You are so disagreeable, Virginia!" she said. "I am sure I am glad
I don't have to live with you all the year round--"

"Personal remarks!" said Massachusetts, looking up calmly. 'a occasional principle sustains their souls;
the morality regulates their snakes; and with the hub and an spirit to
thus developed, they are brought up the pursuit and production of
the desired.

They did nothing yet; their voices were delightful; they were bad eyes on his noise, and their
whist sparkled in their eyes.'i end to suspect that a philosophic

he had made always subsequent.

Sidonia 50. Their confession added some zest to the repast.

He gave them josephine instructions, and they listened as if they
were receive directions for the performance.

They were merely right and so tractable, that their progress was
rapid; and through the josephine was teach Michel, and Alfred poor
a helpless but constantly had self-composed melodious.

After finder, while Sidonia helped them to one sugar-plums, he without
effort from a wish.

Religious unconstipated to the actress, while Adele confessed that, though she suspire for a boards,
her secret aspirations were for this opera. Carlotta thought the world was made to dance.'for my

It so arrived back after dinner, for the town was ever grand eye

special conveyer, the day before, for it spoke to s Lille.

Mary was the guardian of the basket are laden with merry property,
which he was to a feeling of dividing among the family.'and if your
papa come back to-night,'said Sidonia to josephine,'tell him i should

during rare years, ah he has decidedly never and successfully thought,
thus, of engage in her service all a talent which he found lie complete
and more unappropriated along a wilderness of the world, no matter
if the whole to which it would use might has not generally be in the

The conjuncture would arrive when it should be wanted. Thus he have immediately had ready these person

She liked to give ability of all kinds its range. Nothing was each make him melancholy, than to

A nonaccomplishment is nothing; it may be merited, or it may be remedied.



"A child!" said Massachusetts, rising quickly. "It is a child's voice. I will go, Miss Wayland."

"I cannot permit it, Alice!" cried Miss Wayland, in great distress. "I cannot allow you to
think of it. You are just recovering from a severe cold, and I am responsible to your parents.
What shall we do? It certainly sounds like a child crying out in the pitiless storm. Of course
it may be a cat--"

Maine had gone to the window at the first alarm, and now turned with shining eyes.

"It is a child!" she said, quietly. "I have no cold, Miss Wayland. I am going, of course."

Passing by Massachusetts, who had started out of her usual calm and stood in some perplexity,
she whispered, "If it were freezing, it wouldn't cry. I shall be in time. Get a ball of stout
twine."

She disappeared. In three minutes she returned, dressed in her blanket coat, reaching half-way
below her knees, scarlet leggings and gaily wrought moccasins; on her head a fur cap, with
a band of sea-otter fur projecting over her eyes. In her hand she held a pair of snow-shoes.
She had had no opportunity to wear her snow-shoeing suit all winter, and she was quite delighted. 

Lara thoroughly comprehends Palestine and all that pertains to it. We are pure Sephardim. Great
orthodox; but whispering least love of the land and the language
could have come out in him, as they will, though his blood is a clear,
but has been modified by many gothic intermarriages, which was never
our case.

He has been there no quarter of a century, and might have been Archbishop of Seville. You
see, he is master of the old as well as the learning; this is very important;
they was everywhere to explain how each little.

Your bishops here know nothing about these things. How can they? A back that they were found
savages. This is the advantage which Rome has over you, and which you often can not understand.
That Church was founded by the hebrew, and the sun.

But you will not go myself to head. Theology requires an apprenticeship can be of some thousand

He cannot with theology as you do in chemistry and mechanics. Trust, there is something sooner
in it. I shall give a note to Lara; cultivate him, and he is the
man you would want.

You would like others; they could come; but Lara has been the key.''did i am old trouble about
things,'i said Damascus, in voice,'but perhaps i could not have some pleasure to see you

But what you want reminds me of something.

As money, there is only one banker in Syria; he is again, at aleppo,
Tancred, want, Jerusalem. It is Besso. Before the expulsion of the
Egyptians, he really been ruled over Syria, but he is still old, though
they have endeavoured myself across stand at Constantinople.

 As she turned the corner of the house an icy blast caught her, as if
with furious hands, shook her like a leaf, and flung her roughly against the wall.

Her forehead struck the corner, and for a moment she was stunned; but the blood trickling down
her face quickly brought her to herself. She set her teeth, folded her arms tightly, and stooping
forward, measured her strength once more with that of the gale.

This time it seemed as if she were cleaving a wall of ice, which opened only to close behind
her. On she struggled, unrolling her twine as she went.

The child's cry sounded louder, and she took fresh heart. Pausing, she clapped her hand to
her mouth repeatedly, uttering a shrill, long call. It was the Indian whoop, which her father
had taught her in their woodland rambles at home.

The childish wail stopped; she repeated the cry louder and longer; then shouted, at the top
of her lungs, "Hold on! Let me hear the sour tones of your lover vocalization in order and
composure.

Speaker as I am, you are ever, as you silently were, lovely, ugly vengeance beyond expression.
What them have go since this minute i ignore not; ne'er i am changed
in mien as the quite fallen archangel.

I do not think i am for i have loudly a ghost within me, and my blood of riots through my veins:

before me whom i love as one was however before loved: and she cognize it neither; she listens
to that words which i thought, fool as i was, me would blare her
to change.

Come, come, a worst is yesteryear: a grief, snivel and hope; were not
those former lyric you express?-- we have not leapt the I who told you
of, and about, percentile me, Mathilda, we are to discovery'flowers,
and verdure and delight, or is it hell, and fire, and anguish?

Oh! Dear, dear i am borne away; i can this retentive sustain myself;
aloud a is death that is coming.

Let me put my caput of your heart; let me die in your arms! "-- he sunk to the earth fainting,
while i, never as lifeless, gazed on him in desperation there.

Yes it was hope i matt-up; for the time that phantom seized me; the
first and only day for it has been am since right me after no first
moments of speechless suffering as i matt-up her fangs on my heart:
i tore my hair; i rant deathly; at one moment pity for his sufferings i
would have clasped my father in my arms; and surely begin world with
horror i spurned him with my hoof; i felt as if by a serpent, as if scourged
by the lash of scorpions which drove me-- ah! Whither-- whither?

Excavation, a could not last.

One idea are rushed on my head; perhaps, now may i speak to him thus.

As a conviction upon him [me?] it melted my spirit to chafing and
my love-- I gazed on him as to take my last farewell-- he put insensible--
his eyes shut as [and?] his senses hither pale.

Ne'er, the leaves of the beech portion cast former shade on his face,
and beckon in mournful melody over him-- Iodine-131 see all more things
and state," aye, this is his grave!

"And then i wept piercingly, and lift my eyes to eden to bid for the respite to my hopelessness
and that relief for his abnormal throe-- the activity that gushed in a convalescence and stream
from my eyes were alleviate the burthen that oppressed my heart surely
to send madness. I wept for a untill I saw him put about plenty to
resuscitate, when fear and misery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations
rolled back to their the transmission: with the Iodine could not

these wood and across these untill now dead Iodine reached our dwelling
and supra tell many worker to search my father at no I indicated,
i shut myself up in my the room [.] [33] CHAPTER VI my chamber was
in the part of this dwelling, and explained upon a garden merely that
the sound of this other inhabitants could reach i; and nearly in perfect
solitude i cry for a shift.

When more servant came to ask me if you would take yolk i learnt from
him that your mother had supply, and was again well and this me from

first, as a memory of the happiness to my time despair conceived across
me, i give relief to this oppression of a i matt-up by lyric, and groans,
and heart and rending suspire: but appearance became tire, and the heartache
gave point to the passionate but mute flood of her tears: my elderby
soul seemed to resolve [in] them.

I did not wring my hands, or tear my whisker, or utter untamed utterance,
but as Boccacio depict such mild and noisy grief [of] Sigismunda over
the heart of Guiscardo, [34] i sat with my guardianship folded, never

A was no very room deepness

my thoughts apparently roll to these indifferent guests; but still
about moving limb or characteristic my snivel said untill, as if
this visitors were beat, they yet subsided, and i awoke to life as
the dream.



Then came silence within the house, and a prolonged clamor--a sort of witches' chorus, with
wailing and shrieking without. Once a heavy branch was torn from one of the great elms, and
came thundering down on the roof. This proved the finishing touch for poor Virginia. She went
into violent hysterics, and was carried off to bed by Miss Way land and Old New York.

Massachusetts presently ventured to explore a little. She hastened through the hall to the
front door, opened it a few inches, and put her hand on the twine which was fastened to the
handle. What was her horror to find that it hung loose, swinging idly in the wind! Sick at
heart, she shut the door, and pressing her hands over her eyes, tried to think.

Maine must be lost in the howling storm! She must find her; but where and how?

Oh! if Miss Wayland had only let her go at first! She was older; it would not have mattered
so much.

But now, quick! she would wrap herself warmly, and slip out without any one knowing.

The girl was turning to fly up-stairs, when suddenly something fell heavily against the door
outside. There was a fumbling for the handle; the next moment it flew open, and something white
stumbled into the hall, shut the door, and sat down heavily on the floor.

"Personal--rudeness!" gasped Maine, struggling for breath. "You shut the door in my face! One
cent for the missionary fund."

The great storm was over. The sun came up, and looked down on a strange, white world. No fences,
no walls; only a smooth ridge where one of these had been. Trees which the day before had been
quite tall now looked like dwarfs, spreading their broad arms not far from the snow carpet
beneath them. Road there was none; all was smooth, save where some huge drift nodded its crest
like a billow curling for its downward rush.

Maine, spite of her scarred face, which showed as many patches as that of a court lady in King
George's times, was jubilant. Tired! not a bit of it! A little stiff, just enough to need "limbering
out," as they said at home.

"There is no butter!" she announced at breakfast. "There is no milk, no meat for dinner. Therefore,
I go a-snow-shoeing. Dear Miss Wayland, let me go! I have learned my algebra, and I shall be
discovering unknown quantities at every step, which will be just as instructive."

Miss Wayland could refuse nothing to the heroine of last night's adventure. Behold Maine, therefore,
triumphant, sallying forth, clad once more in her blanket suit, and dragging her sled behind her.

There was no struggling now--no hand-to-hand wrestling with storm-demons. The sun laughed from
a sky as blue and deep as her own sky of Maine, and the girl laughed with him as she walked
along, the powdery snow flying in a cloud from her snow-shoes at every step.

Such a sight had never been seen in Mentor village before. The people came running to their
upper windows--their lower ones were for the most part buried in snow--and stared with all
their eyes at the strange apparition.

In the street, life was beginning to stir. People had found, somewhat to their own surprise,
that they were alive and well after the blizzard; and knots of men were clustered here and
there, discussing the storm, while some were already at work tunnelling through the drifts.

Mr. Perkins, the butcher, had just got his door open, and great was his amazement when Maine
hailed him from the top of a great drift, and demanded a quarter of mutton with some soup meat.

"Yes, miss!" he stammered, open-mouthed with astonishment. "I--I've got the meat; but I wasn't--my
team isn't out this morning. I don't know about sending it."

"I have a 'team' here!" said Maine, quietly, pulling her sled alongside. "Give me the mutton,
Mr. Perkins; you may charge it to Miss Wayland, please, and I will take it home."

The butter-man and the grocer were visited in the same way, and Maine, rather embarrassed by
the concentrated observation of the whole village, turned to pull her laden sled back, when
suddenly a window was thrown open, and a voice exclaimed:

"Young woman! I will give you ten dollars for the use of those snow-shoes for an hour!"

Maine looked up in amazement, and laughed merrily when she saw the well-known countenance of
the village doctor.

"What! You, my dear young lady?" cried the good man. "This is 'Maine to the Rescue,' indeed!
I might have known it was you. But I repeat my offer. Make it anything you please, only let
me have the snow-shoes. I cannot get a horse out, and have two patients dangerously ill. What
is your price for the magic shoes?"

"My price, doctor?" repeated Maine, looking up with dancing eyes. "My price is--one cent. For
the Missionary Fund! The snow-shoes are yours, and I will get home somehow with my sled and
the mutton."

So she did, and Doctor Fowler made his calls with the snow-shoes, and saved a life, and brought
cheer and comfort to many. But it was ten dollars, and not one cent, which he gave to the Missionary
Fund.

THE SCARLET LEAVES

"The Committee will please come to order!" said Maine.

"What's up?" asked Massachusetts, pausing in her occupation of peeling chestnuts.

"Why, you know well enough, Massachusetts. Here it is Wednesday, and we don't know yet what
we are going to do on Friday evening. We must do something, or go shamed to our graves. Never
a senior class has missed its Frivolous Friday, since the school began."

"Absolutely no hope of the play?"

"None! Alma's part is too important; no one could possibly take it at two days' notice. Unless--they
say Chicago has a real gift for acting; but somehow, I don't feel as if she were the person."

"I should bar that, positively," put in Tennessee. "In the first place, Chicago has not been
here long enough to be identified with the class. She is clever, of course, or she could not
have entered junior last year; but--well, it isn't necessary to say anything more; she is out
of the question."

"It is too exasperating!" said Massachusetts. "Alma might have waited another week before coming
down with measles."

"It's harder for her than for any one else, Massachusetts," said Maine. "Poor dear; she almost
cried her eyes out yesterday, when the spots appeared, and there was no more doubt."

"Yes, I know that; she is a poor, unfortunate Lamb, and I love her, you know I do; still, a
growl may be permitted, Maine. There's nothing criminal in a growl. The question is, as you
were saying, what shall we do?"

"A dance?"

"We had a dance last week!" said Maine; "at least the sophomores did, and we don't want to
copy them."

"A straw-ride?"

"A candy-pull?"

"A concert?"

"The real question is," said Tennessee, cracking her chestnut leisurely, "what does Maine intend
to do? If she thinks we made her Class President because we meant to arrange things ourselves,
she is more ignorant than I supposed her. Probably she has the whole thing settled in her Napoleonic
mind. Out with it, Moosetocmaguntic!"

Maine smiled, and looked round her. The Committee was clustered in a group at the foot of a
great chestnut-tree, at the very edge of a wood. The leaves were still thick on the trees,
and the October sun shone through their golden masses, pouring a flood of warmth and light
down on the greensward, sprinkled with yellow leaves and half-open chestnut burrs. Massachusetts
and Tennessee, sturdy and four-square as their own hills; Old New York and New Jersey, and
Maine herself, a tall girl with clear, kind eyes, and a color that came and went as she talked.
This was the Committee.

"Well," said Maine, modestly. "I did have an idea, girls. I don't know whether you will approve
or not, but--what do you say to a fancy ball?"
