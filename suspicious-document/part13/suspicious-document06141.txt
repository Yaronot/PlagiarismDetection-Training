 His career was cut short by drowning, in 1778.

But it was his beautiful daughter Eliza, born in 1754, who made the sensation of the time,
when she sang with her sister, afterwards Mrs. Tickell. "A nest of nightingales," the family
was termed. Walpole writes, in 1773: "I was not at the ball last night, and have only been
to the opera, where I was infinitely struck with the Carrara, who is the prettiest creature
upon earth. Musical prominence and personal beauty in this maid of but twenty made her an attractive
flower in bloom to others than the king. The wits and gallants of the gay city sought and courted
her. The family of Tom Sheridan, the Irish actor, and then a teacher of elocution in Bath,
was intimate with the Linley family. Richard, who was born in Dublin in 1751, his elder brother
Charles, and Nathaniel Halhed, a companion and literary partner with Richard, all admired the
daughter Eliza. Halhed went to India,--afterwards becoming a judge there,--and Charles Sheridan
retired from the race, and left the literary youth to win as pure a heart as ever cheered incipient
genius to works of worth. She was lauded in verse by her young Irish suitor, and championed
in deed.

He proves his devotion by his action when appealed to by his divinity.

A certain Captain Matthews, one of a numerous breed in Bath in those days,--that is, a fashionable
scoundrel and a married man,--made himself obnoxious to Miss Linley by improper addresses.
He annoyed and harassed her, threatening to destroy himself unless she gratified him, and later
attempted to sully her reputation by calumnies. This brought about the culmination of her attachment
to Sheridan. She fled her father's house and sought the protection of her lover. Eventually the day,

In 1775, the husband's genius was acknowledged by the town; for in January, that year, was
first presented "The Rivals." In that play he draws from the material displayed by the superficial,
flashing, and piquant society of the day at Bath, and from his own experience the inimitable
duel scene therein.

Much success followed for the dramatist. In the following year, in conjunction with his father-in-law,
he purchased from Garrick the Drury Lane Theatre. They brought out several operas together;
Linley's music in "The Duenna" and "The Beggar's Opera," being especially fine. Hazlitt speaks
of the songs in them as having a joyous spirit of intoxication, and strains of the most melting
tenderness.

He admired the daughter, and wrought for us the delightful records of her beauty. His change
of residence, from Bath to London, coincided in date with that of the Sheridans. Opie, too,
painted her portrait; not an ideal one, but good in respect to her eyes. And Romney has given
us good pictures both of her and Mrs. Tickell. Reynolds's portrayal is supreme in indicating
the exaltation of spirit, by the poise of head and perfection of profile. This picture of her
as the patron saint of song was exhibited at the Academy, in 1775, just about the time its
subject had abandoned public singing. It has been most beautifully engraved by Bartolozzi,

She has written much of herself into her records; and calumny urged, at the time of publication,
that she insinuated in her writings a far greater degree of friendship on the poet's part than
really existed.

The Countess Guiccioli was among those who depreciated the Blessingtons' accounts of the conversations;
but then, perchance, there may have been some jealousy of the attractive English woman's influence
over the poet. The Blessingtons left Genoa in June of 1823, and continued their journeyings
throughout Italy until 1828. In the preceding year, Count D'Orsay had become the husband of
the Earl of Blessington's daughter, Lady Harriet Frances Gardiner, when she was but little
over fifteen years of age; but they lived together but three years. In 1829, the Earl died
in Paris; and the Countess continued there until after the Revolution of 1830, when she returned
to England. Her journal of the trip from Naples to Paris, and her stay in that city, was published
in 1841, under the title of "The Idler in France." In England she took a house in Seamore Place,
Mayfair, and later removed to Gore House, Kensington, with which place is associated the traditions
of her elegant entertainings and her intercourse with many men of eminence, but also with a
course of living which compromised her reputation in society. Her son-in-law, the Count, continued
to form one of her household, though separated from his wife, the Lady Harriet. Though not
received in general society, the Countess surrounded herself with celebrities of all nations;
and it was at her house that Louis Napoleon was a cherished guest in his years of exile, and
from whence he proceeded to head the government of France. Here Bulwer came as perhaps her
most intimate friend; here Thackeray was made most welcome, and Lord John Russell and Lord
Palmerston, Canning and Castlereagh were frequent guests. The picture is lovely Quality, and
