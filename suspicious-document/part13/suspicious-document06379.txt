There is nothing very unusual in it. The trees and the flowers, the birds and the small wild
animals which it mentions and describes are such as may be seen in the Iowa fields and woods
by anyone who cares enough about them to walk amid their haunts. The illustrations are such
as the ordinary nature lover may "take" for himself with his pocket kodak. The woodthrush built
in a thicket by the bungalow and borrowed a paper napkin for her nest. The chipmunk came every
morning for his slice of bread. And then the woodchuck learned to be unafraid.

It has long been the author's belief that Iowa has just as much to offer the nature lover as
any other part of the world--that she has indeed a richer flora than many states--and that
every true Iowan ought to know something of her trees and shrubs and herbs, her birds and animals,
and to feel something of the beauty of her skies and her landscapes. There is so much beauty
all around us, every day of the year, shall we not sometimes lift our eyes to behold it?

The majority of Iowa people still find pleasure in the simple life, still have the love for
that which Nature so freely bestows. They find time to look upon the beauty of the world. Many
a busy man finds his best recreation in the woods and fields. It may be only a few hours each
week, but it is enough to keep the music of the flowing waters ever in his ears and the light
of the sunshine in his eyes. It is enough to give the men and the women of the state wholesome
views of life, happy hearts and broad sympathies. Some few find in the woods and fields thoughts
and feelings which are, to them, almost akin to religion. If this little book helps such lovers
of the out-of-doors ever so little; if it shall help others to see for themselves the beauty
and the joy and the goodness of this world in which we live, the author will feel that it has
been worth while.

VII.--AN OLD ROAD IN JULY

In the old woods road a soft haze hung, too subtle to see save where its delicate colorings
were contrasted against the dark green leaves of the oaks beyond the fence. Not the tangible,
vapory haze of early morning, but a tinted, ethereal haze, the visible effluence of the summer,
the nimbus of its power and glory. From tall cord grasses arching over the side of the road,
drawing water from the ditch in which their feet were bathed and breathing it into the air
with the scent of their own greenness; from the transpiration of the trees, shrubs and vines,
flowers and mosses and ferns, from billions of pores in acres of leaves it came streaming into
the sunlight, vanishing quickly, yet ever renewed, as surely as the little brook where the
grasses drank and the grackles fished for tadpoles and young frogs, was replenished by the
hidden spring. Mingled with it and floating in it was another stream of life, the innumerable
living organisms that make up the dust of the sunshine. Pink and white, black and yellow spores
from the mushrooms over the fence in the pasture; pollen pushed from the glumes of the red
top grasses and the lilac spires of the hedge nettle and germander by the roadside; shoals
of spores from the mosses and ferns by the trees and in the swamp; all these life particles
rose and floated in the haze, giving it tints and meanings strangely sweet. When a farmer's
buggy passed along the old road the haze became a warm pink, like some western sky in the evening,
slowly clearing again to turquoise as the dust settled. Viewed in this way, the haze became
a mighty, broad-mouthed river of life, fed by billions of tiny streams and moving ever toward
the vast ocean of the sunlight. Faintly visible to the discerning eye, it was also audible
to the attentive ear, listening as one listens at the edge of a field in the night time to
hear the growing of the corn. If all the millions of leaves had ceased their transpiration,
if this flow of life had been shut off, as the organist pushes in the tremolo stop, the sound
of the summer would not have been the same. Something of the strength and joy of the summer
was in it. Drinking deeply of it the body was invigorated and the heart grew glad. In it the
faith of the winter's buds and the hope of the spring's tender leaves found rich fulfillment.
Theirs was a life of hope and promise that the resurrection should come; this was the glorious
life after the resurrection, faith lost in sight and patient hope crowned.

       *       *       *       *       *

Slender white minarets of the Culver's root, rising from green towers above the leafy architecture
of the woodland undergrowth and reaching toward the light of the sky, told the time of the
year as plainly as if a muezzin had appeared on one of its leafy balconies and proclaimed a
namaz for the middle of July. Beholding them from afar, honey bees came on humming wings for
the nectar lying deep in their tiny florets. Eager stamens reached out far beyond the blossoms
to brush the bees' backs with precious freights of pollen to be transported to the stigmas
of older flowers. Playing each its part in the plan of the universe, flower and insect added
its mite to the life and the loveliness of the summer. From the sunshine and the soil-water
the long leaves manufactured food for the growth of the plant. Prettily notched, daintily tapering,
and arranged in star-like whorls about the stem, they enhanced the beauty of the flowers above
them and attracted the observer to the exquisite order governing their growth. When the leaves
were arranged in whorls of four, the floral spires were quadruple, like the pinnacles on a
church tower; if the green towers were hexagonal, then six white minarets pointed to the sky.
The perfect order of the solar system and the majesty of the Mind which planned it, was manifested
in this single plant. So does beauty lead the way to the mountain tops of truth. By the road
of earthly beauty we may always reach religion and truth is ever beckoning us to new and nobler
visions. That "thread of the all-sustaining beauty, which runs through all and doth all unite"
gently leads us from the things which are tangible and temporal to the truths which are spiritual
and eternal; from the beauty of the concrete to the beauty of the abstract, onward along the
road of beauty and farther up the heights of truth until our admiration for the beauty of the
sunrise, the snow crystal, the graceful spray of the trees in winter, the exquisite order and
harmony of the universe from the orbit of the largest planet to the flow of life in the tiniest
leaf, develops into a lasting love for beauty in life and in character; and still farther up
the heights into an atmosphere of intelligent, rational, genuine love for the Great First Cause
of all beauty. As the heart opens to receive the beauty of the world, as the mind and soul
strive, like the plants, for the highest development, so is the world redeemed from error and
crime and the perfection of the race is attained. If one soul finds this truth more quickly
and easily here amid the trees and flowers, for him is the old road greater than religious
dogmas or social systems.

       *       *       *       *       *

Always beautiful and interesting, in these long days of mid-July the old road is at its best.
No length of day can measure its loveliness or encompass its charm. Very early in the morning
there is a faint rustle of the leaves, a delicate flutter through the woods as if the awakening
birds are shaking out their wings. Shrubs and bushes and trunks of trees have ghostly shapes
in the few strange moments that are neither the darkness nor the dawn. As the light steals
through the woods their forms grow less grotesque. In the half light a phoebe begins her shrill
song. A blue-jay screams. The quail sounds his first "Bob White." Brown thrashers in the thicket--it
is past their time of singing--respond with a strange, sibilant sound, a mingled hiss and whistle,
far different from his ringing songs of May, now only memories; different also from her scoldings
when she was disturbed on her nest and from her tender crooning calls to her babies during June.

As the light increases waves of delicate color appear in the sky to the northeast, and by and
by the sun's face appears over the tops of the trees. He shoots arrows of pale flame through
the woods. In the clearing the trunks of the trees are like cathedral pillars, and the sunlight
comes down in slanting rays as if the openings among the tree-tops were windows and the blue
haze beneath the incense of the morning mass. Black-capped precentor of the avian choir, the
chickadee sounds two sweet tones, clear and musical, like keynotes blown from a silver pipe.
The wood thrush sounds a few organ tones, resonant and thrilling. It is almost his last summer
service; soon, like the thrashers, he will be drooping and silent. The chewink, the indigo
bird, the glad goldfinches, the plaintive pewees are the sopranos; the blue-bird, the quail,
with her long, sweet call, and the grosbeak, with his mellow tones, are the altos; the nuthatch
and the tanager take up the tenor, while the red-headed woodpeckers, the crows and the cuckoos
bear down heavy on the bass. Growing with the light, the fugue swells into crescendo. Lakes
of sunshine and capes of shadow down the old road are more sharply defined. Bushes of tall,
white melilot, clustered with myriads of tiny flowers, exhale a sweet fragrance into the morning
air. The clearing around the house is flooded with sunlight. In the wooded pasture some trunks
are bathed with a golden glory, while others yet stand iron gray in the deep shadows. The world
is awake. The day's work begins. One late young redhead in a hole high up in the decaying trunk
of an aspen tree calls loudly for his breakfast, redoubling his noise as his mother approaches
with the first course. Sitting clumsily on a big stump, a big baby cowbird, well able to shift
for himself, shamelessly takes food from his little field sparrow foster-mother, scarcely more
than half his size. Soon he will leave her and join the flocks of his kindred in the oat-fields
and the swamps. Young chewinks are being fed down among the ripening May-apples in the pasture.
A catbird with soft "quoots" assembles her family in the hazel and the wood-thrush sounds warning
"quirts" as fancied peril approaches her children beneath the ripening blackberries. From the
top of a tall white oak a red squirrel leaps to the arching branches of an elm, continuing
his foraging there. Sitting straight up on a mossy log the chipmunk holds in his paws a bit
of bread thrown from somebody's basket, nibbles at it for a while and then makes a dash for
the thicket, carrying the bread in his mouth.

Tiny rabbits venture out from the tall grasses and look on life with timid eyes. Bees and butterflies
are busy with the day's work. Life with its beauty and its joy is everywhere abundant. Living
things swim in and upon the brook, insects run and leap among the grasses, winged creatures
are in the shrubs, the trees, the air, active, eager, beautiful life is everywhere. The heart
thrills with the beauty, the joy, the zest, the abundance of it, expands to a capacity for
the amplitude of it. Human life grows sweeter, richer, more worth while. There is so much to
live for, so much to hope for; this is the meaning and the glory of the summer.

       *       *       *       *       *

Farther out, where the old road leaves the woods, the landscape is like a vast park, more beautiful
than many a park which the world calls famous. From the crest of the ridge the fields roll
away in graceful curves, dotted with comfortable homes and groves and skirted by heavy timber
down in the valley where the sweet water of the river moves quietly over the white sand. Still
responding to the freshening impulse of the June rains, fields and woods are all a-quiver with
growth. By master magic soil-water and sunshine are being changed into color and form to delight
the eye and food to do the world's work. Every tree is a picture, each leaf is as fresh and
clean as the rain-washed air of the morning. From the low meadows the perfume of the hay is
brought up by the languid breeze. Amber oat-fields are ripening in the sun and in the corn-fields
there is a sense of the gathering force of life as the sturdy plants lift themselves higher
and higher during

    "The long blue solemn hours, serenely flowing
    Whence earth, we feel, gets steady help and good."

Many a tourist comes home to a land like this, weary and penniless, like Sir Launfal after
his fruitless quest, to discover that the grail of health and rest and beauty which he sought
afar so strenuously is most easily and readily found at home.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ceaselessly up and down the old road passes the pageant of the year, never two days the same,
especially at this season. In the middle of the road is a dirt wagon-track, on either side
of which is a broad belt of grass, flowers, shrubs and small trees till you come to the fence.
Beyond one fence the thick woods has a heavy undergrowth; over the other is a well-wooded pasture.
On the south side, between the road and the fence there is a little brook, sometimes with a
high, mossy and timbered bank, sometimes completely hidden by tall grasses. The road rises
and falls in gentle grades, with alternating banks and swales. At one high point there is a
view down the long avenue of trees across the open valley beyond, where the city lies snugly,
and then upward to the timber on the far heights across the river where the hills are always
softly blue, no matter what the season of the year. Sometimes the old road sweeps around fine
old trees in unmathematical curves which add much to its wild beauty. The first man who drove
along it, a hundred years or more ago, followed a cow-path and the road hasn't changed much
since, though the fences which were later threaded through the shrubs and trees on either side,
run straighter. Never was summer day long enough for me to see and to study all that the old
road had to show. Here, at the moist edge of the road, the ditch stone-crop is opening its
yellow-green flowers, each one a study in perfect symmetry. With the showy, straw-colored cyperus
it flourishes under the friendly shade of the overhanging cord-grasses whose flowering stalks
already have shot up beyond the reach of a man. Among them grows the tall blue vervain, its
tapering fingers adorned with circles of blue flowers, like sapphire rings passing from the
base to the tips of the fingers. You must part these grasses and pass through them to see the
thicket of golden-rod making ready for the yellow festival later on. With the trying interrogation

 The wild raspberries on which
the catbirds were feeding today would have been just as fine had there been no catbird to eat
them or human eye to admire them. Had there been no human ear to delight, the song of the woodthrush
would have been just as sweet. The choke-cherries crimsoning in the summer sun, the clusters
of the nuts swelling among the leaves of the hickory will strive to attain perfection, whether
or no there are human hands to gather them. They live in beauty, simplicity and serenity, all-sufficient
in themselves to achieve their ends.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let me live by the old road among the flowers and the trees, the same old road year after year,
yet new with the light of each morning. Shirking not my share of the world's work, let me gather
comfort from the cool grasses and the restful shade of the old road, hope and courage from
the ever-recurring miracle of the morning and the springtime, inspiration to strive nobly toward
a high ideal of perfection. They are talking of improving the old road. They will build pavements
on either side, and a trim park in the middle, where strange shrubs from other states will
fight for life with the tall, rank weeds which always tag the heels of civilization. Then let
me live farther out,--always just beyond the last lamp on the outbound road, like Omar Khayyam
in his strip of herbage, where there are no improvements, no conventionalities, where life
is as large as the world and where the sweet sanities and intimacies of nature are as fresh
and abundant as the dew of the morning. Rather than the pavements, let me see the holes of
the tiger-beetles in the dirt of the road, the funnels of the spiders leading down to the roots
of the grass and their cobwebs spread like ladies' veils, each holding dozens of round raindrops
from the morning shower, as a veil might hold a handful of gleaming jewels. Let me still take
note of the coming of the months by the new flower faces which greet me, each taking their
proper place in the pageant of the year. Old memories of friends and faces, old joys and hopes
and loves flash and fade among the shrubs and the flowers--here we found the orchis, there
we gathered the gentians, under this oak the friend now sleeping spoke simply of his faith
and hope in a future, sweeter summer, when budding thoughts and aspirations should blossom
into fadeless beauty and highest ideals be attained. Let me watch the same birds building the
same shapely homes in the old familiar bushes and listen to the old sweet songs, changeless
through the years. If the big thistle is rooted out, where shall the lark sparrow build her
nest? If the dirt road is paved, how shall the yellow-hammers have their sand-baths in the
evening, while the half grown rabbits frisk around them? Sweet the hours spent in living along
the old road--let my life be simpler, that I may spend more time in living and less in getting
a living. There are so many things deemed essential that really are not necessary at all. One
hour of new thought is better than them all. Let the days be long enough for the zest and joy
of work, for the companionship of loved ones and friends, for a little time loafing along the
old road when the day's work is done. Let me hear the sibilant sounds of the thrashers as they
settle to sleep in the thicket. Give me the fragrance of the milkweed at evening. Let me see
the sunset glow on the trunks of the trees, the ruby tints lingering on the boulder brought
down by the glaciers long ago; the little bats that weave their way beneath the darkening arches
of the leafy roof, while the fire-flies are lighting their lamps in the nave of the sylvan
sanctuary. When the afterglow has faded and the blur of night has come, give me the old, childlike
faith and assurance that tomorrow's sun shall rise again, and that by-and-by, in the same sweet
way, there shall break the first bright beams of Earth's Eternal Easter morning.

VIII.--BY THE RIVERSIDE IN AUGUST

When morning broke, little wisps of mist, like curls of white smoke, were drifting on the surface
of the river as it journeyed through the canyon of cliffs and trees, dark as the walls of night,
toward the valley where the widening sea of day was slowly changing from gray to rosy gold.
Caught in a cove where the water was still these little wisps gathered together and crept in
folds up the face of the cliff, as if they fain would climb to the very top where the red cedars
ran like a row of battlements, twisting their stunted trunks over the brink and hanging their
dark foliage in a fringe eighty feet above the water. But the cliff had for centuries defied
all climbers, though it gave footing here and there to a few friendly plants. At its base the
starry-rayed leaf-cup shed a heavy scent in the stillness of the moist morning. Higher, at
the entrance to a little cave, the aromatic spikenard, with purple stems and big leaves, stood
like a sentinel. From crannies in the limestone wall the harebell hung, its last flowers faded,
but its foliage still delicately beautiful, like the tresses of some wraith of the river, clinging
to the grim old cliff, and waiting, like Andromeda, for a Perseus. Tiny blue-green leaves of
the cliff-brake, strung on slender, shining stems, contrasted their delicate grace with the
ruggedness of the old cliff. Still higher, where a little more moisture trickled down from
the wooded ridge above, the walking fern climbed step by step, patiently pausing to take new
footings by sending out roots from the end of each long, pointed leaf. Near the top of the
cliff, where the red cedars gave some shade, little communities of bulb-bearing ferns and of
polypody displayed their exquisite fronds, as welcome in a world of beauty as smiles on a mother's
face. Mosses and lichens grew here and there, staining the face of the old cliff gray, green
and yellow. These tiny ferns and mosses, each drawing the sort of sustenance it needed from
the layers of the limestone, seemed greater than the mountain of rock. Imposing and spectacular,
yet the rock was dead,--the mausoleum for countless forms of the old life that ceased to be
in ages long forgotten. These fairy forms that sprang from it were the beginnings of the new
life, the better era, the cycle of the future, living, breathing, almost sentient things, transforming
the stubborn stone into beauty of color and form, into faith that moves mountains and hope
that makes this hour the center of all eternity. For them the river had been patiently working
through the centuries, scoring its channel just a little deeper, cutting down ever so little
each year the face of the cliff. Eternity stretched backward to the time when the little stream
running between the thin edges of the melting ice sheets at the top of the high plateau first
began to cut the channel and scarp this mighty cliff; still backward through untold ages to
the time when the lowest layer of limestone in the cliff was only soft sediment on the shore
of a summer sea. Eternity stretched forward, also, to the time when this perpendicular wall
shall have been worn to a gentle slope, clad with luxuriant verdure, and adorned, perchance,
with fairer flowers than any which earth now knows; still forward through other untold ages
to the time when all earth's fires shall have cooled; when wind, rain, storm and flood, shall
have carried even the slope to the sea and made this planet a plain like Mars. Now is the golden
age; this hour is the center of eternity.

       *       *       *       *       *

Red tints of the sunrise brightened into yellow, then followed the white light of an August
day. Now the morning mist has gone; woods, fields and river lie silent in the hot, bright,
apathetic morning. Peace reigns over the smiling fields where Plenty pours from her golden
horn. Here, on the ridge at the top of the cliff, the woods stretch back half a mile to meet
the prairie. Straight down from the red cedars on the brink of the rock the river softly eddies
round a huge boulder,--the remnant of some cliff tragedy countless years ago. In the rent of
the rock from which it fell a turkey-buzzard often sits and spreads her huge wings as the boats
glide by. Storms have scalloped pockets in the softer strata; in them still hang the phoebe's
nests, which were filled with young birds in June. Here and there a swallow's hole may be seen
in the rock; earlier in the season the young birds often peeped out from these holes as if
wishing for strength to come speedily to their wings. Across the river there is a wide beach
where the low water makes ripple-marks in the sand. Narrow leaves of sand-bar willows fringe
the shore, and back of these are the shining leaves of the oaks. Down the river there are glimpses
of the fields,--yellow stubble where the grain has been cut, serried ranks of the green and
tan where the far-flung guidons of the tasselled corn stretch away up the slope like a mighty
army to demolish the cloud-castles of refuge on the far horizon where the mists fled for safety
from the pursuing rays of the sun. Overhead the oak-leaves are motionless, like the comforting,
brooding wings of Peace. It is a time for rest and quiet joy in the beauty and the fulness
of the year. Now, in the grateful shade of some friendly old oak, is the time to "loaf and
invite my soul."

       *       *       *       *       *

Happy is the man who has made a companion of some fine old tree standing near his home, type
of the tree which he loved in his boyhood, perchance the very same huge white oak. He learns
to go to it as he would to his friend, to let the old tree share his sorrows and his joys.
Others may be heedless of its charm, ignorant of its power to help, but for him it always has
a welcome and a ministry of beauty. He learns to visit it often, to talk to it in his thoughts.
Some dreamy summer morning he muses on its history, its service to mankind. The old tree seems
to bend its branches down to listen as he says:

"I know you, old tree, and I love you. You belong to one of the first and finest families.
The remains of your ancestors have been found in the eocene and miocene rocks, away, way north
of your home at the present time. They grew in beauty long before man's face was seen upon
the earth. The whole of civilization has rested beneath your ancestral shade. Long before the
Eternal City was founded your ancestors adorned the seven hills and beautified the grass beneath
with the flickering shadows cast by their sunlit leaves. Some of them which gave shade to the
first habitations in the proud city that from her throne of beauty ruled the world were still
fine and flourishing centuries later when Pliny sat beneath them in studious contemplation.
Others of your ancestors, old tree, formed the sacred grove of Dodona, where the oracles spake
to minds as yet in darkness. They were accounted fit to compare in might and majesty with Jove
himself, and some of them stood like sturdy sentinels around his Roman temple. The civic crown
which adorned the brows of Roman heroes as a reward for great deeds done, was made of green
leaves from their branches. In the shadow of your ancestors Pan played his pipes, Theocritus
sat and listened to the everlasting laughter of the summer sea and his shepherds and goatherds
reclined to engage in their friendly contests of song. Vergil in his eclogues paid tribute
to their beauty and grandeur. They guarded the Druids' sacred fire and some of them are living
yet which gave shelter to the victorious legions of William the Conqueror when he crossed the
channel more than two thousand years ago. Hearts of oak made the ships which helped a nation
fight her way to the supremacy of the sea and also the caravels which bore an intrepid discoverer
across the weary waste of waters to the threshold of the new home for all those seeking life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Some of your ancestors made the log cabins to shelter
the band of pioneers led by the pious Hooker into the valley of the Connecticut and another
preserved the precious charter until the storm of tyranny had passed. It is your family, old
tree, which has lent itself willingly to the service of man, in the comfort and stability of
his home and in the panels and carvings which adorn the great cathedrals he has built for the
worship of his Creator and the enrichment of his own soul."

Still the old tree listens. The heart warms toward it as memory speaks of its companionship
through the years:

"And I have watched you, old tree, in storm and in sunshine; in the early winter when the soft
snow stuck fast to your rugged old trunk and your branches and twigs and made you a picture
of purity; and in the later winter when the fierce storms wrestled in vain with your sinewy
limbs. The oracles is chipmunk to have been built from Doughnut'he taught.

Them travel them have disturbed again:
 Here and there the little bag-like blossoms
of the gerardia, or foxglove, are opening among the stems of the fading grass, and the white
blossoms of the marsh bellflower, the midget member of the campanula family, are apparently
as fresh and numerous as they were in early July. Water horehound has whitish whorls of tiny
blossoms and prettily cut leaves, which are as interesting as the flowers. And still the river
beckons onward, murmuring that the quest of the flower-lover is not yet done and that the prize
awaits the victor who presses on to the swamp around the bend where the birches hang drooping
branches over quiet, fish-full pools. The prize is worth the extra half-mile. It is the gorgeous
flower of late summer, a fit symbol of August, the queen blossom of a queenly month, the brilliant
red lobelia, or cardinal flower. There is no flower in the year so full of vivid color. Sometimes,
but only very rarely, the purple torches of the exquisite little fringed orchis (habenaria
psychodes) lights up a swampy place beneath the trees and sheds its delicate fragrance as a
welcome to the bees.

       *       *       *       *       *

The life of an August day, like all life, comes too quickly to a close. In the morning of a
day, of a summer, or of a life, there seems so much ahead; so many friends to help and cheer,
so much beauty to behold, so many pleasant roads to roam, so much to accomplish, and so many
treasures to gather by the way. But when the days are growing shorter and the twilight falls,
perhaps it is enough if we can feel that we have at the best but faithful failures; perhaps
enough if we have forgotten the dust and the rocks and the mire, and have treasured only the
memories of the beauty and the music and the joy which was ours by the way; surely enough if
we can look forward happily and peacefully to the west where

    The sky is aglow with colors untold,
    With a triumph of crimson and opal and gold,
    And wavering curtains woven of fire
    Are hung o'er the portals of Day's desire.
    The sun goes to rest in his western halls
    And over the world, the twilight falls.

And then the glory fades to gray and beautiful Venus smiles at us just over the tops of the
trees. Little is heard save the occasional note of the whip-poor-will and the constant reminder
from the katydid that it is not far to frost. But the river ripples softly around the rocks
and a cool air stirs in the trees above, exorcising all mournful spirits. The harvest moon
is rising and the white light lies sleeping, dreaming, on trees and cliff and river. On such
a night pleading Pan wooed his coy nymph with the promise:

    And then I'll tell you tales that no one knows
      Of what the trees talk in the summer nights;
    When far above you hear them murmuring,
      As they sway whispering to the lifting breeze.

IX.--THE PASSING OF SUMMER

When the wild plums ripen in the thicket by the creek and the grapes are purpling in the kisses
of the sun; when even the sunlight itself grows mellow and the landscape wears a dreamy haze,
colored like the bloom on a plum, as if the year, too, had reached perfect ripeness; then it
is mid-September and Iowa begins a season of loveliness which shall hardly be excelled anywhere
on earth.

Young birds imitate the spring songs of their parents in a faint, wistful, reminiscent way,
some of those hatched early in the year rising almost to full song, as in the case of the meadow
larks whose music rings through the meadows and makes the balmy afternoons seem like those
of early May. The wild strawberry blossoms again; the violet and some of the other spring flowers.
But the signs of the passing of the summer are everywhere in evidence. Dense, white morning
mists--the September mists--lie in the valleys and yield but slowly to the shafts of the rising
sun. Flocks of feathered voyagers are shaping their course toward the south. Gold and crimson
leaves grow more numerous along the lanes and in the woods. Antares, Altair and Vega, with
the summer constellations, are passing farther towards the west, while before bedtime Fomalhaut
may be seen at the mouth of the Southern Fish in the southeast and the creamy white Capella
is leading up Auriga in the northeast. Between them, just over the eastern rim of the world,
appear the Pleiades, their "sweet influences" in keeping with the season. The summer is passing,
but not in sadness. Some of the greatest of its glories are reserved for these last days.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now the cicada, forgetting to give his winding salute at sundown, has almost dropped out of
the insect orchestra and the katydid, too, is heard less often. The rest of the screeching
musicians vary the volume and the speed of their music in approximate ratio to the temperature.
In the warm evening they saw and rub away at presto time as if they were determined to get
to the end of the selection before the curtain goes up for the moonlight scene; but they slacken
to moderato when the nights grow cooler, slower, always slower, and fainter as the chill air
creeps through the woods. When the north wind filters coldly through the trees their music
thins and dims till it sounds pathetic as the tick of a tall clock in a lonely house at night.
But it warms up again with the sunshine next day, keeping time and tune with the varying moods
of the final days of the summer. When a dreamy, hazy day is followed by a mellow night and
little patches of white moonlight lie dreaming beneath the trees, the crickets have a lullaby
that comes in rhythmic beats, as if they watched the moonlight breathe and rocked the world
to sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

Comforting and soothing as the touch of a loved hand on a fevered brow come the first cooling
breezes of September after the fierce white heat of August. Sweeter than music is the sound
of the wind, as it passes through the woods, welcomed by millions of waving branches and dancing
leaves. It brings the call of the quail, the scream of the jay, the bark of the squirrel, the
crack of the hunter's gun, the first notes of the returning bluebirds, the clean, keen scent
of the earth after rain, the courage and joy of life, motion, action. Seen from the top of
a cliff the acres of foliage spread out in the creek valley beneath has a motion suggesting
the waves of the sea, now flowing in green billows before the wind, now whipped into spray
at the shore of the creek where the willows show the white sides of their leaves.

In the fields the far-flung banners of the corn take on ripening tints and begin to rustle
drily in the breeze. Golden ears, wrapped in tobacco-brown silk, are pushing from tanned and
purplish husks. Newly-plowed fields were made possible by the rains which started the grass
growing in the stubble, changing the color from amber to emerald and wrought a miracle of verdure
in the pastures which August had baked brown. Here and there the aftermath of red clover has
developed a field of new blossoms,--a little lake of pink where sunshine plays with shadow
and sturdy humble bees spend the days in ecstasy.

       *       *       *       *       *

Summer puts on her last bright robes for the final floral review before she is borne by the
birds down the valley to set up her court in the southland. Tall and soldierly, this last gay
army of the flowers passes in review before her. Blazing stars in pink and purple, tall and
picturesque, with long rows of brilliant buttons; regiments of asters in blue and white and
purple; rattle-snake root with big and quaintly slashed leaves and hundreds of tassels in delicate
shades of lilac, purple and white; swamp sunflowers in dazzling yellow, camped in millions
along the creek bottom to make it more glorious than the historical pageant of the Field of
the Cloth of Gold; plumy battalions of golden-rod, marshalled by the sun along every country
lane; companies of tall, saw-leaved sunflowers with golden petals and darker disks, deployed
along the fences and seen at their best in the twilight when they look like friendly faces
with beaming eyes; as I write them so they march across the land and bow farewell to summer. Game,

 At sundown the sandhill crane may sometimes be
surprised, standing like a silhouette by the shore of a grassy island. The awkward, wary bittern
and the still more vigilant least bittern are familiar residents here.

Below the dam the creek winds at will through a peaceful valley, appropriating to itself an
ever widening stretch from the farm lands. Sometimes it hastens down a pebbly speedway, then
slackens its pace and wanders off from its course until suddenly it seems to grow alarmed,
whips around a bend and comes hurrying back. Sometimes its level flood-plain is a quarter mile
wide, bounded on either side by steep timbered hills which stretch on and on down the valley
until the sky receives them in a glory of blue haze. Sometimes the creek has cut its way straight
down the face of a high rock cliff on one side, while on the other side is a level meadow with
bushy-margined ponds. In places the water of the creek lies asleep in a dream of sunshine,
but further on it ripples and gurgles over a bouldered bed, walled in by rocky slopes. These
are kept moist by water trickling down from hidden springs among the roots of the shrubs and
vines, ferns and mosses which soften the grim limestone into beauty of form and color.

In the cool days of September, when walking is a fine art, I love to accompany the lower portion
of the old creek down to the river, following the little path made by farmer boys and fishermen.
The two posts at the fence by the roadside, set just far enough apart for a man to squeeze
himself through, are the gates to a land elysian. When I pass through them I am a thousand
miles from the city with its toil and pain, its strife and sorrow. Worldly cares drop from
my back as I stand upon the brink of this creek and watch the water spreading itself out over
the white sand. Time and distance lose their force as factors in my life. I have found and
entered the lost lands of Theocritus. Beneath this black ash, touched here and there with the
purple wistfulness of the passing year, Pan might have sat to play his pipes, the Cyclops might
have pleaded with the graceful Galatea. This haze which hangs over the white oak grove, for
aught I know, may be the incense from Druid fires. Along this valley Chaucer's Immortals may
have gone a pilgriming, and in this bosky wood Robin Hood may have trained his band. The legend
that from this cliff an Indian lover on his favorite pony once leaped to the creek a hundred
feet below and a mighty funeral ceremony was held at the Indian mound a little farther down
the valley seems to be attested both by the cliff and the mound. Before I have gone very far
I am unconcernedly conscious that I have not the slightest idea in which direction lies the
nearest road home, nor how far I have come. But I know that somewhere down the lavender-veiled
valley the creek and myself shall reach the river at last and all will be well. When his peeper become

 To many of us one stalk of golden-rod
looks much like another, but a very little study will readily enable us to distinguish between
the different species and will add wonderfully to its interest and charm. There is the tall,
smooth stemmed golden-rod, with saw toothed leaves, except near the base and ample pyramids
of medium-sized clusters of blossoms; this is the solidago serotina, or late golden-rod. A
similar golden-rod, but with hairy stems and smaller flower clusters is the solidago Canadensis
or Canada golden-rod. Both these grow in the bottoms anywhere near the creek. Along the moist
clay banks the elm-leaved golden-rod shows its tall stem with the leaves which give the plant
its distinctive name, surmounted by several threadlike spreading branches strung with little
bits of leaves and clusters of yellow blossoms at the ends, as if the slender, curving, green
branches had been dipped in gold dust. On the same slopes may usually be found the zig-zag
or broad-leaved golden-rod, with leaves as broad as the palm of a lady's hand and little wand-like
clusters of blossoms, several of them from the axil of each leaf. This plant is called the
zig-zag golden-rod because its stem often turns first one way and then the other, as if it
hadn't made up its mind which way to grow. Higher up on the dry rocky banks is the gray or
field golden-rod, whose small leaves are covered with grayish down and whose rather short stem
is topped by a flattish pyramid of brilliant yellow flowers. This is one of the early golden-rods,
but it lasts well into the fall. "yes." And Mother, until i, is not grow. Trim, of class sugar. "But

In these last days of the summer there comes a grateful sense of the ripeness which crowns
the year. Nothing in nature has hid its talent in a napkin. Every tree and shrub and herb has
something to show in return for the privilege of having lived and worked in a world of beauty.
Catbirds on the eve of their departure for the southland are feasting on the red and yellow
wild plums, and the crab apples are beginning to give forth a faint fragrance which will grow
more pronounced from now until October. The amber clusters of the hop are poured in profusion
over the reddening fruit of the hawthorn. Farther on is the brook Eschol where the purple grapes
are hanging. The snowy clusters of the sweet elder, which were so beautiful in July and early
August, have developed into ample clusters of juicy berries which bring memories of the wine
that grandmother used to make. Flocks of robins are feeding greedily on the abundant wild cherries.
Thickets of panicled dogwood are feeding stations for other migrants; already the crimson fruit-stalks
have been stripped of half their white berries. These native fruits are so many and so varied,
they make the walk a constant delight. Each plant is a revelation. Who ever saw for the first
time the huge clusters of fruit hanging from the wild spikenard on the face of the cliff and
did not thrill with the charm of a great discovery? Each cluster of ruby, winey berries is
as large as a hickory-nut and the clusters are aggregated upon stalks so as to resemble huge
bunches of grapes. For contrast there are the little bunches of whitish berries on the low-growing
false spikenard; they are speckled with reddish and gray dots as if they might be cowbird's
eggs in miniature. Jack-in-the-pulpits show club-shaped bunches of scarlet berries here and
there among the grasses. On the wooded slopes there are the white fruits of the baneberry on
its quaintly-shaped red stalks, the pretty fruit clusters of the moonseed and the smilax. The
scattered berries of the green-brier will be black in winter, but their September hue is a
bronze green of a delicate shade which artists might envy. It will take another month to ripen
the drupes of the black-haw into their blue-black beauty; now they are green on one side and
red on the other, like a ripening apple. It's a fine education to know just which fruits you
may nibble and which you must not eat. Red-stalked clusters of black berries hang from the
vines of the Virginia creeper among leaves just touched with the hectic flame that tells of
their passing, all too soon. At the sign of the sumac, tall torches of garnet berries rise. Beauty,
caput are exercised rearward, instrumentality are lost absolutely, on one. And, "Contact, don!"

 Once in a day's journey along the creek one may find a small red maple.
In the middle of its foliage is a small, flame-like spot which grows larger day by day. Gradually
some of the other maples catch the color fire, first a little soft maple by the shore of a
muddy bayou, next a small sugar maple on the rocky slope. The great spectacle does not come
until October, but the placards announcing it grow more numerous and vivid day by day. Blackberry
leaves are splashed with crimson; daily the blood-red banner of the sumac grows larger and
more striking. Walnuts and hickories begin to lose their yellow leaves; patches of yellow appear
on the elms and the lindens; though the mass of the foliage remains until October, many leaves
flutter down daily, and it is possible to see twice as far into the thicket as in June.

Flocks of grackles spend their days in the cornfields which run down to the creek bottom and
their nights amid the wild rice and the rushes and willows in the swamp. In the timber fringes
and the broad bottoms along the creek you get glimpses of the catbird feasting on the grapes
and the wild plums; the brown thrasher and the woodthrush, wholly silent now; the little house
wren who has lost her chatter; the vireos and the orioles, the wood pewee, the crested fly
catcher and the kingbird. They all seem to be going southward. There are a few nests and young
birds in the early part of the month--the yellow-billed cuckoo, the Savannah sparrow, the goldfinch.
But these are exceptions to the general rule.

Little flocks of warblers flit among the tree tops and the bushy margin of ponds near the creek
will soon be alive with the myrtle warblers--as numerous as English sparrows in a barn-yard. Go

Gradually you become conscious that all of them are flying southward, always down the stream
and never up. The first keen blasts up in the northland have given them a warning and they
are going steadily, happily, but for the most part silently, on down the stream, giving rare
beauty to these halcyon days of late summer; on past the farthest point of your vision, where
the silver gray mist softens the outline of the forest-crowned headlands, and lavender shadows
hang gently across the valleys; always on and on towards the land where all is light and life
and where summer ever abides in beauty. "it doesn't number," Your family state her are fecklessly.
