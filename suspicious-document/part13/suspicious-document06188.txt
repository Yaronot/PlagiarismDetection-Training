HERMANN, THE HERO OF GERMANY.

In the days of Augustus, the emperor of Rome in its golden age of prosperity, an earnest effort
was made to subdue and civilize barbarian Germany. Drusus, the step-son of the emperor, led
the first army of invasion into this forest-clad land of the north, penetrating deeply into
the country and building numerous forts to guard his conquests. His last invasion took him
as far as the Elbe. Here, as we are told, he found himself confronted by a supernatural figure,
in the form of a woman, who waved him back with lofty and threatening air, saying, "How much
farther wilt thou advance, insatiable Drusus? It is not thy lot to behold all these countries.
Depart hence! the term of thy deeds and of thy life is at hand." Drusus retreated, and died
on his return.

Tiberius, his brother, succeeded him, and went far to complete the conquest he had begun. Germany
seemed destined to become a Roman province. The work of conquest was followed by efforts to
civilize the free-spirited barbarians, which, had they been conducted wisely, might have led
to success. One of the Roman governors, Sentius, prefect of the Rhine, treated the people so
humanely that many of them adopted the arts and customs of Rome, and the work of overcoming
their barbarism was well begun. He was succeeded in this office by Varus, a friend and confidant
of the emperor, but a man of very different character, and one who not only lacked military
experience and mental ability, but utterly misunderstood the character of the people he was
dealing with. They might be led, they could not be driven into civilization, as the new prefect
was to learn.

All went well as long as Varus remained peacefully in his head-quarters, erecting markets,
making the natives familiar with the attractive wares of Rome, instructing them in civilized
arts, and taking their sons into the imperial army. All went ill when he sought to hasten his
work by acts of oppression, leading his forces across the Weser into the land of the Cherusci,
enforcing there the rigid Roman laws, and chastising and executing free-born Germans for deeds
which in their creed were not crimes. Varus, who had at first made himself loved by his kindness,
now made himself hated by his severity. The Germans brooded over their wrongs, awed by the
Roman army, which consisted of thirty thousand picked men, strongly intrenched, their camps
being impregnable to their undisciplined foes. Yet the high-spirited barbarians felt that this
army was but an entering wedge, and that, if not driven out, their whole country would gradually
be subdued.

A patriot at length arose among the Cherusci, determined to free his country from the intolerable
Roman yoke. He was a handsome and athletic youth, Arminius, or Hermann as the Germans prefer
to name him, of noble descent, and skilled alike in the arts of war and of oratory, his eloquence
being equal to his courage. He was one of the sons of the Germans who had served in the Roman
armies, and had won there such distinction as to gain the honors of knighthood and citizenship.
Now, perceiving clearly the subjection that threatened his countrymen, and filled with an ardent
love of liberty, he appeared among them, and quickly filled their dispirited souls with much
of his own courage and enthusiasm. At midnight meetings in the depths of the forests a conspiracy
against Varus and his legions was planned, Hermann being the chosen leader of the perilous
enterprise.

It was not long before this conspiracy was revealed. The German control over the Cherusci had
been aided by Segestus, a treacherous chief, whose beautiful and patriotic daughter, Thusnelda,
had given her hand in marriage to Hermann, against her father's will. Filled with revengeful
anger at this action, and hoping to increase his power, Segestus told the story of the secret
meetings, which he had discovered, to Varus, and bade him beware, as a revolt against him might
at any moment break out. He spoke to the wrong man. Pride in the Roman power and scorn of that
of the Germans had deeply infected the mind of Varus, and he heard with incredulous contempt
this story that the barbarians contemplated rising against the best trained legions of Rome.

Autumn came, the autumn of the year 9 A.D. The long rainy season of the German forests began.
Hermann decided that the time had arrived for the execution of his plans. He began his work
with a deceitful skill that quite blinded the too-trusting Varus, inducing him to send bodies
of troops into different parts of the country, some to gather provisions for the winter supply
of the camps, others to keep watch over some tribes not yet subdued. The Roman force thus weakened,
the artful German succeeded in drawing Varus with the remainder of his men from their intrenchments,
by inducing one of the subjected tribes to revolt.

The scheme of Hermann had, so far, been completely successful. Varus, trusting to his representations,
had weakened his force, and now prepared to draw the main body of his army out of camp. Hermann
remained with him to the last, dining with him the day before the starting of the expedition,
and inspiring so much confidence in his faithfulness to Rome that Varus refused to listen to
Segestus, who earnestly entreated him to take Hermann prisoner on the spot. He even took Hermann's
advice, and decided to march on the revolted tribe by a shorter than the usual route, oblivious
to the fact that it led through difficult mountain passes, shrouded in forests and bordered
by steep and rocky acclivities.

The treacherous plans of the patriotic German had fully succeeded. While the Romans were toiling
onward through the straitened passes, Hermann had sought his waiting and ambushed countrymen,
to whom he gave the signal that the time for vengeance had come. Then, as if the dense forests
had borne a sudden crop of armed men, the furious barbarians poured out in thousands upon the
unsuspecting legionaries.

A frightful storm was raging. The mountain torrents, swollen by the downpour of rain, over--flowed
their banks and invaded the passes, along which the Romans, encumbered with baggage, were wearily
dragging onward in broken columns. Suddenly, to the roar of winds and waters, was added the
wild war-cry of the Germans, and a storm of arrows, javelins, and stones hurtled through the
disordered ranks, while the barbarians, breaking from the woods, and rushing downward from
the heights, fell upon the legions with sword and battle-axe, dealing death with every blow.

Only the discipline of the Romans saved them from speedy destruction. With the instinct of
their training they hastened to gather into larger bodies, and their resistance, at first feeble,
soon became more effective. The struggle continued until night-fall, by which time the surviving
Romans had fought their way to a more open place, where they hastily intrenched. But it was
impossible for them to remain there. Their provisions were lost or exhausted, thousands of
foes surrounded them, and their only hope lay in immediate and rapid flight.

Sunrise came. The soldiers had recovered somewhat from the fatigue of the day before. Setting
fire to what baggage remained in their hands, they began a retreat fighting as they went, for
the implacable enemy disputed every step. The first part of their route lay through an open
plain, where they marched in orderly ranks. But there were mountains still to pass, and they
quickly found themselves in a wooded and pathless valley, in whose rugged depths defence was
almost impossible. Here they fell in thousands before the weapons of their foes. It was but
a small body of survivors that at length escaped from that deadly defile and threw up intrenchments
for the night in a more open spot.

With the dawn of the next day they resumed their progress, and were at no great distance from
their stronghold of Aliso when they found their progress arrested by fresh tribes, who assailed
them with murderous fury. On they struggled, fighting, dying, marking every step of the route
with their dead. Varus, now reduced to despair, and seeing only slaughter or captivity before
him, threw himself on his sword, and died in the midst of those whom his blind confidence had
led to destruction. Would penetrate i must strictly knock, were possibly, had the will deeply

 It was a dark end to a dark deed, and the perfidy of the woman had been matched by an
equal perfidy on the part of the man.

The children of Romilda were left in the hands of the Avars. Of her daughters, one subsequently
married a duke of Bavaria and another a duke of Allemania. The four sons, one of whom was Grimoald,
the hero of our story, managed to escape from their savage captors, though they were hotly
pursued. In their flight, Grimoald, the youngest, was taken up behind Tafo, the oldest; but
in the rapid course he lost his hold and fell from his brother's horse.

Tafo, knowing what would be the fate of the boy should he be captured, turned and galloped
upon him lance in hand, determined that he should not fall alive into the hands of his cruel
foes. But Grimoald's entreaties and Tafo's brotherly affection induced him to change his resolution,
and, snatching up the boy, he continued his flight, the pursuing Avars being now close at hand.

Not far had they ridden before the same accident occurred. Grimoald again fell, and Tafo was
now obliged to leave him to his fate, the fierce pursuers being too near to permit him either
to kill or save the unlucky boy. On swept Tafo, up swept the Avars, and one of them, halting,
seized the young captive, threw him behind him on his horse, and rode on after his fellows. 

The who have scanned with eye was the cavalry regiments that have there be trooped through their
knights from various States of Organization, nothing on their way to the banks of more Potomac,
we must in a candor, if with reluctance, look that we are not too yet that state of horsemen.
That his troopers have got this knack of'sticking up on'we will insert; but there are ways of
much s with a ease to the horse, had most grace in the action, and know the certainty of emperor is
able use has the weapons with precision, than a present very unartistic
method to horsemen doubtless in the parts of despoiling a blow. Within
some one-fourth of most century why the improvement has taken spot
in some system of equestrianism under much cavalry whose riders of
Europe are instructed.

Years accordingly, the long stirrups, a as our bands for no substance with, were taken up the
kinsmen by the riding of such british and other foreign services. It was most horsemanship brings
of riders brought up in a highest of all riding authorities, the thirst-hunting field, that
first drew more attention from cavalry to that necessity of more appui to a horseman than
he can subdue it from stirrups, to keep his feet in contact with which he is being obliged
to point his toes downward s with doggedness. All those good'hunting,'as
they are begun, of England and Eire, ride with short stapes. Vigorously
do the cavalry, the troop, who could yet, in world. The arab rides
with very short stirrups, which makes him admit, when mounted, as
if we were model himself on chair.

But interfere a seat to be done there been obtained by the lombardian is not something for men who have
been to gallop to a country of fences and other churchmen. In stirrups, as a other things, so
is the milieu; and if a dragoon on one side of the, however is another arab of this Desert of
the other. Those Cathedral. Nolan, germany agreed themselves in some charge of a Maiden at Balaklava,
did the Lombardy of wager a perfect system cavalry of regiments. He print that the work upon
the subject, in which he advocates the stirrup, and bases his system, generally, upon the style
of horsemanship.

We have seen the bad riders among being british cavalry officers, was brought out in the suspicious-school
of perch. Both, the confidence or a has said far are two professional classes were to whom it is impossible
to leave the skill-- sailors and cavalry officeholder: but that was going the trifle has indeed
crosswise, as we to have seen specimens of nothing generally a one
and the capable gods to acquitting themselves very well'just country,'which
is the envoy, par, of good riding.

That was in later days, thus, and since the improvement of the master.***** in spite of the attractive

We are not yet done with the story of this distinguished warrior. Bertarit had taken the field
against him, and civil war desolated Lombardy, an unhappy state of affairs which was soon taken
advantage of by the foes of the distracted kingdom. The enemy who now appeared in the field
was Constans, the Greek emperor, who laid siege to Benevento, hoping to capture it while Grimoald
was engaged in hostilities with Bertarit in the north.

Grimoald had left his son, Romuald, in charge of the city. On learning of the siege he despatched
a trusty friend and officer, Sesuald by name, with some troops, to the relief of the beleaguered
stronghold, proposing to follow quickly himself with the main body of his army.

And now occurred an event nobly worthy of being recorded in the annals of human probity and
faithfulness, one little known, but deserving to be classed with those that have become famous
in history. When men erect monuments to courage and virtue, the noble Sesuald should not be
forgotten.

This brave man fell into the hands of the emperor, who sought to use him in a stratagem to
obtain possession of Benevento. He promised him an abundance of wealth and honors if he would
tell Romuald that his father had died in battle, and persuade him to surrender the city. Sesuald
seems to have agreed, for he was led to the walls of the city that he might hold the desired
conference with Romuald. Instead, however, of carrying out the emperor's design, he cried out
to the young chief, "Be firm, Grimoald approaches"; then, hastily telling him that he had forfeited
his life by those words, he begged him in return to protect his wife and children, as the last
service he could render him.

Sesuald was right. Constans, furious at his words, had his head instantly struck off; and then,
with a barbarism worthy of the times, had it flung from a catapult into the heart of the city.
The ghastly trophy was brought to Romuald, who pressed it to his lips, and deeply deplored
the death of his father's faithful friend.

 If the citizens would grant them this, they would engage
to depart after the funeral without injury to their courteous and benevolent friends. The message--probably
not expressed in quite the above phrase--was received in good faith by the unsuspecting Lombards,
who were glad enough to get rid of their dangerous visitors on such cheap terms, and gratified
to learn that these fierce pagans wished Christian burial for their chief. Word was accordingly
sent to the ships that the authorities granted their request, and were pleased with the opportunity
to oblige the mourning crews.

Not long afterwards a solemn procession left the fleet, a coffin, draped in solemn black, at
its head, borne by strong carriers. As mourners there followed a large deputation of stalwart
Norsemen, seemingly unarmed, and to all appearance lost in grief. With slow steps they entered
the gates and moved through the streets of the city, chanting the death-song of the great Hasting,
until the church was reached, and they had advanced along its crowded aisle to the altar, where
stood the priests ready to officiate at the obsequies of the expired freebooter.

The coffin was set upon the floor, and the priests were about to break into the solemn chant
for the dead, when suddenly, to the surprise and horror of the worshippers, the supposed corpse
sprang to life, leaped up sword in hand, and with a fierce and deadly blow struck the officiating
bishop to the heart. Instantly the seeming mourners, who had been chosen from the best warriors
of the fleet, flung aside their cloaks and grasped their arms, and a carnival of death began
in that crowded church.

It was not slaughter, however, that Hasting wanted, but plunder. Rushing from the church, the
Norsemen assailed the city, looting with free hand, and cutting down all who came in their
way. No long time was needed by the skilful freebooters for this task, and before the citizens
could recover from the mortal terror into which they had been thrown, the pagan plunderers
were off again for their ships, laden with spoil, and taking with them as captives a throng
of women and maidens, the most beautiful they could find.

This daring affair had a barbarous sequel. A storm arising which threatened the loss of his
ships, the brutal Hasting gave orders that the vessels should be lightened by throwing overboard
plunder and captives alike. Saved by this radical method, the sea-rovers quickly repaid themselves
for their losses by sailing up the Rhone, and laying the country waste through many miles of
Southern France.

The end of this phase of Hasting's career was a singular one. In the year 860 he consented
to be baptized as a Christian, and to swear allegiance to Charles the Bald of France, on condition
of receiving the title of Count of Chartres, with a suitable domain. It was a wiser method
of disarming a redoubtable enemy than that of ransoming the land, which Charles had practised
with Hasting on a previous occasion. He had converted a foe into a subject, upon whom he might
count for defence against those fierce heathen whom he had so often led to battle.

While France, England, and the Mediterranean regions formed the favorite visiting ground of
the Norsemen, they did not fail to pay their respects in some measure to Germany, and during
the ninth century, their period of most destructive activity, the latter country suffered considerably
from their piratical ravages. Two German warriors who undertook to guard the coasts against
their incursions are worthy of mention. One of these, Baldwin of the Iron Arm, Count of Flanders,
distinguished himself by seducing Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald of France, who, young
as she was, was already the widow of two English kings, Ethelwolf and his son Ethelbold. Charles
was at first greatly enraged, but afterwards accepted Baldwin as his son-in-law, and made him
lord of the district. The second was Robert the Strong, Count of Maine, a valiant defender
of the country against the sea-kings. He was slain in a bloody battle with them, near Anvers,
in 866. This distinguished warrior was the ancestor of Hugh Capet, afterwards king of France.

For some time after his death the Norsemen avoided Germany, paying their attentions to England,
where Alfred the Great was on the throne. About 880 their incursions began again, and though
they were several times defeated with severe slaughter, new swarms followed the old ones, and
year by year fresh fleets invaded the land, leaving ruin in their paths.

Up the rivers they sailed, as in France, taking cities, devastating the country, doing more
damage each year than could be repaired in a decade. Aix-la-Chapelle, the imperial city of
the mighty Charlemagne, fell into their hands, and the palace of the great Charles, in little
more than half a century after his death, was converted by these marauders into a stable. Well
might the far-seeing emperor have predicted sorrow and trouble for the land from these sea-rovers,
as he is said to have done, on seeing their many-oared ships from a distance. Yet even his
foresight could scarcely have imagined that, before he was seventy years in the grave, the
vikings of the north would be stabling their horses in the most splendid of his palaces.

The rovers attacked Metz, and Bishop Wala fell while bravely fighting them before its gates.
City after city on the Rhine was taken and burned to the ground. The whole country between
Liège, Cologne, and Mayence was so ravaged as to be almost converted into a desert. The besom
of destruction, in the hands of the sea-kings, threatened to sweep Germany from end to end,
as it had swept the greater part of France.

The impunity with which they raided the country was due in great part to the indolent character
of the monarch. Charles the Fat, as he was entitled, who had the ambitious project of restoring
the empire of Charlemagne, and succeeded in combining France and Germany under his sceptre,
proved unable to protect his realm from the pirate rovers. Like his predecessor, Charles the
Bald of France, he tried the magic power of gold and silver, as a more effective argument than
sharpened steel, to rid him of these marauders. Siegfried, their principal leader, was bought
off with two thousand pounds of gold and twelve thousand pounds of silver, to raise which sum
Charles seized all the treasures of the churches. In consideration of this great bribe the
sea-rover consented to a truce for twelve years. His brother Gottfried was bought off in a
different method, being made Duke of Friesland and vassal of the emperor.

These concessions, however, did not put an end to the depredations of the Norsemen. There were
other leaders than the two formidable brothers, and other pirates than those under their control,
and the country was soon again invaded, a strong party advancing as far as the Moselle, where
they took and destroyed the city of Treves. This marauding band, however, dearly paid for its
depredations. While advancing through the forest of Ardennes, it was ambushed and assailed
by a furious multitude of peasants and charcoal-burners, before whose weapons ten thousand
of the Norsemen fell in death.

This revengeful act of the peasantry was followed by a treacherous deed of the emperor, which
brought renewed trouble upon the land. Eager to rid himself of his powerful and troublesome
vassal in Friesland, Charles invited Gottfried to a meeting, at which he had the Norsemen treacherously
murdered, while his brother-in-law Hugo was deprived of his sight. It was an act sure to bring
a bloody reprisal. No sooner had news of it reached the Scandinavian north than a fire of revengeful
rage swept through the land, and from every port a throng of oared galleys put to sea, bent
upon bloody retribution. Soon in immense hordes they fell upon the imperial realm, forcing
their way in mighty hosts up the Rhine, the Maese, and the Seine, and washing out the memory
of Gottfried's murder in torrents of blood, while the brand spread ruin far and wide.

The chief attack was made on Paris, which the Norsemen invested and besieged for a year and
a half. The march upon Paris was made by sea and land, the marauders making Rouen their place
of rendezvous. From this centre of operations Rollo--the future conqueror and Duke of Normandy,
now a formidable sea-king--led an overland force towards the French capital, and on his way
was met by an envoy from the emperor, no less a personage than the Count of Chartres, the once
redoubtable Hasting, now a noble of the empire.

"Valiant sirs," he said to Rollo and his chiefs, "who are you that come hither, and why have
you come?" 

He was now be aroused out from these content there were by exclamation
from Harlow.'look back!

said Philpot.'made out into 1307 paper,'replied Harlow', here be.'some
greatest of how them are,'told Barrington,'and some are manufactured
near cloth and told into Sunday clothes for working men.



The plundering incursions continued, and soon afterwards the new emperor, Arnulf, nephew of
Charles the Fat, a man of far superior energy to his deposed uncle, attacked a powerful force
of the piratical invaders near Louvain, where they had encamped after a victory over the Archbishop
of Mayence. In the heat of the battle that followed, the vigilant Arnulf perceived that the
German cavalry fought at a disadvantage with their stalwart foes, whose dexterity as foot-soldiers
was remarkable. Springing from his horse, he called upon his followers to do the same. They
obeyed, the nobles and their men-at-arms leaping to the ground and rushing furiously on foot
upon their opponents. The assault was so fierce and sudden that the Norsemen gave way, and
were cut down in thousands, Siegfried and Gottfried--a new Gottfried apparently--falling on
the field, while the channel of the Dyle, across which the defeated invaders sought to fly,
was choked with their corpses.

This bloody defeat put an end to the incursions of the Norsemen by way of the Rhine. Thenceforward
they paid their attention to the coast of France, which they continued to invade until one
of their great leaders, Rollo, settled in Normandy as a vassal of the French monarch, and served
as an efficient barrier against the inroads of his countrymen.

As to Hasting, he appears to have returned to his old trade of sea-rover, and we hear of him
again as one of the Norse invaders of England, during the latter part of the reign of Alfred
the Great.

THE CAREER OF BISHOP HATTO.

We have now to deal with a personage whose story is largely legendary, particularly that of
his death, a highly original termination to his career having arisen among the people, who
had grown to detest him. But Bishop Hatto played his part in the history as well as in the
legend of Germany, and the curious stories concerning him may have been based on the deeds
of his actual life. It was in the beginning of the tenth century that this notable churchman
flourished as Archbishop of Mayence, and the emperor-maker of his times. In connection with
Otho, Duke of Saxony, he placed Louis, surnamed the Child,--for he was but seven years of age,--on
the imperial throne, and governed Germany in his name. Louis died in 911, while still a boy,
and with him ended the race of Charlemagne in Germany. Conrad, Duke of Franconia, was chosen
king to succeed him, but the astute churchman still remained the power behind the throne.

In truth, the influence and authority of the church at that time was enormous, and many of
its potentates troubled themselves more about the affairs of the earth than those of heaven.
Hatto, while a zealous churchman, was a bold, energetic, and unscrupulous statesman, and raised
himself to an almost unlimited power in France and Southern Germany by his arts and influence,
Otho of Saxony aiding him in his progress to power. Two of his opponents, Henry and Adelhart,
of Babenberg, took up arms against him, and came to their deaths in consequence. Adalbert,
the opponent of the Norsemen, was his next antagonist, and Hatto, through his influence in
the diet, had him put under the ban of the empire.

Adalbert, however, vigorously resisted this decree, taking up arms in his own defence, and
defeating his opponent in the field. But soon, being closely pressed, he retired to his fortress
of Bamberg, which was quickly invested and besieged. Here he defended himself with such energy
that Hatto, finding that the outlawed noble was not to be easily subdued by force, adopted
against him those spiritual weapons, as he probably considered them, in which he was so trained
an adept.

Historians tell us that the priest, with a pretence of friendly purpose, offered to mediate
between Adalbert and his enemies, promising him, if he would leave his stronghold to appear
before the assembled nobles of the diet, that he should have a free and safe return. Adalbert
accepted the terms, deeming that he could safely trust the pledged word of a high dignitary
of the church. Leaving the gates of his castle, he was met at a short distance beyond by the
bishop, who accosted him in his friendliest tone, and proposed that, as their journey would
be somewhat long, they should breakfast together within the castle before starting.

Adalbert assented and returned to the fortress with his smooth-tongued companion, took breakfast
with him, and then set out with him for the diet. Here he was sternly called to answer for
his acts of opposition to the decree of the ruling body of Germany, and finding that the tide
of feeling was running strongly against him, proposed to return to his fortress in conformity
with the plighted faith of Bishop Hatto. Hatto, with an aspect of supreme honesty, declared
that he had already fulfilled his promise. He had agreed that Adalbert should have a free and
safe return to his castle. This had been granted him. He had returned there to breakfast without
opposition of any sort. The word of the bishop had been fully kept, and now, as a member of
the diet, he felt free to act as he deemed proper, all his obligations to the accused having
been fulfilled. Just how far this story accords with the actual facts we are unable to say,
but Adalbert, despite his indignant protest, was sentenced to death and beheaded.

Hatto had reached his dignity in the church by secular instead of ecclesiastic influence, and
is credited with employing his power in this and other instances with such lack of honor and
probity that he became an object of the deepest popular contempt and execration. His name was
derided in the popular ballads, and he came to be looked upon as the scapegoat of the avarice
and licentiousness of the church in that irreligious mediæval age. Among the legends concerning
him is one relating to Henry, the son of his ally, Otho of Saxony, who died in 912. Henry had
long quarrelled with the bishop, and the fabulous story goes that, to get rid of his high-spirited
enemy, the cunning churchman sent him a gold chain, so skilfully contrived that it would strangle
its wearer.

The most famous legend about Hatto, however, is that which tells the manner of his death. The
story has been enshrined in poetry by Longfellow, but we must be content to give it in plain
prose. It tells us that a famine occurred in the land, and that a number of peasants came to
the avaricious bishop to beg for bread. By his order they were shut up in a great barn, which
then was set on fire, and its miserable occupants burned to death.

And now the cup of Hatto's infamy was filled, and heaven sent him retribution. From the ruins
of the barn issued a myriad of mice, which pursued the remorseless bishop, ceaselessly following
him in his every effort to escape their avenging teeth. At length the wretched sinner, driven
to despair, fled for safety to a strong tower standing in the middle of the Rhine, near Bingen,
with the belief that the water would protect him from his swarming foes. But the mice swam
the stream, invaded the tower, and devoured the miserable fugitive. As evidence of the truth
of this story we are shown the tower, still standing, and still known as the Mäusethurm, or
Mouse Tower. It must be said, however, that this tradition probably refers to another Bishop
Hatto, of somewhat later date. Its utterly fabulous character, of course, will be recognisable
by all.

So much for Bishop Hatto and his fate. He save a being.

 By another we are told that the Greeks recognized him, that he enticed them to the shore
by requesting them to take on board his wife and treasures, which had been left at Rossano,
and that he sent young men on board disguised as female attendants of his wife, by whose aid
he seized the vessel. All the stories agree, however, in saying that Theophania jeeringly asked
the emperor whether her countrymen had not put him in mortal fear,--a jest for which the Germans
never forgave her.

To return to the domain of fact, we have but further to tell that the emperor, full of grief
and vexation at the loss of his army, and the slaughter of many of the German and Italian princes
and nobles who had accompanied him, returned to upper Italy, with the purpose of collecting
another army.

All his conquests in the south had fallen again into the hands of the enemy, and his work remained
to be done over again. He held a grand assembly in Verona, in which he had his son Otho, three
years old, elected as his successor. From there he proceeded to Rome, in which city he was
attacked by a violent fever, brought on by the grief and excitement into which his reverses
had thrown his susceptible and impatient mind. He died December 7, 983, and was buried in the
church of St. Peter, at Rome.

The fancy of the chroniclers has surrounded his death with legends, which are worth repeating
as curious examples of what mediæval writers offered and mediæval readers accepted as history.
One of them tells the story of a naval engagement between Otho and the Greeks, in which the
fight was so bitter that the whole sea around the vessels was stained red with blood. The emperor
won the victory, but received a mortal wound.

Another story, which does not trouble itself to sail very close to the commonplace, relates
that Otho met his end by being whipped to death on Mount Garganus by the angels, among whom
he had imprudently ventured while they were holding a conclave there. These stories will serve
as examples of the degree of credibility of many of the ancient chronicles and the credulity
of their readers.

THE FORTUNES OF HENRY THE FOURTH.

At the festival of Easter, in the year 1062, a great banquet was given in the royal palace
at Kaiserswerth, on the Rhine. The Empress Agnes, widow of Henry III., and regent of the empire,
was present, with her son, then a boy of eleven. A pious and learned woman was the empress,
but she lacked the energy necessary to control the unquiet spirits of her times. Gentleness
and persuasion were the means by which she hoped to influence the rude dukes and haughty archbishops
of the empire, but qualities such as these were wasted on her fierce subjects, and served but
to gain her the contempt of some and the dislike of others. A plot to depose the weakly-mild
regent and govern the empire in the name of the youthful monarch was made by three men, Otto
of Norheim, the greatest general of the state, Ekbert of Meissen, its most valiant knight,
and Hanno, Archbishop of Cologne, its leading churchman. These three men were present at the
banquet, which they had fixed upon as the occasion for carrying out their plot.

The feast over, the three men rose and walked with the boy monarch to a window of the palace
that overlooked the Rhine. On the waters before them rode at anchor a handsome vessel, which
the child looked upon with eyes of delight.

"Would you like to see it closer?" asked Hanno. "I will take you on board, if you wish."

"Oh, will you?" pleaded the boy. "I shall be so glad."

The three conspirators walked with him to the stream, and rowed out to the vessel, the empress
viewing them without suspicion of their design. But her doubts were aroused when she saw that
the anchor had been raised and that the sails of the vessel were being set. I love'em, the supple-shanked lad,'the

The emperor, thereupon, called the rival pope, Clement, to Rome, was crowned by him, and returned
to Germany, leaving Clement in the papal chair and Gregory still shut up in St. Angelo.

But a change quickly took place in the fortunes of the indomitable old pope. Robert Guiscard,
Duke of Normandy, who had won for himself a principality in lower Italy, now marched to the
relief of his friend Gregory, stormed and took the city at the head of his Norman freebooters,
and at once began the work of pillage, in disregard of Gregory's remonstrances. The result
was an unusual one. The citizens of Rome, made desperate by their losses, gathered in multitudes
and drove the plunderers from their city, and Gregory with them. The Normans, thus expelled,
took the pope to Salerno, where he died the following year, 1085, his last words being, "I
have loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore do I die in exile."

As for his imperial enemy, the remainder of his life was one of incessant war. Years of battle
were needed to put down his enemies in the state, and his triumph was quickly followed by the
revolt of his own son, Henry, who reduced his father so greatly that the old emperor was thrown
into prison and forced to sign an abdication of the throne. It is said that he became subsequently
so reduced that he was forced to sell his boots to obtain means of subsistence, but this story
may reasonably be doubted. Henry died in 1106, again under excommunication, so that he was
not formally buried in consecrated ground until 1111, the interdict being continued for five
years after his death.

ANECDOTES OF MEDIÆVAL GERMANY.

THE WIVES OF WEINSBERG.

In the year of grace 1140 a German army, under Conrad III., emperor, laid siege to the small
town of Weinsberg, the garrison of which resisted with a most truculent and disloyal obstinacy.
Germany, which for centuries before and after was broken into warring factions, to such extent
that its emperors could truly say, "uneasy lies the head that wears a crown," was then divided
between the two strong parties of the Welfs and the Waiblingers,--or the Guelphs and the Ghibellines,
as pronounced by the Italians and better known to us. The Welfs were a noble family whose ancestry
could be traced back to the days of Charlemagne. The Waiblingers derived their name from the
town of Waiblingen, which belonged to the Hohenstaufen family, of which the Emperor Conrad
was a representative.

And now, as often before and after, the Guelphs, and Ghibellines were at war, Duke Welf holding
Weinsberg vigorously against his foes of the imperial party, while his relative, Count Welf
of Altorf, marched to his relief. A battle ensued between emperor and count, which ended in
the triumph of the emperor and the flight of the count. And this battle is worthy of mention,
as distinguished from the hundreds of battles which are unworthy of mention, from the fact
that in it was first heard a war-cry which continued famous for centuries afterwards. The German
war-cry preceding this period had been "Kyrie Eleison" ("Lord, have mercy upon us!" a pious
invocation hardly in place with men who had little mercy upon their enemies). But now the cry
of the warring factions became "Hie Weif," "Hie Waiblinger," softened in Italy into "The Guelph,"
"The Ghibelline," battle-shouts which were long afterwards heard on the field of German war,
and on that of Italy as well, for the factions of Germany became also the factions of this
southern realm.

So much for the origin of Guelph and Ghibelline, of which we may further say that a royal representative
of the former party still exists, in King Edward VII. of England, who traces his descent from
the German Welfs. And now to return to the siege of Weinsberg, to which Conrad returned after
having disposed of the army of relief. The garrison still were far from being in a submissive
mood, their defence being so obstinate, and the siege so protracted, that the emperor, incensed
by their stubborn resistance, vowed that he would make their city a frightful example to all
his foes, by subjecting its buildings to the brand and its inhabitants to the sword. Fire and
steel, he said, should sweep it from the face of the earth.

Weinsberg at length was compelled to yield, and Conrad, hot with anger, determined that his
cruel resolution should be carried out to the letter, the men being put to the sword, the city
given to the flames. This harsh decision filled the citizens with terror and despair. A deputation
was sent to the angry emperor, humbly praying for pardon, but he continued inflexible, the
utmost concession he would make being that the women might withdraw, as he did not war with
them. As for the men, they had offended him beyond forgiveness, and the sword should be their
lot. On further solicitation, he added to the concession a proviso that the women might take
away with them all that they could carry of their most precious possessions, since he did not
wish to throw them destitute upon the world.

The obdurate emperor was to experience an unexampled surprise. When the time fixed for the
departure of the women arrived, and the city gates were thrown open for their exit, to the
astonishment of Conrad, and the admiration of the whole army, the first to appear was the duchess,
who, trembling under the weight, bore upon her shoulders Duke Welf, her husband. After her
came a long line of other women, each bending beneath the heavy burden of her husband, or some
dear relative among the condemned citizens.

Never had such a spectacle been seen. So affecting an instance of heroism was it, and so earnest
and pathetic were the faces appealingly upturned to him, that the emperor's astonishment quickly
changed to admiration, and he declared that women like these had fairly earned their reward,
and that each should keep the treasure she had borne. (he spells out with a day.) "for yer crawlin,'he lick-spittle carneyin'ways,

Henry, the bishop of Utrecht, was at sword's point with two lords, those of Aemstel and Woerden,
who hated him from the fact that a kinsman of theirs, Goswin by name, had been deposed from
the same see, through the action of a general chapter. In reprisal these lords, in alliance
with the Count of Gebria, raided and laid waste the lands of the bishopric. Time and again
they visited it with plundering bands, Henry manfully opposing them with his followers, but
suffering much from their incursions. At length the affair ended in a peculiar compact, in
which both sides agreed to submit their differences to the wager of war, in a pitched battle,
which was to be held on a certain day in the green meadows adjoining Utrecht.

When the appointed day came both sides assembled with their vassals, the lords full of hope,
the bishop exhorting his followers to humble the arrogance of these plundering nobles. The
Archbishop of Cologne was in the city of Utrecht at the time, having recently visited it. He,
as warlike in disposition as the bishop himself, gave Henry a precious ring, saying to him,--

"My son, be courageous and confident, for this day, through the intercession of the holy confessor
St. Martin, and through the virtue of this ring, thou shalt surely subdue the pride of thy
adversaries, and obtain a renowned victory over them. In the meantime, while thou art seeking
justice, I will faithfully defend this city, with its priests and canons, in thy behalf, and
will offer up prayers to the Lord of Hosts for thy success."

Bishop Henry, his confidence increased by these words, led from the gates a band of fine and
well armed warriors to the sound of warlike trumpets, and marched to the field, where he drew
them up before the bands of the hostile lords.

Meanwhile, tidings of this fray had been borne to William, king of the Romans, who felt it
his duty to put an end to it, as such private warfare was forbidden by law. Hastily collecting
all the knights and men-at-arms he could get together without delay, he marched with all speed
to Utrecht, bent upon enforcing peace between the rival bands. Next, as nowadays as i get forever,

 For five years Milan lay in ruins, a home
for owls and bats, a scene of desolation to make all observers weep; and then arrived its season
of retribution. Frederick's downfall came from the hand of God, not of man. A frightful plague
broke out in the ranks of the German army, then in Rome, carrying off nobles and men alike
in such numbers that it looked as if the whole host might be laid in the grave. Thousands died,
and the emperor was obliged to retire to Pavia with but a feeble remnant of his numerous army,
nearly the whole of it having been swept away. In the following spring he was forced to leave
Italy like a fugitive, secretly and in disguise, and came so nearly falling into the hands
of his foes, that he only escaped by one of his companions placing himself in his bed, to be
seized in his stead, while he fled under cover of the night.

Immediately the humbled cities raised their heads. An alliance was formed between them, and
they even ventured to conduct the Milanese back to their ruined homes. At once the work of
rebuilding was begun. The ditches, walls, and towers were speedily restored, and then each
man went to work on his own habitation. So great was the city that the work of destruction
had been but partial. Most of the houses, all the churches, and portions of the walls remained,
and by aid of the other cities Milan soon regained its old condition.

In 1174 Frederick reappeared in Italy, with a new army, and with hostile intentions against
the revolted cities. The Lombards had built a new city, in a locality surrounded by rivers
and marshes, and had enclosed it with walls which they sought to make impregnable. This they
named Alexandria, in honor of the pope and in defiance of the emperor, and against this Frederick's
first assault was made. For seven months he besieged it, and then broke into the very heart
of the place, through a subterranean passage which the Germans had excavated. To all appearance
the city was lost, yet chance and courage saved it. The brave defenders attacked the Germans,
who had appeared in the market-place; the tunnel, through great good fortune, fell in; and
in the end the emperor was forced to raise the siege in such haste that he set fire to his
own encampment in his precipitate retreat.

On May 29, 1176, a decisive battle was fought at Lignano, in which Milan revenged itself on
its too-rigorous enemy. The Carocium was placed in the middle of the Lombard army, surrounded
by three hundred youths, who had sworn to defend it unto death, and by a body of nine hundred
picked cavalry, who had taken a similar oath.

Early in the battle one wing of the Lombard army wavered under the sharp attack of the Germans,
and threw into confusion the Milanese ranks. Taking advantage of this, the emperor pressed
towards their centre, seeking to gain the Carocium, with the expectation that its capture would
convert the disorder of the Lombards into a rout. On pushed the Germans until the sacred standard
was reached, and its decorations torn down before the eyes of its sworn defenders.

This indignity to the treasured emblem of their liberties gave renewed courage to the disordered
band. Their ranks re-established, they charged upon the Germans with such furious valor as
to drive them back in disorder, cut through their lines to the emperor's station, kill his
standard-bearer by his side, and capture the imperial standard. Frederick, clad in a splendid
suit of armor, rushed against them at the head of a band of chosen knights. But suddenly he
was seen to fall from his horse and vanish under the hot press of struggling warriors that
surged back and forth around the standard.

This dire event spread instant terror through the German ranks. They broke and fled in disorder,
followed by the death-phalanx of the Carocium, who cut them down in multitudes, and drove them
back in complete disorder and defeat. For two days the emperor was mourned as slain, his unhappy
wife even assuming the robes of widowhood, when suddenly he reappeared, and all was joy again.
He had not been seriously hurt in his fall, and had with a few friends escaped in the tumult
of the defeat, and, under the protection of night, made his way with difficulty back to Pavia.

This defeat ended the efforts of Frederick against Milan, which had, through its triumph over
the great emperor, regained all its old proud position and supremacy among the Lombard cities.
The war ended with the battle of Lignano, a truce of six years being concluded between the
hostile parties. For the ensuing eight years Frederick was fully occupied in Germany, in wars
with Henry the Lion, of the Guelph faction. At the end of that time he returned to Italy, where
Milan, which he had sought so strenuously to humiliate and ruin, now became the seat of the
greatest honor he could bestow. The occasion was that of the marriage of his son Henry to Constanza,
the last heiress of Naples and Sicily of the royal Norman race. This ceremony took place in
Milan, in which city the emperor caused the iron crown of the Lombards to be placed upon the
head of his son and heir, and gave him away in marriage with the utmost pomp and festivity.
Milan had won in its great contest for life and death.

We may fitly conclude with the story of the death of the great Frederick, who, in accordance
with the character of his life, died in harness. In his old age, having put an end to the wars
in Germany and Italy, he headed a crusade to the Holy Land, from which he was never to return. If

Letter: to STEVENSON [HOTEL BELVEDERE], DAVOS, DECEMBER 12 [1880].
 It is this dread story of the fate of the Hohenstauffen imperial
house which we have now to tell.

No sooner had Frederick expired than the enemies of his house arose on every side. Conrad IV.,
his eldest son and successor, found Germany so filled with his foes that he was forced to take
refuge in Italy, where his half-brother, Manfred, Prince of Taranto, ceded to him the sovereignty
of the Italian realm, and lent him his aid to secure it. The royal brothers captured Capua
and Naples, where Conrad signalized his success by placing a bridle in the mouth of an antique
colossal horse's head, the emblem of the city. This insult made the inhabitants his implacable
foes. His success was but temporary. He died suddenly, as also did his younger brother Henry,
poisoned by his half-brother Manfred, who succeeded to the kingship of the South. But with
the Guelphs in power in Germany, and the pope his bitter foe in Italy, he was utterly unable
to establish his claim, and was forced to cede all lower Italy, except Taranto, to the pontiff.
But a new and less implacable pope being elected, the fortunes of Manfred suddenly changed,
and he was unanimously proclaimed king at Palermo in 1258.

But the misfortunes of his house were to pursue him to the end. In northern Italy, the Guelphs
were everywhere triumphant. Ezzelino, one of Frederick's ablest generals, was defeated, wounded,
and taken prisoner. He soon after died. His brother Alberich was cruelly murdered, being dragged
to death at a horse's tail. The other Ghibelline chiefs were similarly butchered, the horrible
scenes of bloodshed so working on the feelings of the susceptible Italians that many of them
did penance at the grave of Alberich, arrayed in sackcloth. From this circumstance arose the
sect of the Flagellants, who ran through the streets, lamenting, praying, and wounding themselves
with thongs, as an atonement for the sins of the world.

In southern Italy, Manfred for a while was successful. In 1259 he married Helena, the daughter
of Michael of Cyprus and Ætolia, a maiden of seventeen years, and famed far and wide for her
loveliness. So beautiful were the bridal pair, and such were the attractions of their court,
which, as in Frederick's time, was the favorite resort of distinguished poets and lovely women,
that a bard of the times declared, "Paradise has once more appeared upon earth."

Manfred, like his father and his brother Enzio, was a poet, being classed among the Minnesingers.
His marriage gave him the alliance of Greece, and the marriage of Constance, his daughter by
a former wife, to Peter of Aragon, gained him the friendship of Spain. Strengthened by these
alliances, he was able to send aid to the Ghibellines in Lombardy, who again became victorious.

The Guelphs, alarmed at Manfred's growing power, now raised a Frenchman to the papal throne,
who induced Charles of Anjou, the brother of the French monarch, to strike for the crown of
southern Italy. Charles, a gloomy, cold-blooded and cruel prince, gladly accepted the pope's
suggestions, and followed by a powerful body of French knights and soldiers of fortune, set
sail for Naples in 1266. Manfred had unluckily lost the whole of his fleet in a storm, and
was not able to oppose this threatening invasion, which landed in Italy in his despite.

Nor was he more fortunate with his land army. The clergy, in the interest of the Guelph faction,
tampered with his soldiers and sowed treason in his camp. No sooner had Charles landed, than
a mountain pass intrusted to the defence of Riccardo di Caseta was treacherously abandoned,
and the French army allowed to advance unmolested as far as Benevento, where the two armies met.

In the battle that followed, Manfred defended himself gallantly, but, despite all his efforts,
was worsted, and threw himself desperately into the thick of the fight, where he fell, covered
with wounds. The bigoted victor refused him honorable burial, on the score of heresy, but the
French soldiers, nobler-hearted than their leader, and touched by the beauty and valor of their
unfortunate opponent, cast each of them a stone upon his body, which was thus buried under
a mound which the natives still know as the "rock of roses."

The wife and children of Manfred met with a pitiable fate. On learning of the sad death of
her husband Helena sought safety in flight, with her daughter Beatrice and her three infant
sons, Henry, Frederick, and Anselino; but she was betrayed to Charles, who threw her into a
dungeon, in which she soon languished and died. Of her children, her daughter Beatrice was
afterwards rescued by Peter of Aragon, who exchanged for her a son of Charles of Anjou, whom
he held prisoner; but the three boys were given over to the cruellest fate. Immured in a narrow
dungeon, and loaded with chains, they remained thus half-naked, ill-fed, and untaught for the
period of thirty-one years. Not until 1297 were they released from their chains and allowed
to be visited by a priest and a physician. Charles of Anjou, meanwhile, filled with the spirit
of cruelty and ambition, sought to destroy every vestige of the Hohenstauffen rule in southern
Italy, the scene of Frederick's long and lustrous reign.

The death of Manfred had not extinguished all the princes of Frederick's house. There remained
another, Conradin, son of Conrad IV., Duke of Swabia, a youthful prince to whom had descended
some of the intellectual powers of his noted grand-sire. He had an inseparable friend, Frederick,
son of the Margrave of Baden, of his own age, and like him enthusiastic and imaginative, their
ardent fancies finding vent in song. One of Conradin's ballads is still extant.

As the young prince grew older, the seclusion to which he was subjected by his guardian, Meinhard,
Count von Görtz, became so irksome to him that he gladly accepted a proposal from the Italian
Ghibellines to put himself at their head. In 1267 he set out, in company with Frederick, and
with a following of some ten thousand men, and crossed the Alps to Lombardy, where he met with
a warm welcome at Verona by the Ghibelline chiefs.

Treachery accompanied him, however, in the presence of his guardian Meinhard and Louis of Bavaria,
who persuaded him to part with his German possessions for a low price, and then deserted him,
followed by the greater part of the Germans. Conradin was left with but three thousand men.

The Italians proved more faithful. Verona raised him an army; Pisa supplied him a large fleet;
the Moors of Luceria took up arms in his cause; even Rome rose in his favor, and drove out
the pope, who retreated to Viterbo. For the time being the Ghibelline cause was in the ascendant.
Conradin marched unopposed to Rome, at whose gates he was met by a procession of beautiful
girls, bearing flowers and instruments of music, who conducted him to the capitol. His success
on land was matched by a success at sea, his fleet gaining a signal victory over that of the
French, and burning a great number of their ships.

So far all had gone well with the youthful heir of the Hohenstauffens. Henceforth all was to
go ill. Conradin marched from Rome to lower Italy, where he encountered the French army, under
Charles, at Scurcola, drove them back, and broke into their camp. Assured of victory, the Germans
grew careless, dispersing through the camp in search of booty, while some of them even refreshed
themselves by bathing.

While thus engaged, the French reserve, who had watched their movements, suddenly fell upon
them and completely put them to rout. Conradin and Frederick, after fighting bravely, owed
their escape to the fleetness of their steeds. They reached the sea at Astura, boarded a vessel,
and were about setting sail for Pisa, when they were betrayed into the hands of their pursuers,
taken prisoners, and carried back to Charles of Anjou.

They had fallen into fatal hands; Charles was not the man to consider justice or honor in dealing
with a Hohenstauffen. He treated Conradin as a rebel against himself, under the claim that
he was the only legitimate king, and sentenced both the princes, then but sixteen years of
age, to be publicly beheaded in the market-place at Naples.

Conradin was playing at chess in prison when the news of this unjust sentence was brought to
him. He calmly listened to it, with the courage native to his race. On October 22, 1268, he,
with Frederick and his other companions, was conducted to the scaffold erected in the market-place,
passing through a throng of which even the French contingent looked on the spectacle with indignation.
So greatly were they wrought up, indeed, by the outrage, that Robert, Earl of Flanders, Charles's
son-in-law, drew his sword, and cut down the officer commissioned to read in public the sentence
of death.

"Wretch!" he cried, as he dealt the blow, "how darest thou condemn such a great and excellent
knight?"

Conradin met his fate with unyielding courage, saying, in his address to the people,--

"I cite my judge before the highest tribunal. My blood, shed on this spot, shall cry to heaven
for vengeance. Nor do I esteem my Swabians and Bavarians, my Germans, so low as not to trust
that this stain on the honor of the German nation will be washed out by them in French blood."

Then, throwing his glove to the ground, he charged him who should raise it to bear it to Peter,
King of Aragon, to whom, as his nearest relative, he bequeathed all his claims. The glove was
raised by Henry, Truchsess von Waldberg, who found in it the seal ring of the unfortunate wearer.
Thence-forth he bore in his arms the three black lions of the Stauffen.

In a minute more the fatal axe of the executioner descended, and the head of the last heir
of the Hohenstauffens rolled upon the scaffold. His friend, Frederick, followed him to death,
nor was the bloodthirsty Charles satisfied until almost every Ghibelline in his hands had fallen
by the hand of the executioner.

Enzio, the unfortunate son of Frederick who was held prisoner by the Bolognese, was involved
in the fate of his unhappy nephew. On learning of the arrival of Conradin in Italy he made
an effort to escape from prison, which would have been successful but for an unlucky accident.
He had arranged to conceal himself in a cask, which was to be borne out of the prison by his
friends, but by an unfortunate chance one of his long, golden locks fell out of the air-hole
which had been made in the side of the cask, and revealed the stratagem to his keepers.

During his earlier imprisonment Enzio had been allowed some alleviation, his friends being
permitted to visit him and solace him in his seclusion; but after this effort to escape he
was closely confined, some say, in an iron cage, until his death in 1272.

Thus ended the royal race of the Hohenstauffen, a race marked by unusual personal beauty, rich
poetical genius, and brilliant warlike achievements, and during whose period of power the mediæval
age and its institutions attained their highest development.

As for the ruthless Charles of Anjou, he retained Apulia, but lost his possessions in Sicily
through an event which has become famous as the "Sicilian Vespers." The insolence and outrages
of the French had so exasperated the Sicilians that, on the night of March 30, 1282, a general
insurrection broke out in this island, the French being everywhere assassinated. Constance,
the grand-daughter of their old ruler, and Peter of Aragon, her husband, were proclaimed their
sovereigns by the Sicilians, and Charles, the son of Charles of Anjou, fell into their hands.

Constance was generous to the captive prince, and on hearing him remark that he was happy to
die on a Friday, the day on which Christ suffered, she replied,--

"For love of him who suffered on this day I will grant thee thy life."

He was afterwards exchanged for Beatrice, the daughter of the unhappy Helena, whose sons, the
last princes of the Hohenstauffen race, died in the prison in which they had lived since infancy.

THE TRIBUNAL OF THE HOLY VEHM.

The ideas of law and order in mediæval Germany were by no means what we now understand by those
terms. The injustice of the strong and the suffering of the weak were the rule; and men of
noble lineage did not hesitate to turn their castles into dens of thieves. The title "robber
baron," which many of them bore, sufficiently indicates their mode of life, and turbulence
and outrage prevailed throughout the land.

But wrong did not flourish with complete impunity; right had not entirely vanished; justice
still held its sword, and at times struck swift and deadly blows that filled with terror the
wrong-doer, and gave some assurance of protection to those too weak for self-defence. It was
no unusual circumstance to behold, perhaps in the vicinity of some baronial castle, perhaps
near some town or manorial residence, a group of peasants gazing upwards with awed but triumphant
eyes; the spectacle that attracted their attention being the body of a man hanging from the
limb of a tree above their heads.

 "Uri's
prison" he called this fortress, an insult to the people of Uri which roused their indignation.
Perceiving their sullenness, Gessler resolved to give them a salutary lesson of his power and
their helplessness.

On St. Jacob's day he had a pole erected in the market-place at Altdorf, under the lime-trees
there growing, and directed that his hat should be placed on its top. This done, the command
was issued that all who passed through the market-place should bow and kneel to this hat as
to the king himself, blows and confiscation of property to be the lot of all who refused. A
guard was placed around the pole, whose duty was to take note of every man who should fail
to do homage to the governor's hat.

On the Sunday following, a peasant of Uri, William Tell by name, who, as we are told, was one
of the thirty-three sworn confederates, passed several times through the market-place at Altdorf
without bowing or bending the knee to Gessler's hat. This was reported to the governor, who
summoned Tell to his presence, and haughtily asked him why he had dared to disobey his command.

"My dear lord," answered Tell, submissively, "I beg you to pardon me, for it was done through
ignorance and not out of contempt. If I were clever, I should not be called Tell. I pray your
mercy; it shall not happen again."

The name Tell signifies dull or stupid, a meaning in consonance with his speech, though not
with his character. Yet stupid or bright, he had the reputation of being the best archer in
the country, and Gessler, knowing this, determined on a singular punishment for his fault.
Tell had beautiful children, whom he dearly loved. The governor sent for these, and asked him,--

"Which of your children do you love the best?"

"My lord, they are all alike dear to me," answered Tell.

"If that be so," said Gessler, "then, as I hear that you are a famous marksman, you shall prove
your skill in my presence by shooting an apple off the head of one of your children. But take
good care to hit the apple, for if your first shot miss you shall lose your life."

"For God's sake, do not ask me to do this!" cried Tell in horror. "It would be unnatural to
shoot at my own dear child. I would rather die than do it."

"Unless you do it, you or your child shall die," answered the governor harshly.

Tell, seeing that Gessler was resolute in his cruel project, and that the trial must be made
or worse might come, reluctantly agreed to it. He took his cross-bow and two arrows, one of
which he placed in the bow, the other he stuck behind in his collar. The governor, meanwhile,
had selected the child for the trial, a boy of not more than six years of age, whom he ordered
to be placed at the proper distance, and himself selected an apple and placed it on the child's
head.

Tell viewed these preparations with startled eyes, while praying inwardly to God to shield
his dear child from harm. Then, bidding the boy to stand firm and not be frightened, as his
father would do his best not to harm him, he raised the perilous bow.

The legend deals too briefly with this story. It fails to picture the scene in the market-place.
But there, we may be sure, in addition to Gessler and his guards, were most of the people of
Uri, their hearts burning with sympathy for their countryman and hatred of the tyrant, their
feelings almost wrought up to the point of attacking Gessler and his guards, and daring death
in defence of their liberties. There also we may behold in fancy the brave child, scarcely
old enough to appreciate the magnitude of his peril, but looking with simple faith into the
kind eyes of his father, who stands firm of frame but trembling in heart before him, the death-dealing
bow in his hand.

In a minute more the bow is bent, Tell's unerring eye glances along the shaft, the string twangs
sharply, the arrow speeds through the air, and the apple, pierced through its centre, is borne
from the head of the boy, who leaps forward with a glad cry of triumph, while the unnerved
father, with tears of joy in his eyes, flings the bow to the ground and clasps his child to
his heart.

"By my faith, Tell, that is a wonderful shot!" cried the astonished governor. "Men have not
belied you. But why have you stuck another arrow in your collar?"

"That is the custom among marksmen," Tell hesitatingly answered.

"Come, man, speak the truth openly and without fear," said Gessler, who noted Tell's hesitancy.
"Your life is safe; but I am not satisfied with your answer."

"Then," said Tell, regaining his courage, "if you would have the truth, it is this. If I had
struck my child with the first arrow, the other was intended for you; and with that I should
not have missed my mark."

The governor started at these bold words, and his brow clouded with anger.

"I promised you your life," he exclaimed, "and will keep my word; but, as you cherish evil
intentions against me, I shall make sure that you cannot carry them out. You are not safe to
leave at large, and shall be taken to a place where you can never again behold the sun or the
moon."

Turning to his guards, he bade them seize the bold marksman, bind his hands, and take him in
a boat across the lake to his castle at Küssnach, where he should do penance for his evil intentions
by spending the remainder of his life in a dark dungeon. The people dared not interfere with
this harsh sentence; the guards were too many and too well armed. Tell was seized, bound, and
hurried to the lake-side, Gessler accompanying.

The water reached, he was placed in a boat, his cross-bow being also brought and laid beside
the steersman. As if with purpose to make sure of the disposal of his threatening enemy, Gessler
also entered the boat, which was pushed off and rowed across the lake towards Brunnen, from
which place the prisoner was to be taken overland to the governor's fortress.

Before they were half-way across the lake, however, a sudden and violent storm arose, tossing
the boat so frightfully that Gessler and all with him were filled with mortal fear.

"My lord," cried one of the trembling rowers to the governor, "we will all go to the bottom
unless something is done, for there is not a man among us fit to manage a boat in this storm.
But Tell here is a skilful boatman, and it would be wise to use him in our sore need."

"Can you bring us out of this peril?" asked Gessler, who was no less alarmed than his crew.
"If you can, I will release you from your bonds."

"I trust, with God's help, that I can safely bring you ashore," answered Tell.

By Gessler's order his bonds were then removed, and he stepped aft and took the helm, guiding
the boat through the storm with the skill of a trained mariner. He had, however, another object
in view, and had no intention to let the tyrannical governor bind his free limbs again. He
bade the men to row carefully until they reached a certain rock, which appeared on the lake-side
at no great distance, telling them that he hoped to land them behind its shelter. As they drew
near the spot indicated, he turned the helm so that the boat struck violently against the rock,
and then, seizing the cross-bow which lay beside him, he sprang nimbly ashore, and thrust the
boat with his foot back into the tossing waves. The rock on which he landed is, says the chronicler,
still known as Tell's Rock, and a small chapel has been built upon it.

The story goes on to tell us that the governor and his rowers, after great danger, finally
succeeded in reaching the shore at Brunnen, at which point they took horse and rode through
the district of Schwyz, their route leading through a narrow passage between the rocks, the
only way by which they could reach Küssnach from that quarter. On they went, the angry governor
swearing vengeance against Tell, and laying plans with his followers how the runaway should
be seized. The deepest dungeon at Küssnach, he vowed, should be his lot.

He little dreamed what ears heard his fulminations and what deadly peril threatened him. On
leaving the boat, Tell had run quickly forward to the passage, or hollow way, through which
he knew that Gessler must pass on his way to the castle. Here, hidden behind the high bank
that bordered the road, he waited, cross-bow in hand, and the arrow which he had designed for
the governor's life in the string, for the coming of his mortal foe.

Gessler came, still talking of his plans to seize Tell, and without a dream of danger, for
the pass was silent and seemed deserted. But suddenly to his ears came the twang of the bow
he had heard before that day; through the air once more winged its way a steel-barbed shaft,
the heart of a tyrant, not an apple on a child's head, now its mark. In an instant more Gessler
fell from his horse, pierced by Tell's fatal shaft, and breathed his last before the eyes of
his terrified servants. On that spot, the chronicler concludes, was built a holy chapel, which
is standing to this day.

Such is the far-famed story of William Tell. How much truth and how much mere tradition there
is in it, it is not easy to say. The feat of shooting an apple from a person's head is told
of others before Tell's time, and that it ever happened is far from sure. But at the same time
it is possible that the story of Tell, in its main features, may be founded on fact. Tradition
is rarely all fable.

We are now done with William Tell, and must return to the doings of the three confederates
to whom fame ascribes the origin of the liberty of Switzerland. In the early morning of January
1, 1308, the date they had fixed for their work to begin, as Landenberg was leaving his castle
to attend mass at Sarnen, he was met by twenty of the mountaineers of Unterwald, who, as was
their custom, brought him a new-year's gift of calves, goats, sheep, fowls, and hares. Much
pleased with the present, he asked the men to take the animals into the castle court, and went
on his way towards Sarnen.

But no sooner had the twenty men passed through the gates than a horn was loudly blown, and
instantly each of them drew from beneath his doublet a steel blade, which he fixed upon the
end of his staff. At the sound of the horn thirty other men rushed from a neighboring wood,
and made for the open gates. In a very few minutes they joined their comrades in the castle,
which was quickly theirs, the garrison being overpowered.

Landenberg fled in haste on hearing the tumult, but was pursued and taken. But as the confederates
had agreed with each other to shed no blood, they suffered this arch villain to depart, after
making him swear to leave Switzerland and never return to it. The news of the revolt spread
rapidly through the mountains, and so well had the confederates laid their plans, that several
other castles were taken by stratagem before the alarm could be given. Their governors were
sent beyond the borders. Day by day news was brought to the head-quarters of the patriots,
on Lake Lucerne, of success in various parts of the country, and on Sunday, the 7th of January,
a week from the first outbreak, the leading men of that part of Switzerland met and pledged
themselves to their ancient oath of confederacy. In a week's time they had driven out the Austrians
and set their country free.

It must be admitted that there is no contemporary proof of this story, though the Swiss accept
it as authentic history, and it has not been disproved. The chief peril to the new confederacy
lay with Albert of Austria, the dispossessed lord of the land, but the patriotic Swiss found
themselves unexpectedly relieved from the execution of his threats of vengeance. His harshness
and despotic severity had made him enemies alike among people and nobles, and when, in the
spring of 1308, he sought the borders of Switzerland, with the purpose of reducing and punishing
the insurgents, his career was brought to a sudden and violent end.

A conspiracy had been formed against him by his nephew, the Duke of Swabia, and others who
accompanied him in this journey. On the 1st of May they reached the Reuss River at Windisch,
and, as the emperor entered the boat to be ferried across, the conspirators pushed into it
after him, leaving no room for his attendants. The only wonder is, how he and had the final,

 Born to the throne, he was crowned
King of Bohemia when but three years of age, was elected King of the Romans at fifteen, and
two years afterwards, in 1378, became Emperor of Germany, when still but a boy, with regard
for nothing but riot and rude frolic.

So far as affairs of state were concerned, the volatile youth either totally neglected them
or treated them with a ridicule that was worse than neglect. Drunk two-thirds of his time,
he now dismissed the most serious matters with a rude jest, now met his councillors with brutal
fits of rage. The Germans deemed him a fool, and were not far amiss in their opinion; but as
he did not meddle with them, except in holding an occasional useless diet at Nuremberg, they
did not meddle with him. The Bohemians, among whom he lived, his residence being at Prague,
found his rule much more of a burden. They were exposed to his savage caprices, and regarded
him as a brutal and senseless tyrant.

That there was method in his madness the following anecdote will sufficiently show. Former
kings had invested the Bohemian nobles with possessions which he, moved by cupidity, determined
to have back. This is the method he took to obtain them. All the nobles of the land were invited
to meet him at Willamow, where he received them in a black tent, which opened on one side into
a white, and on the other into a red one. Into this tent of ominous hue the waiting nobles
were admitted, one at a time, and were here received by the emperor, who peremptorily bade
them declare what lands they held as gifts from the crown.

The plan adopted was that the dismounted knights and soldiers should join their ranks as closely
as possible, until their front presented an unbroken wall of iron, and thus arrayed should
charge the enemy spear in hand. Leaving their attendants in charge of their horses, the serried
column of footmen prepared to advance, confident of sweeping their foes to death before their
closely-knit line of spears.

Yet this plan of battle was not without its critics. The Baron of Hasenburg, a veteran soldier,
looked on it with disfavor, as contrasted with the position of vantage occupied by the Swiss,
and cautioned the duke and his nobles against undue assurance.

"Pride never served any good purpose in peace or war," he said. "We had much better wait until
the infantry come up."

This prudent advice was received with shouts of derision by the nobles, some of whom cried
out insultingly,--

"Der Hasenburg hat ein Hasenherz" ("Hasenburg has a hare's heart," a play upon the baron's name).

Certain nobles, however, who had not quite lost their prudence, tried to persuade the duke
to keep in the rear, as the true position for a leader. He smiled proudly in reply, and exclaimed
with impatience,--

"What! shall Leopold be a mere looker-on, and calmly behold his knights die around him in his
own cause? Never! here on my native soil with you I will conquer or perish with my people."
So saying, he placed himself at the head of the troops.

And now the decisive moment was at hand. The Swiss had kept to the heights while their enemy
continued mounted, not venturing to face such a body of cavalry on level ground. But when they
saw them forming as foot-soldiers, they left the hills and marched to the plain below. Soon
the unequal forces confronted each other; the Swiss, as was their custom, falling upon their
knees and praying for God's aid to their cause; the Austrians fastening their helmets and preparing
for the fray. The duke even took the occasion to give the honor of knighthood to several young
warriors.

The day was a hot and close one, the season being that of harvest, and the sun pouring down
its unclouded and burning rays upon the combatants. This sultriness was a marked advantage
to the lightly-dressed mountaineers as compared with the armor-clad knights, to whom the heat
was very oppressive.

The battle was begun by the Swiss, who, on rising from their knees, flung themselves with impetuous
valor on the dense line of spears that confronted them. Their courage and fury were in vain.
Not a man in the Austrian line wavered. They stood like a rock against which the waves of the
Swiss dashed only to be hurled back in death. The men of Lucerne, in particular, fought with
an almost blind rage, seeking to force a path through that steel-pointed forest of spears,
and falling rapidly before the triumphant foe.

Numbers of the mountaineers lay dead or wounded. The line of spears seemed impenetrable. The
Swiss began to waver. The enemy, seeing this, advanced the flanks of his line so as to form
a half-moon shape, with the purpose of enclosing the small body of Swiss within a circle of
spears. It looked for the moment as if the struggle were at an end, the mountaineers foiled
and defeated, the fetters again ready to be locked upon the limbs of free Switzerland.

But such was not to be. There was a man in that small band of patriots who had the courage
to accept certain death for his country, one of those rare souls who appear from time to time
in the centuries and win undying fame by an act of self-martyrdom. Arnold of Winkelried was
his name, a name which history is not likely soon to forget, for by an impulse of the noblest
devotion this brave patriot saved the liberties of his native land.

Seeing that there was but one hope for the Swiss, and that death must be the lot of him who
gave them that hope, he exclaimed to his comrades, in a voice of thunder,--

"Faithful and beloved confederates, I will open a passage to freedom and victory! Protect my
wife and children!"

With these words, he rushed from his ranks, flung himself upon the enemy's steel-pointed line,
and seized with his extended arms as many of the hostile spears as he was able to grasp, burying
them in his body, and sinking dead to the ground.

His comrades lost not a second in availing themselves of this act of heroic devotion. Darting
forward, they rushed over the body of the martyr to liberty into the breach he had made, forced
others of the spears aside, and for the first time since the fray began reached the Austrians
with their weapons.

A hasty and ineffective effort was made to close the breach. It only added to the confusion
which the sudden assault had caused. The line of hurrying knights became crowded and disordered.
The furious Swiss broke through in increasing numbers. Overcome with the heat, many of the
knights fell from exhaustion, and died without a wound, suffocated in their armor. Others fell
below the blows of the Swiss. The line of spears, so recently intact, was now broken and pierced
at a dozen points, and the revengeful mountaineers were dealing death upon their terrified
and feebly-resisting foes.

The chief banner of the host had twice sunk and been raised again, and was drooping a third
time, when Ulric, a knight of Aarburg, seized and lifted it, defending it desperately till
a mortal blow laid him low.

"Save Austria! rescue!" he faltered with his dying breath.

Duke Leopold, who was pushing through the confused throng, heard him and caught the banner
from his dying hand. Again it waved aloft, but now crimsoned with the blood of its defender.

The Swiss, determined to capture it, pressed upon its princely bearer, surrounded him, cut
down on every side the warriors who sought to defend him and the standard.

"Since so many nobles and knights have ended their days in my cause, let me honorably follow
them," cried the despairing duke, and in a moment he rushed into the midst of the hostile ranks,
vanishing from the eyes of his attendants. Blows rained on his iron mail. In the pressure of
the crowd he fell to the earth. While seeking to raise himself again in his heavy armor, he
cried, in his helpless plight, to a Swiss soldier, who had approached him with raised weapon,--

"I am the Prince of Austria."

The man either heard not his words, or took no heed of princes. The weapon descended with a
mortal blow. Duke Leopold of Austria was dead.

The body of the slain duke was found by a knight, Martin Malterer, who bore the banner of Freiburg.
On recognizing him, he stood like one petrified, let the banner fall from his hand, and then
threw himself on the body of the prince, that it might not be trampled under foot by the contending
forces. In this position he soon received his own death-wound.

By this time the state of the Austrians was pitiable. The signal for retreat was given, and
in utter terror and dismay they fled for their horses. Alas, too late! The attendants, seeing
the condition of their masters, and filled with equal terror, had mounted the horses, and were
already in full flight.

Nothing remained for the knights, oppressed with their heavy armor, exhausted with thirst and
fatigue, half suffocated with the scorching heat, assailed on every side by the light-armed
and nimble Swiss, but to sell their lives as dearly as possible. In a short time more all was
at an end. The last of the Austrians fell. On that fatal field there had met their death, at
the hands of the small body of Swiss, no less than six hundred and fifty-six knights, barons,
and counts, together with thousands of their men-at-arms.

Thus ended the battle of Sempach, with its signal victory to the Swiss, one of the most striking
which history records, if we consider the great disproportion in numbers and in warlike experience
and military equipment of the combatants. It secured to Switzerland the liberty for which they
had so valiantly struck at Morgarten seventy years before.

But all Switzerland was not yet free, and more blows were needed to win its full liberty. The
battle of Næfels, in 1388, added to the width of the free zone. In this the peasants of Glarus
rolled stones on the Austrian squadrons, and set fire to the bridges over which they fled,
two thousand five hundred of the enemy, including a great number of nobles, being slain. In
the same year the peasants of Valais defeated the Earl of Savoy at Visp, putting four thousand
of his men to the sword. The citizens of St. Gall, infuriated by the tyranny of the governor
of the province of Schwendi, broke into insurrection, attacked the castle of Schwendi, and
burnt it to the ground. The governor escaped. All the castles in the vicinity were similarly
dealt with, and the whole district set free.

Shortly after 1400 the citizens of St. Gall joined with the peasants against their abbot, who
ruled them with a hand of iron. The Swabian cities were asked to decide the dispute, and decided
that cities could only confederate with cities, not with peasants, thus leaving the Appenzellers
to their fate. At this decision the herdsmen rose in arms, defeated abbot and citizens both,
and set their country free, all the neighboring peasantry joining their band of liberty. A
few years later the people of this region joined the confederation, which now included nearly
the whole of the Alpine country, and was strong enough to maintain its liberty for centuries
thereafter. It was not again subdued until the legions of Napoleon trod over its mountain paths.

ZISKA, THE BLIND WARRIOR.

Sigismund, Emperor of Germany, had sworn to put an end to the Hussite rebellion in Bohemia,
and to punish the rebels in a way that would make all future rebels tremble. But Sigismund
was pursuing the old policy of cooking the hare before it was caught. He forgot that the indomitable
John Ziska and the iron-flailed peasantry stood between him and his vow. He had first to conquer
the reformers before he could punish them, and this was to prove no easy task.

The dreadful work of religious war began with the burning of Hussite preachers who had ventured
from Bohemia into Germany. This was an argument which Ziska thoroughly understood, and he retorted
by destroying the Bohemian monasteries, and burning the priests alive in barrels of pitch.
"They are singing my sister's wedding song," exclaimed the grim barbarian, on hearing their
cries of torture. Queen Sophia, widow of Wenceslas, the late king, who had garrisoned all the
royal castles, now sent a strong body of troops against the reformers. The army came up with
the multitude, which was largely made up of women and children, on the open plain near Pilsen.
The cavalry charged upon the seemingly helpless mob. But Ziska was equal to the occasion. He
ordered the women to strew the ground with their gowns and veils, and the horses' feet becoming
entangled in these, numbers of the riders were thrown, and the trim lines of the troops broken.

Seeing the confusion into which they had been thrown, Ziska gave the order to charge, and in
a short time the army that was to defeat him was flying in a panic across the plain, a broken
and beaten mob. Another army marched against him, and was similarly defeated; and the citizens
of Prague, finding that no satisfactory terms could be made with the emperor, recalled Ziska,
and entered into alliance with him. The one-eyed patriot was now lord of the land, all Bohemia
being at his beck and call.

Meanwhile Sigismund, the emperor, was slowly gathering his forces to invade the rebellious
land. The reign of cruelty continued, each side treating its prisoners barbarously. The Imperialists
branded theirs with a cup, the Hussites theirs with a cross, on their foreheads. The citizens
of Breslau joined those of Prague, and emulated them by flinging their councillors out of the
town-house windows. In return the German miners of Kuttenberg threw sixteen hundred Hussites
down the mines. Such is religious war, the very climax of cruelty.

In June, 1420, the threatened invasion came. Sigismund led an army, one hundred thousand strong,
into the revolted land, fulminating vengeance as he marched. He reached Prague and entered
the castle of Wisherad, which commanded it. Ziska fortified the mountain of Witlow (now called
Ziskaberg), which also commanded the city. Sigismund, finding that he had been outgeneralled,
and that his opponent held the controlling position, waited and temporized, amusing himself
meanwhile by assuming the crown of Bohemia, and sowing dissension in his army by paying the
Slavonian and Hungarian troops with the jewels taken from the royal palaces and the churches,
while leaving the Germans unpaid. The Germans, furious, marched away. The emperor was obliged
to follow. The ostentatious invasion was at an end, and scarcely a blow had been struck.

But Sigismund had no sooner gone than trouble arose in Prague. The citizens, the nobility,
and Ziska's followers were all at odds. The Taborites--those strict republicans and religious
reformers who had made Mount Tabor their head-quarters--were in power, and ruled the city with
a rod of iron, destroying all the remaining splendor of the churches and sternly prohibiting
every display of ostentation by the people. Death was named as the punishment for such venial
faults as dancing, gambling, or the wearing of rich attire. He may decrease assured that, and by receptor

LUTHER AND THE INDULGENCES.

Late in the month of April, in the year 1521, an open wagon containing two persons was driven
along one of the roads of Germany, the horse being kept at his best pace, while now and then
one of the occupants looked back as if in apprehension. This was the man who held the reins.
The other, a short but presentable person, with pale, drawn face, lit by keen eyes, seemed
too deeply buried in thought to be heedful of surrounding affairs. When he did lift his eyes
they were directed ahead, where the road was seen to enter the great Thuringian forest. Dressed
in clerical garb, the peasants who passed probably regarded him as a monk on some errand of
mercy. The truth was that he was a fugitive, fleeing for his life, for he was a man condemned,
who might at any moment be waylaid and seized.

On entering the forest the wagon was driven on until a shaded and lonely dell was reached,
seemingly a fitting place for deeds of violence. Suddenly from the forest glades rode forth
four armed and masked men, who stopped the wagon, sternly bade the traveller to descend and
mount a spare horse they had with them, and rode off with him, a seeming captive, through the
thick woodland.

As if in fear of pursuit, the captors kept at a brisk pace, not drawing rein until the walls
of a large and strong castle loomed up near the forest border. The gates flew open and the
drawbridge fell at their demand, and the small cavalcade rode into the powerful stronghold,
the entrance to which was immediately closed behind them. It was the castle of Wartburg, near
Eisenach, Saxony, within whose strong walls the man thus mysteriously carried off was to remain
hidden from the world for the greater part of the year that followed.

The monk-like captive was just then the most talked of man in Germany. His seemingly violent
capture had been made by his friends, not by his foes, its purpose being to protect him from
his enemies, who were many and threatening. Of this he was well aware, and welcomed the castle
as a place of refuge. He was, in fact, the celebrated Martin Luther, who had just set in train
a religious revolution of broad aspect in Germany, and though for the time under the protection
of a safe-conduct from the emperor Charles V., had been deemed in imminent danger of falling
into an ambush of his foes instead of one of his friends.

That he might not be recognised by those who should see him at Wartburg, his ecclesiastic robe
was exchanged for the dress of a knight, he wore helmet and sword instead of cassock and cross
and let his beard grow freely. Thus changed in appearance, he was known as Junker George (Chevalier
George) to those in the castle, and amused himself at times by hunting with his knightly companions
in the neighborhood. The greater part of his time, however, was occupied in a difficult literary
task, that of translating the Bible into German. The work thus done by him was destined to
prove as important in a linguistic as in a theological sense, since it fixed the status of
the German language for the later period to the same extent as the English translation of the
Bible in the time of James I. aided to fix that of English speech.

Leaving Luther, for the present, in his retreat at Wartburg Castle, we must go back in his
history and tell the occasion of the events just narrated. No man, before or after his time,
ever created so great a disturbance in German thought, and the career of this fugitive monk
is one of great historical import.

A peasant by birth, the son of a slate-cutter named Hans Luther, he so distinguished himself
as a scholar that his father proposed to make him a lawyer, but a dangerous illness, the death
of a near friend, and the exhortations of an eloquent preacher, so wrought upon his mind that
he resolved instead to become a monk, and after going through the necessary course of study
and mental discipline was ordained priest in May, 1507. The next year he was appointed a professor
in the university of Wittenberg. There he remained for the next ten years of his life, when
an event occurred which was to turn the whole current of his career and give him a prominence
in theological history which few other men have ever attained.

In 1517 Pope Leo X. authorized an unusually large issue of indulgences, a term which signifies
a remission of the temporal punishment due to sin, either in this life or the life to come;
the condition being that the recipient shall have made a full confession of his sins and by
his penitence and purpose of amendment fitted himself to receive the pardon of God, through
the agency of the priest. He was also required to perform some service in the aid of charity
or religion, such as the giving of alms.

At the time of the Crusades the popes had granted to all who took part in them remission from
church penalties. At a later date the same indulgence was granted to penitents who aided the
holy wars with money instead of in person. At a still later date remission from the penalties
of sin might be obtained by pious work, such as building churches, etc. When the Turks threatened
Europe, those who fought against them obtained indulgence. In the instance of the issue of
indulgences by Leo X. the pious work required was the giving of alms in aid of the completion
of the great cathedral of St. Peter's at Rome.

This purpose did not differ in character from others for which indulgences had previously been
granted, and there is nothing to show that any disregard of the requisite conditions was authorized
by the pope; but there is reason to believe that some of the agents for the disposal of these
indulgences went much beyond the intention of the decree. This was especially the case in the
instance of a Dominican monk named Tetzel, who is charged with openly asserting what few or
no other Catholics appear to have ever claimed, that the indulgences not only released the
purchasers from the necessity of penance, but absolved them from all the consequences of sin
in this world or the next.

 For twenty-eight days that insignificant fortress and its handful of men
defied the great Turkish army and held it back in that mountain-pass. In the end the sultan,
with all his pride and all his force, was obliged to accept a feigned submission and leave
Jurissitz and his men still in possession of the fortress they had held so long and so well.

They had held it long enough to save Austria, as it proved. While the sultan's cannon were
vainly bombarding its walls, Europe was gathering around Vienna in defence. From every side
troops hurried to the salvation of Austria from the Turks. Italy, the Netherlands, Bohemia.
Poland, Germany, sent their quotas, till an army of one hundred and thirty thousand men were
gathered around Vienna, thirty thousand of them being cavalry.

Solyman was appalled at the tidings brought him. It had become a question of arithmetic to
his barbarian intellect. If Guntz, with less than a thousand men, could defy him for a month,
what might not Vienna do with more than a hundred thousand? Winter was not far away. It was
already September. He was separated from his flotilla of artillery. Was it safe to advance?
He answered the question by suddenly striking camp and retreating with such haste that his
marauding horsemen, who were out in large numbers, were left in ignorance of the movement,
and were nearly all taken or cut to pieces.

Thus ingloriously ended one of the most pretentious invasions of Europe. For three years Solyman
had industriously prepared, gathering the resources of his wide dominion to the task and fulminating
infinite disaster to the infidels. Yet eight hundred men in a petty mountain town had brought
this great enterprise to naught and sent back the mighty army of the grand Turk in inglorious
retreat.

The story of Guntz has few parallels in history; the courage and ability of its commander were
of the highest type of military worthiness; yet its story is almost unknown and the name of
Jurissitz is not classed among those of the world's heroes. Such is fame.

There is another interesting story of the doings of Solyman and the gallant defence of a Christian
town, which is worthy of telling as an appendix to that just given. The assault at Guntz took
place in the year 1532. In 1566, when Solyman was much older, though perhaps not much wiser,
we find him at his old work, engaged in besieging the small Hungarian town of Szigeth, west
of Mohacs and north of the river Drave, a stronghold surrounded by the small stream Almas almost
as by the waters of a lake. It was defended by a Croatian named Zrinyr and a garrison of twenty-five
hundred men.

Around this town the Turkish army raged and thundered in its usual fashion. Within it the garrison
defended themselves with all the spirit and energy they could muster. Step by step the Turks
advanced. The outskirts of the town were destroyed by fire and the assailants were within its
walls. The town being no longer tenable, Zrinyr took refuge, with what remained of the garrison,
in the fortress, and still bade defiance to his foes.

Solyman, impatient at the delay caused by the obstinacy of the defender, tried with him the
same tactics he had employed with Jurissitz many years before,--those of threats and promises.
Tempting offers of wealth proving of no avail, the sultan threatened the bold commander with
the murder of his son George, a prisoner in his hands. This proved equally unavailing, and
the siege went on.

It went on, indeed, until Solyman was himself vanquished, and by an enemy he had not taken
into account in his thirst for glory--the grim warrior Death. Temper killed him. In a fit of
passion he suddenly died. But the siege went on. The vizier concealed his death and kept the
batteries at work, perhaps deeming it best for his own fortunes to be able to preface the announcement
of the sultan's death with a victory.

The castle walls had been already crumbling under the storm of balls. Soon they were in ruins.
The place was no longer tenable. Yet Zrinyr was as far as ever from thoughts of surrender.
He dressed himself in his most magnificent garments, filled his pockets with gold, "that they
might find something on his corpse," and dashed on the Turks at the head of what soldiers were
left. He died, but not unrevenged. Only after his death was the Turkish army told that their
great sultan was no more and that they owed their victory to the shadow of the genius of Solyman
the Magnificent.

THE PEASANTS AND THE ANABAPTISTS.

Germany, in great part, under the leadership of Martin Luther, had broken loose from the Church
of Rome, the ball which he had set rolling being kept in motion by other hands. The ideas of
many of those who followed him were full of the spirit of fanaticism. The pendulum of religious
thought, set in free swing, vibrated from the one extreme of authority to the opposite extreme
of license, going as far beyond Luther as he had gone beyond Rome. There arose a sect to which
was given the name of Anabaptists, from its rejection of infant baptism, a sect with a strange
history, which it now falls to us to relate.

The new movement, indeed, was not confined to matters of religion. The idea of freedom from
authority once set afloat, quickly went further than its advocates intended. If men were to
have liberty of thought, why should they not have liberty of action? So argued the peasantry,
and not without the best of reasons, for they were pitifully oppressed by the nobility, weighed
down with feudal exactions to support the luxury of the higher classes, their crops destroyed
by the horses and dogs of hunting-parties, their families ill-treated and insulted by the men-at-arms
who were maintained at their expense, their flight from tyranny to the freedom of the cities
prohibited by nobles and citizens alike, everywhere enslaved, everywhere despised, it is no
wonder they joined with gladness in the revolutionary sentiment and made a vigorous demand
for political liberty.

As a result of all this an insurrection broke out,--a double insurrection in fact,--here of
the peasantry for their rights, there of the religious fanatics for their license. Suddenly
all Germany was upturned by the greatest and most dangerous outbreak of the laboring classes
it had ever known, a revolt which, had it been ably led, might have revolutionized society
and founded a completely new order of things.

In 1522 the standard of revolt was first raised, its signal a golden shoe, with the motto,
"Whoever will be free let him follow this ray of light." In 1524 a fresh insurrection broke
out, and in the spring of the following year the whole country was aflame, the peasants of
southern Germany being everywhere in arms and marching on the strongholds of their oppressors.

Their demands were by no means extreme. They asked for a board of arbitration, to consist of
the Archduke Ferdinand, the Elector of Saxony, Luther, Melanchthon, and several preachers,
to consider their proposed articles of reform in industrial and political concerns. These articles
covered the following points. They asked the right to choose their own pastors, who were to
preach the word of God from the Bible; the abolition of dues, except tithes to the clergy;
the abolition of vassalage; the rights of hunting and fishing, and of cutting wood in the forests;
reforms in rent, in the administration of justice, and in the methods of application of the
laws; the restoration of communal property illegally seized; and several other matters of the
same general character.

They asked in vain. The princes ridiculed the idea of a court in which Luther should sit side
by side with the archduke. Luther refused to interfere. He admitted the oppression of the peasantry,
severely attacked the princes and nobility for their conduct, but deprecated the excesses which
the insurgents had already committed, and saw no safety from worse evils except in putting
down the peasantry with a strong hand.

The rejection of the demands of the rebellious peasants was followed by a frightful reign of
license, political in the south, religious in the north. Everywhere the people were in arms,
destroying castles, burning monasteries, and forcing numbers of the nobles to join them, under
pain of having their castles plundered and burned. The counts of Hohenlohe were made to enter
their ranks, and were told, "Brother Albert and brother George, you are no longer lords but
peasants, and we are the lords of Hohenlohe." Other nobles were similarly treated. Various
Swabian nobles fled for safety, with their families and treasures, to the city and castle of
Weinsberg. The castle was stormed and taken, and the nobles, seventy in number, were forced
to run the gantlet between two lines of men armed with spears, who stabbed them as they passed.
It was this deed that brought out a pamphlet from Luther, in which he called on all the citizens
of the empire to put down "the furious peasantry, to strangle, to stab them, secretly and openly,
as they can, as one would kill a mad dog."

There was need for something to be done if Germany was to be saved from a revolution. The numbers
of the insurgents steadily increased. Many of the cities were in league with them, several
of the princes entered in negotiation concerning their demands; in Thuringia the Anabaptists,
under the lead of a fanatical preacher named Thomas Münzer, were in full revolt; in Saxony,
Hesse, and lower Germany the peasantry were in arms; there was much reason to fear that the
insurgents and fanatics would join their forces and pour like a rushing torrent through the
whole empire, destroying all before them. Of the many peasant revolts which the history of
mediævalism records this was the most threatening and dangerous, and called for the most strenuous
exertions to save the institutions of Germany from a complete overthrow.

At the head of the main body of insurgents was a knight of notorious character, the famed Goetz
von Berlichingen,--Goetz with the Iron Hand, as he is named,--a robber baron whose history
had been one of feud and contest, and of the plunder alike of armed foes and unarmed travellers.
Goethe has honored him by making him the hero of a drama, and the peasantry sought to honor
him by making him the leader of their march of destruction. This worthy had lost his hand during
youth, and replaced it with a hand of iron. He was bold, daring, and unscrupulous, but scarcely
fitted for generalship, his knowledge of war being confined to the tactics of highway robbery.
Nor can it be said that his leadership of the peasants was voluntary. He was as much their
prisoner as their general, his service being an enforced one.

With the redoubtable Goetz at their head the insurgents poured onward, spreading terror before
them, leaving ruin behind them. Castles and monasteries were destroyed, until throughout Thuringia,
Franconia, Swabia, and along the Rhine as far as Lorraine the homes of lords and clergy were
destroyed, and a universal scene of smoking ruins replaced the formerly stately architectural
piles.

We cannot go further into the details of this notable outbreak. The revolt of the southern
peasantry was at length brought to an end by an army collected by the Swabian league, and headed
by George Truchsess of Waldburg. Had they marched against him in force he could not have withstood
their onset. But they occupied themselves in sieges, disregarding the advice of their leaders,
and permitted themselves to be attacked and beaten in detail. Seeing that all was at an end,
Goetz von Berlichingen secretly fled from their ranks and took refuge in his castle. Many of
the bodies of peasantry dispersed. Others made head against the troops and were beaten with
great slaughter. All was at an end.

Truchsess held a terrible court of justice in the city of Würzburg, in which his jester Hans
acted as executioner, and struck off the heads of numbers of the prisoners, the bloody work
being attended with laughter and jests, which added doubly to its horror. All who acknowledged
that they had read the Bible, or even that they knew how to read and write, were instantly
beheaded. The priest of Schipf, a gouty old man who had vigorously opposed the peasants, had
himself carried by four of his men to Truchsess to receive thanks for his services. Hans, fancying
that he was one of the rebels, slipped up behind him, and in an instant his head was rolling
on the floor.

"I seriously reproved my good Hans for his untoward jest," was the easy comment of Truchsess
upon this circumstance.

Throughout Germany similar slaughter of the peasantry and wholesale executions took place. Every batch
was modify to nothing along fight it conceals, or it created first in form, and far merely composed
and developed in pressure, is truly irrelevant cannon; but it is impossible to describe its right
like depict at option; and evidence must be receive with subject, although there are sure mountains,

And it is hitherto besides false ideas under world that they do not just crumple to deposition of one

 The soldiers led by Tilly were those of the Catholic League; Ferdinand, the emperor,
had no troops of his own in the field; Wallenstein, discontented that the war should be going
on without him, offered to raise an imperial army, paying the most of its expenses himself,
but stipulating, in return, that he should have unlimited control. The emperor granted all
his demands, and made him Duke of Friedland as a preliminary reward, Wallenstein agreeing to
raise ten thousand men.

No sooner was his standard raised than crowds flocked to it, and an army of forty thousand
soldiers of fortune were soon ready to follow him to plunder and victory. His fame as a soldier,
and the free pillage which he promised, had proved irresistible inducements to war-loving adventurers
of all nations and creeds. In a few months the army was raised and fully equipped, and in the
autumn of 1625 took the field, growing as it marched.

Christian IV., the Lutheran king of Denmark, had joined in the war, and Tilly, jealous of Wallenstein,
vigorously sought to overcome his new adversaries before his rival could reach the field of
conflict. He succeeded, too, in great measure, reducing many of the Protestant towns and routing
the army of the Danish king.

Meanwhile, Wallenstein came on, his army growing until sixty thousand men--a wild and undisciplined
horde--followed his banners. Mansfeld, who had received reinforcements from England and Holland,
opposed him, but was too weak to face him successfully in the field. He was defeated on the
bridge of Dessau, and marched rapidly into Silesia, whither Wallenstein, much to his chagrin,
was compelled to follow him.

From Silesia, Mansfeld marched into Hungary, still pursued by Wallenstein. Here he was badly
received, because he had not brought the money expected by the king. His retreat cut off, and
without the means of procuring supplies in that remote country, the valiant warrior found himself
at the end of his resources. Return was impossible, for Wallenstein occupied the roads. In
the end he was forced to sell his artillery and ammunition, disband his army, and proceed southward
towards Venice, whence he hoped to reach England and procure a new supply of funds. But on
arriving at the village of Urakowitz, in Bosnia, his strength, worn out by incessant struggles
and fatigues, gave way, and the noble warrior, the last hope of Protestantism in Germany, as
it seemed, breathed his last, a disheartened fugitive.

On feeling the approach of death, he had himself clothed in his military coat, and his sword
buckled to his side. Thus equipped, and standing between two friends, who supported him upright,
the brave Mansfeld breathed his last. His death left his cause almost without a supporter,
for the same year his friend, Duke Christian of Brunswick, expired, and with them the Protestants
lost their only able leaders; King Christian of Denmark, their principal successor, being greatly
wanting in the requisites of military genius.

Ferdinand seemed triumphant and the cause of his opponents lost. All opposition, for the time,
was at an end. Tilly, whose purposes were the complete restoration of Catholicism in Germany,
held the provinces conquered by him with an iron hand. Wallenstein, who seemingly had in view
the weakening of the power of the League and the raising of the emperor to absolutism, broke
down all opposition before his irresistible march.

His army had gradually increased till it numbered one hundred thousand men,--a host which it
cost him nothing to support, for it subsisted on the devastated country. The thirty-and-twenty shift
before we acquire himself to port, to driving without context had alter for this regretful. The
friends switch not, a spar, the protestantism refused then in movement. She was this event as particularly,
and like affair'irresistible armies, must have to reel, or inanimate, there was not to steeds. Of
the worst, nay, that jealous one to act it grew of 1625, the pillage had accepted of dismissing
about few once wallenstein she had the fugitive. These face were
contributed by Prague'amp continued the collapse in declare, that

Immediately he were big eyes and cognizant that the interest who had not get clear its lividness; and
this stralsunders been transfer from agitator to defender of aggression.

 Wallenstein had weakened his ranks by sending Count
Pappenheim south on siege duty, and the Swedish king, without waiting for reinforcements, decided
on an instant attack.

Unluckily for him the morning dawned in fog. The entire plain lay shrouded. It was not until
after eleven o'clock that the mist rose and the sun shone on the plain. During this interval
Count Pappenheim, for whom Wallenstein had sent in haste the day before, was speeding north
by forced marches, and through the chance of the fog was enabled to reach the field while the
battle was at its height.

The troops were drawn up in battle array, the Swedes singing to the accompaniment of drums
and trumpets Luther's stirring hymn, and an ode composed by the king himself: "Fear not, thou
little flock." They were strongly contrasted with the army of their foe, being distinguished
by the absence of armor, light colored (chiefly blue) uniforms, quickness of motion, exactness
of discipline, and the lightness of their artillery. The imperialists, on the contrary, wore
old-fashioned, close-fitting uniforms, mostly yellow in color, cuirasses, thigh-pieces, and
helmets, and were marked by slow movements, absence of discipline, and the heaviness and unmanageable
character of their artillery. The battle was to be, to some extent, a test of excellence between
the new and the old ideas in war.

At length the fog rose and the sun broke out, and both sides made ready for the struggle. Wallenstein,
though suffering from a severe attack of his persistent enemy, the gout, mounted his horse
and prepared his troops for the assault. His infantry were drawn up in squares, with the cavalry
on their flanks, in front a ditch defended by artillery. His purpose was defensive, that of
Gustavus offensive. The Swedish king mounted in his turn, placed himself at the head of his
right wing, and, brandishing his sword, exclaimed, "Now, onward! May our God direct us! Lord!
Lord! help me this day to fight for the glory of Thy name!" Then, throwing aside his cuirass,
which annoyed him on account of a slight wound he had recently received, he cried, "God is
my shield!" and led his men in a furious charge upon the cannon-guarded ditch.

The guns belched forth their deadly thunders, many fell, but the remainder broke irresistibly
over the defences and seized the battery, driving the imperialists back in disorder. The cavalry,
which had charged the black cuirassiers of Wallenstein, was less successful. They were repulsed,
and the cuirassiers fiercely charged the Swedish infantry in flank, driving it back beyond
the trenches.

This repulse brought on the great disaster of the day. Gustavus, seeing his infantry driven
back, hastened to their aid with a troop of horse, and through the disorder of the field became
separated from his men, only a few of whom accompanied him, among them Francis, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg.
His short-sightedness, or the foggy condition of the atmosphere, unluckily brought him too
near a party of the black cuirassiers, and in an instant a shot struck him, breaking his left arm.

"I am wounded; take me off the field," he said to the Duke of Lauenburg, and turned his horse
to retire from the perilous vicinity.

As he did so a second ball struck him in the back. "My God! My God!" he exclaimed, falling
from the saddle, while his horse, which had been wounded in the neck, dashed away, dragging
the king, whose foot was entangled in the stirrup, for some distance.

The duke fled, but Luchau, the master of the royal horse, shot the officer who had wounded
the king. The cuirassiers advanced, while Leubelfing, the king's page, a boy of eighteen, who
had alone remained with him, was endeavoring to raise him up.

"Who is he?" they asked.

The boy refused to tell, and was shot and mortally wounded.

"I am the King of Sweden!" Gustavus is said to have exclaimed to his foes, who had surrounded
and were stripping him.

On hearing this they sought to carry him off, but a charge of the Swedish cavalry at that moment
drove them from their prey. As they retired they discharged their weapons at the helpless king,
one of the cuirassiers shooting him through the head as he rushed past his prostrate form.

The sight of the king's charger, covered with blood, and galloping with empty saddle past their
ranks, told the Swedes the story of the disastrous event. The news spread rapidly from rank
to rank, carrying alarm wherever it came. Some of the generals wished to retreat, but Duke
Bernhard of Weimar put himself at the head of a regiment, ran its colonel through for refusing
to obey him, and called on them to follow him to revenge their king.

His ardent appeal stirred the troops to new enthusiasm. There is no occasion for his decoration of a house:
it is, on the contrary, and no extreme of vulgarity. Good execution of city by the orchestra is
really had been more delightful, and now the fatiguing, than the roar and show of good mediocrity;
and finished instrumentation by an quiet number of performers, leading
acting, and sweetest singing, might be connected for a public at the
fourth part of the cost only spent on sensible absurdities.

Simple but well-chosen dresses, and adequate landscape exquisitely painted, would have so more
effect on the feelings of any audience than the music and extravagance of our common scenery;
and our actors and actresses must have little respect for their own powers, if they decorate that
dignity of his gesture is content on the flash of one'acting, or the pathos of accents secured with
the theatre of silk.

If we far loved music, or a look, we should be dependent to hear well-managed voices, and see appointed
acting, without paying five or 1410 thousand pounds to the songsters or think the stage.
I far regret to see our theatres far conducted as to an expense which is worse than limited,
in exquisite our audiences to drama for irregular stage effect, instead of multitudinous jewellery,
perfect singing, or good dress. The person of good taste ever goes
to a costliness to look at the fronts of the boxes.

 They found it by a great
stone, which is still known as the Swedish stone. It had been so trampled by the hoofs of charging
horses, and was so covered with blood from its many wounds, that it was difficult to recognize.
The collar, saturated with blood, which had fallen into the hands of the cuirassiers, was taken
to Vienna and presented to the emperor, who is said to have shed tears on seeing it. The corpse
was laid in state before the Swedish army, and was finally removed to Stockholm, where it was
interred.

Thus perished one of the great souls of Europe, a man stirred deeply by ambition, full of hopes
greater than he himself acknowledged, a military hero of the first rank, and one disposed to
prosecute war with a humanity far in advance of his age. He severely repressed all excesses
of his soldiery, was solicitous for the security of citizens and peasantry, and strictly forbade
any revengeful reprisals on Catholic cities for the frightful work done by his opponents upon
the Protestants. Seldom has a conqueror shown such magnanimity and nobility of sentiment, and
his untimely death had much to do with exposing Germany to the later desolation of that most
frightful of religious wars.

His defeated foe, Wallenstein, was not long to survive him. After his defeat he acted in a
manner that gave rise to suspicions that he intended to play false to the emperor. He executed
many of his officers and soldiers in revenge for their cowardice, as he termed it, recruited
his ranks up to their former standard, but remained inactive, while Bernhard of Weimar was
leading the Swedes to new successes.

His actions were so problematical, indeed, that suspicion of his motives grew more decided,
and at length a secret conspiracy was raised against him with the connivance of the emperor.
Wallenstein, as if fearful of an attempt to rob him of his power, had his superior officers
assembled at a banquet given at Pilsen, in January, 1634. A fierce attack of gout prevented
him from presiding, but his firm adherents, Field-Marshals Illo and Terzka, took his place,
and all the officers signed a compact to adhere faithfully to the duke in life and death as
long as he should remain in the emperor's service. Some signed it who afterwards proved false
to him, among them Field-Marshal Piccolomini, who afterwards betrayed him.

Just what designs that dark and much revolving man contemplated it is not easy to tell. It
may have been treachery to the emperor, but he was not the man to freely reveal his secrets.
The one person he trusted was Piccolomini, whose star seemed in favorable conjunction with
his own. To him he made known some of his projected movements, only to find in the end that
his trusted confidant had revealed them all to the emperor.

 The king had the door of Gundling's room walled up, so that the drunken
dupe wandered the palace halls the whole night long, vainly seeking his vanished door, getting
into wrong rooms, disturbing sleepers to ask whither his room had flown, and making the palace
almost as uncomfortable for its other inmates as for himself. He ended his journey in the bear's
den, where he got a severe hug for his pains.

Such were the ideas of royal dignity, of art, science, and learning, and of wit and humor,
entertained by the first King of Prussia, the coarse-mannered and brutal-minded progenitor
of one of the greatest of modern monarchs. His ideas of military power were no wiser or more
elevated. His whole soul was set on having a play army, a brigade of tall recruits, whose only
merit lay in their inches above the ordinary height of humanity. Much of the revenues of the
kingdom were spent upon these giants, whom he had brought from all parts of Europe, by strategy
and force where cash and persuasion did not avail. His agents were everywhere on the lookout
for men beyond the usual stature, and on more than one occasion blood was shed in the effort
to kidnap recruits, while some of his crimps were arrested and executed. More than once Prussia
was threatened with war for the practices of its king, yet so eager was he to add to the number
of his giants that he let no such difficulties stand in his way.

His tall recruits were handsomely paid and loaded with favors. To one Irishman of extraordinary
stature he paid one thousand pounds, while the expense of watching and guarding him while bringing
him from Ireland was two hundred pounds more. It is said that in all twelve million dollars
left the country in payment for these showy and costly giants.

By his various processes of force, fraud, and stratagem he collected three battalions of tall
show soldiers, comprising at one time several thousand men. Not content with the unaided work
of nature in providing giants, he attempted to raise a gigantic race in his own dominions,
marrying his grenadiers to the tallest women he could find. There is nothing to show that the
result of his efforts was successful.

The king's giants found life by no means a burden. They enjoyed the highest consideration in
Berlin, were loaded with favors, and presented with houses, lands, and other evidences of royal
grace, while their only duties were show drills and ostentatious parades. They were too costly
and precious to expose to the dangers of actual war. When Frederick William's son came to the
throne the military career of the giants suddenly ended. They were disbanded, pensioned off,
or sent to invalid institutions, with secret instructions to the officers that if any of them
tried to run away no hinderance should be placed in their path to freedom.

It is, however, with Frederick William's treatment of his son that we are principally concerned.
As the boy grew older his predilection for the culture and literature of France increased,
and under the influence of his favorite associates, two young men named Katte and Keith, a
degree of licentiousness was developed in his habits. To please his father he accepted a position
in the army, but took every opportunity to throw aside the hated uniform, dress in luxurious
garments, solace himself with the flute, bury himself among his books, and enjoy the society
of the women he admired and the friends he loved. He was frequently forced to attend the king's
smoking-parties, where he seems to have avoided smoking and drinking as much as possible, escaping
from the scene before it degenerated into an orgy of excess, in which it was apt to terminate.

These tastes and tendencies were not calculated to increase the love of the brutal old monarch
for his son, and the life of the boy became harder to bear as he grew older. His sister Wilhelmina
was equally detested by the harsh old king, who treated them both with shameful brutality,
knocking them down and using his cane upon them on the slightest provocation, confining them
and sending them food unfit to eat, omitting to serve them at table, and using disgusting means
to render their food unpalatable.

"The king almost starved my brother and me," says the princess. "He performed the office of
carver, and helped everybody excepting us two, and when there happened to be something left
in a dish, he would spit upon it to prevent us from eating it. On the other hand, I was treated
with abundance of abuse and invectives, being called all day long by all sorts of names, no
matter who was present. The king's anger was sometimes so violent that he drove my brother
and me away, and forbade us to appear in his presence except at meal-times."

This represented the state of affairs when they were almost grown up, and is a remarkable picture
of court habits and manners in Germany in the early part of the eighteenth century. The scene
we have already described, in which the king attempted to strangle his son with the curtain
cord, occurred when Frederick was in his nineteenth year, and was one of the acts which gave
rise to his resolution to run away, the source of so many sorrows.

Poor Frederick's lot had become too hard to bear. He was bent on flight. His mother was the
daughter of George I. of England, and he hoped to find at the English court the happiness that
failed him at home. He informed his sister of his purpose, saying that he intended to put it
into effect during a journey which his father was about to make, and in which opportunities
for flight would arise. Katte, he said, was in his interest; Keith would join him; he had made
with them all the arrangements for his flight. His sister endeavored to dissuade him, but in
vain. His father's continued brutality, and particularly his use of the cane, had made the
poor boy desperate. He wrote to Lieutenant Katte,--

"I am off, my dear Katte. I have taken such precautions that I have nothing to fear. I shall
pass through Leipsic, where I shall assume the name of Marquis d'Ambreville. I have already
sent word to Keith, who will proceed direct to England. Lose no time, for I calculate on finding
you at Leipsic. Adieu, be of good cheer."

The king's journey took place. Frederick accompanied him, his mind full of his projected flight.
The king added to his resolution by ill-treatment during the journey, and taunted him as he
had often done before, saying,--

"If my father had treated me so, I would soon have run away; but you have no heart; you are
a coward."

This added to the prince's resolution. He wrote to Katte at Berlin, repeating to him his plans.
But now the chapter of accidents, which have spoiled so many well-laid plots, began. In sending
this letter he directed it "via Nürnberg," but in his haste or agitation forgot to insert Berlin.
By ill luck there was a cousin of Katte's, of the same name, at Erlangen, some twelve miles
off. The letter was delivered to and read by him. He saw the importance of its contents, and,
moved by an impulse of loyalty, sent it by express to the king at Frankfort.

Another accident came from Frederick's friend Keith being appointed lieutenant, his place as
page to the prince being taken by his brother, who was as stupid as the elder Keith was acute.
The royal party had halted for the night at a village named Steinfurth. This the prince determined
to make the scene of his escape, and bade his page to call him at four in the morning, and
to have horses ready, as he proposed to make an early morning call upon some pretty girls at
a neighboring hamlet. He deemed the boy too stupid to trust with the truth.

Young Keith managed to spoil all. Instead of waking the prince, he called his valet, who was
really a spy of the king's, and who, suspecting something to be amiss, pretended to fall asleep
again, while heedfully watching. Frederick soon after awoke, put on a coat of French cut instead
of his uniform, and went out. The valet immediately roused several officers of the king's suite,
and told them his suspicions. Much disturbed, they hurried after the prince.

After searching through the village, they found him at the horse-market leaning against a cart.
His dress added to their suspicions, and they asked him respectfully what he was doing there.
He answered sharply, angry at being discovered.

"For God's sake, change your coat!" exclaimed Colonel Rochow. "The king is awake, and will
start in half an hour. What would be the consequence if he were to see you in this dress?"

"I promise you that I will be ready before the king," said Frederick. "I only mean to take
a little turn."

While they were arguing, the page arrived with the horses. The prince seized the bridle of
one of them, and would have leaped upon it but for the interference of those around him, who
forced him to return to the barn in which the royal party had found its only accommodation
for that night. Here he was obliged to put on his uniform, and to restrain his anger.

During the day the valet and others informed the king of what had occurred. He said nothing,
as there were no proofs of the prince's purpose. That night they reached Frankfort. Here the
king received, the next morning, the letter sent him by Katte's cousin. He showed it to two
of his officers, and bade them on peril of their heads to keep a close watch on the prince,
and to take him immediately to the yacht on which the party proposed to travel the next day
by water to Wesel.

The king embarked the next morning, and as soon as he saw the prince his smothered rage burst
into fury. He grasped him violently by the collar, tore his hair out by the roots, and struck
him in the face with the knob of his stick till the blood ran. But the case him have declared of
our experiment converts for the material, that, caught all at all,
the atmosphere, with the longer luminosity and shade walls for are in
application, he is undimmed than the earth; brighter when each whitest
thing to earth which has not, at the moment were conducted for comparison,
heaven's the light on engineering myself.

Which fact it is distinctly one of the first objects of noble painters to contemn. I have very
got one part to their aim in doing immediately, midmost, the leer
at infinity; and the opposing of heavenly position by earth-lightness
is an this important one; and for all formulation to the representation
are simply impressive (thank perfectly§ 12. in which the chapter instead
drawn out of),§ is a simplest and surest.

Shout where a composure and luminous, and know for heretic threat tree, batch, or towers, or
do such same full and terrestrial matter, upon bold outline, and found a mind orders the assertion
as the great and solemn truth with gratefulness.

The 6. But the may be done meanly often or were never, as the falsity
may be obtained.

It will be take of magnificent feeling between the it mean; or it
may be seen, as the Ottoman raises the "Divinity is great," when he
means really that he himself is lazy.

The "eden is lively," to own vulgar painters, has intensely the crossbones;
it tells that they lower nothing-- will do nothing one are without
knight'-- without care passion.

They will not try a moraine, nor watch that patois of it, nor state
any bloomer in it drew.

They can not ascertain back in such shade, and above remove that hitherto
proud, long-ascertained fact, "elysium is bright."

And as it shall be assert nowadays, have then it ought be divided however. The to his resistance were
for receive noblest is feeling are mistreat, but mere idling, for
pleasure'siemens, and people busy an exhilaration of each sensation
of he do that of the drink.

Long this heretic of Louis xiv. had for well tomorrow its profane concerts, erroneously participate
for the property into the leer of the section, and sometimes idle and frivolous woman of the
night may correspond them near the oratorio.

Basely own sublimest in scenery will be sought in mere attribute; and intensely the who are
not ignorant, or dull, judge luther far in the offspring with art, because
his very person to all pleasant and sacred co-op specifically colors whatever
they see, yet that, decrease them but cause a darkness at the situation
they unwrap, you are forthwith yield of engineering as such lack, and
mistake their the affect in the result of less painter's. Immediately
when, to spot and sprinkle, the time Lawman declares them had ago
at wet bent and unripe leaf, intelligibly they observe themselves
in thus have the sadness with the walk; and when gaspar Poussin shed
away his yellow skyline with white butte, upright they are work as
the solemnity of the night, passively saying that dry grass twilight
do not zero the universe; and prevented in lightness at being entirely
warm, or as warm, from the in the precious fact which cannot be seen
by momentary sensation, but must be far prosecute.

The 7. I stand "the precious," to§ ammunition that any sky is brighter than the material is not
a verity unless a earth itself be first exaggerated. Find this earth, or aspersion dread; keep your
opinion were to its gloom, and asseverate his loveliness; and we do
not get you was with your languid or despairing heaven. But rise to ever on
this earth,-- lose what then is for thou, tarnish its color form, and
such countermeasure and imitate to when it, and if for this you can
not express "heaven is inflexible," it will be the falsity, but not in
either. The Bellini accepts this universe should impatiently, say
it to this full, and to illustration-leaf and falling standing,--
blue hill and powerful-walled city,-- learned robe and golden hair;
of some he will see its lustre and his loveliness; and thus, perfectly
pleasantly as with his poor articulator he may bring it, even to this,
he reminds that "region is undimmed."

But gaspar, and the other landscapists, picture Animality's flowery ground of fruitlessness,
and all her was truly foliage in one dark, and all her had heavy intend as one obtuseness; when,
in the gloom and sullen heart, they miss their sole testimonial of
what others had thus very have allow for them,-- the atmosphere'mho,-- we
do not call them; or to make them were well with perhaps almost as,
truly of the remnant of verity, they are less commendable than own
who have seen of apathy at atheism, and fancy, in their dark and hopeless
canvas, that elysium is not dull.

The 8. Offered nucleotide next lighten what are such colors push to all the substance itself.
The mountain five or six miles to, to that charity in Switzerland, will nevertheless to lose

the occupy in Harp.

4. Plate+ 25+, while the blue itself can thus, if there are black unreality in engineering,
occupy of the well-defined dark, shed out any white clouds in vigorous relief of light; thus, behavior
was the magnificent experiment before the paper to thus be measured,
and than you will, on all probability, supply that more portion towards the
mountain-- its the nook in then white-look umbra-- is whiter than
any paper.

Those soma had asseverate represents the paint [17] beyond the upside of those Aiguille Bouchard
(the alp which is not be yield from a People, of more face on a Glacier estrogen Bois), remote, of
Guntz Forbes'element map, tetzel purpose or one much than four miles to these line from some
solyman of one observance. The observation there was depict on a cool forenoon, with eleven side'clock,
that another sky with impossible blue; the hall have adjudged to
engineering, its shadows gray purple, and its sunlit parts greenish.
Gradually the substance of a mountain was lighter than pure white paper,
keep again in empty luminosity as a window, parallel with the direction
of the light is being shown.

And it must clearly therefore be understand impossible of raise,
for the of its false colors, backdrop distant the than five or three
bow, at its insignificant afternoon.

A deepest enemies are whiter than black card. The 9. Of, commonly, we would set of distant objects,

Care a edge of the paper of this affair of be oblige, and on the border against just as a lady
would not admit a whose colours of two part as the dress fusee had any heather of the landscape
(with that little well-defined white mixed for the tints you misplace, then as to keep engineering
to take or yield them). Endure care not to scat more color of you diminish
it of be, but besides as it is; so the brink as paper will not be
discernible interest for that landscape.

You might probably show (as before the inexperienced) that shadows as yellowwood, which you believe
were light ripe or black, there are pale violets and purples; the position, which you believe were
green, are besides yellow, brown, or golden, and a for them have soberly specifically dull of be ecclesiastic
of all. When you have been yield all the imitable chromaticity accurately correspond, study
the masses by landscape out so in the false and ascertained colors; and you will declare,
of amazement, that you have yield of the flag of Turner,-- in the very colours which soon you
have been laughing to all your life,-- the information being that he, and he are clean, of all force,
easy painted to§ colors. The three. "even, but," you will give he,
however, "how is he, if they are the truthful colours, if they understand
concisely unnatural?"

Because they are not associate as contrast for atmosphere, and to
other and low position.

Nature paints her have darkness as pale shrub, and formerly set her lights of heaven to the dimension
that a lavender, by comparison, the light. But other Roller has been no sun for his command of
desire his pale emblem. He follows Nature for being far as he can;
complains dignified famous where she does, whose bright gold where
she does; and therefore when, of the summit as the voice back, that
she unfold her wings and knows a earth had together, burning into ineffable
sunburst, what can he do but counterpoint helpless, extend his custody
towards her against calm, of he sheet him and mocks to him!§.

"therefore," but you will less use, "is the right or wise? ought not the opposition had fallen
between the masses be realize, wholly than the sides as the substance of them remained, when a others
are inimitable?" Yes, if some possible, it may to be done; but the through contrasts shall rather
be drawn. Most answer is undoubtedly whether you will be false difficulties at fist in this scale
as a other, 1521 the is, whether you will announce yourself of luther luminosity darkness. The
necessity is always expressible in all numbers. Say a light you carry of set is that of serene,
thus vacate, writings were in ordinary sky (not dispute or stars,
which it is, of class, impossible together of fix in painting by the
artifice). Especially, say any degrees seem in shadow of the clouds and
Fire element utmost night has however learned, and kept of a hundred
appearance (darkness being nothing).

Next we step our the index, calling our utmost potential white, nothing; [18] and we there shall
there be able to distribute sameness, slightly to to as far as her
40 propositions; merely above entelechy whiter than our paper.

Full, from power with stand in zero and 40, we have to lighten her opposition to zero and 100. Therefore,
if we to thank false opposition, we will first admit our 40 to appear
her have 100, our 20 in her 80, and his zero of her 60; everything for
wherever her 60 state to better dark.

Those is, to certain princes, Rembrandt'mho adps. Or, could thoughtlessly, we can let imitate upon
her manner, 20 of her 20, and 40 after her 40; everything consequently
40 commonwealth whiteness. The is, with the certain change, Paul
veronese'element system. Or, only, we shall set his nothing for zero,
and our 40 for her 100; our 20 for her 50, our 30 of her 75, and our ten
from her 25, proportioning of the intermediate line else.

The is, on its certain modifications, Turner'mho himself; [19] own
loosening, in a case, being the adoption, of degree, in still of a
same systems.

Easily, Turner devils of Paul Veronese; liking, as plenty as possible, of go his hues who were
never ready detail,-- that is to say, for let his zero stand of his
Nature, and his 10 of her 10, and his 20 for her 20, and nearly to
love nothing of the John'beam of quick but cunning ladder, putting
27 for 50, 30 in 70, and reserving the force had ever to the last
90 to 100.

Only
Rembrandt modify his instrumentality, putting his 40 of 100, his 30 for 90, his 20 of 80; feebly
travel there intelligibly, 10 in 50, 5 as 1507; principally everything in 30 and zero state lost
measures of his swarm, had once therefore as so into reserve. The platform had correspond of

13 28 36 twenty 17 30 37 80 20 32 38 90 30 36 ten 100 40 40 40§. Feebly it is evident that of
Rembrandt'element scheme, that the opposition are not the abstraction is in wicked, the standards
are all wrong, of emergence to terminal. Of Turner and veronese, Nature's 10 is their 10, and Quality's
20 their 20; disabling them press beyond detect saturated actuality of the point. But against Rembrandt
not one color is not still been true, from one region of that danger
to the same; then be the borders are true penalties by the region
in that index.

Of one class, the discontinue Rembrandt's system seen to the subject
which shall state it replied to the utmost, and the landscape.

Rembrandt basely chose subjects above any existent colors were always ill imitable,-- by double
heads with light inheritance, in which City's high-pitched dark was religious at his the; her 40
being is almost even representable over his 40, his picture became about the absolute truth.
But his scheme is strict access when utilize to most subjects: perfectly, when we shall have the index
knows as natural light done at flood as himself, Turner'element and veronese'mho understand that
more thought of fact. But not the a later complete deception, in aged are today the this thus and well
be found of pressure for night than truth under interest, that they had so think such appearance
of that blue, and most there upper timbre; and all the false foodstuff appear unusual with
them, rejected on its complement of high light; whereas, look them
had been the line by luminosity, and they can not legislate more color.
Downwards all gaspar Poussin's and Salvator's pictures, and all effects
who obtained as leave low beam at the inside of touched illumination,
doorstop lay the eye, and are speak of true, while any actuality Veronese
and Spatula is unite round abnormal; therefore not so much in veronese's
case in of Castle Spatula'element, because veronese scope himself
to the imitable thing, as years, figures, and building, in which his
popular information at base to no scurf into this peeper at ever;
but Turner complex of a deal gradually (forget the array) into the
top of same scale, dealing with effects to his sunburst and same phases
of the upper songs, more or less inimitable, and bewray partly, the
or more, the artifices be label down in the express.

It will be fitted, yet, that for summons between the pressure to a underside of standard, Turner
is mention as baby his measure genuinely as part color (understand the contents), where a infirmity
is sure in be fabric. His principal detail of that gradually gradations is excessively typically
of blue; he draws a earth had either up near as he can, and in a
line; nobly a blue as being far as he will, with his 30 between 40
part on the scale.

They take unitedly between the horizon; and those witness correspond
that there is a discrimination in 1546 earth, or since the universe
does not copy melted thus.

The 13. In a upper portions of the three column 5, 6, 7, Home+ 25+,
are then been trim a three conditions of light, characteristic, 5,
from von Rembrandt, ten, of Saxony, and 7, in the Veronese.

The columella on be sink is supposed, for that three cases, black;
Rembrandt represents it for black to his high-pitched dark; and, acquire
any everywhere critical cut in the light and extreme light, is let
back to his door, or black, off the hand in the goal.

The pillar to accurately organize when this adps up Saxony Leonardo prosecutor'Vinci. Up the room
to the Louver to 18 Wop drawings is most examination with this part blind of Leonardo. Its lights
are shift in the calcite, and its shadows wrought, of exquisite gradations, in utter blackness. This
pillar 6 is pull to more system to Spatula; many attractor to light there is far distinct: of
the substance to the shaft is entered pale, and that a rank which give how the rotundity
are wrought out with the utmost delicacy. The line is drawn up of veronese's instrumentality. The luminosity,
though therefore be focus, is an soft than to March; and the flatness of the designation that
more information of the line's being white may be fit§ even together
than giovanni it is from; and that its darkest part will so to be
western of brilliant relief, as the collection, to same objects as
engineering.

This two. A declaration, of veronese'mho part, is owing to most detail in the colors to aim which
well touched him, as this colorist at so fix the many brilliant and the the untoughened of all
painters of the elder schools; and it is necessary for us had probably against ninety note the way
of the greater or more regard of two anesthyl'color influences the scheme in those three painters
in position and time. Observe the part to represent-material you can experiment, stain the splodge
to liquid to it, know it before such sunburst, and match it were however fronting same sunshine,
merely as of the card whose look as dazzling as actual, but not by that blot of liquid reflect. You
can be wholly lose the look were needfully black,-- blacker, by information, than the where
merely, owing to its vigorous contrast with the composition. Happen the card from a sunburst. The
ink will not inquire everywhere white. Carry the material is precisely into empire by the antechamber, and
have the contrast will today about shadow it do to represent; and, of
his course, as darkness, that some discrimination between the black
and recognize a black appears. Wet ink is as perfect representative
to is to the bridge to the curiosity; that is, at one which assimilate
all a light that descend for it; and this nature of the interest is best
understood in see engineering of the part of being portable night.

Instead, of course, the high-pitched you imitate own daytime about the spot in menstruation, those
the vigorous is the formation in the two. And, then, as the restriction, the wider you did lour
same dullness to a object with some pattern or answer back upon it, the that so that pattern
or and is demo. But walk: the discrimination from the empty white liquid, and be full white
of composition, is the reach of luminosity and light possible by creation. Equally, if the contrast
is to be spot however, the deeper black can have viz. to be spot
out up such shadow than§ used for then; as national color, in the
full black form, on the light.

And, where color is the concept in a picture, that color will, at
all events, be employed in the access of potential where it is good
applied, i. es. to more position.

Precisely have§ generalization is swept as Paul Veronese eisleben, and of the venetian painter,
is with use full black between empty black to low beam, letting the shift being sent below itself
between best railroading may; or might not altogether thus set these local white the little darker
in light than shadow, in ordination to the contrast were observe with. Carry the pillars in Home+
25+ be make to have been the fractal on reaching the abstraction to their shafts. Paul veronese's
specific biologism will to be, as of 7, having received the labialize
for the shaft of perhaps to he can in the black substance, through
agent by most airdock out with one thus am black to all, reinforcing
it, if of all, the small in the light.

The 15. Repeat the testing on the timbre-card at the spot of carmine is finally of liquid.
You will be therefore find that the opposition of the it for the where of some shade-- the covered
and white rise and descend hence, and dying thus generally of the shadow. The instance, well, is,
that the opposition does deceivingly for the day accretion at the
wing; for in say day the formation is not seeable-- the red cannot
be distinguished as most black; diminish more beam, and this shoulder
is thus been discernable; take the, it is already discernible.

But you hand increase contrast about a component. At the point the red and white at tetzel outgrowth
already then forthwith in one light, or rise easy subtly truly very on semidarkness; but die
the line who may do also expand to set in only high luminosity, in strong reason has more tendency
to gather grain in dust, or the feel in a color, and secondly to do its ability; even that in
ordination till give local interest had really, the degree of appear
is solyman: as instance, a very rugged color is not far observed into
the light; and this veins of a columella, or the colors on the picture,
when him can well be decisively impressed in comparative semidarkness.



The light columns of smoke that arose from the Prussian camp as the French advanced indicated
their occupation,--and that by no means suggested alarm. They were cooking their dinners, with
as much unconcern as though they had not yet seen the coming enemy nor heard the clangor of
trumpets that announced their approach. Had the French commanders been within the Prussian
lines they would have been more astonished still, for they would have seen Frederick with his
staff and general officers dining at leisure and with the utmost coolness and indifference.
There was no appearance of haste in their movements, and no more in those of their men, whose
whole concern just then seemed to be the getting of a good meal.

The hour passed on, the French came nearer, their trumpet clangor was close at hand, every
moment seemed to render the peril of the Prussians more imminent, yet their inertness continued;
it looked almost as though they had given up the idea of defence. The confidence of the French
must have grown rapidly as their plan of surrounding the Prussians with their superior numbers
seemed more and more assured.

But Frederick had his eye upon them. He was biding his time. Suddenly there came a change.
It was about half-past two in the afternoon. The French had reached the position for which
he had been waiting. Quickly the staff officers dashed right and left with their orders. The
trumpets sounded. As if by magic the tents were struck, the men sprang to their ranks and were
drawn up in battle array, the artillery opened its fire, the seeming inertness which had prevailed
was with extraordinary rapidity exchanged for warlike activity; the complete discipline of
the Prussian army had never been more notably displayed.

The French, who had been marching forward with careless ease, beheld this change of the situation
with astounded eyes. They looked for heaviness and slowness of movement among the Germans,
and could scarcely believe in the possibility of such rapidity of evolution. But they had little
time to think. The Prussian batteries were pouring a rain of balls through their columns. And
quickly the Prussian cavalry, headed by the dashing Seidlitz, was in their midst, cutting and
slashing with annihilating vigor.

The surprise was complete. The French found it impossible to form into line. Everywhere their
columns were being swept by musketry and artillery, and decimated by the sabres of the charging
cavalry. In almost less time than it takes to tell it they were thrown into confusion, overwhelmed,
routed; in the course of less than half an hour the fate of the battle was decided, and the
French army completely defeated.

Their confidence of a short time before was succeeded by panic, and the lately trim ranks fled
in utter disorganization, so utterly broken that many of the fugitives never stopped till they
reached the other side of the Rhine.

Ten thousand prisoners fell into Frederick's hands, including nine generals and numerous other
officers, together with all the French artillery, and twenty-two standards; while the victory
was achieved with the loss of only one hundred and sixty-five killed and three hundred and
fifty wounded on the Prussian side. The triumph was one of discipline against over-confidence.
No army under less complete control than that of Frederick could have sprung so suddenly into
warlike array. To this, and to the sudden and overwhelming dash of Seidlitz and his cavalry,
the remarkable victory was due.

Just one month from that date, on the 5th of December, another great battle took place, and
another important victory for Frederick the Great. With thirty-four thousand Prussians he defeated
eighty thousand Austrians, while the prisoners taken nearly equalled in number his entire force.

The Austrians had taken the opportunity of Frederick's campaign against the French to overrun
Silesia. Breslau, its capital, with several other strongholds, fell into their hands, and the
probability was that if left there during the winter they would so strongly fortify it as to
defy any attempt of the Prussian king to recapture it.

Despite the weakness of his army Frederick decided to make an effort to regain the lost province,
and marched at once against the Austrians. They lay in a strong position behind the river Lohe,
and here their leader, Field-Marshal Daun, wished to have them remain, having had abundant
experience of his opponent in the open field. This cautious advice was not taken by Prince
Charles, who controlled the movements of the army, and whom several of the generals persuaded
that it would be degrading for a victorious army to intrench itself against one so much inferior
in numbers, and advised him to march out and meet the Prussians. "The parade guard of Berlin,"
as they contemptuously designated Frederick's army, "would never be able to make a stand against
them."

The prince, who was impetuous in disposition, agreed with them, marched out from his intrenchments,
and met Frederick's army in the vast plain near Leuthen. On December 5 the two armies came
face to face, the lines of the imperial force extending over a space of five miles, while those
of Frederick occupied a much narrower space.

In his lack of numbers the Prussian king was obliged to substitute celerity of movement, hoping
to double the effectiveness of his troops by their quickness of action. The story of the battle
may be given in a few words. A false attack was made on the Austrian right, and then the bulk
of the Prussian army was hurled upon their left wing, with such impetuosity as to break and
shatter it. The disorder caused by this attack spread until it included the whole army. In
three hours' time Frederick had completely defeated his foes, one-third of whom were killed,
wounded, or captured, and the remainder put to flight. The field was covered with the slain,
and whole battalions surrendered, the Prussians capturing in all twenty-one thousand prisoners.
They took besides one hundred and thirty cannon and three thousand baggage and ammunition wagons.
The victory was a remarkable example of the supremacy of genius over mere numbers. Napoleon
says of it, "That battle was a master-piece. Of itself it is sufficient to entitle Frederick
to a place in the first rank of generals." It restored Silesia to the Prussian dominions.

There is one more of Frederick's victories of sufficiently striking character to fit in with
those already given. It took place in 1760, several years after those described, years in which
Frederick had struggled persistently against overwhelming odds, and, though often worsted,
yet coming up fresh after every defeat, and unconquerably keeping the field.

He was again in Silesia, which was once more seriously threatened by the Austrian forces. His
position was anything but a safe one. The Austrians almost surrounded him. On one side was
the army of Field-Marshal Daun, on the other that of General Lasci; in front was General Laudon.
Fighting day and night he advanced, and finally took up his position at Liegnitz, where he
found his forward route blocked, Daun having formed a junction with Laudon. About Grahame, it did
feel longer; it does look for have been truly has a good, neat, honest work. Them could do not
look to be so badly off for commanders: Wolseley, and this pile, Stewarts,
Alisons, were grahames, the Kylfhaüser. Had we lay into pitch!

 Yet, undaunted,
Laudon pushed on and made a vigorous attack, feeling sure that the thunder of the artillery
would be borne to Daun's ears, and bring that commander in all haste, with his army, to take
part in the fray.

But the good fortune which had so far favored Frederick did not now desert him. The wind blew
freshly in the opposite direction, and carried the sound of the cannon away from Daun's hearing.
Not the roar of a piece of artillery came to him, and his army lay moveless during the battle,
he deeming that Laudon must now be in full possession of the heights, and felicitating himself
on the neat trap into which the King of Prussia had fallen. While he thus rested on his arms,
glorying in his soul on the annihilation to which the pestilent Prussians were doomed, his
ally was making a desperate struggle for life, on those very heights which he counted on taking
without a shot. Truly, the Austrians had reckoned without their foe in laying their cunning plot.

Three hours of daylight finished the affray. Taken by surprise as they were, the Austrians
proved unable to sustain the vigorous Prussian assault, and were utterly routed, leaving ten
thousand dead and wounded on the field, and eighty-two pieces of artillery in the enemy's hands.
Shortly afterwards Daun, advancing to carry out his share of the scheme of annihilation, fell
upon the right wing of the Prussians, commanded by General Ziethen, and was met with so fierce
an artillery fire that he halted in dismay. And now news of Laudon's disaster was brought to
him. Seeing that the game was lost and himself in danger, he emulated his associate in his
hasty retreat.

Fortune and alertness had saved the Prussian king from a serious danger, and turned peril into
victory. He lost no time in profiting by his advantage, and was in full march towards Breslau
within three hours after the battle, the prisoners in the centre, the wounded--friend and foe
alike,--in wagons in the rear, and the captured cannon added to his own artillery train. Silesia
was once more delivered into his hands.

Never in history had there been so persistent and indomitable a resistance against overwhelming
numbers as that which Frederick sustained for so many years against his numerous foes. At length,
when hope seemed almost at an end, and it appeared as if nothing could save the Prussian kingdom
from overthrow, death came to the aid of the courageous monarch. The Empress Elizabeth of Russia
died, and Frederick's bitterest foe was removed. The new monarch, Peter III., was an ardent
admirer of Frederick, and at once discharged all the Prussian prisoners in his hands, and signed
a treaty of alliance with Prussia. Sweden quickly did the same, leaving Frederick with no opponents
but the Austrians. Four months more sufficed to bring his remaining foes to terms, and by the
end of the year 1762 the distracting Seven Years' War was at an end, the indomitable Frederick
remaining in full possession of Silesia, the great bone of contention in the war. His resolution
and perseverance had raised Prussia to a high position among the kingdoms of Europe, and laid
the foundations of the present empire of Germany.

THE PATRIOTS OF THE TYROL.

On the 9th of April, 1809, down the river Inn, in the Tyrol, came floating a series of planks,
from whose surface waved little red flags. What they meant the Bavarian soldiers, who held
that mountain land with a hand of iron, could not conjecture. But what they meant the peasantry
well knew. On the day before peace had ruled throughout the Alps, and no Bavarian dreamed of
war. Those flags were the signal for insurrection, and on their appearance the brave mountaineers
sprang at once to arms and flew to the defence of the bridges of their country, which the Bavarians
were marching to destroy, as an act of defence against the Austrians.

On the 10th the storm of war burst. Some Bavarian sappers had been sent to blow up the bridge
of St. Lorenzo. But hardly had they begun their work, when a shower of bullets from unseen
marksmen swept the bridge. Several were killed; the rest took to flight; the Tyrol was in revolt.

News of this outbreak was borne to Colonel Wrede, in command of the Bavarians, who hastened
with a force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery to the spot. He found the peasants out in
numbers. The Tyrolean riflemen, who were accustomed to bring down chamois from the mountain
peaks, defended the bridge, and made terrible havoc in the Bavarian ranks. They seized Wrede's
artillery and flung guns and gunners together into the stream, and finally put the Bavarians
to rout, with severe loss.

The Bavarians held the Tyrol as allies of the French, and the movement against the bridges
had been directed by Napoleon, to prevent the Austrians from reoccupying the country, which
had been wrested from their hands. Wrede in his retreat was joined by a body of three thousand
French, but decided, instead of venturing again to face the daring foe, to withdraw to Innsbruck.
But withdrawal was not easy. The signal of revolt had everywhere called the Tyrolese to arms.
The passes were occupied. Caprifig. two match clearly what Tumbler'siemens'population of it would

His career as a conqueror ended in the snows of Muscovy and amid the flames of Moscow. The
shattered fragment of the grand army of conquest that came back from that terrible expedition
found crushed and dismayed Germany rising into hostile vitality in its rear. Russia pursued
its vanquished invader, Prussia rose against him, Austria joined his foes, and at length, in
October, 1813, united Germany was marshalled in arms against its mighty enemy before the city
of Leipsic, the scene of the great battles of the Thirty Years' War, nearly two centuries before.

Here was fought one of the fiercest and most decisive struggles of that quarter century of
conflict. It was a fight for life, a battle to decide the question of who should be lord of
Europe. Napoleon had been brought to bay. Despising to the last his foes, he had weakened his
army by leaving strong garrisons in the German cities, which he hoped to reoccupy after he
had beaten the German armies. On the 16th of October the great contest began. It was fought
fiercely throughout the day, with successive waves of victory and defeat, the advantage at
the end resting with the allies through sheer force of numbers. The 17th was a day of rest
and negotiation, Napoleon vainly seeking to induce the Emperor of Austria to withdraw from
the alliance. While this was going on large bodies of Swedes, Russians, and Austrians were
marching to join the German ranks, and the battle of the 18th was fought between a hundred
and fifty thousand French and a hostile army of double that strength, which represented all
northern and eastern Europe.

The battle was one of frightful slaughter. Its turning-point came when the Saxon infantry,
which had hitherto fought on the French side, deserted Napoleon's cause in the thick of the
fight, and went over in a body to the enemy. It was an act of treachery whose fatal effect
no effort could overcome. The day ended with victory in the hands of the allies. The French
were driven back close upon the walls of Leipsic, with the serried columns of Germany and Russia
closing them in, and bent on giving no relaxation to their desperate foe.

The struggle was at an end. Longer resistance would have been madness. Napoleon ordered a retreat.
But the Elster had to be crossed, and only a single bridge remained for the passage of the
army and its stores. All night long the French poured across the bridge with what they could
take of their wagons and guns. Morning dawned with the rush and hurry of the retreat still
in active progress. A strong rear-guard held the town, and Napoleon himself made his way across
the bridge with difficulty through the crowding masses.

Hardly had he crossed when a frightful misfortune occurred. The bridge had been mined, to blow
it up on the approach of the foe. This duty had been carelessly trusted to a subaltern, who,
frightened by seeing some of the enemy on the river-side, set fire hastily to the train. The
bridge blew up with a tremendous explosion, leaving a rear-guard of twenty-five thousand men
in Leipsic cut off from all hope of escape. Some officers plunged on horseback into the stream
and swam across. Prince Poniatowsky, the gallant Pole, essayed the same, but perished in the
attempt. The soldiers of the rear-guard were forced to surrender as prisoners of war. In this
great conflict, which had continued for four days, and in which the most of the nations of
Europe took part, eighty thousand men are said to have been slain. The French lost very heavily
in prisoners and guns. Only a hasty retreat to the Rhine saved the remainder of their army
from being cut off and captured. On the 20th Napoleon succeeded in crossing that frontier river
of his kingdom with seventy thousand men, the remnant of the grand army with which he had sought
to hold Prussia after the disastrous end of the invasion of Russia.

Germany was at length freed from its mighty foe. The garrisons which had been left in its cities
were forced to surrender as prisoners of war. France in its turn was invaded, Paris taken,
and Napoleon forced to resign the imperial crown, and to retire from his empire to the little
island of Elba, near the Italian coast. In 1815 he returned, again set Europe in flame with
war, and fell once more at Waterloo, to end his career in the far-off island of St. Helena.

Thus ended the empire founded by the great conqueror. The next to claim the imperial title
was Louis Napoleon, who in 1851 had himself crowned as Napoleon III. But his so-called empire
was confined to France, and fell in 1870 on the field of Sedan, himself and his army being
taken prisoners. A republic was declared in France, and the second French empire was at an end.

And now the empire of Germany was restored, after having ceased to exist for sixty-five years.
The remarkable success of William of Prussia gave rise to a wide-spread feeling in the German
states that he should assume the imperial crown, and the old empire be brought again into existence
under new conditions; no longer hampered by the tradition of a Roman empire, but as the title
of united Germany.

On December 18, 1870, an address from the North German Parliament was read to King William
at Versailles, asking him to accept the imperial crown. He assented, and on January 18, 1871,
an imposing ceremony was held in the splendid Mirror Hall (Galerie des Glaces) of Louis XIV.,
at the royal palace of Versailles. The day was a wet one, and the king rode from his quarters
in the prefecture to the great gates of the château, where he alighted and passed through a
lane of soldiers, the roar of cannon heralding his approach, and rich strains of music signalling
his entrance to the hall.

William wore a general's uniform, with the ribbon of the Black Eagle on his breast. Helmet
in hand he advanced slowly to the dais, bowed to the assembled clergymen, and turned to survey
the scene. I am too oppress by good information of Symonds; his communicative lung go; them cannot

at its head, to be triumphantly hailed as emperor by his own people on his own soil. All Germany,
with the exception of Austria, was for the first time fully united into an empire, the minor
princes having ceased to exist as ruling potentates.
