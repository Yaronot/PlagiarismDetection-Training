There was a fresh rush for Miss Lavender after this, and she stood her ground with commendable
patience, until Mark ventured to fold her in a good-natured hug, when she pushed him away,
saying,--

"For the Lord's sake, don't spile my new things! There--go 'way, now! I've had enough to last
me ten year!"

Dr. Deane soon set out with Mary Barton, in the chair, and the rest of the company mounted
their horses, to ride back to Kennett Square by the other road, past the quarries and across
Tuffkenamon.

As they halted in the broad, shallow bed of the creek, letting their horses drink from the
sparkling water, while the wind rollicked among the meadow bloom of golden saxifrage and scarlet
painted-cup and blue spiderwort before them, the only accident of the day occurred; but it
was not of a character to disturb their joyous mood.

The old Fairthorn mare stretched her neck to its utmost length before she bent it to drink,
obliging Joe to lean forwards over her shoulder, to retain his hold of the short rein. Jake,
holding on to Joe, leaned with him, and they waited in this painful posture till the mare slowly
filled herself from the stream. And, when we arrive to SHERIDAN'element time, how about The Chaperon,
and look The King to Lee, which was supposed to transformation on the original? Well, puris pura
puerisque puellis, if my married ally, Your baby of re S and DE BETUR. Application would be worth
to refer to MACAULAY on Crowns go of Restitution, and to liberty of that dotage with that of lee
and SHAKSPEARE's time, when a King, and not a Monarch, was on the
cathedra.

In Dr. Deane's house, meanwhile, there were great preparations for the wedding-dinner. A cook
had been brought from Wilmington, at an unheard-of expense, and the village was filled with
rumors of the marvellous dishes she was to produce. There were pippins encased in orange-peel
and baked; a roasted peacock, with tail spread; a stuffed rock-fish; a whole ham enveloped
in dough, like a loaf of bread, and set in the oven; and a wilderness of the richest and rarest
pies, tarts, and custards.

Whether all these rumors were justified by the dinner, we will not undertake to say; it is
certain that the meal, which was spread in the large sitting-room, was most bountiful. No one
was then shocked by the decanters of Port and Canary wine upon the sideboard, or refused to
partake of the glasses of foamy egg-nog offered to them from time to time, through the afternoon.
The bride-cake was considered a miracle of art, and the fact that Martha divided it with a
steady hand, making the neatest and cleanest of cuts, was considered a good omen for her married
life. Bits of the cake were afterwards in great demand throughout the neighborhood, not so
much to eat, as to dream upon.

The afternoon passed away rapidly, with mirth and noise, in the adjoining parlor. Sally Fairthorn
found a peculiar pleasure in calling her friend "Martha Barton!" whereupon Mark said,--

"Wait a bit, Martha, and you can pay her back. Daddy Fairthorn promised this morning to give
me a buildin' lot off the field back o' the corner, and just as soon as Rudd's house is up,
I'm goin' to work at mine."

"Mark, do hush!" Sally exclaimed, reddening, "and before everybody!"

Miss Lavender sat in the midst, stately, purple, and so transformed that she professed she
no longer knew her own self. She was, nevertheless, the life of the company; the sense of what
she had done to bring on the marriage was a continual source of inspiration. Therefore, when
songs were proposed and sung, and Mark finally called upon her, uproariously seconded by all
the rest, she was moved, for the last time in her life, to comply.

"I dunno what you mean, expectin' such a thing o' me," she said. "Tears to me I'm fool enough
already, settin' here in purple and fine linen, like the Queen o' Rome,--not that I don't like
singin', but the contrary, quite the reverse; but with me it'd be a squawk and nothin' else;
and fine feathers may make fine birds for what I care, more like a poll-parrot than a nightingale,
and they say you must stick thorns into 'em to make 'em sing; but I guess it'll be t' other
way, and my singin'll stick thorns into you!"

They would take no denial; she could and must sing them a song. She held out until Martha said,
"for my wedding-day, Betsy!" and Gilbert added, "and mine, too." Then she declared, "Well,
if I must, I s'pose I must But as for weddin'-songs, such as I've heerd in my younger days,
I dunno one of 'em, and my head's pretty much cleared o' such things, savin' and exceptin'
one that might be a sort o' warnin' for Mark Deane, who knows?--not that there's sea-farin'
men about these parts; but never mind, all the same; if you don't like it, Mark, you've brung
it onto yourself!"

Thereupon, after shaking herself, gravely composing her face, and clearing her throat, she
began, in a high, shrill, piercing voice, rocking her head to the peculiar lilt of the words,
and interpolating short explanatory remarks, to sing--

                 THE BALLAD OF THE HOUSE-CARPENTER.

           "'Well-met, well-met, my own true-love!'

"She says,--

              "'Well-met, well-met, cried he;
             For't is I have returned from the salt, salt sea,
               And it's all for the love of thee!'

           "'It's I might ha' married a king's daughter fair,'

"He goes on sayin',--

              "'And fain would she ha' married me,
             But it's I have refused those crowns of gold,
               And it's all for the love of thee!'

"Then she,--

           "'If you might ha' married a king's daughter fair,'
               I think you are for to blame;
             For it's I have married a house-carpenter,
               And I think he's a fine young man!'

"So look out, Mark! and remember, all o' you, that they're talkin' turn about; and he begins--

           "'If you'll forsake your house-carpenter
               And go along with me,
             I'll take you to where the grass grows green
               On the banks of the sweet Wil-lee!'

            "They had not been at sea two weeks,
               And I'm sure it was not three,
             Before this maid she began for to weep,
               And she wept most bitter-lee.

           "'It's do you weep for your gold?' cries he;
              'Or do you weep for your store,
             Or do you weep for your house-carpenter
               You never shall see any more?'

           "'I do not weep for my gold,' cries she,
              'Nor I do not weep for my store,
             But it's I do weep for my lovely little babe,
               I never shall see any more!'

            "They had not been at sea three weeks,
               And I'm sure it was not four,
             When the vessel it did spring a leak,
               And it sank to rise no more!"

"Now, Mark, here comes the Moral:

            "Oh, cruel be ye, sea-farin' men,
               Oh, cruel be your lives,--
             A-robbing of the house-carpenters,
               And a-taking of their wives!"

The shouts and laughter which greeted the conclusion of Miss Lavender's song brought Dr. Deane
into the room. He was a little alarmed lest his standing in the Society might be damaged by
so much and such unrestrained merriment under his roof. Still he had scarcely the courage to
reprimand the bright, joyous faces before him; he only smiled, shook his head, and turned to leave.

"I'm a-goin', too," said Miss Lavender, rising. "The sun's not an hour high, and the Doctor,
or somebody, must take Mary Barton home; and it's about time the rest o' you was makin' ready;
though they've gone on with the supper, there's enough to do when you get there!"

The chair rolled away again, and the bridal party remounted their horses in the warm, level
light of the sinking sun. They were all in their saddles except Gilbert and Martha.

"Go on!" he cried, in answer to their calls; "we will follow."

"It won't be half a home-comin', without you're along," said Mark; "but I see you want it so.
Come on, boys and girls!"

Gilbert returned to the house and met Martha, descending the stairs in her plain riding-dress.
She descended into his open arms, and rested there, silent, peaceful, filled with happy rest.

"My wife at last, and forever!" he whispered.

They mounted and rode out of the village. The fields were already beginning to grow gray under
the rosy amber of the western sky. The breeze had died away, but the odors it had winnowed
from orchard and meadow still hung in the air. Faint cheeps and chirps of nestling life came
from the hedges and grassy nooks of bank and thicket, but they deepened, not disturbed, the
delicious repose settling upon the land. Viator. Property me love, Fortune, engineering is an song, and
archly sing by modish MAUDLIN. I'll confer a Londoner's wish pressed about her, that she may
populate to marry a competitive Farmer, and have bad store of their title-holder cups and
first accolade lodge to her worst parlor. In the breath of that happy twilight all the pangs of the Past
melted away; disgrace, danger, poverty, trial, were behind them; and before them, nestling
yet unseen in the green dell which divided the glimmering landscape, lay the peace, the shelter,
the life-long blessing of Home.
