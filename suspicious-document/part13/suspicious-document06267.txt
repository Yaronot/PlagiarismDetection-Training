In the advance march, there had been at first nothing to do, but to drive the Russian posts
before them, and to carry off some magazines. Afterwards there were a few skirmishes between
the Aa and Riga. The Prussians, after a rather warm affair, took Eckau from the Russian General
Lewis; after which both sides remained quiet for twenty days. Macdonald employed that time
in taking possession of Dünaburg, and in getting the heavy artillery brought to Mittau, which
was necessary for the siege of Riga.

On the intelligence of his approach, on the 23d of August, the commander-in-chief at Riga made
all his troops march out of the place in three columns. The two weakest were to make two false
attacks; the first by proceeding along the coast of the Baltic sea, and the second directly
on Mittau; the third, which was the strongest, and commanded by Lewis, was at the same time
to retake Eckau, drive back the Prussians as far as the Aa, cross that river, and either capture
or destroy the park of artillery.

The plan succeeded as far as beyond the Aa, when Grawert, supported latterly by Kleist, repulsed
Lewis, and following the Russians closely as far as Eckau, defeated them there entirely, Lewis
fled in disorder as far as the Düna, which he recrossed by fording it, leaving behind a great
number of prisoners.

Thus far Macdonald was satisfied. It is even said, that at Smolensk, Napoleon thought of elevating
Yorck to the dignity of a marshal of the empire, at the same time that at Vienna he caused
Schwartzenberg to be named field-marshal. The claims of these two commanders to the honour
were by no means equal.

In both wings, disagreeable symptoms were manifested; with the Austrians, it was among the
officers that they were fermenting; their general kept them firm in their alliance with us;
he even apprised us of their bad disposition, and pointed out the means of preventing the contagion
from spreading among the other allied troops which were mixed with his.

The case was quite the contrary with our left wing; the Prussian army marched without the least
after-thought, at the very time that its general was conspiring against us. On the right wing,
therefore, during the time of combat, it was the leader who drew his troops after him in spite
of themselves, while, on the left wing, the troops pushed forward their commander, almost in
spite of himself.

Among the latter, the officers, the soldiers, and Grawert himself, a loyal old warrior, who
had no political feelings, entered frankly into the war. They fought like lions on all occasions
when their commander left them at liberty to do so; they expressed themselves anxious to wash
out, in the eyes of the French, the shame of their defeat in 1806, to reconquer our esteem,
to vanquish in the presence of their conquerors, to prove that their defeat was only attributable
to their government, and that they were worthy of a better fate.

Yorck had higher views. He belonged to the society of the Friends of Virtue, whose principle
was hatred of the French, and whose object was their complete expulsion from Germany. But Napoleon
was still victorious, and the Prussian afraid to commit himself. Besides, the justice, the
mildness, and the military reputation of Macdonald had completely gained the affection of his
troops. They said "they had never been so happy as when under the command of a Frenchman."
In fact, as they were united with the conquerors, and shared the rights of conquest with them,
they had allowed themselves to be seduced by the all-powerful attraction of being on the side
of the victor.

Every thing contributed to it. Their administration was directed by an intendant and agents
taken from their own army. They lived in abundance. It was on that very point, however, that
the quarrel between Macdonald and Yorck began, and that the hatred of the latter found an opening
to diffuse itself.

First of all, some complaints were made in the country against their administration. Shortly
after, a French administrator arrived, and either from rivalry or a spirit of justice, he accused
the Prussian intendant of exhausting the country by enormous requisitions of cattle. "He sent
them," it was said, "into Prussia, which had been exhausted by our passage; the army was deprived
of them, and a dearth would very soon be felt in it." By his account, Yorck was perfectly aware
of the manoeuvre. Macdonald believed the accusation, dismissed the accused person, and confided
the administration to the accuser; Yorck, filled with spite, thought henceforward of nothing
but revenge.

Napoleon was then at Moscow. The Prussian was on the watch; he joyfully foresaw the consequences
of that rash enterprise, and it appears as if he yielded to the temptation of taking advantage
of it, and of getting the start of fortune. On the 29th of September, the Russian general learned
that Yorck had uncovered Mittau; and either from having received reinforcements, (two divisions
had actually just arrived from Finland,) or from confidence of another kind, he adventured
himself as far as that city, which he retook, and was preparing to push his advantage. The
grand park of the besiegers' artillery was about to be carried off; Yorck, if we are to believe
those who were witnesses, had exposed it, he remained motionless, he betrayed it.

It is said that the chief of his staff felt indignant at this treachery; we are assured that
he represented to his general in the warmest terms, that he would ruin himself, and destroy
the honour of the Prussian arms; and that, finally, Yorck, moved by his representations, allowed
Kleist to put himself in movement. His approach was quite sufficient. But on this occasion,
although there was a regular battle, there were scarcely four hundred men put hors du combat
on both sides. As soon as this petty warfare was over, each army tranquilly resumed its former
quarters.

CHAP. VII.

On the receipt of this intelligence, Macdonald became uneasy, and very much incensed; he hurried
from his right wing, where perhaps he had remained too long at a distance from the Prussians.
The surprise of Mittau, the danger which his park of artillery had run of being captured, Yorck's
obstinacy in refusing to pursue the enemy, and the secret details which reached him from the
interior of Yorck's head-quarters, were all sufficiently alarming. But the more ground there
was of suspicion, the more it was necessary to dissemble; for as the Prussian army was entirely
guiltless of the designs of its leader, and had fought readily, and as the enemy had given
way, appearances had been preserved, and it would have been wise policy in Macdonald if he
had appeared satisfied.

He did quite the contrary. His quick disposition, or his loyalty, were unable to dissemble;
he burst out into reproaches against the Prussian general, at the very moment when his troops,
satisfied with their victory, were only looking for praise and rewards. Yorck artfully contrived
to make his soldiers, whose expectations had been frustrated, participators in the disgust
of a humiliation which had been reserved solely for himself.

We find in Macdonald's letters the real causes of his dissatisfaction. He wrote to Yorck, "that
it was shameful that his posts were continually attacked, and that in return he had never once
harassed the enemy; that ever since he had been in sight of them, he had done no more than
repel attacks, and in no one instance had ever acted on the offensive, although his officers
and troops were filled with the best dispositions." This last remark was very true, for in
general it was remarkable to see the ardour of all these Germans for a cause completely foreign
to them, and which might to them even appear hostile.

They all rivalled each other in eagerness to rush into the midst of danger, in order to acquire
the esteem of the grand army, and an eulogium from Napoleon. Their princes preferred the plain
silver star of French honour to their richest orders. At that time the genius of Napoleon still
appeared to have dazzled or subdued every one. Equally munificent to reward as prompt and terrible
to punish, he appeared like one of those great centres of nature, the dispenser of all good.
In many of the Germans, there was united with this feeling that of a respectful admiration
for a life which was so completely stamped with the marvellous, which so much affects them.

But their admiration was a consequence of victory, and our fatal retreat had already commenced;
already, from the north to the south of Europe, the Russian cries of vengeance replied to those
of Spain. They crossed and echoed each other in the countries of Germany, which still remained
under the yoke; these two great fires, lighted up at the two extremities of Europe, were gradually
extending towards its centre, where they were like the dawn of a new day; they covered sparks
which were fanned by hearts burning with patriotic hatred, and exalted to fanaticism by mystic
rites. Gradually, as our disaster approached to Germany, there was heard rising from her bosom
an indistinct rumour, a general, but still trembling, uncertain and confused murmur.

The students of the universities, bred up with ideas of independence, inspired by their ancient
constitutions, which secure them so many privileges, full of exalted recollections of the ancient
and chivalrous glory of Germany, and for her sake jealous of all foreign glory, had always
been our enemies. Total strangers to all political calculations, they had never bent themselves
under our victory. Since it had become pale, a similar spirit had caught the politicians and
even the military. The association of the Friends of Virtue gave this insurrection the appearance
of an extensive plot; some chiefs did certainly conspire, but there was no conspiracy; it was
a spontaneous movement, a common and universal sensation.

Alexander skilfully increased this disposition by his proclamations, by his addresses to the
Germans, and by the distinction which he made in the treatment of their prisoners. As to the
monarchs of Europe, he and Bernadotte were as yet the only ones who marched at the head of
their people. All the others, restrained by policy or feelings of honour, allowed themselves
to be anticipated by their subjects.

This infection even penetrated to the grand army; after the passage of the Berezina, Napoleon
had been informed of it. Communications had been observed to be going on between the Bavarian,
Saxon, and Austrian generals. On the left, Yorck's bad disposition increased, and communicated
itself to a part of his troops; all the enemies of France had united, and Macdonald was astonished
at having to repel the perfidious insinuations of an aide-de-camp of Moreau. The impression
made by our victories was still however so deep in all the Germans, they had been so powerfully
kept under, that they required a considerable time to raise themselves.

On the 15th of November, Macdonald, seeing that the left of the Russian line had extended itself
too far from Riga, between him and the Düna, made some feigned attacks on their whole front,
and pushed a real one against their centre, which he broke through rapidly as far as the river,
near Dahlenkirchen. The whole left of the Russians, Lewis, and five thousand men, found themselves
cut off from their retreat, and thrown back on the Düna. Lewis vainly sought for an outlet;
he found his enemy every where, and lost at first two battalions and a squadron. He would have
infallibly been taken with his whole force, had he been pressed closer, but he was allowed
sufficient space and time to take breath; as the cold increased, and the country offered no
means of escape, he ventured to trust himself to the weak ice which had begun to cover the
river. He made his troops lay a bed of straw and boards over it, in that manner crossed the
Düna at two points between Friedrichstadt and Lindau, and re-entered Riga, at the very moment
his comrades had begun to despair of his preservation.

The day after this engagement, Macdonald was informed of the retreat of Napoleon on Smolensk,
but not of the disorganization of the army. A few days after, some sinister reports brought
him the news of the capture of Minsk. He began to be alarmed, when, on the 4th of December,
a letter from Maret, magnifying the victory of the Berezina, announced to him the capture of
nine thousand Russians, nine standards, and twelve cannon. The admiral, according to this letter,
was reduced to thirteen thousand men.

On the third of December the Russians were again repulsed in one of their sallies from Riga,
by the Prussians. Yorck, either from prudence or conscience, restrained himself. Macdonald
had become reconciled to him. On the 19th of December, fourteen days after the departure of
Napoleon, eight days after the capture of Wilna by Kutusoff, in short when Macdonald commenced
his retreat, the Prussian army was still faithful.

CHAP. VIII.

It was from Wilna, on the 9th of December, that orders were transmitted to Macdonald, of which
a Prussian officer was the bearer, directing him to retreat slowly upon Tilsit. No care was
taken to send these instructions by different channels. They did not even think of employing
Lithuanians to carry a message of that importance. In this manner the last army, the only one
which remained unbroken, was exposed to the risk of destruction. The form was blend by the sensitivity

 He wrote
"that he could not understand the reason of this delay; that he had sent a number of officers
and emissaries with orders to Yorck to rejoin him, but that he had received no answer. In consequence,
when the enemy was advancing against him, he was compelled to suspend his retreat; for he could
not make up his mind to desert this corps, to retreat without Yorck; and yet this delay was
ruinous." This letter concluded thus:--"I am lost in conjectures. If I retreat, what would
the Emperor say? what would be said by France, by the army, by Europe? Would it not be an indelible
stain on the tenth corps, voluntarily to abandon a part of its troops, and without being compelled
to it otherwise than by prudence? Oh, no; whatever may be the result, I am resigned, and willingly
devote myself as a victim, provided I am the only one:" and he concluded by wishing the French
general "that sleep which his melancholy situation had long denied him."

On the same day, he recalled Bachelu and the Prussian cavalry, which was still at Regnitz,
to Tilsit. It was night when Bachelu received the order; he wished to execute it, but the Prussian
colonels refused; and they covered their refusal under different pretexts. "The roads," they
said, "were not passable. They were not accustomed to make their men march in such dreadful
weather, and at so late an hour! They were responsible to their king for their regiments."
The French general was astonished, commanded them to be silent, and ordered them to obey; his
firmness subdued them, they obeyed, but slowly. A Russian general had glided into their ranks,
and pressed them to deliver up this Frenchman, who was alone in the midst of those who commanded
them; but the Prussians, although fully prepared to abandon Bachelu, could not resolve to betray
him: at last they began their march.

At Regnitz, at eight o'clock at night, they had refused to mount their horses; at Tilsit, where
they arrived at two in the morning, they refused to alight from them. At five o'clock in the
morning, however, they had all gone to their quarters, and as order appeared to be restored
among them, the general went to take some rest. But the obedience had been entirely feigned,
for no sooner did the Prussians find themselves unobserved, than they resumed their arms, went
out with Massenbach at their head, and escaped from Tilsit in silence, and by favour of the
night. The first dawn of the last day of the year 1812, informed Macdonald that the Prussian
army had deserted him.

It was Yorck, who, instead of rejoining him, deprived him of Massenbach, whom he had just recalled.
His own defection, which had commenced on the 26th of December, was just consummated. On the
30th of December, a convention between Yorck and the Russian general Dibitch was concluded
at Taurogen. "The Prussian troops were to be cantoned on their own frontiers, and remain neutral
during two months, even in the event of this armistice being disapproved of by their own government.
At the end of that time, the roads should be open to them to rejoin the French troops, should
their sovereign persist in ordering them to do so."

Yorck, but more particularly Massenbach, either from fear of the Polish division to which they
were united, or from respect for Macdonald, showed some delicacy in their defection. They wrote
to the marshal. Yorck announced to him the convention he had just concluded, which he coloured
with specious pretexts. "He had been reduced to it by fatigue and necessity; but," he added,
"that whatever judgment the world might form of his conduct, he was not at all uneasy about;
that his duty to his troops, and the most mature reflexion, had dictated it to him; that, finally,
whatever might be the appearances, he was actuated by the purest motives."

Massenbach excused himself for his clandestine departure. "He had wished to spare himself a
sensation which his heart felt too painfully. He had dreaded, lest the sentiments of respect
and esteem which he should preserve to the end of his life for Macdonald, should have prevented
him from doing his duty."

Macdonald saw all at once his force reduced from twenty-nine thousand to nine thousand, but
in the state of anxiety in which he had been living for the last two days, any termination
to it was a relief.

CHAP. IX.

Thus commenced the defection of our allies. I shall not venture to set myself up as a judge
of the morality of this event; posterity will decide upon it. As a contemporaneous historian,
however, I conceive myself bound not only to state the facts, but also the impression they
have left, and such as it still remains, in the minds of the principal leaders of the two corps
of the allied army, either as actors or sufferers.

The Prussians only waited for an opportunity to break our alliance, which was forced upon them;
when the moment arrived, they embraced it. Not only, however, did they refuse to betray Macdonald,
but they did not even wish to quit him, until they had, as it may be said, drawn him out of
Russia and placed him in safety. On his side, when Macdonald became sensible that he was abandoned,
but without having positive proofs of it, he obstinately remained at Tilsit, at the mercy of
the Prussians, sooner than give them a motive of defection, by too speedy a retreat.

The Prussians did not abuse this noble conduct. There was defection on their part, but no treachery;
which, in this age, and after the evils they had endured, may still appear meritorious; they
did not join themselves with the Russians. When they arrived on their own frontier, they could
not resign themselves to aid their conqueror in defending their native soil against those who
came in the character of their deliverers, and who were so; they became neutral, and this was
not, I must repeat, until Macdonald, disengaged from Russia and the Russians, had his retreat free.

This marshal continued it from Königsberg, by Labiau and Tente. His rear was protected by Mortier,
and Heudelet's division, whose troops, newly arrived, still occupied Insterburg, and kept Tchitchakof
in check. On the 3d of January he effected his junction with Mortier and covered Königsberg.

It was, however, a happy circumstance for Yorck's reputation, that Macdonald, thus weakened,
and whose retreat his defection had interrupted, was enabled to rejoin the grand army. The
inconceivable slowness of Wittgenstein's march saved that marshal; the Russian general, however,
overtook him at Labiau and Tente; and there, but for the efforts of Bachelu and his brigade,
the valour of the Polish Colonel Kameski, and Captain Ostrowski, and the Bavarian Major Mayer,
the corps of Macdonald, thus deserted, would have been broken or destroyed; in that case Yorck
would appear to have betrayed him, and history would, with justice, have stigimatized him with
the name of traitor. Six hundred French, Bavarians, and Poles, remained dead on these two fields
of battle; their blood accuses the Prussians for not having provided, by an additional article,
for the safe retreat of the leader whom they had deserted.

The King of Prussia disavowed Yorck's conduct. He dismissed him, appointed Kleist to succeed
him in the command, ordered the latter to arrest his late commander, and send him, as well
as Massenbach, to Berlin, there to undergo their trial. But these generals preserved their
command in spite of him; the Prussian army did not consider their monarch at liberty; this
opinion was founded on the presence of Augereau and some French troops at Berlin.

Frederick, however, was perfectly aware of the annihilation of our army. At Smorgoni, Narbonne
refused to accept the mission to that monarch, until Napoleon gave him authority to make the
most unreserved communication. He, Augereau, and several others have declared that Frederick
was not merely restrained by his position in the midst of the remains of the grand army, and
by the dread of Napoleon's re-appearance at the head of a fresh one, but also by his plighted
faith; for every thing is of a mixed character in the moral as well as the physical world,
and even in the most trifling of our actions there is a variety of different motives. But,
finally, his good faith yielded to necessity, and his dread to a greater dread. He saw himself,
it was said, threatened with a species of forfeiture by his people and by our enemies.

It should be remarked that the Prussian nation, which drew its sovereign toward Yorck, only
ventured to rise successively, as the Russians came in sight, and by degrees, as our feeble
remains quitted their territory. A single fact, which took place during the retreat, will paint
the dispositions of the people, and show how much, notwithstanding the hatred they bore us,
they were curbed under the ascendancy of our victories.

When Davoust was recalled to France, he passed, with only two attendants, through the town
of X * * *. The Russians were daily expected there; its population were incensed at the sight
of these last Frenchmen. Murmurs, mutual excitations, and finally, outcries, rapidly succeeded
each other; the most violent speedily surrounded the carriage of the marshal, and were already
about to unharness the horses, when Davoust made his appearance, rushed upon the most insolent
of these insurgents, dragged him behind his carriage, and made his servants fasten him to it.
Frightened at this action, the people stopped short, seized with motionless consternation,
and then quietly and silently opened a passage for the marshal, who passed through the midst
of them, carrying off his prisoner.

CHAP. X.

In this sudden manner did our left wing fall. On our right wing, on the side of the Austrians,
whom a well-cemented alliance retained, a phlegmatic people, governed despotically by an united
aristocracy, there was no sudden explosion to be apprehended. This wing detached itself from
us insensibly, and with the formalities required by its political position.

On the 10th of December, Schwartzenberg was at Slonim, presenting successively vanguards towards
Minsk, Nowogrodeck, and Bienitza. He was still persuaded that the Russians were beaten and
fleeing before Napoleon, when he was informed at the same moment of the Emperor's departure,
and of the destruction of the grand army, but in so vague a manner that he was for some time
without any direction.

In his embarrassment he addressed himself to the French ambassador at Warsaw. The answer of
that minister authorized him "not to sacrifice another man." In consequence, he retreated on
the 14th of December from Slonim towards Bialystok. The instructions which reached him from
Murat in the middle of this movement were conformable to it.

About the 21st of December, an order from Alexander suspended hostilities on that point, and
as the interest of the Russians agreed with that of the Austrians, there was very soon a mutual
understanding. Too it gave, however, to disorder that there were limitations to practice to it--
too while it was useful and illustrative mortuum although this wash was threatening rarely

his ground stands up to relief.


On the 1st of January, 1813, however, at Königsberg, where Murat then was, the desertion of
the Prussians and the intrigues forming by Austria were not known, when suddenly Macdonald's
despatch, and an insurrection of the people of Königsberg, gave information of the beginning
of a defection, of which it was impossible to foresee the consequences. The consternation was
excessive. The seditious movement was at first only kept down by representations, which Ney
very soon changed into threats. Murat hastened his departure for Elbing. Königsberg was encumbered
with ten thousand sick and wounded, most of whom were abandoned to the generosity of their
enemies. Some of them had no reason to complain of it; but prisoners who escaped declared that
many of their unfortunate companions were massacred and thrown out of the windows into the
streets; that an hospital which contained several hundred sick was set fire to; and they accused
the inhabitants of committing these horrid deeds.

On another side, at Wilna, more than sixteen thousand of our prisoners had already perished.
The convent of St. Basil contained the greatest number; from the 10th to the 23d of December
they had only received some biscuits; but not a piece of wood nor a drop of water had been
given them. The snow collected in the courts, which were covered with dead bodies, quenched
the burning thirst of the survivors. They threw out of the windows such of the dead bodies
as could not be kept in the passages, on the staircases, or among the heaps of corses which
were collected in all the apartments. The additional prisoners that were every moment discovering
were thrown into this horrible place.

The arrival of the Emperor Alexander and his brother was the only thing that put a stop to
these abominations. They had lasted for thirteen days, and if a few escaped out of the twenty
thousand of our unfortunate comrades who were made prisoners, it was to these two princes they
owed their preservation. But a most violent epidemic had already arisen from the poisonous
exhalations of so many corses; it passed from the vanquished to the victors, and fully avenged
us. The Russians, however, were living in plenty; our magazines at Smorgoni and Wilna had not
been destroyed, and they must have found besides immense quantities of provisions in the pursuit
of our routed army.

But Wittgenstein, who had been detached to attack Macdonald, descended the Niemen; Tchitchakof
and Platof had pursued Murat towards Kowno, Wilkowiski, and Insterburg; shortly after, the
admiral was sent towards Thorn. Finally, on the 9th of January, Alexander and Kutusoff arrived
on the Niemen at Merecz. There, as he was about to cross his own frontier, the Russian emperor
addressed a proclamation to his troops, completely filled with images, comparisons, and eulogiums,
which the winter had much better deserved than his army.

CHAP. XI.

It was not until the 22d of January, and the following days, that the Russians reached the
Vistula. During this tardy march, from the 3d to the 11th of January, Murat had remained at
Elbing. In this situation of extremity, that monarch was wavering from one plan to another,
at the mercy of the elements which were fermenting around him; sometimes they raised his hopes
to the highest pitch, at others they sunk him into an abyss of disquietude.

He had taken flight from Königsberg in a complete state of discouragement, when the suspension
in the march of the Russians, and the junction of Macdonald with Heudelet and Cavaignac, which
doubled his forces, suddenly inflamed him with vain hopes. He, who had the day before believed
that all was lost, wished to resume the offensive, and began immediately; for he was one of
those dispositions who are making fresh resolutions every instant. On that day he determined
to push forward, and the next to flee as far as Posen.

This last determination, however, was not taken without reason. The rallying of the army on
the Vistula had been completely illusory; the old guard had not altogether more than five hundred
effective men; the young guard scarcely any; the first corps, eighteen hundred; the second,
one thousand; the third, sixteen hundred; the fourth, seventeen hundred; added to which, most
of these soldiers, the remains of six hundred thousand men, could scarcely handle their arms.

In this state of impotence, with the two wings of the army already detached from us, Austria
and Prussia failing us together, Poland became a snare which might close around us. On the
other hand, Napoleon, who never consented to any cession, was anxious that Dantzic should be
defended; it became necessary, therefore, to throw into it all that could keep the field.

Besides, if the truth must be told, when Murat, when at Elbing, talked of reconstituting the
army, and was even dreaming of victories, he found that most of the commanders were themselves
worn out and disgusted. Misfortune, which leads to fear every thing, and to believe readily
all that one fears, had penetrated into their hearts. Several of them were already uneasy about
their rank and their grades, about the estates which they had acquired in the conquered countries,
and the greater part only sighed to recross the Rhine.

As to the recruits who arrived, they were a mixture of men from several of the German nations.
In order to join us they had passed through the Prussian states, from whence arose the exhalation
of so much hatred. As they approached, they encountered our discouragement and our long train
of disorder; when they entered into line, far from being put into companies with, and supported
by old soldiers, they found themselves left alone, to fight with every kind of scourge, to
support a cause which was abandoned by those who were most interested in its success; the consequence
was, that at the very first bivouac, most of these Germans disbanded themselves. At sight of
the disasters of the army returning from Moscow, the tried soldiers of Macdonald were themselves
shaken. Notwithstanding this corps d'armée, and the completely fresh division of Heudelet preserved
their unity. All these remains were speedily collected into Dantzic; thirty-five thousand soldiers
from seventeen different nations, were shut up in it. The remainder, in small numbers, did
not begin rallying until they got to Posen and upon the Oder.

Hitherto it was hardly possible for the King of Naples to regulate our flight any better; but
at the moment he passed through Marienwerder on his way to Posen, a letter from Naples again
unsettled all his resolutions. The impression which it made upon him was so violent, that by
degrees as he read it, the bile mixed itself with his blood so rapidly, that he was found a
few minutes after with a complete jaundice.

It appeared that an act of government which the queen had taken upon herself had wounded him
in one of his strongest passions. He was not at all jealous of that princess, notwithstanding
her charms, but furiously so of his royal authority; and it was particularly of the queen,
as sister of the Emperor, that he was suspicious.

Persons were astonished at seeing this prince, who had hitherto appeared to sacrifice every
thing to glory in arms, suffering himself to be mastered all at once by a less noble passion;
but they forgot that, with certain characters, there must be always a ruling passion.

Besides, it was still the same ambition under different forms, and always entering completely
into each of them; for such are passionate characters. On macdonald's conception is, that there is a subaudition
in these leer; and that the message is, by his point by attractor; by lord by marshal; by equine
and by roan: one and one, as Chaucer writes; each one individually, by him
or it-ego.

This defection took place on the 16th of January, twenty-three days before Schwartzenberg detached
himself from the French army, of which Prince Eugene took the command.

Alexander arrested the march of his troops at Kalisch. There, the violent and continued war,
which had followed us all the way from Moscow, slackened: it became only, until the spring,
a war of fits, slow and intermittent. The strength of the evil appeared to be exhausted; but
it was merely that of the combatants; a still greater struggle was preparing, and this halt
was not a time allowed to make peace, but merely given to the premeditation of slaughter.

CHAP. XII.

Thus did the star of the North triumph over that of Napoleon. Is it then the fate of the South
to be vanquished by the North? Cannot that subdue it in its turn? Is it against nature that
that aggression should be successful? and is the frightful result of our invasion a fresh proof
of it?
