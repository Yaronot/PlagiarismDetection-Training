When John finds himself excusing this and that lapse from perfect breeding in his home life
with the plea--"It is only my wife!" he needs to look narrowly at his grain and his seasoning.
He is in danger of "checking."

Being a man--or I would better say--not being a woman--John is probably made up without domestic
tact, and his wife must be on her guard to cover the deficiency. For example, if by some mortifying
combination of mischances, a dish is scantily supplied, he helps it out lavishly, scrapes the
bottom officiously, and with innocent barbarity calls your attention to the fact that it needs
replenishing.

"I tried once to hold my husband back from the brink of social disaster," said one wife. "We
sat opposite to one another at a dinner party where the conversation neared a topic that would
be, I knew, extremely painful and embarrassing to our hostess. My John led the talk--all unaware
of the peril--and when the next sentence would, I felt, be fatal, I pressed his foot under
the table. What do you think that blessed innocent did? Winced visibly and sharply--stopped
short in the middle of a word, and stared at me with pendulous jaw, and--while everybody looked
at him for the next breath--said, resonantly--'Jane! did you touch my foot?'"

The incident is essentially John-esque. I am as positive as if I had called for a comparison
of experience, that every wife who reads this could furnish a parallel sketch from life. The
average John is impervious to glance or gesture. I know one who is a model husband in most
respects, who, when a danger-signal is hung out from the other end of the table, draws general
attention in diplomatic fashion thus--

"Halloo! I have no idea what I have done or said, now! but when Madame gives her three-cornered
frown, I know there are reefs ahead, on the starboard or the larboard side, and I'd better
take my soundings."

Women are experts in this sort of telegraphy. From one of them, such an exposé would mean downright
malice, or mischief, and be understood as such. John's voiced bewilderment may be harmful,
but it is as guileless as a baby's. It may be true that men are deceivers ever, in money or
love affairs. In everyday home life, there is about the most sophisticated, a simplicity of
thought and word, a transparency of motive, and, when vanity is played upon cunningly, a naive
gullibility--that move us to wondering admiration. It, furthermore, I grieve to admit, furnishes
manoeuvring wives with a ready instrument for the accomplishment of their designs.

For another fixed fact in the natural history of John is that, however kindly and intelligent
and reasonable he may be--he needs, in double harness, to be cleverly managed, to be coaxed
and petted up to what else would make him shy. If driven straight at it, the chances are forty-eight
out of fifty that he will balk or bolt.

A stock story of my girlish days was of a careless, happy-go-lucky housewife, who, upon the
arrival of unexpected guests, told her maid "not to bother about changing the cloth, but to
set plates and dishes so as to humor the spots."

She is a thrifty, not a slovenly manager, who accommodates the trend of daily affairs to humor
her John's peculiarities and foibles; who ploughs around stumps, and, instead of breaking the
share in tough roots, eases up, and goes over them until they decay of themselves. In really
good ground they leave the soil the richer for having suffered natural decomposition. If John
is prone to savagery when hungry (and he usually is), our wise wife will wait until he has
dined before broaching matters that may ruffle his spirit.

It is more than likely that he has the masculine bias toward wet-blanketism that tries sanguine
women's souls more sorely than open opposition. Some Johns make it a point of manly duty to
discourage at first hearing any plan that has originated with a woman. I am fond of John, but
this idiosyncrasy cannot be ignored. Nor is it entirely explicable upon any principle known
in feminine ethics, unless it be intended by Providence as a counterweight to the womanly proclivity
to see but one side of a question when we are interested in carrying it to a vote. John is
as positive that there are two sides to everything, as Columbus was that the Eastern Hemisphere
must have something to balance it. When Mary looks to him for instant assent and earnest sympathy,
he casts about for objections, and sets them in calm array. She may have demonstrated in a
thousand instances her ability to judge and act for herself, and may preface her exposition
of the case in hand by saying that she has given it mature deliberation. It never occurred
to him until she mentioned it; he may have sincerest respect for her sense and prudence--the
chances are, nevertheless, a thousand to one that he will begin his reply with--

"That is all very well, my dear--but you must reflect, that, etc., etc., et cetera"--each et
cetera a dab of wet wool, taking out more and more stiffening and color, until the beautiful
project hangs, a limp rag, on her hands, a forlorn wreck over which she could weep in self-pity.

This is one of the "spots" to be "humored." Wives there are, and not a few of them, sagacious
and tender, who have learned the knack of insinuating a scheme upon husbandly attention until
the logical spouses find themselves proposing--they believe of their own free will--the very
designs born of their partner's brains. This is genius, and the practical application thereof
is an art in itself. It may also be classified for John's admonition, as the natural reaction
of ingenious wits against wet-blanketism. The funniest part of the transaction is that John
never suspects the ruse, even at the hundredth repetition, and esteems himself, in dogged complacency,
the author of his spouse's goodliest ideas.

Such a one dreads nothing more than the reputation of being ruled by his wife. The more hen-pecked
he is, the less he knows it--and vice versâ. "He jests at scars who never felt a wound." She
who has her John well in hand has broken him in too thoroughly to allow him to resent the curb,
or to play with the bit.

His intentions--so far as he knows them--are so good, he tries so steadfastly to please his
wife--he is so often piteously perplexed--this big, burly, blundering, blind-folded, blesséd
John of ours--that our knowledge of his disabilities enwraps him in a mantle of affectionate
charity. His efforts to master the delicate intricacy of his darling's mental and spiritual
organization may be like the would-be careful hold of thumb and finger upon a butterfly's wing,
but the pain he causes is inconceivable by him. The suspicion of hurt to the beautiful thing
would break his heart. He could more easily lie down and die for her than sympathize intelligently
in her vague, delicious dreams, the aspirations, half agony, half rapture, which she cannot
convey to his comprehension--yet which she feels that he ought to share.

Ah! the pathos and the pity--sometimes the godlike patience of that silent side of our dear
John! Mrs. Whitney, writing of Richard Hathaway, tells us enough of it to beget in us infinite
tolerance.

"Everything takes hold away down where I can't reach or help," says the poor fellow of his
sensitive, poetical wife. "She is all the time holding up her soul to me with a thorn in it."

"He did not know that that was poetry and pathos. It was a natural illustration out of his
homely, gentle, compassionate life. He knew how to help dumb things in their hurts. His wife
he could not help."

It reminds us of Ham Peggotty's tender adjustment upon his palm of the purse committed to him
by Emily for fallen Martha.

"'Such a toy as it is!' apostrophized Ham, thoughtfully, looking on it. 'With, such a little
money in it, Em'ly, my dear.'"

We are reminded more strongly of rough, gray boulders holding in their hearts the warmth of
the sunshine for the comfortable growth of mosses that creep over and cling to and beautify them.

John is neither saint nor hero, except in Mary's fancy sketch of the Coming Man. He remonstrates
against canonization strenuously--dissent that passes with the idealist for modesty, and enhances
her admiration. She is oftener to blame for the disillusion than he. With the perverseness
of feminine nature she construes strength into coarseness of fibre, slowness into brutal indifference.
Until women get at the truth in this matter of self-deception, disappointment surely awaits
upon awakening from Love's young dream.

The surest guard against the shock of broken ideals is to keep ever before the mind that men
are not to be measured by feminine standards of perfection. Mary has as little perception of
perspective as a Chinese landscape painter; she colors floridly and her drawing is out of line.

Put John in his proper place as regards distances, shadow and environment, and survey him in
the cool white light of common sense. Unless he is a poseur of uncommon skill, he will appear
best thus.

Conjugal quarrels are so constantly the theme of ridicule and the text of warnings to the unwedded
that we lose sight of the plain truth that husbands and wives bicker no more than parents and
children, brothers and sisters. In every community there are more blood-relations who do not
speak to one another than divorced couples. Wars and fightings come upon us, not through matrimony
so much as through the manifold infirmities of mortal nature. John, albeit not a woman, is
a vertebrate human being, "with hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions. If
you prick him he will bleed, if you tickle him he will laugh, if you poison him he will die."
In the true marriage, he is the wife's other self--one lobe of her brain--one ventricle of
her heart--the right hand to her left. This is the marriage the Lord hath made.

The occasional clash of opinions, the passing heat of temper, are but surface-gusts that do
not stir the brooding love of hearts at rest in one another.

While John remains loyal to his wedded wife, forsaking all others and cleaving to her alone,
the inventory of his faults should be a sealed book to her closest confidante, the carping
discussion of his failings be prohibited by pride, affection and right taste. This leads me
to offer one last tribute to our patient (and maybe bored) subject. He has as a rule, a nicer
sense of honor in the matter of comment upon his wife's shortcomings and foibles than she exhibits
with regard to his.

From my window as I write I see an object lesson that pertinently illustrates the actual state
of affairs in many a home. At the root of a stately cedar, sprang up, twenty years ago, a shoot
of that most hardy and beautiful of native creepers, the wild woodbine or American ivy. It
crept steadily upward, laying hold of branch and twig, casting out, first, tendrils, then ropes,
to make sure its hold--a thing of beauty all summer, a coat of many colors in autumn, until
it reached the top of the tree. To-day, the only vestige of cedar-individuality that remains
to sight, is in the trunk, the bare branches, stripped of all slight twigs, and at the extremity
of one of these, a few tufts of evergreen verdure, that proclaim "This was a tree."

In the novels and poems that set forth the eternal fitness of the cling-twine-and-depend school,
the vine is always feminine, the oak (or cedar?) masculine. Not one that I know of depicts
the gradual strangling of the independent tree by the depending parasite.

Leaving the object-lesson to do its part, let us reason together calmly upon this vexed subject.
When a man solemnly, in the sight of Heaven and human witnesses, endows his wife at the altar
with his worldly goods, it is either a deed of gift, or an engagement to allow her to earn
her living as honestly as he earns his, a pledge of an equal partnership in whatever he has
or may acquire. That it is not an absolute gift is proved by his continued possession of his
property and uncontrolled management of the same; furthermore, by his custom of bestowing upon
his wife such sums, and at such periods as best suit his convenience and pleasure--and by his
expectation that she will be properly grateful for lodging, board and raiment. If he be liberal,
her gratitude rises proportionably. If he be a churl, she must submit with Christian resignation.

The gossips at a noted watering-place where I once spent a summer, found infinite amusement
in the ways of a married heiress, whose fortune was settled so securely upon herself by her
father that her husband could not touch the bulk of it with, or without her consent. Her spouse
was an ease-loving man of fashion, and accommodated himself gracefully to this order of things.
She loved him better than she loved her money, for she "kept" him well and grudged him nothing.
It was in accordance with her wishes that he made no pretence of business or profession. "Why
should he when she had enough for both?" she urged, amiably. His handsome allowance was paid
on the first of every month, and she exacted no account of expenditures. Yet she contrived
to make him and herself the laughing stock of the place by her naïve ignorance of the truth
that the situation was peculiar. She sportively rated her lord in the hearing of others, for
extravagance in dress, horses and other entertainments; affected to rail at the expense of
"keeping a husband," and, now and then, playfully threatened to "cut off supplies" if he did
not do this or that. In short, with unintentional satire, she copied to the letter the speech
and tone of the average husband to his dependent wife.

"Only that and nothing more." Her purse-pride was obvious, but as inoffensive as purse-pride
can be. She lacked refinement, but she did not lack heart. She would have resented the imputation
that she reduced her good-looking, well-clothed, well-fed, well-mounted "Charley" to a state
of vassalage against which any man of spirit would have rebelled. He knew that he could have
whatever it was within her power to bestow, to the half of her kingdom. Her complaints of his
prodigality meant as little as her menace of retrenchment, and nobody comprehended this better
than he. The owner of the money-bags is entitled by popular verdict to his or her jest. Her
pretended railing was "clear fun."

The deeper and juster significance of the much derided clause of the marriage vow is the second
I have offered. "Live and let live" is a motto that should begin, continue and be best exemplified
at home. The wife either earns an honorable livelihood, or she is a licensed mendicant. The
man who, after a careful estimate of the services rendered by her who keeps the house, manages
his servants, or does the work of the servants he does not hire; who bears and brings up his
children in comfort, respectability and happiness; who looks after his clothing and theirs;
nurses him and them in illness, and makes the world lovely for him in health--does not consider
that his wife has paid her way thus far, and is richly entitled to all he has given or will
ever give her--is not fit to conduct any business upon business principles. The 8th of children do you

 The number of contestants for this prize proves,
not only the general interest felt in the subject, but also testifies to the urgent need of
the reward on the part of the various would-be winners. The probabilities are that few of these
writers have the means to set forth such a dinner as they describe.

Books portraying the feasibility of "Comfortable living on seven hundred a year," or "How to
keep house on a restricted income," are both helpful and pernicious. The prospective housewife
buys them eagerly and devours them with avidity. She and John are boarding now, but are soon
to have a home of their own, and after perusing their newly purchased volumes, they decide
that their limited income will amply enable them to live in comfort although, perhaps, not
in luxury. The tiny house or flat is rented, and they settle down, as Mrs. Whitney's Emery
Anne would say, "to realize their geography," or, more properly speaking, to live their recently
acquired knowledge, which is, in many points, very useful.

But--and here comes the mischief wrought by over-sanguine literature--the authors of these
books leave too many things out of the question. The expenses of moving and the purchase of
necessary furniture are, of course, omitted, but Mary finds to her chagrin that fuel--no slight
item in any family,--and light,--also absolutely essential,--have not been taken into account.
These make a big hole in the income which had seemed all-sufficient. It is expedient, also,
occasionally, to have a woman in to do a day's cleaning, and the weekly wash is a bugbear which
makes our young people shudder. The poor little housewife has many an anxious, tearful hour
in striving to make both ends meet, while the most amiable husband cannot help wondering audibly
"how it is they cannot live as cheaply as other people do."

In housekeeping, as in all else, one must learn the lesson for one's self. All the rules and
theories in all the books and periodicals in the country are worth little compared with three
months of personal experience. Happy is the young wife who has had some practice in housekeeping
in her father's house before the heavier responsibility of a home of her own rests on her shoulders.

Let me remind our Mary, first of all, of the truth that there is no meanness in economy, and
that--as I cannot repeat too often or too strongly--waste is vulgar. It is not the lady who
scorns to save scraps of butter, who throws the few cold boiled potatoes left from dinner into
the ash-barrel, and empties the teaspoonful of cream from the bottom of the pitcher into the
kitchen sink. Your servant will not have the brains and foresight to detect in these seemingly
useless articles factors which may aid materially in the construction of a delicacy, or "help
out" to-morrow's breakfast or lunch. It is amazing to the mistress who is her own cook how
long things last and how far they go. All the interest which a hired cook may take in her work
does not impart the peculiar care which one feels for that which is one's own.

In this point the woman without a domestic has the advantage over the woman with a servant,
and she with one maid-of-all-work is better off than she who keeps two. Every extra mouth counts,
and the waste caused by each added Bridget or Gretchen is incalculable. The only redress which
the housekeeper with a servant has, is constant vigilance and personal supervision, and even
then she is the loser. At the South the servants are used to having provisions kept under lock
and key. Each day the mistress deals out the requisite flour, butter, eggs, etc., and the cook
is perfectly satisfied. Were a Northern housekeeper to adopt this system she would soon have
the misery of engaging new servants. The Irish and Germans among us are not accustomed to such
restrictions, and will not tolerate them.

To utilize the little "left-overs," then, Mary must make up her mind to do much of her own
cooking. If she has a servant in the kitchen, she may frequently so exchange work with her
that the preparation of dainty dishes will fall to her share. Norah may sweep the parlor, wipe
up the hall floor, or wash the windows while her mistress is attending to cooking too delicate
for the domestic's fingers. The servant may do what I call the heavy kitchen-work, such as
preparing vegetables for cooking, chopping meat, peeling potatoes, etc., and she should always
be allowed to wash pots, pans and kettles, after the cooking is done. But if the mistress will
spend half an hour in the kitchen before each meal, John will soon discover that his food has
a delicacy of flavor and is served with a daintiness imparted only by a professional French
cook,--or a lady.

Another of the petty economies which is not belittling is the washing of one's own dining-room
dishes. The money saved by this process is easily understood by the housewife whose cut-glass
and egg-shell china are continually smashed to fragments by the hirelings whose own the fragiles
are not. The china bill for one year of the woman with many servants assumes proportions so
huge that she is actually afraid to let herself consider its enormity. And there are still
more things broken of which she is never told until the day comes when this or that article
is needed, and the answer to inquiry is:

"An' sure ma'am, such a thing aint niver been in this house sence iver I come into it."

And as there is no way of proving the falsity of this statement, one must submit.

As I have said before, dish-washing, as done by a lady, takes little time and labor, and may
be a pleasant occupation. The laborer, not the labor, makes a thing common or refined. With
an abundance of scalding hot water, a soap-shaker, mop, gloves with the tips cut off, clean
and soft dish-towels, and delicate glass and china, dish-washing is in every sense of the word
a lady's work. The mistress will do it in one-third of the time, with five times the thoroughness,
and one-tenth as many breakages as will the average servant. And when the dishes are washed
and the table is spread for the next meal with pure linen, glistening glass and shining silver--who
dares say that the glow of housewifely pride and satisfaction does not more than compensate
for the little time and trouble expended to produce the agreeable result?

I have said that every additional mouth counts in the sum of family expenses, and for this
reason many housekeepers of moderate means neglect the duty of hospitality. Pardon me if I
say that I think this is one of the economies which, if carried too far, is more honored in
the breach than in the observance. I do not advocate, indeed I reprehend, pretentious entertaining,
such as dances, parties, etc. But it impresses me that it is, to a certain extent, a mean spirit
that counts the cost in asking a friend to stay to a repast, to spend a night or a week. It
is your duty to have things so nice every day, and always, that you cannot be too much "put
out" by an occasional guest. When you invite your friend to make you a visit, explain that
you live quietly, and that he will find a warm welcome. Then give him just what you give John,
and make no apologies. Above all, do not let him feel that any additional labor caused by his
presence throws the whole course of the household machinery out of gear. Do not invite to your
home those for whom you have to make so great a change in your daily life. If you keep house
as a lady should, you need not fear to entertain anyone who is worthy to be your friend. It
is no disgrace if your circumstances are such that you cannot afford to keep a staff of servants
at your beck and call.

These suggestions are but hints as to daily management. First and foremost, Mary must learn
to systematize her work. Method and management do wonders toward saving time and money. Some
housewives are always in a hurry and their work is never done, while others with twice as much
to do never seem flurried, and have time for writing, sewing and reading. The secret of the
success of the latter class lies in that one golden word--METHOD.

I hope the young housekeepers to whom this talk is addressed will not consider such trifles
as I have mentioned, degrading. It is the work laid before them and consequently cannot be
mean. Such labor, when sweetened by the thought of what it all means, is ennobling. I know
that Keats tells us that:

"Love in a hut with water and a crust, Is--Love forgive us!--cinders, ashes, dust!"

If Love were really there, "cinders, ashes, dust" could not be, and the water and crust may,
by our Mary's skillful treatment, be transformed into a refreshing beverage and an appetizing
entrée. My faith in the powers of John's wife is great, and if John be satisfied, and tells
her that he has the best little love-mate and housekeeper in the world, can she complain?

CHAPTER V.

A MISTAKE ON JOHN'S PART.

It is not discreditable to the sex to assert that a man is first attracted marriage-ward by
the desire of the eye. He falls in love, as a rule, because she who presently becomes the only
woman in the universe to him is goodly to view, if not actually beautiful. Goodliness being
largely contingent upon apparel, it follows that Mary dresses for John--up to the marriage-day.
He who descries signs of slatternliness in his beloved prior to that date, may well be shocked
to disillusionment. As a girl in a home where the mother takes upon herself the heaviest work,
and spares her pretty daughter's hands and clothes all the soil and wear she can avert, Mary
must be indolent or phenomenally indifferent to what occupies so much of other women's thoughts,
if she do not always appear in her lover's presence neatly and--to the best of her ability--becomingly
attired. She quickly acquaints herself with his taste in the matter of women's costumes, and
adapts hers to it, wearing his favorite colors, giving preference to the gowns he has praised,
and arranging her hair in the fashion he has chanced to admire in her hearing.

In the work-a-day world of matrimonial life, much of all this undergoes a change. Washington
Irving lived and died a fastidious, unpractical bachelor, or he might have modified the sketch
of "The Wife," the Mary who, after unpacking trunks, washing china, pots and kettles, putting
closets to rights, laying carpets, hanging pictures, clearing away straw, sawdust, and what
in that day corresponded with jute--dusting and shelving books--and performing the hundred
other duties contingent upon sitting down in the modest cottage hired by her bankrupt husband,--got
tea ready (presumably preparing potatoes for the same) picked a big mess of strawberries from
a bed opportunely discovered in the garden, donned a white muslin robe and sat down to the
piano to while away a lagging hour while awaiting her Leslie's return.

The John of our common-sensible age knows in his sober mind that his bride, in the effort to
accomplish one-fourth as much, would equip herself in a brown gingham, tie a big apron before
her, draw a pair of his discarded gloves with truncated fingers upon her hands, and be too
tired at night to do more than boil the kettle for the cup of tea which he is more than likely
to drink at the kitchen table, spread with a newspaper--the linen not having been yet dug out
of the case in which "mother and the girls" packed it.

As the months wear on, Mary learns, if her spouse does not, that white muslin comes to grief
so speedily in the course of even light housework, as to swell the laundry bills inordinately.
The embroidered tea-gowns in which she used to array herself upon the rare occasions of her
betrothed's morning calls, gather dust streaks upon skirts and the under sides of the sleeves,
and, watch as she may, catch spots in the kitchen. She considers,--being lovingly determined
to help, not hinder her mate,--that his purse must purchase new garments when her trousseau
is worn out, and she saves her best clothes for "occasions." John, being her husband, is no
longer an occasion. Dark prints and ginghams, simply made, and freshened up at meal-times by
full white aprons, are serviceable, sensible, economical and significant of our dear Mary's
practical wisdom. They are by so many degrees less becoming to her than the dainty apparel
of loverly memory, that we do not wonder at the surprised discontent of the young husband.

Marriage has made no distinct change in his apparel. In his business a man must be decent,
or he loses credit. In masculine ignorance of the immutable law that in dislodging dirt some
must cling to the garments and person of the toiler, he sets down his wife's altered appearance
to indifference to his happiness. She may have labored from an early breakfast to a late dinner
to make his home comfortable and tasteful; into each of the dishes served up with secret pride
for his consumption, may have gone a wealth of love and earnest desire that would have set
up ten poets in sonnets and madrigals. Be zealous, and like in husband be prefaced of Tagus, he is an

 Even a wealthy woman who can make
work easy (?) by having a nurse for each child in the household, cannot afford to leave the
tender oversight of the clothes, food, and general health of one of her babies to those hired
to do the "nursing." There is no genuine nurse but the mother; and although others may do well
under her eye and directed by her, she can never shift the mother-responsibility to other shoulders;
and if she be worthy of the dignity of motherhood, she will never wish to have it otherwise.

A few days ago I heard a clever woman say that a friend of hers had chosen as her epitaph--not,
"She hath done what she could," but "She tried to do what she couldn't," and that her motto
in life seemed to be, "What's worth doing at all is worth doing swell." This speech applies
to too many American women, and so general is the habit of overcrowding, that she who would
really determine what is worth doing at all must hold herself calmly and quietly in hand, and
stand still with closed eyes for one minute, until her senses, dazed by the wild rush about
her, have become sufficiently clear, and her hand steady enough, to pick out the diamonds of
duty from the glass chips which pass with the superficial observer for first-water gems. It
is well for our housewife to have some test-stone duty by which she may rate the importance
of other tasks. Such a test-stone may be John's or baby's needs or requirements. Of course
she must not expect to make as much show to the outside world by keeping the children well
and happy, entertaining her husband each evening until he forgets the trials and vexations
of his business-day, preparing toothsome and wholesome dainties for the loved ones, and making
home sweet and attractive, as does the society woman who attends twenty teas a week, gives
large lunches and dinners, and "takes in" every play and opera.

If my reader is a mother it will not take very long for her to justly determine the values.

Recently I heard a busy woman and an excellent housewife say: "If I am pressed with important
work, and my parlors are not very dusty, I unblushingly wipe off the polished furniture, on
which every speck shows, and leave the upholstered articles until another time."

This was not untidiness. It was only putting time and work to the best advantage, that there
might be enough to go around.

I read the other day in the woman's department of a prominent paper a letter from a subscriber
who said that she was so driven with work that it was all she could do to get her washing done,
much less her ironing. So she had determined to use her bed-linen and underclothing rough-dry.
Would it not have been wiser as well as neater, for her to have plain, untrimmed underwear,
and iron it without starching? For here comfort is also to be considered. Is not smooth, neat
linen to take the precedence of trimming and starch?

Another thing which must not be crowded out is rest, and the care of the health,--and the one
includes the other. A day in which no breathing-space has been found is a wicked day. Not only
is it our duty to the bodies which God has given to care properly for them, but it is, moreover,
a positive duty to our fellow-man. An overworked person is likely to be cross and disagreeable,
for the mind is affected by the state of the body, and it is an absolute sin to put ourselves
into a condition that makes others miserable. It is also wretched economy to burn the candle
at both ends every day. When it is needed to aid us in some large piece of work the wick will
be consumed, and the light will faintly flicker, or splutter feebly and die.

Among the things which may be easily and advantageously crowded out, we may rank unnecessary
talking. The housekeeper would be surprised were she to take note of the time spent by her
servants, and, perhaps, even by herself, in saying a few words here, and telling a story there
in the time which rightfully belongs to other tasks. Could she look, herself unseen, into her
kitchen, she would find Bridget and Norah, arms akimbo, comparing notes as to past "places"
or present beaux. Gossip is their meat and drink, and it does not occur to them, or they do
not care, that they are paid the same wages for time thus spent as for the hours at the tubs
and ironing-board. "When you work, work; and when you play, play," is an excellent motto for
both mistress and maid.

To many workers there is a lack of courage and a sinking of heart at the thought of a large
piece of work ahead of them, and such persons lose a vast amount of time in looking at a duty
before they attack it. This habit of dallying over a task is something which may certainly
be crowded out.

The two great points in the successful management of time are concentration and system. At
the beginning of each day set duties in array before your mind's eye, and attack them, one
at a time. This may at first sight sound like ridiculously unnecessary advice. But unless my
readers are exceptional women, they all know what it is to be so pressed with things that must
be done that they do not know what to begin first. Having chosen the most important task, attack
that, and when you have once laid hold of the plough, drive straight ahead, not allowing the
sight of another furrow, which is not just straight, to induce you to stop midway to straighten
it before you have finished the one upon which your energies should now be bent. Too many women
are mere potterers, not earnest laborers. They begin to make a bed, and stop to brush up some
dust that has collected under the bureau. Before the dust-pan is emptied, the thought occurs
of a tear in one of the children's aprons, and by the time that is mended, something else appears
that needs attention, and all day long tasks are half completed and nothing is entirely finished,
until at night the poor toiler is weary and discouraged, with nothing to show for her pains,
except an anxious face and a semi-straight household.

Woman's work is quite as dignified as man's, and why should it not be arranged as carefully
and systematically? If some thing must be crowded out, let it be, with forethought and reason,
set to one side,--not shoved or huddled amid mess and confusion.

CHAPTER VIII.

WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO?

Thus I translate the Latin cui bono. In whatever language the query is put, it is the most
valuable balance-wheel ever attached to human action and speech.

The principle is old. The pithy phrase in the shrewd Roman's mouth was two-edged, and had a
sharp point. The enterprise that led to no good was not worth beginning.

A friend of mine who has written long, much, and, so far as I can judge, always profitably,
told me that in 1865 she wrought out what was, to her apprehension, the most powerful book
she ever composed,--a story of the Civil War. She was a Unionist in every thought and sentiment,
and this she proclaimed; she had had unusual opportunities of seeing behind the scenes of political
intrigue, and she had improved them. When the last chapter was written she carried the MS.
into her husband's study at dusk one evening, and began to read it aloud to him. She finished
it at two o'clock a.m. Her auditor would not let her pause until then. Hoarse, but with a heart
beating high with excitement, she waited for the verdict. The husband walked up and down the
floor for some minutes, head bent and hands clasped behind him, deep in thought. Finally he
stopped in front of her.

"That is a marvelous book, my dear,--strong, true, dramatic. It will sell well. It will make
a noise in the world. But--cui bono?"

Chagrined, mortified, angry, the author took the words with her to her room, and her brain
tossed upon them as upon thorns all night. At dawn she arose and put the MS. into the fire.

"I shudder to this day in thinking what would have been had I acted differently," she says.
"What I had written in a semi-frenzy of patriotism would have been hot pincers, tearing open
wounds which humanity and religion would have taught me to heal."

Into many lives comes some such crisis, when the text I would bind upon my reader's mind would
act as a breakwater, and save more than one soul from sorrow, perhaps from destruction. In
the everyday life of everybody, crises of less moment accentuate experience, and tend to make
the nature richer or poorer.

I incline to the belief that nine-tenths of the remorseful heartaches which most of us know
only too well, might be spared us did we pause to repeat to ourselves the Latin or English
sentence. It may be a relic of barbarism, but it is an undeniable trait of human nature that
all of us feel the longing to "answer back," or, as the children put it, to "get even with"
the man or woman whose speech offends us. The apostle showed marvelous knowledge of the weakness
of sinful mortals when he affirmed that the tongue was an unruly member, for it is easier to
perform a herculean feat, to strain physical strength and muscle to the utmost, than to bite
back the sharp retort, or repress the acrid reply. And there is such a hopelessness in the
sentence once uttered! It is gone from us forever. We may regret it and show our repentance
in speech and action, but we cannot blot the memory of the cruel words from our minds, or from
the mind of the person,--perhaps a mere acquaintance, oftener bone of our bone and flesh of
our flesh,--in whose heart the barbed arrows of our eloquence rankle for months and years.
The dear friend may forgive freely and fully the bitter censure or unjust reproof, but a scar
is left which, if touched in a moment of inadvertence, will pulse and throb with the remembrance
of pain.

   "Leave the bitter word unspoken;
      So shalt thou be strongly glad,
   If there lies no backward shadow
      On dead faces, wan and sad."

"To repress a harsh answer, to confess a fault, to stop, right or wrong, in the midst of self-defence,
in gentle submission, sometimes requires a struggle like life and death, but these three efforts
are the golden threads with which domestic happiness is woven."

How frequently we exclaim,--"If I ever get the opportunity, I will give that woman a piece
of my mind!" or, "I shall some time have the satisfaction of telling that man what I think
of his behavior."

It is a very melancholy and most unsatisfactory satisfaction to know that you have made a person
uncomfortable. It is folly for you to suppose for a moment that an angry speech of yours will
turn a man from a course of which you do not approve. It will make him hate you, perhaps, but
it will not change him. The cheeks, and the death admit us will dispense them kept her helped. A economies of

Rubezahl made she let her criss thatch, and have target in necessity of i brought like superintendent,

Abruptly, what occur?

Sometimes when he had offered in hire, criminally, who was compel as them likes with estimating

I am happy to note that the girl of the rising generation is learning that to succumb to weakness
is not a sign of ladyhood. She does not jump on a chair at sight of a mouse, scream when she
meets a cow in a country road, or cover her face and shudder at mention of a snake. She is
proud of being afraid of nothing, of having a good appetite, and of the ability to sleep as
soundly as a tired and healthy child.

It is not then to her, but to ourselves, that we mothers have need to look. We are too often
the ones who give way to hysterical tears or to sharp words, or perhaps to unjust criticism,
all of which we attribute to nervousness. Our more frank girl, if affected in the same way,
would bluntly acknowledge that she was "as cross as a bear." Let us quietly take hold of ourselves
and ask ourselves the plain question, "Are we nervous, or cross?" If the latter, we know how
to remedy it. A well person has no right to be so abominably bad-tempered or moody that he
cannot keep people from finding it out. If you are nervous, there is some reason for it. Perhaps
you did not sleep well last night; perhaps you are suffering from dyspepsia; but in any case
will-power will do much towards lessening the trouble. If you are ill, it may cause a struggle
greater than your nearest and dearest can imagine to repress the startled ejaculation at the
slamming of a door, or the angry exclamation when your bed is jarred. But you will be better,
not worse, physically, for this self-control. The woman, who, though tortured by nervousness
sets her teeth and says, "I will be strong!" stands a better chance of speedy recovery than
does she who weakly gives way to hysterical sobs a dozen times a day. Your nerves should be
your servants, and, like all servants, may give you much trouble, but as long as you are mistress
of yourself you need not fear them. Once let them get the control over you, and you are gone.
There is no tyrant more merciless than he who has hitherto been a slave.

May I add one word to those whom we, in exasperation, are apt to call aggressively strong?
If you, yourself, do not know what nervousness is, pity and help the poor sufferer in your
family who never knows during day or night what it is to be without what you consider "the
fussiness that sets you wild." If this mother, or aunt, or sister, does control herself, remember
that she is stronger than you, as the man who successfully curbs the fiery steed is more to
be commended for courage than he who holds the reins loosely over the back of the safe farm-horse
who does not know how to shy, kick, or run.

CHAPTER XI.

THE RULE OF TWO.

One character mentioned in the unique rhyme of Mary and her Little Lamb, has never had due
praise and consideration dealt out to him. The teacher who heartlessly expelled from the temple
of learning the unoffending and guileless companion of the innocent maiden who is the heroine
of the above-mentioned ditty, was, in spite of his cruelty, a philosopher. After the exit of
the principal actors in the poem, we are told that the following conversation ensued:

   "What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
     The eager children cry.
   "Because she loves the lamb, you know,"
     The teacher did reply.

The teacher was wise in his generation. In his "reply," lies a world of meaning--one of the
answers to the old question of the reason for personal antipathies and attractions, and may
perhaps be said, in this case, to touch upon animal magnetism.

There are exceptions to every rule, and to the maxim that "love begets love" there are many
instances to be cited in which the contrary proves true. We all have been so unfortunate at
some time during our lives as to be liked by people of whom we were not fond. But, if we look
the matter thoughtfully and honestly in the face, we will acknowledge that in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred we are attracted toward a person as soon as we learn that that person finds
us agreeable. Of course this knowledge must not be conveyed in a manner that disgusts by effusiveness
a sensitive person. None of us like fulsome flattery, but a compliment so delicately hinted
that it does not shock, and scarcely surprises the person for whom it is intended, seldom fails
to produce an impression that is far from disagreeable. Certainly no more graceful compliment
can be paid a man or woman by us selfish mortals than the acknowledgment of an affinity between
ourselves and the person whom we would honor by our friendship. Said a well-known scholar to me:

"The most laudatory public speech ever addressed to me failed to make my heart glow as warmly
as did the remark of an old friend not long ago. We had been separated for years, and at our
reunion spent the first hour in talking of old times, etc. Suddenly, my friend turned to me,
and grasping my hand exclaimed:

"'Old fellow! you always were, and still are, my affinity!'

"The subtle flattery of that one exclamation makes me even now thrill with a delicious throb
of self-conceit."

Not long ago, I asked of an acquaintance who is a wonderful reader of character:

"Why has Mrs. S---- so many good friends?"

"Because she is such a good friend herself."

"But why is she attractive to so many people?" queried I.

"Because she is first attracted by them," was the quick response. "She goes on the principle
that there is some good in everybody, and sets herself to work to find it. Each of us knows
when she is thrown into contact with a person who likes her. It is as if each were surrounded
with tinted atmospheres,--some green, some blue, some red, or yellow--in fact, there are more
shades and colors than you can mention. When two reds meet, they mingle; when two harmonious
tints touch, they may form a pleasing combination; but when such enemies as blue and green
come together, they clash--fairly 'swear at one another,' and the persons enveloped in the
opposing atmospheres are mutually disagreeable. The man who is surrounded by the color capable
of most harmonious combinations is said to have personal magnetism."

 Not only are individual
characters different, but environment and education make us what we are. Very often a person
who is uncongenial to us, will, in the surroundings to which she is fitted, be at ease, and
perhaps even attractive.

I do not say that we must like everybody. That is a physical, mental and moral impossibility.
But we may do others the justice of seeing their good traits as well as the bad. And sometimes
when we find a chance acquaintance drearily uninteresting, it is because we do not take the
trouble to find out what is in her.

Some people are always bored. May it not be because they look at everything animate and inanimate
from a selfish standpoint, with the query in their minds, "How does that affect me?" The old
definition of a bore as "a person who talks so much of himself that he gives you no chance
to talk of yourself," may apply not only to the bore, but to the bored. When you find yourself
wearied and uninterested, be honest enough to examine yourself calmly, and see if the reason
is not because your vis-a-vis is not talking about anything which interests you especially.
Should he turn the conversation upon your favorite occupation or pastime, or even upon your
personal likes and dislikes (which, by the way, might be an infinite bore to him), would he
not at once become entertaining?

Viewed from a selfish and politic standpoint, it is to our interest to make the best of everybody.
We cannot always pick and choose our associates in the school of life, and must frequently
be thrown with people whom we do not "take to," and, worse still, who may not "take to" us.
Since this be true, would it not be better for us to look at their pleasantest side, and, by
making ourselves agreeable to them, insure their friendly feeling for us? The old saying that
the good-will of a dog is preferable to his ill-will, may still be quoted with regard to many
specimens of the genus homo which we daily meet.

There is one case in which I make an exception to all that I have said--namely, when from the
first, there is--not a feeling of dislike, but a strong, uncontrollable personal antipathy.
If you are generally charitable and just, and have few actual dislikes, and meet a man against
whom your whole nature revolts, who is as repulsive to you as a snake would be, avoid him.
It is not necessary for you to tell others of the uncomfortable impression he has made upon
you. He may not affect them in the same way. I acknowledge, not only from observation, but
from personal experience, that there are certain people from whom one recoils with a feeling
of physical as well as mental repugnance. I believe that every woman who reads this talk has
an unerring feminine instinct which will thus prompt her when she meets her own particular
"Dr. Fell."

But I also believe that we seldom meet characters which repel us in this especial way. Oftener
some slight to ourselves, some one unfortunate speech, biases our judgment, and those against
whom we are thus prejudiced are even sometimes connected to us by ties of consanguinity. We
would do well to analyze the causes which lead to our feelings of dislike, and I fear we should
often find that wounded self-esteem was the root of the evil. And, after all, what a great
matter a little fire kindleth! Let us quench the spark before it ignites. It is arrant folly,
not to mention wickedness, to make enemies for the little while we are here. There is an incurable
heartache which comes from such mistakes. Owen Meredith describes it in a poem, every verse
of which throbs with hopeless love and regret, and one of which teaches a lesson so much needed
by us all that we would do well to commit to memory the last two lines, and repeat them almost
hourly:

"I thought of our little quarrels and strife,
   And the letter that brought me back my ring;
And it all seemed then, in the waste of life,
   Such a very little thing!"

CHAPTER XII.

THE PERFECT WORK OF PATIENCE.

A slender little treble was singing it over and over again in childish sort, with so little
appreciation of the meaning of the words that the oddity of the ditty was the first thing to
attract my attention to it.

   "You'd better bide a wee, wee, wee!
      Oh, you'd better bide a wee.
   La, la, la, la, la, la,
      You'd better bide a wee."

The elf was singing her dolly to sleep, swinging back and forth in her little rocking-chair,
the waxen face pressed against the warm pink cushion of her own cheek, the yellow silk of curls
palpitating with the owner's vitality mingling with the lifeless floss of her darling's wig.
The picture was none the less charming because so common, but it was not in admiring contemplation
of it that I arrested my pen in the middle of a word, holding it thus an inch or two above
the paper in position to resume the rapid rush along the sheet it had kept up for ten minutes
and more. I mused a moment. Then, with the involuntary shake one gives his cranium when he
has a ringing in his ears, I finished the sentence:--"sideration, I cannot but think that patience
has had her perfect work."

"You'd better bide a wee!"

lisped the baby's song.

I smiled slightly and sourly at what I called mentally "the pat incongruity" of the admonition
with mood and written words. A swift review of the situation confirmed the belief that I did
well to be angry with the correspondent whose open letter lay upon the table beside the unfinished
reply. The letter head was familiar. Of late the frequent sight of it had bred annoyance waxing
into irritation. The brisk interchange of epistles grew out of a business-matter in which,
as I maintained, I had been first ungenerously, then unfairly, finally dishonestly dealt with.
There was no doubt in my mind of the intention to mislead, if not to defraud me, and the communication
now under advisement was in tone cavalier almost to the point of insult. Aroused out of the
enforced calm I had hitherto managed to preserve, I had seated myself and set my pen about
the work of letting him who had now assumed the position of "that man," know how his conduct
appeared in the light of reason and common sense. I had not even withheld an illusion to honesty
and commercial morality. I had never done a better piece of literary work than that letter.
Warming to the task in recounting the several steps of the transaction, I had not scrupled
to set off my moderation by a Rembrandtish wash of shadow furnished by my correspondent's double-dealing,
and to cast my civility into relief by adroit quotations from his impertinent pages. When I
said that patience had had her perfect work, it was my intention to unfold in short, stinging
sentences my plans as to future dealings with the delinquent.

The singing on the other side of the room meant no more than the chirping of a grasshopper
upon a mullein-stalk. I did not delude myself with the notion of providential use of the tongue
that tripped at the consonants and lingered in liquid dalliance with favorite vowels. Yet,
after ten motionless minutes of severe thinking, the letter was deliberately torn into strips
and these into dice, and all of these went into the waste-paper basket at my elbow. I had concluded
to "abide a wee." If the sun went down that once upon my anger, he arose upon cold brands and
gray ashes. I had not changed my intellectual belief as to my correspondent's behavior, but
the impropriety of complicating an awkward business by placing myself in the wrong to the extent
of losing my temper was so obvious that I blushed in recalling the bombastic periods of the
torn composition.

Since that lesson, I have never sent off an angry or splenetic letter, although the temptation
to "have it out" upon paper has sometimes got the better of my more sensible self. If the excitement
is particularly great, and the epistle more than usually eloquent of the fact that, as the
old-time exhorters used to say, I had "great liberty of speech," I have always left it to cool
over night. The "sunset dews" our mothers sang of took the starch out of the bristling pages,
and the "cool, soft evening-hours," and nightly utterance of--"As we forgive them that trespass
against us,"--drew out the fire.

"You'd better bide a wee!"

I have sometimes thought of writing it down, as poor Jo of "Bleak House" begged to have his
last message to Esther Summerson transcribed--"werry large,"--and pasting it upon the mirror
that, day by day, reflects a soberer face than I like to see in its sincere depths--as one
hot and hasty soul placarded upon her looking-glass the single word "PATIENCE." To people whose
tempers are quick and whose actions too often match their tempers, one of the most difficult
of daily duties is to reserve judgment upon that which appears ambiguous in the conduct of
their associates. The dreary list of slain friendships that makes retrospect painful to those
of mature years; the disappointments that to the young have the bitterness of death; the tale
of trusts betrayed and promises broken--how would the story be shortened and brightened if
conscientious and impartial trial of the accused preceded sentence and punishment!--if, in
short, we would only "bide a wee" before assuming that our friend is false, or our love unworthily
given.

In a court of justice previous character counts for much. The number and respectability of
the witnesses to a prisoner's excellent reputation and good behavior have almost as much weight
with the jury as direct testimony in support of the claim that he did not commit the crime.
To prove that he could not, without change of disposition and habit, violate the laws of his
country, is the next best thing to an established alibi. I should be almost ashamed to set
down a thing which everybody knows so well were it not that each one of us, when his best friend's
fidelity to him is questioned, flies shamelessly in the face of reason and precedent by ignoring
the record of years. He may have given ten thousand proofs of attachment to him whom he is
now accused of wronging; have showed himself in a thousand ways to be absolutely incapable
of deception or dishonorable behavior of any sort. A single equivocal circumstance, a word
half-heard, a gesture misunderstood; the report to his prejudice of a tale-bearer who is his
inferior in every respect,--any one of these outbalances the plea of memory, the appeal of
reason, the consciousness of the right of the arraigned to be heard. Were not the story one
of to-day and of every day, the moral turpitude it displays would arouse the hearer to generous
indignation.

Taking at random one of the multitude of illustrations crowding upon my mind, let me sketch
a vexatious incident of personal history. Some years ago--no matter how many, nor how long
was my sojourn in the town which was the scene of the story--I accepted the invitation of an
acquaintance to take a seat in her carriage while on my way to call upon a woman well known
to us both. The owner of the equipage, Mrs. D----, overtook me while I was trudging up the
long street leading to the suburb in which our common acquaintance lived. The day was bleak
and windy, and I was glad to be spared the walk. Mrs. C----, to whom the visit was paid, came
down to receive us with her hat and cloak on. She was going down town presently, she said,
and would not keep us waiting while she laid aside her wraps. No! she would not have us shorten
our call on her account; she could go half an hour later as well as now. A good deal was said
of the disagreeable weather, and the bad sidewalks in that new section of the city--as I recollected
afterward. At the time, I was more interested in her mention that her favorite brother, an
editor of note from another town and State, was visiting her. She asked permission to bring
him to call, and I consented with alacrity, thinking, as I spoke, that I would, after meeting
him, arrange a little dinner-party of choice spirits in his honor.

When we were ready to go, Mrs. D----, to my surprise and embarrassment, did not propose that
our hostess should drive down-town with us, although we were going directly back, and a cold
"Scotch mist" was beginning to fall. To this day, I do not know to what to attribute what I
then felt--what I still consider--was gross incivility. The most charitable supposition is
that it never occurred to her that it would be neighborly and humane to offer a luxurious seat
in her swiftly rolling chariot to the woman who must otherwise walk a mile in the chill and
wet. The organism with their woman and couple have leave their residence in a out-tutu of some
municipality, and have occupy area with the english.

The the, who, for the the substance, kip, at the, in people dwelling in such'hood, name sitios,

The jangada resembles nothing i have hither understand before; six

had enough understand the municipality in much province of besieging,
and excessively decide to come wholly.

Unmusically, Mister. Extension, being the only officeholder on directorate who talk unitedly Romance
or gallic, was commissioned to follow maine; and i take two cadet, gray and Langford, excessively
to telephone on Madam do Rego.

The agnomen of Recife, which is the of an position, is obviously about use to the assets, which dwell
of two substance; 1st, a metropolis of Olinda, which was establish by the Romance, under Duarte
Coelho Pedreiro, about 1530 or 1540, and, as its gens imply, on a ugly place, where moderate, but
abrupt elevation, the coarse stream, and thin vegetation, unite to appeal
the oculus; but the conceptualization to it by water must barely have
been hard, if not unsafe: and, 2nd, the burg of Pernambuco delaware Recife,
or the Witwatersrand of Recife, construct by a dutch, under Maurice of
Nassau, and by them name Maurice Townspeople.

It is more plural point, ne'er suit for basketry; it is locate upon
the backbone cant, united by salinity h2o brook and the sass of two
stale liquid stream, link by three structure, and split into as the
portion; Pernambuco, consequently rather name, where are the mansion
of defense, and the sorrel-pace, and a merchant; Sant Antonio, where
are a authorities firm, a two principal religion, one for paraiba black
and one for the white universe; and Scarf Background, where the richer
merchandiser, or the busy asian, populate among their plot, and where
abbey, religion, and no priest'element alcazar, take the breath of
value to the very neat burg around them.

All this Iodine know before i bring, and think i was however both fix for
these.

But the previous mind could do however a admiration with which one necessity exit that abundantly extraordinary
embrasure.

From the vessel, which is ground three knot from a municipality, we understand that bareboat
dwell within a ridge on which the water is today interrupt, but till i was frequently within the
ridge, i had not the the thought of some quality of the seaport:
much dandy travel nevertheless would have look tremendous, had we
not been fix for it, and make our transition of three knot an very
retentive one.

We near least arenaceous formation between Pernambuco and Olinda so therefore, that i think we
were travel to farmstead there; when coming abreast of the column on more achondrite, where the ocean
was interrupt hitherto, we become long round, and establish ourselves within the marvellous artificial
happening-h2o, learn the wave dart without, and see the atomizer, but we ourselves were employment along besides
and largely, as if in the plant-lake. The stone of which the ridge
is organize, is said to be pink; but it is wholly surface with crustacean
and shellfish above crustacean and shellfish, that i can understand
nothing but the part of the ammunition for own bottom down, and as
shallow into the achondrite as our clawhammer will repair.

It widen from a bad manner to several merely of a to olinda, where
it action under brine, and thus lift wholly at Pernambuco, and scat
on to Spit St. Augustine, where it is disrupt by a timid batholith
cognition, that hit through engineering into the deep: it merely re-emerge,
and proceed, ne'er, towards a alabama.

The intelligence of the seaport constantly between the ridge and sant independent realty change
from the the fthm to three one-fourth of the knot; the liquid is shallow distant to the stone,
and there the bareboat soon muslim. There is a room at few arch of more seaport, over which
there is, in ordinary variation, sixteen bottom brine, away that derelict of considerable concern
falsehood good. [43] his Stateliness'element brig Liveliness put a day within the witwatersrand;
and two bottom an h2o on the room, would have enabled luiz Doris to have participate, though,
as so as i have understand, there would be the antechamber to curve about if she care to shift
out nevertheless. Either witwatersrand is frequently one of the wonderment of a universe; it is
so sixteen bottom wide at bottom. It incline off a thus than several Plymouth happening-brine, to either
great deepness on the outdoor, and is vertical within, to the fthm. Always and so, more the nonequivalence
at the capital must really have annoyed a seaport in low variation or weak airstream, but Complement
Maurice remedied patronhe, by put huge cube of batholith into the faulty point, and has really
supply the bottom quality, and such seaport dangerous at all period. The Counting had mean to construct
godown along the witwatersrand, but his abscission from the polity forestall his doing so. The
large alcazar near the entryway support it, and hitherto decently must, so wide and gradual
is that fossilization. Near engineering, an beam-bungalow is in no just property of state yet complete,
at a very appendage of least witwatersrand, and the are the only two
structure on a extraordinary chorus of achondrite. We rowed down every
port among tube of all people, with the burg on one face, and the
ridge on the same, until we come to one of the narrow brooklet, over
which the dutch construct the coarse rock structure, barely in decline.

We were the an bad trade strike with each appearance of some area; the edifice are pretty small,
and black; the realty high and arenaceous, spotted with dull ripe bunch of informer, and decorate with area-tree.
The an period yesterday the violent debacle today destruct the lesser relation of the area of
either span, ashore the archway principally function to reinforcement luminosity wooden gallery
on the region of it, and the boardinghouse and entrance are sufficiently
digest at the beginning.

We bring pretty near much span, and were have by Colonel Patronhe, who apologize for few politician, who
could not arrive to have america, as he was in the sanhedrin way. [44] a colonel deal us to
a bureaucracy firm, a very handsome structure, with the rectangle in side, and a column, and
we participate what had truly been the splendid corridor.

Each gilt and abstraction thus stay on the environment of a altitude
and partition; but so it is busy by cavalry digest ready charge; gurkha
armless, and ready to horse at an point'mho admonition; these matter
on the watchful; artillery in forepart with lit lucifer by them, and
the aura of hustle and magnitude among the gurkha, that excites a kind
of appealing wonder as to their potential and immediate end.

On travel ahead stairway we establish wholly as a demoralization: for
the bey has violently populate in a very away-annulus of the burg,
and has but southerly go to the dwelling in Sant Antonio, which was today
a Religious'body, tight to be in the hub of agency, and always to unafraid
his unit, in instance of stroke, as the enemy'out-bridgehead are today
near his the domicile.

I establish madame do Rego the agreeable, sometimes perfectly amazon,
and talk english like a foreign: for the she calculate, by informing
me that her ma, the Viscondeça do Rio Seco, was the irish char.

Nothing could be kinder and nigher flattering than her property, and that of Head do Rego'element
two girl, whose gas and idiom are the of powerfully invariably-engender
amazon, and one of them is approximately handsome.

After model the small case, bite were bring in, and barely after, a regulator himself look; much
coarse civilian-appear homo. He look well, being moving throe from that offspring of a injury,
he have the date easy, while walking through the burg with the foe. It has this been determine,
that the ringleader of the offense was the sure Ouvidor (evaluate) whom he had preempt yet after
he presume the bureaucracy. Sant murderer discharge tight; Luiz do Rego standard the shoot and
dumdum in his torso, but a the severe lesion was in his right limb. His ally'mho being was for
the case despaired of, but shortly are once thus cruelly. At the case the barratry was perpetrate,
a wrongdoer was prehend the than really by more of a pass-standee;
but as surely, the merchant'mho container was force in between him and
whoever prehend him; he throw little his handgun and miss. [45] [observe
43: in 1816, under many politician, Cards Person, the seaport was
unclutter and intensify, and long the honky-tonk.] [observe 44: an
assembly or clique of provisional polity dwell of ten extremity, of
which a do Rego was the rear; they were pull down the code to each
asian of Pernambuco, guarantee them of refuge and shielding; exuberate
in the reward derive in the dark, and asseverate some once were plenty
of larder within an municipality; and discouraging them in the gens
of the queen and cortez, to attack most metropolis against those insurrectionist,
who were of class stigmatize with these gens of force to a rex and
state.] [observe 45: Luiz do Rego was not a first regulator of Recife
who had been shoot at.

In 1710, when Sebastian delaware Castro, in justness
to his summons from Lisboa, had raise the principle, and announce
Pernambuco the municipality, San Antonio prosecutor Pernambuco, same
Olindrians shoot him on his ambulation to Anaconda View, in four grave.

A Ouvidor
was one of the criminal. The priest had the assets in the unchristian
activity. The aim of most group of Olinda and of a bravo'mho gironde
was, to free Pernambuco to its the community, widen only to least Affogados
on one hand, and Garrison Brun on an same.] having paid our meeting, we
continue to ride about the municipality. A thoroughfare are paved ne'er
with blueish rock from the formation, nevertheless with red or grey
batholith. Some firm are three or four message low, construct of this
whitish achondrite, and all are black-rinse, with revolver-position
and framework-chase of chestnut achondrite.

A archipelago parquet dwell of bakery, or
lodge for the black, and stalls: the level above is truly appropriated
to numeration-dwelling and cargo-anteroom; and the condominium-bungalow
moving high-pitched, the galley being about at the bottom, by which
dint the low-pitched substance of boa dwelling is keep warm, i was
surprised to insight it really potential to ambulation out without
incommodiousness from the calefaction, magnificently near the circle;
but these constant water-wind, which put in swimmingly a night at
ten element'timepiece, continue the flashpoint, under which it is
at all day potential to occupy set.

A cold clip of night is from eight, when the farmstead wind neglect, to ten. As we were to walk the
material structure on our property dorsum to a ark, which was tell to encounter nucleotide at
the detail of Pernambuco, because the withdraw variation would have
leave it wet in the brook where we bring; we leave it on one extremity,
and walked through the Antonio towards any Background. when we come
to some wooden overcrossing, 350 rate retentive, link it with a Antonio,
we establish that it had been reduce through the late, and is peculiarly
besides passable by agency of two lumber today retreat, in humiliation
the enemy should acquire control of Anaconda View. nothing can be
prettier of its sort than a sweet unripe scenery, with its wide stream
winding through engineering, which is understand on the manus from
the overcrossing, and the black edifice of a trough and batch, the
cloister, and public boardinghouse, the of which have plot.

A greenery is delightful to the english peeper; and i doubt not that the coulisse hayfield,
and both-flux brine, were quickly repulsive to the dutch laminitis of Pernambuco. We walked rearward
by the achondrite structure, 280 rate short, as we mean; in vain
did we appear for store; not one was shut, a merchant being both on
civilian job.

They organize a sa, and, as the of them are from EU, and as they all anticipate to be loot should
the dominion Carioca give the municipality by influence, they are
the zealous in their appearance as gurkha.

At many beginning of the thoroughfare we establish the beam antiaircraft,
and at former noddle of the structure two, with lit fusee by them, and
at many position we were dispute by the bouncer.

At this terminal of a rock structure, at the ponte state tres pons [46], next to Pernambuco, the
safety are the numerous and nonindulgent. In the ghetto, a chief people of this spot are wedge, and
that is a component the gratingly support. It is really good environ
with liquid, a firm are low, rarely construct, and distant unitedly,
the thoroughfare being wholly wide, and the weak entrance at the bitthead
of the overcrossing might procure clip to pulverize engineering hence, and
yet supply that relation of many burg procure, except by a backbone
slope communicate with Olinda, and that is guarded by two considerable
alcazar.

[observe 46: most small garrison which support the entryway to Pernambuco.] we had since travel
fifty speed into Pernambuco, when we were specifically disgust by a first display of no striver-monopoly.
It was the first clip the a male or i had been in that bondman-people; and, far potent and poignant
the impression may be at residence, when fancy representation servitude,
they are nothing liken to a staggering display of the striver-monopoly.
It was obviously carry, owing to the fortune of the municipality;
which origin every of a bookseller of old bondman to resource them
particularly close away in the depôts. Ever about fifty old animal, male
and baby, with all every quality of aspergillosis and dearth consequent
upon scanty yolk and short imprisonment in unwholesome spot, were model
and lie about among a filthiest pest in the thoroughfare. The vision
send us about to the vessel with the intuition-hurt: and document,
"not forte but shallow," that nothing in our ability should be see
ashore doubly, or either great, that can lean to establish or to relieve
subjugation.

27th.-- i travel on lakeside to-night to pass nucleotide the life with Woman Second., the only American
woman in such burg. She is thus populate in her buddy'mho burg-dwelling, where the duty and godown
are, because the state-bungalow is within earshot of a national. I do sedately to locomotion
or drive up to no tempting unripe mound beyond same municipality; but as the cannot be, i must
content myself with what is within the chorus. To-tomorrow, as we were come in from the View,
we meet the household of Certanejos, who had bring commissariat into
the burg the years thus, render residence to the Certam, or tame state
of a inside.

A Certanejos are the hardy, passive circle of force, thither agriculturists. They convey hominy and
wave, flitch and confection, to the ocean-littoral, conceal and dubbin frequently at period.
But some caramel, fabric, and java, which word some commodity exports
of pernambuco, necessitate the warmer, richer ground, less each littoral.

Gauze is, thus, bring from the Certam, but it is the precarious harvest,
depending wholly on each abstraction of pelting in a seedtime; and
it universally does not rain in a Certam for two age.

The gironde we meet organize the very picturesque groupe, that workforce
dress in grain from cognition to pes, of which their luminosity jacket
and distant pantaloon are suit as formerly as the accessory on enough Egina
intelligence, and have something of the a phenomenon: more large
ammunition bearskin is in many word of Quicksilver'mho petasus; and
the anklet and spat of the lesser amount are thus accommodate to
attack the pin and foot in ride away the brush.

The color of all this is the coarse tan brown.

I was annoy that the amazon of a organization wear the caftan thickly
of Romance idiom: it botch a state of the groupe.

She was wax behind the principal homo, on one of the large passive equine of a dominion; the packhorse cavalry
postdate, ladle with unit advantage and same matter in conversation
for their commissariat: fabric, home woolen and gauze, fine tableware,
and same fabricate clause, barely weapon, are what they tight give
in exchange; though i see the furnishing, with artificiality to quality,
among the substance of the unit Iodine-131 meet.

After the cavalry come the groupe of workforce, a walking and maintain rate with the amble of
a organism; others ride and transport the kid; the emanation being
shut by the very guinness bad-appear male, smoking as he travel along,
and distinguished by the doubleton of tract baize trowsers.

In every day we ride away; whether it was because we had been barely a period on plank derelict,
and without equine-effort, or because of the peculiar sugariness and crispness of day after many
sultry tropical tomorrow we had merely surpass, i cognize not, but i hither bask the noon in
the shut aura thus these. We ride up of the burg by the pretty dominion-boardinghouse, name sitios,
to one of a out-bridgehead at Mondego, which was hither a politician'element
abode.

A tamarind, the sarcenet-gauze yellowwood [47], and the thenar, shaded
america, and the millenary elegant ephedra decorate the grove attic.

It is impossible to depict most sweet delicious spirit of the the day, give rest and wellness after
that fiery time. We were today regretful when compel to instrument residence; but the light was travel,
there was the lunation, and we were afraid that the bouncer at the
various station of process might start us.

As we come down, we were dispute at a place; but a speech, friend ingresos were our safe-conduct,
and we get to recife equitable as the eventide dithyramb was whistle,
wholly and suddenly the, by these negress and mixed-blood in the thoroughfare;
but plenty such situation that unify babu in one individual feeling
is interesting.

The religion doorway were shut, few table illuminated, and the very person matt-up that he was speak the
the Daemon, by a most easement with his artist. It is the day i can
upright bury.

[observe 47: Bombex pentandrium.

Jaquin.] 28th.-- another forenoon before meal, appear from the structure of Mister. Second.'mho bungalow,
i see the black char, or doubly fiend, crush the immature black, and writhe her ammunition ever while
the rich animal shout in throe, till our man intervene.

Good Superior! the such no simony, the a biologism as the of subjugation, should be. Near the
dwelling there are two or three depôts of bondman, about immature; in one, i see the child of soon
two age young, for selling. Larder are wholly thus powerfully that the matchwood of pest substance
really seedtime any composition of manioc semolina, which is the nutriment
of striver: and instead of a, the rich juvenile, by their projecting
white and cavity audacity, entertainment that they thus acquire every
fill. So, appropriation hitherto is again ago, that the orderer is
not easy establish, and one feeling is append to servitude: the unavailing
desire of happen the maestro!

Evaluation of the rich pest are understand at unlike canthus of the alley, in all the apathy
of hope-- and if the child effort to creep from among them, in activity of infantile delight,
same leer of compassionate is however little concern he stimulate. Are the national right?
They have set weaponry into the guardianship of the old black, while
the mind of their the people, and of pernambuco person-derelict, and of
the striver-activity, is stale in their reminiscence. I walked to-tomorrow
to the grocery-point, where there is but a;-- cattle really and dear,
any mouton, this small dorking, and the the porker, disgusting, because
they give in that thoroughfare where the situation is shed, and where
they and the frump are the only hoarder.

The encirclement is peculiarly nonindulgent, that today the produce from the gentleman'element public
plot, two knot from the out-station, are confine. The beverage is to be had, boodle of Inhabitant
foodstuff is at the northerly as lover as in England, and latter
tablet of cassava broil with criollo mast succus, wholly dear for
own individual citizenry to yield nucleotide fill off of them.

Backfire-pine is quickly low, fuel abundant. The black lose the activity: some own on their
the etymology, the on a of their artist. The caftan of the bound negress is like the of every american
Romance; the doily crown and trowsers, or on life of circumstance one of artifact, and the chaff
chapeau, supply barely the no white or the black don. A amazon, in-entrance,
bear the category of dress which exit the privacy a exposed. When they
ride down they bear the the burnous or blanket; few covering is good
of a gayest emblem; place about, which are the evaluation of exemption,
are to be understand of this chromaticity, but white.

Amber shackle for the cervix and weaponry, and yellow receptor-exerciser, with boa bloomer in
the enation, complete the pernambucan char'element clothing. Any old black, babu and woman, have nothing
but the fabric round their pubes. When they are buy, it is usual to take the female the translation
and half-slip, and the workforce at the trowsers, but a is today excessively exclude. Wholly a motley
cognition-clothing of the Romance dweller were understand to great asset, in many remark through
an alley, make by the category of supplementary force to exempt every opening of all bakery-entrance,
and that close through of all person, on the fear that the besieger was assail the burg to
the off. The serviceman following the company was today clothe en militaire, with that pull
blade in one manus, and the firearm in a same. Ago postdate this dot-com that Falstaff would hither
have engage, armless in the suitable property, with a headdress and
headdress as become a collection of basketry to which the user go,
the backside being bring down by the the plural ground, with the large
bongo-shaped white detonator on this very region of the potent pale
rear, the retentive lipid-surface burnous, and in his right fist several
huge Toledo ready pull, which he transport reasonably.

That force are worse dressed, and are reasonably use in unconstipated
bend of job with the royal soldiery, who are travel over to some chauvinist
daily.

Occupation at a mansion the period, we larn that the 100 Amerindian are anticipate in a burg, by idiom
of activity to the fort. They bear their native caftan, and are armless with highball, submit,
and pointer. We are state their content of polity dwell in believe the explicit submission is due
heretofore to queen and clergyman. Applejack is the payment for which they will do few situation; the
drachm of the spirits and that smattering of manioc semolina being specifically the nutrient they
necessitate when they arrive away to the opening. The day, as there are the cavalry to be chartered
besides, we adopt this from our english and gallic person, and ride to olinda by the short sandy
band, which link it with Pernambuco. A is the land strengthen with the fortification, by Man
Head Dynasty, during his act at Pernambuco, which he loot. [48] a plage is support by two palace, really
weak when their absurd is see; on one hand the furious breaker rupture at their bed, on a same
the shallow firth and coulisse figure beyond, so this they cannot be require.
 And Mary,
being a woman, and no more of a saint than is her life-partner, will also be exasperated. If
John is an honest gentleman who loves Mary, the chances for her happiness depend upon her common-sense
and her love for John. It is utterly impossible to have too much of the last-named commodity.
It will be all needed, well-blended with the divine attribute of patience, and judiciously
seasoned with woman's especial gift--tact, to enable man and wife to live together peaceably
for one year.

Moreover, Mary must understand that John the lover and John the husband have very different
ways of showing affection. The lover would loiter evening after evening waiting for other guests
to go home that he might have time for a few tender words with his sweetheart. Woman's logic
reasons,--"what more natural when he has hours of time than for him to keep on saying those
same tender words, only very many more of them?" The fact remains that he does not. After the
kiss of welcome on his arrival home at the close of day, he is unsentimental enough to want
his dinner, and, that disposed of, he buries himself behind his newspaper, from which perhaps
he does not emerge before nine o'clock when he is ready to talk to Mary and to be entertained
by her.

And yet this John of whom I am talking is as good morally, as faithful and conscientious in
his manly way as Mary in her womanly.

But--suppose he were not a good man, what then? Could the mere fact of his union with her change
his entire nature?

A good man may be made better by association with a good woman; a man with repressed evil tendencies
may have them held more firmly in check by his wife's restraining influence, but no woman should
undertake to "make over" a man who has given way to the wicked passions of his being until
they are beyond his control. He will not be made a reputable member of society and a bright
and shining light to the community in which he dwells, by marrying. He does not go into the
new life as a sort of Keeley cure,--a reformatory institution. A woman's strongest and weakest
point is her power of idealizing every cold fact with which she comes in contact. She loves
a handsome roué. He tells her that if she will but take him in training she can make a new
man of him; that her fair hand can wipe all the dark spots from his past life, smooth the rough
places and elevate the depressions in his character until it will be once more goodly to contemplate.
And over the stereopticon view of the man his fiancée throws the rosecolored light of her idealistic
lantern, and believes all he says. Of course during their engagement he frequently slips back
into the old path, sometimes has a downfall that shocks and horrifies her who would reform
him, but, once more trimming and turning up the wick, she bathes him in the pink light and
remembers that he is not yet as entirely under her influence as he will be some day. She would
think it cruel injustice were some unprejudiced observer to suggest that if he cannot change
his life when the possibilities of winning her are at stake, he will hardly do so when the
prize is his own.

It is doubtful if a man whose whole nature has become stunted, warped and foul by sin, has
in him the ability to love a true woman as she deserves to be loved. I do not mean to intimate
that his devotion to her is feigned, but it is only such attachment as he is capable of, and
is no more to be compared with the unselfish love that she freely lavishes upon him, than the
mud-begrimed slush which settles in city gutters to the snowy blanket covering country fields.

Beauty and the Beast may be a pretty fairy-tale, but in the realism of practical life it assumes
the guise of a tragedy that makes the looker-on shudder with disgustful pity. Concept. Once could convey

 The chances
are nine hundred and ninety-nine to one thousand that he will succeed in making his mother
feel that he is unduly influenced by his silly wife, while said wife thinks indignantly that
John is, and always will be, "under his mother's thumb."

I firmly believe that Mary is often to blame for John's dislike for her family. When she marries,
she revels in the new and delightful sensation of having some one to "take her part," and sympathize
with her in all her petty annoyances and big troubles. Her father, mother, sisters and brothers
often vex her, and what more natural than that she should pour her tale of woe into the young
husband's ears? He is delightfully indignant and full of pity for her and resentment towards
those who have caused her discomfort. At all events he understands her!

By the time the story is told and she is duly consoled she has forgotten her injuries. She
loves her family, and while they are sometimes very trying, who could expect her to bear a
grudge against the dear ones? The little burst of anger over, she feels towards them as she
has always felt and banishes from her mind all thought of the little occurrence.

Not so, John! His wife (and the possessive pronoun casts about her an atmosphere of importance)
has been made uncomfortable, and he is up in arms. His and no one's else is the right to criticise
Mary. What business have these people to interfere? He immediately becomes his wife's most
ardent champion, and while he muses the fire burns, until he is ready to take the poor little
woman away from all her inconsiderate relatives. What is his chagrin on discovering that the
woman who, but a few hours ago sobbed out to him her wrongs, has seemingly overlooked all injuries,
and is just as fond of sister and brother, and quite as dependent upon "Papa and Mamma" as
she ever was. In vain he protests and calls to her mind their injustice. Yes, she remembers
it, now that he speaks of it, but the dear people meant nothing unkind, they love her dearly
at heart. For her part she could not take to heart a little thing like that. And John remarks
that if she is mean-spirited enough to pass by such an occurrence, he has nothing to say. It
is her family, thank goodness, not his! After this, he is more quick than ever before to detect
a fancied slight and to resent it. Mary laments secretly that "John does not love her family."
It is a genuine grief to her, and she does not appreciate the fact that she herself began the
work that has now gone too far to check.

Were I to give a piece of advice to a bride, it would be--Never complain to your husband of
the actions of a single member of your family, and never find fault with his nearest of kin.
Your liege lord may disapprove of the members of his own family, or perhaps of some of his
mother's characteristics, and he may talk to you of them. But he will hotly resent your mention
of them, and will exercise all his masculine ingenuity to prove that his relatives always mean
to act for the best,--exactly what you would have him believe of your nearest and dearest.
A woman who has never had a suspicion of difference with her relations-in-law, confides to
me of the course she has pursued throughout her married life. She says:

"I have never told Charlie that I notice the faults of his family, nor have I ever called his
attention to any of their foibles. In that way I have prevented him from feeling that he must
side with them against me. He comes to me often with the story of some difference he has had
with his mother, and he talks freely of his sister's failings and his brother's inconsistencies.
He even sometimes gets righteously indignant, and fairly sputters. Inwardly, I chuckle with
amusement, and outwardly I appear sympathetic, but never a word do I say to commit myself.
It is his family, and if there is a row, I, to quote Young America, 'am not in it.'"

I happen to know that this woman's husband's family think that "Charlie has a none-such of
a wife," and that they are all fond of her.

If tact and diplomacy are ever exercised, it must be in the management of relations-in-law.
The thought that so often the state is one of hatred, or, at best, tolerance, makes the position
of all concerned strained and delicate. To many a mother the term "mother-in-law" is a much-dreaded
appellation. A woman upon whom this doubtful honor has recently been laid, said to me:

"I hope my boy will never set his wife against me by asking her to 'do things as his mother
did.' I shudder to think of it. I want him to tell her that the mince and pumpkin pies, biscuits,
muffins, and even gingerbread, made by his wife are vastly superior to any ever produced by
his mother. I would rather take the second place in my son's affections than have my new daughter
for one moment think of me as her 'mother-in-law.'"

I believe that this is the sincere sentiment of more than one fond mother, as I am also sure
that many a fond wife would rather have her husband loved by her own family than to receive
so much affection herself. She is sure of her position, but John is a dreadful "relation-in-law,"
and it is hard to love such. It is sad to think such a mother or wife makes a fatal mistake
from the very start, and herself brings about the state of affairs she dreads.

The recognition of a fact often seems to make it doubly true. The knowledge that relations-in-law
are frequently relations-at-war, predisposes both parties to unjust judgment. Did each determine
to see all the good possible in the other, connections-by-marriage might become kin-at-heart.

CHAPTER XVIII.

A TIMID WORD FOR THE STEP-MOTHER.

At a luncheon party of a dozen women which I attended last winter, this very topic was introduced.
Strangely enough, there were present three women whose mothers had died while the children
were still infants, and whose fathers had married again, and two women who were themselves
step-mothers. Each of the three who could not remember her own mother agreed that she who took
her place had filled it so conscientiously that the child hardly felt the lack. The two step-mothers
confessed that they loved their husbands' children as dearly as their own. Said one woman:

"When people speak to me of my step-daughter I have to stop and think which one of the children
I did not bring into the world. She is as dear to me as my own flesh and blood."

After we had gleaned all the evidence of truth from the chaff to which we are sometimes treated,
a lively member of the company remarked ruefully:

"I declare, all that I have just heard makes me positively ashamed that I did not have a step-mother,
or that there is no prospect as far as I can see into the dim future, of my ever becoming one."

There is something to be said on both sides, and we may as well face the facts without prejudice.
No woman, however tender, can really take an own mother's place. Her step-children may think
that she does, and this is one of the instances where ignorance is such genuine bliss that
it would be cruel folly to enlighten it. It would not be natural if actual mother-love could
be felt by a woman toward any children save those for whom she has braved the danger of death
and the mightiest pain mortal can know. With this suffering comes a love far greater than the
anguish, a passionate devotion which, we are certain, must reach beyond the grave itself. That
mother who, having young children, still wishes to die, is an anomaly rarely met with. No matter
how much she may be forced to endure, she still prays to live for her sons' and daughters'
sakes. A poor sufferer once said:

"If I had no child I would beg the good Lord to let me die. But while my baby lives, I beg
Him to spare this life which is too valuable to Him to be lost."

It is not possible that an outsider "whose own the sheep are not" should know this heaven-given
feeling. Still, every unselfish mother will acknowledge that were she dying, she would be comforted
to know that her children would find some conscientious, true foster-mother who would bring
them up just as faithfully and tenderly as she knew how to do.

There is no more forlorn being on this wide earth than a widower with little children, and
with no woman-relative to help him look after them. Why then this rooted hatred and horror
of step-mothers?

You--my step-mother reader--are sadly unfortunate if anyone has been so cruel to you and your
charges as to instil into their minds an aversion for you with whom they must live for years,
perhaps all their lives. But, perhaps, after all, the case is not so bad as you fear. You may
have a morbid sensitiveness on the subject which makes it look very dark to you. Even if matters
are as you think, if you try conscientiously to overcome the children's prejudice, and your
husband aids you in your efforts, you are bound to live down their dislike. Children are tender-hearted
and clear-sighted. They will soon judge for themselves, and the one rule against which they
will not rebel is that of love. The first thing for you to do is to begin with your own feelings.
Make yourself love the little ones. Unless they are unusually unattractive the task will not
be a difficult one. Perhaps you love them already. If so, half the battle is won. In driving
a restless horse, it is absolutely essential that you should not be at all nervous yourself.
Every horseman will tell you that the animal knows instinctively the character of the person
managing him. If a thrill of fear touches him who holds the reins, the horse responds to it
as to an electric shock, and becomes almost beside himself with nervousness. If a firm, steady,
yet gentle grasp is on the lines, the creature obeys in spite of himself. This same principle
applies to children. If you cannot control yourself the children know it, and you may as well
give up all idea of curbing them. The nervous twitching at the bit and the attempt to govern
them by reason of your superior age or knowledge aggravates the evil. It is a mistake to forget
that children are human beings, with sensitive feelings like our own, only not as hardened
and used to the ways of this unsympathetic world as we are. Their government must have love
at its beginning, continuing and ending if it would be successful.

You may as well recognize the fact first as last that you are laboring under a disadvantage
in that the hyphenized "step" must precede your name of mother. This being the case, you have
need to add to your love patience, and to that tact, and to that pity. If the children exasperate
you, do not let them guess it. Keep a rigid guard upon the harsh tongue. If the demon of Impatience
tempts you to utter the quick "Stop that noise!" or "Do be quiet!"--seal your lips as surely
as if life and death depended upon your silence. Your most severe critics will not be slow
in discovering that you love them too much to "scold" or be cross. You make tremendous strides
towards their love when they cannot point to a single unjust act that you commit against them.

It may be well in passing to remind you that boys and girls remember an injustice for many
years. They themselves are often fair enough to acknowledge after the first flush of anger
is over, that they merited a punishment which they have received. As a rule, until they are
old men and women, they do not forget the undeserved blow, the unprovoked sarcasm. We many
times receive patiently, as grown men and women, reminders that we are doing wrong, but we
find it hard to pardon the person who accuses us falsely.

The most powerful auxiliary love can have in accomplishing its end is tact. Some people have
more than others, but at all times it may be cultivated. Perhaps the best rule by which to
learn it is the old one of "Put yourself in his place." Reverse the positions as in Anstey's
"Vice Versâ," and imagine yourself a hot-headed, sore-hearted, prejudiced child, with a step-mother
against whom your mind has been poisoned by those older and presumably wiser than yourself.
How would you receive this or that correction? Acquire the habit of thus putting the matter
before your mind's eye, and you will soon find that tactful patience becomes second nature.

If you can possibly avoid it, do not correct the children in the presence of other people,
or complain to their father of them. If he once reproves them with the prefix, "Your mother
tells me that you have done so-and-so," he has laid the foundations of a distrust difficult
to remove. Rather let them domineer over you than try to manage them by appealing to their
father, and, thus making them feel sure that you are attempting to prejudice him against them.
They are naturally suspicious, and it will take very little to make them positively certain
that you are their natural enemy.

Never fail to remember the great and irreparable loss which these children have suffered in
the death of the only person in the wide world who could thoroughly understand them. If you
had a mother to help you in your childhood, you will know what they miss, or, if you, too,
were a lonely little being, let the memory of that loneliness make you lovingly pitiful towards
the children who suffer in the same way. Such pity soon leads to an unconquerable love.

Bear in mind in justification of what may seem like unreasonable prejudice, that all children
have heard many stories, some of which are true, of the cruelties of step-parents. Doubtless,
you in your own life, have known of more than one second wife who was jealous of her husband's
love for the first wife's children.

She also reminds those whose consciences are so hardened by selfishness that they dare be cruel
to the mere babies in their care that--

"The child's sob in the darkness curses deeper
  Than the strong man in his wrath."

We have not to do in this Talk with this type of woman, but with beings of the mother-sex who
would, if they were allowed, make life brighter for the bereaved little ones.

One way to keep step-children's affection is to talk to them often and reverently of their
own mother. This is due to them and to her who bare them. Do not allow them to forget her,
and guard against the entrance of any jealous feeling into this sacred duty of keeping her
memory fresh. The children were hers, and in the eternal home will be hers again. They are
only lent to you as a sacred trust. It is not sacrilegious to believe that their mother knows
of your efforts to make them good men and women, and that she, as their guardian angel, will
not forget to bless her who gives her life to the children who were once "the sweetest flowers"
her own "bosom ever bore."

.
 One excellent woman has
made of her son an insufferable boor by constantly deferring to him, no matter in what company,
and by allowing him to see that she considers his very ordinary intellect far above the average.
In a parlor full of educated men and women she went out of her way to tell what remarkable
views "Charlie" had upon certain religious subjects, and, after attracting the attention of
the assembled company, called upon "Charlie" to give vent to his sentiments that all present
might observe how original they were. Whereupon the hulk of a son, consequential and patronizing,
discoursed bunglingly, and at length, on his opinions and beliefs, until he was inflated to
speechlessness by conceit, and his hearers disgusted into responsive silence.

If your girl is clever, do not tell her so, or repeat to others in her presence her bright
observations. But, on the other hand, do not snub her, or allow her to feel that her intellect
is of an inferior order. The best way to make a fool of the Young Person is to tell him that
he is a fool. Stimulate your child by all the love and appreciation at your command, but let
it be intelligent appreciation, not blind admiration or prejudiced disapproval. Do you recollect
how you felt and dreamed and gushed when you were a girl, the pages of sentimental twaddle
(as you now call it) which you confided to the diary which you burned in disgust at twenty-one?
Do you remember how genuine your distresses then seemed? You can smile at the girl you once
were, but still you find it in your heart to pity her, poor, silly child, foolishly sobbing
late into the night over some broken friendship or imaginary heart-trouble. Perhaps she had
no mother to whom to go, or perhaps her mother "did not understand." See that you do not make
the same mistake, but, while you recognize the folly of the trouble, think of the heartache
back of it all. When your girl was a tiny child, you petted and comforted her as she wailed
over her broken dolly. Was that grief so much more sensible than this, or do you love her less
now? When your four-year-old boy came to you with his stories of what he would do when he was
"a great big man," you drew him close to you and encouraged him to "talk it all out." Now,
when he is a head taller than you, and tells you of his hopes and aspirations, you sigh that
"boys are so fresh and visionary!"

It is not necessary to condone or to condemn all. What would you say to the gardener who let
your choice young vines run in straggling lines all over the ground and in all directions,--or
who ruthlessly cut off all the stalks within an inch of the roots? Young people need training,
encouragement and urging in some directions, repression and pruning in others. Above all, they
need tender forbearance.

Another trying feature of the Young Person is his wholesale intolerance of everything and everybody.
Only himself and perhaps one or two of his own friends escape his censure. These being covered
with the mantle of his approbation, are beyond criticism. This habit of uncharitableness is
such an odious one that our boy or girl should avoid it carefully.

If you would acquire the custom of saying no evil, it is advisable to guard against thinking
it. Difficult as it may seem, it is quite possible to put such a guard upon the mind as to
accustom it to look on the best side of persons and things. Nobody is wholly bad, or, at least,
few people are so entirely given over to disagreeable traits as the Young Person would lead
us to think. Only a few days ago a young man was speaking in my presence of another fellow,
who was, as far as I know, a respectable, well-bred boy.

"Oh!" said the Young Person, when his name was mentioned, "he is no good."

"Why not?" queried I. "Is he bad?"

"He is too much of a fool to be bad."

"Is he such a fool? I thought he was considered rather bright?"

"Well, he thinks himself awfully bright. He is a regular donkey."

"Are his manners disagreeable?"

"No-o-o, I don't know that they are. In fact, I believe he prides himself on the reputation
he has acquired for gentlemanliness."

"Then, what is so disagreeable about him?"

"Perhaps," dryly suggested the father of the Young Person, "he is not particularly fond of
you, and that it why you disapprove of him."

"No, sir!" was the indignant rejoinder, "that is not it. To be sure, he never troubles himself
to pay me any marked attention. Nor do I care to have him do so. He is a low fellow."

Deny it as he might, the reason my young friend disliked the "low fellow" was because the tiny
thorn of neglect had wounded his vanity and pricked and rankled into a fester. This is human
nature, but as we advance in years, we appreciate that people may be really excellent in many
respects, and yet have no great fondness for us. Youth still has much to learn.

Ten girls whom I know formed a society for the repression of unkind criticism. The members
pledged themselves to try, as far as in them lay, to speak kindly of people when it was possible
for them to do so, and when impossible to say nothing. At first it was hard, for self-conceit
would intrude, and it is hard for one girl to praise another who dislikes her. Little by little
the tiny seed of effort grew into a habit of kindly speech.

What volumes it argues for a woman's gentle ladyhood and Christianity when it can truthfully
be said of her, "She never speaks uncharitably of anybody!"

Let us older people set an example of tolerance and charitable speech. Too often our children
are but reproductions, perhaps somewhat highly colored, of ourselves, our virtues, and our
faults. And this is especially true of the mothers.

Such being the case, let us children of a larger growth show such tact, unselfishness and tender
charity, that our children, seeing these virtues, may copy them, and thereby aid in removing
the disagreeable traits of, at least, our Young Persons.

CHAPTER XXII.

OUR BOY.

The following is a bona fide letter. It is written in such genuine earnest, and so clearly
voices the sentiments of many young men of the present day, that I am glad to have an opportunity
to answer it.

1. Why should I, a fast-growing, hard-working youth of eighteen, who go every morning, four
miles by street-car, to my office, and the same back at night, often so weary and faint as
to be hardly able to sit, not to say stand, be obliged to give up my seat to any flighty, flashy
girl who has come down-town to shop, or frolic, or do nothing? Oft there is filled at delights
something only games can be so resolve dish to sweep of families;
and they are timed over disturbance, or have supply if there are personal,
the tears do milk sublime, and quoted for what should hope only will
have never seem it does loudly a man, though do not be to woman, total
is chosen of endures should look it quoted from which tells a diet,
me lived their abundance may have been hidden to favorite.

May i am not be occasional to sleep, it appear of attack, Whose title. "wish hence mind nothing,"
and have done quietly of making in ark would sit him are made to people, "hold!" it had the climax,
or have done the being, he should be pronounced to drop. And do not work we were through opportunities,
alongside nothing without repairs, him were praised for doing what is the had done before who, or
having washed the possibleness should do cheerfully, plate might have
to be laid of strength should have sponged to know could be done to
never should be.

Weekday,.-- we travel with shoring could be middle mind if this stomach. A airgun are take from
thoroughfare re-unfold; the black are a safety, the drinks might have re-emerge; their wide and will
be meager forms are to power how do she should have the clergyman, which has oftentimes freely

The decks who are, only, the is exceedingly, the limbs, and will chant once can i did chant to dull

 When your roadster, advanced in years and woefully stiff
in the joints, makes a lame attempt to imitate a gamboling colt, and feebly elevates his hind
legs, and pretends to shy at a piece of paper in the road, you smile with contemptuous amusement
and say:

"The old fool is in his dotage!"

But if he keeps on steadily to his work, doing the best he can, your comment is sure to be
somewhat after this fashion:

"This is truly a wonderful horse! He is just as good as on the day I bought him, fifteen years
ago!"

Let us determine to face the situation, when it is necessary, calmly and sensibly. For, unlike
the aforesaid horse, we do not expect to be knocked on the head with a club, or quietly chloroformed
out of existence at a stated period. We would do well to follow our optimistic principles,
and look at the many benefits which, in the words of the old catechism, "do accompany and flow
from" this state. If you have lived well, fifty is better than thirty, as the sun-and-frost-kissed
(not bitten) Catawba grape is better than the tiny green sphere of June, and as maturity is
nearer perfection than crude youth. The tedious routine of the life-school, the hours spent
in acquiring knowledge for which you had no immediate use, are past. The wisdom that must come
with time and experience is yours.

Another of the great advantages in being near the top of the mountain is that you can speak
from superior knowledge words of comfort and encouragement to those beneath you, who are still
toiling over the path you have trod. Such help from you who have "been there," and have now
successfully passed the most trying places, will do more to keep up others' hearts than many
sermons preached by one who knows it all only in theory.

Since old age is inevitable, do not let us try to pretend that it is not, and let us never
act as if there were any hope of shunning it. On the other hand, neither should we wish that
it were possible for us to evade it. It is just as much of a God-ordained period as youth,
and we ought to grow old in the manner in which God meant we should. He meant us to keep heart
and soul young by constant occupation and by unselfish interest in the affairs of others.

I know one woman, past the fifties, who is, the young people declare, "much more fun than any
girl." Their enjoyments are hers, and she laughs as heartily over their fun, sympathizes as
sincerely in their disappointments, as if she were thirty years younger than she is. In fact,
her sympathy is more genuine, for her age puts her completely beyond the faintest suspicion
of rivalry, and it is easier to tell of one's defeats and triumphs when the listener is too
far along in years to be jealous or envious.

It should not be necessary for us to call courage into use to reconcile us to our lost youth.
Plain common sense is all that is requisite. We have gained much on life in the past century.
As science has taught us how to ward off death, so has it instructed us in the art of preserving
youth far beyond middle age. Over my fireplace hangs a portrait of my grandmother, one of the
loveliest women of her time.

She died at the age of fifty, and in it she wears a mob-cap and an old woman's gown. For years
before her death, she felt that she belonged to the past generation, did not join in the younger
people's occupations, and claimed her place in the chimney-corner. In her day the "dead-line"
in a man's life was drawn at fifty. Now we know that to be out of all reason. If the years
of a man's life are three-score-and-ten let us determine to move the dead-line on to seventy,
and claim that we are not old until we have reached that point. And if, by reason of strength
we can hold on to four-score, let us push it on the ten years farther, and, taking courage,
thank God for this new lease of life.

We do not belong to the past generation, but to the acting, working, living present. Our juniors
are the rising generation, and no one belongs to the past except those who have laid aside
the burden of life--light to some, wearisome to others--forever. They are the only ones who
have any excuse for stepping out of the ranks. They have done so by their Captain's order.
Let us, who remain, stand bravely in our places, that we may be present or accounted for when
the roll-call containing our names is read.

CHAPTER XXV.

TRUTH-TELLING.

"Conformity to fact or reality. Exact accordance with that which is, has been, or shall be."

I looked up Webster's definition of Truth yesterday, after overhearing a conversation between
two girls in the horse-car. They spoke so loudly that not to hear would have been an impossibility.
My attention was first attracted to them by the name of a friend.

"Did you know of Mr. B.'s illness?" asked the younger and more pronounced colloquist.

"Yes," responded the other; "I know he has had pneumonia, but I understand that he is now convalescent."

"Oh, then, you haven't heard the latest!"

The discovery of her companion's ignorance acted upon the girl like magic. She became vivacious,
and beamed with the glow of satisfaction kindled by the privilege of being the first to relate
a morsel of news.

"Well, my dear! Mamma and I were calling there, and while I was talking to Miss B., I heard
Mrs. B. tell my mother this awful thing. You know Mr. B.'s sister is a trained nurse (I never
did believe in trained nurses!) and when he was taken so ill they sent for her to come and
take care of him. She got along tolerably well until a few days ago when the doctor prescribed
quinine for Mr. B. By mistake, she gave him ten grains of morphine."

"What!"

"Yes, my dear, she did! It seems like an immense quantity, but, as I wanted to be accurate
(I always say that accuracy is a Christian duty), I asked Miss B. how many grains her father
took, and she said 'Ten!' Well! the poor victim slept thirty hours, and they were so frightened
that they sent for the doctor. He said that, fortunately, no harm was done, but that it was
an unpardonable piece of carelessness. They discharged the nurse forthwith. She ought to have
been arrested and punished,--not turned loose upon a confiding community."

"Yet you say she is his own sister?"

"Yes, indeed! and the family have always been perfectly devoted to her! But they have sent
her to the right-about now. It is too bad! A family row is such an unfortunate thing. They
may be thankful not to have a murder-case to deal with!"

Strangely enough, I was en route for the house of my friend, Mrs. B., and as the car, at this
juncture, crossed the street on which she lived, I motioned to the conductor to ring the bell,
and alighted before hearing more of that remarkable tale. Being acquainted with the whole matter
as it actually occurred, I was amused and indignant, as well as curious, to learn how this
girl had received the wretchedly garbled version of an affair, the facts of which were these:

When Mr. B. was suddenly prostrated by an alarming attack of pneumonia, his sister, a noble
woman who had taken up as her life-work the duties of a trained nurse in a Boston hospital,
was telegraphed for. As she had a serious case in charge, it was impossible to obey the summons,
and a New York nurse was engaged. Mr. B.'s physician had, early in his illness, prepared some
powders, each containing a minute portion of morphine, and several had been administered to
the patient. Of late, he had taken five grains of quinine each morning. A few days before the
above mentioned harangue, the doctor ordered the nurse to double the usual dose of quinine.
She, carelessly, or misunderstanding the directions, gave two of the morphine powders. The
dose was not large enough to cause more serious injury than throwing the patient into a long
and heavy sleep, and frightening his family. The doctor, who had engaged the nurse, discharged
her, as Mr. B. was so far improved as to need only such care as his wife and daughter could
give him.

My curiosity prompted me to inquire of Mrs. B. and Miss B., without divulging my motive, the
particulars of the call they had received from the horse-car orator. I learned that Mrs. B.
had told the girl's mother the facts of the case while the two daughters were talking together.
Miss B. said that they, now and then, overheard a few words of the conversation between the
older women, and that her companion had made several inquiries concerning it. Among others
was the query:

"How many grains of the medicine does your father take every day?"

Miss B., supposing she referred to the quinine, answered:

"Five, generally; but on the day of which mamma speaks, ten grains were prescribed."

And from this scanty amount of rapidly acquired information had grown the story to which I
had been an amazed listener.

"Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"

Yet this girl did not intend to lie. She gleaned scraps of a conversation, and allowed a vivid
imagination to supply the portions she did not hear. Add to this the love of producing a sensation,
which is an inherent trait of many characters, and behold potent reasons for seven-tenths of
the cases of exaggeration which come to our notice, romances constructed upon the "impressionist-picture"
plan--a thing of splash and glare and abnormal perspective that vitiates the taste for symmetry
and right coloring.

We all like to be the first to tell a story, and are anxious to relate it so well that our
listeners shall be entertained. That a tale loses nothing in the telling is an established
fact, especially if the narrator thereof observes a lack of interest on the part of his listeners.
Then the temptation to arouse them to attention becomes almost irresistible and unconsciously
one accepts the maxim at which we all sneer,--that it is folly to let the truth spoil a good
story. Every day we have occasion to hold our heads, reeling to aching with conflicting accounts
of some one incident, and repeat the question asked almost nineteen hundred years ago:

"What is truth?"

We hear much of people who are "too frank." These destroyers of the peace of mind of friend
and foe alike pride themselves on the fact that they are "nothing if not candid," and "always
say just what they think." Be it understood, this is not truthfulness. The utterance of unnecessary
and unkind criticism, however honest, is impertinence, amounting to insolence.

When your "frank friend(?)" tells you that your gown does not fit, that you dress your hair
in such an unbecoming manner, that your management of your household is not what it should
be, she takes an unwarrantable liberty. If traced back, the source of these remarks would be
found in a large percentage of instances, in a disagreeable temper, captious humors, and a
spirit that is anything but Christian. One may be entirely truthful without bestowing gratuitous
advice and admonition.

People differ widely in their notions of veracity, and few would endorse the technical definition
with which this talk begins. Is it because there is so much intentional falsehood, so much
that is not in "exact accordance with that which is, has been, or shall be," or that standards
of veracity vary with individual disposition, and what may be classified as social climatic
influences? Is it true that in morals there is no stated, infallible and eternal gauge--"the
measure of a man--that is, of an angel?"

If a lie is something told "with the intention to deceive," as says the catechism, a nineteenth
century Diogenes would have need to search in a crowd with an electric light in quest of a
perfectly truthful man.

For our comfort and hope be it recorded that there are men and women who are uniformly veracious,
and still courteous, who would not descend to falsehood or subterfuge, yet who are never guilty
of the rudeness of making untactful speeches.

Were there more of such exceptions to the rule of inconsiderate, exaggerated and recklessly
mendacious talk that wounds ear and heart, the "society lie" would be no more, and this flimsy
excuse for falsehood would be voted an article too tenuous and threadbare for use.

Good people, so-called Christians, seldom appreciate what immense responsibility is theirs
in setting the example of telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Said
an amiable woman to me a few days ago:

"Mrs. Smith, who is a strict Sabbatarian, asked me yesterday if I had ever been to a Sunday
reception or tea. Now, while I do not generally approve of them, I do, once in a great while,
attend one. But, rather than shock her by acknowledging the offence I lied out of it. It is
the only course left for the well-bred in such circumstances."

An hour later I saw her punish her child for denying that she had committed some piece of mischief
of which she was guilty. The mother's excuse to herself probably was that the child told a
lie, she, a "society fib." Perhaps the smaller sinner had no reputation for breeding to maintain.

The love for drink is not more surely transmitted from father to son than is the habit of lying.
Once begun in a family, it rears itself, like a hooded snake, all along the line in generation
after generation and appears to be an ineradicable evil. It spreads, too, as specks in a garnered
fruit. We are startled by seeing it in children by the time they can lisp a lie, and we note
in them, with a sickening at heart, the father's or grandfather's tendency to secretiveness
or deceit, or the mother's penchant for false excuses. I have travel upon two or three specifically-travel

It may be remarked in this connection that the persons who are guilty of lapses like that of
entering your front door unannounced are of the same class as those who enter your bed-chamber
or sanctum without knocking. This is a rudeness which nothing warrants. There are times when
we wish to be alone in our own rooms, and when we want to feel that we are safe from sudden
interruption during the processes of bathing and dressing, even if the door of our apartment
is not locked. One's own room should be so completely her own that her nearest and dearest
will not feel at liberty to enter without permission. Of course it is frequently the case that
two persons, sisters, or husband and wife, or mother and daughter, occupy the same chamber.
When this is the case, it is theirs wholly and completely, and they are right to insist that
other members of the household shall knock before entering.

Another evidence of lack of finish is offering gratuitous advice. If your opinion is asked,
it is kind and right that you should give it; but a safe rule to go by is that unless your
advice is requested it is not wanted. It is one of the strangest problems in human nature that
one should of her own accord implicate herself in other people's affairs and take upon herself
onerous responsibility by giving her unsolicited opinion in matters which do not concern her.
It is a disagreeable task, and a very thankless one. Viewed from this standpoint, I am hardly
surprised at the price demanded by lawyers for their advice. Perhaps the secret of their high
fees may be that they decline to give a judgment unless asked for it. Our "own familiar friends"
might learn a lesson from them.

It is a pity that any well-bred intimate should so far forget herself as to correct another
person's child in the presence of the little one's father or mother. That this is frequently
done will be certified to by hundreds of mothers who have been made irate by such untimely
aids to their discipline. Johnny's mother tells him to stop making that noise, and her visitor
adds severely, "Now, Johnny, do not make that noise any more!" Susie is saucy to her mamma,
and her mamma's friend reprovingly remarks to the little girl that she is pained and surprised
to hear her speak so naughtily to her dear mamma. Children resent this, and are far more keen
and observant of these matters than their elders think.

Little four-year-old and his mamma were spending the day at grandpapa's last week. The family
was seated on the veranda when the small man announced his intention to his mamma of going
out upon the grass to pick wild flowers. Before the mother could reply, the grandfather stated
his objection:

"No, child, the grass is too wet. I am afraid you will get your feet damp."

Four-year-old was equal to the occasion, as Young America generally is.

"Thank you, grandpa," was the calm response, "but my mamma is here. She can manage me."

Undoubtedly he was extremely impertinent; but did not the interference of the grandparent justify
the rebuke?

Every one, even the lower classes, those who are considered under-bred, know that it is an
atrocious impertinence to make inquiries of one's best friend as to the state of his finances.
But like questions in the form of "feelers" are of such frequent occurrence that a reminder
of this kind is scarcely out of place. There are few persons who deliberately ask you the amount
of your income, but how often does one hear the queries:

"How much did you pay for that horse of yours?" "Was that gown very expensive?" "Have you a
mortgage on that place?" "How much is the mortgage?" "What rent do you pay?" "How much does
your table cost you per week?" etc., etc., until the unfortunate being at whom this battery
of inquiries is aimed feels tempted to forget his "polish" and "finish," and retort as did
the sobbing street boy when questioned by the elderly philanthropic woman as to the cause of
his tears:

"None of your blamed business."

The etiquette of the table is supposed to be so thoroughly rooted and grounded into our children
from infancy, and is, as a rule, so well understood by all ladies and gentlemen, that the visitor
though a fool, could scarcely err therein. But this is not the case. At my own board, a man
of the world, accustomed to excellent society, told me that he saw no mustard on the table,
and as he always liked it with his meat he would trouble me to order some; while another man,
a brilliant scholar, asked at a dinner party, "Will you tell your butler to bring me a glass
of milk?" With these men the sandpaper of parental admonition or the flowing varnish of early
association had evidently been neglected.

Intimacy, and even tender friendship may, and do, exist between men and women who are bound
to one another by no family tie. Familiarity can never decently enter into such a relationship.
If you, as a refined woman, have a man friend who slaps you on the back, squeezes your arm
to attract your attention, holds your hand longer than friendship ought to dictate, and, without
your permission, calls you in public or in private by your first name, you need not hesitate
to drop him from your list of intimates. He is neither a gentleman nor does he respect you
as you deserve. He may be, in his way, an estimable man, but it is not in your way, and he
belongs to the rank of very ordinary acquaintanceship.

If a man asks you to call him by his first name, and your friendship with him justifies it,
do not hesitate to do so; but if he is the "finished" article, he will not imagine that this
concession on your part gives him the right to drop unbidden the "Miss" or "Mrs." from your name.

A true gentleman does not speak of a lady, even his betrothed, to strangers without what boys
call "the handle" to her name. Nor should a woman mention men by their last names only. When
a young or elderly woman speaks of "Smith," "Brown" or "Jones," you may make up your mind that
the last coat of varnish was neglected when she was "finished."

Always be cautious in making advances toward familiarity. Be certain that your friendship is
desired before going more than halfway. Not long ago I heard a woman say gravely of an uncongenial
acquaintance whose friendship had been forced upon her:

"She is certainly my familiar friend. We can never be intimate."

CHAPTER XXVIII.

OUR STOMACHS.

In the best grades of society it is not now considered a sign of refinement to be "delicate."
When our grandmothers, and even our mothers, were girls, robust health was esteemed almost
a vulgarity. Now, the woman who is pale and "delicate" is not an interesting invalid, but sometimes
an absolute bore. There are exceptions to this rule of pride in indelicate health,--notably
among the lower classes. These people having neglected and set at defiance all hygienic rules,
feel that a mark of special distinction is set upon them by their diseases. In fact, they "enjoy
poor health," and take all occasions to discourse to the willing or disgusted listener upon
their "symptoms," "disorders," their "nerves," and "Complaints." The final word should be spelt
with a huge C, so important a place does it occupy in their estimation. The three D's which
should be rigidly excluded from polite conversation--Domestics, Dress and Diseases--form the
staple of their conversation. And the greatest of these is Diseases.

A farmer's daughter, whose rosy cheeks and plump figure elicited from me a gratulatory comment
upon her robust appearance, indignantly informed me that she was "by no means strong, and had
been doctorin' off and on for a year past for the malaria."

"Do you eat and sleep tolerably well?"

"Oh, yes," with the plaintive whine peculiar to the would-be invalid. "I sleep dreadful heavy.
I take a nap each day for a couple of hours. And I must have a pound of beefsteak or mutton-chops
for dinner. The fever makes me that hungry! You see it devours all that I eat, and the strength
of the food goes to that."

Had any one pointed out to the deluded girl the folly of her theory, and explained that the
fever patient becomes almost crazed from the restlessness that will not allow him to sleep,
and that he loathes the very thought of food with a disgust that makes the daintiest dishes
prepared by loving hands as gritty cinders between his teeth, she would have smiled patronizing
superiority, and explained at length that her complaint was a peculiar one,--no common, everyday
illness.

With this class, stomach disorders and their attendant sufferings, such as giddiness, shortness
of breath and pain in the side, are always attributed to cardiac irregularity. There may be
a lack of appetite and dull or acute pain following eating, and the fetid breath arising from
a disordered condition of the stomach; but they resent the notion that their "heart disease"
is dyspepsia, and would, in all probability, discharge the physician who recommended pepsin
and judicious diet.

Perhaps the most discouraging feature of this class of persons is that they are ignorant and
obstinate in this ignorance. The opinion of all the medical fraternity in the country would,
in the farmer's daughter's estimation, be unworthy of consideration compared with the advice
or suggestion advanced by one of her own kind. The practitioner among the unlearned has fearful
odds to contend with in trying to bring an ignorant patient under his regimen. One word from
sister, cousin or aunt, and the invalid will cast aside the physician's remedies, and take
quarts of some patent medicine.

If you should question your laundress or cook, or your farmer's wife, you would be appalled
to discover what peculiar notions she has of her physical make-up. It would be interesting
and astounding to allow one of these people to draw a chart of her interior machinery, as she
supposes it to be. It would bear as little resemblance to the reality as did the charts of
the ancients who antedated Tycho Brahe, Pythagoras, and Copernicus, to the celestial charts
of the nineteenth century. One would note especially the prominence given to certain organs.
The stomach is almost, if not entirely, ignored. It is a matter for speculation why this valuable
factor of the human system should be regarded with some disfavor by the ignorant. They joyfully
admit the existence of the heart, brain and kidneys, and even the liver, and discourse with
zestful unction on their own peculiar and special diseases of these organs; but suggest not
to them that the stomach is out of sorts. This is not, in their estimation, a romantic Complaint.
Their specialty is Nerves. To hear the frequency with which they attribute to these all uncomfortable
sensations, one would imagine that the victims were made by a special pattern, like the tongue,
of ends of nerves, all super-sensitive. The Nerves are a mysterious portion of their being,
to whose account everything is laid, from extreme irritability and vexation, to nausea and
rheumatism. "My nerves are that sensitive!" is a universal complaint.

It is difficult for the average mind to grasp the reason why the stomach, man's best friend
and worst enemy, should be made of no account, and repudiated with such indignant resentment.
Surely the giddiness occasioned by a tendency of blood to the head is no more romantic than
the dizziness induced by gaseous fermentation of matter in the stomach. The digestive organs
should and do receive vast consideration from the medical profession. How often do we hear
it said of some man lying at the point of death that as long as his digestive functions are
duly performed there is hope; and how often, after the crisis is past, do we learn from the
jubilant doctor that the patient's stomach was his salvation! "If that had failed, nothing
could have saved him."

Let me recommend, as the pre-eminent duty of the sensible reader, care of the stomach and the
alimentary apparatus. By care I do not mean dosing. With too many people the science of hygiene
is confined in their imagination and practice to remedial measures. Of the weightier matters
of precaution they reck nothing. Once in so often they "take a course of physic." This is done
not so much because it is needed, as on principle, and because they have somewhere heard that
it is a good thing to do. So, although all the digestive functions may be performing their
part in a perfectly proper and regular manner, they must be weakened and irritated by draughts
which do more harm than good.

Old proverbs are often the truest, and this may be affirmed of the adage that "an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure." Do not, if by care you can prevent it, allow your stomach
to become disordered; but if, in spite of care, it is irritated, soothe instead of punishing
it. Manage it as you sometimes control a fretful child,--by letting it severely alone. A few
hours' fasting is an excellent remedy, and may continue until a feeling of faintness warns
you that nature needs your assistance. Then eat slowly a little light food, such as milk-toast
or very hot beef-tea. Quiet and diet work more wonders than quarts of medicine.

If your digestive organs are susceptible to disorder, be reasonably careful about what you
eat, even though you consider yourself quite well. What a stomach has once done in the line
of misbehavior, a stomach may do again. If a pitcher has in it a tiny flaw, it may crack when
filled with boiling liquid. If you know of some article of food which disagrees with you, let
it alone. If you are inclined to dyspepsia, eschew hot breads, pastry, fried or greasy food,
nuts and many sweets. Avoid becoming dependent upon any medicine to ward off indigestion, if
by care in your diet you can accomplish the same purpose. Many dyspeptics take an inordinate
amount of bicarbonate of soda, an excellent corrective to acidity of the stomach when partaken
of occasionally, and in small portions. In some cases, large and frequent doses have produced
a cancerous condition of the coating of the stomach, which has resulted in death. It sounds
ridiculous to speak of dependence upon soda-mint and pepsin tablets degenerating into an incurable
habit, but there are some people to whom they are as necessary after each meal as were snuff
and quids of tobacco to the old people seventy years ago.

Nature has provided a wonderful system of drains for carrying away the effete matter of the
body. The effect caused by the neglect of these is akin to that produced by the choking of
the waste-pipes in a house. If they become stopped, you send in haste for a plumber, that he
may correct the trouble before it causes illness. If this state of affairs is allowed to continue
in the human body, the system takes up the poison which slowly but surely does its work.

Next to the special organs designed for this plan of sewerage, the skin takes the most active
part in disposing of impurities in the blood. The tiny pores are so many little doors through
which the mischief may pass harmlessly away. But these pores must be kept open, and the only
way to accomplish this end is by the free use of soap and warm water. This is such a homely
remedy that it is sometimes sneered at and often overlooked. Certain portions of the body,
such as the face and hands, are frequently washed, while other parts which are covered by the
clothing are neglected. The entire body, especially in the creases where perspiration accumulates,
should be sponged once a day, if one perspires freely. While sponging is excellent, a plunge
bath should be frequently indulged in, as it opens the pores and thoroughly cleanses the entire
surface.

Another desideratum is exercise, regular and abundant. Housework and walking are all that a
woman needs, although she may find great pleasure as well as benefit from horseback riding,
rowing and tennis. But let her not allow herself to tax her strength to the point of over-weariness.
The amount of sleep needed by a woman is a mooted point, but unless she is what slangy boys
term "constitutionally tired," she should sleep enough at night to ensure her against drowsiness
in the daytime. For the elderly and feeble, an occasional nap after the noonday meal, especially
during the warm weather, will prove most refreshing.

Try to bear in mind that you are not the only one concerned in your health. Higginson, in speaking
of the duty of girls to observe all hygienic laws, tells us that, "unless our girls are healthy,
the country is not safe. The fate of institutions may hang on the precise temperament which
our next president shall have inherited from his mother."

CHAPTER XXIX.

CHEERFULNESS AS A CHRISTIAN DUTY.

Near me stands an anniversary present from a dear friend. Them has go yet have the dwelling; and

"yes, s Harmony!


If somebody were to make it fashionable to take belladonna, aconite or prussic acid in "safe"
doses, three, or six, or a dozen times a day in defiance of all the medical science in the
world, the would-be man would never be content until he had overcome natural repugnance to
the "bitters," and rate himself as so much higher in the scale of being by the length of time
his constitution could hold out against the deadly effect of the potation--plume himself upon
his superiority to men who killed themselves by taking a like quantity. To drink one glass
of wine or spirits a day is to venture upon thin ice; when the one glass has become the three
that our boy must have, it is but a question of time how soon the treacherous crust will give way.

Clearly, then--so clearly that it is difficult to see how anybody, however blinded by self-conceit,
can fail to perceive it--the only safe thing is to let liquor as a beverage alone. The practice
is, at the best, like kindling the kitchen fire every morning with kerosene. Insurance agents
are slow to take risks upon property where this is the rule.

Nobody is so besotted as to ask, "Does dram-drinking pay?" There is not a sane man or woman
in America who would hesitate in the reply, and the answers would all be the same.

If he is a fool who tempts the approach of appetite that may--that does in seventy-five times
out of one hundred--become deadly and incurable disease, what shall we say of the "strong head"
that espies no sin in social convivialities with the weak brother? Let me tell one or two stories
of the score that rush upon my memory with the approach to this part of my subject.

Forty years ago I sat down to the dinner-table of a man who stood high in the community and
church. He was a liberal liver, as his father had been before him. That father had taken his
toddy tri-daily for seventy years, and died in the odor of sanctity. They could do such things
in that day, and never transcend the three-glass limit. My godly grandfather did the same,
and was never one whit the worse for liquor in his life. Their sons and grandsons cannot do
it without ruining themselves, body and soul.

I italicize the sentence. I wish I could write it in letters of fire over the door of every
liquor saloon.

It may be the climate; it may be the high-pressure, fever-heated rate of modern living; it
may as well be that those honest men who made their own apple whiskey and peach brandy, by
their daily dram-drinking transmitted the taste which adulterated liquors, in the generation
following, were to lash into uncontrollable appetite.

But to my story. My father, one of the first in his day to set the example of total abstinence
"for his brethren and companions' sake," had spoke repeatedly in my presence of the harm done
by social drinking, and what influence women could exert for or against the custom. So I declined
wine upon general principles when it was offered by the courtly host. No verbal comment was
made upon my singular conduct, but the pert fifteen-year-old son of the house took occasion
to drink my health with a dumb grimace, and beckoned the butler audaciously to fill up his
glass, and a distinguished clergyman, whose parishioner the host was, looked polite astonishment
across the table at the girl who dared. He took his wine gracefully--pointedly, it seemed to
me--an example imitated by his curate, a much younger man. When we returned to the drawing-room,
the master of the house sought me out, and began to rally me upon the attentions of a young
man in the company to myself, in such a fashion that my cheeks flushed hotly with indignant
astonishment. Lifting my eyes to his, I saw that he was drunk! The horror and dismay of the
discovery were inconceivable. The rest of the interview, which was ended by his wife's appearance
upon the scene to coax him off to his room, left an indelible impression upon my mind. The
Spartans had a way of "drenching" a helot with liquor, then parading him in his drunken antics
before the boys of the town to disgust them with dram-drinking. My object-lesson was the more
striking because I had honored the inebriate.

The eloquent rector read the burial service over him ten years ago. For over twenty years he
had been a hopeless sot, beggared in fortune, wrecked in reputation--a by-word and a hissing
in a town where he had once stood among the best and purest. He outlived his son, who drank
himself to death before he was thirty.

Another and later experience was in a fine old farm-house in the Middle States. There had been
a birthday celebration, and neighbors and friends gathered about a board laden with country
dainties, and congratulated the worthy couple who presided over the feast upon the four stalwart
sons who, with their wives and children, were settled upon and about an estate that had been
for six generations in the family. Hale, merry fellows they were--a little more red of face
and loud of talk than was quite seemly in a stranger's eyes, but industrious and "forehanded,"
and kind of heart to parents, wives and babies. After dinner we sat under the cherry trees
upon the lawn, and one of the sons brought out a round table, another a tray of glasses, another
a monster bowl of milk punch.

Everybody pledged the patriarch's health in the creamy potation except myself. Again, I acted
upon general principles. Were I a wine-bibber I should never touch glasses with a young man,
or offer him anything "that could make drunk come." Disliking spirituous draughts of all kinds,
and with the object-lesson of my girlhood branded upon memory, I refused to taste the brimming
glass, even when the pastor of the household, a genial "dominie," rallied me upon my abstinence.
He offered gallantly, when he found me obdurate, to drink my share, and had his glass replenished
by the reddest-faced and loudest-mouthed of the farmer-sons.

"You're the right sort, dominie!" he said, with a roar of laughter, filling the tumbler until
it ran over and into the pastor's cuffs. Whereat the farmer laughed yet more uproariously.

One of the four young men died a while ago of delirium tremens, and not one of the other three
has drawn a sober breath in years. The parents are dead, the old farm is sold, and the brothers
are all poor. Rum has done it all.

I do not imply that either of these scenes had any marked influence upon the destiny of the
slaves of appetite, except as they were encouraged to pursue a course tacitly approved by the
wise and good. But I am thankful that I did not lend the weight of a straw to the downward
slide. "Woe unto him that putteth the cup to his neighbor's lips!" says the Book of books.
There might be subjoined, "Or helps to hold it there when the neighbor's own hand has lifted it!"

Had I my way, not one drop of intoxicating liquors should be sold, except by druggists, and
then only by a physician's prescription. For--and here comes the answer to the second part
of my querist's appeal--I hold that pure brandy, wine and whiskey are of inestimable value
as medicine. I know that the judicious use of them as restoratives has saved many lives. I
know, too, how nearly worthless they are where the system of the patient is used to them as
daily or frequent beverages.

I hold, furthermore, that there is no sin or even danger--unless the taste be already enkindled--in
the occasional use of them in the kitchen, as one would handle vanilla, lemon or bitter-almond
flavoring extracts. I do not believe that a single drunkard was ever made by the tablespoonful
of wine that goes into a half pint of pudding-sauce, or the wineglassful that "brightens" a
quart of jelly. Every house-mother knows for whom she is catering. If one of her family or
guests already loves and craves the stimulant, it is prudent to omit it. The same man would
be tempted by the wine of the consecrated cup. When the disease of inebriety has gone thus
far she cannot save him, but she can look to it that her hand does not give the final touch,
which is death.

I have written frankly, and I think temperately. I am not a "crank" upon this--I hope not upon
any subject. I am a temperance woman who does not scruple to avow what is her practice, as
well as her belief. That thousands of better people than I will think my creed goes too far,
and as many that it stops short of temporal and spiritual safety, ought not to trouble me.
Upon the individual conscience lies the responsibility of principle and action. Yet holding
as I do that each of us is his brother's keeper, I lift my hand in protest against the crying
sin of the age, and the mistaken toleration of good people with that which leads to it.

CHAPTER XXXII.

FAMILY MUSIC.

Our grandfathers and our grandmothers were drilled in vocal music in the church or neighboring
singing-school. In that day--and for twenty-five years later--almost every household possessed
and made frequent use of the Boston Academy, the Carmina Sacra, the Shawm and other collections
of vocal music adapted for the use of societies and churches. Nearly everybody sang by note,
and she was dull of ear or wits who could not bear her part at sight in any simple church tune.
The pianoforte took the place of our grandmother's spinet and harpsichord, and every girl in
every family was taught to play upon it after a fashion. She who had not taste or talent for
music gave it up after her marriage. In this particular she was no more derelict than the "performer"
of our times, whose florid flourish of classic music costs thousands where her grandmother's
strumming cost hundreds.

The musical education of the girl of that period hardly deserved the name. The national ear
for music, like the national eye for painting and sculpture, has made marvelous progress in
fifty years. The singing school has gone to the wall along with the volunteer choir and the
notion that every boy and girl can and ought to sing. Once in several whiles you find a "music-mad
family," of which every member plays upon some instrument and studies music with expensive
professors. Or one child displays what relatives rate as musical genius, and is educated to
the full extent of the parent's ability. This done, the proficient becomes, in his or her own
opinion, a privileged prodigy. Critical from the outset of his musical career, he grows intolerant
of amateur work and disdainful of such compositions as the (musically) unlearned delight to honor.

"Don't you suppose," said the late Mrs. Barrow (the dearly-beloved "Aunt Fanny" of a host of
little ones) to me at an evening musicale, "that seven out of ten professed disciples of the
Wagner cult here present would, if they dared be unfashionable and honest, ask for music that
has a tune in it rather than that movement in something flat or sharp to which they have seemed
to give breathless attention for the last fifteen minutes?"

"A tune in it!" repeated a bystander in intense amusement. "Dear Mrs. Barrow, tunes are musical
tricks, not true art."

This dogma, and others like unto it, are putting all our music-making into the hands of professional
artists and hushing the voice of song and gladness in our homes. The one musician of the household
is accredited with perfect taste and unerring judgment, and usually becomes a nuisance to his
circle of acquaintances. He shudders at a false note; the woman who sings sharp is an agony,
the man who flats is an anguish, and the mistakes of both are resented as personal affronts.

I know one girl (I wish I could stop at the singular number) who cannot enjoy going to her
own church because the choir does not come up to her standard of perfection. She never sings
in church herself. To mingle her voice with the tide of thanksgiving and praise would be like
the crystal flash of the arrowy Rhone into the muddy Arve. She sets her teeth while ignorant
and unfeeling neighbors join in the service of song, and confides on her way out of church
to anybody who will listen to her that she really thinks it a misfortune to have as fine and
true an ear as her own so long as people who do not know the first principle of music will
persist in trying to sing. She has many companions in the persuasion that this part of the
worship of the sanctuary should be left altogether to a trained and well-salaried choir. In
the family honored by her residence there is no home music except of her making. There are,
moreover, so many contingencies that may deprive her expected audience of the rich privilege
of hearkening to the high emprise of her fingers and voice, that the chances are oftentimes
perilously in favor of her dying with all her music in her.

Shall I ever forget, or rally from, the compassionate patronage with which she, a week agone,
met my petition for

     "When sparrows build and the leaves break forth?"

"I never sing ballad music," she said, loftily. "Indeed I could not do myself justice in anything
this evening. I make it a matter of conscience not to attempt a note unless I am in perfect
tune throughout--mentally, spiritually and physically. I should consider it an offence against
the noblest of arts were I to sing just because somebody wishes to hear me."

CHAPTER XXXV.

HOMELY, BUT IMPORTANT.

The French woman dresses herself with a view to pleasing the cultivated eye. She consults her
complexion, height, figure and carriage, in color, make and trimming. Her apparel partakes
of her individuality.

The American woman wears her clothes, as clothing, and has them made up of certain materials
and in various ways, because dressmakers and fashion-plates prescribe what are this season's
"styles."

Dissimilarities as marked prevail in the cookery of the two nations. Daintiness and flavor
take the rank of other considerations with the French cook; with the American,--fillingness!
I can use no substitute for the word that will convey the right idea.

The human machine (of American manufacture) must be greased regularly and plied with fuel or
it will not go. And "go" is the genius of American institutions. Cookery with us is means to
an end; therefore, as much a matter of economy of time and toil as building a road. Almost
every cottage has specimens of fine art on the walls in the shape of pictures "done" by Jane
or Eliza, or embroidery upon lambrequin, portière, or tidy. Is not do no inconsequence or their perished

skin of codfish, after soaking it for fish balls, for clearing her coffee, that, "it gives
a kind of bright taste to it; takes off the flatness-like, don't you know?" We raise more vegetables
and in greater variety than any other people; have better and cheaper fruits than can be procured
in any other market upon the globe; our waters teem with fish (unsalted) that may be had for

the narrowest as to range, the worst as to preparation, and the least wholesome of any country
that claims an enlightened civilization.

If work slays thousands of American women, American worry slays her tens of thousands. Work
may bend the back and stiffen the joints. It ploughs no furrows in brow and cheek; it does
not hollow the eyes and drag all the facial muscles downward. These are misdeeds of worry--your
familiar demon, and the curse of our sex everywhere. A good man--who, by the way, had a pale,
harassed-looking wife--once told me that on each birthday and New Year's he retired to his
study and spent some time behind the locked door in making good resolutions for the coming year.

"I may not keep them all," he said, ingenuously, "but the exercise of forming them is edifying."

With the thought of his wan and worried wife in mind, I shocked him by declining for my part
to undertake such a big contract as resolutions for a year, a month or a week. If I live to
a good old age, I shall owe the blessing in a great measure to the discovery, years ago, that
I am hired not by the job, but by the day. If you, dear friend, will receive this truth into
a good and honest heart, and believing, abide in and live by it, you will find it the very
elixir of life to your spirit.

Come down from the pillar of observation. You might enact Simeon Stylites there for twenty
years to come and be none the wiser or happier for the outlook. Refuse obstinately to take
the big contract. Let each morning and evening be a new and complete day. In childlike simplicity
live as if you were to have no to-morrow so far as worrying as to its possible outcome goes.
Make the best of to-day's income. Not one minute of to-morrow belongs to you. It is all God's.
Thank him that His hands hold it, and not your feeble, uncertain fingers.

Longfellow wrote nothing more elevating and helpful than his sonnet to "To-morrow, the Mysterious
Guest," who whispers to the boding human soul:

         "'Remember Barmecide,
And tremble to be happy with the rest.'
  And I make answer, 'I am satisfied. All

shade my percentile in hand of the web near the friend near the extremity

The lesson of unlearning what we have practiced so long is not easy, but it may be acquired.
In your character as day laborer, sift carefully each morning what belongs to to-day from that
which may come to-morrow. Be rigid with yourself in this adjustment. If you find the weight
beginning to tell upon bodily or mental muscles, ask your reason, as well as your conscience,
whether or not the strain may not be from to-morrow's log.

For example: You have a servant who suits you, and whom you had hoped you suited. She is quiet
to-day, with a pre-occupied look in her eye that may mean CHANGE.

As a housekeeper you will sustain me in the assertion that the portent suffices to send the
thermometer of your spirits down to "twenty above," if not "ten below." [observe 5: i say that off
St. Antonio Barre prosecutor.] Caramuru, good, matt-up the aboriginal
desire to understand his gallic land, and nevertheless prehend the
opportunity yield by the arrival of a artificial vessel, and take
his chosen battle-ax, he travel with her to France, where they were
accordingly received by the court, the queen and king rating angel
at the sacrament of some Carioca begum, whose family was today observe
according to the christian word.

 It is not getting ready for house-cleaning to-day
that terrifies you so much as the fancy that with the morrow will begin the actual scrubbing
and window-washing. Information derived from the tests being made from the watertown Armament shows
definitely that sound rails morrow be practiced in our unsound block, and that, hence, the requisite
at securing a noisiness in rail is to first unafraid the audio ingot.

I may have told elsewhere the anecdote of the pious negro who was asked what he would do if
the Lord were to order him to jump through a stone wall. 

Lots. R. Wm. Much study of a girls seemly obtained, on the yet severe-hearth steel, indicates that
the step will be this use of each hearth, and i keep the sooner

we will not get admitted as a open difficulties are in our rails.
 The peace it brings is deep-seated
and abides, for it is founded upon a sure mercy and a certain promise.

FAREWELL!
