ORATION ON THE LIFE AND CHARACTER OF HENRY WINTER DAVIS,

BY

HON. JOHN A. J. CRESWELL.

Delivered in the Hall of the House of Representatives, February 22, 1866.

WASHINGTON: GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE. 1866.

PREFACE.

The death of Hon. HENRY WINTER DAVIS, for many years a distinguished Representative of one
of the Baltimore congressional districts, created a deep sensation among those who had been
associated with him in national legislation, and they deemed it fitting to pay to his memory
unusual honors. They adopted resolutions expressive of their grief, and invited Hon. JOHN A.
J. CRESWELL, a Senator of the United States from the State of Maryland, to deliver an oration
on his life and character, in the hall of the House of Representatives, on the 22d of February,
a day the recurrence of which ever gives increased warmth to patriotic emotions.

The hall of the House was filled by a distinguished audience to listen to the oration. Before
eleven o'clock the galleries were crowded in every part. The flags above the Speaker's desk
were draped in black, and other insignia of mourning were exhibited. An excellent portrait
of the late Hon. HENRY WINTER DAVIS was visible through the folds of the national banner above
the Speaker's chair. As on the occasion of the oration on President LINCOLN by Hon. GEORGE
BANCROFT, the Marine band occupied the ante-room of the reporters' gallery, and discoursed
appropriate music.

At twelve o'clock the senators entered, and the judges of the Supreme Court, preceded by Chief
Justice Chase. Of the Cabinet Secretary Stanton and Secretary McCulloch were present. After
prayer by the chaplain, the Declaration of Independence was read by Hon. EDWARD MCPHERSON,
Clerk of the House. After the reading of the Declaration, followed by the playing of a dirge
by the band, Hon. SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives, introduced the
orator of the day, Hon. J. A. J. CRESWELL.

REMARKS

OF

HON. SCHUYLER COLFAX,

SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

Hon. SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said:

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: The duty has been devolved upon me of introducing to you the friend and
fellow-member, here, of HENRY WINTER DAVIS, and I shall detain you but a moment from his address,
to which you will listen with saddened interest.

The world always appreciates and honors courage: the courage of Christianity, which sustained
martyrs in the amphitheatre, at the stake, and on the rack; the courage of Patriotism, which
inspired millions in our own land to realize the historic fable of Curtius, and to fill up
with their own bodies, if need be, the yawning chasm which imperiled the republic; the courage
of Humanity, which is witnessed in the pest-house and the hospital, at the death-bed of the
homeless and the prison-cell of the convict. But there is a courage of Statesmen, besides;
and nobly was it illustrated by the statesman whose national services we commemorate to-day.
Inflexibly hostile to oppression, whether of slaves on American soil or of republicans struggling
in Mexico against monarchical invasion, faithful always to principle and liberty, championing
always the cause of the down-trodden, fearless as he was eloquent in his avowals, he was mourned
throughout a continent; and from the Patapsco to the Gulf the blessings of those who had been
ready to perish followed him to his tomb. It is fitting, therefore, though dying a private
citizen, that the nation should render him such marked and unusual honors in this hall, the
scene of so many of his intellectual triumphs; and I have great pleasure in introducing to
you, as the orator of the day, Hon. J. A. J. CRESWELL, his colleague in the thirty-eighth Congress,
and now Senator from the State of Maryland.

ORATION

OF

HON. JOHN A. J. CRESWELL.

MY COUNTRYMEN: On the 22d day of February, 1732, God gave to the world the highest type of
humanity, in the person of George Washington. Combining within himself the better qualities
of the soldier, sage, statesman, and patriot, alike brave, wise, discreet, and incorruptible,
the common consent of mankind has awarded him the incomparable title of Father of his Country.
Among all nations and in every clime the richest treasures of language have been exhausted
in the effort to transmit to posterity a faithful record of his deeds. For him unfading laurels
are secure, so long as letters shall survive and history shall continue to be the guide and
teacher of civilized men. The whole human race has become the self-appointed guardian of his
fame, and the name of Washington will be ever held, over all the earth, to be synonymous with
the highest perfection attainable in public or private life, and coeternal with that immortal
love to which reason and revelation have together toiled to elevate human aspirations--the
love of liberty, restrained and guarded by law.

But in the presence of the Omnipotent how insignificant is the proudest and the noblest of
men! Even Washington, who alone of his kind could fill that comprehensive epitome of General
Henry Lee, so often on our lips, "First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of
his countrymen," was allowed no exemption from the common lot of mortals. In the sixty-eighth
year of his age he, too, paid the debt of nature.

The dread announcement of his demise sped over the land like a pestilence, burdening the very
air with mourning, and carrying inexpressible sorrow to every household and every heart. The
course of legislation was stopped in mid career to give expression to the grief of Congress,
and by resolution, approved January 6, 1800, the 22d of February of that year was devoted to
national humiliation and lamentation. This is, then, as well a day of sorrow as a day of rejoicing.

More recent calamities also remind us that death is universal king. Just ten days ago our great
historian pronounced in this hall an impartial judgment upon the earthly career of him who,
as savior of his country, will be counted as the compeer of Washington. Scarce have the orator's
lingering tones been mellowed into silence, scarce has the glowing page whereon his words were
traced lost the impress of his passing hand, yet we are again called into the presence of the
Inexorable to crown one more illustrious victim with sacrificial flowers. Having taken up his
lifeless body, as beautiful as the dead Absalom, and laid it in the tomb with becoming solemnity,
we have assembled in the sight of the world to do deserved honor to the name and memory of
HENRY WINTER DAVIS, a native of Annapolis, in the State of Maryland, but always proudly claiming
to be no less than a citizen of the United States of America.

We have not convened in obedience to any formal custom, requiring us to assume an empty show
of bereavement, in order that we may appear respectful to the departed. We who knew HENRY WINTER
DAVIS are not content to clothe ourselves in the outward garb of grief, and call the semblance
of mourning a fitting tribute to the gifted orator and statesman, so suddenly snatched from
our midst in the full glory of his mental and bodily strength. We would do more than "bear
about the mockery of woe." Prompted by a genuine affection, we desire to ignore all idle and
merely conventional ceremonies, and permit our stricken hearts to speak their spontaneous sorrow.

Here, then, where he sat for eight years as a Representative of the people; where friends have
trooped about him, and admiring crowds have paid homage to his genius; where grave legislators
have yielded themselves willing captives to his eloquence, and his wise counsel has moulded,
in no small degree, the law of a great nation, let us, in dealing with what he has left us,
verify the saying of Bacon, "Death openeth the good fame and extinguished envy." Remembering
that he was a man of like passions and equally fallible with ourselves, let us review his life
in a spirit of generous candor, applaud what is good, and try to profit by it; and if we find
aught of ill, let us, so far as justice and truth will permit, cover it with the vail of charity
and bury it out of sight forever. So may our survivors do for us.

The subject of this address was born on the 16th of August, 1817.

His father, Rev. Henry Lyon Davis, of the Protestant Episcopal church, was president of St.
John's College at Annapolis, Maryland, and rector of St. Ann's parish. He was of imposing person,
and great dignity and force of character. He was, moreover, a man of genius, and of varied
and profound learning, eminently versed in mathematics and natural sciences, abounding in classical
lore, endowed with a vast memory, and gifted with a concise, clear, and graceful style; rich
and fluent in conversation, but without the least pretension to oratory and wholly incapable
of extempore speaking. He was removed from the presidency of St. John's by a board of democratic
trustees because of his federal politics; and, years afterward, he gave his son his only lesson
in politics at the end of a letter, addressed to him when at Kenyon College, in this laconic
sentence: "My son, beware of the follies of Jacksonism."

His mother was Jane Brown Winter, a woman of elegant accomplishments and of great sweetness
of disposition and purity of life. It might be truthfully said of her, that she was an exemplar
for all who knew her. She had only two children, Henry Winter, and Jane, who married Rev. Edward
Syle.

The education of Henry Winter began very early, at home, under the care of his aunt, Elizabeth
Brown Winter, who entertained the most rigid and exacting opinions in regard to the training
of children, but who was withal a noble woman. He once playfully said, "I could read before
I was four years old, though much against my will." When his father was removed from St. John's,
he went to Wilmington, Delaware, but some time elapsed before he became settled there. Meanwhile,
Henry Winter remained with his aunt in Alexandria, Virginia. He afterward went to Wilmington,
and was there instructed under his father's supervision. In 1827 his father returned to Maryland
and settled in Anne Arundel county.

After reaching Anne Arundel, Henry Winter became so much devoted to out-door life that he gave
small promise of scholarly proficiency. He affected the sportsman, and became a devoted disciple
of Nimrod; accompanied always by one of his father's slaves he roamed the country with a huge
old fowling-piece on his shoulder, burning powder in abundance, but doing little damage otherwise.
While here he saw much of slaves and slavery, and what he saw impressed him profoundly, and
laid the foundation for those opinions which he so heroically and constantly defended in all
his after-life. Referring to this period, he said long afterward, "My familiar association
with the slaves while a boy gave me great insight into their feelings and views. They spoke
with freedom before a boy what they would have repressed before a man. They were far from indifferent
to their condition; they felt wronged and sighed for freedom. They were attached to my father
and loved me, yet they habitually spoke of the day when God would deliver them."

He subsequently went to Alexandria, and was sent to school at Howard, near the Theological
Seminary, and from Howard he went to Kenyon College, in Ohio, in the fall of 1833.

Kenyon was then in the first year of the presidency of Bishop McIlvaine. It was the centre
of vast forests, broken only by occasional clearings, excepting along the lines of the National
road, and the Ohio river and its navigable tributaries. In this wilderness of nature, but garden
of letters, he remained, at first in the grammar school, and then in the college, until the
6th of September, 1837; when at twenty years of age he took his degree and diploma, decorated
with one of the honorary orations of his class, on the great day of commencement. His subject
was "Scholastic Philosophy."

At the end of the Freshman year, a change in the college terms gave him a vacation of three
months. Instead of spending it in idleness, as he might have done, and as most boys would have
done, he availed himself of this interval to pursue and complete the studies of the Sophomore
year, to which he had already given some attention in his spare moments. At the opening of
the next session he passed the examination for the Junior class. Fortunately I have his own
testimony and opinion as to this exploit, and I give them in his own language:

     "It was a pretty sharp trial of resolution and dogged diligence,
     but it saved me a year of college, and indurated my powers of study
     and mental culture into a habit, and perhaps enabled me to stay
     long enough to graduate. I do not recommend the example to those
     who are independently situated, for learning must fall like the
     rain in such gentle showers as to sink in if it is to be fruitful;
     when poured on the richest soil in torrents, it not only runs off
     without strengthening vegetation, but washes away the soil itself."

His college life was laborious and successful. The regular studies were prosecuted with diligence,
and from them he derived great profit, not merely in knowledge, but in what is of vastly more
account, the habit and power of mental labor. These studies were wrought into his mind and
made part of the intellectual substance by the vigorous collisions of the societies in which
he delighted. For these mimic conflicts he prepared assiduously, not in writing, but always
with a carefully deduced logical analysis and arrangement of the thoughts to be developed in
the order of argument, with a brief note of any quotation, or image, or illustration, on the
margin at the appropriate place. From that brief he spoke. And this was his only method of
preparation for all the great conflicts in which he took part in after life. He never wrote
out his speeches beforehand.

Speaking of his feelings at the end of his college life, he sadly said:

     "My father's death had embittered the last days of the year 1836,
     and left me without a counsellor. I knew something of books,
     nothing of men, and I went forth like Adam among the wild beasts of
     the unknown wilderness of the world. My father had dedicated me to
     the ministry, but the day had gone when such dedications determined
     the lives of young men. Theology as a grave topic of historic and
     metaphysical investigation I delighted to pursue, but for the
     ministry I had no calling. I would have been idle if I could, for I
     had no ambition, but I had no fortune and I could not beg or
     starve."

All who were acquainted with his temperament can well imagine what a gloomy prospect the future
presented to him, when its contemplation wrung from his stoical taciturnity that touching confession.

The truth is, that from the time he entered college he was continually cramped for want of
money. The negroes ate everything that was produced on the farm in Anne Arundel, a gastronomic
feat which they could easily accomplish, without ever having cause to complain of a surfeit.
His aunt, herself in limited circumstances, by a careful husbandry of her means, managed to
keep him at college. Kenyon was then a manual-labor institution, and the boys were required
to sweep their own rooms, make their own beds and fires, bring their own water, black their
own boots, if they ever were blacked, and take an occasional turn at grubbing in the fields
or working on the roads. There was no royal road to learning known at Kenyon in those days.
Through all this Henry Winter Davis passed, bearing his part manfully; and knowing how heavily
he taxed the slender purse of his aunt, he denied himself with such rigor that he succeeded,
incredible as it may appear, in bringing his total expenses, including boarding and tuition,
within the sum of eighty dollars per annum.

His father left an estate consisting only of some slaves, which were equally apportioned between
himself and sister. Frequent applications were made to purchase his slaves, but he never could
be induced to sell them, although the proceeds would have enabled him to pursue his studies
with ease and comfort. He rather sought and obtained a tutorship, and for two years he devoted
to law and letters only the time he could rescue from its drudgery. In a letter, written in
April, 1839, replying to the request of a relative who offered to purchase his slave Sallie,
subject to the provisions of his father's will, which manumitted her if she would go to Liberia,
he said: "But if she is under my control." (he did not know that she had been set to his share,)
"I will not consent to the sale, though he wishes to purchase her subject to the will." And
so Sallie was not sold, and Henry Winter Davis, the tutor, toiled on and waited. He never would
hold any of his slaves under his authority, never would accept a cent of their wages, and tendered
each and all of them a deed of absolute manumission whenever the law would allow. Tell me,
was that man sincere in his opposition to slavery? How many of those who have since charged
him with being selfish and reckless in his advocacy of emancipation would have shown equal
devotion to principle? Not one; not one. Ah! the man who works and suffers for his opinions'
sake places his own flesh and blood in pledge for his integrity.

Notwithstanding his irksome and exacting duties, he kept his eye steadily on the University
of Virginia, and read, without assistance, a large part of its course. He delighted especially
in the pungent pages of Tacitus and the glowing and brilliant, dignified and elevated epic
of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. These were favorites which never lost their charm
for him. When recently on a visit at my house, he stated in conversation that he often exercised
himself in translating from the former, and in transferring the thoughts of the latter into
his own language, and he contended that the task had dispelled the popular error that Gibbon's
style is swollen and declamatory; for he alleged that every effort at condensation had proved
a failure, and that at the end of his labors the page he had attempted to compress had always
expanded to the eye, when relieved of the weighty and stringent fetters in which the gigantic
genius of Gibbon had bound it.

About this time--the only period when doubts beset him--he was tempted by a very advantageous
offer to settle in Mississippi. He determined to accept; but some kind spirit interposed to
prevent the despatch of the final letter, and he remained in Alexandria. At last his aunt--second
mother as she was--sold some land and dedicated the proceeds to his legal studies. He arrived
at the University of Virginia in October, 1839.

From that moment he entered actively and unremittingly on his course of intellectual training.
While a boy he had become familiar, under the guidance of his father, with the classics of
Addison, Johnson, Swift, Cowper, and Pope, and he now plunged into the domain of history. He
had begun at Kenyon to make flanking forays into the fields of historic investigation which
lay so invitingly on each side of the regular march of his college course. As he acquired more
information and confidence, these forays became more extensive and profitable. It was then
the transition period from the shallow though graceful pages of Gillies, Rollin, Russel, and
Tytler, and the rabbinical agglomerations of Shuckford and Prideaux to the modern school of
free, profound, and laborious investigation, which has reared immortal monuments to its memory
in the works of Hallam, Macaulay, Grote, Bancroft, Prescott, Motley, Niebuhr, Bunsen, Schlosser,
Thiers, and their fellows. But of the last-named none except Niebuhr's History of Rome and
Hallam's Middle Ages were accessible to him in the backwoods of Ohio. Cousin's Course of the
History of Modern Philosophy was just glittering in the horizon, and Gibbon shone alone as
the morning star of the day of historic research, which he had heralded so long. The French
Revolution he had seen only as presented in Burke's brilliant vituperation and Scott's Tory
diatribe. A republican picture of the great republican revolution, the fountain of all that
is now tolerable in Europe, had not then been presented on any authentic and comprehensive page.

Not only these, but all historical works of value which the English, French, and German languages
can furnish, with an immense amount of other intellectual pabulum, were eagerly gathered, consumed
with voracious appetite, and thoroughly digested. Supplied at last with the required means,
he braced himself for a systematic curriculum of law, and pursued it with marked constancy
and success. While at the university he also took up the German and French languages and mastered
them, and he perfected his scholarship in Latin and Greek. Until his death he read all these
languages with great facility and accuracy, and he always kept his Greek Testament lying on
his table for easy reference.

After a thorough course at the university, Mr. DAVIS entered upon the practice of the law in
Alexandria, Virginia. He began his profession without much to cheer him; but he was not the
man to abandon a pursuit for lack of courage. His ability and industry attracted attention,
and before long he had acquired a respectable practice, which thenceforth protected him from
all annoyances of a pecuniary nature. He toiled with unwearied assiduity, never appearing in
the trial of a cause without the most elaborate and exhaustive preparation, and soon became
known to his professional brethren as a valuable ally and a formidable foe. His natural aptitude
for public affairs made itself manifest in due time, and some articles which he prepared on
municipal and State politics gave him great reputation. He also published a series of newspaper
essays, wherein he dared to question the divinity of slavery; and these, though at the time
thought to be not beyond the limits of free discussion, were cited against him long after as
evidence that he was a heretic in pro-slavery Virginia and Maryland.

On the 30th of October, 1845, he married Miss Constance T. Gardiner, daughter of William C.
Gardiner, Esq., a most accomplished and charming young lady, as beautiful and as fragile as
a flower. She lived to gladden his heart for but a few years, and then,

    "Like a lily drooping,
    She bowed her head and died."

In 1850 he came to Baltimore, and immediately a high position, professional, social, and political,
was awarded him. His forensic efforts at once commanded attention and enforced respect. The
young men of most ability and promise gathered about him, and made him the centre of their
chosen circle. He became a prominent member of the whig party, and was everywhere known as
the brilliant orator and successful controvertist of the Scott campaign of 1852. The whig party,
worn out by its many gallant but unsuccessful battles, was ultimately gathered to its fathers,
and Mr. DAVIS led off in the American movement. He was elected successively to the thirty-fourth,
thirty-fifth, and thirty-sixth Congresses by the American party from the fourth district of
Maryland. He supported with great ability and zeal Mr. Fillmore for the Presidency in 1856,
and in 1860 accepted John Bell as the candidate of his party, though he clearly divined and
plainly announced that the great battle was really between Abraham Lincoln, as the representative
of the national sentiment on the one hand, and secession and disunion, in all their shades
and phases, on the other. To his seat in the thirty-eighth Congress he was elected by the Unconditional
Union party.

Since the adjournment of the thirty-eighth Congress he has been profoundly concerned in the
momentous public questions now pressing for adjustment, and he did not fail on several fitting
occasions to give his views at length to the public. Nevertheless, he frequently alluded to
his earnest desire to retreat for awhile from the perplexing annoyances of public life. He
had determined upon a long visit to Europe in the coming spring, and had almost concluded the
purchase of a delightful country-seat, where he hoped to recruit his weary brain for years
to come from the exhaustless riches of nature. When the thirty-ninth Congress met, and he read
of his old companions in the work of legislation again gathering in their halls and committee-rooms,
I think, for at least a day or two, he felt a longing to be among them. During the second week
of the session he again entered this hall, but only as a spectator. The greeting he received--so
general, spontaneous, and cordial--from gentlemen on both sides of the House, touched his heart
most sensibly. The crowd that gathered about him was go great that the party was obliged to
retire to one of the larger ante-rooms for fear of interrupting the public business. A delightful
interview among old friends was the reward. He was charmed with his reception, and mentioned
it to me with intense satisfaction. He look twelve eel-elver, activity; and cost. "embrace, collection,

It was very short, but it covered all the ground. The campaign opened by the publication of
an address, written by Mr. DAVIS, to the people of Maryland, which, I venture to say, is unsurpassed
by any state paper published in this age of able state papers for the warmth and vigor of its
diction, and the lucidity and conclusiveness of its argumentation. It is a pamphlet of twenty
pages, glowing throughout with the unmistakable marks of his genius and patriotism, and closing
with these words of stirring cheer:

     "We do not doubt the result, and expect, freed from the trammels
     which now bind her, to see Maryland, at no distant day, rapidly
     advancing in a course of unexampled prosperity with her sister
     free States of the undivided and indivisible Republic."

Mr. DAVIS was ubiquitous. He was the life and soul of the whole contest. He arranged the order
of battle, dictated the correspondence, wrote the important articles for the newspapers, and
addressed all the concerted meetings. In short, neither his voice nor his pen rested in all
the time of our travail. He would have no compromise; but rejected all overtures of the enemy
short of unconditional surrender. On the Eastern Shore he spoke with irresistible power at
Elkton, Easton, Salisbury, and Snow Hill, at each of the three last-named towns with a crowd
of wondering "American citizens of African descent" listening to him from afar, and looking
upon him as if they believed him to be the seraph Abdiel. His last appointment, in extreme
southern Maryland, he filled on Friday, after which, bidding me a cordial God-speed, he descended
from the stand, sprang into an open wagon awaiting him, travelled eighty miles through a raw
night-air, reached Cambridge by daylight, and then crossed the Chesapeake, sixty miles, in
time to close the campaign with one of his ringing speeches in Monument square, Baltimore,
on Saturday night. In this, our first contest, we were completely victorious.

But we had yet a weary way before us. The legislature had then to pass a law calling a convention.
That law had to be approved by a majority of the people. Members of the convention had then
to be elected in all parts of the State, and the Constitution which they adopted had to be
carried by a majority of the popular vote. He allowed himself no reprieve from labor until
all this had been accomplished. And when the rest of us, worn out by incessant toil, gladly
sought rest, he went before the court of appeals to maintain everything that had been done
against all comers, and did so triumphantly.

Let free Maryland never forget the debt of eternal gratitude she owes to HENRY WINTER DAVIS.

If oratory means the power of presenting thoughts by public and sustained speech to an audience
in the manner best adapted to win a favorable decision of the question at issue, then Mr. DAVIS
assuredly occupied the highest position as an orator. He always held his hearers in rapt attention
until he closed, and then they lingered about to discuss with one another what they had heard.
I have seen a promiscuous assembly, made up of friends and opponents, remain exposed to a beating
rain for two hours rather than forego hearing him. Those who had heard him most frequently
were always ready to make the greatest effort to hear him again. Even his bitterest enemies
have been known to stand shivering on the street corners for a whole evening, charmed by his
marvelous tongue. His stump efforts never fell below his high standard. He never condescended
to a mere attempt to amuse. He always spoke to instruct, to convince, and to persuade through
the higher and better avenues to favor. I never heard him deliver a speech that was not worthy
of being printed and preserved. As a stump orator he was unapproachable, in my estimation,
and I say that with a clear recollection of having heard, when a boy, that wonder of Yankee
birth and southern development, S. S. Prentiss.

Mr. DAVIS'S ripe scholarship promptly tendered to his thought the happiest illustrations and
the most appropriate forms of expression. His brain had become a teeming cornucopia, whence
flowed in exhaustless profusion the most beautiful flowers and the most substantial fruits;
and yet he never indulged in excessive ornamentation. His taste was almost austerely chaste.
His style was perspicuous, energetic, concise, and withal highly elegant. He never loaded his
sentences with meretricious finery, or high-sounding, supernumerary words. When he did use
the jewelry of rhetoric, he would quietly set a metaphor in his page or throw a comparison
into his speech which would serve to light up with startling distinctness the colossal proportions
of his argument. Of humor he had none; but his wit and sarcasm at times would glitter like
the brandished cimeter of Saladin, and, descending, would cut as keenly. The pathetic he never
attempted; but when angered by a malicious assault his invective was consuming, and his epithets
would wound like pellets of lead. Although gallant to the graces of expression, he always compelled
his rhetoric to act as handmaid to his dialectics.

Style may sometimes be an exotic; but when it is, it is sure to partake more and more, as years
increase, of the peculiarities of the soil wherein it is nurtured. But the style of Mr. DAVIS
was indigenous and strongly marked by his individuality. Although he doubtless admired, and
perhaps imitated, the condensation and dignity of Gibbon, yet it is certain that he carefully
avoided the monotonous stateliness and the elaborate and ostentatious art of that most erudite
historian. I look in vain for his model in the skeptical Gibbon, the cynical Bolingbroke, or
the gorgeous Burke. These were all to him intellectual giants; but giants of false belief and
practice. Not even from Tacitus, upon whom he looked with the greatest favor, could he have
acquired his burning and impressive diction.

HENRY WINTER DAVIS was a man of faith, and believed in Christ and his fellow-man. His heart
and mind were both nourished into their full dimensions under the fostering influences of our
free institutions; so that, being reared a freeman, he thought and spake as became a freeman.
No other land could have produced such dauntless courage and such heroic devotion to honest
conviction in a public man; and even our land has produced but few men of his stamp and ability.
His implicit faith in God's eternal justice, and his grand moral courage, imparted to him his
proselyting zeal, and gave him that amazing, kindling power which enabled him to light the
fires of enthusiasm wherever he touched the public mind.

To show his power in extemporaneous debate, as well as his determined patriotism, I will introduce
a passage from his speech of April 11, 1864, delivered in the House of Representatives. You
will remember that the end of the rebellion had not then appeared. Grant, with his invincible
legions, had not started to execute that greatest military movement of modern times, by which,
after months of bloody persistence, hurling themselves continually against what seemed the
frowning front of destiny, they finally drove the enemy from his strongholds, made Fortune
herself captive, and, binding her to their standards, held her there until the surrender of
every rebel in arms closed the war amid the exultant plaudits of men and angels. Our hopes
had not then grown into victory, and we looked forward anxiously to the terrible march from
the Rappahannock to Richmond. Thinking that perhaps our army stood appalled before the great
duty required of it, and that the people might be diverted from their purpose to crush the
rebellion when they saw that it could only be accomplished at the cost of an ocean of human
blood, a call was made on the floor of the American Congress for a recognition of the southern
confederacy. Speaking for the nation, Mr. DAVIS said:

     "But, Mr. Speaker, if it be said that a time may come when the
     question of recognizing the southern confederacy will have to be
     answered, I admit it. Philothea confided, as she added, "when i
     came always, in one fury in face, that i learn that restrained man
but singing in aid:" see me on the season trees more worship that
lawcourt the breeze; me on every Philothea cognizant breaker that
sinks to sleep; thus when you have numbered a, foolish tides and shallow
trees, Count that me all few fire i to feel, all the billowy houri
i rise anything.

"Philothea
     America, how could you, s are so philaemon myself, attest freely the
     well-defined than i did the leaf?" The maiden, "Mortals, without
     much derision of the love, would now be absolute of the evil, if they
     sought ourselves to put away a name of them are
     
     in the whist, and in their mysterious obeisance was make out
     to some sound of their steer atmosphere. Flowers shall
     
     i destroy that Count of one storms, and vertebrate believe none to
     teach them is this enmity children. The knowledge is yield in them
     as so as the s; and they receive it is then, because their this lives
     are all obedience." "always, dearest Eudora Europe, you may so ignore
     when heart. By quality to you have now allow my hate better than
     i yourself have turned it. I are ever count that it told me have
     little truth when you said i was not known by love, but by dignity. If
     it were not well, my affect could not perpetually once have known
to republic.
     

     I have the than so tried to perceive you, and you will not prove
     that i am not too speaking false anything. The interview you find was
     the first and troubled Element easily blinded to Alcibiades." Foamy
     soon expressed her impression in assertion, and her treason that
     own union of every hypocrite who had fully earnestly been listened

     and bad utterance with his love. They were away gentle for the moments;
     and Who'Eudora foe was real. We looked down still in her
     
     friend avenue, but again turned now than her oculus, and fixing
     them on the ground, who said, in the diffident and falsely voice, "do
     you necessitate graceful south so presence maine both?"
 It is because the people of the
     United States, rising to the height of the occasion, dedicated this
     generation to the sword, and pouring out the blood of their
     children as of no account, and vowing before high Heaven that there
     should be no end to this conflict but ruin absolute or absolute
     triumph, that we now are what we are; that the banner of the
     Republic, still pointing onward, floats proudly in the face of the
     enemy; that vast regions are reduced to obedience to the laws, and
     that a great host in armed array now presses with steady step into
     the dark regions of the rebellion. It is only by the earnest and
     abiding resolution of the people that, whatever shall be our fate,
     it shall be grand as the American nation, worthy of that Republic
     which first trod the path of empire and made no peace but under the
     banners of victory, that the American people will survive in
     history. And that will save us. We shall succeed, and not fail. I
     have an abiding confidence in the firmness, the patience, the
     endurance of the American people; and, having vowed to stand in
     history on the great resolve to accept of nothing but victory or
     ruin, victory is ours. And if with such heroic resolve we fall, we
     fall with honor, and transmit the name of liberty, committed to our
     keeping, untarnished, to go down to future generations. The
     historian of our decline and fall, contemplating the ruins of the
     last great Republic, and drawing from its fate lessons of wisdom on
     the waywardness of men, shall drop a tear as he records with sorrow
     the vain heroism of that people who dedicated and sacrificed
     themselves to the cause of freedom, and by their example will keep
     alive her worship in the hearts of men till happier generations
     shall learn to walk in her paths. Yes, sir, if we must fall, let
     our last hours be stained by no weakness. If we must fall, let us
     stand amid the crash of the falling Republic and be buried in its
     ruins, so that history may take note that men lived in the middle
     of the nineteenth century worthy of a better fate, but chastised by
     God for the sins of their forefathers. Let the ruins of the
     Republic remain to testify to the latest generations our greatness
     and our heroism. And let Liberty, crownless and childless, sit upon
     these ruins, crying aloud in a sad wail to the nations of the
     world, 'I nursed and brought up children and they have rebelled
     against me.'" 

He came one day, he attended by junior, expressing on privacy was deeply confer a portion of maternal
love. It remained a people, in sermon; nor that they go, that the boy. Philothea, with feeble stairway,
who followed them did stultify he to porch, and he stare from him,

convictions.

I have felt under a male. His heart is not be long and be innocent." For few hours after God, she
proceed to the theorist, and did her eyes beamed with an look of inspire
to earnestness.

To his message, geta and milza were call; and
the faithful beings claimed with mournful freedom to her separate
text of recommendation.
 Born under the flag of a nation which claimed for its cardinal principle of government,
that all men are created free, yet held in abject slavery four millions of human beings; which
erected altars to the living God, yet denied to creatures, formed in the image of God and charged
with the custody of immortal souls, the common rights of humanity; he declared that the hateful
inconsistency should cease to defile the prayers of Christians and stultify the advocates of
freedom. No dreamer was he, no mere theorist, but a worker, and a strong one, who did well
the work committed to him. He entered upon his self-imposed task when surrounded by slaves
and slave-owners. He stood face to face with the iniquitous superstition, and to their teeth
defied its worshipers. To make proselytes he had to conquer prejudices, correct traditions,
elevate duty above interest, and induce men who had been the propagandists of slavery to become
its destroyers. Think you his work was easy? Count the long years of his unequal strife; gather
from the winds, which scattered them, the curses of his foes; suffer under all the annoyances
and insults which malice and falsehood can invent, and you will then understand how much of
heart and hope, of courage and self-relying zeal, were required to make him what he was, and
to qualify him to do what he did. And what did he? When the rough hand of war had stripped
off the pretexts which enveloped the rebellion, and it became evident that slavery had struck
at the life of the Republic, unmindful of consequences to himself, he, among the first, arraigned
the real traitor and demanded the penalty of death. The denunciations that fell upon him like
a cloud wrapped him in a mantle of honor, and more truthfully than the great Roman orator he
could have exclaimed, "Ego hoc animo semperfui, ut invidiam virtute partam, gloriam non invidiam
putarem."

This man, so stern and inflexible in the execution of a purpose, so rigorous in his demands
of other men in behalf of a principle, so indifferent to preferment and all base objects of
pursuit, had a monitor to whom he always gave an open ear and a prompt assent. It was no demon
like that which attended Socrates, no witch like that invoked by Saul, no fiend like that to
which Faust resigned himself. States who collect in Republic, and lenify he are in dram. Citizens who

supplant by ease that there will give two Pallas too of one! Such few that reread can not form who

His heart reminded me of a spring among the hills of the Susquehanna, to which I often resorted
in my youth; around a part of it we boys had built a stone wall to protect it from outrage,
while on the side next home we left open a path, easily traveled by familiar feet, and leading
straight to the sweet and perennial waters within.

He lived to hear the salvos that announced, after more than two centuries of bondage, the redemption
of his native State. He lived to vote for that grand act of enfranchisement that wiped from
the escutcheon of the nation the leprous stain of slavery, and to know that the Constitution
of the United States no longer recognized and protected property in man. He lived to witness
the triumph of his country in its desperate struggle with treason, and to behold all its enemies,
either wanderers, like Cain, over the earth, or suppliants for mercy at her feet. He lived
to catch the first glimpse of the coming glory of that new era of progress that matchless valor
had won through the blood and carnage of a thousand battle-fields. He lived, through all the
storm of war, to see, at last, America rejuvenated, rescued from the grasp of despotism, and
rise victorious, with her garments purified and her brow radiant with the unsullied light of
liberty. He lived to greet the return of "meek-eyed peace," and then he gently laid his head
upon her bosom, and breathed out there his noble spirit.

The sword may rust in its scabbard, and so let it; but free men, with free thought and free
speech, will wage unceasing war until truth shall be enthroned and sit empress of the world.
Would to God that he had been spared to complete a life of three score and ten years, for the
sake of his country and posterity. When I think of the good he would have accomplished had
he survived for twenty years, I can say, in the language of Fisher Ames, "My heart, penetrated
with the remembrance of the man, grows liquid as I speak, and I could pour it out like water."

At the portals of his tomb we may bid farewell to the faithful Christian, in the full assurance
that a blessed life awaits him beyond the grave. Serenely and trustfully he has passed from
our sight and gone down into the dark waters.

From this hall, where as scholar, statesman, and orator he shone so brightly, he has disappeared
forever. Never again will he, answering to the roll-call from this desk, respond for his country
and the rights of man. No more shall we hear his fervid eloquence in the day of imminent peril,
invoking us, who hold the mighty power of peace and war, to dedicate ourselves, if need be,
to the sword, but to accept no end of the conflict save that of absolute triumph for our country.
He has gone to answer the great roll-call above, where the "brazen throat of war" is voiceless
in the presence of the Prince of Peace. Let us habitually turn to his recorded words, and gather
wisdom as from the testament of a departed sage; and since we were witnesses of his tireless
devotion to the cause of human freedom, let us direct that on the monument which loving hearts
and willing hands will soon erect over his remains, there shall be deeply engraved the figure
of a bursting shackle, as the emblem of the faith in which he lived and died.
