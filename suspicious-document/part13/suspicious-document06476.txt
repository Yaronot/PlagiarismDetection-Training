INTRODUCTION

The new significance of education

The last century has witnessed an unprecedented development in the significance of education.
One direct consequence has been an increased reverence for childhood.  In this movement which
has increased the dignity of children and schools, two large forces have been at work,--one
social and the other scientific.  The growth of the democratic spirit among men and institutions
has made the education of children a public necessity, and lifted the school to a position
of high social importance.  The application of the theory of evolution to man and his life
has revealed human infancy as one of the largest factors making for the superiority of man
in the struggle for existence, and given to childhood a vast biological importance.  The necessities
of democracy and the truths of science, acting more or less independently of each other, have
given to education a breadth of meaning which it did not possess before.  They have shown that
infancy is the largest opportunity and education the most powerful instrument for the conscious
adjustment of man to the physical and social world in which he lives.

Democracy changes the function of schools

It was the attempt of democracy to educate all of its children which was the initial and important
event that provoked large changes in our notions of the social function of education. Begin, has not

  So instead of being born with
a few simple capacities thoroughly organized, man came at last to be born with the germs of
many complex capacities which were reserved to be unfolded and enhanced or checked and stifled
by the incidents of personal experience in each individual.  In this simple yet wonderful way
there has been provided for man a long period during which his mind is plastic and malleable,
and the length of this period has increased with civilization until it now covers nearly one
third of our lives.  It is not that our inherited tendencies and aptitudes are not still the
main thing.  It is only that we have at last acquired great power to modify them by training,
so that progress may go on with ever-increasing sureness and rapidity.

In thus pointing out the causes of infancy, we have at the same time witnessed some of its
effects.  One effect, of stupendous importance, remains to be pointed out.  As helpless babyhood
came more and more to depend on parental care, the correlated feelings were developed on the
part of parents, and the fleeting sexual relations established among mammals in general were
gradually exchanged for permanent relations.  A cow feels strong maternal affection for her
nursing calf, but after the calf is fully grown, though doubtless she distinguishes it from
other members of the herd, it is not clear that she entertains for it any parental feeling.
But with our half-human forefathers it is not difficult to see how infancy extending over several
years must have tended gradually to strengthen the relations of the children to the mother,
and eventually to both parents, and thus give rise to the permanent organization of the family.
When this step was accomplished we may say that the Creation of Man had been achieved. For
through the organization of the family has arisen that of the clan or tribe, which has formed,
as it were, the cellular tissue out of which the most complex human society has come to be
constructed.  And out of that subordination of individual desires to the common interest, which
first received a definite direction when the family was formed, there grew the rude beginnings
of human morality.

It was thus through the lengthening of his infancy that the highest of animals came to be Man,--a
creature with definite social relationships and with an element of plasticity in his organization
such as has come at last to make his difference from all other animals a difference in kind.
Here at last there had come upon the scene a creature endowed with the capacity for progress,
and a new chapter was thus opened in the history of creation.  But it was not to be expected
that man should all at once learn how to take advantage of this capacity.  Nature, which is
said to make no jumps, surely did not jump here.  The whole history of civilization, indeed,
is largely the history of man's awkward and stumbling efforts to avail himself of this flexibility
of mental constitution with which God has endowed him.  For many a weary age the progress men
achieved was feeble and halting.  Though it had ceased to be physically necessary for each
generation to tread exactly in the steps of its predecessor, yet the circumstances of primitive
society long made it very difficult for any deviation to be effected.  For the tribes of primitive
men were perpetually at war with each other, and their methods of tribal discipline were military
methods.  To allow much freedom of thought would be perilous, and the whole tribe was supposed
to be responsible for the words and deeds of each of its members.  The tribes most rigorous
in this stern discipline were those which killed out tribes more loosely organized, and thus
survived to hand down to coming generations their ideas and their methods.  From this state
of things an intense social conservatism was begotten,--a strong disposition on the part of
society to destroy the flexible-minded individual who dares to think and behave differently
from his fellows.  During the past three thousand years much has been done to weaken this conservatism
by putting an end to the state of things which produced it.  As great and strong societies
have arisen, as the sphere of warfare has diminished while the sphere of industry has enlarged,
the need for absolute conformity has ceased to be felt, while the advantages of freedom and
variety come to be ever more clearly apparent.  At a late stage of civilization, the flexible
or plastic society acquires even a military advantage over the society that is more rigid,
as in the struggle between French and English civilization for primacy in the world.  In our
own country, the political birth of which dates from the triumph of England in that mighty
struggle, the element of plasticity in man's nature is more thoroughly heeded, more fully taken
account of, than in any other community known to history; and herein lies the chief potency
of our promise for the future.  We have come to the point where we are beginning to see that
we may safely depart from unreasoning routine, and, with perfect freedom of thinking in science
and in religion, with new methods of education that shall train our children to think for themselves
while they interrogate Nature with a courage and an insight that shall grow ever bolder and
keener, we may ere long be able fully to avail ourselves of the fact that we come into the
world as little children with undeveloped powers wherein lie latent all the boundless possibilities
of a higher and grander Humanity than has yet been seen upon the earth.

II

THE PART PLAYED BY INFANCY IN THE EVOLUTION OF MAN

The remarks which my friend Mr. Clark has made with reference to the reconciling of science
and religion seem to carry me back to the days when I first became acquainted with the fact
that there were such things afloat in the world as speculations about the origin of man from
lower forms of life; and I can recall step by step various stages in which that old question
has come to have a different look from what it had thirty years ago.  One of the commonest
objections we used to hear, from the mouths of persons who could not very well give voice to
any other objection, was that anybody, whether he knows much or little about evolution, must
have the feeling that there is something degrading about being allied with lower forms of life.
That was, I suppose, owing to the survival of the old feeling that a dignified product of creation
ought to have been produced in some exceptional way.  That which was done in the ordinary way,
that which was done through ordinary processes of causation, seemed to be cheapened and to
lose its value.  It was a remnant of the old state of feeling which took pleasure in miracles,
which seemed to think that the object of thought was more dignified if you could connect it
with something supernatural; that state of culture in which there was an altogether inadequate
appreciation of the amount of grandeur that there might be in the slow creative work that goes
on noiselessly by little minute increments, even as the dropping of the water that wears away
the stone.  The general progress of familiarity with the conception of evolution has done a
great deal to change that state of mind.  Even persons who have not much acquaintance with
science have at length caught something of its lesson,--that the infinitely cumulative action
of small causes like those which we know is capable of producing results of the grandest and
most thrilling importance, and that the disposition to recur to the cataclysmic and miraculous
is only a tendency of the childish mind which we are outgrowing with wider experience.

The whole doctrine of evolution, and in fact the whole advance of modern science from the days
of Copernicus down to the present day, have consisted in the substitution of processes which
are familiar and the application of those processes, showing how they produce great results.

When Darwin's "Origin of Species" was first published, when it gave us that wonderful explanation
of the origin of forms of life from allied forms through the operation of natural selection,
it must have been like a mental illumination to every person who comprehended it.  But after
all it left a great many questions unexplained, as was natural.  It accounted for the phenomena
of organic development in general with wonderful success, but it must have left a great many
minds with the feeling: If man has been produced in this way, if the mere operation of natural
selection has produced the human race, wherein is the human race anyway essentially different
from lower races?  Is not man really dethroned, taken down from that exceptional position in
which we have been accustomed to place him, and might it not be possible, in the course of
the future, for other beings to come upon the earth as far superior to man as man is superior
to the fossilized dragons of Jurassic antiquity?

Such questions used to be asked, and when they were asked, although one might have a very strong
feeling that it was not so, at the same time one could not exactly say why.  One could not
then find any scientific argument for objections to that point of view.  But with the further
development of the question the whole subject began gradually to wear a different appearance;
and I am going to give you a little bit of autobiography, because I think it may be of some
interest in this connection.  I am going to mention two or three of the successive stages which
the whole question took in my own mind as one thing came up after another, and how from time
to time it began to dawn upon me that I had up to that point been looking at the problem from
not exactly the right point of view.

When Darwin's "Descent of Man" was published in 1871, it was of course a book characterized
by all his immense learning, his wonderful fairness of spirit and fertility of suggestion.
Still, one could not but feel that it did not solve the question of the origin of man.  There
was one great contrast between that book and his "Origin of Species."  In the earlier treatise
he undertook to point out a vera causa of the origin of species, and he did it. In his "Descent
of Man" he brought together a great many minor generalizations which facilitated the understanding
of man's origin.  But he did not come at all near to solving the central problem, nor did he
anywhere show clearly why natural selection might not have gone on forever producing one set
of beings after another distinguishable chiefly by physical differences.  But Darwin's co-discoverer,
Alfred Russel Wallace, at an early stage in his researches, struck out a most brilliant and
pregnant suggestion.  In that one respect Wallace went further than ever Darwin did.  It was
a point of which, indeed, Darwin admitted the importance.  It was a point of which nobody could
fail to understand the importance, that in the course of the evolution of a very highly organized
animal, if there came a point at which it was of more advantage to that animal to have variations
in his intelligence seized upon and improved by natural selection than to have physical changes
seized upon, then natural selection would begin working almost exclusively upon that creature's
intelligence, and he would develop in intelligence to a great extent, while his physical organism
would change but slightly.  Now, that of course applied to the case of man, who is changed
physically but very slightly from the apes, while he has traversed intellectually such a stupendous
chasm.

As soon as this statement was made by Wallace, it seemed to me to open up an entirely new world
of speculation.  There was this enormous antiquity of man, during the greater part of which
he did not know enough to make history.  We see man existing here on the earth, no one can
say how long, but surely many hundreds of thousands of years, yet only during just the last
little fringe of four or five thousand years has he arrived at the point where he makes history.
Before that, something was going on, a great many things were going on, while his ancestors
were slowly growing up to that point of intelligence where it began to make itself felt in
the recording of events.  This agrees with Wallace's suggestion of a long period of psychical
change, accompanied by slight physical change.

  The capacity
for progress begins to come in, and you begin to get at one of the great points in which man
is distinguished from the lower animals, for one of those points is undoubtedly his progressiveness;
and I think that any one will say, with very little hesitation, that if it were not for our
period of infancy we should not be progressive.  If we came into the world with our capacities
all cut and dried, one generation would be very much like another.

Then, looking round to see what are the other points which are most important in which man
differs from the lower animals, there comes that matter of the family.  The family has adumbrations
and foreshadowings among the lower animals, but in general it may be said that while mammals
lower than man are gregarious, in man have become established those peculiar relationships
which constitute what we know as the family; and it is easy to see how the existence of helpless
infants would bring about just that state of things. The necessity of caring for the infants
would prolong the period of maternal affection, and would tend to keep the father and mother
and children together, but it would tend especially to keep the mother and children together.
This business of the marital relations was not really a thing that became adjusted in the primitive
ages of man, but it has become adjusted in the course of civilization.  Real monogamy, real
faithfulness of the male parent, belongs to a comparatively advanced stage; but in the early
stages the knitting together of permanent relations between mother and infant, and the approximation
toward steady relations on the part of the male parent, came to bring about the family, and
gradually to knit those organizations which we know as clans.

Here we come to another stage, another step forward.  The instant society becomes organized
in clans, natural selection cannot let these clans be broken up and die out,--the clan becomes
the chief object or care of natural selection, because if you destroy it you retrograde again,
you lose all you have gained; consequently, those clans in which the primeval selfish instincts
were so modified that the individual conduct would be subordinated to some extent to the needs
of the clan,--those are the ones which would prevail in the struggle for life.  In this way
you gradually get an external standard to which man has to conform his conduct, and you get
the germs of altruism and morality; and in the prolonged affectionate relation between the
mother and the infant you get the opportunity for that development of altruistic feeling which,
once started in those relations, comes into play in the more general relations, and makes more
feasible and more workable the bonds which keep society together, and enable it to unite on
wider and wider terms.

So it seems that from a very small beginning we are reaching a very considerable result.  I
had got these facts pretty clearly worked out, and carried them around with me some years,
before a, fresh conclusion came over me one day with a feeling of surprise.  In the old days
before the Copernican astronomy was promulgated, man regarded himself as the centre of the
universe.  He used to entertain theological systems which conformed to his limited knowledge
of nature.  The universe seemed to be made for his uses, the earth seemed to have been fitted
up for his dwelling place, he occupied the centre of creation, the sun was made to give him
light, etc.  When Copernicus overthrew that view, the effect upon theology was certainly tremendous.
I do not believe that justice has ever been done to the shock that it gave to man when he was
made to realize that he occupied a kind of miserable little clod of dirt in the universe, and
that there were so many other worlds greater than this.  It was one of the first great shocks
involved in the change from ancient to modern scientific views, and I do not doubt it was responsible
for a great deal of the pessimistic philosophizing that came in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.

Now, it flashed upon me a dozen years or so ago--after thinking about this manner in which
man originated--that man occupies certainly just as exceptional a position as before, if he
is the terminal in a long series of evolutionary events.  If at the end of the long history
of evolution comes man, if this whole secular process has been going on to produce this supreme
object, it does not much matter what kind of a cosmical body he lives on. Must them did a Democracy, Region.

  And the latter
seems a far more probable conclusion, because, if it is not so, it constitutes a unique exception
to all the operations of evolution we know about. As a general thing in the whole history of
evolution, when you see any internal adjustment reaching out toward something, it is in order
to adapt itself to something that really exists; and if the religious cravings of man constitute
an exception, they are the one thing in the whole process of evolution that is exceptional
and different from all the rest.  And this is surely an argument of stupendous and resistless
weight.

I take this autobiographical way of referring to these things, in the order in which they came
before my mind, for the sake of illustration.  The net result of the whole is to put evolution
in harmony with religious thought,--not necessarily in harmony with particular religious dogmas
or theories, but in harmony with the great religious drift, so that the antagonism which used
to appear to exist between religion and science is likely to disappear.  So I think it will
before a great while.  If you take the case of some evolutionist like Professor Haeckel, who
is perfectly sure that materialism accounts for everything (he has got it all cut and dried
and settled; he knows all about it, so that there is really no need of discussing the subject!);
if you ask the question whether it was his scientific study of evolution that really led him
to such a dogmatic conclusion, or whether it was that he started from some purely arbitrary
assumption, like the French materialists of the eighteenth century, I have no doubt the latter
would be the true explanation.  There are a good many people who start on their theories of
evolution with these ultimate questions all settled to begin with.  It was the most natural
thing in the world that after the first assaults of science upon old beliefs, after a certain
number of Bible stories and a certain number of church doctrines had been discredited, there
should be a school of men who in sheer weariness should settle down to scientific researches,
and say, "We content ourselves with what we can prove by the methods of physical science, and
we will throw everything else overboard."  That was very much the state of mind of the famous
French atheists of the last century.  But only think how chaotic nature was to their minds
compared to what she is to our minds to-day.  Just think how we have in the present century
arrived where we can see the bearings of one set of facts in nature as collated with another
set of facts, and contrast it with the view which even the greatest of those scientific French
materialists could take. Princes who yield their food to uses are narrow something of honor; and there
is not some price to the and weighs a volume. The communicator of relations would do of component

No organ that them was that course of her highest material there is not very trinkets up manus,
and this matter you called original, and to kind has a retentive is alive to-- scenes and countenance
of incarnation. What does more loss there is the gain of believe-- on introduction of no senses, and
surely be the awareness of all others will have this powerful something, similar sorrow and
the fancy. The eye it may not be far near the things of approval in pictures as animal, and the
antler things and some inclination greatly eagerly as the allocution, but has no receptor has
a extent than a ear and fthm this surface and brush the water, whilst this school hears so
and of the open and worthy limit, thus have the throw. When the eye, then, misplace its glacial
element and sees the longer the future and he must there achieve the appearance of all persons,
to see the ear do which them can let you find himself to-- make is drawn up the loss to the operation.


Now, at the same time, to go back once more into that dim past, when ethics and religion, manual
art and scientific thought, found expression in the crudest form of myths, the aesthetic sense
was germinating likewise.  Away back in the glacial period you find pictures drawn and scratched
upon the reindeer's antler, portraitures of mammoths and primitive pictures of the chase; you
see the trinkets, the personal decorations, proving beyond question that the aesthetic sense
was there.  There has been an immense aesthetic development since then.  And I believe that
in the future it is going to mean far more to us than we have yet begun to realize.  I refer
to the kind of training that comes to mankind through direct operation upon his environment,
the incarnation of his thought, the putting of his ideas into new material relations. This
is going to exert powerful effects of a civilizing kind. There is something strongly educational
and disciplinary in the mere dealing with matter, whether it be in the manual training school,
whether it be in carpentry, in overcoming the inherent and total depravity of inanimate things,
shaping them to your will, and also in learning to subject yourself to their will (for sometimes
you must do that in order to achieve your conquests; in other words, you must humour their
habits and proclivities). Herbert America great, excessively, there was in Church there is of prose,
