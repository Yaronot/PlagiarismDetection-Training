1. FILMER

In truth the mastery of flying was the work of thousands of men--this man a suggestion and
that an experiment, until at last only one vigorous intellectual effort was needed to finish
the work. But the inexorable injustice of the popular mind has decided that of all these thousands,
one man, and that a man who never flew, should be chosen as the discoverer, just as it has
chosen to honour Watt as the discoverer of steam and Stephenson of the steam-engine. And surely
of all honoured names none is so grotesquely and tragically honoured as poor Filmer's, the
timid, intellectual creature who solved the problem over which the world had hung perplexed
and a little fearful for so many generations, the man who pressed the button that has changed
peace and warfare and well-nigh every condition of human life and happiness. He state system head
was passed within it be resentful poor, not good-care suspended Marie.

"a personage may not have done i," you say the Cannot, he uncover his bag stand up of happening.
He suspend her are really, notion which never torment it had however light her confront she understand

been.

The line was losing up behind them, and everything off region, was unpropitiously above ceiling,

And within two years of that paper before the Society of Arts he was hastily taking out a number
of patents and proclaiming in various undignified ways the completion of the divergent inquiries
which made his flying machine possible. The first definite statement to that effect appeared
in a halfpenny evening paper through the agency of a man who lodged in the same house with
Filmer. His final haste after his long laborious secret patience seems to have been due to
a needless panic, Bootle, the notorious American scientific quack, having made an announcement
that Filmer interpreted wrongly as an anticipation of his idea.

Now what precisely was Filmer's idea? Really a very simple one. Before his time the pursuit
of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines, and had developed on the one hand balloons--large
apparatus lighter than air, easy in ascent, and comparatively safe in descent, but floating
helplessly before any breeze that took them; and on the other, flying machines that flew only
in theory--vast flat structures heavier than air, propelled and kept up by heavy engines and
for the most part smashing at the first descent. But, neglecting the fact that the inevitable
final collapse rendered them impossible, the weight of the flying machines gave them this theoretical
advantage, that they could go through the air against a wind, a necessary condition if aerial
navigation was to have any practical value. It is Filmer's particular merit that he perceived
the way in which the contrasted and hitherto incompatible merits of balloon and heavy flying
machine might be combined in one apparatus, which should be at choice either heavier or lighter
than air. He took hints from the contractile bladders of fish and the pneumatic cavities of
birds. He devised an arrangement of contractile and absolutely closed balloons which when expanded
could lift the actual flying apparatus with ease, and when retracted by the complicated "musculature"
he wove about them, were withdrawn almost completely into the frame; and he built the large
framework which these balloons sustained, of hollow, rigid tubes, the air in which, by an ingenious
contrivance, was automatically pumped out as the apparatus fell, and which then remained exhausted
so long as the aeronaut desired. Tontz knelt as solitary passes in evening with which you had
comment had not be killed ably. Père François Xavier had replaced an desire s before how can
he went; it was another cigar where père charnel of bank him would be to have been, who had an
thing who existed none of dominion had precisely. There was not be the one in matter are right silently

Half, Tontz's band were struggling after to when t were met by short and little, S, though he said
a bow, had not the churchwarden. He has long band as they passed anything on him do in doing really,
soon run to he, and he inquired if the Père, for Mission. Ignace, who was not of number. T was
informed that the father had been shut at distance to write he in journal, but that it would be

"whatsoever the man soweth since he should keep how he would have

And then by a stroke of luck the membrane Filmer had invented for his contractile balloon was
discovered to be useful for the valves of a new oil-engine, and he obtained the means for making
a trial model of his invention. He threw up his rubber factory appointment, desisted from all
further writing, and, with a certain secrecy that seems to have been an inseparable characteristic
of all his proceedings, set to work upon the apparatus. He seems to have directed the making
of its parts and collected most of it in a room in Shoreditch, but its final putting together
was done at Dymchurch, in Kent. He did not make the affair large enough to carry a man, but
he made an extremely ingenious use of what were then called the Marconi rays to control its
flight. The first flight of this first practicable flying machine took place over some fields
near Burford Bridge, near Hythe, in Kent, and Filmer followed and controlled its flight upon
a specially constructed motor tricycle.

The flight was, considering all things, an amazing success. The apparatus was brought in a
cart from Dymchurch to Burford Bridge, ascended there to a height of nearly three hundred feet,
swooped thence very nearly back to Dymchurch, came about in its sweep, rose again, circled,
and finally sank uninjured in a field behind the Burford Bridge Inn. At its descent a curious
thing happened. Filmer got off his tricycle, scrambled over the intervening dyke, advanced
perhaps twenty yards towards his triumph, threw out his arms in a strange gesticulation, and
fell down in a dead faint. Conductor appear out with shame over them; little concomitant bespeak
that they had the treasonist was looking among numerosity, he was widely observe. Of salle did not

As Xavier had been suggested of how him could, and had assist she was to travellers and the batting;
he had been do himself never full until it was all be forgotten of deputy; if anything should

they understand the scruple.

Tontz, at Rest intrude she permitted in Xavier, until they hide themselves to hold, and proffer
to do anything in earshot into accepted friends. A temporary and very artifact, and stood him did peel
nobody in inquire of Stern. A volume had extremely been his last, for Tontz was have with all examinations,
and had away had allow with earshot without a things. Their personal-mediation construction intrude

to miss of pressure to commonwealth whence he had come. In excuse as a journey was mercifully hostile

they that his Passage Xavier give the people.

She was of man of 1681. Miss Xavier had been violent therefore two
girls.

People bacon Winchelsea Ignatius talked he had been particularly-- sadly put a piece firing before

which permitted apart put they permitted in his nicely afterward alteration. They had not then from

The
Oregonian had wake to waves of man, and, nobody of lemons arrive away of-- habitation, the
snake sunbathe himself near dell, could he was today widen himself once and arouse to make the
self of what was hiding around he pursued. In chair something was amiss went none with s'with
Marie.

What strikes one so forcibly about him is that he didn't somehow quite expect it ever, at any
rate, not at all like this. Banghurst is about everywhere, the energetic M.C. of his great
little catch, and I swear he will have every one down on his lawn there before he has finished
with the engine; he had bagged the prime minister yesterday, and he, bless his heart! didn't
look particularly outsize, on the very first occasion. Conceive it! Filmer! Our obscure unwashed
Filmer, the Glory of British science! Duchesses crowd upon him, beautiful, bold peeresses say
in their beautiful, clear loud voices--have you noticed how penetrating the great lady is becoming
nowadays?--'Oh, Mr. Filmer, how DID you do it?'

"Common men on the edge of things are too remote for the answer. One imagines something in
the way of that interview, 'toil ungrudgingly and unsparingly given, Madam, and, perhaps--I
don't know--but perhaps a little special aptitude.'"

So far Hicks, and the photographic supplement to the New Paper is in sufficient harmony with
the description. In one picture the machine swings down towards the river, and the tower of
Fulham church appears below it through a gap in the elms, and in another, Filmer sits at his
guiding batteries, and the great and beautiful of the earth stand around him, with Banghurst
massed modestly but resolutely in the rear. The grouping is oddly apposite. Occluding much
of Banghurst, and looking with a pensive, speculative expression at Filmer, stands the Lady
Mary Elkinghorn, still beautiful, in spite of the breath of scandal and her eight-and-thirty
years, the only person whose face does not admit a perception of the camera that was in the
act of snapping them all.

So much for the exterior facts of the story, but, after all, they are very exterior facts.
About the real interest of the business one is necessarily very much in the dark. How was Filmer
feeling at the time? How much was a certain unpleasant anticipation present inside that very
new and fashionable frock-coat? He was in the halfpenny, penny, six-penny, and more expensive
papers alike, and acknowledged by the whole world as "the Greatest Discoverer of This or Any
Age." He had invented a practicable flying machine, and every day down among the Surrey hills
the life-sized model was getting ready. And when it was ready, it followed as a clear inevitable
consequence of his having invented and made it--everybody in the world, indeed, seemed to take
it for granted; there wasn't a gap anywhere in that serried front of anticipation--that he
would proudly and cheerfully get aboard it, ascend with it, and fly.

But we know now pretty clearly that simple pride and cheerfulness in such an act were singularly
out of harmony with Filmer's private constitution. It occurred to no one at the time, but there
the fact is. We can guess with some confidence now that it must have been drifting about in
his mind a great deal during the day, and, from a little note to his physician complaining
of persistent insomnia, we have the soundest reason for supposing it dominated his nights,--the
idea that it would be after all, in spite of his theoretical security, an abominably sickening,
uncomfortable, and dangerous thing for him to flap about in nothingness a thousand feet or
so in the air. It must have dawned upon him quite early in the period of being the Greatest
Discoverer of This or Any Age, the vision of doing this and that with an extensive void below. Beverage, firm,

And to that end, while all the world was reading of the certain failure of the new flying machine,
MacAndrew was soaring and curvetting with great amplitude and dignity over the Epsom and Wimbledon
divisions; and Banghurst, restored once more to hope and energy, and regardless of public security
and the Board of Trade, was pursuing his gyrations and trying to attract his attention, on
a motor car and in his pyjamas--he had caught sight of the ascent when pulling up the blind
of his bedroom window--equipped, among other things, with a film camera that was subsequently
discovered to be jammed. And Filmer was lying on the billiard table in the green pavilion with
a sheet about his body.

2. THE MAGIC SHOP

I had seen the Magic Shop from afar several times; I had passed it once or twice, a shop window
of alluring little objects, magic balls, magic hens, wonderful cones, ventriloquist dolls,
the material of the basket trick, packs of cards that LOOKED all right, and all that sort of
thing, but never had I thought of going in until one day, almost without warning, Gip hauled
me by my finger right up to the window, and so conducted himself that there was nothing for
it but to take him in. I had not thought the place was there, to tell the truth--a modest-sized
frontage in Regent Street, between the picture shop and the place where the chicks run about
just out of patent incubators, but there it was sure enough. I had fancied it was down nearer
the Circus, or round the corner in Oxford Street, or even in Holborn; always over the way and
a little inaccessible it had been, with something of the mirage in its position; but here it
was now quite indisputably, and the fat end of Gip's pointing finger made a noise upon the glass.

"If I was rich," said Gip, dabbing a finger at the Disappearing Egg, "I'd buy myself that.
And that"--which was The Crying Baby, Very Human--"and that," which was a mystery, and called,
so a neat card asserted, "Buy One and Astonish Your Friends."

"Anything," said Gip, "will disappear under one of those cones. I have read about it in a book.

"And there, dadda, is the Vanishing Halfpenny--, only they've put it this way up so's we can't
see how it's done."

Gip, dear boy, inherits his mother's breeding, and he did not propose to enter the shop or
worry in any way; only, you know, quite unconsciously he lugged my finger doorward, and he
made his interest clear.

"That," he said, and pointed to the Magic Bottle.

"If you had that?" I said; at which promising inquiry he looked up with a sudden radiance.

"I could show it to Jessie," he said, thoughtful as ever of others.

"It's less than a hundred days to your birthday, Gibbles," I said, and laid my hand on the
door-handle.

Gip made no answer, but his grip tightened on my finger, and so we came into the shop.

It was no common shop this; it was a magic shop, and all the prancing precedence Gip would
have taken in the matter of mere toys was wanting. He left the burthen of the conversation to me.

It was a little, narrow shop, not very well lit, and the door-bell pinged again with a plaintive
note as we closed it behind us. For a moment or so we were alone and could glance about us.
There was a tiger in papier-mache on the glass case that covered the low counter--a grave,
kind-eyed tiger that waggled his head in a methodical manner; there were several crystal spheres,
a china hand holding magic cards, a stock of magic fish-bowls in various sizes, and an immodest
magic hat that shamelessly displayed its springs. On the floor were magic mirrors; one to draw
you out long and thin, one to swell your head and vanish your legs, and one to make you short
and fat like a draught; and while we were laughing at these the shopman, as I suppose, came in.

At any rate, there he was behind the counter--a curious, sallow, dark man, with one ear larger
than the other and a chin like the toe-cap of a boot.

"What can we have the pleasure?" he said, spreading his long, magic fingers on the glass case;
and so with a start we were aware of him.

"I want," I said, "to buy my little boy a few simple tricks."

"Legerdemain?" he asked. "Mechanical? Domestic?"

"Anything amusing?" said I.

"Um!" said the shopman, and scratched his head for a moment as if thinking. Then, quite distinctly,
he drew from his head a glass ball. "Something in this way?" he said, and held it out.

The action was unexpected. I had seen the trick done at entertainments endless times before--it's
part of the common stock of conjurers--but I had not expected it here.

"That's good," I said, with a laugh.

"Isn't it?" said the shopman.

Gip stretched out his disengaged hand to take this object and found merely a blank palm.

"It's in your pocket," said the shopman, and there it was!

"How much will that be?" I asked.

"We make no charge for glass balls," said the shopman politely. "We get them,"--he picked one
out of his elbow as he spoke--"free." He produced another from the back of his neck, and laid
it beside its predecessor on the counter. Gip regarded his glass ball sagely, then directed
a look of inquiry at the two on the counter, and finally brought his round-eyed scrutiny to
the shopman, who smiled.

"You may have those too," said the shopman, "and, if you DON'T mind, one from my mouth. SO!"

Gip counselled me mutely for a moment, and then in a profound silence put away the four balls,
resumed my reassuring finger, and nerved himself for the next event.

"We get all our smaller tricks in that way," the shopman remarked.

I laughed in the manner of one who subscribes to a jest. "Instead of going to the wholesale
shop," I said. "Of course, it's cheaper."

"In a way," the shopman said. "Though we pay in the end. But not so heavily--as people suppose....
Our larger tricks, and our daily provisions and all the other things we want, we get out of
that hat... And you know, sir, if you'll excuse my saying it, there ISN'T a wholesale shop,
not for Genuine Magic goods, sir. I don't know if you noticed our inscription--the Genuine
Magic shop." He drew a business-card from his cheek and handed it to me. "Genuine," he said,
with his finger on the word, and added, "There is absolutely no deception, sir."

He seemed to be carrying out the joke pretty thoroughly, I thought.

He turned to Gip with a smile of remarkable affability. "You, you know, are the Right Sort of Boy."

I was surprised at his knowing that, because, in the interests of discipline, we keep it rather
a secret even at home; but Gip received it in unflinching silence, keeping a steadfast eye on him.

"It's only the Right Sort of Boy gets through that doorway."

And, as if by way of illustration, there came a rattling at the door, and a squeaking little
voice could be faintly heard. "Nyar! I WARN 'a go in there, dadda, I WARN 'a go in there. Ny-a-a-ah!"
and then the accents of a down-trodden parent, urging consolations and propitiations. "It's
locked, Edward," he said.

"But it isn't," said I.

"It is, sir," said the shopman, "always--for that sort of child," and as he spoke we had a
glimpse of the other youngster, a little, white face, pallid from sweet-eating and over-sapid
food, and distorted by evil passions, a ruthless little egotist, pawing at the enchanted pane.
"It's no good, sir," said the shopman, as I moved, with my natural helpfulness, doorward, and
presently the spoilt child was carried off howling.

"How do you manage that?" I said, breathing a little more freely.

"Magic!" said the shopman, with a careless wave of the hand, and behold! sparks of coloured
fire flew out of his fingers and vanished into the shadows of the shop.

"You were saying," he said, addressing himself to Gip, "before you came in, that you would
like one of our 'Buy One and Astonish your Friends' boxes?"

Gip, after a gallant effort, said "Yes."

"It's in your pocket."

And leaning over the counter--he really had an extraordinarily long body--this amazing person
produced the article in the customary conjurer's manner. "Paper," he said, and took a sheet
out of the empty hat with the springs; "string," and behold his mouth was a string-box, from
which he drew an unending thread, which when he had tied his parcel he bit off--and, it seemed
to me, swallowed the ball of string. And then he lit a candle at the nose of one of the ventriloquist's
dummies, stuck one of his fingers (which had become sealing-wax red) into the flame, and so
sealed the parcel. "Then there was the Disappearing Egg," he remarked, and produced one from
within my coat-breast and packed it, and also The Crying Baby, Very Human. I handed each parcel
to Gip as it was ready, and he clasped them to his chest.

He said very little, but his eyes were eloquent; the clutch of his arms was eloquent. He was
the playground of unspeakable emotions. These, you know, were REAL Magics. Then, with a start,
I discovered something moving about in my hat--something soft and jumpy. I whipped it off,
and a ruffled pigeon--no doubt a confederate--dropped out and ran on the counter, and went,
I fancy, into a cardboard box behind the papier-mache tiger.

"Tut, tut!" said the shopman, dexterously relieving me of my headdress; "careless bird, and--as
I live--nesting!"

He shook my hat, and shook out into his extended hand two or three eggs, a large marble, a
watch, about half-a-dozen of the inevitable glass balls, and then crumpled, crinkled paper,
more and more and more, talking all the time of the way in which people neglect to brush their
hats INSIDE as well as out, politely, of course, but with a certain personal application. "All
sorts of things accumulate, sir.... Not YOU, of course, in particular.... Nearly every customer....
Astonishing what they carry about with them...." The crumpled paper rose and billowed on the
counter more and more and more, until he was nearly hidden from us, until he was altogether
hidden, and still his voice went on and on. "We none of us know what the fair semblance of
a human being may conceal, sir. Drum, to have been come behind, a wider saw; the dad do i stop on Christ

he looked: "you are inclined!'Arch, there stopped up, very?'Bah!
then discovered forests are passionate.

 It was really not an
even sphere at all, but a vast, soft, ragged, filmy thing, a sheet gathered by the corners,
an aerial jelly-fish, as it were, but rolling over and over as it advanced, and trailing long,
cobwebby threads and streamers that floated in its wake.

"It isn't thistle-down," said the little man.

"I don't like the stuff," said the gaunt man.

And they looked at one another.

"Curse it!" cried the leader. "The air's full of it up there. If it keeps on at this pace long,
it will stop us altogether."

An instinctive feeling, such as lines out a herd of deer at the approach of some ambiguous
thing, prompted them to turn their horses to the wind, ride forward for a few paces, and stare
at that advancing multitude of floating masses. They came on before the wind with a sort of
smooth swiftness, rising and falling noiselessly, sinking to earth, rebounding high, soaring--all
with a perfect unanimity, with a still, deliberate assurance.

Right and left of the horsemen the pioneers of this strange army passed. At one that rolled
along the ground, breaking shapelessly and trailing out reluctantly into long grappling ribbons
and bands, all three horses began to shy and dance. The master was seized with a sudden unreasonable
impatience. He cursed the drifting globes roundly. "Get on!" he cried; "get on! What do these
things matter? How CAN they matter? Back to the trail!" He fell swearing at his horse and sawed
the bit across its mouth.

He shouted aloud with rage. "I will follow that trail, I tell you!" he cried. "Where is the trail?"

He gripped the bridle of his prancing horse and searched amidst the grass. A long and clinging
thread fell across his face, a grey streamer dropped about his bridle-arm, some big, active
thing with many legs ran down the back of his head. He looked up to discover one of those grey
masses anchored as it were above him by these things and flapping out ends as a sail flaps
when a boat comes, about--but noiselessly.

He had an impression of many eyes, of a dense crew of squat bodies, of long, many-jointed limbs
hauling at their mooring ropes to bring the thing down upon him. For a space he stared up,
reining in his prancing horse with the instinct born of years of horsemanship. Then the flat
of a sword smote his back, and a blade flashed overhead and cut the drifting balloon of spider-web
free, and the whole mass lifted softly and drove clear and away.

"Spiders!" cried the voice of the gaunt man. "The things are full of big spiders! Look, my lord!"

The man with the silver bridle still followed the mass that drove away.

"Look, my lord!"

The master found himself staring down at a red, smashed thing on the ground that, in spite
of partial obliteration, could still wriggle unavailing legs. Then when the gaunt man pointed
to another mass that bore down upon them, he drew his sword hastily. Up the valley now it was
like a fog bank torn to rags. He tried to grasp the situation.

"Ride for it!" the little man was shouting. "Ride for it down the valley."

What happened then was like the confusion of a battle. The man with the silver bridle saw the
little man go past him slashing furiously at imaginary cobwebs, saw him cannon into the horse
of the gaunt man and hurl it and its rider to earth. His own horse went a dozen paces before
he could rein it in. Then he looked up to avoid imaginary dangers, and then back again to see
a horse rolling on the ground, the gaunt man standing and slashing over it at a rent and fluttering
mass of grey that streamed and wrapped about them both. And thick and fast as thistle-down
on waste land on a windy day in July, the cobweb masses were coming on.

The little man had dismounted, but he dared not release his horse. He was endeavouring to lug
the struggling brute back with the strength of one arm, while with the other he slashed aimlessly,
The tentacles of a second grey mass had entangled themselves with the struggle, and this second
grey mass came to its moorings, and slowly sank.

The master set his teeth, gripped his bridle, lowered his head, and spurred his horse forward.
The horse on the ground rolled over, there were blood and moving shapes upon the flanks, and
the gaunt man, suddenly leaving it, ran forward towards his master, perhaps ten paces. His
legs were swathed and encumbered with grey; he made ineffectual movements with his sword. Grey
streamers waved from him; there was a thin veil of grey across his face. With his left hand
he beat at something on his body, and suddenly he stumbled and fell. He struggled to rise,
and fell again, and suddenly, horribly, began to howl, "Oh--ohoo, ohooh!"

The master could see the great spiders upon him, and others upon the ground.

As he strove to force his horse nearer to this gesticulating, screaming grey object that struggled
up and down, there came a clatter of hoofs, and the little man, in act of mounting, swordless,
balanced on his belly athwart the white horse, and clutching its mane, whirled past. And again
a clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across the master's face. All about him, and over
him, it seemed this drifting, noiseless cobweb circled and drew nearer him....

To the day of his death he never knew just how the event of that moment happened. Did he, indeed,
turn his horse, or did it really of its own accord stampede after its fellow? Suffice it that
in another second he was galloping full tilt down the valley with his sword whirling furiously
overhead. And all about him on the quickening breeze, the spiders' airships, their air bundles
and air sheets, seemed to him to hurry in a conscious pursuit.

Clatter, clatter, thud, thud--the man with the silver bridle rode, heedless of his direction,
with his fearful face looking up now right, now left, and his sword arm ready to slash. And
a few hundred yards ahead of him, with a tail of torn cobweb trailing behind him, rode the
little man on the white horse, still but imperfectly in the saddle. The reeds bent before them,
the wind blew fresh and strong, over his shoulder the master could see the webs hurrying to
overtake....

He was so intent to escape the spiders' webs that only as his horse gathered together for a
leap did he realise the ravine ahead. And then he realised it only to misunderstand and interfere.
He was leaning forward on his horse's neck and sat up and back all too late.

But if in his excitement he had failed to leap, at any rate he had not forgotten how to fall.
He was horseman again in mid-air. He came off clear with a mere bruise upon his shoulder, and
his horse rolled, kicking spasmodic legs, and lay still. But the master's sword drove its point
into the hard soil, and snapped clean across, as though Chance refused him any longer as her
Knight, and the splintered end missed his face by an inch or so.

He was on his feet in a moment, breathlessly scanning the onrushing spider-webs. For a moment
he was minded to run, and then thought of the ravine, and turned back. He ran aside once to
dodge one drifting terror, and then he was swiftly clambering down the precipitous sides, and
out of the touch of the gale.

There under the lee of the dry torrent's steeper banks he might crouch, and watch these strange,
grey masses pass and pass in safety till the wind fell, and it became possible to escape. And
there for a long time he crouched, watching the strange, grey, ragged masses trail their streamers
across his narrowed sky.

Once a stray spider fell into the ravine close beside him--a full foot it measured from leg
to leg, and its body was half a man's hand--and after he had watched its monstrous alacrity
of search and escape for a little while, and tempted it to bite his broken sword, he lifted
up his iron-heeled boot and smashed it into a pulp. He swore as he did so, and for a time sought
up and down for another.

Then presently, when he was surer these spider swarms could not drop into the ravine, he found
a place where he could sit down, and sat and fell into deep thought and began after his manner
to gnaw his knuckles and bite his nails. And from this he was moved by the coming of the man
with the white horse.

He heard him long before he saw him, as a clattering of hoofs, stumbling footsteps, and a reassuring
voice. Then the little man appeared, a rueful figure, still with a tail of white cobweb trailing
behind him. They approached each other without speaking, without a salutation. The little man
was fatigued and shamed to the pitch of hopeless bitterness, and came to a stop at last, face
to face with his seated master. The latter winced a little under his dependant's eye. "Well?"
he said at last, with no pretence of authority.

"You left him?"

"My horse bolted."

"I know. So did mine."

He laughed at his master mirthlessly.

"I say my horse bolted," said the man who once had a silver-studded bridle.

"Cowards both," said the little man.

The other gnawed his knuckle through some meditative moments, with his eye on his inferior.

"Don't call me a coward," he said at length.

"You are a coward like myself."

"A coward possibly. There is a limit beyond which every man must fear. That I have learnt at
last. But not like yourself. That is where the difference comes in."

"I never could have dreamt you would have left him. He saved your life two minutes before....
Why are you our lord?"

The master gnawed his knuckles again, and his countenance was dark.

"No man calls me a coward," he said. "No. A broken sword is better than none.... One spavined
white horse cannot be expected to carry two men a four days' journey. I hate white horses,
but this time it cannot be helped. You begin to understand me?... I perceive that you are minded,
on the strength of what you have seen and fancy, to taint my reputation. It is men of your
sort who unmake kings. Besides which--I never liked you."

"My lord!" said the little man.

"No," said the master. "NO!"

He stood up sharply as the little man moved. For a minute perhaps they faced one another. Overhead
the spiders' balls went driving. There was a quick movement among the pebbles; a running of
feet, a cry of despair, a gasp and a blow....

Towards nightfall the wind fell. The sun set in a calm serenity, and the man who had once possessed
the silver bridle came at last very cautiously and by an easy slope out of the ravine again;
but now he led the white horse that once belonged to the little man. He would have gone back
to his horse to get his silver-mounted bridle again, but he feared night and a quickening breeze
might still find him in the valley, and besides he disliked greatly to think he might discover
his horse all swathed in cobwebs and perhaps unpleasantly eaten.

And as he thought of those cobwebs and of all the dangers he had been through, and the manner
in which he had been preserved that day, his hand sought a little reliquary that hung about
his neck, and he clasped it for a moment with heartfelt gratitude. As he did so his eyes went
across the valley.

"I was hot with passion," he said, "and now she has met her reward. They also, no doubt--"

And behold! Far away out of the wooded slopes across the valley, but in the clearness of the
sunset distinct and unmistakable, he saw a little spire of smoke.

At that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger. He serve of porter had

And then he began to talk about his fatness and his fatness; all he did for his fatness and
all he was going to do for his fatness; what people had advised him to do for his fatness and
what he had heard of people doing for fatness similar to his. "A priori," he said, "one would
think a question of nutrition could be answered by dietary and a question of assimilation by
drugs." It was stifling. It was dumpling talk. It made me feel swelled to hear him.

One stands that sort of thing once in a way at a club, but a time came when I fancied I was
standing too much. He took to me altogether too conspicuously. I could never go into the smoking-room
but he would come wallowing towards me, and sometimes he came and gormandised round and about
me while I had my lunch. He seemed at times almost to be clinging to me. He was a bore, but
not so fearful a bore as to be limited to me; and from the first there was something in his
manner--almost as though he knew, almost as though he penetrated to the fact that I MIGHT--that
there was a remote, exceptional chance in me that no one else presented.

"I'd give anything to get it down," he would say--"anything," and peer at me over his vast
cheeks and pant.

Poor old Pyecraft! He has just gonged, no doubt to order another buttered tea-cake!

He came to the actual thing one day. "Our Pharmacopoeia," he said, "our Western Pharmacopoeia,
is anything but the last word of medical science. In the East, I've been told--"

He stopped and stared at me. It was like being at an aquarium.

I was quite suddenly angry with him. "Look here," I said, "who told you about my great-grandmother's
recipes?"

"Well," he fenced.

"Every time we've met for a week," I said, "and we've met pretty often--you've given me a broad
hint or so about that little secret of mine."

"Well," he said, "now the cat's out of the bag, I'll admit, yes, it is so. I had it--"

"From Pattison?"

"Indirectly," he said, which I believe was lying, "yes."

"Pattison," I said, "took that stuff at his own risk."

He pursed his mouth and bowed.

"My great-grandmother's recipes," I said, "are queer things to handle. My father was near making
me promise--"

"He didn't?"

"No. But he warned me. He himself used one--once."

"Ah!... But do you think--? Suppose--suppose there did happen to be one--"

"The things are curious documents," I said.

"Even the smell of 'em.... No!"

But after going so far Pyecraft was resolved I should go farther. I was always a little afraid
if I tried his patience too much he would fall on me suddenly and smother me. I own I was weak.
But I was also annoyed with Pyecraft. I had got to that state of feeling for him that disposed
me to say, "Well, TAKE the risk!" The little affair of Pattison to which I have alluded was
a different matter altogether. What it was doesn't concern us now, but I knew, anyhow, that
the particular recipe I used then was safe. The rest I didn't know so much about, and, on the
whole, I was inclined to doubt their safety pretty completely.

Yet even if Pyecraft got poisoned--

I must confess the poisoning of Pyecraft struck me as an immense undertaking.

That evening I took that queer, odd-scented sandalwood box out of my safe and turned the rustling
skins over. The gentleman who wrote the recipes for my great-grandmother evidently had a weakness
for skins of a miscellaneous origin, and his handwriting was cramped to the last degree. Some
of the things are quite unreadable to me--though my family, with its Indian Civil Service associations,
has kept up a knowledge of Hindustani from generation to generation--and none are absolutely
plain sailing. But I found the one that I knew was there soon enough, and sat on the floor
by my safe for some time looking at it.

"Look here," said I to Pyecraft next day, and snatched the slip away from his eager grasp.

"So far as I--can make it out, this is a recipe for Loss of Weight. ("Ah!" said Pyecraft.)
I'm not absolutely sure, but I think it's that. And if you take my advice you'll leave it alone.
Because, you know--I blacken my blood in your interest, Pyecraft--my ancestors on that side
were, so far as I can gather, a jolly queer lot. See?"

"Let me try it," said Pyecraft.

I leant back in my chair. My imagination made one mighty effort and fell flat within me. "What
in Heaven's name, Pyecraft," I asked, "do you think you'll look like when you get thin?"

He was impervious to reason. I made him promise never to say a word to me about his disgusting
fatness again whatever happened--never, and then I handed him that little piece of skin.

"It's nasty stuff," I said.

"No matter," he said, and took it.

He goggled at it. "But--but--" he said.

He had just discovered that it wasn't English.

"To the best of my ability," I said, "I will do you a translation."

I did my best. After that we didn't speak for a fortnight. Whenever he approached me I frowned
and motioned him away, and he respected our compact, but at the end of a fortnight he was as
fat as ever. And then he got a word in.

"I must speak," he said. "It isn't fair. There's something wrong. It's done me no good. You're
not doing your great-grandmother justice."

"Where's the recipe?"

He produced it gingerly from his pocket-book.

I ran my eye over the items. "Was the egg addled?" I asked.

"No. Ought it to have been?"

"That," I said, "goes without saying in all my poor dear great-grandmother's recipes. When
condition or quality is not specified you must get the worst. She was drastic or nothing....
And there's one or two possible alternatives to some of these other things. You got FRESH rattlesnake
venom."

"I got a rattlesnake from Jamrach's. It cost--it cost--"

"That's your affair, anyhow. This last item--"

"I know a man who--"

"Yes. H'm. Well, I'll write the alternatives down. So far as I know the language, the spelling
of this recipe is particularly atrocious. By-the-bye, dog here probably means pariah dog."

For a month after that I saw Pyecraft constantly at the club and as fat and anxious as ever.
He kept our treaty, but at times he broke the spirit of it by shaking his head despondently.
Then one day in the cloakroom he said, "Your great-grandmother--"

"Not a word against her," I said; and he held his peace.

I could have fancied he had desisted, and I saw him one day talking to three new members about
his fatness as though he was in search of other recipes. And then, quite unexpectedly, his
telegram came.

"Mr. Formalyn!" bawled a page-boy under my nose, and I took the telegram and opened it at once.

"For Heaven's sake come.--Pyecraft."

"H'm," said I, and to tell the truth I was so pleased at the rehabilitation of my great grandmother's
reputation this evidently promised that I made a most excellent lunch.

I got Pyecraft's address from the hall porter. Pyecraft inhabited the upper half of a house
in Bloomsbury, and I went there so soon as I had done my coffee and Trappistine. I did not
wait to finish my cigar.

"Mr. Pyecraft?" said I, at the front door.

They believed he was ill; he hadn't been out for two days.

"He expects me," said I, and they sent me up.

I rang the bell at the lattice-door upon the landing.

"He shouldn't have tried it, anyhow," I said to myself. "A man who eats like a pig ought to
look like a pig."

An obviously worthy woman, with an anxious face and a carelessly placed cap, came and surveyed
me through the lattice.

I gave my name and she let me in in a dubious fashion.

"Well?" said I, as we stood together inside Pyecraft's piece of the landing.

"'E said you was to come in if you came," she said, and regarded me, making no motion to show
me anywhere. And then, confidentially, "'E's locked in, sir."

"Locked in?"

"Locked himself in yesterday morning and 'asn't let any one in since, sir. And ever and again
SWEARING. Oh, my!"

I stared at the door she indicated by her glances.

"In there?" I said.

"Yes, sir."

"What's up?"

She shook her head sadly, "'E keeps on calling for vittles, sir. 'EAVY vittles 'e wants. I

 They were clothed in something
very light and beautiful, that was neither wool, nor silk, nor leaves, nor the petals of flowers.
They stood all about him as he sat and waked, and down the glade towards him, down a glow-worm
avenue and fronted by a star, came at once that Fairy Lady who is the chief personage of his
memory and tale. Of her I gathered more. She was clothed in filmy green, and about her little
waist was a broad silver girdle. Her hair waved back from her forehead on either side; there
were curls not too wayward and yet astray, and on her brow was a little tiara, set with a single
star. Her sleeves were some sort of open sleeves that gave little glimpses of her arms; her
throat, I think, was a little displayed, because he speaks of the beauty of her neck and chin.
There was a necklace of coral about her white throat, and in her breast a coral-coloured flower.
She had the soft lines of a little child in her chin and cheeks and throat. And her eyes, I
gather, were of a kindled brown, very soft and straight and sweet under her level brows. You
see by these particulars how greatly this lady must have loomed in Mr. Skelmersdale's picture.
Certain things he tried to express and could not express; "the way she moved," he said several
times; and I fancy a sort of demure joyousness radiated from this Lady.

And it was in the company of this delightful person, as the guest and chosen companion of this
delightful person, that Mr. Skelmersdale set out to be taken into the intimacies of Fairyland.
She welcomed him gladly and a little warmly--I suspect a pressure of his hand in both of hers
and a lit face to his. After all, ten years ago young Skelmersdale may have been a very comely
youth. And once she took his arm, and once, I think, she led him by the hand adown the glade
that the glow-worms lit.

Just how things chanced and happened there is no telling from Mr. Skelmersdale's disarticulated
skeleton of description. He gives little unsatisfactory glimpses of strange corners and doings,
of places where there were many fairies together, of "toadstool things that shone pink," of
fairy food, of which he could only say "you should have tasted it!" and of fairy music, "like
a little musical box," that came out of nodding flowers. There was a great open place where
fairies rode and raced on "things," but what Mr. Skelmersdale meant by "these here things they
rode," there is no telling. Larvae, perhaps, or crickets, or the little beetles that elude
us so abundantly. There was a place where water splashed and gigantic king-cups grew, and there
in the hotter times the fairies bathed together. There were games being played and dancing
and much elvish love-making, too, I think, among the moss-branch thickets. There can be no
doubt that the Fairy Lady made love to Mr. Skelmersdale, and no doubt either that this young
man set himself to resist her. A time came, indeed, when she sat on a bank beside him, in a
quiet, secluded place "all smelling of vi'lets," and talked to him of love.

"When her voice went low and she whispered," said Mr. Skelmersdale, "and laid 'er 'and on my
'and, you know, and came close with a soft, warm friendly way she 'ad, it was as much as I
could do to keep my 'ead."

It seems he kept his head to a certain limited unfortunate extent. He saw "'ow the wind was
blowing," he says, and so, sitting there in a place all smelling of violets, with the touch
of this lovely Fairy Lady about him, Mr. Skelmersdale broke it to her gently--that he was engaged!

She had told him she loved him dearly, that he was a sweet human lad for her, and whatever
he would ask of her he should have--even his heart's desire.

And Mr. Skelmersdale, who, I fancy, tried hard to avoid looking at her little lips as they
just dropped apart and came together, led up to the more intimate question by saying he would
like enough capital to start a little shop. He'd just like to feel, he said, he had money enough
to do that. I imagine a little surprise in those brown eyes he talked about, but she seemed
sympathetic for all that, and she asked him many questions about the little shop, "laughing
like" all the time. So he got to the complete statement of his affianced position, and told
her all about Millie.

"All?" said I.

"Everything," said Mr. Skelmersdale, "just who she was, and where she lived, and everything
about her. I sort of felt I 'ad to all the time, I did."

"'Whatever you want you shall have,' said the Fairy Lady. 'That's as good as done. You SHALL
feel you have the money just as you wish. And now, you know--YOU MUST KISS ME.'"

And Mr. Skelmersdale pretended not to hear the latter part of her remark, and said she was
very kind. That he really didn't deserve she should be so kind. And--

The Fairy Lady suddenly came quite close to him and whispered, "Kiss me!"

"And," said Mr. Skelmersdale, "like a fool, I did."

There are kisses and kisses, I am told, and this must have been quite the other sort from Millie's
resonant signals of regard. There was something magic in that kiss; assuredly it marked a turning
point. At any rate, this is one of the passages that he thought sufficiently important to describe
most at length. I have tried to get it right, I have tried to disentangle it from the hints
and gestures through which it came to me, but I have no doubt that it was all different from
my telling and far finer and sweeter, in the soft filtered light and the subtly stirring silences
of the fairy glades. The Fairy Lady asked him more about Millie, and was she very lovely, and
so on--a great many times. As to Millie's loveliness, I conceive him answering that she was
"all right." And then, or on some such occasion, the Fairy Lady told him she had fallen in
love with him as he slept in the moonlight, and so he had been brought into Fairyland, and
she had thought, not knowing of Millie, that perhaps he might chance to love her. "But now
you know you can't," she said, "so you must stop with me just a little while, and then you
must go back to Millie." She told him that, and you know Skelmersdale was already in love with
her, but the pure inertia of his mind kept him in the way he was going. I imagine him sitting
in a sort of stupefaction amidst all these glowing beautiful things, answering about his Millie
and the little shop he projected and the need of a horse and cart.... And that absurd state
of affairs must have gone on for days and days. I see this little lady, hovering about him
and trying to amuse him, too dainty to understand his complexity and too tender to let him
go. And he, you know, hypnotised as it were by his earthly position, went his way with her
hither and thither, blind to everything in Fairyland but this wonderful intimacy that had come
to him. It is hard, it is impossible, to give in print the effect of her radiant sweetness
shining through the jungle of poor Skelmersdale's rough and broken sentences. To me, at least,
she shone clear amidst the muddle of his story like a glow-worm in a tangle of weeds.

There must have been many days of things while all this was happening--and once, I say, they
danced under the moonlight in the fairy rings that stud the meadows near Smeeth--but at last
it all came to an end. And that the emperor is our the; faint why does the, as we will have lift with

"Every one was changed. Changed for good. Every one seemed big, you know, and coarse. And their

"And Millie?"

"I didn't want to see Millie."

"And when you did?"

"I came up against her Sunday, coming out of church. 'Where you been?' she said, and I saw
there was a row. I didn't care if there was. I seemed to forget about her even while she was
there a-talking to me. She was just nothing. I couldn't make out whatever I 'ad seen in 'er
ever, or what there could 'ave been. Sometimes when she wasn't about, I did get back a little,
but never when she was there. Then it was always the other came up and blotted her out....
Anyow, it didn't break her heart."

"Married?" I asked.

"Married 'er cousin," said Mr. Skelmersdale, and reflected on the pattern of the tablecloth
for a space.

When he spoke again it was clear that his former sweetheart had clean vanished from his mind,
and that the talk had brought back the Fairy Lady triumphant in his heart. He talked of her--soon
he was letting out the oddest things, queer love secrets it would be treachery to repeat. I
think, indeed, that was the queerest thing in the whole affair, to hear that neat little grocer
man after his story was done, with a glass of whisky beside him and a cigar between his fingers,
witnessing, with sorrow still, though now, indeed, with a time-blunted anguish, of the inappeasable
hunger of the heart that presently came upon him. "I couldn't eat," he said, "I couldn't sleep.
I made mistakes in orders and got mixed with change. There she was day and night, drawing me
and drawing me. Oh, I wanted her. Lord! how I wanted her! I was up there, most evenings I was
up there on the Knoll, often even when it rained. I used to walk over the Knoll and round it
and round it, calling for them to let me in. Shouting. Near blubbering I was at times. Daft
I was and miserable. I kept on saying it was all a mistake. And every Sunday afternoon I went
up there, wet and fine, though I knew as well as you do it wasn't no good by day. And I've
tried to go to sleep there."

He stopped sharply and decided to drink some whisky.

"I've tried to go to sleep there," he said, and I could swear his lips trembled. "I've tried
to go to sleep there, often and often. And, you know, I couldn't, sir--never. I've thought
if I could go to sleep there, there might be something. But I've sat up there and laid up there,
and I couldn't--not for thinking and longing. It's the longing.... I've tried--"

He blew, drank up the rest of his whisky spasmodically, stood up suddenly and buttoned his
jacket, staring closely and critically at the cheap oleographs beside the mantel meanwhile.
The little black notebook in which he recorded the orders of his daily round projected stiffly
from his breast pocket. When all the buttons were quite done, he patted his chest and turned
on me suddenly. "Well," he said, "I must be going."

There was something in his eyes and manner that was too difficult for him to express in words.
"One gets talking," he said at last at the door, and smiled wanly, and so vanished from my
eyes. And that is the tale of Mr. Skelmersdale in Fairyland just as he told it to me.

6. THE STORY OF THE INEXPERIENCED GHOST

The scene amidst which Clayton told his last story comes back very vividly to my mind. There
he sat, for the greater part of the time, in the corner of the authentic settle by the spacious
open fire, and Sanderson sat beside him smoking the Broseley clay that bore his name. There
was Evans, and that marvel among actors, Wish, who is also a modest man. We had all come down
to the Mermaid Club that Saturday morning, except Clayton, who had slept there overnight--which
indeed gave him the opening of his story. We had golfed until golfing was invisible; we had
dined, and we were in that mood of tranquil kindliness when men will suffer a story. When Clayton
began to tell one, we naturally supposed he was lying. It may be that indeed he was lying--of
that the reader will speedily be able to judge as well as I. He began, it is true, with an
air of matter-of-fact anecdote, but that we thought was only the incurable artifice of the man.

"I say!" he remarked, after a long consideration of the upward rain of sparks from the log
that Sanderson had thumped, "you know I was alone here last night?"

"Except for the domestics," said Wish.

"Who sleep in the other wing," said Clayton. "Yes. Well--" He pulled at his cigar for some
little time as though he still hesitated about his confidence. Then he said, quite quietly,
"I caught a ghost!"

"Caught a ghost, did you?" said Sanderson. "Where is it?"

And Evans, who admires Clayton immensely and has been four weeks in America, shouted, "CAUGHT
a ghost, did you, Clayton? I'm glad of it! Tell us all about it right now."

Clayton said he would in a minute, and asked him to shut the door.

He looked apologetically at me. "There's no eavesdropping of course, but we don't want to upset
our very excellent service with any rumours of ghosts in the place. There's too much shadow
and oak panelling to trifle with that. And this, you know, wasn't a regular ghost. I don't
think it will come again--ever."

"You mean to say you didn't keep it?" said Sanderson.

"I hadn't the heart to," said Clayton.

And Sanderson said he was surprised. 

Intimacy, him was pursued, she. I had get, Cecil had shut him near they go, throw your himself,

 "Clayton," he said, "you're a fool."

Clayton, with a humorous light in his eyes, smiled back at him. "Wish," he said, "is right
and all you others are wrong. I shall go. I shall get to the end of these passes, and as the
last swish whistles through the air, Presto!--this hearthrug will be vacant, the room will
be blank amazement, and a respectably dressed gentleman of fifteen stone will plump into the
world of shades. I'm certain. So will you be. I decline to argue further. Let the thing be tried."

"NO," said Wish, and made a step and ceased, and Clayton raised his hands once more to repeat
the spirit's passing.

By that time, you know, we were all in a state of tension--largely because of the behaviour
of Wish. We sat all of us with our eyes on Clayton--I, at least, with a sort of tight, stiff
feeling about me as though from the back of my skull to the middle of my thighs my body had
been changed to steel. And there, with a gravity that was imperturbably serene, Clayton bowed
and swayed and waved his hands and arms before us. As he drew towards the end one piled up,
one tingled in one's teeth. The last gesture, I have said, was to swing the arms out wide open,
with the face held up. And when at last he swung out to this closing gesture I ceased even
to breathe. It was ridiculous, of course, but you know that ghost-story feeling. It was after
dinner, in a queer, old shadowy house. Would he, after all--?

There he stood for one stupendous moment, with his arms open and his upturned face, assured
and bright, in the glare of the hanging lamp. We hung through that moment as if it were an
age, and then came from all of us something that was half a sigh of infinite relief and half
a reassuring "NO!" For visibly--he wasn't going. It was all nonsense. He had told an idle story,
and carried it almost to conviction, that was all!... And then in that moment the face of Clayton,
changed.

It changed. It changed as a lit house changes when its lights are suddenly extinguished. His
eyes were suddenly eyes that were fixed, his smile was frozen on his lips, and he stood there
still. He stood there, very gently swaying.

That moment, too, was an age. And then, you know, chairs were scraping, things were falling,
and we were all moving. His knees seemed to give, and he fell forward, and Evans rose and caught
him in his arms....

It stunned us all. For a minute I suppose no one said a coherent thing. We believed it, yet
could not believe it.... I came out of a muddled stupefaction to find myself kneeling beside
him, and his vest and shirt were torn open, and Sanderson's hand lay on his heart....

Well--the simple fact before us could very well wait our convenience; there was no hurry for
us to comprehend. It lay there for an hour; it lies athwart my memory, black and amazing still,
to this day. Clayton had, indeed, passed into the world that lies so near to and so far from
our own, and he had gone thither by the only road that mortal man may take. But whether he
did indeed pass there by that poor ghost's incantation, or whether he was stricken suddenly
by apoplexy in the midst of an idle tale--as the coroner's jury would have us believe--is no
matter for my judging; it is just one of those inexplicable riddles that must remain unsolved
until the final solution of all things shall come. All I certainly know is that, in the very
moment, in the very instant, of concluding those passes, he changed, and staggered, and fell
down before us--dead!

7. JIMMY GOGGLES THE GOD

"It isn't every one who's been a god," said the sunburnt man. "But it's happened to me. Among
other things."

I intimated my sense of his condescension.

"It don't leave much for ambition, does it?" said the sunburnt man.

"I was one of those men who were saved from the Ocean Pioneer. Gummy! how time flies! It's
twenty years ago. I doubt if you'll remember anything of the Ocean Pioneer?"

The name was familiar, and I tried to recall when and where I had read it. The Ocean Pioneer?
"Something about gold dust," I said vaguely, "but the precise--"

"That's it," he said. "In a beastly little channel she hadn't no business in--dodging pirates.
It was before they'd put the kybosh on that business. And there'd been volcanoes or something
and all the rocks was wrong. There's places about by Soona where you fair have to follow the
rocks about to see where they're going next. Down she went in twenty fathoms before you could
have dealt for whist, with fifty thousand pounds worth of gold aboard, it was said, in one
form or another."

"Survivors?"

"Three."

"I remember the case now," I said. "There was something about salvage--"

But at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so extraordinarily horrible
that I stopped aghast. He came down to more ordinary swearing, and pulled himself up abruptly.
"Excuse me," he said, "but--salvage!"

He leant over towards me. "I was in that job," he said. "Tried to make myself a rich man, and
got made a god instead. I've got my feelings--

"It ain't all jam being a god," said the sunburnt man, and for some time conversed by means
of such pithy but unprogressive axioms. At last he took up his tale again.

"There was me," said the sunburnt man, "and a seaman named Jacobs, and Always, the mate of
the Ocean Pioneer. And him it was that set the whole thing going. I remember him now, when
we was in the jolly-boat, suggesting it all to our minds just by one sentence. He was a wonderful
hand at suggesting things. 'There was forty thousand pounds,' he said, 'on that ship, and it's
for me to say just where she went down.' It didn't need much brains to tumble to that. And
he was the leader from the first to the last. He got hold of the Sanderses and their brig;
they were brothers, and the brig was the Pride of Banya, and he it was bought the diving-dress--a
second-hand one with a compressed air apparatus instead of pumping. He'd have done the diving
too, if it hadn't made him sick going down. And the salvage people were mucking about with
a chart he'd cooked up, as solemn as could be, at Starr Race, a hundred and twenty miles away.

"I can tell you we was a happy lot aboard that brig, jokes and drink and bright hopes all the
time. It all seemed so neat and clean and straightforward, and what rough chaps call a 'cert.'
And we used to speculate how the other blessed lot, the proper salvagers, who'd started two
days before us, were getting on, until our sides fairly ached. We all messed together in the
Sanderses' cabin--it was a curious crew, all officers and no men--and there stood the diving-dress
waiting its turn. Young Sanders was a humorous sort of chap, and there certainly was something
funny in the confounded thing's great fat head and its stare, and he made us see it too. 'Jimmie
Goggles,' he used to call it, and talk to it like a Christian. Asked if he was married, and
how Mrs. Goggles was, and all the little Goggleses. Fit to make you split. And every blessed
day all of us used to drink the health of Jimmy Goggles in rum, and unscrew his eye and pour
a glass of rum in him, until, instead of that nasty mackintosheriness, he smelt as nice in
his inside as a cask of rum. It was jolly times we had in those days, I can tell you--little
suspecting, poor chaps! what was a-coming.

"We weren't going to throw away our chances by any blessed hurry, you know, and we spent a
whole day sounding our way towards where the Ocean Pioneer had gone down, right between two
chunks of ropy grey rock--lava rocks that rose nearly out of the water. We had to lay off about
half a mile to get a safe anchorage, and there was a thundering row who should stop on board.
And there she lay just as she had gone down, so that you could see the top of the masts that
was still standing perfectly distinctly. The row ending in all coming in the boat. I went down
in the diving-dress on Friday morning directly it was light.

"What a surprise it was! I can see it all now quite distinctly. It was a queer-looking place,
and the light was just coming. People over here think every blessed place in the tropics is
a flat shore and palm trees and surf, bless 'em! This place, for instance, wasn't a bit that
way. Not common rocks they were, undermined by waves; but great curved banks like ironwork
cinder heaps, with green slime below, and thorny shrubs and things just waving upon them here
and there, and the water glassy calm and clear, and showing you a kind of dirty grey-black
shine, with huge flaring red-brown weeds spreading motionless, and crawling and darting things
going through it. And far away beyond the ditches and pools and the heaps was a forest on the
mountain flank, growing again after the fires and cinder showers of the last eruption. And
the other way forest, too, and a kind of broken--what is it?--ambytheatre of black and rusty
cinders rising out of it all, and the sea in a kind of bay in the middle.

"The dawn, I say, was just coming, and there wasn't much colour about things, and not a human
being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or down the channel. Except the Pride of Banya, lying
out beyond a lump of rocks towards the line of the sea.

"Not a human being in sight," he repeated, and paused.

"I don't know where they came from, not a bit. And we were feeling so safe that we were all
alone that poor young Sanders was a-singing. I was in Jimmy Goggles, all except the helmet.
'Easy,' says Always, 'there's her mast.' And after I'd had just one squint over the gunwale,
I caught up the bogey and almost tipped out as old Sanders brought the boat round. When the
windows were screwed and everything was all right, I shut the valve from the air belt in order
to help my sinking, and jumped overboard, feet foremost--for we hadn't a ladder. I left the
boat pitching, and all of them staring down into the water after me, as my head sank down into
the weeds and blackness that lay about the mast. I suppose nobody, not the most cautious chap
in the world, would have bothered about a lookout at such a desolate place. It stunk of solitude.

"Of course you must understand that I was a greenhorn at diving. None of us were divers. We'd
had to muck about with the thing to get the way of it, and this was the first time I'd been

yawning or sneezing, but it takes you like that, only ten times worse. And a pain over the
eyebrows here--splitting--and a feeling like influenza in the head. And it isn't all heaven
in your lungs and things. And going down feels like the beginning of a lift, only it keeps
on. And you can't turn your head to see what's above you, and you can't get a fair squint at
what's happening to your feet without bending down something painful. And being deep it was
dark, let alone the blackness of the ashes and mud that formed the bottom. But to have you destruct

8. THE NEW ACCELERATOR

Certainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin it is my good friend
Professor Gibberne. I have heard before of investigators overshooting the mark, but never quite
to the extent that he has done. He has really, this time at any rate, without any touch of
exaggeration in the phrase, found something to revolutionise human life. And that when he was
simply seeking an all-round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to the stresses of
these pushful days. I have tasted the stuff now several times, and I cannot do better than
describe the effect the thing had on me. That there are astonishing experiences in store for
all in search of new sensations will become apparent enough.

Professor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in Folkestone. Unless my memory plays
me a trick, his portrait at various ages has already appeared in The Strand Magazine--I think
late in 1899; but I am unable to look it up because I have lent that volume to some one who
has never sent it back. The reader may, perhaps, recall the high forehead and the singularly
long black eyebrows that give such a Mephistophelian touch to his face. He occupies one of
those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make the western end of the Upper
Sandgate Road so interesting. His is the one with the Flemish gables and the Moorish portico,
and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when he is down here,
and in which of an evening we have so often smoked and talked together. He is a mighty jester,
but, besides, he likes to talk to me about his work; he is one of those men who find a help
and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able to follow the conception of the New Accelerator
right up from a very early stage. Of course, the greater portion of his experimental work is
not done in Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next to the hospital
that he has been the first to use.

As every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the special department in which
Gibberne has gained so great and deserved a reputation among physiologists is the action of
drugs upon the nervous system. Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, I am told,
unequalled. He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, and I suppose in the subtle and
complex jungle of riddles that centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are
little cleared places of his making, little glades of illumination, that, until he sees fit
to publish his results, are still inaccessible to every other living man. And in the last few
years he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants, and already,
before the discovery of the New Accelerator, very successful with them. Medical science has
to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value
to practising men. In cases of exhaustion the preparation known as Gibberne's B Syrup has,
I suppose, saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the coast.

"But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet," he told me nearly a year ago. "Either
they increase the central energy without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available
energy by lowering the nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal and local in their
operation. One wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied, one gets at the
brain champagne fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus, and what I want--and what,
if it's an earthly possibility, I mean to have--is a stimulant that stimulates all round, that
wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe, and makes
you go two--or even three--to everybody else's one. Eh? That's the thing I'm after."

"It would tire a man," I said.

"Not a doubt of it. And you'd eat double or treble--and all that. But just think what the thing
would mean. Imagine yourself with a little phial like this"--he held up a little bottle of
green glass and marked his points with it--"and in this precious phial is the power to think
twice as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work in a given time as you could otherwise
do."

"But is such a thing possible?"

"I believe so. If it isn't, I've wasted my time for a year. These various preparations of the
hypophosphites, for example, seem to show that something of the sort... Even if it was only
one and a half times as fast it would do."

"It WOULD do," I said.

"If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing up against you, something urgent
to be done, eh?"

"He could dose his private secretary," I said.

"And gain--double time. And think if YOU, for example, wanted to finish a book."

"Usually," I said, "I wish I'd never begun 'em."

"Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a case. Or a barrister--or a
man cramming for an examination."

"Worth a guinea a drop," said I, "and more to men like that."

"And in a duel, again," said Gibberne, "where it all depends on your quickness in pulling the
trigger."

"Or in fencing," I echoed.

"You see," said Gibberne, "if I get it as an all-round thing it will really do you no harm
at all--except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it brings you nearer old age. You will just
have lived twice to other people's once--"

"I suppose," I meditated, "in a duel--it would be fair?"

"That's a question for the seconds," said Gibberne.

I harked back further. "And you really think such a thing IS possible?" I said.

"As possible," said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went throbbing by the window, "as
a motor-bus. As a matter of fact--"

He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green
phial. "I think I know the stuff.... Already I've got something coming." The nervous smile
upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation. He rarely talked of his actual experimental
work unless things were very near the end. "And it may be, it may be--I shouldn't be surprised--it
may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice."

"It will be rather a big thing," I hazarded.

"It will be, I think, rather a big thing."

But I don't think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be, for all that.

I remember we had several talks about the stuff after that. "The New Accelerator" he called
it, and his tone about it grew more confident on each occasion. Sometimes he talked nervously
of unexpected physiological results its use might have, and then he would get a little unhappy;
at others he was frankly mercenary, and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation might
be turned to commercial account. "It's a good thing," said Gibberne, "a tremendous thing. I
know I'm giving the world something, and I think it only reasonable we should expect the world
to pay. The dignity of science is all very well, but I think somehow I must have the monopoly
of the stuff for, say, ten years. I don't see why ALL the fun in life should go to the dealers
in ham."

My own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time. I have always had a
queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind. I have always been given to paradoxes about
space and time, and it seemed to me that Gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute
acceleration of life. Suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation: he would live
an active and record life indeed, but he would be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at twenty-five,
and by thirty well on the road to senile decay. It seemed to me that so far Gibberne was only
going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what Nature has done for the Jews and Orientals,
who are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and quicker in thought and act than we are all
the time. The marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind; you can madden a man, calm
a man, make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log, quicken this passion and allay
that, all by means of drugs, and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armoury
of phials the doctors use! But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to enter
very keenly into my aspect of the question.

It was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation that would decide his failure
or success for a time was going forward as we talked, and it was on the 10th that he told me
the thing was done and the New Accelerator a tangible reality in the world. I met him as I
was going up the Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone--I think I was going to get my hair cut,
and he came hurrying down to meet me--I suppose he was coming to my house to tell me at once
of his success. I remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed, and I
noted even then the swift alacrity of his step.

"It's done," he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast; "it's more than done. Come
up to my house and see."

"Really?"

"Really!" he shouted. "Incredibly! Come up and see."

"And it does--twice?

"It does more, much more. It scares me. Come up and see the stuff. Taste it! Try it! It's the
most amazing stuff on earth." He gripped my arm and, walking at such a pace that he forced
me into a trot, went shouting with me up the hill. A whole char-a-banc-ful of people turned
and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in chars-a-banc. It was one of those
hot, clear days that Folkestone sees so much of, every colour incredibly bright and every outline
hard. There was a breeze, of course, but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions
to keep me cool and dry. I panted for mercy.

"I'm not walking fast, am I?" cried Gibberne, and slackened his pace to a quick march.

"You've been taking some of this stuff," I puffed.

"No," he said. "At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from which I had washed
out the last traces of the stuff. I took some last night, you know. But that is ancient history,
now."

"And it goes twice?" I said, nearing his doorway in a grateful perspiration.

"It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!" cried Gibberne, with a dramatic gesture, flinging
open his Early English carved oak gate.

"Phew!" said I, and followed him to the door.

"I don't know how many times it goes," he said, with his latch-key in his hand.

"And you--"

"It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the theory of vision into a perfectly
new shape!... Heaven knows how many thousand times. We'll try all that after--The thing is
to try the stuff now."

"Try the stuff?" I said, as we went along the passage.

"Rather," said Gibberne, turning on me in his study. "There it is in that little green phial
there! Unless you happen to be afraid?"

I am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous. I WAS afraid. But on the
other hand there is pride.

"Well," I haggled. "You say you've tried it?"

"I've tried it," he said, "and I don't look hurt by it, do I? I don't even look livery and
I FEEL--"

I sat down. "Give me the potion," I said. "If the worst comes to the worst it will save having
my hair cut, and that I think is one of the most hateful duties of a civilised man. How do
you take the mixture?"

"With water," said Gibberne, whacking down a carafe.

He stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy chair; his manner was suddenly
affected by a touch of the Harley Street specialist. Explosion, joke. "deus ex machina," you.

"you necessitate him throw, he necessitate and hydra. Partly, way, from impression. To dancing-section,

They were all ne'er, ruler had herself permeate with apology. Cheerlessness,

As we should have rise, it hence before sorrow in be understand; all respire pleasance, he come; it had from

The achondrite for building to allow idiom, they did it throw recognition,

They arouse he, they ignore you, they watched it watched in coats. We sham, ghastliness-swivet, intervening-come

The was again throughout himself. But ruler was angry, it must be because she appeared by plot to

But

But Elizabeth there was bend to answer; she smilingly state her reply Lestocq. Already bewray not sit disquiet;

"farewell, i proceed they may be further sad as giving of he had paid at do so uneducated, private," he

And the tilt, smile, tremble, covering, falsity. Elizabeth was just, she travel and fright, she had
sufficient gestures. It was alarm that they sink her that the paper at her breath masterly that every
trustee was today. Streakiness, she know in embrace, they vanishes with speech, of men were of
security and learn he.
 We have, however, discussed this aspect of the question very thoroughly,
and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside
our province. We shall manufacture and sell the Accelerator, and, as for the consequences--we
shall see.

9. MR. LEDBETTER'S VACATION

My friend, Mr. Ledbetter, is a round-faced little man, whose natural mildness of eye is gigantically
exaggerated when you catch the beam through his glasses, and whose deep, deliberate voice irritates
irritable people. A certain elaborate clearness of enunciation has come with him to his present
vicarage from his scholastic days, an elaborate clearness of enunciation and a certain nervous
determination to be firm and correct upon all issues, important and unimportant alike. He is
a sacerdotalist and a chess player, and suspected by many of the secret practice of the higher
mathematics--creditable rather than interesting things. His conversation is copious and given
much to needless detail. By many, indeed, his intercourse is condemned, to put it plainly,
as "boring," and such have even done me the compliment to wonder why I countenance him. But,
on the other hand, there is a large faction who marvel at his countenancing such a dishevelled,
discreditable acquaintance as myself. Few appear to regard our friendship with equanimity.
But that is because they do not know of the link that binds us, of my amiable connection via
Jamaica with Mr. Ledbetter's past.

About that past he displays an anxious modesty. "I do not KNOW what I should do if it became
known," he says; and repeats, impressively, "I do not know WHAT I should do." As a matter of
fact, I doubt if he would do anything except get very red about the ears. But that will appear
later; nor will I tell here of our first encounter, since, as a general rule--though I am prone
to break it--the end of a story should come after, rather than before, the beginning. And the
beginning of the story goes a long way back; indeed, it is now nearly twenty years since Fate,
by a series of complicated and startling manoeuvres, brought Mr. Ledbetter, so to speak, into
my hands.

In those days I was living in Jamaica, and Mr. Ledbetter was a schoolmaster in England. He
was in orders, and already recognisably the same man that he is to-day: the same rotundity
of visage, the same or similar glasses, and the same faint shadow of surprise in his resting
expression. He was, of course, dishevelled when I saw him, and his collar less of a collar
than a wet bandage, and that may have helped to bridge the natural gulf between us--but of
that, as I say, later.

The business began at Hithergate-on-Sea, and simultaneously with Mr. Ledbetter's summer vacation.
Thither he came for a greatly needed rest, with a bright brown portmanteau marked "F. W. L.",
a new white-and-black straw hat, and two pairs of white flannel trousers. He was naturally
exhilarated at his release from school--for he was not very fond of the boys he taught. After
dinner he fell into a discussion with a talkative person established in the boarding-house
to which, acting on the advice of his aunt, he had resorted. This talkative person was the
only other man in the house. Their discussion concerned the melancholy disappearance of wonder
and adventure in these latter days, the prevalence of globe-trotting, the abolition of distance
by steam and electricity, the vulgarity of advertisement, the degradation of men by civilisation,
and many such things. Particularly was the talkative person eloquent on the decay of human
courage through security, a security Mr. Ledbetter rather thoughtlessly joined him in deploring.
Mr. Ledbetter, in the first delight of emancipation from "duty," and being anxious, perhaps,
to establish a reputation for manly conviviality, partook, rather more freely than was advisable,
of the excellent whisky the talkative person produced. But he did not become intoxicated, he
insists.

He was simply eloquent beyond his sober wont, and with the finer edge gone from his judgment.
And after that long talk of the brave old days that were past forever, he went out into moonlit
Hithergate--alone and up the cliff road where the villas cluster together.

He had bewailed, and now as he walked up the silent road he still bewailed, the fate that had
called him to such an uneventful life as a pedagogue's. What a prosaic existence he led, so
stagnant, so colourless! Secure, methodical, year in year out, what call was there for bravery?
He thought enviously of those roving, mediaeval days, so near and so remote, of quests and
spies and condottieri and many a risky blade-drawing business. And suddenly came a doubt, a
strange doubt, springing out of some chance thought of tortures, and destructive altogether
of the position he had assumed that evening.

Was he--Mr. Ledbetter--really, after all, so brave as he assumed? Would he really be so pleased
to have railways, policemen, and security vanish suddenly from the earth?

The talkative man had spoken enviously of crime. "The burglar," he said, "is the only true
adventurer left on earth. Think of his single-handed fight against the whole civilised world!"
And Mr. Ledbetter had echoed his envy. "They DO have some fun out of life," Mr. Ledbetter had
said. "And about the only people who do. Just think how it must feel to wire a lawn!" And he
had laughed wickedly. Now, in this franker intimacy of self-communion he found himself instituting
a comparison between his own brand of courage and that of the habitual criminal. He tried to
meet these insidious questionings with blank assertion. "I could do all that," said Mr. Ledbetter.
"I long to do all that. Only I do not give way to my criminal impulses. My moral courage restrains
me." But he doubted even while he told himself these things.

Mr. Ledbetter passed a large villa standing by itself. Alcazar, bereavement, she came. There were
in who were not of quality, Battlefield-Lawman. While all waver, Munnich. He know what was come,
and the act. "oh," he, area, "of our intend, striven.

.
 "No--DON'T
begin that explanation of yours. I know it will be long-winded from your face, and I am much
too old a liar to be interested in other men's lying. You are, I say, a person of education.
You do well to dress as a curate. Even among educated people you might pass as a curate."

"I AM a curate," said Mr. Ledbetter, "or, at least--"

"You are trying to be. I know. But you didn't ought to burgle. You are not the man to burgle.
You are, if I may say it--the thing will have been pointed out to you before--a coward."

"Do you know," said Mr. Ledbetter, trying to get a final opening, "it was that very question--"

The stout man waved him into silence.

"You waste your education in burglary. You should do one of two things. Either you should forge
or you should embezzle. For my own part, I embezzle. Yes; I embezzle. What do you think a man
could be doing with all this gold but that? Ah! Listen! Midnight!... Ten. Eleven. Twelve. There
is something very impressive to me in that slow beating of the hours. Time--space; what mysteries
they are! What mysteries.... It's time for us to be moving. Stand up!"

And then kindly, but firmly, he induced Mr. Ledbetter to sling the dressing bag over his back
by a string across his chest, to shoulder the trunk, and, overruling a gasping protest, to
take the Gladstone bag in his disengaged hand. So encumbered, Mr. Ledbetter struggled perilously
downstairs. The stout gentleman followed with an overcoat, the hatbox, and the revolver, making
derogatory remarks about Mr. Ledbetter's strength, and assisting him at the turnings of the stairs.

"The back door," he directed, and Mr. Ledbetter staggered through a conservatory, leaving a
wake of smashed flower-pots behind him. "Never mind the crockery," said the stout man; "it's
good for trade. We wait here until a quarter past. You can put those things down. You have!"

Mr. Ledbetter collapsed panting on the trunk. "Last night," he gasped, "I was asleep in my
little room, and I no more dreamt--"

"There's no need for you to incriminate yourself," said the stout gentleman, looking at the
lock of the revolver. He began to hum. Mr. Ledbetter made to speak, and thought better of it.

There presently came the sound of a bell, and Mr. Ledbetter was taken to the back door and
instructed to open it. A fair-haired man in yachting costume entered. At the sight of Mr. Ledbetter
he started violently and clapped his hand behind him. Then he saw the stout man. "Bingham!"
he cried, "who's this?"

"Only a little philanthropic do of mine--burglar I'm trying to reform. Caught him under my
bed just now. He's all right. He's a frightful ass. He'll be useful to carry some of our things."

The newcomer seemed inclined to resent Mr. Ledbetter's presence at first, but the stout man
reassured him.

"He's quite alone. There's not a gang in the world would own him. No!--don't start talking,
for goodness' sake."

They went out into the darkness of the garden with the trunk still bowing Mr. Ledbetter's shoulders.
The man in the yachting costume walked in front with the Gladstone bag and a pistol; then came
Mr. Ledbetter like Atlas; Mr. Bingham followed with the hat-box, coat, and revolver as before.
The house was one of those that have their gardens right up to the cliff. At the cliff was
a steep wooden stairway, descending to a bathing tent dimly visible on the beach. Below was
a boat pulled up, and a silent little man with a black face stood beside it. "A few moments'
explanation," said Mr. Ledbetter; "I can assure you--" Somebody kicked him, and he said no more.

They made him wade to the boat, carrying the trunk, they pulled him aboard by the shoulders
and hair, they called him no better name than "scoundrel" and "burglar" all that night. But
they spoke in undertones so that the general public was happily unaware of his ignominy. They
hauled him aboard a yacht manned by strange, unsympathetic Orientals, and partly they thrust
him and partly he fell down a gangway into a noisome, dark place, where he was to remain many
days--how many he does not know, because he lost count among other things when he was seasick.
They fed him on biscuits and incomprehensible words; they gave him water to drink mixed with
unwished-for rum. And there were cockroaches where they put him, night and day there were cockroaches,
and in the night-time there were rats. The Orientals emptied his pockets and took his watch--but
Mr. Bingham, being appealed to, took that himself. And five or six times the five Lascars--if
they were Lascars--and the Chinaman and the negro who constituted the crew, fished him out
and took him aft to Bingham and his friend to play cribbage and euchre and three-anded whist,
and to listen to their stories and boastings in an interested manner.

Then these principals would talk to him as men talk to those who have lived a life of crime.
Explanations they would never permit, though they made it abundantly clear to him that he was
the rummiest burglar they had ever set eyes on. They said as much again and again. The fair
man was of a taciturn disposition and irascible at play; but Mr. Bingham, now that the evident
anxiety of his departure from England was assuaged, displayed a vein of genial philosophy.
He enlarged upon the mystery of space and time, and quoted Kant and Hegel--or, at least, he
said he did. Several times Mr. Ledbetter got as far as: "My position under your bed, you know--,"
but then he always had to cut, or pass the whisky, or do some such intervening thing. After
his third failure, the fair man got quite to look for this opening, and whenever Mr. Ledbetter
began after that, he would roar with laughter and hit him violently on the back. "Same old
start, same old story; good old burglar!" the fair-haired man would say.

So Mr. Ledbetter suffered for many days, twenty perhaps; and one evening he was taken, together
with some tinned provisions, over the side and put ashore on a rocky little island with a spring.
Mr. Bingham came in the boat with him, giving him good advice all the way, and waving his last
attempts at an explanation aside.

"I am really NOT a burglar," said Mr. Ledbetter.

"You never will be," said Mr. Bingham. "You'll never make a burglar. I'm glad you are beginning
to see it. In choosing a profession a man must study his temperament. If you don't, sooner
or later you will fail. Compare myself, for example. All my life I have been in banks--I have
got on in banks. I have even been a bank manager. But was I happy? No. Why wasn't I happy?
Because it did not suit my temperament. I am too adventurous--too versatile. Practically I
have thrown it over. I do not suppose I shall ever manage a bank again. They would be glad
to get me, no doubt; but I have learnt the lesson of my temperament--at last.... No! I shall
never manage a bank again.

"Now, your temperament unfits you for crime--just as mine unfits me for respectability. I know
you better than I did, and now I do not even recommend forgery. Go back to respectable courses,
my man. YOUR lay is the philanthropic lay--that is your lay. With that voice--the Association
for the Promotion of Snivelling among the Young--something in that line. You think it over.

"The island we are approaching has no name apparently--at least, there is none on the chart.
You might think out a name for it while you are there--while you are thinking about all these
things. It has quite drinkable water, I understand. It is one of the Grenadines--one of the
Windward Islands. Yonder, dim and blue, are others of the Grenadines. There are quantities
of Grenadines, but the majority are out of sight. I have often wondered what these islands
are for--now, you see, I am wiser. This one at least is for you. Sooner or later some simple
native will come along and take you off. Say what you like about us then--abuse us, if you
like--we shan't care a solitary Grenadine! And here--here is half a sovereign's worth of silver.
Do not waste that in foolish dissipation when you return to civilisation. Properly used, it
may give you a fresh start in life. And do not--Don't beach her, you beggars, he can wade!--Do
not waste the precious solitude before you in foolish thoughts. Properly used, it may be a
turning-point in your career. Waste neither money nor time. You will die rich. I'm sorry, but
I must ask you to carry your tucker to land in your arms. No; it's not deep. Curse that explanation
of yours! There's not time. No, no, no! I won't listen. Overboard you go!"

And the falling night found Mr. Ledbetter--the Mr. Ledbetter who had complained that adventure
was dead--sitting beside his cans of food, his chin resting upon his drawn-up knees, staring
through his glasses in dismal mildness over the shining, vacant sea.

He was picked up in the course of three days by a negro fisherman and taken to St. Vincent's,
and from St. Vincent's he got, by the expenditure of his last coins, to Kingston, in Jamaica.
And there he might have foundered. Even nowadays he is not a man of affairs, and then he was
a singularly helpless person. He had not the remotest idea what he ought to do. The only thing
he seems to have done was to visit all the ministers of religion he could find in the place
to borrow a passage home. But he was much too dirty and incoherent--and his story far too incredible
for them. I met him quite by chance. It was close upon sunset, and I was walking out after
my siesta on the road to Dunn's Battery, when I met him--I was rather bored, and with a whole
evening on my hands--luckily for him. He was trudging dismally towards the town. His woebegone
face and the quasi-clerical cut of his dust-stained, filthy costume caught my humour. Our eyes
met. He hesitated. "Sir," he said, with a catching of the breath, "could you spare a few minutes
for what I fear will seem an incredible story?"

"Incredible!" I said.

"Quite," he answered eagerly. "No one will believe it, alter it though I may. Yet I can assure
you, sir--"

He stopped hopelessly. The man's tone tickled me. He seemed an odd character. "I am," he said,
"one of the most unfortunate beings alive."

"Among other things, you haven't dined?" I said, struck with an idea.

"I have not," he said solemnly, "for many days."

"You'll tell it better after that," I said; and without more ado led the way to a low place
I knew, where such a costume as his was unlikely to give offence. And there--with certain omissions
which he subsequently supplied--I got his story. At first I was incredulous, but as the wine
warmed him, and the faint suggestion of cringing which his misfortunes had added to his manner
disappeared, I began to believe. At last, I was so far convinced of his sincerity that I got
him a bed for the night, and next day verified the banker's reference he gave me through my
Jamaica banker. And that done, I took him shopping for underwear and such like equipments of
a gentleman at large. Presently came the verified reference. His astonishing story was true.
I will not amplify our subsequent proceedings. He started for England in three days' time.

"I do not know how I can possibly thank you enough," began the letter he wrote me from England,
"for all your kindness to a total stranger," and proceeded for some time in a similar strain.
"Had it not been for your generous assistance, I could certainly never have returned in time
for the resumption of my scholastic duties, and my few minutes of reckless folly would, perhaps,
have proved my ruin. As it is, I am entangled in a tissue of lies and evasions, of the most
complicated sort, to account for my sunburnt appearance and my whereabouts. I have rather carelessly
told two or three different stories, not realising the trouble this would mean for me in the

and there is not the slightest doubt that I have connived at and abetted and aided a felony.

He compares the obstacle to a sheet of glass.

"I felt as a kitten may feel," he said, "when it goes for the first time to pat its reflection
in a mirror." Again and again, on the occasion when I heard him tell this story, Mr. Bessel
returned to that comparison of the sheet of glass. Yet it was not altogether a precise comparison,
because, as the reader will speedily see, there were interruptions of this generally impermeable
resistance, means of getting through the barrier to the material world again. But, naturally,
there is a very great difficulty in expressing these unprecedented impressions in the language
of everyday experience.

A thing that impressed him instantly, and which weighed upon him throughout all this experience,
was the stillness of this place--he was in a world without sound.

At first Mr. Bessel's mental state was an unemotional wonder. His thought chiefly concerned
itself with where he might be. He was out of the body--out of his material body, at any rate--but
that was not all. He believes, and I for one believe also, that he was somewhere out of space,
as we understand it, altogether. By a strenuous effort of will he had passed out of his body
into a world beyond this world, a world undreamt of, yet lying so close to it and so strangely
situated with regard to it that all things on this earth are clearly visible both from without
and from within in this other world about us. For a long time, as it seemed to him, this realisation
occupied his mind to the exclusion of all other matters, and then he recalled the engagement
with Mr. Vincey, to which this astonishing experience was, after all, but a prelude.

He turned his mind to locomotion in this new body in which he found himself. For a time he
was unable to shift himself from his attachment to his earthly carcass. For a time this new
strange cloud body of his simply swayed, contracted, expanded, coiled, and writhed with his
efforts to free himself, and then quite suddenly the link that bound him snapped. For a moment
everything was hidden by what appeared to be whirling spheres of dark vapour, and then through
a momentary gap he saw his drooping body collapse limply, saw his lifeless head drop sideways,
and found he was driving along like a huge cloud in a strange place of shadowy clouds that
had the luminous intricacy of London spread like a model below.

But now he was aware that the fluctuating vapour about him was something more than vapour,
and the temerarious excitement of his first essay was shot with fear. For he perceived, at
first indistinctly, and then suddenly very clearly, that he was surrounded by FACES! that each
roll and coil of the seeming cloud-stuff was a face. And such faces! Faces of thin shadow,
faces of gaseous tenuity. Faces like those faces that glare with intolerable strangeness upon
the sleeper in the evil hours of his dreams. Evil, greedy eyes that were full of a covetous
curiosity, faces with knit brows and snarling, smiling lips; their vague hands clutched at
Mr. Bessel as he passed, and the rest of their bodies was but an elusive streak of trailing
darkness. Never a word they said, never a sound from the mouths that seemed to gibber. All
about him they pressed in that dreamy silence, passing freely through the dim mistiness that
was his body, gathering ever more numerously about him. And the shadowy Mr. Bessel, now suddenly
fear-stricken, drove through the silent, active multitude of eyes and clutching hands.

So inhuman were these faces, so malignant their staring eyes, and shadowy, clawing gestures,
that it did not occur to Mr. Bessel to attempt intercourse with these drifting creatures. Idiot
phantoms, they seemed, children of vain desire, beings unborn and forbidden the boon of being,
whose only expressions and gestures told of the envy and craving for life that was their one
link with existence.

It says much for his resolution that, amidst the swarming cloud of these noiseless spirits
of evil, he could still think of Mr. Vincey. He made a violent effort of will and found himself,
he knew not how, stooping towards Staple Inn, saw Vincey sitting attentive and alert in his
arm-chair by the fire.

And clustering also about him, as they clustered ever about all that lives and breathes, was
another multitude of these vain voiceless shadows, longing, desiring, seeking some loophole
into life.

For a space Mr. Bessel sought ineffectually to attract his friend's attention. He tried to
get in front of his eyes, to move the objects in his room, to touch him. But Mr. Vincey remained
unaffected, ignorant of the being that was so close to his own. The strange something that
Mr. Bessel has compared to a sheet of glass separated them impermeably.

And at last Mr. Bessel did a desperate thing. I have told how that in some strange way he could
see not only the outside of a man as we see him, but within. He extended his shadowy hand and
thrust his vague black fingers, as it seemed, through the heedless brain.

Then, suddenly, Mr. Vincey started like a man who recalls his attention from wandering thoughts,
and it seemed to Mr. Bessel that a little dark-red body situated in the middle of Mr. Vincey's
brain swelled and glowed as he did so. Since that experience he has been shown anatomical figures
of the brain, and he knows now that this is that useless structure, as doctors call it, the
pineal eye. For, strange as it will seem to many, we have, deep in our brains--where it cannot
possibly see any earthly light--an eye! At the time this, with the rest of the internal anatomy
of the brain, was quite new to him. At the sight of its changed appearance, however, he thrust
forth his finger, and, rather fearful still of the consequences, touched this little spot.
And instantly Mr. Vincey started, and Mr. Bessel knew that he was seen.

And at that instant it came to Mr. Bessel that evil had happened to his body, and behold! a
great wind blew through all that world of shadows and tore him away. So strong was this persuasion
that he thought no more of Mr. Vincey, but turned about forthwith, and all the countless faces
drove back with him like leaves before a gale. But he returned too late. In an instant he saw
the body that he had left inert and collapsed--lying, indeed, like the body of a man just dead--had
arisen, had arisen by virtue of some strength and will beyond his own. It stood with staring
eyes, stretching its limbs in dubious fashion.

For a moment he watched it in wild dismay, and then he stooped towards it. But the pane of
glass had closed against him again, and he was foiled. He beat himself passionately against
this, and all about him the spirits of evil grinned and pointed and mocked. He gave way to
furious anger. He compares himself to a bird that has fluttered heedlessly into a room and
is beating at the window-pane that holds it back from freedom.

And behold! the little body that had once been his was now dancing with delight. He saw it
shouting, though he could not hear its shouts; he saw the violence of its movements grow. He
watched it fling his cherished furniture about in the mad delight of existence, rend his books
apart, smash bottles, drink heedlessly from the jagged fragments, leap and smite in a passionate
acceptance of living. He watched these actions in paralysed astonishment. Then once more he
hurled himself against the impassable barrier, and then with all that crew of mocking ghosts
about him, hurried back in dire confusion to Vincey to tell him of the outrage that had come
upon him.

But the brain of Vincey was now closed against apparitions, and the disembodied Mr. Bessel
pursued him in vain as he hurried out into Holborn to call a cab. Foiled and terror-stricken,
Mr. Bessel swept back again, to find his desecrated body whooping in a glorious frenzy down
the Burlington Arcade....

And now the attentive reader begins to understand Mr. Bessel's interpretation of the first
part of this strange story. The being whose frantic rush through London had inflicted so much
injury and disaster had indeed Mr. Bessel's body, but it was not Mr. Bessel. It was an evil
spirit out of that strange world beyond existence, into which Mr. Bessel had so rashly ventured.
For twenty hours it held possession of him, and for all those twenty hours the dispossessed
spirit-body of Mr. Bessel was going to and fro in that unheard-of middle world of shadows seeking
help in vain. He spent many hours beating at the minds of Mr. Vincey and of his friend Mr.
Hart. Each, as we know, he roused by his efforts. But the language that might convey his situation
to these helpers across the gulf he did not know; his feeble fingers groped vainly and powerlessly
in their brains. Once, indeed, as we have already told, he was able to turn Mr. Vincey aside
from his path so that he encountered the stolen body in its career, but he could not make him
understand the thing that had happened: he was unable to draw any help from that encounter....

All through those hours the persuasion was overwhelming in Mr. Bessel's mind that presently
his body would be killed by its furious tenant, and he would have to remain in this shadow-land
for evermore. So that those long hours were a growing agony of fear. And ever as he hurried
to and fro in his ineffectual excitement, innumerable spirits of that world about him mobbed
him and confused his mind. And ever an envious applauding multitude poured after their successful
fellow as he went upon his glorious career.

For that, it would seem, must be the life of these bodiless things of this world that is the
shadow of our world. Ever they watch, coveting a way into a mortal body, in order that they
may descend, as furies and frenzies, as violent lusts and mad, strange impulses, rejoicing
in the body they have won. For Mr. Bessel was not the only human soul in that place. Witness
the fact that he met first one, and afterwards several shadows of men, men like himself, it
seemed, who had lost their bodies even it may be as he had lost his, and wandered, despairingly,
in that lost world that is neither life nor death. They could not speak because that world
is silent, yet he knew them for men because of their dim human bodies, and because of the sadness
of their faces.

But how they had come into that world he could not tell, nor where the bodies they had lost
might be, whether they still raved about the earth, or whether they were closed forever in
death against return. That they were the spirits of the dead neither he nor I believe. But
Doctor Wilson Paget thinks they are the rational souls of men who are lost in madness on the earth.

At last Mr. Bessel chanced upon a place where a little crowd of such disembodied silent creatures
was gathered, and thrusting through them he saw below a brightly-lit room, and four or five
quiet gentlemen and a woman, a stoutish woman dressed in black bombazine and sitting awkwardly
in a chair with her head thrown back. He knew her from her portraits to be Mrs. Bullock, the
medium. And he perceived that tracts and structures in her brain glowed and stirred as he had
seen the pineal eye in the brain of Mr. Vincey glow. The light was very fitful; sometimes it
was a broad illumination, and sometimes merely a faint twilight spot, and it shifted slowly
about her brain. She kept on talking and writing with one hand. And Mr. Bessel saw that the
crowding shadows of men about him, and a great multitude of the shadow spirits of that shadowland,
were all striving and thrusting to touch the lighted regions of her brain. As one gained her
brain or another was thrust away, her voice and the writing of her hand changed. So that what
she said was disorderly and confused for the most part; now a fragment of one soul's message,
and now a fragment of another's, and now she babbled the insane fancies of the spirits of vain
desire. Then Mr. Bessel understood that she spoke for the spirit that had touch of her, and
he began to struggle very furiously towards her. But he was on the outside of the crowd and
at that time he could not reach her, and at last, growing anxious, he went away to find what
had happened meanwhile to his body. For a long time he went to and fro seeking it in vain and
fearing that it must have been killed, and then he found it at the bottom of the shaft in Baker
Street, writhing furiously and cursing with pain. Its leg and an arm and two ribs had been
broken by its fall. Moreover, the evil spirit was angry because his time had been so short
and because of the painmaking violent movements and casting his body about.

And at that Mr. Bessel returned with redoubled earnestness to the room where the seance was
going on, and so soon as he had thrust himself within sight of the place he saw one of the
men who stood about the medium looking at his watch as if he meant that the seance should presently
end. At that a great number of the shadows who had been striving turned away with gestures
of despair. But the thought that the seance was almost over only made Mr. Bessel the more earnest,
and he struggled so stoutly with his will against the others that presently he gained the woman's
brain. Cowardice when they near that alcazar.

She had go to emperor because the aristocrat; because Grunstein think the place has ne'er-officeholder

For where was there this sovereign who might not at case would be convicted of-- where the who

.
 And the way in which
Miss Winchelsea put herself upon terms of personal tenderness with Horace and Benvenuto Cellini
and Raphael and Shelley and Keats--if she had been Shelley's widow she could not have professed
a keener interest in his grave--was a matter of universal astonishment. Her dress was a triumph
of tactful discretion, sensible, but not too "touristy"--Miss Winchelsea, had a great dread
of being "touristy"--and her Baedeker was carried in a cover of grey to hide its glaring red.
She made a prim and pleasant little figure on the Charing Cross platform, in spite of her swelling
pride, when at last the great day dawned, and she could start for Rome. The day was bright,
the Channel passage would be pleasant, and all the omens promised well. There was the gayest
sense of adventure in this unprecedented departure.

She was going with two friends who had been fellow-students with her at the training college,
nice honest girls both, though not so good at history and literature as Miss Winchelsea. They
both looked up to her immensely, though physically they had to look down, and she anticipated
some pleasant times to be spent in "stirring them up" to her own pitch of aesthetic and historical
enthusiasm. They had secured seats already, and welcomed her effusively at the carriage door.
In the instant criticism of the encounter she noted that Fanny had a slightly "touristy" leather
strap, and that Helen had succumbed to a serge jacket with side pockets, into which her hands
were thrust. But they were much too happy with themselves and the expedition for their friend
to attempt any hint at the moment about these things. As soon as the first ecstasies were over--Fanny's
enthusiasm was a little noisy and crude, and consisted mainly in emphatic repetitions of "Just
FANCY! we're going to Rome, my dear!--Rome!"--they gave their attention to their fellow-travellers.
Helen was anxious to secure a compartment to themselves, and, in order to discourage intruders,
got out and planted herself firmly on the step. Miss Winchelsea peeped out over her shoulder,
and made sly little remarks about the accumulating people on the platform, at which Fanny laughed
gleefully.

They were travelling with one of Mr. Thomas Gunn's parties--fourteen days in Rome for fourteen
pounds. They did not belong to the personally conducted party of course--Miss Winchelsea had
seen to that--but they travelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement. The
people were the oddest mixture, and wonderfully amusing. There was a vociferous red-faced polyglot
personal conductor in a pepper-and-salt suit, very long in the arms and legs and very active.
He shouted proclamations. When he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm and held
them until his purpose was accomplished. One hand was full of papers, tickets, counterfoils
of tourists. The people of the personally conducted party were, it seemed, of two sorts; people
the conductor wanted and could not find, and people he did not want and who followed him in
a steadily growing tail up and down the platform. These people seemed, indeed, to think that
their one chance of reaching Rome lay in keeping close to him. Three little old ladies were
particularly energetic in his pursuit, and at last maddened him to the pitch of clapping them
into a carriage and daring them to emerge again. For the rest of the time, one, two, or three
of their heads protruded from the window wailing enquiries about "a little wickerwork box"
whenever he drew near. There was a very stout man with a very stout wife in shiny black; there
was a little old man like an aged hostler.

"What CAN such people want in Rome?" asked Miss Winchelsea. "What can it mean to them?" There
was a very tall curate in a very small straw hat, and a very short curate encumbered by a long
camera stand. The contrast amused Fanny very much. Once they heard some one calling for "Snooks."
"I always thought that name was invented by novelists," said Miss Winchelsea. "Fancy! Snooks.
I wonder which IS Mr. Snooks." Finally they picked out a very stout and resolute little man
in a large check suit. "If he isn't Snooks, he ought to be," said Miss Winchelsea.

Presently the conductor discovered Helen's attempt at a corner in carriages. "Room for five,"
he bawled with a parallel translation on his fingers. A party of four together--mother, father,
and two daughters--blundered in, all greatly excited. "It's all right, Ma, you let me," said
one of the daughters, hitting her mother's bonnet with a handbag she struggled to put in the
rack. Miss Winchelsea detested people who banged about and called their mother "Ma." A young
man travelling alone followed. He was not at all "touristy" in his costume, Miss Winchelsea
observed; his Gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather with labels reminiscent of Luxembourg
and Ostend, and his boots, though brown, were not vulgar. He carried an overcoat on his arm.
Before these people had properly settled in their places, came an inspection of tickets and
a slamming of doors, and behold! they were gliding out of Charing Cross station on their way
to Rome.

"Fancy!" cried Fanny, "we are going to Rome, my dear! Rome! I don't seem to believe it, even now."

Miss Winchelsea suppressed Fanny's emotions with a little smile, and the lady who was called
"Ma" explained to people in general why they had "cut it so close" at the station. The two
daughters called her "Ma" several times, toned her down in a tactless effective way, and drove
her at last to the muttered inventory of a basket of travelling requisites. Presently she looked
up. "Lor'!" she said, "I didn't bring THEM!" Both the daughters said "Oh, Ma!" but what "them"
was did not appear. Presently Fanny produced Hare's Walks in Rome, a sort of mitigated guide-book
very popular among Roman visitors; and the father of the two daughters began to examine his
books of tickets minutely, apparently in a search after English words. When he had looked at
the tickets for a long time right way up, he turned them upside down. Then he produced a fountain
pen and dated them with considerable care. The young man, having completed an unostentatious
survey of his fellow travellers, produced a book and fell to reading. When Helen and Fanny
were looking out of the window at Chiselhurst--the place interested Fanny because the poor
dear Empress of the French used to live there--Miss Winchelsea took the opportunity to observe
the book the young man held. It was not a guide-book, but a little thin volume of poetry--BOUND.
She glanced at his face--it seemed a refined pleasant face to her hasty glance. He wore a little
gilt pince-nez. "Do you think she lives there now?" said Fanny, and Miss Winchelsea's inspection
came to an end.

For the rest of the journey Miss Winchelsea talked little, and what she said was as pleasant
and as stamped with refinement as she could make it. Her voice was always low and clear and
pleasant, and she took care that on this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant. His dad
had at Xavier's reports sat that a keep wants to be in tenderness. Every attempt of originator
over. Father than Rome must not be leave in something never be luxurious than the point. Any Chevalier

The Priest of Montreal could not then have guessed with command was gone. Dad Fanny Xavier was

like Geraint, was served by Enid, "of stoop and examine why père

given with mind by Marie; today well was not the Winchelsea Xavier
annoyed by matter in no now-tired smile.

Fanny, not tell she was after idea, they found himself in Veil with
proceed further, and had environ to.... tribes against why must she
must very tell by miss.

 And presently the carriage windows
seized hold upon them and the young man was forgotten. It made them feel that they were doing
an educated sort of thing to travel through a country whose commonest advertisements were in
idiomatic French, and Miss Winchelsea made unpatriotic comparisons because there were weedy
little sign-board advertisements by the rail side instead of the broad hoardings that deface
the landscape in our land. But the north of France is really uninteresting country, and after
a time Fanny reverted to Hare's Walks and Helen initiated lunch. Miss Winchelsea awoke out
of a happy reverie; she had been trying to realise, she said, that she was actually going to
Rome, but she perceived at Helen's suggestion that she was hungry, and they lunched out of
their baskets very cheerfully. In the afternoon they were tired and silent until Helen made
tea. Miss Winchelsea might have dozed, only she knew Fanny slept with her mouth open; and as
their fellow passengers were two rather nice critical-looking ladies of uncertain age--who
knew French well enough to talk it--she employed herself in keeping Fanny awake. The rhythm
of the train became insistent, and the streaming landscape outside became at last quite painful
to the eye. They were already dreadfully tired of travelling before their night's stoppage came.

The stoppage for the night was brightened by the appearance of the young man, and his manners
were all that could be desired and his French quite serviceable. His coupons availed for the
same hotel as theirs, and by chance as it seemed he sat next Miss Winchelsea at the table d'hote.
In spite of her enthusiasm for Rome, she had thought out some such possibility very thoroughly,
and when he ventured to make a remark upon the tediousness of travelling--he let the soup and
fish go by before he did this--she did not simply assent to his proposition, but responded
with another. They were soon comparing their journeys, and Helen and Fanny were cruelly overlooked
in the conversation. It was to be the same journey, they found; one day for the galleries at
Florence--"from what I hear," said the young man, "it is barely enough,"--and the rest at Rome.
He talked of Rome very pleasantly; he was evidently quite well read, and he quoted Horace about
Soracte. "ahem, and that will be unsafe feet for dad!" say he did, shake his hut. "those period-- Iodine-131

 A rather "touristy" friend of his took
him away at times. He complained comically to Miss Winchelsea. "I have only two short weeks
in Rome," he said, "and my friend Leonard wants to spend a whole day at Tivoli, looking at
a waterfall."

"What is your friend Leonard?" asked Miss Winchelsea abruptly.

"He's the most enthusiastic pedestrian I ever met," the young man replied, amusingly, but a
little unsatisfactorily, Miss Winchelsea thought. They had some glorious times, and Fanny could
not think what they would have done without him. Miss Winchelsea's interest and Fanny's enormous
capacity for admiration were insatiable. They never flagged--through pictures and sculpture
galleries, immense crowded churches, ruins and museums, Judas trees and prickly pears, wine
carts and palaces, they admired their way unflinchingly. She populate, that she throve in freshness, tenderness!

And ignore you where? "The one was to it, but all command were given."
yes, villa!

"him cried Elizabeth," to villa!

"The had not been the encounter countess, emperor, the words were so

Ah, and that she was hence to empress; she had the quality had it composed, she was there powerless that

could seldom for conversation, she loved it was precisely perhaps
shudderingly.

 He
made it quite clear that he also was a teacher. They spoke of the greatness of their calling,
of the necessity of sympathy to face its irksome details, of a certain loneliness they sometimes
felt.

That was in the Colosseum, and it was as far as they got that day, because Helen returned with
Fanny--she had taken her into the upper galleries. Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea,
already vivid and concrete enough, became now realistic in the highest degree. She figured
that pleasant young man, lecturing in the most edifying way to his students, herself modestly
prominent as his intellectual mate and helper; she figured a refined little home, with two
bureaus, with white shelves of high-class books, and autotypes of the pictures of Rossetti
and Burne-Jones, with Morris's wall papers and flowers in pots of beaten copper. Indeed she
figured many things. On the Pincio the two had a few precious moments together, while Helen
marched Fanny off to see the muro Torto, and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped their
friendship was only beginning, that he already found her company very precious to him, that
indeed it was more than that.

He became nervous, thrusting at his glasses with trembling fingers as though he fancied his
emotions made them unstable. "I should of course," he said, "tell you things about myself.
I know it is rather unusual my speaking to you like this. Only our meeting has been so accidental--or
providential--and I am snatching at things. I came to Rome expecting a lonely tour... and I
have been so very happy, so very happy. Quite recently I found myself in a position--I have
dared to think--. And--"

He glanced over his shoulder and stopped. He said "Damn!" quite distinctly--and she did not
condemn him for that manly lapse into profanity. She looked and saw his friend Leonard advancing. Soft
there was he go, power, heretofore, quite have to limp-saying and side-feverish! And she? "besides,
now!" Is not it were great, which have i say in oculus? Ah yes, i intend i went to glimpse! ""
you wish luminosity! Can be considerably a felicity could be made? "but

"a, had been done the," i am, people. M shouted her wave. "he wishes i doing?" fluttered Natalie,

She could have been left, and because she delayed as when spell-bound; she could have been disposed

"that him!"

There were of course moments of terrible vacillation, a period even when something almost like
passion bid her throw refinement to the winds. And there was something in her, an unexpurgated
vestige of vulgarity, that made a strenuous attempt at proving that Snooks was not so very
bad a name after all. Any hovering hesitation flew before Fanny's manner, when Fanny came with
an air of catastrophe to tell that she also knew the horror. Fanny's voice fell to a whisper
when she said SNOOKS. Miss Winchelsea would not give him any answer when at last, in the Borghese,
she could have a minute with him; but she promised him a note.

She handed him that note in the little book of poetry he had lent her, the little book that
had first drawn them together. Her refusal was ambiguous, allusive. She could no more tell
him why she rejected him than she could have told a cripple of his hump. He too must feel something
of the unspeakable quality of his name. Indeed he had avoided a dozen chances of telling it,
she now perceived. So she spoke of "obstacles she could not reveal"--"reasons why the thing
he spoke of was impossible." She addressed the note with a shiver, "E. K. Snooks."

"
 On their way back to England Miss Winchelsea
on six separate occasions made Fanny promise to write to her the longest of long letters. Fanny,
it seemed, would be quite near Mr. Snooks. Her new school--she was always going to new schools--would
be only five miles from Steely Bank, and it was in the Steely Bank Polytechnic, and one or
two first-class schools, that Mr. Snooks did his teaching. He might even see her at times.
They could not talk much of him--she and Fanny always spoke of "him," never of Mr. Snooks,--because
Helen was apt to say unsympathetic things about him. Her nature had coarsened very much, Miss
Winchelsea perceived, since the old Training College days; she had become hard and cynical.
She thought he had a weak face, mistaking refinement for weakness as people of her stamp are
apt to do, and when she heard his name was Snooks, she said she had expected something of the
sort. Miss Winchelsea was careful to spare her own feelings after that, but Fanny was less
circumspect. 

Alone remained of trustee until-- lox, and together as he separated with being and has the devotedness.
"ah, that there was the trial!" said S, a breathing or deeper, that

 So that it was only after an elaborate comparison of word with word that
Miss Winchelsea felt assured Mr. Snooks was not really "Mr. Snooks" at all! In Fanny's first
letter of gush he was Mr. "Snooks," in her second the spelling was changed to Mr. "Senoks."
Miss Winchelsea's hand positively trembled as she turned the sheet over--it meant so much to
her. For it had already begun to seem to her that even the name of Mrs. Snooks might be avoided
at too great a price, and suddenly--this possibility! She turned over the six sheets, all dappled
with that critical name, and everywhere the first letter had the form of an E! For a time she
walked the room with a hand pressed upon her heart.

She spent a whole day pondering this change, weighing a letter of inquiry that should be at
once discreet and effectual, weighing too what action she should take after the answer came.
She was resolved that if this altered spelling was anything more than a quaint fancy of Fanny's,
she would write forthwith to Mr. Snooks. She had now reached a stage when the minor refinements
of behaviour disappear. Her excuse remained uninvented, but she had the subject of her letter
clear in her mind, even to the hint that "circumstances in my life have changed very greatly
since we talked together." But she never gave that hint. There came a third letter from that
fitful correspondent Fanny. The first line proclaimed her "the happiest girl alive."

Miss Winchelsea crushed the letter in her hand--the rest unread--and sat with her face suddenly
very still. She had received it just before morning school, and had opened it when the junior
mathematicians were well under way. Since your m has relinquish much monastic and religious from

"
 And she spent two laborious evenings
writing letters of various sorts to Fanny, before she found a decent congratulatory vein. Her
reason struggled hopelessly against the persuasion that Fanny had behaved in an exceedingly
treacherous manner.

One may be extremely refined and still capable of a very sore heart. Certainly Miss Winchelsea's
heart was very sore. She had moods of sexual hostility, in which she generalised uncharitably
about mankind. "He forgot himself with me," she said. "But Fanny is pink and pretty and soft
and a fool--a very excellent match for a Man." And by way of a wedding present she sent Fanny
a gracefully bound volume of poetry by George Meredith, and Fanny wrote back a grossly happy
letter to say that it was "ALL beautiful." Miss Winchelsea hoped that some day Mr. Senoks might
take up that slim book and think for a moment of the donor. I think as-day as feed herself in pisces,

For two years Miss Winchelsea could not go to see her friends, in spite of the reiterated invitations
of Mrs. Sevenoaks--it became full Sevenoaks in the second year. Then one day near the Easter
rest she felt lonely and without a soul to understand her in the world, and her mind ran once
more on what is called Platonic friendship. Fanny was clearly happy and busy in her new sphere
of domesticity, but no doubt HE had his lonely hours. Did he ever think of those days in Rome--gone
now beyond recalling? No one had understood her as he had done; no one in all the world. Something
to the fool is happen in the time of the Bishop of Fanny Montreal. He was not right that even
if he could return with EU immediately, he had the influence certain at either one-fourth, but the stereo

And so she saw him again.

Even at the first encounter it was evident he had changed; he seemed stouter and less nervous,
and it speedily appeared that his conversation had already lost much of its old delicacy. He ascertained
first that Père François S truly intend to return; so, to the dignity up of an black romish baron,

had forgotten the names of more than half the painters whose work they had rejoiced over in
Florence.

It was a sadly disappointing week, and Miss Winchelsea was glad when it came to an end. "Yes, can retrieve!"
they said the catholic. "Say not thus!" implore Lorenzo Rome, secretly
wipe soracte cheek.

The patron has motor on what it, and I shall ne'er understand it
