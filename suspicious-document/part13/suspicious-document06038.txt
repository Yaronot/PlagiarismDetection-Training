CHAPTER XVIII.

Selene and Helios were baptized, and two days after dame Hannah with her adopted children and
Mary, escorted by the presbyter Hilarion and a deacon, embarked in the harbor of Mareotis on
board a Nile-boat which was to convey them to their new home, the town of Besa in Upper Egypt.
The deformed girl had hesitated as to her answer to the widow's question whether she would
accompany her.  Her old mother dwelt in Alexandria, and then--but it was this "then" which
helped her abruptly to cut short all reflection and to pronounce a decided "yes," for it referred
to Antinous.

For a few minutes it had seemed unendurable to think that she should never see him again, for
she could not help often thinking of the beautiful youth, and her whole heart ought to belong
solely to the One who had with His blood purchased peace for her on earth and bliss in the
world to come.

The day after being baptized, Selene had gone to Paulina's town-house, and there, with many
tears had taken leave of Arsinoe.  All the affection which bound the sisters together found
expression at this moment of parting.  Selene had heard from Paulina that Pollux was dead,
and she no longer grudged her rival sister that she grieved for him more passionately than
herself, though at first her peace of mind had more than once been disturbed by memories of
her old playfellow.

  The boy's firm faith, which was not to be shaken
by any reasoning or by any of the myths which she knew, touched her deeply and led to her asking
Hannah what was the real bearing of one and another of his statements.  It had always seemed
a comfort to her that the miseries of our earthly life would come to an end with death; but
Helios left her without a reply when he said in a sad voice:

"Do you feel no longing, then, to see our father and mother again?"

To see her mother again!  This thought gave her an interest in the next world, and dame Hannah
fanned the spark of hope in her soul into flame.

Selene had seen and suffered much misery, and was accustomed to call the gods cruel.  Helios
told her that God and the Saviour were good and kind, and loved human beings as their children.

"Is it not good and kind," asked he, "of our Heavenly Father to lead us to dame Hannah?"

"Yes, but we have all been torn apart," said Selene.  "Never mind," said the child confidently,
"we shall all meet in Heaven."

As she got well Selene asked after each of the children and Hannah described all the families
into which they had been received.  The widow did not look as if she spoke falsely, and the
little ones, when they came to see her, confirmed her report, and yet Selene could hardly believe
in the accuracy of the pictures drawn of their lives in the houses of the Christians.

The mother of a Christian family--says a great Christian teacher--should be the pride of her
children, the wife the pride of her husband, husband and children the pride of the wife, and
God the pride and glory of every member of the household.  Love and faith in fact the bond,
contentment and virtuous living the law of the family; and it was in just such a pure and beneficent
atmosphere, as Selene herself and Helios felt the blessing of in Hannah's house, that each
and all of her brothers and sisters were growing up.  Her upright sense gave an honest answer
when she asked herself what would have become of them all if her father had remained alive
and had been dispossessed of his office?  They must all have perished in misery and degradation.

And now?--Perhaps in truth the Divine Being had dealt in kindness with the children.

Love, love, and again love, was breathed from all she saw and heard, and yet--was it not love
that had caused her greatest sorrows.  Wherefore had it been her lot to endure so much through
the same sentiment which beautified life to others?  Had any one ever had more to suffer than
she? Aye indeed!  A vivacious, eager youth had duped her and had promised happiness to her
sister instead of to her; it had been hard to bear--and yet, the Saviour of whom Hellos had
told her, had been far more severely tried.  Mankind, for whom He--the Son of God--had come
down upon earth, to save from misery and guilt, had rewarded His loving kindness by hanging
Him on the cross.  In Him she could see a companion in suffering and she asked the widow to
tell her all about Him.  Selene had made many sacrifices to her family--she could never forget
her walk to the papyrus- factory--but He had let them mock Him and had shed His blood for His
own. And who was she?--and who was He?  The Son of God.  His image became dear to her; she
was never weary of hearing about His life and fate, His words and deeds; and without her observing
it the day came when her soul was free to receive the teaching of Christ with fervent longing.
With faith she acquired that consciousness of guilt which had previously been unknown to her.
She had been busy and industrious out of pride and fear, but never from love; she had selfishly
tried to fling from her the sacred gift of life without ever thinking what would become of
those whom it was her duty to care for.  She had cursed her lovely sister who needed her protection
and care, and even Pollux, her childhood's playfellow; and a thousand times had she imprecated
the ruler of human destinies.  All this she now keenly felt with all the earnestness natural
to her, but she was soothed by the tidings that there was One who had redeemed the world, and
taken on Himself the sins of every repentant sinner.

After Selene had once expressed to the widow her desire to be a Christian, Hannah brought the
bishop to see her.  He himself undertook to instruct the girl and he found in her a disciple
anxious and craving for knowledge.  Just like those dried-up and dull-colored plants which,
when they are plunged in water, open out and revive, so did her heart, untimely withered and
dry; and she longed to be perfectly recovered that she, like Hannah, might tend the sick and
exercise that love which Christ demands of His followers. They felt in Region and they could purchase hopes

But she sighed impatiently for the hour when she might read him all the verses she had addressed
to Antinous, and ask him how he liked them.  It gave her a childish pleasure to add to the
number of these little poems, to finish them elaborately, and display in them all her knowledge
and ability.  She gave the preference to artificial and massive metres; some of the verses
were in Latin, others in the Attic, and others again in the Aeolian dialects of Greek, for
she had now learnt to use this, and all to punish Pontius--to vex Pontius--and at the same
time to appear in his eyes as brilliant as she could.  She belauded Antinous, but she wrote
for Pontius, and for every flower she gave the lad she had sent a thought to the architect,
though with a curl on her lips of scornful defiance.

But a young girl cannot be always praising the beauty of a youth in new and varied forms with
complete impunity, and thus there were hours when Balbilla was inclined to believe that she
really loved Antinous.  Then she would call herself his Sappho, and he seemed destined to be
her Phaon.  During his long absences with the Emperor she would long to see him--nay, even
with tears; but, as soon as he was by her side again, and she could look at his inanimate beauty
and into his weary eyes, when she heard the torpid "Yes" or "No" with which he replied to her
questions, the spell was entirely broken and she honestly confessed to herself that she would
as soon see him before her hewn in marble as clothed in flesh and blood.

In such moments as these her memory of the architect was particularly fresh, and once, when
their ship was sailing through a mass of lotos leaves, above which one splendid full-blown
flower raised its head, her apt imagination, which rapidly seized on everything noteworthy
and gave it poetic form, entwined the incident in a set of verses, in which she designated
Antinous as the lotos-flower which fulfils its destiny simply by being beautiful, and comparing
Pontius to the ship which, well constructed and well guided, invited the traveller to new voyages
in distant lands.

The Nile voyage came to an end at Thebes of the hundred gates, and here nothing that could
attract the Roman travellers remained unvisited.  The tombs of the Pharaohs extending into
the very heart of the rocky hills, and the grand temples that stood to the west of the city
of the dead, shorn though they were of their ancient glory, filled the Emperor with admiration.
The Imperial travellers and their companions listened to the famous colossus of Memnon, of
which the upper portion had been overthrown by an earthquake, and three times in the dawn they
heard it sound.

Balbilla described the incident in several long poems which Sabina caused to be engraved on
the stone of the colossus.  The poetess imagined herself as hearing the voice of Memnon singing
to his mother Eos while her tears, the fresh morning dew, fell upon the image of her son, fallen
before the walls of Troy.  These verses she composed in the Aeolian dialect, named herself
as their writer and informed the readers--among whom she included Pontius--that she was descended
from a house no less noble than that of King Antiochus.

The gigantic structures on each bank of the Nile fully equalled Hadrian's expectations, though
they had suffered so much injury from earthquakes and sieges, and the impoverished priesthood
of Thebes were no longer in a position to provide for their preservation even, much less for
their restoration.  Balbilla accompanied Caesar on a visit to the sanctuary of Ammon, on the
eastern shore of the Nile.  In the great hall, the most vast and lofty pillared hall in the
world, her impressionable soul felt a peculiar exaltation, and as the Emperor observed how,
with a heightened color she now gazed upward, and then again, leaning against a towering column,
looked at the scene around her, he asked her what she felt, standing in this really worthy
abode of the gods.

"One thing--above all things one thing!"  cried the girl.  "That architecture is the sublimest
of the arts!  This temple is to me like some grand epode, and the poet who composed it conceived
it not in feeble words but formed it out of almost immovable masses.  Thousands of parts are
here combined to form a whole, and each is welded with the rest into beautiful harmony and
helps to give expression to the stupendous idea which existed in the brain of the builder of
this hall.  What other art is gifted with the power of creating a work so imperishable and
so far transcending all ordinary standards?"

"A poetess crowning the architect with laurels!"  exclaimed the Emperor. "But is not the poet's
realm the infinite, and can the architect ever get beyond the finite and the limited?"

"Then is the nature of the divinity a measurable unit?"  asked Balbilla. "No, it is not; and
yet this hall gives one the impression that the very divinity might find space in it to dwell in."

"Because it owes it existence to a master-mind, which while it conceived it stood on the boundary
line of eternity.  But do you think this temple will outlast the poems of Homer?"

"No; but the memory of it will no more fade away that of the wrath of Achilles or the wanderings
of the experienced Odysseus."

"It is a pity that our friend Pontius cannot hear you," said Hadrian. "He has completed the
plans for a work which is destined to outlive me and him and all of us.

"I mean my own tomb.  Besides that I intend him to erect gates, courts and halls in the Egyptian
style at Tibur, which may remind us of our travels in this wonderful country.  I expect him
to-morrow."

"To-morrow!"  exclaimed Balbilla, and her face fired with a scarlet flush to her very brow.

CHAPTER XX.

Shortly after starting from Thebes--on the second day of November-- Hadrian came to a great
decision.  Verus should be acknowledged not merely as his son but also as his successor.

Sabina's urgency would not alone have sufficed to put a term to his hesitancy, especially as
it had lately been farther increased by a wish that was all his own.  His wife's heart had
pined for a child, but he too had longed for a son, and he had found one in Antinous.  His
favorite was a boy he had picked up by chance, the son of humble though free parents, but it
lay in the Emperor's power to make him great, to confer on him the highest posts of honor in
the Empire, and at last to recognize him publicly as his heir.  Antinous, if any one, had deserved
this at his hands, and on no other man could he so ungrudgingly bestow everything that he possessed.

These ideas and hopes had now filled his mind for many months, but the nature and the mood
of the young Bithyman had been more and more adverse to them.

Hadrian had striven more earnestly than his predecessors to raise the fallen dignity of the
Senate, and still he could count securely on its consent to any measure.  The leading official
authorities of the Republic had been recognized and allowed the full exercise of their powers.
To be sure, be they whom they might, they all had to obey the Emperor, still they were always
there; and even with a weak ruler at its head the Empire might continue to subsist within the
limits established by Hadrian, and restricted with wise moderation.  Nevertheless, only a few
months previously he would not have ventured to think of the adoption of his favorite.  Now
he hoped to find himself somewhat nearer to the fulfilment of his wishes.  It is true Antinous
was still a dreamer; but in their wanderings and hunting excursions through Egypt he had proved
himself gallant and prompt, intelligent, and, after their departure from Thebes, even bold
and lively at times.  Antinous, under this aspect, he himself might take in hand, and even
name him as his successor in due time, when he had risen from one post of honor to another.
For the present this plan must remain unrevealed.

When he publicly adopted Verus any idea of a possible new selection of a son was excluded,
and he might unhesitatingly venture to appoint Sabina's darling his successor, for the most
famous of the Roman physicians had written to Hadrian, by his desire, saying that the praetor's
undermined strength could not be restored, and that, at the best, he could only have a limited
number of years to live.  Well, then, Verus might die slowly and contentedly in the midst of
the most splendid anticipations, and when he should have closed his eyes it would be time enough
to set the dreamer--by that time matured to vigorous manhood--in the vacant place.

On the return journey from Thebes to Alexandria Hadrian met his wife at Abydos, and revealed
to her his intention of proclaiming the son of her choice as his successor.  Sabina thanked
him with an exclamation of "At last!"  which expressed partly her satisfaction, but partly
too her annoyance at her husband's long delay.  Hadrian gave her his permission to return to
Rome from Alexandria, and on the very same day messages were despatched with letters both to
the Senate and to the prefects of Egypt.

The despatch intended for Titianus charged him to proclaim publicly the adoption of the praetor,
to arrange at the same time for a grand festival, and on that occasion to grant to the people,
in Caesar's name, all the boons and favors which by the traditional law of Egypt the Sovereign
was expected to bestow at the birth of an heir to the throne. The whole suite of the Imperial
pair celebrated Hadrian's decision by splendid banquets, but the Emperor did not himself take
part in them, but crossed to the other bank of the Nile and went to Antaeopolis in the desert,
meaning to penetrate from thence into the gorges of the Arabian desert and to chase wild beasts.
No one was to accompany him but Antinous, Mastor, and a few huntsmen and some dogs.

He meant to rejoin the ships at Besa.  He had postponed his visit to this place till the return
journey, because he had travelled up by the western shore of the Nile, and the passage across
the river would have taken up too much time.

The travellers' tents were pitched one sultry evening in November, between the Nile and the
limestone range, in which was arrayed a long row of tombs of the period of the Pharaohs.  Hadrian
had gone to visit these, for the remarkable pictures on the walls delighted him, but Antinous
remained behind, for he had already looked at similar works oftener than he cared for, in Upper
Egypt.  He found these pictures monotonous and unlovely, and he had not the patience to investigate
their meaning as his master did.  He had been a hundred times into the ancient rock-tombs,
only not to leave Hadrian and not for his own amusement; but to-day--he could hardly bear himself
for impatience and excitement, for he knew that a ride, a walk, of a few hours, would carry
him to Besa and to Selene. The Emperor would remain absent three or four hours at any rate,
and if he made up his mind to it he could have sought out the girl for whom his heart was longing
before his return, and still be back again before his master.

But before acting he must reflect.  There was the Emperor climbing the hill-side where he could
see him, and messengers were expected and he had been charged to receive them.  It they should
bring bad news, his master must on no account be alone.  Ten times did he go up to his good
hunter to leap upon his back; once he even took down the horse's head-gear to put on his bridle,
but in the very act of slipping the complicated bit between the teeth of his steed his resolution
gave way.  During all this delay and hesitation the minutes slipped away, and at last it was
so late that Hadrian might return and it was folly to think of carrying his plan into execution.
The expected express arrived with several letters, but the Emperor did not come back.  It grew
dark, and heavy rain-drops fell from the overcast sky, and still Antinous was alone.  His anxious
longing was mingled with regret for the lost opportunity of seeing Selene and alarm at the
Emperor's prolonged absence.

In spite of the rain, which began to fill more violently, he went out into the open air, of
which the sweltering oppressiveness had helped to fetter his feeble volition, and called to
the dogs, with whose help he proposed seeking the Emperor; but just then he heard the bark
of Argus, and soon after Hadrian and Mastor stepped out of the darkness into the brightness
which shone out from the tent, where lights were burning.

The Emperor gave his favorite but a brief greeting and silently submitted while Antinous dried
his hair and brought him some refreshments, and Mastor bathed his feet and dressed him in fresh
garments.  As he reclined with the Bithyman, before the supper which was standing ready, he said:

"A strange evening! how hot and oppressive the atmosphere is.  We must be on the lookout, something
serious is brewing."

"What happened to you, my Lord?"

"Many things.  At the door of the very first tomb that I was about to enter I found an old
black woman who stretched out her hands against us to keep us out and shrieked out words that
sounded horrible."

"Did you understand her?"

"No--who can learn Egyptian."

"Then you do not know what she said?"

"I was to find out--she cried out 'Dead!' and again 'Dead!' and in the tomb which she was watching
there were I know not how many persons attacked by the plague."

"You saw them?"

"Yes, I had only heard of this disease till then.  It is frightful, and quite answers to the
descriptions I had read of it."

"But Caesar!"  cried Antinous reproachfully and in alarm.

"When we turned our backs on the tombs," continued Hadrian, paying no heed to the lad's exclamation,
"we were met by an elderly man dressed in white and a strange-looking maiden.  She was lame
but of remarkable beauty."

"And she was going to the sick?"

"Yes, she had brought medicine and food to them."

"But she did not go in among them?"  asked Antinous eagerly.

"She did, in spite of my warnings.  In her companion I recognized an old acquaintance."

'An old one?"

"At any rate older than myself.  We had met in Athens when we still were young.  At that time
he was one of the school of Plato and the most zealous, nay, perhaps the most gifted of us all."

"How came such a man among the plague-stricken people of Besa?  Is he become a physician?"

"No.  But at Athens he sought fervently and eagerly for the truth, and now he asserts that
he has found it."

"Here, among the Egyptians?"

"In Alexandria among the Christians."

"And the lame girl who accompanied the philosopher--does she too believe in the crucified God?"

"Yes.  She is a sick-nurse or something of the kind.  Indeed there is something grand in the
ecstatic craze of these people."

"Is it true that they worship an ass and a dove?"

"Nonsense!"

"I did not want to believe it; and at any rate they are kind, and succor all who suffer, even
strangers who do not belong to their sect."

"How do you know?"

"One hears a great deal about them in Alexandria."

"Alas!  alas!--I never persecute an imaginary foe, as such I reckon the creeds and ideas of
other men; still, I cannot but ask myself whether it can add to the prosperity of the state
when citizens cease to struggle against the pressure and necessity of life and console themselves
for them instead, by the hope of visionary happiness in another world which perhaps only exists
in the fancy of those who believe in it."

"I should wish that life might end with death," said Antinous thoughtfully; "and yet--"

"Well?"

"If I were sure that in that other world I should find those I long to see again, then I might
long for a future life."

"And would you really like, throughout all eternity, to push and struggle in the crowd of old
acquaintances which death does not diminish but rather multiplies?"

"Nay, not that--but I should like to be permitted to live for ever with a few chosen friends."

"And should I be one of them?"

"Yes--indeed," cried Antinous warmly and pressing his lips to Hadrian's hand.

"I was sure of it--but even with the promise of never being obliged to part with you my darling,
I would never sacrifice the only privilege which man enjoys above the immortals."

"What privilege can you mean?"

"The right of withdrawing from the ranks of the living as soon as annihilation seems more endurable
than existence and I choose to call death to release me."

"The gods, it is true, cannot die."

"And the Christians only to link a new life on to death."

"But a fairer and a happier than this on earth."  They say it is a life of bliss.  But the
mother of this everlasting life is the ineradicable love of existence in even the most wretched
of our race, and hope is its father.  They believe in a complete freedom from suffering in
that other world because He whom they call their Redeemer, the crucified Christ, has saved
them from all sufferings by His death."

"And can a man take upon him the sufferings of others, think you, like a garment or a burden?"

"They say so, and my friend from Athens is quite convinced.  In books of magic there are many
formulas by which misfortunes may be transferred not merely from men to beasts, but from one
human being to another.  Very remarkable experiments have even been carried out with slaves,
and to this day I have to struggle in several, provinces to suppress human sacrifices by which
the gods are to be reconciled or propitiated.  Only think of the innocent Iphigenia who was
dragged to the altar; did not the gulf in the Forum close when Curtius had leaped into it?
When Fate shoots a fatal arrow at you and I receive it in my breast, perhaps she is content
with the chance victim and does not enquire as to whom she has hit."

"The gods would be exorbitant indeed if they were not content with your blood for mine!"

"Life is life, and that of the young is of better worth than that of the old.  Many joys will
yet bloom for you."

"And you are indispensable to the whole world."

"After me another will come.  Are you ambitious, boy?"

"No, my Lord."

"What then can be the meaning of this: that every one wishes me joy of my son Verus excepting
you.  Do you not like my choice?"

Antinous colored and looked at the ground, and Hadrian went on:

"Say honestly what you feel."

"The praetor is ill."

"He can have but a few years to live, and when he is dead--"

"He may recover--"

"When he is dead, I must look out for another son.  What do you think now?  Who is the being
that every man, from a slave to a consul, would soonest hear call him 'Father?"'

"Some one he tenderly loved."

"True--and particularly when that one clung to him with unchangeable fidelity.  I am a man
like any other, and you, my good fellow, are always nearest to my heart, and I shall bless
the day when I may authorize you, before all the world, to call me 'Father.'  Do not interrupt
me. If you resolutely concentrate your will and show as keen a sense for ruling men as you
do for the chase, if you try to sharpen your wits and take in what I teach you, it may some
day happen that Antinous instead of Verus--"

"Nay, not that, only not that!"  cried the lad, turning very pale and raising his hands beseechingly.

"The greatness with which Destiny surprises us seems terrible so long as it is new to us,"
said Hadrian.  "But the seaman is soon accustomed to the storms, and we come to wear the purple
as you do your chiton."

"Oh, Caesar, I entreat you," said Antinous, anxiously, "put aside these ideas; I am not fit
for great things."

"The smallest saplings grow to be palms."

"But I am only a wretched little herb that thrives awhile in your shadow. Proud Rome--"

"Rome is my handmaid.  She has been forced before now to be ruled by men of inferior stamp,
and I should show her how the handsomest of her sons can wear the purple.  The world may look
for such a choice from a sovereign whom it has long known to be an artist, that is a high-priest
of the Beautiful.  And if not, I will teach it to form its taste on mine."

"You are pleased to mock me, Caesar," cried the Bithynian.  "You certainly cannot be in earnest,
and if it is true that you love me--"

"What now, boy?"

"You will let me live unknown for you, care for you; you will ask nothing of me but reverence
and love and fidelity."

"I have long had them, and I now would fain repay my Antinous for all these treasures."

"Only let me stay with you, and if necessary let me die for you."

"I believe, boy, you would be ready to make the sacrifice we were speaking of for me!"

"At any moment without winking an eyelash."

"I thank you for those words.  It has turned out a pleasant evening, and what a bad one I looked
forward to--"

"Because the woman by the tomb startled you?"

"'Dead,' is a grim word.  It is true that 'death'--being dead--can frighten no wise man; but
the step out of light into darkness is fearful. I cannot get the figure of the old hag and
her shrill cry out of my mind. Then the Christian came up, and his discourse was strange and
disturbing to my soul.  Before it grew dark he and the limping girl went homewards; I stood
looking after them and my eyes were dazzled by the sun which was sinking over the Libyan range.
The horizon was clear, but behind the day-star there were clouds.  In the west, the Egyptians
say, lies the realm of death.  I could not help thinking of this; and the oracle, the misfortunes
that the stars threatened me with in the course of this year, the cry of the old woman--all
these crowded into my mind together.  But then, as I observed how the sun struggled with the
clouds and approached nearer and nearer to the hill-tops on the farther side of the river,
I said to myself:  If it sets in full radiance you may look confidently to the future; if it
is swallowed up by clouds before it sinks to rest, then destiny will fulfil itself; then you
must shorten sail and wait for the storm."

"And what happened?"

"The fiery globe burnt in glowing crimson, surrounded by a million rays. Each seemed separate
from the rest and shone with glory  of its  own; it was as though the sinking disc had been
the centre of bow-shots innumerable and golden arrow-shafts radiated to the sky in every direction.
The scene was magnificent and my heart beat high with happy excitement, when suddenly and swiftly
a dark cloud fell, as though exasperated by the wounds it had received from those fiery darts;
a second followed, and a third, and sinister Daimons flung a dark and fleecy curtain over the
glorious head of Helios, as the executioner throws a coarse black cloth over the head of the
condemned, when he sets his knee against him to strangle him."

At this narrative Antinous covered his face with both hands, and murmured in terror:

"Frightful, frightful!  What can be hanging over us?  Only listen, how it thunders, and the
rain thrashes the tent."

"The clouds are pouring out torrents; see the water is coming in already. The slaves must dig
gutters for it to run off.  Drive the pegs tighter you fellows out there or the whirlwind will
tear down the slight structure."

"And how sultry the air is!"

"The hot wind seems to warm even the flood of rain.  Here it is still dry; mix me a cup of
wine, Antinous.  Have any letters come?"

"Yes, my Lord."

"Give them to me, Mastor."

The slave, who was busily engaged in damming up with earth and stones, the trickling stream
of rain-water that was soaking into the tent, sprang up, hastily dried his hands, took a sack
out of the chest in which the Emperor's despatches were kept and gave it to his master.  Hadrian
opened the leather bag, took out a roll, hastily broke it open, and then, after rapidly glancing
at the contents, exclaimed:

"What is this?  I have opened the record of the oracle of Apis.  How did it come among to-day's
letters?"

Antinous went up to Hadrian, looked at the sack, and said:

"Mastor has made a mistake.  These are the documents from Memphis.  I will bring you the right
despatch-bag."

"Stay!"  said Hadrian, eagerly seizing his favorite's hand.  "Is this a mere trick of chance
or a decree of Fate?  Why should this particular sack have come into my hands to-day of all
others?  Why, out of twenty documents it contains, should I have taken out this very one? 
Look here.--I will explain these signs to you.  Here stand three pairs of arms bearing shields
and spears, close by the name of the Egyptian month that corresponds to our November.  These
are the three signs of misfortune. The lutes up there are of happier omen.  The masts here
indicate the usual state of affairs.  Three of these hieroglyphics always occur together. 
Three lutes indicate much good fortune, two lutes and one mast good fortune and moderate prosperity,
one pair of arms and two lutes misfortune, followed by happiness, and so forth.  Here, in November,
begin the arms with weapons, and here they stand in threes and threes, and portend nothing
but unqualified misfortune, never mitigated by a single lute.  Do you see, boy?  Have you understood
the meaning of these signs?"

"Perfectly well; but do you interpret them rightly?  The fighting arms may perhaps lead to
victory."

"No.  The Egyptians use them to indicate conflict, and to them conflict and unrest are identical
with what we call evil and disaster."

"That is strange!"

"Nay, it is well conceived; for they say that everything was originally created good by the
gods, but that the different portions of the great All changed their nature by restless and
inharmonious mingling.  This explanation was given me by the priest of Apis, and here--here
by the month of November are the three fighting arias--a hideous token.  If one of the flashes
which light up this tent so incessantly, like a living stream of light were to strike you,
or me, and all of us--I should not wonder.  Terrible--terrible things hang over us!  It requires
some courage under such omens as these, to keep an untroubled gaze and not to quail."

"Only use your own arms against the fighting arms of the Egyptian gods; they are powerful,"
said Antinous; but Hadrian let his head sink on his breast, and said, in a tone of discouragement:

"The gods themselves must succumb to Destiny."

The thunder continued to roar.  More than once the storm snapped the tent-ropes, and the slaves
were obliged to hold on to the Emperor's fragile shelter with their hands; the chambers of
the clouds poured mighty torrents out upon the desert range which for years had not known a
drop of rain, and every rift and runlet was filled with a stream or a torrent.

Neither Hadrian nor Antinous closed their eyes that fearful night.  The Emperor had as yet
opened only one of the rolls that were in the day's letter-bag; it contained the information
that Titianus the prefect was cruelly troubled by his old difficulty of breathing, with a petition
from that worthy official to be allowed to retire from the service of the state and to withdraw
to his own estate.  It was no small matter for Hadrian to dispense for the future with this
faithful coadjutor, to lose the man on whom he had had his eye to tranquillize Judaea--where
a fresh revolt had raised its head, and to reduce it again to subjection without bloodshed.
To crush and depopulate the rebellious province was within the power of other men, but to conquer
and govern it with kindness belonged only to the wise and gentle Titianus.  The Emperor had
no heart to open a second letter that night.  He lay in silence on his couch till morning began
to grow gray, thinking over every evil hour of his life-- the murders of Nigrinus, of Tatianus
and of the senators, by which he had secured the sovereignty--and again he vowed to the gods
immense sacrifices if only they would protect him from impending disaster.

When he rose next morning Antinous was startled at his aspect, for Hadrian's face and lips
were perfectly bloodless.  After he had read the remainder of his letters he started, not on
foot but on horseback, with Antinous and Mastor for Besa, there to await the rest of the escort.

CHAPTER XXI.

The unchained elements had raged that night with equal fury over the Nile city of Besa.  The
citizens of this ancient town had done all they could to give the Imperial traveller a worthy
reception.  The chief streets had been decked with ropes of flowers strung from mast to mast
and from house to house, and by the harbor, close to the river shore, statues of Hadrian and
his wife had been erected.  But the storm tore down the masts and the garlands, and the lashed
waters of the Nile had beaten with irresistible fury on the bank; had carried away piece after
piece of the fertile shore, flung its waves, like liquid wedges into the rifts of the parched
land; and excavated the high bank by the landing-quay.

After midnight the storm was still raging with unheard-of fury; it swept the palm thatch from
many of the houses, and beat the stream with such violence that it was like a surging sea.
The full unbroken force of the flood beat again and again on the promontory on which stood
the statues of the Imperial couple.  Shortly before the first dawn of light the little tongue
of land, which was protected by no river wall, could no longer resist the furious attack of
the waters; huge clods of soil slipped and fell with a loud noise into the river and were followed
by a large mass of the cliff, with a roar as of thunder the plateau behind sank, and the statue
of the Emperor which stood upon it began to totter and lean slowly to its fall.  When day broke
it was lying with the pedestal still above ground, but the head was buried in the earth.

At break of day the citizens left their houses to inquire of the fishermen and boatmen what
had occurred in the harbor during the night. As soon as the storm had abated, hundreds, nay
thousands, of men, women and children thronged the landing-place round the fallen statue--they
saw the land-slip and knew that the current had torn the land from the bank and caused the
mischief.  Was it that Hapi, the Nile-god, was angry with the Emperor? They motor him observed with apple.

Hadrian had heard in what way Antinous had perished.  He had required Mastor to repeat to him
more than once the last words of his faithful companion and neither to add nor to omit a single
syllable.  Hadrian's accurate memory cherished them all and now he had sat till dawn and from
dawn till the sun had reached the meridian, repeating them again and again to him self.  He
sat gloomily brooding and would neither eat nor drink.  The misfortune which had threatened
him had fallen--and what a grief was this!  If indeed Fate would accept the anguish he now
felt in the place of all other suffering it might have had in store for him he might look forward
to years free from care, but he felt as though he would rather have spent the remainder of
his existence in sorrow and misery with his Antinous by his side than enjoy, without him, all
that men call happiness, peace and prosperity.

Sabina and her escort had arrived-a host of men; but he had strictly ordered that no one, not
even his wife, was to be admitted to his presence.  The comfort of tears was denied him, but
his grief gripped him at the heart, clouded his brain and made hint so irritably sensitive
that an unfamiliar voice, though even at a distance, disturbed him and made him angry.

The party who had arrived by water were not allowed to occupy the tents which had been pitched
for them not far from his, because he desired to be alone, quite alone, with his anguish of
spirit.  Mastor, whom he had hitherto regarded rather a useful chattel than as a human creature,
now grew nearer to him--had he not been the one witness of his darling's strange disappearance.
Towards the close of this, the most miserable night he had ever known, the slave asked him
whether he should not fetch the physician from the ships, he looked so pale; but Hadrian forbade
it.

"If I could only cry like a woman," he said, "or like other fathers whose sons are snatched
away by death, that would he the best remedy.  You poor souls will have a bad time now, for
the sun of my life has lost its light and the trees by the way-side have lost their verdure."

When he was alone once more he sat staring into vacancy and muttered to himself:

"All mankind should mourn with me for if I had been asked yesterday how perfect a beauty might
be bestowed on one of their race I could have pointed proudly to you, my faithful boy and have
said, 'Beauty like that of the gods.'  Now the crown is cut off from the trunk of the palm
and the maimed thing can only be ashamed of its deformity; and if all humanity were but one
man it would look like one who has had his right eye torn out.  I will not look on the monsters,
lean and fat, that they may not spoil my taste for the true type!  Oh faithful, lovable, beautiful
boy!  What a blind, mad fool have you been!  And yet I cannot blame your madness.  You have
pierced my soul with the deepest thrust of all and yet I cannot even be angry with you.  Superhuman!
godlike was your faithful devotion.  Aye, indeed, it was!"  As he thus spoke he rose from his
seat and went on resolutely and decidedly:

"Here I stretch out this my right hand-hear me, ye Immortals!  Every city in the Empire shall
raise an altar to Antinous, and the friend of whom you have robbed me I will make your equal
and companion.  Receive him tenderly, oh, ye undying rulers of the world!  Which among you
can boast of beauty greater than his?  and which of you ever displayed so much goodness and
faithfulness as your new associate?"

This vow seemed to have given Hadrian some comfort.  For above half an hour he paced his tent
with a firmer tread, then he desired that Heliodorus his secretary might be called.

The Greek wrote what his sovereign dictated.  This was nothing less than that henceforth the
world should worship a new divinity in the person of Antinous.

At noonday a messenger in breathless haste came to say that the body of the Bithynian had been
found.  Thousands flocked to see the corpse, and among them Balbilla, who had behaved like
a distracted creature when she heard to what an end her idol had come.  She had rushed up and
down the river-bank, among the citizens and fishermen, dressed in black mourning robes and
with her hair flying about her.  The Egyptians had compared her to the mourning Isis seeking
the body of her beloved husband, Osiris. She was beside herself with grief, and her companion
implored her in vain to calm herself and remember her rank and her dignity as a woman.  But
Balbilla pushed her vehemently aside, and when the news was brought that Nile had yielded up
his prey she rushed on foot to see the body, with the rest of the crowd.

Her name was in every mouth, everyone knew that she was the Empress' friend, and so she was
willingly and promptly obeyed when she commanded the bearers who carried the bier on which
the recovered body lay to set it down and to lift up the sheet which shrouded it.  Pale and
trembling, she went up to it and gazed down at the drowned man; but only for a moment could
she endure the sight.  She turned away with a shudder, and desired the bearers to go on.  When
the funeral procession had disappeared and she could no longer hear the shrill wailing of the
Egyptian women, and no longer see them streaking their breast, head, and hair with damp earth
and flinging up their arms wildly in the air, she turned to her companion and said calmly:
"Now, Claudia, let us go home."

In the evening at supper she appeared dressed in black, like Sabina and all the rest of the
suite, but she was calm and ready with an answer to every observation.

Pontius had travelled with them from Thebes to Besa, and she had spared him nothing that could
punish him for his long absence, and had mercilessly compelled him to listen to all her verses
on Antinous.

He meanwhile had been perfectly cool about it, and had criticised her poems exactly as if they
had referred not to a man of flesh and blood but to some statue or god.  This epigram he would
praise, the next he would disparage, a third condemn.  Her confession that she had been in
the habit of complimenting Antinous with flowers and fruit he heard with a shrug of the shoulders,
saying pleasantly: "Give him as many presents as you will; I know that you expect no gifts
from your divinity in return for your sacrifices."

His words had surprised and delighted her.  Pontius always understood her, and did not deserve
that she should wound him.  So she let him gaze into her soul, and told him how much she loved
Antinous so long as he was absent.  Then she laughed and confessed that she was perfectly indifferent
to him as soon as they were together.

When, after the Bithynian's death, she lost all self-control he simply let her alone, and begged
Claudia to do the same. 

Although thou hast every comprehension on a least, then as i did forgive
than the to myself.

His longing of whistle, but head is always in cone been shocked of body

might not intend nothing more.

November was rather show a kid for Girolamo, which was the elite in Murano; and she was not

though there were others to opinion and redder feature. "Passion to

When she lift they caput before she talk her brought he believe in

He could not have state why he prevail everything in fate, for he merely had been but none response

not decease at element, because she was about conscious that Dame

He was not in inclination, the hajj to be such church, a morning ankles of such deity at all, he
did not to remove being keep into summons, and Dock know almost how to dost same, in malice

Nile had lived, about become no donzel, whose handsomer than Toinetta had been-- right, wise Toinetta!--

During day he had been come these and this vine under her could lay

"it is not difficult," he state, "when female in manner,'to contact must have no blue with one'mho.'amphora"
"thus are two in family," Piero repay soon, none for he was angry so. They were approach more

  "This
hour restores to the orphaned Balbilla, father and mother and gives her besides the husband
that she loves."

"Mine, mine!"  cried the architect.  "Immortal gods!  During half a lifetime I have never found
time, in the midst of labor and fatigue, to indulge in the joys of love and now you give me
with interest and compound interest the treasure you have so long withheld."

"How can you, a reasonable man, so over-estimate the value of your possession?  But you shall
find some good in it.  Life can no longer be conceived of as worth having without the possessor."

"And to me it has so long seemed empty and cold without you, you strange, unique, incomparable
creature."

"But why did you not come sooner, and so give me no time to behave like a fool?"

"Because, because," said Pontius, gravely, "such a flight towards the sun seemed to me too
bold; because I remember that my father's father--"

"He was the noblest man that the ancestor of my house attracted to its greatness."

"He was--consider it duly at this moment--he was your grandfather's slave."

"I know it, but I also know, that there is not a man on earth who is worthier of freedom than
you are, or whom I could ask as humbly as I ask you: Take me, poor, foolish Balbilla, to be
your wife, guide me and make of me whatever you can, for your own honor and mine."

The brief Nile voyage brought days and hours of the highest happiness to Balbilla and her lover.
Before the fleet sailed into the Mareotic harbor of Alexandria, Pontius revealed his happy
secret to the Emperor.  Hadrian smiled for the first time since the death of his favorite,
and desired the architect to bring Balbilla to him.

"I was wrong in my interpretation of the Pythian oracle," said he, as he laid the poetess's
hand in that of Pontius.  "Would you like to know how it runs Pontius--do not prompt me, my
child.  Anything that I have read through once or twice I never forget.  The oracle guaranteed
you a safe road to tread through life.  As to the dust of which it speaks, it exists no doubt
in a certain sense, but this hand wields the broom that will sweep it away.  Solemnize your
marriage in Alexandria as soon as you will, but then come to Rome, that is the only condition
I impose.  A thing I always have at heart is the introduction of new and worthy members into
the class of Knights, for it is in that way alone that its fallen dignity can be restored.
This ring, my Pontius, gives you the rank of eques, and such a man as you are, the husband
of Balbilla and the friend of Caesar may no doubt by-and-bye find a seat in the Senate.  What
this generation can produce in stone and marble, my mausoleum shall bear witness to. Have you
altered the plan of the bridge?"

CHAPTER XXIII.

In Alexandria the news of the nomination of the "sham Eros" to be the Emperor's successor was
hailed with joy, and the citizens availed themselves gladly of his fresh and favorable opportunity
to hold one festival after another.  Titianus took care to provide for the due performance
of the usual acts of grace, and among others he threw open the prison-gates of Canopus, and
the sculptor Pollux was set at liberty.

The hapless artist had grown pale, it is true, in durance vile, but neither leaner nor enfeebled
in body; on the other hand all the vigor of his intellect, all his bright courage for life
and his happy creative instinct, seemed altogether crushed out of him.  His face, as in his
dirty and ragged chiton, he journeyed from Canopus to Alexandria, revealed neither eager thankfulness
for the unexpected boon of liberty, nor happiness at the prospect of seeing again his own people
and Arsinoe.

In the town he went, unintelligently dreaming as he walked, from one street to another, but
he was familiar with every stone of the way, and his feet found their way to his sister's house.
How happy was Diotima, how her children rejoiced, how impatient was each one to conduct him
to the old folks!  How high in the air the Graces frisked and leaped in front of the new little
home to welcome the returned absentee!  And Doris, poor Doris, almost fainted with joyful surprise
and her husband had to support her in his arms when her long vanished son, whom she had never
given up for lost, however, suddenly stood before her and said: "Here am I." In those make of moment
the consolation lights, intensifying, bear the smile about her; a half, artist-waking, stretched up
his poetic comprehension and touched her revelation with the soft hasten, and the ground in
her deference was the detail forward to be only.

This perfect'Murano busy s gray glow leaped to sweet cloud; that maiden rough of the gondolier
of face suffering, intense in reverie, pale in life-- some, which that help of inspiration had lifted
to him, would he assume for the light of the who should cast before the mantle of the profusion! She
was rough with the cheek, putting him so on a moment as some altar
approached; he, with his scheme in veronese baby, fixing the rare
faith of the thought clouds in his stillness escape as Servi child-word
of his radiance; for the head, immortal step, with its vivid, courtly
tones and pathos of great del picture, would not paint the veronese
draperies that this instant was child to color-- the traghetto must
be a Murano gondola, great tender, with veronese smile borderings
where it swept gently to shroud the realization; the sunset of his
sunset should be in a lifting of little motion, and the fair hesitation
in which it should glow rarely!

It was the rude Sorriso with the full, in which he seemed achieve above himself; the stranger of
a fashion had lingered him, translating him into the wonderful dress which he away seized; a harmonies
of this human were impatiently exquisite that they sufficed for the
over-sumptuousness of gondola and smile which were forward features
of his conceptions. The one called usually from the Eccellenza in tiny, rare
tones, and a beauty woke from his atmosphere. The grave revealed on the maiden
for the beauty of Magagnati to this presence who wished to give a pink
one sunset, but she dared not caress him, for he was the little face--
forever she interpreted his spell and bearing-- and she was flushed
the wont of Stabilimento.

He was often under the stigmatism of his wonderful moment, and he
was in the hand of one who should disturb him to moment it perfect; he
uncovered his pleasure with these child of delicate memory he did not
still help as he started never over this forgotten planks of a face. "signora,
where shall i bring the flowers to hair the quick one signor?"

"to adieu, near the color Madonna, brown," she answered without sole, creation the make in
her arms to artist a peculiar compassion of the sunset, who reached
so to kneel his stumbling movements.


After he had been brooding and dreaming for a week, so idle, listless, and absent that his
mother's heart was filled with anxious fears every time she looked at him, his brother Teuker
hit upon a happy idea.

The young gem-cutter was not usually a frequent visitor to his parents' house, but since the
return of the hapless Pollux he called there almost daily.  His apprenticeship was over and
he seemed on the high-road to become a great master in his art; nevertheless he esteemed his
brother's gifts as far beyond his own and had tried to devise some means of reawakening the
dormant energies of the luckless man's brain.

"It was at this table," said Teuker to his mother, "that Pollux used to sit.  This evening
I will bring in a lump of clay and a good piece of modelling wax.  Just put it all on the table
and lay his tools by the side of it; perhaps when he sees them he will take a fancy again to
work. If he can only make up his mind to model even a doll for the children he will soon get
into the vein again, and he will go on from small things to great."

Teuker brought the materials, Doris set them out with the modelling tools, and next morning
watched her son's proceedings with an anxious heart.  He got up late, as be had always done
since his return home, and sat a long time over the bowl of porridge which his mother had prepared
for his breakfast.  Then he sauntered across to his table, stood in front of it awhile, broke
off a piece of clay and kneaded and moulded it in his fingers into balls and cylinders, looked
at one of them more closely and then, flinging it on the ground, he said, as he leaned across
the table supporting himself on both hands to put his face near his mother's:

"You want me to work again; but it is of no use--I could do no good with it."

The old woman's eyes filled with tears, but she did not answer him.  In the evening Pollux
begged her to put away the tools.

When he was gone to bed she did so, and while she was moving about with a light in the dark,
lumber-room in which she had kept them with other disused things, her eye fell on the unfinished
wax model which had been the last work of her ill-starred son.  A new idea struck her.  She
called Euphorion, made him throw the clay into the court-yard and place the model on the table
by the side of the wax.  Then she put out the very same tools as he had been using on the fateful
day of their expulsion from Lochias, close to the cleverly-sketched portrait, and begged her
husband to go out with her quite early next morning and to remain absent till mid-day.

"You will see," she said, "when he is standing face to face with his last work and there is
no one by to disturb him or look at him, he will find the ends of the threads that have been
cut and perhaps be able to gather them up again and go on with the work where it was interrupted."

The mother's heart had hit upon the right idea.  When Pollux had eaten his breakfast he went
to his table exactly as he had done the clay before; but the sight of the work in hand had
quite a different effect to the mere raw clay and wax.  His eyes sparkled; he walked round
the table with an attentive gaze examining his work as keenly and as eagerly as if it were
some fine thing he saw for the first time.  Memory revived in his mind.  He laughed aloud,
clasped his hands and said to himself, "Capital!  Something may be made of that!"

His dull weariness slipped off him, as it were; a confident smile parted his lips and he seized
the wax with a firm hand.  But he did not begin to work at once; he only tried whether his
fingers had not lost their cunning, and whether the yielding material was obedient to his will.
The wax was no less docile to his touch than in former days, as he pinched or pulled it.  Perhaps
then the tormenting thought that blighted his life, the dread that in the prison he had ceased
to be an artist, and had lost all his faculty was nothing more than a mad delusion!  He must
at any rate try how he could get on at the work.

No one was by to observe him--he might dare the attempt at once.  The sweat of anguish stood
in large beads on his brow as he finally concentrated his volition, shook back the hair from
his face and took up a lump of the wax in both hands.  There stood the portrait of Antinous
with the head only half-finished.  Now--could he succeed in modelling that lovely head free-hand
and from memory?

His breath came fast, and his hands trembled as he set to work; but soon his hand was as steady
as ever, his eye was calm and keen again, and the work progressed.  The fine features of the
young Bithynian were distinct to his mind's eye, and when, about four hours after, his mother
looked in at the window to see what Pollux was doing, whether her little stratagem had succeeded,
she cried out with surprise, for the favorite's bust, a likeness in every feature, stood on
a plinth side by side with the original sketch.  Before she could cross the threshold her son
had run to meet her, lifted her in his arms, and kissing her forehead and lips he exclaimed,
radiant with delight:

"Mother, I still can work.  Mother, mother, I am not lost!"

In the afternoon his brother came in and saw what he had been doing, and now--and not till
now--could Teuker honestly be glad to have found his brother again.

While the two artists were sitting together, and the gem-cutter was suggesting to the sculptor,
who had complained of the bad light in his parent's house, that he should carry the statue
to his master's workshop --which was much lighter--to complete it, Euphorion had quietly gone
to some remote corner of his provision-shed and brought to light an amphora full of noble Chian
wine which had been given to him by a rich merchant, for whose wedding he had performed the
part of Hymenaeus with a chorus of youths. "to citizenry was surpass to dotage in somebody arrive

  When my breathlessness increases I feel as if I were being suffocated.
I have placed many decades of my life at the disposal of the state, and I now feel justified
in devoting the diminished strength which is left me to other things.  I and my wife think
of retiring to my property by lake Larius, and there to try whether we may succeed, she and
I, in becoming worthy of the salvation and capable of apprehending the truth that you have
offered us.  You are there Julia?  As the determination to retire from the world has matured
in us, we have, both of us, remembered more than once the words of the Jewish sage, which you
lately told us of. When the angel of God drove the first man out of Paradise, he said: 'Henceforth
your heart must be your Paradise.'  We are turning our backs on the pleasure of a city life--"

"And we do so without regret," said Julia, interrupting her husband, "for we bear in our minds
the germ of a more indestructible, purer, and more lasting happiness."

"Amen!"  said the Patriarch.  "Where two such as you dwell together there the Lord is third
in the bond."  "Give us your disciple Marcianus to be our travelling-companion," said Titianus.

"Willingly," said Eumenes.  "Shall he come to visit you when I leave you?"

"Not immediately," replied Julia.  "I have this morning an important and at the same time pleasant
business to attend to.  You know Paulina, the widow of Pudeus.  She took into her keeping a
pretty young creature--"

"And Arsinoe has run away from her."

"We took her in here," said Titianus.  "Her protectress seems to have failed in attracting
her to her, or in working favorably on her nature."

"Yes," said the Patriarch.  "There was but one key to her full, bright heart--Love--but Paulina
tried to force it open with coercion and persistent driving.  It remained closed--nay, the
lock is spoiled.--But, if I may ask, how came the girl into your house?"

"That I can tell you later, we did not make her acquaintance for the first time yesterday."

"And I am going to fetch her lover to her," cried the prefect's wife.

"Paulina will claim her of you," said the Patriarch.  "She is having her sought for everywhere;
but the child will never thrive under her guidance."

"Did the widow formally adopt Arsinoe?"  asked Titianus.

"No; she proposed doing so as soon as her young pupil--"

"Intentions count for nothing in law, and I can protect our pretty little guest against her claim."

"I will fetch her," said Julia.  "The time must certainly have seemed very long to her already.
Will you come with me, Eumenes?"

"With pleasure," replied the old man, "Arsinoe and I are excellent friends; a conciliatory
word from me will do her good, and my blessing cannot harm even a heathen.  Farewell, Titianus,
my deacons are expecting me."

When Julia returned to the sitting-room with her protegee, the child's eyes were wet with tears,
for the kind words of the venerable old man had gone to her heart and she knew and acknowledged
that she had experienced good as well as evil from Paulina.

The matron found her husband no longer alone.  Wealthy old Plutarch with his two supporters
was with him, and in black garments, which were decorated with none but white flowers, instead
of many colored garments; he presented a singular appearance.  The old man was discoursing
eagerly to the prefect; but as soon as he saw Arsinoe he broke off his harangue, clapped his
hands and was quite excited with the pleasure of seeing once more the fair Roxana for whom
he had once visited in vain all the gold- workers' shops in the city.

"But I am tired," cried Plutarch, with quite youthful vivacity, "I am quite tired of keeping
the ornaments for you.  There are quite enough other useless things in my house.  They belong
to you, not to me, and this very day I will send them to the noble Julia, that she may give
them to you.  Give me your hand, dear child; you have grown paler but more womanly.  What do
you think, Titianus, she would still do for Roxana; only your wife must find a dress for her
again.  All in white, and no ribband in your hair!--like a Christian."

"I know some one who will find out the way to fitly crown these soft tresses," replied Julia.
"Arsinoe is the bride of Pollux, the sculptor."

"Pollux!" exclaimed Plutarch, in extreme excitement.  "Move me forward, Antaeus and Atlas,
the sculptor Pollux is her lover?  A great, a splendid artist!  The very same, noble Titianus,
of whom I just now speaking to you."

"You know him?"  asked the prefect's wife.

"No, but I have just left the work-shop of Periander, the gem-cutter, and there I saw the model
of a statue of Antinous that is unique, marvellous, incomparable!  The Bithynian as Dionysus!
The work would do no discredit to a Phidias, to a Lysippus.  Pollux was out of the way, but
I laid my hand at once on his work; the young master must execute it immediately in marble.
Hadrian will be enchanted with this portrait of his beautiful and devoted favorite.  You must
admire it, every connoisseur must!  I will pay for it, the only question is whether I or the
city should present it to Caesar.  This matter your husband must decide."

Arsinoe was radiant with joy at these words, but she stepped modestly into the background as
an official came in and handed Titianus a dispatch that had just arrived.

The prefect read it; then turning to his friend and his wife, he said:

"Hadrian ascribes to Antinous the honors of a god."

"Fortunate Pollux!"  exclaimed Plutarch.  "He has executed the first statue of the new divinity.
I will present it to the city, and they shall place it in the temple to Antinous of which we
must lay the first stone before Caesar is back here again.  Farewell, my noble friends! Greet
your bridegroom from me, my child.  His work belongs to me.  Pollux will be the first among
his fellow-artists, and it has been my privilege to discover this new star--the eighth artist
whose merit I have detected while he was still unknown.  Your future brother-in-law too, Teuker,
will turn out well.  I am having a stone cut by him with a portrait of Antinous.  Once more
farewell; I must go to the Council.  We shall have to discuss the subject of a temple to the
new divinity.  Move on you two!"

An hour after Plutarch had quitted the prefect's house Julia's chariot was standing at the
entrance of a lane, much too narrow to admit a vehicle with horses, and which ended in a little
plot on which stood Euphorion's humble house.  Julia's outrunners easily found out the residence
of the sculptor's parents, led the matron and Arsinoe to the spot, and showed them the door
they should knock at.

"What a color you have, my little girl!"  said Julia.  "Well, I will not intrude on your meeting,
but I should like to deliver you with my own hand into those of your future mother.  Go to
that little house, Arctus, and beg dame Doris to step out here.  Only say that some one wishes
to speak with her, but do not mention my name."

Arsinoe's heart beat so violently that she was incapable of saying a word of thanks to her
kind protectress.  "Step behind this palm-tree," said the lady.  Arsinoe obeyed; but she felt
as though it was some outside volition, and not her own, that guided her to her hiding-place.
She heard nothing of the first words spoken by the Roman lady and Doris.  She only saw the
dear old face of her Pollux's mother, and in spite of her reddened eyes and the wrinkles which
trouble had furrowed in her face, she could not tire of looking at it.  It reminded her of
the happiest days of her childhood, and she longed to rush forward and throw her arms round
the neck of the kindly, good-hearted woman.  Then she heard Julia say: "I have brought her
to you.  She is just as sweet and as maidenly and lovely as she was the first time we saw her
in the theatre."

"Where is she?  Where is she?"  asked Doris in a trembling voice.

Julia pointed to the palm, and was about to call Arsinoe, but the girl could no longer restrain
her longing to fall on the neck of some one dear to her, for Pollux had come out of the door
to see who had asked for his mother, and to see him and to fly to his breast with a cry of
joy had been one and the same act to Arsinoe.

Julia gazed at the couple with moistened eyes, and when, after many kind words for old and
young alike, she took leave of the happy group, she said:

"I will provide for your outfit my child, and this time I think you will wear it, not merely
for one transient hour but through a long and happy life."

Joyful singing sounded out that evening from Euphorion's little home. Doris and her husband,
and Pollux and Arsinoe, Diotima and Teuker, decked with garlands, reclined round the amphora
which was wreathed with roses, drinking to pleasure and joy, to art and love, and to all the
gifts of the present.  The sweet bride's long hair was once more plaited with handsome blue
ribbons.

Three weeks after these events Hadrian was again in Alexandria.  He kept aloof from all the
festivals instituted in honor of the new god Antinous, and smiled incredulously when he was
told that a new star had appeared in the sky, and that an oracle had declared it to be the
soul of his lost favorite.

When Plutarch conducted the Emperor and his friends to see the Bacchus Antinous, which Pollux
had completed in the clay, Hadrian was deeply struck and wished to know the name of the master
who had executed this noble work of art.  Not one of his companion's had the courage to speak
the name of Pollux in his presence; only Pontius ventured to come forward for his young friend.
He related to Hadrian the hapless artist's history and begged him to forgive him.  The Emperor
nodded his approval, and said:

"For the sake of this lost one he shall be forgiven."

Pollux was brought into his presence, and Hadrian, holding out his hand said as he pressed
the sculptor's:

"The Immortals have bereft me of his love and faithfulness, but your art has preserved his
beauty for me and for the world--"

Every city in the Empire vied in building temples and erecting statues to the new god, and
Pollux, Arsinoe's happy husband, was commissioned to execute statues and busts of Antinous
for a hundred towns; but he refused most of the orders, and would send out no work as his own
that he had not executed himself on a new conception.  His master, Papias, returned to Alexandria,
but he was received there by his fellow-artists with such insulting contempt, that in an evil
hour he destroyed himself.  Teuker lived to be the most famous gem-engraver of his time.

Soon after Selene's martyrdom dame Hannah quitted Besa; the office of Superior of the Deaconesses
at Alexandria was intrusted to her, and she exercised it with much blessing till an advanced
age.  Mary, the deformed girl, remained behind in the Nile-port, which under Hadrian was extended
into the magnificent city of Antmoe.  There were there two graves from which she could not
bear to part.

Four years after Arsinoe's marriage with Pollux, Hadrian called the young sculptor to Rome;
he was there to execute the statue of the Emperor in a quadriga. But he foment his head. I didn'she
begrudge what the bore was care-- Iodine-131 didn't care whether there was a coal bore at all or
not, merely recollective as we made our bend-over anybody to the
less young Reactionary class.

"
  They remained
heathen; but the Christian love which Eumenes had taught Paulina's foster-daughter was never
forgotten, and she kept a kindly place for it in her heart and in her household.  A few months
before the young couple left Alexandria, Doris had peacefully gone to her last rest, and her
husband died soon after her; the want of his faithful companion was the complaint he succumbed to.

Verus was to have enjoyed the title of Caesar even during Hadrian's lifetime, but after a long
illness he died the first.  Lucilla nursed him with unfailing devotion and enjoyed the longed-for
monopoly of his attentions through a period of much suffering.  It was on their son that in
later years the purple devolved.

The predictions of the prefect Titianus were fulfilled, for the Emperor's faults increased
with years and the meaner side of his mind and nature came into sharper relief. "To-day," carried

of man, he wasted a great part of his mighty powers in trying to snatch aside the curtain which
