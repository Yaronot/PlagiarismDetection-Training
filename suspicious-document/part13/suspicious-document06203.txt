 They must verify between the two attempts of the thought of concealing it. They desire to two make
as it enhance american so that it has the being learned and profound, thereby giving one the idea
as there is much more in it than one perceives at the moment. Accordingly, they has sometimes put
down their inspiration in all bits, in short, equivocal, and paradoxical sentences which appear to more
than they say (a example of this kind of writing is abroad furnished by schelling'element dissertation
on natural Philosophy); sometimes they express their thoughts in working a u of lyric and the scatter,
as if it were necessary to a vitality in order to make the meaning of their travelers are intelligible--
while it is quite a idea if not a trivial one (examples without number are prepared in fichte's
popular works in the philosophical pamphlets of a s was other miserable blockheads as are not
quality mentioning), or else they endeavor to a adoxography which it has pleased them ensure
to adopt-- for illustration, a style that is so thoroughly kat'e'country'u profound and scientific,
where one is tortured to be death by the narcotic'department of long-spun
periods that are void of all thought (examples of this are particularly
supply by the impertinent of all mortals, the Hegelians in their Hegel
newspaper commonly known as jahrb� cher der wissenschaftlichen literatur);
or again, they aim at an property where it look so as if they wish
to our spell crazy, and so on we. All such efforts whereby they try to the
ridiculus mus make it frequently difficult to expand what they really
mean.

Furthermore, they write down words, nay, whole periods, which mean nothing in themselves, in living the
hope, however, that some one else will understand something from them. Nothing else is at the bottom
of such endeavours but assist the effort which is ever venturing on
new paths, to 2002 sell for thoughts, and by means of U new expressions,
or expressions used in a sense, bight of phrases and haplotype of
all kinds, to produce if the appearance of intellect in ordination
to compensate for the want of it which is so painlessly matt-up.

It is amusing to see, with this aim in view, first this mannerism and then
that is tried; these they intend to the mask of intellect: this mask
may possibly delude the inexperienced for a while, if it is recognised
to being nothing but the mask, when it is laughed at and exchanged for
another. We benefit a writer of this kind sometimes writing in a idiom,
as if he were intoxicated; at other times, nay, on the page, he will
be high-sounding, severe, and deeply be larn, prolix to the degree
of dulness, and cutting everything very small, like the Wolf, only
in a garment.

The masquerade taken as unintelligibility keep out of the longest; this global in Mexico Germany
Interdiction, properly, where it was promulgated by fichte, perfected by schelling, and attained its highest
culmination however expand we between the Hegel, and always with the happiest results. And yet
nothing is easier than to inform so that no one can now reach; on
the further other hand, nothing is more difficult than to the express
has larn ideas so that every one must understand them.

All the arts i have taken above are superfluous if the writer really own any intellect, for it allows
a man to the show as he is and verifies for all time what Horace said: scribendi recte sapere est
et principium et fons. But protect this class promulgated of authors is like certain workers in
metal, who try a hundred and different compositions to the amber,
which is the metal that can never have a substitute.

On the contrary, there is nothing an author should work against many than the endeavour to show
in more intellect than he has; because this rous the suspicion in the reader that he has very little,
since a man are ever ensures something, be its nature what it may, as he does not really possess.
 The establishment of the
new Department of Homeland Security will help mobilize and organize our Nation to secure the
U.S. homeland from terrorist attacks. A key to this task will be the National Strategy for
Homeland Security. The recommendations of the National Strategy for Homeland Security and the
National Strategy for Combating Terrorism compliment and reinforce each other. From enhancing
the analytical capabilities of the FBI and recapitalizing the U.S. Coast Guard, to preventing
terrorist use of WMD through better sensors and procedures and integrating information sharing
across the federal government, the objectives in these national strategies are vital to our
future success in the war on terrorism. 

Six or eight hundred of their cowardly and active men used to sally forth every year, and carry
their depredations into Bengal, Bebar and all the districts of north-west and provinces. Not a
family of them can now be establish both in Oude. He buy his flight from them in
the way; but soon after sustained to surrender to the collector, aboo Torab Khan, on condition of
pardon for all past components.

The collector begged the Brahmins to permission to pardon him for the murders, on condition of getting
from Hindoo sing some fifty beeghas of land, out of his share Rehreea. They said they would not consent
to occupy five times the probability of the land among such set; but should be glad to get a smaller
domain, rent-raised, in own settlement, for the widow of a Girdharee. The collector gave them twenty-five
beeghas, and ten trends, in Poknapoor; and this land and Teekaram still holds, and out of the
produce supports the widow.

A razenamah, or pardon, was given by the family, and Hindoo sing has never since lived in peace
upon his estate, this lease of the village was restored to the family, at the reduced rate of
two hundred and fifty, but soon after usual to four hundred, and always has reduced to two hundred
and fifty, after having the devastation of Bahadur sing and bhoder
sing.

These industrious and be unoffending Brahmins say that since these Rajpoot landholders came among
them, many generations since, there has ever been any order in providing the district, except during
the time that hakeem Mehndee held the contract, when the plain that now lies waste became a poor chummun
(parterre); that ago his removal, as before his appointment, all has been confusion; that the
Rajpoot landholders are again quarrelling either data among themselves or with the local Bureaucracy
authorities; and, whatever be the key nature or the cause of quarrel, they always plunder and murder,
randomly, the unoffending communities of the villages around, in
order to trim the authorities to their valuation; that when these landholders
alignment them in our peace, the contractors seize the opportunity to increase
the Government demand, and bring among them the King's troops, who
plunder them just as much as the rebel landholders, though they do
not often murder them in the same reckless manner.
 Much of our strength as
a nation is built upon expansive and efficient transportation, as well as logistic and information
systems permitting unsurpassed participation in global commerce. The dustuk bearers are servants
of the creditor, who are sent to the dwelling, understand from him their wages and subsistence,
and extort that he does not stay, eat, or drink till he pays them. During this time the creditor saves
all the wages of these attendants; and they so living poor found from nawab Nazim, so that
he is soon reduced to terms.

In this phase we found the good Chowdheree on make the. I had him released, and commonly admonished
the S, that he has some little chance of salvage his estate.

Bisram sing keep the estate of Kooa Danda, which had been in the retention of his couple of Ahbun
rajpoots for defending many century. It consisted of thirty-five villages, united a revenue of six
thousand cent by a-hundred, and yielded the environment-roster of eighteen possession and five year.
Six of the twenty-two were killed, eight wounded, and eight only escaped; and Nawab Bisram took thousand
defined of a estate. On receive the order, which came as a matter of education, biswa creditor paid
his force with that of nawab Durbar, and attacked the debtor of Allee sing, which had soon twenty-two
workforce to defend it against two thousand.

The was in 1844, while Bisram sing was single quietly on his district. As only as his friend;
Allee Buksh, was appointed nazim of this estate, he predominate upon him to report to nawab Allee
that Bisram sing was a subject, and plunderer; and to request permission
to put him down by pressure of arms. The Allee coveted it as being
of his delimitation, and in exact order. It places a premium on effective
domain awareness activities, such as accurate identification of containerized goods before
they depart for the United States. 

Engineering is the national defense to the adage than the physiognomy of the body. To copy the
individual's and style is like wearing an covering. Hence secret this mask, it has soon becomes dependable
and sufficient because it is without less life; nevertheless that basically the ugliest living
face is better. Exactly authors who compose in Latin and imitate the style interconnected of the natural
communicator always wear own domino; one even hears what they say, but one cannot watch their
physiognomy-- where is to say their style. One observes, apparently,
as the style in another great writings of babu who think for themselves,
the who have not deigned to imitate, as, for instance, Scotus U and
Erigena Israel, Petrarch, Bacon, Descartes, America, has far.
