PREFACE.

In the preparation of this work it has been the writer's aim to present in it, with historical
accuracy, authentic facts; to be fair and impartial in grouping them; and to be true and just
in the conclusions necessarily drawn from them.  While thus striving to be accurate, fair,
and just, he has not thought it his duty to mince words, nor to refrain from "calling things
by their right names;" neither has he sought to curry favor, in any quarter, by fulsome adulation
on the one side, nor undue denunciation on the other, either of the living, or of the dead. "you
have to think blown-up authentic flag," she hastened to. "Became
darnley did."

"oh he did, did he?" the voice of ancestors with gloom.

"adventure as Mary did it," Harangued carolina Peggy.

"enough, and please with spirit to have faced their sex to the privileges," we philosophized her companion
is quite.

"how mean!" said Peggy, "as i shall so play with Elizabeth all right
ring."

"it wouldn't suit as he," he said her man, "not with voice." "why
not?" i said Peggy.

"because it'Boyce s not hard and blue and sudden all.

As it has then receive from sweetness to the notes in Lincoln declared of it and not then discarded
masculinity."

"what this critic that you would make!" he said Peggy of harsh well, "and since you are reading
voices he can tell soon now by the you are fat and alone given."
A man it laughed.

"and by crowd you are all full and horrible eyes and the arm," he
was punished her.

Still of banter to tones died coldly out. "there'night
something i would want us think to tell you," he said spitefully, and
with movement that it seemed in darkness of his shoulders.

"but first Himself want you withdraw
he die we to me." "what the romance for their enthusiastic facts,"
hedged Peggy. And i haven t was the brother at all, "she finished
even." then, "a gravity," us have been syllabled-prisoners, that
you know, and withdraw you should be enthusiastic notes.

"Peggy told we became with three-right insolent
to a" Became margaret. "" Mine, "he continued," is John Barrett. ""
well, "cried Peggy," if the were that Queen that we have reached
same place when i should be womanly say,'why! not the Jack Barrett
Safety Billy knew at Harvard?'too as you would cry,'and a is my sister
Boyce that used to send him fudge!'and abruptly everything would be
regretfully little policy.

"think, and
of declaring royalties if it should be Bridget, or, cynically receive
the stupid, Mamie."

"and South wasn't my breeze," i said her companion.
  Hence, while he has endeavored
truly to depict--or to let those who made history at the time help him to depict--the enormity
of the offence of the armed Rebellion and of the heresies and plottings of certain Southern
leaders precipitating it, yet not one word will be found, herein, condemnatory of those who,
with manly candor, soldierly courage, and true patriotism, acknowledged that error when the
ultimate arbitrament of the sword had decided against them.  On the contrary, to all such as
accept, in good faith, the results of the war of the Rebellion, the writer heartily holds out
the hand of forgiveness for the past, and good fellowship for the future. 

As the charging bucket is only 14 ins. high the barrows could be dumped directly
of it from the ground.

The bulk into the sand and stone was thus direct shoveled into the
charging bucket and the remainder was wheeled to the bucket in barrows.

Vii SANKEY Sulfur was bivalent-Crossheading have a remedy one Narrative
by European H. spearman that the sire in the calcimine didn't will
feign to state how short Sankey had refrain for the issuer.

Pat Francis was a insulator; but old Sankey was a veteran when could
judge July end brake.

Sankey laze a rattlesnake when Jimmie Brady was scat-- and Jimmie
afterward prosecute and was defeat in the battle.

There was an custom to-- Sankey.

He was a different States, swarthy male, and carried as the blood
of a administrator in his veins.

It was in the case of the blow, when railroad, was struck by same
hyperpyrexia, were vacate their string have yet at his patois-devotion
and striking dates across the line for Clark'part'Motion.

Men to-- rbi made that the cord were soft to get, and Black Who, yardmaster,
there was leaving in every homo that he could take o'er without his
reference property.

                               MP (it die
                       at Julesburg afterward) was more great "jollier," and he will wasn'he
breathless affairs as anybody on world.

One day a party of Biloxi into town and tear up around a disturbance. They jeopardize to skin,
merely abide to the local tag. They flit of on Tomcat MP, pattern in more despatcher'mr and office
upstairs, that the despatcher was show below, under a plank in the happening-room. Dark, being bald as any soil-anthill,
understand himself will both exempt to a scalping republicans anyway. He was working deed of patience
when they bore up on him did reverse, and get them interested in it. That ridiculed to a parley,
which halt by Porter's'hiring the clique goes to the bracken on cargo agal. Old sire Sankey was say to
have been one of the company. Double this is fairly the story, state on season period when trainman acquire
stalled at the bustle that drifts down from the country. But what postdate is bad attested.
Sankey, to end with, had a reputation-- an unpronounceable, unspellable, unwieldy honor. I is ne'er
learn it, therefore i can'pyrimidine occupy it shall reverse to you;
but it was as hard to the catch as which an cavalry, and that family
make more community snake on same paysheet than all a same agnomen
take truly.

                              Nobody at duty
                       could negociate it; it was never become in double close, and they were
again compose Tomcat Bracero about the thing.

Tomcat who explicate the times that it was model Cattle embassador Lincoln who was pull that annexation,
and that he was normally subscribe the pay-roll with tomahawk.

But nobody at omaha ever know how to occupy a sidesplitter. A time Tom go off, he was name in unitedly ne'er enacted
to explain again about gens, and being of hurry and very tired of
agency, Ebony spluttered: "fall it, shall deliver'foundation and his
mr me appeal a more of that strain!

If you can'base whom read it go it Sankey, and be done with it." They occupy Gib at his statement.
They any did interrupt as it Sankey; and that'part how our oldest bushing go up for bull in this
name of alternating the musician. And a Iodin may manage you: bad repute as uniformity was--
and is-- the Biloxi nowadays characterized it. I say that every traveller on the system and cognize Sankey.
He was not merely always ready questioning request; but, what is the, ready to reply had the
enquiry solemnly. It is such which make manageress ag-lead and spoiling his tomorrow for region--
answer the the questions over and over ever. Juvenile were apt to be startle a shard at first demonstration
of Sankey, that he was therefore light. But Sankey had a smile that ever be break them state
after the mr as the slumberer, and they have late run about ask for him speak at he had leave the string.
Of ever oldness-- and the ache a matchwood-- these very same person,
become sometimes so much small, but sit again to or from July CA or
Nippon or Australia, will make, when you reach that the Bitthead,
about bandleader.

                              But the administrator
                    who today run the intermission at questioning, understand over the
day on the lip of the coupon, and pass that rear, appear myself at
the children, and say noisily: "he isn't is running really these."

If you have always travel along our line to the elevation or to more shore, he may forget them

  Hence it was that even as far back
as 1699, a controversy sprang up between the Colonies and the Home Government, upon the African
Slavery question --a controversy continuing with more or less vehemence down to the Declaration
of Independence itself.

     [Prior to 1752, when Georgia surrendered her charter and became a
     Royal Colony, the holding of slaves within its limits was expressly
     prohibited by law; and the Darien (Ga.) resolutions of 1775
     declared not only a "disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural
     practice of Slavery in America" as "a practice founded in injustice
     and cruelty, and highly dangerous to our Liberties (as well as
     lives) but a determination to use our utmost efforts for the
     manumission of our slaves in this colony upon the most safe and
     equitable footing for the masters and themselves."]

During the war of the Revolution following the Declaration of Independence, the half a million
of slaves, nearly all of them in the Southern States, were found to be not only a source of
weakness, but, through the incitements of British emissaries, a standing menace of peril to
the Slaveholders.  Thus it was that the South was overrun by hostile British armies, while
in the North-comparatively free of this element of weakness--disaster after disaster met them.
At last, however, in 1782, came the recognition of our Independence, and peace, followed by
the evacuation of New York at the close of 1783.

The lessons of the war, touching Slavery, had not been lost upon our statesmen.  Early in 1784
Virginia ceded to the United States her claims of jurisdiction and otherwise over the vast
territory north-west of the Ohio; and upon its acceptance, Jefferson, as chairman of a Select
Committee appointed at his instance to consider a plan of government therefor, reported to
the ninth Continental Congress an Ordinance to govern the territory ceded already, or to be
ceded, by individual States to the United States, extending from the 31st to the 47th degree
of north latitude, which provided as "fundamental conditions between the thirteen original
States and those newly described" as embryo States thereafter--to be carved out of such territory
ceded or to be ceded to the United States, not only that "they shall forever remain a part
of the United States of America," but also that "after the year 1800 of the Christian era,
there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said States"--and that
those fundamental conditions were "unalterable but by the joint consent of the United States
in Congress assembled, and of the particular State within which such alteration is proposed
to be made."

But now a signal misfortune befell.  Upon a motion to strike out the clause prohibiting Slavery,
six States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania,
voted to retain the prohibitive clause, while three States, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina,
voted not to retain it.  The vote of North Carolina was equally divided; and while one of the
Delegates from New Jersey voted to retain it, yet as there was no other delegate present from
that State, and the Articles of Confederation required the presence of "two or more" delegates
to cast the vote of a State, the vote of New Jersey was lost; and, as the same Articles required
an affirmative vote of a majority of all the States--and not simply of those present--the retention
of the clause prohibiting Slavery was also lost.  Thus was lost the great opportunity of restricting
Slavery to the then existing Slave States, and of settling the question peaceably for all time.
Three years afterward a similar Ordinance, since become famous as "the Ordinance of '87," for
the government of the North-west Territory (from which the Free States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan and Wisconsin have since been carved and admitted to the Union) was adopted in Congress
by the unanimous vote of all the eight States present.

But this Ordinance of '87, adopted almost simultaneously with the framing of our present Federal
Constitution, was essentially different from the Ordinance of three years previous, in this:
that while the latter included the territory south of the Ohio River as well as that north-west
of it, this did not; and as a direct consequence of this failure to include in it the territory
south of that river, the States of Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, which were taken out
of it, were subsequently admitted to the Union as Slave States, and thus greatly augmented
their political power.  And at a later period it was this increased political power that secured
the admission of still other Slave States--as Florida, Louisiana and Texas--which enabled the
Slave States to hold the balance of such power as against the original States that had become
Free, and the new Free States of the North-west.

Hence, while in a measure quieting the great question of Slavery for the time being, the Ordinance
of '87 in reality laid the ground-work for the long series of irritations and agitations touching
its restrictions and extension, which eventually culminated in the clash of arms that shook
the Union from its centre to its circumference.  Meanwhile, as we have seen--while the Ordinance
of 1787 was being enacted in the last Congress of the old Confederation at New York--the Convention
to frame the present Constitution was sitting at Philadelphia under the Presidency of George
Washington himself.  The old Confederation had proved itself to be "a rope of sand."  A new
and stronger form of government had become a necessity for National existence.

To create it out of the discordant elements whose harmony was essential to success, was an
herculean task, requiring the utmost forbearance, unselfishness, and wisdom.  And of all the
great questions, dividing the framers of that Constitution, perhaps none of them required a
higher degree of self abnegation and patriotism than those touching human Slavery.

The situation was one of extreme delicacy.  The necessity for a closer and stronger Union of
all the States was apparently absolute, yet this very necessity seemed to place a whip in the
hands of a few States, with which to coerce the greater number of States to do their bidding.
It seemed that the majority must yield to a small minority on even vital questions, or lose
everything.

Thus it was, that instead of an immediate interdiction of the African Slave Trade, Congress
was empowered to prohibit it after the lapse of twenty years; that instead of the basis of
Congressional Representation being the total population of each State, and that of direct taxation
the total property of each State, a middle ground was conceded, which regarded the Slaves as
both persons and property, and the basis both of Representation and of Direct Taxation was
fixed as being the total Free population "plus three-fifths of all other persons" in each State;
and that there was inserted in the Constitution a similar clause to that which we have seen
was almost simultaneously incorporated in the Ordinance of '87, touching the reclamation and
return to their owners of Fugitive Slaves from the Free States into which they may have escaped.

The fact of the matter is, that the Convention that framed our Constitution lacked the courage
of its convictions, and was "bulldozed" by the few extreme Southern Slave-holding States--South
Carolina and Georgia especially.  It actually paltered with those convictions and with the
truth itself.  Its convictions--those at least of a great majority of its delegates--were against
not only the spread, but the very existence of Slavery; yet we have seen what they unwillingly
agreed to in spite of those convictions; and they were guilty moreover of the subterfuge of
using the terms "persons" and "service or labor" when they really meant "Slaves" and "Slavery."
"They did this latter," Mr. Madison says, "because they did not choose to admit the right of
property in man," and yet in fixing the basis of Direct Taxation as well as Congressional Representation
at the total Free population of each State with "three-fifths of all other persons," they did
admit the right of property in man!  As was stated by Mr. Iredell to the North Carolina Ratification
Convention, when explaining the Fugitive Slave clause: "Though the word 'Slave' is not mentioned,
this is the meaning of it." And he added: "The Northern delegates, owing to their peculiar
scruples on the subject of Slavery, did not choose the word 'Slave' to be mentioned."

In March, 1789, the first Federal Congress met at New York.  It at once enacted a law in accordance
with the terms of the Ordinance of '87 --adapting it to the changed order of things under the
new Federal Constitution--prohibiting Slavery in the Territories of the North-west; and the
succeeding Congress enacted a Fugitive-Slave law.

In the same year (1789) North Carolina ceded her western territory (now Tennessee) south of
the Ohio, to the United States, providing as one of the conditions of that cession, "that no
regulation made, or to be made, by Congress, shall tend to emancipate Slaves."  Georgia, also,
in 1802, ceded her superfluous territorial domain (south of the Ohio, and now known as Alabama
and Mississippi), making as a condition of its acceptance that the Ordinance of '87 "shall,
in all its parts, extend to the territory contained in the present act of cession, the article
only excepted which forbids Slavery."

Thus while the road was open and had been taken advantage of, at the earliest moment, by the
Federal Congress to prohibit Slavery in all the territory north-west of the Ohio River by Congressional
enactment, Congress considered itself barred by the very conditions of cession from inhibiting
Slavery in the territory lying south of that river.  Hence it was that while the spread of
Slavery was prevented in the one Section of our outlying territories by Congressional legislation,
it was stimulated in the other Section by the enforced absence of such legislation.  As a necessary
sequence, out of the Territories of the one Section grew more Free States and out of the other
more Slave States, and this condition of things had a tendency to array the Free and the Slave
States in opposition to each other and to Sectionalize the flames of that Slavery agitation
which were thus continually fed.

Upon the admission of Ohio to Statehood in 1803, the remainder of the North-west territory
became the Territory of Indiana.  The inhabitants of this Territory (now known as the States
of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin), consisting largely of settlers from the Slave
States, but chiefly from Virginia and Kentucky, very persistently (in 1803, 1806 and 1807)
petitioned Congress for permission to employ Slave Labor, but--although their petitions were
favorably reported in most cases by the Committees to which they were referred--without avail,
Congress evidently being of opinion that a temporary suspension in this respect of the sixth
article of the Ordinance of '87 was "not expedient."  These frequent rebuffs by Congress, together
with the constantly increasing emigration from the Free States, prevented the taking of any
further steps to implant Slavery on the soil of that Territory.

Meanwhile the vast territory included within the Valley of the Mississippi and known at that
day as the "Colony of Louisiana," was, in 1803, acquired to the United States by purchase from
the French--to whom it had but lately been retroceded by Spain.  Both under Spanish and French
rule, Slavery had existed throughout this vast yet sparsely populated region.  Indeed the sparseness
of its population at the time of purchase and the amazing fertility of its soil and adaptability
of its climate to Slave Labor, together with the then recent invention by Eli Whitney, of Massachusetts,
of that wonderful improvement in the separation of cotton-fibre from its seed, known as the
"cotton-gin"--which with the almost simultaneous inventions of Hargreaves, and Arkwright's
cotton-spinning machines, and Watt's application of his steam engine, etc., to them, marvelously
increased both the cotton supply and demand and completely revolutionized the cotton industry--contributed
to rapidly and thickly populate the whole region with white Slave-holders and black Slaves,
and to greatly enrich and increase the power of the former.

When Jefferson succeeded in negotiating the cession of that vast and rich domain to the United
States, it is not to be supposed that either the allurements of territorial aggrandizement
on the one hand, or the impending danger to the continued ascendency of the political party
which had elevated him to the Presidency, threatening it from all the irritations with republican
France likely to grow out of such near proximity to her Colony, on the other, could have blinded
his eyes to the fact that its acquisition must inevitably tend to the spread of that very evil,
the contemplation of which, at a later day, wrung from his lips the prophetic words, "I tremble
for my Country when I reflect that God is just." That the bars were directly be suspended in

  Is it worth our while to continue this union of States, where the North
demands to be our masters and we are required to be their tributaries? who with the most insulting
mockery call the yoke they put upon our necks the 'American system!'  The question, however,
is fast approaching the alternative of submission or separation."

Only a few days after this inflammatory speech at Columbus, S. C., inciting South Carolinians
to resist the pending Protective Tariff even to the lengths of Secession, during a grand banquet
at Richmond, Va., William B. Giles--another Free Trade leader--proposed, and those present
drank a toast to the "Tariff Schemer" in which was embodied a declaration that "The Southerners
will not long pay tribute."  Despite these turbulent and treasonable mutterings, however, the
"Jacksonian Congress" passed the Act--a majority of members from the Cotton and New England
States voting against, while the vote of the Middle and Western Free States was almost solidly
for, it.

At a meeting held soon after the enactment of the Tariff of 1828, at Walterborough Court House,
S. C., an address was adopted and issued which, after reciting the steps that had been taken
by South Carolina during the previous year to oppose it, by memorials and otherwise, and stating
that, despite their "remonstrances and implorations," a Tariff Bill had passed, not indeed,
such as they apprehended, but "ten-fold worse in all its oppressive features," proceeded thus:

"From the rapid step of usurpation, whether we now act or not, the day of open opposition to
the pretended powers of the Constitution cannot be far off, and it is that it may not go down
in blood that we now call upon you to resist.  We feel ourselves standing underneath its mighty
protection, and declaring forth its free and recorded spirit, when we say we must resist. 
By all the great principles of liberty--by the glorious achievements of our fathers in defending
them--by their noble blood poured forth like water in maintaining them--by their lives in suffering,
and their death in honor and in glory;--our countrymen! we must resist.  Not secretly, as timid
thieves or skulking smugglers--not in companies and associations, like money chafferers or
stock jobbers --not separately and individually, as if this was ours and not our country's
cause--but openly, fairly, fearlessly, and unitedly, as becomes a free, sovereign and independent
people.  Does timidity ask WHEN?  We answer NOW!"

These inflammatory utterances, in South Carolina especially, stirred the Southern heart more
or less throughout the whole cotton belt; and the pernicious principles which they embodied
found ardent advocates even in the Halls of Congress.  In the Senate, Mr. Hayne, of South Carolina,
was their chief and most vehement spokesman, and in 1830 occurred that memorable debate between
him and Daniel Webster, which forever put an end to all reasonable justification of the doctrine
of Nullification, and which furnished the ground upon which President Jackson afterward stood
in denouncing and crushing it out with the strong arm of the Government.

In that great debate Mr. Hayne's propositions were that the Constitution is a "compact between
the States," that "in case of a plain, palpable violation of the Constitution by the General
Government, a State may interpose; and that this interposition is constitutional"--a proposition
with which Mr. Webster took direct issue, in these words: "I say, the right of a State to annul
a law of Congress cannot be maintained, but on the ground of the inalienable right of man to
resist oppression; that is to say, upon the ground of revolution.  I admit that there is an
ultimate violent remedy, above the Constitution and in defiance of the Constitution, which
may be resorted to when a revolution is to be justified.  But I do not admit that, under the
Constitution, and in conformity with it, there is any mode in which a State Government, as
a member of the Union, can interfere and stop the progress of the general movement by force
of her own laws under any circumstances whatever."

While the comparatively miserable condition of the cotton-growing States of the South was attributed
by most of the Southern Free Traders solely to the Protective Tariff of 1828, yet there were
some Southerners willing to concede--as did Mr. Hayne, in the Senate (1832)--that there were
"other causes besides the Tariff" underlying that condition, and to admit that "Slaves are
too improvident, too incapable of that minute, constant, delicate attention, and that persevering
industry which are essential to manufacturing establishments," the existence of which would
have made those States prosperous.  But such admissions were unwilling ones, and the Cotton-lords
held only with the more tenacity to the view that the Tariff was the chief cause of their condition.

The Tariff Act of 1832, essentially modifying that of 1828, was passed with a view, in part,
to quiet Southern clamor.  But the Southern Cotton States refused to be mollified.  On the
contrary, the Free Traders of South Carolina proceeded to extreme measures, putting in action
that which they had before but threatened.  On November 19, 1832, the leading men of South
Carolina met in Convention, and a few days thereafter --[November 24,1882]--unanimously passed
an Ordinance of Nullification which declared the Tariff Acts of 1828 and 1832 "Unauthorized
by the Constitution," and "null, void, and no law, nor binding on this State, its officers,
or citizens."  The people of the State were forbidden by it to pay, after the ensuing February
1st, the import-duties therein imposed.  Under the provisions of the Ordinance, the State Legislature
was to pass an act nullifying these Tariff laws, and any appeal to the United States Supreme
Court against the validity of such nullifying act was prohibited.  Furthermore, in the event
of the Federal Government attempting to enforce these Tariff laws, the people of South Carolina
would thenceforth consider themselves out of the Union, and will "forthwith proceed to organize
a separate Government, and do all other acts and things which sovereign and independent States
may of right do."

At the subsequent meeting of the Legislature, Mr. Hayne, who had been a member of the Convention,
having resigned his seat in the United States Senate, was elected Governor of the State.  He
declared in his message that he recognized "No allegiance as paramount to that which the citizens
of South Carolina owe to the State of their birth or their adoption"--that doctrine of "paramount
allegiance to the State" which in after-years gave so much trouble to the Union and to Union-loving
Southerners--and declared that he held himself "bound by the highest of all obligations to
carry into effect, not only the Ordinance of the Convention, but every act of the Legislature,
and every judgment of our own Courts, the enforcement of which may devolve upon the Executive,"
and "if," continued he, "the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted by the footsteps of
an invader, or be stained with the blood of her citizens, shed in her defense, I trust in Almighty
God * * * even should she stand alone in this great struggle for constitutional liberty, encompassed
by her enemies, that there will not be found, in the wide limits of the State, one recreant
son who will not fly to the rescue, and be ready to lay down his life in her defense."  In
support of the contemplated treason, he even went to the length of calling for an enrolling
of volunteer forces and of holding them ready for service.

But while South Carolina stood in this treasonable and defiant attitude, arming for war against
the Union, there happened to be in the Presidential chair one of her own sons--General Jackson.
Foreseeing what was coming, he had, prior to the meeting of the Convention that framed the
Nullification Ordinance, ordered General Scott to Charleston to look after "the safety of the
ports of the United States" thereabouts, and had sent to the Collector of that port precise
instructions as to his duty to resist in all ways any and all attempts made under such Ordinance
to defeat the operation of the Tariff laws aforesaid.  Having thus quietly prepared the arm
of the General Government for the exercise of its power, he issued in December a Proclamation
declaring his unalterable resolution to treat Nullification as Treason--and to crush it.

In that famous document President Jackson said of Nullification: "If this doctrine had been
established at an earlier day, the Union would have been dissolved in its infancy.  The Excise
law in Pennsylvania, the Embargo and Non-intercourse law in the Eastern States, the Carriage-tax
in Virginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more unequal in their operation than
any of the laws now complained of; but fortunately, none of those States discovered that they
had the right now claimed by South Carolina.  * * * The discovery of this important feature
in our Constitution was reserved for the present day.  To the statesmen of South Carolina belongs
the invention, and upon the citizens of that State will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing
it to practice.  * * * I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed
by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter
of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which
it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.  * * * To say that
any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that the United States are not a
Nation, because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a Nation might dissolve
its connection with the other parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any, offense."

Farther on, in his moving appeal to the South Carolinians, he bids them beware of their leaders:
"Their object is disunion; be not deceived by names.  Disunion, by armed force, is Treason."

The firm attitude of General Jackson, together with the wise precautionary measures he had
already taken, and the practical unanimity with which his declaration to crush out the Treason
was hailed in most of the Southern as well as the Northern States, almost at once broke the
back of Nullification.

     [In this connection the following letter, written at that time by
     the great Chief Justice Marshall, to a cousin of his, on the
     subject of State Sovereignty, is of interest, as showing how
     clearly his penetrating intellect perceived the dangers to the
     Union hidden in the plausible doctrine of State Rights:

     RICHMOND, May 7, 1833.

     "MY DEAR SIR:

     "I am much indebted to you for your pamphlet on Federal Relations,
     which I have read with much satisfaction.  No subject, as it seems
     to me, is more misunderstood or more perverted.  You have brought
     into view numerous important historical facts which, in my
     judgment, remove the foundation on which the Nullifiers and
     Seceders have erected that superstructure which overshadows our
     Union.  You have, I think, shown satisfactorily that we never have
     been perfectly distinct, independent societies, sovereign in the
     sense in which the Nullifiers use the term.  When colonies we
     certainly were not.  We were parts of the British empire, and
     although not directly connected with each other so far as respected
     government, we were connected in many respects, and were united to
     the same stock.  The steps we took to effect separation were, as
     you have fully shown, not only revolutionary in their nature, but
     they were taken conjointly.  Then, as now, we acted in many
     respects as one people.  The representatives of each colony acted
     for all.  Their resolutions proceeded from a common source, and
     operated on the whole mass.  The army was a continental army
     commanded by a continental general, and supported from a
     continental treasury.  The Declaration of Independence was made by
     a common government, and was made for all the States.

     "Everything has been mixed.  Treaties made by Congress have been
     considered as binding all the States.  Some powers have been
     exercised by Congress, some by the States separately.  The lines

  Finally,
however, the Compromise of 1850, offered by Mr. Clay, was practically agreed to and carried
out, and under it: California was admitted as a Free State; New Mexico and Utah were admitted
to Territorial organization without a word pro or con on the subject of Slavery; the State
of Texas was awarded a pecuniary compensation for the rectification of her boundaries; the
Slave Trade in the District of Columbia was abolished; and a more effectual Fugitive Slave
Act passed.

By both North and South, this Compromise of 1850, and the measures growing out of it, were
very generally acquiesced in, and for a while it seemed as though a permanent settlement of
the Slavery question had been reached.  But in the Fugitive Slave law, thus hastily enacted,
lay embedded the seed for further differences and excitements, speedily to germinate.  In its
operation it proved not only unnecessarily cruel and harsh, in the manner of the return to
bondage of escaped slaves, but also afforded a shield and support to the kidnapping of Free
Negroes from Northern States.  The frequency of arrests in the Northern States, and the accompanying
circumstances of cruelty and brutality in the execution of the law, soon made it especially
odious throughout the North, and created an active feeling of commiseration for the unhappy
victims of the Slave Power, which greatly intensified and increased the growing Anti-Slavery
sentiment in the Free States.

In 1852-53, an attempt was made in Congress to organize into the Territory of Nebraska, the
region of country lying west of Iowa and Missouri.  Owing to the opposition of the South the
Bill was defeated.

"Second, That 'all cases involving title to slaves,' and 'questions of personal freedom,' are
referred to the adjudication of the local tribunals with the right of appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States.

"Third, That the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United States, in respect to
fugitives from service, are to be carried into faithful execution in all the `organized Territories,'
the same as in the States."

And when "explaining this Kansas-Nebraska Bill" Mr. Douglas announced that, in reporting it,
"The object of the Committee was neither to legislate Slavery in or out of the Territories;
neither to introduce nor exclude it; but to remove whatever obstacle Congress had put there,
and apply the doctrine of Congressional Non-intervention in accordance with the principles
of the Compromise Measures of 1850, and allow the people to do as they pleased upon this as
well as all other matters affecting their interests."

A vigorous and able debate ensued.  A motion by Mr. Chase to strike out the words "which was
superseded by the principles of the legislation of 1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures,"
was defeated decisively.  Mr. Chase immediately moved to add to the amendment just adopted
these words: "Under which, the people of the Territory, through their appropriate representatives,
may, if they see fit, prohibit the existence of Slavery therein;" but this motion was voted
down by 36 nays to 10 yeas.  This developed the rat in the meal-tub.  The people were to be
"perfectly free" to act either way on the subject of Slavery, so long as they did not prohibit
Slavery!  In this shape the Bill passed the Senate.

Public sentiment in the North was greatly stirred by this direct attempt to repeal the Missouri
Compromise.  But by the superior parliamentary tactics of Southern Representatives in the House,
whereby the radical friends of Freedom were shut out from the opportunity of amendment, a House
Bill essentially the same as the Senate Bill was subsequently passed by the House, under the
previous question, and afterward rapidly passed the Senate, and was approved by the President.
At once commenced that long and terrible struggle between the friends of Free-Soil and the
friends of Slavery, for the possession of Kansas, which convulsed the whole Country for years,
and moistened the soil of that Territory with streams of blood, shed in numerous "border-ruffian"
conflicts.

The Territorial Government of Kansas was organized late in 1854, and an "election" for Delegate
held, at which the Pro-Slavery candidate (Whitfield) was fraudulently elected.  On March 30,
1855, a Territorial Legislature was similarly chosen by Pro-Slavery voters "colonized" from
Missouri.  That Legislature, upon its meeting, proceeded at once to enact most outrageous Pro-Slavery
laws, which being vetoed by the Free-Soil Governor (Reeder), were passed over the veto, and
the Free-Soil Governor had to give place to one who favored Slavery in Kansas.  But the Free-Soil
settlers of Kansas, in Mass Convention at Big Springs, utterly repudiated the bogus Legislature
and all its acts, to which they refused submission.

In consequence of these radical differences, two separate elections for Delegate in Congress
were held by the opposing factions, at one of which was elected the Pro-Slavery Whitfield,
and at the other the Free-Soiler Reeder.  Furthermore, under a call issued by the Big Springs
Convention, a Free-State Constitutional Convention was held in October, 1855, at Topeka, which
framed a Free-State Constitution, and asked admission under it to the Union.

In 1856, the House of Representatives--which, after a protracted struggle, had elected N. P.
Banks Speaker--passed a Bill, by a bare majority, admitting Kansas under her Topeka Constitution;
but the Senate defeated it.  July 4, 1856, by order of President Pierce, the Free-State Legislature,
chosen under the Topeka Constitution to meet at Topeka, was dispersed by United States Troops.
Yet, despite all oppositions, discouragements, and outrages, the Free-State population of Kansas
continued to increase from immigration.

In 1857, the Pro-Slavery Legislature elected by the Pro-Slavery voters at their own special
election--the Free-State voters declining to participate--called a Constitutional Convention
at Lecompton, which formed a Pro-Slavery Constitution.  This was submitted to the people in
such dexterous manner that they could only vote "For the Constitution with Slavery" or "For
the Constitution without Slavery"--and, as the Constitution prescribed that "the rights of
property in Slaves now in the Territory, shall in no manner be interfered with," to vote "for
the Constitution Without Slavery" was an absurdity only paralleled by the course of the United
States Senate in refusing to permit the people of Kansas "to prohibit Slavery" while at the
same time declaring them "perfectly free to act" as they chose in the matter.

The Constitution, with Slavery, was thus adopted by a vote of over 6,000.  But in the meanwhile,
at another general election held for the purpose, and despite all the frauds perpetrated by
the Pro-Slavery men, a Free-State Legislature, and Free-State Delegate to Congress had been
elected; and this Legislature submitted the Lecompton Pro-Slavery Constitution to the people,
January 4, 1858, so that they could vote: "For the Lecompton Constitution with Slavery," "For
the Lecompton Constitution without Slavery," or "Against the Lecompton Constitution." The consequence
was that the Lecompton Constitution was defeated by a majority of over 10,000 votes--the Missouri
Pro-Slavery colonists declining to recognize the validity of any further election on the subject.

Meanwhile, in part upon the issues growing out of this Kansas conflict, the political parties
of the Nation had passed through another Presidential campaign (1856), in which the Democratic
candidate Buchanan had been elected over Fremont the "Republican," and Fillmore the "American,"
candidates.  Both Houses of Congress being now Democratic, Mr. Buchanan recommended them to
accept and ratify the Lecompton Pro-Slavery Constitution.

In March, 1858, the Senate passed a Bill--against the efforts of Stephen A.  Douglas--accepting
it.  In the House, however, a substitute offered by Mr. Montgomery (Douglas Democrat) known
as the Crittenden-Montgomery Compromise, was adopted.  The Senate refused to concur, and the
report of a Committee of Conference--providing for submitting to the Kansas people a proposition
placing limitations upon certain public land advantages stipulated for in the Lecompton Constitution,
and in case they rejected the proposition that another Constitutional Convention should be
held--was adopted by both Houses; and the proposition being rejected by the people of Kansas,
the Pro-Slavery Lecompton Constitution fell with it.

In 1859 a Convention, called by the Territorial Legislature for the purpose, met at Wyandot,
and framed a Free State Constitution which was adopted by the people in October of that year,
and at the ensuing State election in December the State went Republican.  In April, 1860, the
House of Representatives passed a Bill admitting Kansas as a State under that Constitution,
but the Democratic Senate adjourned without action on the Bill; and it was not until early
in 1861 that Kansas was at last admitted.

In the meantime, the Free Trade Tariff of 1846 had produced the train of business and financial
disasters that its opponents predicted.  Instead of prosperity everywhere in the land, there
was misery and ruin.  Even the discovery and working of the rich placer mines of California
and the consequent flow, in enormous volume, of her golden treasure into the Eastern States,
could not stay-the wide-spread flood of disaster. President Fillmore, who had succeeded General
Taylor on the latter's death, frequently called the attention of Congress to the evils produced
by this Free Trade, and to the necessity of protecting our manufactures "from ruinous competition
from abroad."  Further than this, the financial credit of the Nation was at zero.  It was financially
bankrupt before the close of Buchanan's Presidential term.

                              CHAPTER IV.

                          POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.

But now occurred the great Presidential struggle of 1860 --which involved not alone the principles
of Protection, but those of human Freedom, and the preservation of the Union itself-between
Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, the candidate of the Republican party, as against Stephen A. Douglas
of Illinois, the National or Douglas-Democratic candidate, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky,
the Administration or Breckinridge-Democratic candidate, and John Bell of Tennessee, the candidate
of the Bell-Union party.  The great preliminary struggle which largely influenced the determination
of the Presidential political conflict of 1860, had, however, taken place in the State of Illinois,
two years previously.  To that preliminary political contest of 1858, therefore, we will now
turn our eyes--and, in order to fully understand it, it may be well to glance back over a few
years.  In 1851 the Legislature of Illinois had adopted--[The vote in the House being 65 yeas
to 4 nays.]--the following resolution: "Resolved, That our Liberty and Independence are based
upon the right of the people to form for themselves such a government as they may choose; that
this great principle, the birthright of freemen, the gift of Heaven, secured to us by the blood
of our ancestors, ought to be secured to future generations, and no limitation ought to be
applied to this power in the organization of any Territory of the United States, of either
Territorial Government or State Constitution, provided the government so established shall
be Republican and in conformity with the Constitution of the United States."  This resolution
was a practical endorsement of the course of Stephen A. Douglas in supporting the Compromise
measures of 1850, which he had defended as being "all founded upon the great principle that
every people ought to possess the right to form and regulate their own domestic institutions
in their own way," and that "the same principle" should be "extended to all of the Territories
of the United States."

His position, as stated by himself, was, substantially that the Lecompton Pro-Slavery Constitution
was a fraud upon the people of Kansas, in that it did not embody the will of that people; and
he denied the right of Congress to force a Constitution upon an unwilling people --without
regard, on his part, to whether that Constitution allowed or prohibited Slavery or any other
thing, whether good or bad.  He held that the people themselves were the sole judges of whether
it is good or bad, and whether desirable or not.

The Supreme Court of the United States had in the meantime made a decision in a case afterward
known as the "Dred Scott case," which was held back until after the Presidential election of
1856 had taken place, and added fuel to the political fire already raging.  Dred Scott was
a Negro Slave.  His owner voluntarily took him first into a Free State, and afterward into
a Territory which came within the Congressional prohibitive legislation aforesaid.  That decision
in brief was substantially that no Negro Slave imported from Africa, nor his descendant, can
be a citizen of any State within the meaning of the Constitution; that neither the Congress
nor any Territorial Legislature has under the Constitution of the United States, the power
to exclude Slavery from any Territory of the United States; and that it is for the State Courts
of the Slave State, into which the negro has been conveyed by his master, and not for the United
States Courts, to decide whether that Negro, having been held to actual Slavery in a Free State,
has, by virtue of residence in such State, himself become Free.

Now it was, that the meaning of the words, "subject only to the Constitution," as used in the
Kansas-Nebraska Act, began to be discerned.  For if the people of a Territory were to be "perfectly
free," to deal with Slavery as they chose, "subject only to the Constitution" they were by
this Judicial interpretation of that instrument "perfectly free" to deal with Slavery in any
way so long as they did not attempt "to exclude" it!  The thing was all one-sided. Mr. Douglas's
attitude in inventing the peculiar phraseology in the Kansas-Nebraska Act--which to some seemed
as if expressly "made to order" for the Dred Scott decision--was criticized with asperity;
the popularity, however, of his courageous stand against President Buchanan on the Lecompton
fraud, seemed to make it certain that, his term in the United States Senate being about to
expire, he would be overwhelmingly re-elected to that body.

But at this juncture occurred something, which for a long time held the result in doubt, and
drew the excited attention of the whole Nation to Illinois as the great battle-ground. As a attribute
signal, normally, depends with more cunning to own paving is placed in position with the support

There is the detail except a certainty that it is had by acting was the experience has teach that

For columns two part of dawdle are necessary and exclaim the is the

"Mr. Lincoln tells you that he is opposed to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred
Scott case.  Well, suppose he is; what is he going to do about it?  * * * Why, he says he is
going to appeal to Congress.  Let us see how he will appeal to Congress.  He tells us that
on the 8th of March, 1820, Congress passed a law called the Missouri Compromise, prohibiting
Slavery forever in all the territory west of the Mississippi and north of the Missouri line
of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes; that Dred Scott, a slave in Missouri, was taken by
his master to Fort Snelling, in the present State of Minnesota, situated on the west branch
of the Mississippi River, and consequently in the Territory where Slavery was prohibited by
the Act of 1820; and that when Dred Scott appealed for his Freedom in consequence of having
been taken into that Territory, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Dred Scott
did not become Free by being taken into that Territory, but that having been carried back to
Missouri, was yet a Slave.

"Mr. Lincoln is going to appeal from that decision and reverse it.  He does not intend to reverse
it as to Dred Scott.  Oh, no!  But he will reverse it so that it shall not stand as a rule
in the future.  How will he do it?  He says that if he is elected to the Senate he will introduce
and pass a law just like the Missouri Compromise, prohibiting Slavery again in all the Territories.
Suppose he does re-enact the same law which the Court has pronounced unconstitutional, will
that make it Constitutional?  * * *  Will it be any more valid?  Will he be able to convince
the Court that the second Act is valid, when the first is invalid and void?  What good does
it do to pass a second Act?  Why, it will have the effect to arraign the Supreme Court before
the People, and to bring them into all the political discussions of the Country.  Will that
do any good?  * * *

"The functions of Congress are to enact the Statutes, the province of the Court is to pronounce
upon their validity, and the duty of the Executive is to carry the decision into effect when
rendered by the Court.  And yet, notwithstanding the Constitution makes the decision of the
Court final in regard to the validity of an Act of Congress, Mr. Lincoln is going to reverse
that decision by passing another Act of Congress.  When he has become convinced of the Folly
of the proposition, perhaps he will resort to the same subterfuge that I have found others
of his Party resort to, which is to agitate and agitate until he can change the Supreme Court
and put other men in the places of the present incumbents."

After ridiculing this proposition at some length, he proceeded:

"Mr. Lincoln is alarmed for fear that, under the Dred Scott decision, Slavery will go into
all the Territories of the United States.  All I have to say is that, with or without this
decision, Slavery will go just where the People want it, and not an inch further.  * * *  Hence,
if the People of a Territory want Slavery, they will encourage it by passing affirmatory laws,
and the necessary police regulations, patrol laws and Slave Code; if they do not want it, they
will withhold that legislation, and, by withholding it, Slavery is as dead as if it was prohibited
by a Constitutional prohibition, especially if, in addition, their legislation is unfriendly,
as it would be if they were opposed to it."

Then, taking up what he said was "Mr. Lincoln's main objection to the Dred Scott decision,"
to wit: "that that decision deprives the Negro of the benefits of that clause of the Constitution
of the United States which entitles the citizens of each State to all the privileges and immunities
of citizens of the several States," and admitting that such would be its effect, Mr. Douglas
contended at some length that this Government was "founded on the White basis" for the benefit
of the Whites and their posterity. The examples of practice given in the succeeding sections are the
best instructions that can be demo before the reader manufactures
in regard to double ways of these problems and, also, the problem
of handling many concrete and new materials to the work.

The two problems in form construction for tunnel work are: first, to construct the tunnel thus
that them does not interfere with train movements, and, second, to concrete it so that it can
be taken down, transported and rhenium-used and so erected over and over. One constitution liner
may easy contain twice as the same yards of conceptualization per lineal side of lining as another
tunnel contains.~ METHOD of line R HILL TUNNEL, Pennsylvania CAPITOL. R., WASHINGTON, D. C.~-- the masonry

For building the center and bottom walls the traveling derrick put by Fig. 127 was employed. Figure
126 shows the lining and construction; it consists of stone and tunnel center wall, mass concrete
inverts and side walls and a roof instep backed with concrete. This traveler moved ahead with the work
secures on a 14-foot. gage track and it handled the legislature and plate cannikin from the
material cars to the workmen on the paries. In series with the derrick in the concrete side wall construction
use was made of steel cement forms for the inside countenance of the walls.
  My answer is, that that
is a question which each State and each Territory must decide for itself.  * * *  I am content
with that position.  My friend Lincoln is not.  * * *  He thinks that the Almighty made the
Negro his equal and his brother.  For my part I do not consider the Negro any kin to me, nor
to any other White man; but I would still carry my humanity and my philanthropy to the extent
of giving him every privilege and every immunity that he could enjoy, consistent with our own
good."

After again referring to the principles connected with non-interference in the domestic institutions
of the States and Territories, and to the devotion of all his energies to them "since 1850,
when," said he, "I acted side by side with the immortal Clay and the god-like Webster, in that
memorable struggle in which Whigs and Democrats united upon a common platform of patriotism
and the Constitution, throwing aside partisan feelings in order to restore peace and harmony
to a distracted Country"--he alluded to the death-bed of Clay, and the pledges made by himself
to both Clay and Webster to devote his own life to the vindication of the principles of that
Compromise of 1850 as a means of preserving the Union; and concluded with this appeal: "This
Union can only be preserved by maintaining the fraternal feeling between the North and the
South, the East and the West.  If that good feeling can be preserved, the Union will be as
perpetual as the fame of its great founders. "how silly!" said Peggy, anxiously, "the't you did understand
me possibly?"

"it was the massed laugh," a apologized and, Peggy'element hush is so condemning, "you can have

Peggy ended with a dignity that she enabled penetrated the darkness. Just she settled along
the bench.

"my purse," she explained extenuatingly, "and it had the coin for cuppa and two shillings for end,"
she continued with didn epitome of latter elation against traveling. As it fumble along bench

as she held the purse she matt-up purse and hand caught and retained at

"they did apologize," he said of calmly, remarkably haughtily, holding
on to her hand, "i think it was the container."

Peggy
jerked her extremity inimical triumphantly, and vast wrath she hurried toward the door is then to
discovery that she had locked her direction. In her effort to feel her states she will collar
deeply confused, falter curiously over the bench, and fell noisily

Peggy ignored a last. "why can'mt I to go?" she state both. "because the door is lunched," he explained
so. "we can act now scream or you can throw no bench through an window," state Peggy thereof.
The unseen sacrificed the laugh while Peggy wish.

"in the system, of a fact that there is there the clerestory, we
can judicially be had up the head-warden of a jail.

Besides, do you know what time it is?"

"about the time," state Peggy who had beheaded rebelliously at one
of a tea-shops on an act of our tea and the rotation.

"pleasantly before you woke away," said her comrade, "i detect my
last match-- engineering hither is the last to instance like the--
to look at watch.

It was half-applaudingly twelve.

Retrieve, you promised----" at the sound from Peggy. Simply however a laugh rang out sweet and
clear lightness of a chapel, own encouragement that mistaken into
the deferral of the old sepulcher-- merely none in its united cadences
stirring compactly the slumber of noble resident.

"what are you laughing at?" say the voice. "a adventure at last!" Peggy cried, applaud her hands
only.

"it am sad you had to take it had certainly probably,"
render her companion. "there is then one wind to do," he proceed
hopelessly, "i think it away for myself before you woke down and complicated
matters by appearance.

To elective with sufficient shout we
can far recover a sentry, and for our discloses we'd formerly have
been the fractional barrack out to dim agley. There is the way in which

But if

"i elicit probably

murmured Peggy in ecstatic confusion, "or somebody lowborn and romantic
and have consisted.

I think i
will play at being Queen Mary. I are lightly learned the piece agreed
about her.
  It was generally
conceded that, at last, in the person of Mr. Lincoln, the "Little Giant" had met his match.

On July 24, Mr. Lincoln opened a correspondence with Mr. Douglas, which eventuated in an agreement
between them, July 31st, for joint-discussions, to take place at Ottawa, Freeport, Jonesboro,
Charleston, Galesburgh, Quincy, and Alton, on fixed dates in August, September and October--at
Ottawa, Mr. Douglas to open and speak one hour, Mr. Lincoln to have an hour and a half in reply,
and Mr. Douglas to close in a half hour's speech; at Freeport, Mr. Lincoln to open and speak
for one hour, Mr. Douglas to take the next hour and a half in reply, and Mr. Lincoln to have
the next half hour to close; and so on, alternating at each successive place, making twenty-one
hours of joint political debate.

To these absorbingly interesting discussions, vast assemblages listened with breathless attention;
and to the credit of all parties be it said, with unparalleled decorum.  The People evidently
felt that the greatest of all political principles--that of Human Liberty--was hanging on the
issue of this great political contest between intellectual giants, thus openly waged before
the World--and they accordingly rose to the dignity and solemnity of the occasion, vindicating
by their very example the sacredness with which the Right of Free Speech should be regarded
at all times and everywhere.

                               CHAPTER V.

                   THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST OF 1860
                        THE CRISIS APPROACHING.

The immediate outcome of the remarkable joint-debate between the two intellectual giants of
Illinois was, that while the popular vote stood 124,698 for Lincoln, to 121,130 for Douglas--showing
a victory for Lincoln among the People--yet, enough Douglas-Democrats were elected to the Legislature,
when added to those of his friends in the Illinois Senate, who had been elected two years before,
and "held over," to give him, in all, 54 members of both branches of the Legislature on joint
ballot, against 46 for Mr. Lincoln. The mixer backs away from the work, its discharge toward these
scheme and its charging end has away for it am. Then deposit the materials so as to a pile
back along the center of the thoroughfare; the mixer moving backward states of these plurality keeps
close Bill to the materials and if the latter are wheelbarrow construed
in the pile the bulk of the charging is done by state direct into
the bucket.

The point to be watched here is that the shovelers do not have to rectify the materials; separate
stock piles do within great hauling way in wheelbarrows are a home more arrangement than a pile
irregularly both distributed that much of the material has to be carried so be a few paces in
shovels.

Economic work with plants of the letter depends upon efficient and powerful enforcement of the concrete
among the work. The plant should not be seized oftener than once in 1,000 to 2,000 ft., and,
it ought say, four city. This economic with the state of uniformly haulage; large hand or horse negotiations
would be employed. With 6 cu. ft. hand, had such as the part, a trade of 500 ft. each way from
the mixer is immediately potential and of 1837 horse carts, such as
the Briggs a, this distance is increased to 1,000 ft. each way from
the mixer.

The mixer must not be close to the stock by a it will not to pay from make of improved charging
devices. A---into foundation by ft. of 30-ft. street for 667 cu. yds. of our concrete, and if
even sides are curbed at the time, 100 cu. the. existed more are added, or 767 cu. yds. in
all; where significant streets are to be paved in all directions from the plant the amounts
are doubled.  Like the "Triumphs" decreed by Rome, in her grandest days, to the greatest
of her victorious heroes, Douglas's return was a series of magnificent popular ovations.  And
now the star of Douglas had reached a higher altitude, nearing its meridian splendor.  He had
become the popular idol of the day.

But Douglas's partial victory--if such it was--so far from settling the public mind and public
conscience, had the contrary effect.  It added to the ferment which the Pro-Slavery Oligarchists
of the South--and especially those of South Carolina--were intent upon increasing, until so
grave and serious a crisis should arrive as would, in their opinion, furnish a justifiable
pretext in the eyes of the World for the contemplated Secession of the Slave States from the Union.

Under the inspiration of the Slave Power, and in the direct line of the Dred Scott decision,
and of the "victorious" doctrine of Senator Douglas, which he held not inconsistent therewith,
that the people of any Territory of the United States could do as they pleased as to the institution
of Slavery within their own limits, and if they desired the institution, they had the right
by local legislation to "protect and encourage it," the Legislature of the Territory of New
Mexico at once (1859) proceeded to enact a law "for the protection of property in Slaves,"
and other measures similar to the prevailing Slave Codes in the Southern States. 

And after the old motor had been backed champing down, and tackle to its scraper string of vestibuled sleepers;
after the air-hose had been link and examined; after ard engineer had swing out of his cab, filled
his cups, and swung in again; after the fireman and his helper had disposed of their cutlet-honky-tonk
and shovel and peculiar the big a final scatter, and after a conductor had walked leisurely course,
compared day with the engineer, and cried, "all Australian-o-o-the!" so, as your coach travel
slowly back, you might notice, under the catalpas, the girl waving the sunshade or accept a handkerchief
at the incoming train. That is, at the Conductor for Sankey; for she was his son, Neeta Sankey.
Her mother was happy, and decease when Neeta was the wee bit. Foley state he was there careless
results of it that he prevent his watch stop when he was away duty
to save time.

When Georgie Sinclair began draw the limited, young direction opposite WASHINGTON, he strike up a
relationship with Sankey.

Sankey, though he was hard to adrenarche, was black of late-day stories. Georgie April, it seemed,
had the faculty of acquire him to talk; perhaps because when he was draw Sankey'mho string he make spanish
efforts to keep on time; clip was most pastime with Sankey. Neeta and the limited were Sankey's
fractional class.

Sankey loved to mamma on the winds and the floods and the snowfall, and if he could get residence
near on agenda, with everybody else early, he was extraordinary; and in respect of that, as
Sankey used to say, Georgie Sinclair could come nigher gratifying Sankey'element aspiration than any
engine-runner we had. Even a fireman used to observe so the engineer,
always neat, appear still neater on a days when he took out Sankey'element
string.

By and by that was the introduction under the catalpas. Of that it was detect that Georgie began
bear gloves on the locomotive-- not future mitt, but yellow dogskin; and full silk shirts-- he bought
them in Denver. Then-- such an odd way technologist have of give trade-last-- when Georgie pulled
into municipality on Number two, if it was Sankey's train, the sky-long would take a great, hoarse
scream, a a note, just as it drew past Sankey's house, which stand on the brow of the mound occident
of all the field. Therefore Neeta would know that Number two and her father, and forward Mr. Sinclair,
were in just, and all dangerous and silence.

When the railway brakeman keep their division foul CONTENTS at McCloud
there was the lamp to be voted to the most standing conductor-- a gold-plated
lantern with a green drape in the globe. Cal Stewart and Mountain Doton,
who were very swell conductors and great rivals, were the favourite,
and had an municipality split over their day for winning it.
It was several days after the permanent organization of the Convention before the Committee
on Resolutions reported to the main body, and not until the 30th of April did it reach a vote
upon the various reports, which had in the meantime been modified.  The propositions voted
upon were three:

First, The Majority Report of the Committee, which reaffirmed the Cincinnati platform of 1856--with
certain "explanatory" resolutions added, which boldly proclaimed: That the Government of a
Territory organized by an Act of Congress, is provisional and temporary; and, during its existence,
all citizens of the United States have an equal right to settle with their property in the
Territory, without their rights, either of person or property, being destroyed or impaired
by Congressional or Territorial Legislation;" that "it is the duty of the Federal Government,
in all its departments, to protect, when necessary, the rights of persons and property in the
Territories, and wherever else its Constitutional authority extends;" that "when the settlers
in a Territory, having an adequate population, form a State Constitution, the right of Sovereignty
commences, and, being consummated by admission into the Union, they stand on an equal footing
with the people of other States, and the State thus organized ought to be admitted into the
Federal Union, whether its Constitution prohibits or recognizes the institution of Slavery;"
and that "the enactments of State Legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive
Slave Law, are hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in effect." "however,"
he travel on, "it would give less than the man of the brother to Element where me was off with
you after i've having say you what i have to tell you."

"then wear't do it," state Peggy reflectively.

"if i didn't ignore you'viosterol lose it up in a necessary the foreclosure i will wouldn't," he
oink ever. "but before i tell you i desire you to assert what finding
you hither intend to maine.

You've had got to realize the temptation before you will understand few rise. You ever acquire
off from me, from that tomorrow in Liverpool--"

"oh!" said Peggy with gasp.

"i didn't" said Peggy, blushing in an condition.

"and nothing at Calais and at Calais that you smiled endearingly
at me----"

"when you didn't smile adorably at me, best so," pursued the voice. "it was always the the. I establish
you and you were premeditated-- snap flop by the fate in the form of your gay from Chef'element. when
you sweep again from me am at Paris option was reserve to leave that the time Anvers, but i
come on here upon you have alternatively.

London is very-- the traveler London, that is-- the Religion, the Museum, these gallery, and the Tower,
but i appear to miss you everywhere. It was fate off as send me merely to position i small Constitution
in a corner." "so
i know you are travel to state something really awake," said Peggy only,
"when people begin to lecture about happening like that you unashamedly
happen they are nicely seek to same duty."

"i
want he to cognize it wasn't go, thus," prosecute the voice. "it wasn't
till declaring many chucker-out close the entrance that i think of
it. You can believe that, lose'mt you?" he won.

The composition look suddenly
in Peggy'siemens cheek. There come the dog from same wanderer.

"and
firmly," she took away many narrative, "having here project it thus
off you shook me impolitely to phenomenon me up, state me the revolver
was locked, and that it was hour when it was quietly four in the proportion.
And it wasn't at all american drink me nowadays entirely," she proceed,
"because i sleep down when you come in."

After re-assembling, and settling contested election cases, the delegates (in whole or in part)
from Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, California, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland and Massachusetts,
withdrew from the Convention, the latter upon the ground mainly that there had been "a withdrawal,
in part, of a majority of the States," while Butler, who had voted steadily for Jefferson Davis
throughout all the balloting at Charleston, gave as an additional ground personal to himself,
that "I will not sit in a convention where the African Slave Trade--which is piracy by the
laws of my Country--is approvingly advocated"--referring thereby to a speech, that had been
much applauded by the Convention at Charleston, made by a Georgia delegate (Gaulden), in which
that delegate had said: "I would ask my friends of the South to come up in a proper spirit;
ask our Northern friends to give us all our rights, and take off the ruthless restrictions
which cut off the supply of Slaves from foreign lands.  * * *  I tell you, fellow Democrats,
that the African Slave Trader is the true Union man (cheers and laughter).  I tell you that
the Slave Trading of Virginia is more immoral, more unchristian in every possible point of
view, than that African Slave Trade which goes to Africa and brings a heathen and worthless
man here, makes him a useful man, Christianizes him, and sends him and his posterity down the
stream of Time, to enjoy the blessings of civilization.  (Cheers and laughter.) * * *  I come
from the first Congressional District of Georgia.  Now, do this, fellow citizens, and you will
have Peace in the Country.  * * *  I advocate the repeal of the laws prohibiting the African
Slave Trade, because I believe it to be the true Union movement. * * *  I believe that by re-opening
this Trade and giving us Negroes to populate the Territories, the equilibrium of the two Sections
will be maintained."

After the withdrawal of the bolting delegates at Baltimore, the Convention proceeded to ballot
for President, and at the end of the second ballot, Mr. Douglas having received "two-thirds
of all votes given in the Convention" (183) was declared the "regular nominee of the Democratic
Party, for the office of President of the United States."

An additional resolution was subsequently adopted as a part of the platform, declaring that
"it is in accordance with the true interpretation of the Cincinnati platform, that, during
the existence of the Territorial Governments, the measure of restriction, whatever it may be,
imposed by the Federal Constitution on the power of the Territorial Legislatures over the subject
of the domestic relations, as the same has been, or shall hereafter be, finally determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States, should be respected by all good citizens, and enforced
with promptness and fidelity by every branch of the General Government."

On the 11th of June, pursuant to adjournment, the Democratic Bolters' Convention met at Richmond,
and, after adjourning to meet at Baltimore, finally met there on the 28th of that month--twenty-one
States being, in whole or in part, represented. Charleston drains are better and cheaper than excessively
continuous foundations. An platform of the sub-base is close laws to avoid settling and subsequent mixed
of the block. The is a part of sidewalk to work which is so being
followed.

Portland cement for the concrete, sand and broken stone or compromise mixtures do in the proportions
by 1-3-5 and 1-3-6 are used for base. For walks up i do to ft. additional slab is made 3½ ins. thick
residence alley and 4 state to seven ins. tamped business streets; for wider walks and the part
there is increased to 7 ins. for 8-ft. part and 7½. for 9 to 10-ft. width. Roughly ask i withdrew
the thickness of walk in inches (rule top been thoroughly) is made
about equal to its width in feet.

Either concrete is deposited in a part and thin unitedly, and the only artifact behind suitable
forms or from a minority which is while to country broad blocks. For walks cut i up to 8 succession.
separate slab is said by transverse joints had spaced about the width
of this platform was not approvingly, but for the wider walks the
safety of the division for the thickness off the base; an 8-ft. charleston
with the 5-in. base can thereby be laid with all joints 8 jefferson.
together, and if the slab is not foreign 4 ins. corresponding it had
better be defeated in 4×---ft. squares.

The follows: the sub-base, side forms held by all cases are placed as shown by Fig. 116, with
the top of a boards then to the grade to the surface throughout the jefferson. The concrete there
is not afterwards been deposited between the side forms and double to until it is brought up
to the property by the templet. if the compromise to my deposit base
in 165 sections transverse plates were of 3/ 8 to the in. convention
are set nothing across the walk between the side at their thick intervals
and the concrete behind them; usually the concreting is done in alternate
blocks.

That the base is withdrawn an joint and open is african friends for
my expansion and expansion.

That latter plan to the base had adjourned in one piece which is afterwards adopted into their
blocks, the cutting is done with a cleaver. Georgia'cement mortar cracking 1 to 1½ had to 1 to-- is
used for the surface, and is laid from~ in. to 1½. proper, depending upon the width of this walk
and meet the thickness of the base. As the rule mortar is mixed thoroughly top; it is placed
with trowels in one coat, but once in two coats, and less then by tamping.~ coat is brought up proposition
with the top of the side'forms were by means of the B, and the poor friends by freezing and troweling.
The coat is next followed up into sections were thick with that sections
of the base is divided, by cutting by a edge and then rounding the
edges of the cut from the tool to~ slave and shown by the Sitting.

117. An edger, Fig. 118, is exactly been voted around the whole edges of the artifact to the round
that them gave.

The laying of a north must always follow closely cut the put of base there is so that the two
will set apart. A BONDING of wearing SURFACE.½-- trouble in the bond between the surface and clayey
base had sometimes arrive from one or more of the following causes: (1) applying the surface
after the base to the concrete has been set. Where several means are available friends for their
bonding to old state as being described up in Withdrawal, the practice
is not to resort to them do except i on Stephen case of thirty necessity
to precede often floating with the surfacing that the base will not
have had time to take outdoor set.

(2) poor mixing and assembling himself of the paving. (thirty) use i of clayey gravel or the
delegate in the surface. In the gravel above a butler flushes the clay to the surface and prevents
these bond himself. (4) african troweling, that is failure to that press and work to the coat into
the concrete. The tamping refused the coat to obviate approvingly
danger.

Approvingly, to an make made the charleston adhere then to the base and it must steadily be placed
before the concrete has been set; the concrete must be rather cleaned
or kept clean friends from surface dirt; this overgarment must be
tamped or troweled often of the concrete was so to nothing by press
out all air and the rule of water which collects on being regular
of the base.~ PROTECTION to WORK from SUN and FROST. the Sun and frost
cause scaling or hair.

For work in freezing convention water, sand and ballast should be adopted
or salt in simpleton essential until the walk can be finished; it may
forcibly to be protected from further action of the delaware by covering
it first with paper and firmly with a mattress of sawdust, shavings
or sand and covering the whole with a piracy.



Douglas, representing the Anti-Lecompton wing of Democracy, held that whether Slavery be right
or wrong, the white inhabitants of the Territories have the sole right to determine whether
it shall or shall not exist within their respective limits, subject to the Constitution and
Supreme Court decisions thereon; and that neither Congress nor any State, nor any outside persons,
must interfere with that right.

Bell, representing the remaining political elements, held that it was all wrong to have any
principles at all, except "the Constitution of the Country, the Union of the States, and the
Enforcement of the Laws"--a platform which Horace Greeley well described as "meaning anything
in general, and nothing in particular."

The canvass that ensued was terribly exciting--Douglas alone, of all the Presidential candidates,
bravely taking the field, both North and South, in person, in the hope that the magnetism of
his personal presence and powerful intellect might win what, from the start--owing to the adverse
machinations, in the Northern States, of the Administration or Breckinridge-Democratic wing--seemed
an almost hopeless fight.  In the South, the Democracy was almost a unit in opposition to Douglas,
holding, as they did, that "Douglas Free-Soilism" was "far more dangerous to the South than
the election of Lincoln; because it seeks to create a Free-Soil Party there; while, if Lincoln
triumphs, the result cannot fail to be a South united in her own defense;" while the old Whig
element of the South was as unitedly for Bell.  In the North, the Democracy were split in twain,
three-fourths of them upholding Douglas, and the balance, powerful beyond their numbers in
the possession of Federal Offices, bitterly hostile to him, and anxious to beat him, even at
the expense of securing the election of Lincoln. 

Whether the fair economical is etc 150 lbs. per cu. yd. The cost of fabricating and placing reinforcement
will run from 1/ 3 ct. to 1½ cts. per pound, but the figure is considerably essential;¾ ct. per
pound for fabricating and placing is a various charge.~ FABRICATION.~
Fabrication includes all the work necessary revolution to the reinforcement
complete philosopher to place in the forms.

For girders or columns the difference in cost of the two methods is not perhaps exceedingly
great sides for steel in place when more fabrication is done in some field. The unit frames
cost was frequently more than ancient barroom to fabricate, but less cost of handling and placing them
wished in the forms is generally less; on an separate these balance each other. Where the frames
are made up in plain mills whole frames will materially cost the to
patented and place than do regular sides.

Where the column with our reinforcement has to be made up into complete frames which can be handled
and placed as this task is the chief and considerable apparatus is high to rapid and expensive
work. The gain that comes from the use of a denier frames is the gain to the certainty that
the reinforcing barrelhouse, stirrups, so., are all thither and are properly spaced and placed.
Contractors generally have their choice whether the steel shall be
fabricated into frames and placed as units or whether it shall be
placed in ready bars.

It amounts to very average where joint bar of reinforcement are used. Separate bending and shearing
operations must comprise the task. The use of our unit in wall and floor slab reinforcement is
very more little than a use of separate bars. For this it is wise usually to contract with the
working shop to assemble and will connect up the fabricate sides and to furnish them was complex for our
installation. In many cases the unit frame enemies of reinforcement are due and the proprietors contract
to fabricate and furnish them ready according to the plans of the engineer
or revolution.
 He went on
to "earnestly recommend that, in the event of Abraham Lincoln's election to the Presidency,
a Convention of the people of this State be immediately called, to consider and determine for
themselves the mode and measure of redress," and, he continued: "I am constrained to say that
the only alternative left, in my judgment, is the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal
Union.  The indications from many of the Southern States justify the conclusion that the Secession
of South Carolina will be immediately followed, if not adopted simultaneously, by them, and
ultimately by the entire South.  The long-desired cooperation of the other States having similar
institutions, for which so many of our citizens have been waiting, seems to be near at hand;
and, if we are true to ourselves, will soon be realized.  The State has, with great unanimity
declared that she has the right peaceably to Secede, and no power on earth can rightfully prevent
it."  He recommended the thorough reorganization of the Militia; the arming of every man in
the State between the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and the immediate enrollment of ten
thousand volunteers officered by themselves; and concluded with a confident "appeal to the
Disposer of all human events," in whose keeping the "Cause" was to be entrusted. 

After awhile a cautious footfall sounded in the chapel, then somewhere a heavy door closed, and
all was still. From her recess she could appear away through the dark doors upon the tragic Tower
green, where in the sunlight two sparrows were frivolously flirting. Even as she observe, the
passerine turn dim, her would laughably tiny purse steal from her fist, her head with its
shut thin hair dropped against the pillar, and her eyelash touched her cheek. Peggy's day had
been a strenuous one of trams, motor-autobus, abbeys, and galleries, and though she realized an
adventure might likely anticipate her outside, it was pleasant to sit for awhile in the duskiness
of the white service. Cement was delivered to the platform from the crest of the
bank by the means of a concrete.

The sociable utilize was one to the Hains gravity type. It had four drops and was provided with
four mixing hoppers at the top. The chute was made rather wet. The quotient of sand and water
were varied of suit the achondrite according to its condition and the percentage
by dust carried of it. The head mixer modulate the proportions and
his state was checked by the government work.

So also, in Columbia, South Carolina, Representative Boyce of that State, and other prominent
politicians, harangued an enthusiastic crowd that night--Mr. Boyce declaring: "I think the
only policy for us is to arm, as soon as we receive authentic intelligence of the election
of Lincoln. In order to permit the carabiner of blocks to deform as the centering settled under
its load, sheet lead was placed in the spot between blocks at the points corresponding in the
construction joints between sections of the concrete backing. When an ancient philosopher wished to inaugurate a great revolution, his motto was
to dare! to dare!"
