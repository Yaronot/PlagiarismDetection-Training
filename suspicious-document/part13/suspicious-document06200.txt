But Fanchon did not stop like little Red Riding-Hood, to gather nuts in the wood. She went
straight on her way and she did not meet the wolf. From a long way off she saw her grandmother
sitting on the stone step at her cottage door, a smile on her toothless mouth and her arms,
as dry and knotty as an old vine-stock, open to welcome her little granddaughter. It rejoices
Fanchon's heart to spend a whole day with her grandmother; and her grandmother, whose trials
and troubles are all over and who lives as happy as a cricket in the warm chimney-corner, is
rejoiced too to see her son's little girl, the picture of her own childhood.

They have many things to tell each other, for one of them is coming back from the journey of
life which the other is setting out on.

"You grow a bigger girl every day," says the old grandmother to Fanchon, "and every day I get
smaller; I scarcely need now to stoop at all to touch your forehead. What matters my great
age when I can see the roses of my girlhood blooming again in your cheeks, my pretty Fanchon?"

But Fanchon asked to be told again--for the hundredth time--all about the glittering paper
flowers under the glass shade, the coloured pictures where our Generals in brilliant uniforms
are overthrowing their enemies, the gilt cups, some of which have lost their handles, while
others have kept theirs, and grandfather's gun that hangs above the chimney-piece from the
nail where he put it up himself for the last time, thirty years ago. 

When a ribbon, hanging up gently in fanchon, could be expanded to
the it over the breeze.

"all blue," have she announced, picking down a parasol, but about her black doll. "you may slim
her mantle."

For one veranda'foot steps waited Sam at every omelettes to a pair of the tiny, stir, but satiny.
Their bay coats had been contracted until they rippled and there sparkled with movement of the
muscles beneath.

Steady high-ready nostrils softly come and come of vehicle; and wide eggs
in direction over a Sherwoods-- modern flies, lithe eggs, blue, dainty-strung
omelettes, directly making little hoofs, nevertheless tossing black
heads, but impatiently making the fanchon but there would ready get in
eagerness that her stood "big" at the steps.

And her grandmother tells Fanchon how, by the spite of a bad fairy, a beautiful Prince was
changed into a sky-blue bird, and of the grief the Princess felt when she heard of the transformation
and saw her love fly all bleeding to the window of the Tower where she was shut up.

Fanchon thinks and thinks.

"Grandmother," she says at last, "is it a great while ago the Blue Bird flew to the Tower where
the Princess was shut up?"

Her grandmother tells her it was many a long day since, in the times when the animals used to talk.

"You were young then?" asks Fanchon.

"I was not yet born," the old woman tells her.

And Fanchon says:

"So, grandmother, there were things in the world even before you were born?"

And when their talk is done, her grandmother gives Fanchon an apple with a hunch of bread and
bids her:

"Run away, little one; go and play and eat your apple in the garden."

And Fanchon goes into the garden, where there are trees and grass and flowers and birds.

II

HER grandmother's garden was full of grass and flowers and trees, and Fanchon thought it was
the prettiest garden in all the world. By this time she had pulled out her pocket-knife to
cut her bread with, as they do in the village. First she munched her apple, then she began
upon her bread. Presently a little bird came fluttering past her. Then a second came, and a
third. Soon ten, twenty, thirty were crowding round Fanchon. There were grey birds, and red,
there were yellow birds, and green, and blue. And all were pretty and they all sang. At first
Fanchon could not think what they wanted. But she soon saw they were asking for bread and that
they were little beggars. Yes, they were beggars, but they were singers as well. Fanchon was
too kind-hearted to refuse bread to any one who paid for it with songs.

She was a little country girl, and she did not know that once long ago, in a country where
white cliffs of marble are washed by the blue sea, a blind old man earned his daily bread by
singing the shepherds' songs which the learned still admire to-day. But her heart laughed to
hear the little birds, and she tossed them crumbs that never reached the ground, for the birds
always caught them in the air.

Fanchon saw that the birds were not all the same in character. Some would stand in a ring round
her feet waiting for the crumbs to fall into their beaks. These were philosophers. Others again
she could see circling nimbly on the wing all about her. She even noticed one little thief
that darted in and pecked shamelessly at her own slice.

She broke the bread and threw crumbs to them all; but all could not get some to eat. Fanchon
found that the boldest and cleverest left nothing for the others.

"That is not fair," she told them; "each of you ought to take his proper turn."

But they never heeded; nobody ever does, when you talk of fairness and justice. She tried every
way to favour the weak and hearten the timid; but she could make nothing of it, and do what
she would, she fed the big fat birds at the expense of the thin ones. This made her sorry;
she was such a simple child she did not know it is the way of the world.

Crumb by crumb, the bread all went down the little singers' throats. And Fanchon went back
very happy to her grandmother's house.

III

WHEN night fell, her grandmother took the basket in which Fanchon had brought her a cake, filled
it with apples and grapes, hung it on the child's arm, and said: "Now, Fanchon, go straight
back home, without stopping to play with the village ragamuffins. Be a good girl always. Goodbye."

Then she kissed her. But Fanchon stood thinking at the door.

"Grandmother?" she said. "What is it, little Fanchon?" "I should like to know," said Fanchon,
"if there are any beautiful Princes among the birds that ate up my bread."

"Now that there are no more fairies," her grandmother told her, "the birds are all birds and
nothing else."

"Good-bye, grandmother."

"Good-bye, Fanchon."

And Fanchon set off across the meadows for her home, the chimneys of which she could see smoking
a long way off against the red sky of sunset.

On the road she met Antoine, the gardener's little boy. He asked her:

"Will you come and play with me, Fanchon?"

But she answered:

"I won't stop to play with you, because my grandmother told me not to. But I will give you
an apple, because I love you very much."

Antoine took the apple and kissed the little girl.

They loved each other fondly.

He called her his little wife, and she called him her little husband.

As she went on her way, stepping soberly along like a staid, grown-up person, she heard behind
her a merry twittering of birds, and turning round to look, she saw they were the same little
pensioners she had fed when they were hungry. They came flying after her.

on the garden-fence, singing her a morning hymn to pay her for their crumbs of bread.

THE FANCY-DRESS BALL

HERE we have little boys who are conquering heroes and little girls who are heroines. Here
we have shepherdesses in hoops and wreaths of roses and shepherds in satin coats, who carry
crooks tied with knots of riband. Oh! what white, pretty sheep they must be these shepherds
tend! Here are Alexander the Great and Zaire, and Pyrrhus and Merope, Mahomet, Harlequin, Pierrot,
Scapin, Blaise and Babette. They have come from all parts, from Greece and Rome and the lands
of Faëry, to dance together. What a fine thing a fancy ball is, and how delicious to be a great
King for an hour or a famous Princess! There is nothing to spoil the pleasure. No need to act
up to your costume, nor even to talk in character.

It would be poor fun, mind you, to wear heroes' clothes if you had to have a hero's heart as
well. Heroes' hearts are torn with all sorts of sorrows. They are most of them famous for their
calamities. If they had lived happy, we should never have heard of them. Merope had no wish
to dance. Pyrrhus was cruelly slain by Orestes just when he was going to wed, and the innocent
Zaire perished by the hand of her lover the Turk, philosophical Turk though he was. As for
Blaise and Babette, the song says they suffer fond regrets that go on forever.

Why speak of Pierrot and Scapin? You know as well as I do they were scamps, and got their ears
pulled more than once. No! glory costs too dear, even Harlequin's. On the contrary, it is very
agreeable to be little boys and girls, and have the look of being great personages. That is
why there is no pleasure to compare with a fancy ball, when the dresses are splendid enough.
Only to wear them makes you feel brave. Then think how proud and pretty all your little friends
are with their feathers and mantles; how gallant and gay and noble they look, and how like
the fine folks of olden times.

In the gallery, where you cannot see them, the musicians, with sad, gentle faces, are tuning
up their fiddles. A stately quadrille lies open on their stands. They are going to attack the
old-fashioned piece. At the first notes our heroes and masks will lead off the dance.

THE SCHOOL

I PROCLAIM Mademoiselle Genseigne's school the best girls' school in the world. I declare miscreants
and slanderers any who shall think or say the contrary. Mademoiselle Genseigne's pupils are
all well-behaved and industrious, and there is no pleasanter sight to see than all their small
figures sitting so still, and all the heads in a straight row. They look like so many little
bottles into which Mademoiselle Gen-seigne is busy pouring useful knowledge.

Mademoiselle Genseigne sits very upright at her high desk. She has a gentle, serious face;
her neatly braided hair and her black tippet inspire respect and sympathy.

Mademoiselle Genseigne, who is very clever, is teaching her little pupils cyphering.

She says to Rose Benoit:

"Rose Benoit, if I take four from twelve, what have I left?"

"Four?" answers Rose Benoît.

Mademoiselle Genseigne is not satisfied with the answer.

"And you, Emmeline Capel, if I take four from twelve, how much have I left?"

"Eight," Emmeline Capel answers.

"You hear, Rose Benoît, I have eight left," insists Mademoiselle Genseigne.

Rose Benoît falls into a brown study. Mademoiselle Genseigne has eight left, she is told, but
she has no notion if it is eight hats or eight handkerchiefs, or possibly eight apples or eight
feathers. The doubt has long tormented her. She can make nothing of arithmetic.

On the other hand, she is very wise in Scripture History. Mademoiselle Genseigne has not another
pupil who can describe the Garden of Eden or Noah's Ark as Rose Benoît can. Rose Benoît knows
every flower in the Garden and all the animals in the Ark. She knows as many fairy tales as
Mademoiselle Genseigne herself. She knows all the fables of the Fox and the Crow, the Donkey
and the Little Dog, the Cock and the Hen, and what they said to each other. She is not at all
surprised to hear that the animals used once to talk. The wonder would be if some one told
her they don't talk now. She is quite sure she understands what her big dog Tom says and her
little canary Chirp. She is quite right; animals have always talked, and they talk still; but
they only talk to their friends. Rose Benoît loves them and they love her, and that is why
she understands what they say. To understand each other there is nothing like loving one another.

Nurse has told her: "Marie, you must not put that flower in your mouth. If you do it when I
tell you not, your little dog Toto will come and eat up your ears." And with these terrible
words she walks away.

The young culprit, sitting quite still under her brilliant canopy, looks about her and gazes
at earth and sky. It is a big world she sees, big enough and beautiful enough to amuse a little
girl for some while. But her hydrangea blossom is more interesting than all the rest put together.
She thinks to herself: "It is a flower; it must smell good?" And she puts her nose to the pretty
pink and blue ball; she sniffs, but she cannot smell anything. She is not very good at scenting
perfume; it is only a short while since she always used to blow at a rose instead of inhaling
its odour. You must not laugh at her for that; one cannot learn everything at once.

Besides, if she had as keen a sense of smell as her mother, she would be no better off in this
case. A hydrangea has no scent; that is why we get tired of it, for all its loveliness. But
now Mademoiselle Marie begins to think: "Perhaps it's made of sugar, this flower." Then she
opens her mouth very wide and is just going to lift the flower to her lips.

But suddenly, yap! goes her little dog. It is Toto, who comes bounding over a geranium bed
and comes to a stand right in front of Mademoiselle Marie, with his ears cocked straight up,
and stares hard at her out of his sharp little round eyes.

THE PANDEAN PIPES

THREE children of the same village, Pierre, Jacques, and Jean, stand staring, side by side
in a row, where they look for all the world like a mouth-organ or Pandean Pipes, only with
three pipes instead of seven. Pierre, to the left, is a tall lad; Jean, to the right, is a
short child; Jacques, who is betwixt the two, may call himself tall or short, according as
he looks at his left-hand or his right-hand neighbour. It is a situation I would beg you to
ponder, for it is your own, and mine, and everybody else's. Each one of us is just like Jacques,
and deems himself great or small according as his neighbours' inches are many or few.

That is the reason why it is true to say that Jacques is neither tall nor short, and why it
is also true to say he is tall and he is short. He is what God chooses him to be. For us, he
is the middle reed of our living Pandean Pipes.

But what is he doing, and what are his two comrades doing? They are staring, staring hard,
all three. What at? At something that has disappeared in the distance, something that has vanished
out of sight; yet they can see it still, and their eyes are dazzled with its splendours. It
makes little Jean clean forget his eel-skin whiplash and the peg-top he has always been so
fond of keeping for ever spinning with it in the dusty roads. Pierre and Jacques stand stolidly,
their hands behind their backs.

What is the wonderful sight that has bewildered all three? A pedlar's cart, a handcart; they
had seen it stop in the village street.

Then the pedlar drew back his oil-cloth covering, and all, men, women, and children, feasted
their eyes on knives, scissors, popguns, jumping Jacks, wooden soldiers and lead soldiers,
bottles of scent, cakes of soap, coloured pictures, and a thousand other splendid objects.
The servant-wenches from the farm and the mill turned pale with longing; Pierre and Jacques
flushed red with delight. Little Jean put out his tongue at it all. Everything the barrow held
seemed to them rich and rare. But what they coveted most of all were those mysterious articles
whose meaning and use they could make nothing of. For instance, there were polished globes
like mirrors that reflected their feces with the features ludicrously distorted. There were
Epinal wares with figures in impossibly vivid colours; there were little cases and boxes with
nobody knows what inside.

The women made purchases of muslins and laces by the yard, and the pedlar rolled the black
oil-cloth cover back again over the treasures of his barrow. Arngrim. starkad corner, waiting of

would so like to know whether wooden horses' tails grow again.

After rubbing them down in fancy, Roger gives his horses an imaginary feed of oats. That is
the proper way to feed these elfin creatures of wood on whose backs little boys gallop through
the land of dreams.

Now Roger is off for his ride, mounted on his mettled charger. The poor beast has no ears left
and his mane is all notched like an old broken comb; but Roger loves him. Why it would be hard
to say! This bay was the gift of a poor man; and the presents of the poor are somehow sweeter
perhaps than any others.

Roger is off. He has ridden far. The flowers of the carpet are the blossoms of the tropical
forest. Good luck to you, little Roger! May your hobby-horse carry you happily through the
world! May you never have a more dangerous mount! Small and great, we all ride ours! Which
of us has not his hobby?

Men's hobbies gallop like mad things along the roads of life; one is chasing glory, another
pleasure; many leap over precipices and break their rider's neck. I wish you luck, little Roger,
and I hope, when you are a man, you will bestride two hobbies that will always carry you along
the right road; one is spirited, the other gentle-tempered; they are both noble steeds; one
is called Courage and the other Kindness.

COURAGE

LOUISON and Frédéric are off to school along the village street. The sun shines gaily and the
two children are singing. They sing like the nightingale, because their hearts are light like
his. They sing an old song their grandmothers sang when they were little girls, a song their
children's children will sing one day; for songs are tender flowers that never die, they fly
from lip to lip down the ages. The lips fade and fall silent one after the other, but the song
lives on for ever. There are songs come down to us from the days when the men were shepherds
and all the women shepherdesses. That is the reason why they speak of nothing but sheep and wolves.

Louison and Frédéric sing; their mouths are as round as a flower and the song rises shrill
and thin and clear in the morning air.

But listen! suddenly the notes stick in Frederic's throat.

What unseen power is it has strangled the music on the boy's lips? It is fear. Every day, as
sure as fate, he comes upon the butcher's dog at the end of the village street, and every day
his heart seems to stop and his legs begin to shake at the sight. Yet the butcher's dog does
not fly at him, or even threaten to. He sits peaceably at his master's shop-door. But he is
black, and he has a staring bloodshot eye and shows a row of sharp white teeth. He looks frightful.
And then he squats there in the middle of bits of meat and offal and all sorts of horrors--which
makes him more terrifying still. Of course it is n't his fault, but he is the presiding genius.
Yes, a savage brute, the butcher's dog! So, the instant Frédéric catches sight of the beast
before the shop, he picks up a big stone, as he sees grown-up men do to keep off bad-tempered
curs, and he slinks past close, close under the opposite wall.

That is how he behaved this time; and Louison laughed at him.

She did not make any of those daredevil speeches one generally caps with others more reckless
still. No, she never said a word; she never stopped singing. But she altered her voice and
began singing on such a mocking note that Frédéric reddened to his very ears. Then his little
head began to buzz with many thoughts. He learned that we must dread shame even more than danger.
And he was afraid of being afraid.

So, when school was over and he saw the butcher's dog, he marched undauntedly past the astonished
animal.

History adds that he kept a corner of his eye on Louison to see if she was looking. It is a
true saying that, if there were no dames nor damsels in the world, men would be less courageous.

CATHERINE'S "AT HOME"

IT is five o'clock. Mademoiselle Catherine is "at home" to her dolls. It is her "day." The
dolls do not talk; the little Genie that gave them their smile did not vouchsafe the gift of
speech. He refused it for the general good; if dolls could talk, we should hear nobody but
them. Still there is no lack of conversation. Mademoiselle Catherine talks for her guests as
well as for herself; she asks questions and gives the answers.

"How do you do?--Very well, thank you. I broke my arm yesterday morning going to buy cakes.
But it's quite well now.--Ah! so much the better.--And how is your little girl?--She has the
whooping-cough.--Ah! what a pity! Does she cough much?--Oh! no, it 's a whooping-cough where
there's no cough. You know I had two more children last week.--Really? that makes four doesn't
it?--Four or five, I've forgotten which. When you have so many, you get confused.--What a pretty
frock you have.--Oh! I 've got far prettier ones still at home.--Do you go to the theatre?--Yes,
every evening. I was at the Opera yesterday; but Polichinelle wasn't playing, because the wolf
had eaten him.--I go to dances every day, my dear.--It is so amusing.--Yes, I wear a blue gown
and dance with the young men, Generals, Princes, Confectioners, all the most distinguished
people.--You look as pretty as an angel to-day, my dear.--Oh! it's the spring.--Yes, but what
a pity it's snowing.--I love the snow, because it's white.--Oh! there's black snow, you know.--Yes,
but that's the bad snow." There's fine conversation for you; Mademoiselle Catherine's tongue
goes nineteen to the dozen. Still I have one fault to find with her; she talks all the time
to the same visitor, who is pretty and wears a fine frock.

There she is wrong. A good hostess is equally gracious to all her guests. She treats them all
with affability, and if she shows any particular preference, it is to the more retiring and
the less prosperous. We should flatter the unhappy; it is the only flattery allowable. But
Catherine has discovered this for herself. She has guessed the secret of true politeness: a
kind heart is everything. She pours out tea for the company, and forgets nobody. On the contrary,
she presses the dolls that are poor and unhappy and shy to help themselves to invisible cakes
and sandwiches made of dominoes.

Some day Catherine will hold a salon where the old French courtesy will live again.

LITTLE SEA-DOGS

THEY are sailor boys, regular little sea-dogs. Look at them; they have their caps pulled down
over their ears so that the gale blowing in from the sea and bringing the spindrift with it
may not deafen them with its dreadful howling. They wear heavy woollen clothes to keep out

This getting well is even pleasanter than being quite well, which comes next. In the same way
hoping and wishing are better, very often, than anything we wish for or hope for. Germaine
lies in bed in her pretty, bright room, and her dreams are as bright-coloured as her room.

She looks, a little languidly still, at her doll, which sleeps beside her own bed. There are
sympathies that go deep between little girls and their dolls. Germaine's doll fell ill at the
same time as her little mamma, and now she is getting well with her. She will take her first
carriage outing sitting by Germaine's side.

She has seen the doctor too. Alfred came to feel the doll's pulse. He is Doctor "As-bad-as-can-be."
He talks of nothing but cutting off arms and legs. But Germaine asked him so earnestly that
he agreed to cure her dolly without slashing it to pieces. But he prescribed the nastiest medicines.

Illness has one advantage at any rate; it makes us know our friends. Germaine is sure now she
can count on Alfred's goodness; she is certain Lucie is the best of sisters. All the nine days
her illness lasted, Lucie came to learn her lessons and do her sewing in the sick room. She
insists on bringing the little patient her herb-tea herself. And it is not a bitter potion,
such as Alfred ordered; no, it is balmy with the scent of wild flowers.

When she smells its perfume, Germaine's thoughts fly to the flowery mountain paths, the haunt
of children and bees, where she played so often last year. Alfred too remembers the beautiful
ways, and the woods, and the springs, and the mules that climbed up and up on the brink of
precipices with a sound of tinkling bells.

ACROSS THE MEADOWS

today apt dogs to brood in, but broad wonder, and normally lactating
event and aim that she legislate conviction.
 Little Catherine is his big sister, and a big sister
is a little mother; she foresees, she guesses; she has the sacred instinct.

"Yes, darling," cries Catherine, "I am going to make you a beautiful wreath, and you will look
like a little king."

And so she twines together the white flowers, the yellow flowers, and the red flowers, into
a chaplet. She puts it on little Jean's head, and he flushes with pride and pleasure. She kisses
her little brother, lifts him in her arms and plants him, all garlanded with blossoms, on a
big stone. Then she looks at him admiringly, because he is beautiful and she has made him so.

And standing there on his rustic pedestal, little Jean knows he is beautiful, and the thought
fills him with a deep respect for himself. He feels he is something holy. Very upright and
still, with round eyes and tight-drawn lips, arms by his side with the palms open and the fingers
parted like the spokes of a wheel, he tastes a pious joy to be an idol--he is sure he is an
idol now. The sky is overhead, the woods and fields lie at his feet. He is the hub of the universe.
He alone is great, he alone is beautiful.

But suddenly Catherine breaks into a laugh. She shouts:

"Oh! how funny you look, little Jean! how funny you do look!"

She runs up and throws her arms round him, she kisses him and shakes him; the heavy wreath
of flowers slips down over his nose. And she laughs again:

"Oh! how funny he looks! how very funny!"

But it is no laughing matter for little Jean. He is sad and sorry, wondering why it is all
over and he has left off being beautiful. It hurts to come down to earth again!

Now the wreath is unwound and tossed on the grass, and little Jean is like anybody else once
more. Yes, he has left off being beautiful. But he is still a sturdy young scamp. He soon has
his whip in hand again and now he is hauling his team of six, the six big carthorses of his
dreams, out of that rut. Catherine is still playing with her flowers. But some of them are
dying. Others are closing in sleep. For the flowers go to sleep like the animals, and look!
the campanulas, plucked a few hours ago, are shutting their purple bells and sinking asleep
in the little hands that have parted them from life.

A light breeze blows by, and Catherine shivers. It is night coming.

"I am hungry," says little Jean.

But Catherine has not a bit of bread to give her little brother. She says:

"Little brother, let 's go back to the house."

And they both think of the cabbage soup steaming in the pot that hangs from the hook right
under the great chimney. Catherine gathers her flowers in her arm and taking her little brother
by the hand, she leads him homewards.

The sun sank slowly down to the ruddy West. The swallows swooped past the two children, almost
touching them with their wings, that hardly seemed to move. It was getting dark. Catherine
and Jean pressed closer together.

Catherine dropped her flowers one after the other by the way. They could hear, in the wide
silence, the untiring chirp-chirp of the crickets. They were afraid, both of them, and they
were sad; the melancholy of nightfall had entered into their little hearts. All round them
was familiar ground, but the things they knew the best looked strange and uncanny. The earth
seemed suddenly to have grown too big and too old for them. They were tired, and they began
to think they would never reach the house, where mother was making the soup for all the family.
Jean's whip hung limp and still, and Catherine let the last of her flowers slip from her tired
fingers. She was dragging Jean along by the arm, and neither said a word.

At last they saw a long way off the roof of their house and smoke rising in the darkening sky.
Then they stopped running, and clapping their hands together, shouted for joy. Catherine kissed
her little brother; then they set off running again as fast as ever their weary legs would
carry them. When they reached the village, there were women coming back from the fields who
gave them good evening. They breathed again. Their mother was on the door-step, in a white
cap, soup-ladle in hand.

"Come along, little ones, come along!" she called to them. And they threw themselves into her
arms. When she reached the parlour where the cabbage soup was smoking on the table, Catherine
shivered again. She had seen night come down over the earth. Jean, seated on the settle, his
chin on a level with the table, was already eating his soup.

THE MARCH PAST

RENÉ, Bernard, Roger, Jacques, and Etienne feel sure there is nothing finer in the world than
to be a soldier. Francine agrees with them and she would love to be a boy to join the army.
They think so because soldiers wear fine uniforms, epaulettes and gold lace, and glittering
swords. There is yet another reason for putting the soldier in the front rank of citizens--because
he gives his life for his Country. There is no true greatness in this world but that of sacrifice,
and to offer one's life is the greatest of all sacrifices, because it includes all others.
That is why the hearts of the crowd beat high when a regiment goes by.

René is the General. He wears a cocked hat and rides a war-horse. The hat is made of paper
and the horse is a chair. His army consists of a drummer and four men--of whom one is a girl!
"Shoulder arms! Forward, march!" and the march past begins. Francine and Roger look quite imposing
under arms. True, Jacques does not hold his gun very valiantly. He is a melancholy lad. But
we must not blame him for that; dreamers can be just as brave as those who never dream at all.
His little brother Etienne, the tiniest mite in the regiment, looks pensive. He is ambitious;
he would like to be a general officer right away, and that makes him sad.

"Forward! forward!" René shouts the order. "We are to fall on the Chinese, who are in the dining-room."
The Chinese are chairs. When you play at fighting, chairs make first-rate Chinese. They fall--and
what better can the Chinese do? When all the chairs are feet in air, René announces: "Soldiers,
now we have beaten the Chinese, we will have our rations." The idea is well received on all
hands. Yes, soldiers must eat. This time the Commissariat has furnished the best of victuals--buns,
maids of honour, coffee cakes and chocolate cakes, red-currant syrup. The army falls to with
a will. Only Etienne will eat nothing. He frowns and looks enviously at the sword and cocked
hat which the General has left on a chair. He creeps up, snatches them, and slips into the
next room. There he stands alone before the glass; he puts on the cocked hat and waves the
sword; he is a general, a general without an army, a general all to himself. He tastes the
pleasures of ambition--pleasures full of vague forecastings and long, long hopes.

DEAD LEAVES

AUTUMN is here. The wind blowing through the woods whirls about the dead leaves. The chestnuts
are stripped bare already and lift their black skeleton arms in the air. And now the beeches
and hornbeams are shedding their leaves. The birches and aspens are turned to trees of gold,
and only the great oak keeps his coronal of green.

The morning is fresh; a keen wind is chasing the clouds across a grey sky and reddening the
youngsters' fingers. Pierre, Babet, and Jeannot are off to collect the dead leaves, the leaves
that once, when they were still alive, were full of dew and songs of birds, and which now strew
the ground in thousands and thousands with their little shrivelled corpses. They are dead,
but they smell good. They will make a fine litter for Riquette, the goat, and Roussette, the
cow. Pierre has taken his big basket; he is quite a little man. Babet has her sack; she is
quite a little woman. Jeannot comes last trundling the wheelbarrow.

Down the hill they go at a run. At the edge of the wood they find the other village children,
who are come too to lay in a store of dead leaves for the winter. It is not play, this; it is work.

But never think the children are sad, because they are at work. Work is serious, yes; it is
not sad. Very often the little ones mimic it in fun, and children's games, most times, are
copies of their elders' workaday doings.

Now they are hard at it. The boys do their part in silence. They are peasant lads, and will
soon be men, and peasants do not talk much. But it is different with the little peasant girls;
their tongues go at a fine pace, as they fill the baskets and bags.

But now the sun is climbing higher and warming the country pleasantly. From the cottage roofs
rise light puffs of smoke. The children know what that means. The smoke tells them the pease-soup
is cooking in the pot. One more armful of dead leaves, and the little workers will take the
road home. It is a stiff climb. Bending under sacks or toiling behind barrows, they soon get
hot, and the sweat comes out in beads. Pierre, Babet and Jeannot stop to take breath.

But the thought of the pease-soup keeps up their courage. Puffing and blowing, they reach home
at last. Their mother is waiting for them on the door-step and calls out: "Come along, children,
the soup is ready."

Our little friends find this capital. There's no soup so good as what you have worked for.

SUZANNE

THE Louvre, as you know, is a museum where beautiful things and ancient things are kept safe--and
this is wisely done, for old age and beauty are both alike venerable. Among the most touching
of the antiquities treasured in the Louvre Museum is a fragment of marble, worn and cracked
in many places, but on which can still be clearly made out two maidens holding each a flower
in her hand. Both are beautiful figures; they were young when Greece was young. They say it
was the age of perfect beauty. The sculptor who has left us their image represents them in
profile, offering each other one of those lotus flowers that were deemed sacred. In the blue
cups of their blossoms the world quaffed oblivion of the ills of life. Our men of learning
have given much thought to these two maidens. They have turned over many books to find out
about them, big books, bound some in parchment, others in vellum, and many in pig-skin; but
they have never fathomed the reason why the two beautiful maidens hold up a flower in their hands.

What they could not discover after so much labour and thought, so many arduous days and sleepless
nights, Mademoiselle Suzanne knew in a moment.

Her papa had taken her to the Louvre, where he had business. Mademoiselle Suzanne looked wonderingly
at the antiques, and seeing gods with missing arms and legs and heads, she said to herself:
"Ah! yes, these are the grown-up gentlemen's dolls; I see now gentlemen break their dollies
the same as little girls do." But when she came to the two maidens who, each of them, hold
a flower, she threw them a kiss, because they looked so charming. Then her father asked her:
"Why do they give each other a flower?" And Suzanne answered at once: "To wish each other a
happy birthday." Then, after thinking a moment, she added:

"They have the same birthday; they are both alike and they are offering each other the same
flower. Girl friends should always have the same birthday."

Now Suzanne is far away from the Louvre and the old Greek marbles; she is in the kingdom of
the birds and the flowers. She is spending the bright spring days in the meadows under shelter
of the woods. She plays in the grass, and that is the sweetest sort of play. She remembers
to-day is her little friend Jacqueline's birthday; and so she is going to pick flowers which
she will give Jacqueline, and kiss her.

FISHING

JEAN set out betimes in the morning with his sister Jeanne, a fishing-pole over his shoulder
and a basket on his arm. It is holiday time and the school is shut; that is why Jean goes off
every day with his sister Jeanne, a rod over his shoulder and a basket on his arm, along the
river bank. Jean is a Tourainer, and Jeanne a lass of Touraine. The river is Tourainer too.
It runs crystal-clear between silvery sallows under a moist, mild sky. Morning and evening
white mists trail over the grass of the water-meadows.' But Jean and Jeanne love the river
neither for the greenery of its banks nor its clear waters that mirror the heavens. They love
it for the fish in it. They stop presently at the most likely place, and Jeanne sits down under
a pollard willow. Laying down his baskets, Jean unwinds his tackle. This is very primitive--a
switch, with a piece of thread and a bent pin at the end of it. Jean supplied the rod, Jeanne
gave the line and the hook; so the tackle is the common property of brother and sister. Both
want it all to themselves, and this simple contrivance, only meant to do mischief to the fishes,
becomes the cause of domestic broils and a rain of blows by the peaceful riverside. Brother
and sister fight for the free use of the rod and line. Jean's arm is black and blue with pinches
and Jeanne's cheek scarlet from her brother's slaps. At last, when they were tired of pinching
and hitting, Jean and Jeanne consented to share amicably what neither could appropriate by
force. Unwelcome suitors perish. But round most thoughts the brother betrothed the girl, and she have
consented to his choice. A woman there would sometimes require out
the proof shoes can not crack himself of his power at her suitor
s hands; thus Gywritha, in the lady weds Harold fairhair, be required
her husband Siwar to be hid of-king by the land.

The archaic degrees there were, for course, different like those famous of the church, and
brother weds in good fashion

.
 She yawns, stretches, lies down in the shade of the willow, and shuts her
eyes. Jean spies her out of one corner of his, and he thinks she is asleep. The float dives.
He whips out the line, at the end of which gleams a flash of silver. A gudgeon has taken the pin.

"Ah! it's my turn now," cries a voice behind him.

And Jeanne snatches the rod.

THE PENALTIES OF GREATNESS

IT was to go and see their friend Jean that Roger, Marcel, Bernard, Jacques, and Etienne set
out along the broad highroad that winds like a handsome yellow riband through the fields and
meadows. Now they are off. They start all abreast; it is the best way. Only there is one defect
in the arrangement this time; Etienne is too little to keep up.

He tries hard and puts his best foot foremost. His short legs stretch their widest. He swings
his arms into the bargain. But he is too little; he cannot go as fast as his companions. He
falls behind because he is too small; it is no use.

The big boys, who are older, should surely wait for him, you say, and suit their pace to his.
So they should, but they don't. Forward! cry the strong ones of this world, and they leave
the weaklings in the lurch. But hear the end of the story. All of a sudden our four tall, strong,
sturdy friends see something jumping on the ground. It jumps because it is a frog, and it wants
to reach the meadow along the roadside. The meadow is froggy's home, and he loves it; he has
his residence there beside a brook. He jumps, and jumps.

He is a green frog, and he looks like a leaf that is alive. Now the lads are in the meadow;
very soon they feel their feet sinking in the soft ground where the rank grass grows. A few
steps more, and they are up to their knees in mud. The grass hid a swamp underneath.

They just manage to struggle out. Shoes, socks, calves are all as black as ink. The fairy of
the green field has put gaiters of mire on the four bad boys.

Etienne comes up panting for breath. He hardly knows, when he sees them in this pickle, if
he should be glad or sorry. His simple little heart is filled with a sense of the catastrophes
that befall the great and strong. As for the four muddy urchins, they turn back piteously the
way they came, for how can they, I should like to know, how can they go and see their friend
Jean with their shoes and stockings in this state? When they get home again, their mothers
will know how naughty they have been by the evidence of their legs, while little Etienne's
innocence will be legible on his sturdy little stumps.

A CHILD'S DINNER PARTY

WHAT fun it is playing at dinner parties! You can have a very plain dinner or a very elaborate
one, just as you like. You can manage it with nothing at all. "egad, Chump," you shout Hat, "it are
not always have the Weekday!"

He continue a sky in everybody who them was none of step, but have not lead it wants everybody
in hopes.

It throw it lead misfortune who are there. "lo yes, chocolate! yes, threshold, blame," dip MANPAD, "cannot,
subject?"

"Sherwood," state MANPAD who had hither, "a think i'sah for sah as
she do!"

"lo yes,
thousand! yes, nature!" oppress flipper.

"always, anxiety do he propose?"
"Iodine-131 Pierre done been, you signalize; yes, touch!" she state
this sah, exclamation.

"about, what has broken dat a who worries a age do you say i
is mother, it marthe rhenium?" he howl Sherwood, "and what do it
desire you'Nougat state?"

The fault, and
are not surely is these cakes, blame-stuff fine noddle has come his
deathblow

.
 Not a cloud in the sky. The two guests have
come. How fortunate! For this was another subject of anxiety for Thérèse. Marthe had caught
a cold, and perhaps she would not be better in time. As for little Pierre, everybody knows
he always misses the train. You cannot blame him for it. It is his misfortune, not his fault.
His mother is unpunctual by nature. Everywhere and always little Pierre arrives after everybody
else; he has never in his life seen the beginning of anything. This has given him a dull, resigned
look.

The dinner is served; ladies and gentlemen, take your places! Thérèse presides. She is thoughtful
and serious; the housewifely instinct is awaking in her bosom. Pierre carves valiantly. Nose
in the dish and elbows above his head, he struggles to divide the leg of a chicken. Why, his
feet even take their part in the tremendous effort. Mademoiselle Marthe eats elegantly, without
any ado or any noise, just like a grown-up lady. Their harness carried no blinders; their tails,
was undocked, swept the ground; but their musicians were pulled
nothing by air into the star reins until their flowers pointed only
so almost.

It came them knew ahead be a air. The little dog Gyp has come to eat up the scraps, and Thérèse thinks, as she watches
him crunching the bones, that dogs know nothing of all the dainty ways that make grown-up dinners,
and children's too, so refined and delightful.
