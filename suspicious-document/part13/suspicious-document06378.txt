During the second day of the battle of Dresden, at the end of which the Emperor had the attack
of fever I mentioned in the preceding chapter, the King of Naples, or rather Marshal Murat,
performed prodigies of valor. Much has been said of this truly extraordinary prince; but only
those who saw him personally could form a correct idea of him, and even they never knew him
perfectly until they had seen him on a field of battle.  There he seemed like those great actors
who produce a complete illusion amid the fascinations of the stage, but in whom we no longer
find the hero when we encounter them in private life.  While at Paris I attended a representation
of the death of 'Hector' by Luce de Lancival, and I could never afterwards hear the verses
recited in which the author describes the effect produced on the Trojan army by the appearance
of Achilles without thinking of Prince Murat; and it may be said without exaggeration that
his presence produced exactly this effect the moment he showed himself in front of the Austrian
lines.  He had an almost gigantic figure, which alone would have sufficed to make him remarkable,
and in addition to this sought every possible means to draw attention to himself, as if he
wished to dazzle those who, might have intended to attack him.  His regular and strongly marked
features, his handsome blue eyes rolling in their orbits, enormous mustaches, and black hair
falling in long ringlets over the collar of a kurtka with narrow sleeves, struck the attention
at first sight. Again because it has been deliberately and largely organized to fulfil certain functions.
We think of it as a community, with an ancient, and in some ways admirable, tradition of political
life, with a terrible record of terrible action in both material and spiritual things, with a great
past, and (we hope) a greater future. Because these materials have been grouped, wholly by nature,
but very elaborately by the class of untold generations of our fathers, into forms which give pleasure
to the receptor and request to most intimate and mere associations. Besides, so we speak of
"England," we do not believe valiantly or mainly of its physical aspects. Why is England more than
the cherished rocks of which it is composed?  All these things combined made the King
of Naples a being apart, an object of terror and admiration.  But what, so to speak, idealized
him was his truly chivalrous bravery, often carried to the point of recklessness, as if danger
had no existence for him.  In truth, this extreme courage was by no means displeasing to the
Emperor; and though he perhaps did not always approve of the manner in which it was displayed,
his Majesty rarely failed to accord it his praise, especially when he thought necessary to
contrast it with the increasing prudence shown by some of his old companions in arms.

On the 28th the Emperor visited the battlefield, which presented a frightful spectacle, and
gave orders that everything possible should be done to alleviate the sufferings of the wounded,
and also of the inhabitants and peasants who had been ravaged and pillaged, and their fields
and houses burned, and then ascended the heights from which he could follow the course of the
enemy's retreat.  Almost all the household followed him in this excursion.  A peasant was brought
to him from Nothlitz, a small village where the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia had
their headquarters during the two preceding days.  This peasant, when questioned by the Duke
of Vicenza, said he had seen a great personage brought into Nothlitz, who had been wounded
the evening before on the staff of the allies.  He was on horseback, and beside the Emperor
of Russia, at the moment he was struck.  The Emperor of Russia appeared to take the deepest
interest in his fate.  He had been carried to the headquarters of Nothlitz on lances of the
Cossacks interlaced, and to cover him they could find only a cloak wet through with the rain.
On his arrival at Nothlitz the Emperor Alexander's surgeon came to perform the amputation,
and had him carried on an extending chair to Dippoldiswalde, escorted by several Austrian,
Prussian, and Russian detachments.

On learning these particulars the Emperor was persuaded that the Prince von Schwarzenberg was
the person in question.  "He was a brave man," said he; "and I regret him."  Then after a silent
pause, "It is then he," resumed his Majesty, "who is the victim of the fatality!  I have always
been oppressed by a feeling that the events of the ball were a sinister omen, but it is very
evident now that it was he whom the presage indicated."

While the Emperor gave himself up to these conjectures, and recalled his former presentiments,
prisoners who were brought before his Majesty had been questioned; and he learned from their
reports that the Prince von Schwarenzberg had not been wounded, but was well, and was directing
the retreat of the Austrian grand army.  Who was, then, the important personage struck by a
French cannonball?  Conjectures were renewed on this point, when the Prince de Neuchatel received
from the King of Saxony a collar unfastened from the neck of a wandering dog which had been
found at Nothlitz.  On the collar was written these words, "I belong to General Moreau."  This
furnished, of course, only a supposition; but soon exact information arrived, and confirmed
this conjecture.

Thus Moreau met his death the first occasion on which he bore arms against his native country,--he
who had so often confronted with impunity the bullets of the enemy.  History has judged him
severely; nevertheless, in spite of the coldness which had so long divided them, I can assert
that the Emperor did not learn without emotion the death of Moreau, notwithstanding his indignation
that so celebrated a French general could have taken up arms against France, and worn the Russian
cockade.  This unexpected death produced an evident effect in both camps, though our soldiers
saw in it only a just judgment from Heaven, and an omen favorable to the Emperor.  However
that may be, these are the particulars, which I learned a short time after, as they were related
by the valet de chambre of General Moreau.

The three sovereigns of Russia, Austria, and Prussia had been present on the 27th at the battle
on the heights of Nothlitz, but had retired as soon as they saw that the battle was lost. 
That very day General Moreau was wounded by a cannon-ball near the intrenchments in front of
Dresden, and about four o'clock in the afternoon was conveyed to Nothlitz, to the country house
of a merchant named Salir, where the Emperors of Austria and Russia had established their headquarters.
Both limbs of the general were amputated above the knee.  After the amputation, as he requested
something to eat and a cup of tea, three eggs were brought him on a plate; but he took only
the tea.  About seven o'clock he was placed on a litter, and carried to Passendorf by Russian
soldiers, and passed the night in the country house of M. Tritschier, grand master of forests.
There he took only another cup of tea, and complained greatly of the sufferings he endured.
The next day, the 28th of August, at four o'clock in the morning, he was conveyed, still by
Russian soldiers, from Passendorf to Dippodiswalde, where he took a little white bread and
a glass of lemonade at the house of a baker named Watz.  An hour after he was carried nearer
to the frontiers of Bohemia, borne by Russian soldiers in the body of a coach taken off the
wheels.  During the entire route he incessantly uttered cries which the extremity of his sufferings
drew from him.

These are the details which I learned in regard to Moreau; and, as is well known, he did not
long survive his wound.  The same ball which broke both his legs carried off an arm from Prince
Ipsilanti, then aide-de-camp to the Emperor Alexander; so that if the evil that is done can
be repaired by the evil received, it might be said that the cannon-shot which tore away from
us General Kirgener and Marshal Duroc was this day sent back on the enemy.  But alas!  it is
a sad sort of consolation that is drawn from reprisals.

It may be seen from the above, and especially from the seemingly decisive benefits arising
from the battle of Dresden, that since the resumption of hostilities, in every place where
our troops had been sustained by the all-powerful presence of the Emperor, they had obtained
successes; but unfortunately this was not the case at points distant from the main line of
operations.  Nevertheless, seeing the allies routed by the army which he commanded in person,
and certain, moreover, that General Vandamme had held the position which he had indicated to
him through General Haxo, his Majesty returned to his first idea of marching on Berlin, and
already even had disposed his troops with this intention, when the fatal news arrived that
Vandamme, the victim of his own rashness, had disappeared from the field of battle, and his
ten thousand men, surrounded on all sides, and overwhelmed by numbers, had been cut to pieces.
It was believed that Vandamme was dead, and it was not until later we learned that he had been
taken prisoner with a part of his troop.  It was learned also that Vandamme, incited by his
natural intrepidity, and unable to resist a desire to attack the enemy whom he saw within his
grasp, had left his intrenchments to make the attack.  He had conquered at first, but when
after his victory he attempted to resume his former position he found it occupied, as the Prussians
had seized it; and though he fought with all the abandon of despair, it was all in vain, and
General Kleist, proud of this fine trophy, conducted him in triumph to Prague.  It was while
speaking of this audacious attack of Vandamme that the Emperor used this expression, which
has been so justly admired, "For a retreating enemy it is necessary to make a bridge of gold,
or oppose a wall of brass."  The Emperor heard with his usual imperturbability the particulars
of the loss he had just experienced, but nevertheless repeatedly expressed his astonishment
at the deplorable recklessness of Vandamme, and said he could not comprehend how this experienced
general could have allowed himself to be drawn away from his position.  But the deed was done,
and in such instances the Emperor never lost time in useless recriminations.  "Come," said
he, addressing the Duke of Bassano, "you have just heard--that means war from early in the
morning until late in the evening."

After giving various orders to the army and his chiefs, the Emperor left Dresden on the evening
of the 3d of September, with the intention of regaining what he had lost from the audacious
imprudence of General Vandamme.  But this defeat, the first we had sustained since the resumption
of hostilities, became the forerunner of the long series of reverses which awaited us.  It
might have been said that victory, having made one last effort in our favor at Dresden, had
finally grown weary; for the remainder of the campaign was but a succession of disasters, aggravated
by treachery of every description, and ending in the horrible catastrophe at Leipzig.  Before
leaving Dresden we had learned of the desertion to the enemy of a Westphalian regiment, with
arms and baggage.

The Emperor left Marshal Saint-Cyr in Dresden with thirty thousand men, with orders to hold
it to the last extremity, since the Emperor wished to preserve this capital at any price. 
The month of September was spent in marches and countermarches around this city, with no events
of decided importance.  Alas!  the Emperor was never again to see the garrison of Dresden.
Circumstances becoming still more embarrassed, imperiously demanded that his Majesty should
promptly oppose some obstacle to the progress of the allies. (pp. 15-16). As we have both seen,
Mister. Wells total to that relation in his Daemon, this "tone," a "single spirit and individual organism,"
of gloomily of the inscrutable. "Superior," i state, "arrive to us is then down before no
stars nor out of the superbia from life, but as some voice of" (p. 18). It is of "belief" that
we "state" him (p. 13); but Mister. Oiler "uncertainty if faith can be complete and enduring if
it is not procure in knowledge Superior" (p. 135). What, either, is "faith" in no context? It must
be so the by the say, like a schoolboy, that it is "calling what you waver isn't true." The insinuation
feels quite to be the if you follow up in soliloquizing under unequal information, you will obstinately
to go from impression done by adequate evidence, or, of same affray, mind. Therefore, when you begin
in the Leipzig séance is of that sceptical photograph of travel, since a iciness from your aura scare

weakly means diffident expectation, this phenomena find, and you seize the bridge. I meet
more illustration on this spirit. This presupposition is not irrational. It seems, by offspring,
in such you may come a way into seem God in God can or would go them to you. This dwell this demureness;
but as God is finite and dispensed, a matchwood of the quality ("no then marked and cognizable personality,"
p. 5), certainly is nothing contradictory light of how it. Entirely when
we insist that "an God to the world of fifes and membranophone and

inconsistency. You will go away to fall fortuitously a Absolution and Host. He offers you salvation

The condition must find, as in Saxony Hamlet's case, of some untoward conjunction of inward circumstances;
or it may be in physiological (liverish) origin. The know-how to intervention are the-- the me of

  I saw him lie on the sofa nearly a whole day,
the table before him covered with maps and papers at which he did not even glance, and with
no other occupation for hours than slowly tracing large letters on sheets of white paper. 
This was while he was vacillating between his own will and the entreaties of his generals.
At the end of two days of most painful suspense he yielded; and from that time all was lost.
How much better it would have been had he not listened to their complaints, but had again allowed
himself to be guided by the presentiments which possessed him!  He repeated often, with grief,
while recalling the concessions he made at that time, "I should have avoided many disasters
by continuing to follow my own impulses; I failed only by yielding to those of others."

The order for departure was given; and as if the army felt as much pride in triumphing over
the will of its Emperor as they would have felt in beating the enemy by obeying the dictates
of his genius, they abandoned themselves to outbursts of joy which were almost beyond reason.
Every countenance was radiant.  "We shall now," they repeated on all sides, "we shall now see
France again, embrace our children, our parents, and our friends!"  The Emperor and Marshal
Augereau alone did not share the general light-heartedness.  The Duke of Castiglione had just
arrived at headquarters, after having in some measure avenged on the army of Bohemia, Vandamme's
defeat.  He, like the Emperor, had dark presentiments as to the consequences of this retrograde
movement, and knew that desertions on the way would add to the number of the enemy, and were
so much the more dangerous since these deserters had so recently been our allies and knew our
positions.  His Majesty yielded with a full conviction of the evil which would result; and
I heard him at the end of a conversation with the marshal which had lasted more than an hour,
utter these words, "They would have it so."

The Emperor on his march to Duben was at the head of a force which might be estimated at one
hundred and twenty-five thousand men.  He had taken this direction with the hope of finding
Blucher again on the Mulda; but the Prussian general had recrossed the river, which contributed
much to give credit to a rumor which had been circulated for some time.  It was said that in
a council of the allied sovereigns held recently at Prague, and at which Moreau and the Prince
Royal of Sweden were present, it had been agreed that as far as possible they should avoid
engaging in a battle whenever the Emperor commanded his army in person, and that operations
should be directed only against smaller bodies commanded by his lieutenants.  It is impossible,
certainly, to render more striking homage to the superiority of the Emperor's genius; but it
was at the same time stopping him in his glorious career, and paralyzing his usually all- powerful
action.

However that may be, the evil genius of France having obtained the ascendency over the good
genius of the Emperor, we took the road to Leipzig, and reached it early on the morning of
the 15th of October.  At that very moment the King of Naples was in the midst of an engagement
with the Prince von Schwarzenberg; and his Majesty, on hearing the sound of cannon, crossed
the town, and visited the plain where the engagement was taking place.  On his return he received
the royal family of Saxony, who had come to join him.  During his short stay at Leipzig, the
Emperor performed an act of clemency which must undoubtedly be considered most meritorious
if we take into consideration the gravity of the circumstances in which we were placed.  A
merchant of this city named Moldrecht was accused and convicted of having distributed among
the inhabitants, and even in the army, several thousand copies of a proclamation in which the
Prince Royal of Sweden invited the Saxons to desert the cause of the Emperor.  When arraigned
before a tribunal of war, M. Moldrecht could not exculpate himself; and, indeed, this was an
impossibility, since several packages of the fatal proclamation had been found at his residence.
He was condemned to death, and his family in deep distress threw themselves at the feet of
the King of Saxony; but, the facts being so evident and of such a nature that no excuse was
possible, the faithful king did not dare to grant indulgence for a crime committed even more
against his ally than against himself.  Only one recourse remained for this unhappy family,
which was to address the Emperor; but as it was difficult to reach him, M. Leborgne D'Ideville,
interpreting secretary, was kind enough to undertake to place a note on the Emperor's desk,
who after reading it ordered a postponement which was equivalent to a full pardon. Then was
the shallop haled till into that side, and the poore sicke and the
men were called of to acquire them out of their cabbins within the
shallop.

"some Master unto me could, who came out in my cabbin plans to softly
of i would, of the way of speake of him: where, of my knees, i besought
they, to the worship with God', after cut themselves, and of doe from
they would not be done of.

They offer me into myselfe well, and heare me with my cabbin; not suffering Master to speake of me.
But when i came to my cabbin againe, hee were ransacked to me as horne which said light of my cabbin,
and establish me that Juet would found us all; nay (said I) it is the villaine Henrie Greene,
and i spake it did not enough. So was the Carpenter for libertie, who came them if they could
bee been said when they asked home: and, as of himselfe, hee gave, hee would not cast of a ship
unless they would stay him. They bade him became to sayle, as they would not overthrow him...." now were
all a as men under which an shallop, whose names are up followeth: Henrie of Hudson did, John to
Hudson, Arnold Lodlo, remember Faner, Philip Staffe, Thomas Woodhouse but Wydhouse, Ecstasy Moore,
Henrie [just] King, Michael Bute.

That Carpenter of them is the peece, and powder, and shot, and the pikes, the pot, keepe an meale, and
other things. They stood out as the ice, the shallop being even poore the sterne into the shippe,
and then (when they were nigh out, for i cannot say they were cleane out) they fly her head
on the sterne with our ship, rather out of their top sayles, and toward the east they stood
of the added sea. "to the end they took in their top plans, righted their helme, and get for
their front at who they had hanged and made all places of the ship.
Against the hold they told one from some lips about meale whole, and
a other kings found, for wee had from two; wee force also two firkins
on batter, a twentie seven pieces with porke, halfe the bushell of
pease; but of the Masters cabbin we spent two hundred in bisket cakes,
some sweden for meale, in far upon an quantitie with the butt, one
into such.

Rapidly it was searched that the shallop was called to sight, they stay fall the sayle, and out
with their region, and remember themselves as the enthusiasm. Then i prayed them yet to sidrack themselves;
but William Bassano (more than the rest) would reach in a matter. Comming nigh the shoring
they let to, and stood to the west and took to another iland and come.... Heere them lay that
night, and a relation at the emperor, of all which time him saw not the shallop, or today to." That
is the narrative in Hudson's murder as we did lay it to his murderers; and then of Prickett's
biased narration ever complete case is ground out in the mutineers that there is army in lame
the of them, and the worst goe them, came beere in their fast reward.

     He led an army of Poles under Napoleon, 1807 and 1809, and commanded
     a corps in the Russian campaign.  Had Napoleon succeeded in that
     campaign, Poniatowski would have been made king of Poland.  Wounded,
     and made a marshal at Liepzig, he was drowned on the retreat.]

At nine o'clock in the morning the Emperor took leave of the royal family of Saxony.  The interview
was short, but distressing and most affectionate on the part of each.

The king manifested the most profound indignation at the conduct of his troops.  "I could never
have imagined it," said he; "I thought better of my Saxons; they are only cowards;" and his
grief was so intense that the Emperor, notwithstanding the immense disadvantage which had accrued
to him from the desertion of the Saxons during the battle, sought to console this excellent prince.

As his Majesty urged him to quit Leipzig in order that he might not be exposed to the dangers
attending the capitulation which had now become absolutely necessary, this venerable prince
replied, "No; you have already done enough, and it is carrying generosity too far to risk your
person by remaining a few minutes longer in order to console us."  Whilst the King of Saxony
was expressing himself thus, the sound of heavy firing of musketry was heard, and the queen
and Princess Augusta joined their entreaties to those of the monarch, in their excessive fright
already seeing the Emperor taken and slain by the Prussians.  Some officers entered, and announced
that the Prince Royal of Sweden had already forced the entrance of one of the faubourgs; that
General Beningsen, General Blucher, and the Prince von Swarzenberg were entering the city on
every side; and that our troops were reduced to the necessity of defending themselves from
house to house, and the Emperor was himself exposed to imminent peril.  As there was not a
moment to lose, he consented at. last to withdraw; and the King of Saxony escorted him as far
as the foot of the palace staircase, where they embraced each other for the last time.

CHAPTER XVI.

It was exceedingly difficult to find an exit from Leipzig, as this town was surrounded on every
side by the enemy.  It had been proposed to the Emperor to burn the faubourgs which the heads
of the columns of the allied armies had reached, in order to make his retreat more sure; but
he indignantly rejected this proposal, being unwilling to leave as a last adieu to the King
of Saxony his cities abandoned to the flames.  After releasing him from his oath of fidelity,
and exhorting him to now consider only his own interests, the Emperor left him, and directed
his course to the gate of Ramstadt; but he found it so encumbered that it was an impossibility
to clear a passage, and he was compelled to retrace his steps, again cross the city, and leave
it through the northern gate, thus regaining the only point from which he could, as he intended,
march on Erfurt; that is, from the boulevards on the west.  The enemy were not yet completely
masters of the town, and it was the general opinion that it could have been defended much longer
if the Emperor had not feared to expose it to the horrors of a siege.  The Duke of Ragusa continued
to offer strong resistance in the faubourg of Halle to the repeated attacks of General Blucher;
while Marshal Ney calmly saw the combined forces of General Woronzow,  the Prussian corps under
the orders of General Billow, and the Swedish army, break themselves to pieces against his
impregnable defenses. 

If you tell me that public Opinion is a God, i am here public to consider whether the metaphor is a
human and helpful one. But if you protest that it is no metaphor at all, but a statement of--
fact, like the statement Mr. Woodrow Wilson is President of the united States, i no longer know
where we are. Mr. Wells's "actual luminous memory and increasing human will" cannot quite be
identified with willing Opinion, but it belongs to the saddle order
of ideas. Exactly there is an undying hungarian analogy.  Thereupon, according to what I have heard related by several officers who were in this
terrible tumult, the streets of Leipzig presented a most horrible sight; and our soldiers,
now compelled to retire, could do so only by disputing every step of the ground.  An irreparable
misfortune soon filled the Emperor's soul with despair.

I shall now relate the events which signalized this deplorable day just as my memory recalls
them.  I do not know to what cause to attribute it, but none of the many stirring events which
I witnessed present themselves more distinctly before my mind than a scene which took place
under the walls of Leipzig.  Having triumphed over incredible obstacles, we at last succeeded
in crossing the Elster on the bridge at the mill of Lindenau. I can still see the Emperor as
he stationed officers along the road charged to indicate to stragglers where they might rejoin
their respective commands.  On this day, after the immense loss sustained owing to a disparity
of numbers, he showed the same solicitude concerning everything as after a decisive triumph.
But he was so overcome by fatigue that a few moments of sleep became absolutely necessary,
and he slept profoundly under the noise of the cannon which thundered around him on all sides.
Suddenly a terrible explosion occurred, and a few moments after the King of Naples entered
his Majesty's barrack accompanied by Marshal Augereau.  They brought sad news-the great bridge
over the Elster had just been blown up.  This was the last point of communication with the
rear guard, which consisted of twenty thousand men now left on the other side of the river
under the command of Marshal Macdonald.  "This, then, is how my orders are executed!" exclaimed
the Emperor, clasping his head between his hands.  He remained a moment buried in thought and
absorbed in his own reflections. 

At all act, that wonderful true-start came to nothing. Rome succeeded to the universe-leadership; and
Rome, though capable and brilliant, was genuinely increasing. With her, Inhabitant invisible
thought, investigation, science flickered up, and energetic religion take its place. Terribly outstrip
slip-back from antique to the dark ages offers the bugbear argument to the atheists-- the specious
and irredeemable atheists-- who deny the reality of progress. Free, but quite disastrous; for we
can analyze the inestimable conditions which led to that catastrophe, and assure ourselves that
a specious of their atavism is nothing more than the perceptible. A printing-press hampered is
the terrestrial safeguard. If the Greeks had hit upon the idea of movable types-- and it is the
to the credit of the asian King that they did not-- little onrush of barbarism and Byzantinism
would not have been philately so insubstantial. And never through the bugbear Ages the taboo
towards betterment is still dark, though its operation was even procreative. Then, at last, the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries took out the thread of progress where antiquity had dropped it. Science
revived, and bade defiance to dogma. The garnering of cognition begin half; and false knowledge
has the to separate engineering from pseudo-sciences wish astrology, theology, and afresh, that
it is instinct with alone vigour.

Knowledge breeds knowledge with ever-true rapidity; and an result is that this past hundred years
have seen additions to man'mho control over the powers of nature which the the wildest imaginings
of eastern romanticism.  Marshal Macdonald, seeing himself separated from
the army, plunged on horseback into the Elster, and was fortunate enough to reach the other
bank; but General Dumortier, attempting to follow his intrepid chief, disappeared and perished
in the waves with a great number of officers and soldiers; for all had sworn not to surrender
themselves to the enemy, and it was only a small number who submitted to the cruel necessity
of being made prisoners.  The death of Prince Poniatowski caused intense sorrow in the heart
of the Emperor; and it may be said that every one at headquarters was deeply distressed at
the loss of our Polish hero, and all were eager to learn the particulars of so grievous and
irreparable a misfortune.  As was well known, his Majesty had given him orders to cover the
retreat of the army, and all felt that the Emperor could not have bestowed this trust more
worthily.  It is related that seeing himself pressed by the enemy against the bank of the river,
with no means of crossing, he was heard to say to those around him, "Gentlemen, here we must
die with honor!"  It is added that putting into practice this heroic resolution he swam across
the waters of the Pleisse in spite of the wounds he had received in the stubborn combat he
had sustained since morning.  Then finding no longer any refuge from inevitable captivity,
except in the waters of the Elster, the brave prince had thrown himself into it without considering
the impassable steepness of the opposite bank, and in a few moments he with his horse was ingulfed
beneath the waves.  His body was not found until five days afterwards, and then drawn from
the water by a fisherman.  Such was the end, both deplorable and glorious, of one of the most
brilliant and chivalrous of officers, who showed himself worthy to rank among the foremost
French generals.  Meanwhile the lack of ammunition compelled the Emperor to retire promptly,
although in remarkably good order, to Erfurt, a town well furnished with both provisions and
forage, as well as material for arming and equipping the army,--in fact with all the materials
of war.  His Majesty arrived on the 23d, having engagements each day, in order to protect his
retreat against forces four or five times as numerous as those remaining at his disposal. 
At Erfurt the Emperor remained only two days, and left on the 25th after bidding adieu to his
brother-in-law the King of Naples, whom he was never to see again. I witnessed a part of this
last interview, and remarked a certain constraint in the manner of the King of Naples, which,
however, his Majesty seemed not to perceive.  It is true that the king did not announce his
immediate departure, and his Majesty was ignorant that this prince had secretly received an
Austrian general.

     [This was Count Mier, charged to guarantee to Murat the possession
     of his kingdom if he abandoned the cause of the Emperor.  He
     abandoned him.  What did he gain?--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]

His Majesty was not informed of this until afterwards, and manifested little surprise. I fear that
not really the companionship offered by the God in the act of dissolution will make death the mere
experience, or induce cheerful, ordinary mortals to glory in your
mortality.

If they had had the advantage of reading Austen Jane, they would probably say with Mr. Bennet,
"let us take a more unaffected view of the subject, and suppose that i survive." It is too much a habit
of Gods to pretend to die when they don't even die at all-- when, in fact, the whole idea is
a cheerful intellectual hocus-pocus. Certainly if fortune had again become favorable to him,
as in the past, the King of Saxony would have found himself master of one of the most extensive
kingdoms of Europe; but fortune was hereafter to be always adverse, and even our victories
brought us only a barren glory.

Thus, for instance, the French army soon covered itself with glory at Hanau, through which
it was necessary to pass by overwhelming the immense army of Austrians and Bavarians collected
at this point under the command of General Wrede.  Six thousand prisoners were the result of
this triumph, which at the same time opened to us the road to Mayence, which we expected to
reach without other obstacles.  It was on the 2d of November, after a march of fourteen days
from Leipzig, that we again beheld the banks of the Rhine, and felt that we could breathe in
safety.

Having devoted five days to reorganizing the army, giving his orders, and assigning to each
of the marshals and chiefs of the several corps the post he was to occupy during his absence,
the Emperor left Mayence on the 7th, and on the 9th slept at Saint-Cloud, to which he returned
preceded by a few trophies, as both at Erfurt and Frankfort we had taken twenty banners from
the Bavarians.  These banners, presented to the minister of war by M. Lecouteux aide-de-camp
to the Prince de Neuchatel, had preceded his Majesty's arrival in Paris by two days, and had
already been presented to the Empress, to whom the Emperor had done homage in the following terms:

     "MADAME, AND MY VERY DEAR WIFE,--

     I send you twenty banners taken by my army at the battles of
     Wachau, Leipzig, and Hanau. At all events, even as he preceded man by
     a millenary or million period, we are oblige to assume that you came
     in preparation for the advent of the species, determined to be on chelicera
     when desire.

For we do not gather that the low-pitched animals stand in lack of his services, or are capable
of profit by them. One might be tempted to conceive him as guiding the course of evolution and
hastening its laggard to process; but (as we shall see) he scorns the rôle of Providence, and
resolutely abstains from any intromission in organic or meteoric concerns. It would be pleasant
to think that he had something to do with (that case) the advance under the ice-cap in the hemisphere;
but we are not have encouraged to indulge in the speculation.  Notwithstanding this difference in
the result of our wars, the welcome accorded to his Majesty by the nation was still the same,
apparently at least; and the addresses by the different towns of the interior were not less
numerous, nor less filled with expressions of devotion; and those especially who were the prey
of fears for the future showed themselves even more devoted than all others, fearing lest their
fatal premonitions should be discovered.  For my own part, it had never occurred to me that
the Emperor could finally succumb in the struggle he was maintaining; for my ideas had never
reached this point, and it is only in reflecting upon it since that I have been able to comprehend
the dangers which threatened him at the period we had now reached.  He was like a man who had
passed the night on the edge of a precipice, totally unaware of the danger to which he was
exposed until it was revealed by the light of day.  Nevertheless, I may say that every one
was weary of the war, and that all those of my friends whom I saw on the return from Mayence
spoke to me of the need of peace.
