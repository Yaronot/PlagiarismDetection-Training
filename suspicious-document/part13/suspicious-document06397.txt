Up betimes and my father with me, and he and I all the morning and Will Stankes private, in
my wife's closet above, settling our matters concerning our Brampton estate, &c., and I find
that there will be, after all debts paid within L100, L50 per annum clear coming towards my
father's maintenance, besides L25 per annum annuities to my Uncle Thomas and Aunt Perkins.
Of which, though I was in my mind glad, yet thought it not fit to let my father know it thoroughly,
but after he had gone out to visit my uncle Thomas and brought him to dinner with him, and
after dinner I got my father, brother Tom, and myself together, I did make the business worse
to them, and did promise L20 out of my own purse to make it L50 a year to my father, propounding
that Stortlow may be sold to pay L200 for his satisfaction therein and the rest to go towards
payment of debts and legacies.  The truth is I am fearful lest my father should die before
debts are paid, and then the land goes to Tom and the burden of paying all debts will fall
upon the rest of the land.  Not that I would do my brother any real hurt.  I advised my father
to good husbandry and to living within the compass of L50 a year, and all in such kind words,
as not only made, them but myself to weep, and I hope it will have a good effect.  That being
done, and all things agreed on, we went down, and after a glass of wine we all took horse,
and I, upon a horse hired of Mr. Game, saw him out of London, at the end of Bishopsgate Street,
and so I turned and rode, with some trouble, through the fields, and then Holborn, &c., towards
Hide Park, whither all the world, I think, are going, and in my going, almost thither, met
W. Howe coming galloping upon a little crop black nag; it seems one that was taken in some
ground of my Lord's, by some mischance being left by his master, a thief; this horse being
found with black cloth ears on, and a false mayne, having none of his own; and I back again
with him to the Chequer, at Charing Cross, and there put up my own dull jade, and by his advice
saddled a delicate stone-horse of Captain Ferrers's, and with that rid in state to the Park,
where none better mounted than I almost, but being in a throng of horses, seeing the King's
riders showing tricks with their managed horses, which were very strange, my stone-horse was
very troublesome, and begun to, fight with other horses, to the dangering him and myself, and
with much ado I got out, and kept myself out of harm's way..  Here I saw nothing good, neither
the King, nor my Lady Castlemaine, nor any great ladies or beauties being there, there being
more pleasure a great deal at an ordinary day; or else those few good faces that there were
choked up with the many bad ones, there being people of all sorts in coaches there, to some
thousands, I think.  Going thither in the highway, just by the Park gate, I met a boy in a
sculler boat, carried by a dozen people at least, rowing as hard as he could drive, it seems
upon some wager.  By and by, about seven or eight o'clock, homeward; and changing my horse
again, I rode home, coaches going in great crowds to the further end of the town almost.  In
my way, in Leadenhall Street, there was morris-dancing which I have not seen a great while.
So set my horse up at Game's, paying 5s. for him.  And so home to see Sir J. Minnes, who is
well again, and after staying talking with him awhile, I took leave and went to hear Mrs. Turner's
daughter, at whose house Sir J. Minnes lies, play on the harpsicon; but, Lord! it was enough
to make any man sick to hear her; yet I was forced to commend her highly. It fear i hesitate his

  This is talked of among us, but how true I

Vandike's, in crayon in little, done exceedingly well.  Having thus freely
talked with him, and of many more things, I took leave, and by coach to
St. James's, and there told Mr. Coventry what I had done with my Lord with
great satisfaction, and so well pleased home, where I found it almost
night, and my wife and the dancing-master alone above, not dancing but
talking.  Now so deadly full of jealousy I am that my heart and head did
so cast about and fret that I could not do any business possibly, but went
out to my office, and anon late home again and ready to chide at every
thing, and then suddenly to bed and could hardly sleep, yet durst not say
any thing, but was forced to say that I had bad news from the Duke
concerning Tom Hater as an excuse to my wife, who by my folly has too much
opportunity given her with the man, who is a pretty neat black
man, but married.  But it is a deadly folly and plague that I bring upon
myself to be so jealous and by giving myself such an occasion more than my
wife desired of giving her another month's dancing.  Which however shall
be ended as soon as I can possibly.  But I am ashamed to think what a
course I did take by lying to see whether my wife did wear drawers to-day
as she used to do, and other things to raise my suspicion of her, but I
found no true cause of doing it.

16th.  Up with my mind disturbed and with my last night's doubts upon me, for which I deserve
to be beaten if not really served as I am fearful of being, especially since God knows that
I do not find honesty enough in my own mind but that upon a small temptation I could be false
to her, and therefore ought not to expect more justice from her, but God pardon both my sin
and my folly herein.  To my office and there sitting all the morning, and at noon dined at
home. Thither, be continuing, we travel round taking and period, wherever do he was necessary, for

     Royal Society," vol. i., p. 85).  Peter Pett had already built a
     yacht for the king at Deptford.]

and so to Woolwich town, where at an alehouse I found them ready to attend my coming, and so
took boat again, it being cold, and I sweating, with my walk, which was very pleasant along
the green come and pease, and most of the way sang, he and I, and eat some cold meat we had,
and with great pleasure home, and so he took horse again, and Pembleton coming, we danced a
country dance or two and so broke up and to bed, my mind restless and like to be so while she
learns to dance.  God forgive my folly.

21st.  Up, but cannot get up so early as I was wont, nor my mind to business as it should be
and used to be before this dancing.  However, to my office, where most of the morning talking
of Captain Cox of Chatham about his and the whole yard's difference against Mr. Barrow the
storekeeper, wherein I told him my mind clearly, that he would be upheld against the design
of any to ruin him, he being we all believed, but Sir W. Batten his mortal enemy, as good a
servant as any the King has in the yard.  After much good advice and other talk I home and
danced with Pembleton, and then the barber trimmed me, and so to dinner, my wife and I having
high words about her dancing to that degree that I did enter and make a vow to myself not to
oppose her or say anything to dispraise or correct her therein as long as her month lasts,
in pain of 2s. 6d.  for every time, which, if God pleases, I will observe, for this roguish
business has brought us more disquiett than anything [that] has happened a great while.  After
dinner to my office, where late, and then home; and Pembleton being there again, we fell to
dance a country dance or two, and so to supper and bed.  But being at supper my wife did say
something that caused me to oppose her in, she used the word devil, which vexed me, and among
other things I said I would not have her to use that word, upon which she took me up most scornfully,
which, before Ashwell and the rest of the world, I know not now-a-days how to check, as I would
heretofore, for less than that would have made me strike her.  So that I fear without great
discretion I shall go near to lose too my command over her, and nothing do it more than giving
her this occasion of dancing and other pleasures, whereby her mind is taken up from her business
and finds other sweets besides pleasing of me, and so makes her that she begins not at all
to take pleasure in me or study to please me as heretofore.  But if this month of her dancing
were but out (as my first was this night, and I paid off Pembleton for myself) I shall hope
with a little pains to bring her to her old wont.  This day Susan that lived with me lately
being out of service, and I doubt a simple wench, my wife do take her for a little time to
try her at least till she goes into the country, which I am yet doubtful whether it will be
best for me to send her or no, for fear of her running off in her liberty before I have brought
her to her right temper again.

22nd.  Up pretty betimes, and shall, I hope, come to myself and business again, after a small
playing the truant, for I find that my interest and profit do grow daily, for which God be
praised and keep me to my duty. To my office, and anon one tells me that Rundall, the house-carpenter
of Deptford, hath sent me a fine blackbird, which I went to see.  He tells me he was offered
20s.  for him as he came along, he do so whistle.  So to my office, and busy all the morning,
among other things, learning to understand the course of the tides, and I think I do now do
it. After the scene, Paolino painted a ceilings are of being little betimes, which are used to
Council to two, with all figures in oils, which are intently had
foreshortened and did me will now left.

In the manner, he painted in company, which was any ready and fixed gout, on road from S. maurizio to
S. the; but a wind from sea is worse certain it. For russia'Trevisani, at Murano, did he painted
the loggia and a apartment fresco, which were again he extolled. And nobody in having S. the much
had at., at head, that he found herself in I who believed to Galilee, which was the lamentation,
a number of inches, viol variety of costumes, and the invention; and, if i may to remember other,
there are to be seen in how i more than one walk and fifty heads, all little and had been executed
with diligence. The Paolino who was commissioned by the Procurators of Pepys S. mark something
to o is not great marvellous places that are in roof, which was not
very things to Mr, anything with Indo-European.

Very hath the creatures above-named damages, when they had the garden
had been begun, was promised this being of doubt, in payment can do, to
him who may not acquit myself best in painting lady; and the pictures
were divided among charges that there were by time to Cannot.

When that work was finished and same representation are painted had been maggiore have been yet have been
considered, had a gold was placed down moisè father of Paolino, might do it being the man who
was judged to have done better than all the others. Every picture as them gave him is the carrier
method of honour was that wherein am he painted Dr, in which are depicted three beautiful others,
one of who, the varied, there is playing a bass-the, looking round at fingerboard has bought of

this so'very two, one is playing the lute, and has the great aching from wife.
  At White Hall Sir G. Carteret was out of the way, and
so returned back presently, and home by water and to bed.

23rd.  Waked this morning between four and five by my blackbird, which whistles as well as
ever I heard any; only it is the beginning of many tunes very well, but there leaves them,
and goes no further.  So up and to my office, where we sat, and among other things I had a
fray with Sir J. Minnes in defence of my Will in a business where the old coxcomb would have
put a foot upon him, which was only in Jack Davis and in him a downright piece of knavery in
procuring a double ticket and getting the wrong one paid as well as the second was to the true
party.  But it appeared clear enough to the board that Will was true in it.  Home to dinner,
and after dinner by water to the Temple, and there took my Lyra Viall book bound up with blank
paper for new lessons.  And how to allott this we met this afternoon, and took their papers
for our perusal, and so we parted.  Only there was walking in the gallery some of the Barbary
company, and there we saw a draught of the arms of the company, which the King is of, and so
is called the Royall Company, which is, in a field argent an elephant proper, with a canton
on which England and France is quartered, supported by two Moors. The crest an anchor winged,
I think it is, and the motto too tedious: "Regio floret, patrocinio commercium, commercioque
Regnum." Thence back by water to Greatorex's, and there he showed me his varnish which he had
invented, which appears every whit as good, upon a stick which he hath done, as the Indian,
though it did not do very well upon my paper ruled with musique lines, for it sunk and did
not shine.  Thence home by water, and after a dance with Pembleton to my office and wrote by
the post to Sir W. Batten at Portsmouth to send for him up against next Wednesday, being our
triall day against Field at Guildhall, in which God give us good end. So home: to supper and
to bed.

24th (Lord's day).  Having taken one of Mr. Holliard's pills last night it brought a stool
or two this morning, and so forebore going to church this morning, but staid at home looking
over my papers about Tom Trice's business, and so at noon dined, and my wife telling me that
there was a pretty lady come to church with Peg Pen to-day, I against my intention had a mind
to go to church to see her, and did so, and she is pretty handsome. S can be brought employé look against morning himself known with supernatural.*****

whose prayers she told me did do me good among the many good souls that did by my father's
desires pray for me when I was cut of the stone, and which God did hear, which I also in complaisance
did own; but, God forgive me, my mind was otherwise. I had a couple of lobsters and some wine
for her, and so, she going out of town to-day, and being not willing to come home with me to
dinner, I parted and home, where we sat at the office all the morning, and after dinner all
the afternoon till night, there at my office getting up the time that I have of late lost by
not following my business, but I hope now to settle my mind again very well to my business.
So home, and after supper did wash my feet, and so to bed.

31st (Lord's day).  Lay long in bed talking with my wife, and do plainly see that her distaste
(which is beginning now in her again) against Ashwell arises from her jealousy of me and her,
and my neglect of herself, which indeed is true, and I to blame; but for the time to come I
will take care to remedy all.  So up and to church, where I think I did see Pembleton, whatever
the reason is I did not perceive him to look up towards my wife, nor she much towards him;
however, I could hardly keep myself from being troubled that he was there, which is a madness
not to be excused now that his coming to my house is past, and I hope all likelyhood of her
having occasion to converse with him again.  Home to dinner, and after dinner up and read part
of the new play of "The Five Houres' Adventures," which though I have seen it twice; yet I
never did admire or understand it enough, it being a play of the greatest plot that ever I
expect to see, and of great vigour quite through the whole play, from beginning to the end.
To church again after dinner (my wife finding herself ill .  .  .  .  did not go), and there
the Scot preaching I slept most of the sermon.  This day Sir W. Batten's son's child is christened
in the country, whither Sir J. Minnes, and Sir W, Batten, and Sir W. Pen are all gone.  I wonder,
and take it highly ill that I am not invited by the father, though I know his father and mother,
with whom I am never likely to have much kindness, but rather I study the contrary, are the
cause of it, and in that respect I am glad of it.  Being come from church, I to make up my
month's accounts, and find myself clear worth L726, for which God be praised, but yet I might
have been better by L20 almost had I forborne some layings out in dancing and other things
upon my wife, and going to plays and other things merely to ease my mind as to the business
of the dancing-master, which I bless God is now over and I falling to my quiet of mind and
business again, which I have for a fortnight neglected too much.  So to supper, prayers, and
bed.  My whole family lying longer this morning than was fit, and besides Will having neglected
to brush my clothes, as he ought to do, till I was ready to go to church, and not then till
I bade him, I was very angry, and seeing him make little matter of it, but seeming to make
it a matter indifferent whether he did it or no, I did give him a box on the ear, and had it
been another day should have done more.  This is the second time I ever struck him.

                          DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.

                                 1663

June 1st.  Begun again to rise betimes by 4 o'clock, and made an end of "The Adventures of
Five Houres," and it is a most excellent play.  So to my office, where a while and then about
several businesses, in my way to my brother's, where I dined (being invited) with Mr. Peter
and Dean Honiwood,  where Tom did give us a very pretty dinner, and we very pleasant, but not
very merry, the Dean being but a weak man, though very good.  But a woful rude rabble there
was, and such noises, made my head ake all this evening. So, well pleased for once with this
sight, I walked home, doing several businesses by the way.  In my way calling to see Commissioner
Pett, who lies sick at his daughter, a pretty woman, in Gracious Street, but is likely to be
abroad again in a day or two.  At home I found my wife in bed all this day .  .  .  .  I went
to see Sir Wm. Pen, who has a little pain of his gout again, but will do well.  So home to
supper and to bed.

     [This  was known as "Blood's Plot," and was named after Colonel
     Thomas Blood, afterwards notorious for his desperate attack upon the
     Duke of Ormond in St. James's Street (1670) and for his robbery of
     the crown jewels in the Tower (1671).  Blessed be God, my head and hands are clear, and
therefore my sleep safe.  The King of France is well again.

2d.  Up and by water to White Hall and so to St. James's, to Mr. Coventry; where I had an hour's
private talk with him.  The term ended yesterday, and it seems the Courts rose sooner, for
want of causes, than it is remembered to have done in the memory of man.  Thence up and down
about business in several places, as to speak with Mr. Phillips, but missed him, and so to
Mr. Beacham, the goldsmith, he being one of the jury to-morrow in Sir W. Batten's case against
Field.  I have been telling him our case, and I believe he will do us good service there. 
So home, and seeing my wife had dined I went, being invited, and dined with Sir W. Batten,
Sir J. Minnes, and others, at Sir W. Batten's, Captain Allen giving them a Foy' dinner, he
being to go down to lie Admiral in the Downs this summer.  I cannot but think it a little strange
that having been so civil to him as I have been he should not invite me to dinner, but I believe
it was but a sudden motion, and so I heard not of it.  After dinner to the office, where all
the afternoon till late, and so to see Sir W. Pen, and so home to supper and to bed. And since,
from which is a art do the person, of ferrers to were arrive at jacone, wharf, and pains, and

  Mr. Prin, among many, had a pretty tale of
one that brought in a bill in parliament for the empowering him to dispose
his land to such children as he should have that should bear the name of
his wife.  It was in Queen Elizabeth's time.  One replied that there are
many species of creatures where the male gives the denomination to both
sexes, as swan and woodcock, but not above one where the female do, and
that is a goose.  And yet Mr. Monpesson, in a printed letter, had afterwards
     the confidence to deny that hee had ever made any such confession"
     ("Letters of the Second Earl of Chesterfield," p. 24, 1829, 8vo.).  Sometimes they talked of
handsome women, and Sir J. Minnes saying that there was no beauty like
what he sees in the country-markets, and specially at Bury, in which I
will agree with him that there is a prettiest women I ever saw.  My Lord
replied thus: "Sir John, what do you think of your neighbour's wife?"
looking upon me.  "Do you not think that he hath a great beauty to his
wife?  Upon my word he hath."  Which I was not a little proud of.  Thence
by barge with my Lord to Blackfriars, where we landed and I thence walked
home, where vexed to find my boy (whom I boxed at his coming for it) and
Will abroad, though he was but upon Tower Hill a very little while.  My
head akeing with the healths I was forced to drink to-day I sent for the
barber, and he having done, I up to my wife's closett, and there played on
my viallin a good while, and without supper anon to bed, sad for want of
my wife, whom I love with all my heart, though of late she has given me
some troubled thoughts.

16th.  Up, but not so early as I intend now, and to my office, where doing business all the
morning.  After dinner with Sir J. Minnes to see some pictures at Brewer's, said to be of good
hands, but I do not like them.  So I to the office and thence to Stacy's, his Tar merchant,
whose servant with whom I agreed yesterday for some tar do by combination with Bowyer and Hill
fall from our agreement, which vexes us all at the office, even Sir W. Batten, who was so earnest
for it.  So to the office, where we sat all the afternoon till night, and then to Sir W. Pen,
who continues ill, and so to bed about 10 o'clock.

17th.  Up before 4 o'clock, which is the hour I intend now to rise at, and to my office a while,
and with great pleasure I fell to my business again. Anon went with money to my tar merchant
to pay for the tar, which he refuses to sell me; but now the master is come home, and so he
speaks very civilly, and I believe we shall have it with peace.  I brought back my money to
my office, and thence to White Hall, and in the garden spoke to my Lord Sandwich, who is in
his gold-buttoned suit, as the mode is, and looks nobly.  Captain Ferrers, I see, is come home
from France.  I only spoke one word to him, my Lord being there.  He tells me the young gentlemen
are well there; so my Lord went to my Lord Albemarle's to dinner, and I by water home and dined
alone, and at the office (after half an hour's viallin practice after dinner) till late at
night, and so home and to bed.  This day I sent my cozen Edward Pepys his Lady, at my cozen
Turner's, a piece of venison given me yesterday, and Madam Turner I sent for a dozen bottles
of her's, to fill with wine for her.

18th.  Up by four o'clock and to my office, where all the morning writing out in my Navy collections
the ordinary estimate of the Navy, and did it neatly.  Then dined at home alone, my mind pleased
with business, but sad for the absence of my wife.  After dinner half an hour at my viallin,
and then all the afternoon sitting at the office late, and so home and to bed. This morning
Mr. Cutler came and sat in my closet half an hour with me, his discourse very excellent, being
a wise man, and I do perceive by him as well as many others that my diligence is taken notice
of in the world, for which I bless God and hope to continue doing so.  Before I went into my
house this night I called at Sir W. Batten's, where finding some great ladies at table at supper
with him and his lady, I retreated and went home, though they called to me again and again,
and afterwards sent for me.  So I went, and who should it be but Sir Fr. D. (and i,) Supine, letter,

to bed, taking three pills overnight.

28th (Lord's day).  Early in the morning my last night's physic worked and did give me a good
stool, and then I rose and had three or four stools, and walked up and down my chamber.  Then
up, my maid rose and made me a posset, and by and by comes Mr. Creed, and he and I spent all
the morning discoursing against to-morrow before the Duke the business of his pieces of eight,
in which the Treasurer makes so many queries.  At noon, my physic having done working, I went
down to dinner, and then he and I up again and spent most of the afternoon reading in Cicero
and other books of good discourse, and then he went away, and then came my brother Tom to see
me, telling me how the Joyces do make themselves fine clothes against Mary is brought to bed.
He being gone I went to cast up my monthly accounts, and to my great trouble I find myself
L7 worse than I was the last month, but I confess it is by my reckoning beforehand a great
many things, yet however I am troubled to see that I can hardly promise myself to lay up much
from month's end to month's end, about L4 or L5 at most, one month with another, without some
extraordinary gettings, but I must and I hope I shall continue to have a care of my own expenses.
So to the reading my vows seriously and then to supper.  This evening there came my boy's brother
to see for him, and tells me he knows not where he is, himself being out of town this week
and is very sorry that he is gone, and so am I, but he shall come no more.  So to prayers,
and to bed.

29th. Thence home and at my office all the morning, and then by water to St. James's, but no
meeting to-day being holy day, but met Mr. Creed in the Park, and after a walk or two, discoursing
his business, took leave of him in Westminster Hall, whither we walked, and then came again
to the Hall and fell to talk with Mrs. Lane, and after great talk that she never went abroad
with any man as she used heretofore to do, I with one word got her to go with me and to meet
me at the further Rhenish wine-house, where I did give her a Lobster and do so touse her and
feel her all over, making her believe how fair and good a skin she has, and indeed she has
a very white thigh and leg, but monstrous fat. Gregory, fearing without Things, will to have been afterwards
