Matters thus dragged on, till the space before the Christmas holidays was reckoned by weeks,
instead of months, and as Mrs. Frederick Langford laughingly said, she should be fairly ashamed
to meet her boy again at their present home. She therefore easily allowed herself to be persuaded
to accept Mr. Langford's invitation to take up her quarters at the Hall, and look about her
a little before finally deciding upon the Pleasance. Christmas at Knight Sutton Hall had the
greatest charms in the eyes of Henrietta and Frederick; for many a time had they listened to
the descriptions given con amore by Beatrice Langford, to whom that place had ever been a home,
perhaps the more beloved, because the other half of her life was spent in London.

It was a great disappointment, however, to hear that Mrs. Geoffrey Langford was likely to be
detained in London by the state of health of her aunt, Lady Susan St. Leger, whom she did not
like to leave, while no other of the family was at hand. This was a cruel stroke, but she could
not bear that her husband should miss his yearly holiday, her daughter lose the pleasure of
a fortnight with Henrietta, or Mr. and Mrs. Langford be deprived of the visit of their favourite
son: and she therefore arranged to go and stay with Lady Susan, while Beatrice and her father
went as usual to Knight Sutton.

Mr. Geoffrey Langford offered to escort his sister-in-law from Devonshire, but she did not
like his holidays to be so wasted. She had no merely personal apprehensions, and new as railroads
were to her, declared herself perfectly willing and able to manage with no companions but her
daughter and maid, with whom she was to travel to his house in London, there to be met in a
day or two by the two school-boys, Frederick and his cousin Alexander, and then proceed all
together to Knight Sutton.

Henrietta could scarcely believe that the long-wished-for time was really come, packing up
actually commencing, and that her waking would find her under a different roof from that which
she had never left. She did not know till now that she had any attachments to the place she
had hitherto believed utterly devoid of all interest; but she found she could not bid it farewell
without sorrow. There was the old boatman with his rough kindly courtesy, and his droll ways
of speaking; there was the rocky beach where she and her brother had often played on the verge
of the ocean, watching with mysterious awe or sportive delight the ripple of the advancing
waves, the glorious sea itself, the walks, the woods, streams, and rocks, which she now believed,
as mamma and Uncle Geoffrey had often told her, were more beautiful than anything she was likely
to find in Sussex. Other scenes there were, connected with her grandmother, which she grieved
much at parting with, but she shunned talking over her regrets, lest she should agitate her
mother, whom she watched with great anxiety.

She was glad that so much business was on her hands, as to leave little time for dwelling on
her feelings, to which she attributed the calm quietness with which she went through the few
trying days that immediately preceded their departure. Henrietta felt this constant employment
so great a relief to her own spirits, that she was sorry on her own account, as well as her
mother's, when every possible order had been given, every box packed, and nothing was to be
done, but to sit opposite to each other, on each side of the fire, in the idleness which precedes
candle-light. Her mother leant back in silence, and she watched her with an anxious gaze. She
feared to say anything of sympathy with what she supposed her feeling, lest she should make
her weep. An indifferent speech would be out of place even if Henrietta herself could have
made it, and yet to remain silent was to allow melancholy thoughts to prey upon her. So thought
the daughter, longing at the same time that her persuasions were all unsaid.

"Come here, my dear child," said her mother presently, and Henrietta almost started at the
calmness of the voice, and the serenity of the tranquil countenance. She crossed to her mother,
and sat down on a low footstool, leaning against her. "You are very much afraid for me," continued
Mrs. Langford, as she remarked upon the anxious expression of her face, far different from
her own, "but you need not fear, it is all well with me; it would be wrong not to be thankful
for those who are not really lost to me as well as for those who were given to me here."

All Henrietta's consideration for her mother could not prevent her from bursting into tears.
"O mamma, I did not know it would be so like going away from dear grandmamma."

"Try to feel the truth, my dear, that our being near to her depends on whether we are in our
duty or not."

"Yes, yes, but this place is so full of her! I do so love it! I did not know it till now!"

"Yes, we must always love it, my dear child; but we are going to our home, Henrietta, to your
father's home in life and death, and it must be good for us to be there. With your grandfather,
who has wished for us. Knight Sutton is our true home, the one where it is right for us to be."

Henrietta still wept bitterly, and strange it was that it should be she who stood in need of
consolation, for the fulfilment of her own most ardent wish, and from the very person to whom
it was the greatest trial. It was not, however, self-reproach that caused her tears, that her
mother's calmness prevented her from feeling, but only attachment to the place she was about
to leave, and the recollections, which she accused herself of having slighted. Her mother,
who had made up her mind to do what was right, found strength and peace at the moment of trial,
when the wayward and untrained spirits of the daughter gave way. Not that she blamed Henrietta,
she was rather gratified to find that she was so much attached to her home and her grandmother,
and felt so much with her; and after she had succeeded in some degree in restoring her to composure,
they talked long and earnestly over old times and deeper feelings.

CHAPTER IV.

The journey to London was prosperously performed, and Mrs. Frederick Langford was not overfatigued
when she arrived at Uncle Geoffrey's house at Westminster. The cordiality of their greeting
may be imagined, as a visit from Henrietta had been one of the favourite visions of her cousin
Beatrice, through her whole life; and the two girls were soon deep in the delights of a conversation
in which sense and nonsense had an equal share.

The next day was spent by the two Mrs. Langfords in quiet together, while Henrietta was conducted
through a rapid whirl of sight-seeing by Beatrice and Uncle Geoffrey, the latter of whom, to
his niece's great amazement, professed to find almost as much novelty in the sights as she
did. A short December day, though not what they would have chosen, had this advantage, that
the victim could not be as completely fagged and worn out as in a summer's day, and Henrietta
was still fresh and in high spirits when they drove home and found to their delight that the
two schoolboys had already arrived.

Beatrice met both alike as old friends and almost brothers, but Alexander, though returning
her greeting with equal cordiality, looked shyly at the new aunt and cousin, and as Henrietta
suspected, wished them elsewhere. She had heard much of him from Beatrice, and knew that her
brother regarded him as a formidable rival; and she was therefore surprised to see that his
broad honest face expressed more good humour than intellect, and his manners wanted polish.
He was tolerably well-featured, with light eyes and dark hair, and though half a year older
than his cousin, was much shorter, more perhaps in appearance than reality, from the breadth
and squareness of his shoulders, and from not carrying himself well.

Alexander was, as ought previously to have been recorded, the third son of Mr. Roger Langford,
the heir of Knight Sutton, at present living at Sutton Leigh, a small house on his father's
estate, busied with farming, sporting, and parish business; while his active wife contrived
to make a narrow income feed, clothe, and at least half educate their endless tribe of boys.
Roger, the eldest, was at sea; Frederick, the second, in India; and Alexander owed his more
learned education to Uncle Geoffrey, who had been well recompensed by his industry and good
conduct. Indeed his attainments had always been so superior to those of his brothers, that
he might have been considered as a prodigy, had not his cousin Frederick been always one step
before him.

Fred had greater talent, and had been much better taught at home, so that on first going to
school, he took and kept the higher place; but this was but a small advantage in his eyes,
compared with what he had to endure out of school during his first half-year. Unused to any
training or companionship save of womankind, he was disconsolate, bewildered, derided in that
new rude world; while Alex, accustomed to fight his way among rude brothers, instantly found
his level, and even extended a protecting hand to his cousin, who requited it with little gratitude.
Soon overcoming his effeminate habits, he grew expert and dexterous, and was equal to Alex
in all but main bodily strength; but the spirit of rivalry once excited, had never died away,
and with a real friendship and esteem for each other, their names or rather their nicknames
had almost become party words among their schoolfellows.

Nor was it probable that this competition would be forgotten on this first occasion of spending
their holidays together. Fred felt himself open to that most galling accusation of want of
manliness, on account at once of his ignorance of country sports, and of his knowledge of accomplishments;
but he did not guess at the feeling which made Alexander on his side regard those very accomplishments
with a feeling which, if it were not jealousy, was at least very nearly akin to it.

Beatrice Langford had not the slightest claim to beauty. She was very little, and so thin that
her papa did her no injustice when he called her skin and bones; but her thin brown face, with
the aid of a pair of very large deep Italian-looking eyes, was so full of brilliant expression,
and showed such changes of feeling from sad to gay, from sublime to ridiculous, that no one
could have wished one feature otherwise. And if instead of being "like the diamond bright,"
they had been "dull as lead," it would have been little matter to Alex. Beatrice had been,
she was still, his friend, his own cousin, more than what he could believe a sister to be if
he had one,--in short his own little Queen Bee. He had had a monopoly of her; she had trained
him in all the civilization which he possessed, and it was with considerable mortification
that he thought himself lowered in her eyes by comparison with his old rival, as old a friend
of hers, with the same claim to cousinly affection; and instead of understanding only what
she had taught him, familiar with the tastes and pursuits on which she set perhaps too great
a value.

Fred did not care nearly as much for Beatrice's preference: it might be that he took it as
a matter of course, or perhaps that having a sister of his own, he did not need her sympathy,
but still it was a point on which he was likely to be sensitive, and thus her favour was likely
to be secretly quite as much a matter of competition as their school studies and pastimes.

For instance, dinner was over, and Henrietta was admiring some choice books of prints, such
luxuries as Uncle Geoffrey now afforded himself, and which his wife and daughter greatly preferred
to the more costly style of living which some people thought befitted them. She called to her
brother who was standing by the fire, "Fred, do come and look at this beautiful Albert Durer
of Sintram."

He hesitated, doubting whether Alexander would scorn him for an acquaintance with Albert Durer,
but Beatrice added, "Yes, it was an old promise that I would show it to you. There now, look,
admire, or be pronounced insensible."

"A wonderful old fellow was that Albert," said Fred, looking, and forgetting his foolish false
shame in the pleasure of admiration. "Yes; O how wondrously the expression on Death's face
changes as it does in the story! How easy it is to see how Fouque must have built it up! Have
you seen it, mamma?"

His mother came to admire. Another print was produced, and another, and Fred and Beatrice were
eagerly studying the elaborate engravings of the old German, when Alex, annoyed at finding
her too much engrossed to have a word for him, came to share their occupation, and took up
one of the prints with no practised hand. "Take care, Alex, take care," cried Beatrice, in
a sort of excruciated tone; "don't you see what a pinch you are giving it! Only the initiated
ought to handle a print: there is a pattern for you," pointing to Fred.

She cut right and left: both looked annoyed, and retreated from the table. Fred thinking how
Alex must look down on fingers which possessed any tenderness; Alex provoked at once and pained.
Queen Bee's black eyes perceived their power, and gave a flash of laughing triumph.

But Beatrice was not quite in her usual high spirits, for she was very sorry to leave her mother;
and when they went up stairs for the night, she stood long over the fire talking to her, and
listening to certain parting cautions.

"How I wish you could have come, mamma! I am so sure that grandmamma in her kindness will tease
Aunt Mary to death. You are the only person who can guard her without affronting grandmamma.
Now I--"

"Had better let it alone," rejoined Mrs. Geoffrey Langford. "You will do more harm than by
letting things take their course. Remember, too, that Aunt Mary was at home there long before
you or I knew the place."

"Oh, if that tiresome Aunt Amelia would but have had some consideration! To go out of town
and leave Aunt Susan on our hands just when we always go home!"

"We have lamented that often enough," said her mother smiling. "It is unlucky, but it cannot
be too often repeated, that wills and wishes must sometimes bend."

"You say that for me, mamma," said Beatrice. "You think grandmamma and I have too much will
for each other."

"If you are conscious of that, Bee, I hope that you will bend that wilful will of yours."

"I hope I shall," said Beatrice, "but.... Well, I must go to bed. Good night, mamma."

And Mrs. Geoffrey Langford looked after her daughter anxiously, but she well knew that Beatrice
knew her besetting fault, and she trusted to the many fervent resolutions she had made against it.

The next morning the party bade adieu to Mrs. Geoffrey Langford, and set out on their journey
to Knight Sutton. They filled a whole railroad carriage, and were a very cheerful party. Alexander
and Beatrice sat opposite to each other, talking over Knight Sutton delights with animation,
Beatrice ever and anon turning to her other cousins with explanations, or referring to her
papa, who was reading the newspaper and talking with Mrs. Frederick Langford.

The day was not long enough for all the talk of the cousins, and the early winter twilight
came on before their conversation was exhausted, or they had reached the Allonfield station.

"Here we are!" exclaimed Beatrice, as the train stopped, and at the same moment a loud voice
called out, "All right! where are you, Alex?" upon which Alexander tumbled across Henrietta
to feel for the handle of the carriage-door, replying, "Here, old fellow, let us out. Have
you brought Dumpling?" And Uncle Geoffrey and Beatrice exclaimed, "How d'ye do, Carey?"

When Alexander had succeeded in making his exit, Henrietta beheld him shaking hands with a
figure not quite his own height, and in its rough great-coat not unlike a small species of
bear. Uncle Geoffrey and Fred handed out the ladies, and sought their appurtenances in the
dark, and Henrietta began to give Alex credit for a portion of that which maketh man, when
he shoved his brother, admonishing him that there was Aunt Mary, upon which Carey advanced,
much encumbered with sheepish shyness, presented a great rough driving-glove, and shortly and
bluntly replied to the soft tones which kindly greeted him, and inquired for all at home.

"Is the Hall carriage come?" asked Alex, and, receiving a gruff affirmative, added, "then,
Aunt Mary, you had better come to it while Uncle Geoffrey looks after the luggage," offered
his arm with tolerable courtesy, and conducted her to the carriage. "There," said he, "Carey
has driven in our gig, and I suppose Fred and I had better go back with him."

"Is the horse steady?" asked his aunt, anxiously.

"Dumple? To be sure! Never does wrong! do you, old fellow?" said Alex, patting his old friend.

"And no lamps?"

"O, we know the way blindfold, and you might cross Sutton Heath a dozen times without meeting
anything but a wheelbarrow-full of peat."

"And how is the road now? It used to be very bad in my time."

"Lots of ruts," muttered Carey to his brother, who interpreted it, "A few ruts this winter,
but Dumpling knows all the bad places."

By this time Uncle Geoffrey came up, and instantly perceiving the state of things, said, "I
say, Freddy, do you mind changing places with me? I should like to have a peep at Uncle Roger
before going up to the house, and then Dumpling's feelings won't be hurt by passing the turn
to Sutton Leigh."

Fred could not object, and his mother rejoiced in the belief that Uncle Geoffrey would take
the reins, nor did Beatrice undeceive her, though, as the vehicle rattled past the carriage
at full speed, she saw Alexander's own flourish of the whip, and knew that her papa was letting
the boys have their own way. She had been rather depressed in the morning on leaving her mother,
but as she came nearer home her spirits mounted, and she was almost wild with glee. "Aunt Mary,
do you know where you are?"

"On Sutton Heath, I presume, from the absence of landmarks."

"Yes, that we are. You dear old place, how d'ye do? You beginning of home! I don't know when
it is best coming to you: on a summer's evening, all glowing with purple heath, or a frosty
star-light night like this. There is the Sutton Leigh turn! Hurrah! only a mile further to
the gate."

"Where I used to go to meet the boys coming home from school," said her aunt, in a low tone
of deep feeling. But she would not sadden their blithe young hearts, and added cheerfully,
"Just the same as ever, I see: how well I know the outline of the bank there!"

"Ay, it is your fatherland, too, Aunt Mary! Is there not something inspiring in the very air?
Come, Fred, can't you get up a little enthusiasm?"

"Oceans, without getting it up," replied Fred. "I never was more rejoiced in my whole life,"
and he began to hum Domum.

"Sing it, sing it; let us join in chorus as homage to Knight Sutton," cried Henrietta.

And the voices began, "Domum, Domum, dulce Domum;" even Aunt Mary herself caught the feelings
of her young companions, felt herself coming to her own beloved home and parents, half forgot
how changed was her situation, and threw herself into the delight of returning.

"Now, Fred," said Henrietta, "let us try those verses that you found a tune for, that begin
'What is home?'"

This also was sung, and by the time it was finished they had reached a gate leading into a
long drive through dark beech woods. "This is the beautiful wood of which I have often told
you, Henrietta," said Mrs. Frederick Langford.

"The wood with glades like cathedral aisles," said Henrietta. "O, how delightful it will be
to see it come out in leaf!"

"Which I have never seen," said Beatrice. "I tell papa he has made his fortune, and ought to
retire, and he says he is too young for it."

"In which I fully agree with him," said her aunt. "I should not like to see him with nothing
to do."

"O, mamma, Uncle Geoffrey would never be anywhere with nothing to do," said Henrietta.

"No," said her mother, "but people are always happier with work made for them, than with what
they make for themselves. Besides, Uncle Geoffrey has too much talent to be spared."

"Ay," said Fred, "I wondered to hear you so devoid of ambition, little Busy Bee."

"It is only Knight Sutton and thinking of May flowers that makes me so," said Beatrice. "I
believe after all, I should break my heart if papa did retire without--"

"Without what, Bee?"

"Being Lord Chancellor, I suppose," said Henrietta very seriously. "I am sure I should."

"His being in Parliament will content me for the present," said Beatrice, "for I have been
told too often that high principles don't rise in the world, to expect any more. We can be
just as proud of him as if he was."

"You are in a wondrously humble and philosophic mood, Queen Bee," said Henrietta; "but where
are we now?" added she, as a gate swung back.

"Coming into the paddock," said Beatrice; "don't you see the lights in the house? There, that
is the drawing-room window to the right, and that large one the great hall window. Then upstairs,
don't you see that red fire-light? That is the south room, which Aunt Mary will be sure to have."

Henrietta did not answer, for there was something that subdued her in the nervous pressure
of her mother's hand. The carriage stopped at the door, whence streamed forth light, dazzling
to eyes long accustomed to darkness; but in the midst stood a figure which Henrietta could
not but have recognized in an instant, even had not old Mr. Langford paid more than one visit
to Rocksand. Tall, thin, unbent, with high bald forehead, clear eye, and long snowy hair; there
he was, lifting rather than handing his daughter-in-law from the carriage, and fondly kissing
her brow; then he hastily greeted the other occupants of the carriage, while she received the
kiss of Mrs. Langford.

They were now in the hall, and turning again to his daughter-in-law, he gave her his arm, and
led her into the drawing-room, where he once more embraced her, saying, "Bless you, my own
dear Mary!" She clung to him for a moment as if she longed to weep with him, but recovering
herself in an instant, she gave her attention to Mrs. Langford, who was trying to administer
to her comfort with a degree of bustle and activity which suited well with the alertness of
her small figure and the vivacity of the black eyes which still preserved their brightness,
though her hair was perfectly white. "Well, Mary, my dear, I hope you are not tired. You had
better sit down and take off your furs, or will you go to your room? But where is Geoffrey?"

"He went with Alex and Carey, round by Sutton Leigh," said Beatrice.

"Ha! ha! my little Queen, are you there?" said grandpapa, holding out his arms to her. "And,"
added he, "is not this your first introduction to the twins, grandmamma? Why you are grown
as fine a pair as I would wish to see on a summer's day. Last time I saw you I could hardly
tell you apart, when you both wore straw hats and white trousers. No mistake now though. Well,
I am right glad to have you here."

"Won't you take off some of your wraps, Mary?" proceeded Mrs. Langford, and her daughter-in-law,
with a soft "Thank you," passively obeyed. "And you too, my dear," she added to Henrietta.

"Off with that bonnet, Miss Henrietta," proceeded grandpapa. "Let me see whether you are as
like your brother as ever. He has your own face, Mary."

"Do not you think his forehead like--" and she looked to the end of the room where hung the
portraits of two young children, the brothers Geoffrey and Frederick. Henrietta had often longed
to see it, but now she could attend to nothing but her mamma.

"Like poor dear Frederick?" said grandmamma. "Well, I can't judge by firelight, you know, my
dear, but I should say they were both your very image."

"You can't be the image of any one I should like better," said Mr. Langford, turning to them
cheerfully, and taking Henrietta's hand. "I wish nothing better than to find you the image
of your mamma inside and out."

"Ah, there's Geoffrey!" cried Mrs. Langford, springing up and almost running to meet him.

"Well, Geoffrey, how d'ye do?" added his father with an indescribable tone and look of heartfelt
delight. "Left all your cares behind you?"

"Left my wife behind me," said Uncle Geoffrey, making a rueful face.

"Ay, it is a sad business that poor Beatrice cannot come," said both the old people, "but how
is poor Lady Susan?"

"As usual, only too nervous to be left with none of the family at hand. Well, Mary, you look
tired."

Overcome, Uncle Geoffrey would have said, but he thought the other accusation would answer
the same purpose and attract less attention, and it succeeded, for Mrs. Langford proposed to
take her up stairs. Henrietta thought that Beatrice would have offered to save her the trouble,
but this would not have been at all according to the habits of grandmamma or granddaughter,
and Mrs. Langford briskly led the way to a large cheerful-looking room, talking all the time
and saying she supposed Henrietta would like to be with her mamma. She nodded to their maid,
who was waiting there, and gave her a kindly greeting, stirred the already bright fire into
a blaze, and returning to her daughter-in-law who was standing like one in a dream, she gave
her a fond kiss, saying, "There, Mary, I thought you would like to be here."

"Thank you, thank you, you are always kind."

"There now, Mary, don't let yourself be overcome. You would not bring him back again, I know.
Come, lie down and rest. There--that is right--and don't think of coming down stairs. You think
your mamma had better not, don't you?"

"Much better not, thank you, grandmamma," said Henrietta, as she assisted in settling her mother
on the sofa. "She is tired and overcome now, but she will be herself after a rest."

"And ask for anything you like, my dear. A glass of wine or a cup of coffee; Judith will get
you one in a moment. Won't you have a cup of coffee, Mary, my dear?"

"Thank you, no thank you," said Mrs. Frederick Langford, raising herself. "Indeed I am sorry--it
is very foolish." Here the choking sob came again, and she was forced to lie down. Grandmamma
stood by, warming a shawl to throw over her, and pitying her in audible whispers. "Poor thing,
poor thing! it is very sad for her. There! a pillow, my dear? I'll fetch one out of my room.
No? Is her head high enough? Some sal-volatile? Yes, Mary, would you not like some sal-volatile?"

And away she went in search of it, while Henrietta, excessively distressed, knelt by her mother,
who, throwing her arms round her neck, wept freely for some moments, then laid her head on
the cushions again, saying, "I did not think I was so weak!"

"Dearest mamma," said Henrietta, kissing her and feeling very guilty.

"If I have not distressed grandmamma!" said her mother anxiously. "No, never mind me, my dear,
it was fatigue and--"

Still she could not finish, so painfully did the familiar voices, the unchanged furniture,
recall both her happy childhood and the bridal days when she had last entered the house, that
it seemed as it were a new thing, a fresh shock to miss the tone that was never to be heard
there again. Why should all around be the same, when all within was altered? But it had been
only the first few moments that had overwhelmed her, and the sound of Mrs. Langford's returning
footsteps recalled her habit of self-control; she thanked her, held out her quivering hand,
drank the sal-volatile, pronounced herself much better, and asked pardon for having given so
much trouble.

"Trouble? my dear child, no such thing! I only wish I could see you better. No doubt it is
too much for you, this coming home the first time; but then you know poor Fred is gone to a
better--Ah! well, I see you can't bear to speak of him, and perhaps after all quiet is the
best thing. Don't let your mamma think of dressing and coming down, my dear."

There was a little combat on this point, but it ended in Mrs. Frederick Langford yielding,
and agreeing to remain upstairs. Grandmamma would have waited to propose to her each of the
dishes that were to appear at table, and hear which she thought would suit her taste; but very
fortunately, as Henrietta thought, a bell rang at that moment, which she pronounced to be "the
half-hour bell," and she hastened away, telling her granddaughter that dinner would be ready
at half-past five, and calling the maid outside the door to giver her full directions where
to procure anything that her mistress might want.

"Dear grandmamma! just like herself!" said Mrs. Frederick Langford. "But Henrietta, my dear,"
she added with some alarm, "make haste and dress: you must never be too late in this house!"

Henrietta was not much accustomed to dress to a moment, and she was too anxious about her mamma
to make speed with her whole will, and her hair was in no state of forwardness when the dinner-bell
rang, causing her mamma to start and hasten her with an eager, almost alarmed manner. "You
don't know how your grandmamma dislikes being kept waiting," said she.

At last she was ready, and running down, found all the rest assembled, evidently waiting for
her. Frederick, looking anxious, met her at the door to receive her assurances that their mother
was better; the rest inquired, and her apologies were cut short by grandmamma calling them
to eat her turkey before it grew cold. The spirits of all the party were perhaps damped by
Mrs. Frederick Langford's absence and its cause, for the dinner was not a very lively one,
nor the conversation very amusing to Henrietta and Frederick, as it was chiefly on the news
of the country neighbourhood, in which Uncle Geoffrey showed much interest.

As soon as she was released from the dining-room, Henrietta ran up to her mamma, whom she found
refreshed and composed. "But, O mamma, is this a good thing for you?" said Henrietta, looking
at the red case containing her father's miniature, which had evidently been only just closed
on her entrance.

"The very best thing for me, dearest," was the answer, now given in her own calm tones. "It
does truly make me happier than anything else. No, don't look doubtful, my Henrietta; if it
were repining it might hurt me, but I trust it is not."

"And does this really comfort you, mamma?" said Henrietta, as she pressed the spring, and gazed
thoughtfully on the portrait. "O, I cannot fancy that! the more I think, the more I try to
realize what it might have been, think what Uncle Geoffrey is to Beatrice, till sometimes,
O mamma, I feel quite rebellious!"

"You will be better disciplined in time, my poor child," said her mother, sadly. "As your grandmamma
said, who could be so selfish as to wish him here?"

"And can you bear to say so, mamma?"

She clasped her hands and looked up, and Henrietta feared she had gone too far. Both were silent
for some little time, until at last the daughter timidly asked, "And was this your old room,
mamma?"

"Yes: look in that shelf in the corner; there are all our old childish books. Bring that one,"
she added, as Henrietta took one out, and opening it, she showed in the fly-leaf the well-written
"F.H. Langford," with the giver's name; and below in round hand, scrawled all over the page,
"Mary Vivian, the gift of her cousin Fred." "I believe that you may find that in almost all
of them," said she. "I am glad they have been spared from the children at Sutton Leigh. Will
you bring me a few more to look over, before you go down again to grandmamma?"

Henrietta did not like to leave her, and lingered while she made a selection for her among
the books, and from that fell into another talk, in which they were interrupted by a knock
at the door, and the entrance of Mrs. Langford herself. She sat a little time, and asked of
health, strength, and diet, until she bustled off again to see if there was a good fire in
Geoffrey's room, telling Henrietta that tea would soon be ready.

Henrietta's ideas of grandmammas were formed on the placid Mrs. Vivian, naturally rather indolent,
and latterly very infirm, although considerably younger than Mrs. Langford; and she stood looking
after in speechless amazement, her mamma laughing at her wonder. "But, my dear child," she
said, "I beg you will go down. It will never do to have you staying up here all the evening."

Henrietta was really going this time, when as she opened the door, she was stopped by a new
visitor. This was an elderly respectable-looking maid-servant, old Judith, whose name was well
known to her. She had been nursery-maid at Knight Sutton at the time "Miss Mary" arrived from
India, and was now, what in a more modernized family would have been called ladies'-maid or
housekeeper, but here was a nondescript office, if anything, upper housemaid. How she was loved
and respected is known to all who are happy enough to possess a "Judith."

"I beg your pardon, miss," said she, as Henrietta opened the door just before her, and Mrs.
Frederick Langford, on hearing her voice, called out, "O Judith! is that you? I was in hopes
you were coming to see me."

She advanced with a courtesy, at the same time affectionately taking the thin white hand stretched
out to her. "I hope you are better, ma'am. It is something like old times to have you here again."

"Indeed I am very glad to be here, Judith," was the answer, "and very glad to see you looking
like your own dear self."

"Ah! Miss Mary; I beg your pardon, ma'am; I wish I could see you looking better."

"I shall, I hope, to-morrow, thank you, Judith. But you have not been introduced to Henrietta,
there."

"But I have often heard of you, Judith," said Henrietta, cordially holding out her hand. Judith
took it, and looked at her with affectionate earnestness. "Sure enough, miss," said she, "as
Missus says, you are the very picture of your mamma when she went away; but I think I see a
look of poor Master Frederick too."

"Have you seen my brother, Judith?" asked Henrietta, fearing a second discussion on likenesses.

"Yes, Miss Henrietta; I was coming down from Missus's room, when Mr. Geoffrey stopped me to
ask how I did, and he said 'Here's a new acquaintance for you, Judith,' and there was Master
Frederick. I should have known him anywhere, and he spoke so cheerful and pleasant. A fine
young gentleman he is, to be sure."

"Why, we must be like your grandchildren!" said Henrietta; "but O! here comes Fred."

And Judith discreetly retreated as Fred entered bearing a summons to his sister to come down
to tea, saying that he could scarcely prevail on grandmamma to let him take the message instead
of coming herself.

They found Queen Bee perched upon the arm of her grandpapa's chair, with one hand holding by
his collar. She had been coaxing him to say Henrietta was the prettiest girl he ever saw, and
he was teasing her by declaring he should never see anything like Aunt Mary in her girlish
days. Then he called up Henrietta and Fred, and asked them about their home doings, showing
so distinct a knowledge of them, that they laughed and stood amazed. "Ah," said grandpapa,
"you forgot that I had a Queen Bee to enlighten me. We have plenty to tell each other, when
we go buzzing over the ploughed fields together on a sunny morning, haven't we, Busy, Busy Bee?"

Here grandmamma summoned them all to tea. She liked every one to sit round the table, and put
away work and book, as for a regular meal, and it was rather a long one. Then, when all was
over, grandpapa called out, "Come, young ladies, I've been wearying for a tune these three
months. I hope you are not too tired to give us one."

"O no, no, grandpapa!" cried Beatrice, "but you must hear Henrietta. It is a great shame of
her to play so much better than I do, with all my London masters too."

And in music the greater part of the evening was passed away. Beatrice came to her aunt's room
to wish her good-night, and to hear Henrietta's opinions, which were of great delight, and
still greater wonder--grandmamma so excessively kind, and grandpapa, O, he was a grandpapa
to be proud of!

CHAPTER V.

It was an agreeable surprise to Henrietta that her mother waked free from headache, very cheerful,
and feeling quite able to get up to breakfast. The room looked very bright and pleasant by
the first morning light that shone upon the intricate frost-work on the window; and Henrietta,
as usual, was too much lost in gazing at the branches of the elms and the last year's rooks'
nests, to make the most of her time; so that the bell for prayers rang long before she was
ready. Her mamma would not leave her, and remained to help her. Just as they were going down
at last, they met Mrs. Langford on her way up with inquiries for poor Mary. She would have
almost been better pleased with a slight indisposition than with dawdling; but she kindly accepted
Henrietta's apologies, and there was one exclamation of joy from all the assembled party at
Mrs. Frederick Langford's unhoped-for entrance.

"Geoffrey, my dear," began Mrs. Langford, as soon as the greetings and congratulations were
over, "will you see what is the matter with the lock of this tea-chest?--it has been out of
order these three weeks, and I thought you could set it to rights."

While Uncle Geoffrey was pronouncing on its complaints, Atkins, the old servant, put in his head.

"If you please, sir, Thomas Parker would be glad to speak to Mr. Geoffrey about his son on
the railway."

Away went Mr. Geoffrey to the lower regions, where Thomas Parker awaited him, and as soon as
he returned was addressed by his father: "Geoffrey, I put those papers on the table in the
study, if you will look over them when you have time, and tell me what you think of the turnpike
trust."

A few moments after the door was thrown wide open, and in burst three boys, shouting with one
voice--"Uncle Geoffrey, Uncle Geoffrey, you must come and see which of Vixen's puppies are
to be saved!"

"Hush, hush, you rogues, hush!" was Uncle Geoffrey's answer; "don't you know that you are come
into civilized society? Aunt Mary never saw such wild men of the woods."

"All crazy at the sight of Uncle Geoffrey," said grandmamma. "Ah, he spoils you all! but, come
here, Johnny, come and speak to your aunt. There, this is Johnny, and here are Richard and
Willie," she added, as they came up and awkwardly gave their hands to their aunt and cousins.

Henrietta was almost bewildered by seeing so many likenesses of Alexander. "How shall I ever
know them apart?" said she to Beatrice.

"Like grandmamma's nest of teacups, all alike, only each one size below another," said Beatrice.
"However, I don't require you to learn them all at once; only to know Alex and Willie from
the rest. Here, Willie, have you nothing to say to me? How are the rabbits?"

Willie, a nice-looking boy of nine or ten years old, of rather slighter make than his brothers,
and with darker eyes and hair, came to Queen Bee's side, as if he was very glad to see her,
and only slightly discomposed by Henrietta's neighbourhood.

John gave the information that papa and Alex were only just behind, and in another minute they
made their appearance. "Good morning sir; good morning, ma'am," were Uncle Roger's greetings,
as he came in. "Ah, Mary, how d'ye do? glad to see you here at last; hope you are better.---Ah,
good morning, good morning," as he quickly shook hands with the younger ones. "Good morning,
Geoffrey; I told Martin to take the new drill into the outfield, for I want your opinion whether
it is worth keeping."

And thereupon the three gentlemen began a learned discussion on drills, during which Henrietta
studied her uncle. She was at first surprised to see him look so young--younger, she thought,
than Uncle Geoffrey; but in a moment or two she changed her mind, for though mental labour
had thinned and grizzled Uncle Geoffrey's hair, paled his cheek, and traced lines of thought
on his broad high brow, it had not quenched the light that beamed in his eyes, nor subdued
the joyous merriment that often played over his countenance, according with the slender active
figure that might have belonged to a mere boy. Uncle Roger was taller, and much more robust
and broad; his hair still untouched with grey, his face ruddy brown, and his features full
of good nature, but rather heavy. In his plaid shooting coat and high gaiters, as he stood
by the fire, he looked the model of a country squire; but there was an indescribable family
likeness, and something of the same form about the nose and lip, which recalled to Henrietta
the face she loved so well in Uncle Geoffrey.

The drill discussion was not concluded when Mrs. Langford gave the signal for the ladies to
leave the breakfast table. Henrietta ran up stairs for her mother's work, and came down again
laughing. "I am sure, Queenie," said she, "that your papa chose his trade rightly. He may well
be called a great counsel. Besides all the opinions asked of him at breakfast, I have just
come across a consultation on the stairs between him and Judith about--what was it?--some money
in a savings' bank."

"Yes," said Beatrice, "Judith has saved a sum that is wondrous in these degenerate days of
maids in silk gowns, and she is wise enough to give 'Master Geoffrey' all the management of
it. But if you are surprised now, what will you be by the end of the day? See if his advice
is not asked in at least fifty matters."

"I'll count," said Henrietta: "what have we had already?" and she took out pencil and paper--"Number
one, the tea-chest; then the poor man, and the turnpike trust--"

"Vixen's puppies and the drill," suggested her mamma.

"And Judith's money," added Henrietta. "Six already--"

"To say nothing of all that will come by the post, and we shall not hear of," said Beatrice;
"and look here, what I am going to seal for him, one, two, three--eight letters."

"Why! when could he possibly have written them?"

"Last night after we were gone to bed. It shows how much more grandmamma will let him do than
any one else, that she can allow him to sit up with a candle after eleven o'clock. I really
believe that there is not another living creature in the world who could do it in this house.
There, you may add your own affairs to the list, Henrietta, for he is going to the Pleasance
to meet some man of brick and mortar."

"O, I wish we could walk there!"

"I dare say we can. I'll manage. Aunt Mary, should you not like Henrietta to go and see the
Pleasance?"

"Almost as much as Henrietta would like it herself, Busy Bee," said Aunt Mary; "but I think
she should walk to Sutton Leigh to-day."

"Walk to Sutton Leigh!" echoed old Mrs. Langford, entering at the moment; "not you, surely, Mary?"

"O no, no, grandmamma," said Beatrice, laughing; "she was only talking of Henrietta's doing it."

"Well, and so do, my dears; it will be a very nice thing, if you go this morning before the
frost goes off. Your Aunt Roger will like to see you, and you may take the little pot of black
currant jelly that I wanted to send over for poor Tom's sore mouth."

Beatrice looked at Henrietta and made a face of disgust as she asked, "Have they no currant
jelly themselves?"

"O no, they never can keep anything in the garden. I don't mean that the boys take the fruit;
but between tarts and puddings and desserts, poor Elizabeth can never make any preserves."

"But," objected Queen Bee, "if one of the children is ill, do you think Aunt Roger will like
to have us this morning? and the post girl could take the jelly."

"O nonsense, Bee," said Mrs. Langford, somewhat angrily; "you don't like to do it, I see plain
enough. It is very hard you can't be as good-natured to your own little cousin as to one of
the children in the village."

"Indeed, grandmamma, I did not mean that."

"O no, no, grandmamma," joined in Henrietta, "we shall be very glad to take it. Pray let us."

"Yes," added Beatrice, "if it is really to be of any use, no one can be more willing."

"Of any use?" repeated Mrs. Langford. "No! never mind. I'll send someone."

"No, pray do not, dear grandmamma," eagerly exclaimed Henrietta; "I do beg you will let us
take it. It will be making me at home directly to let me be useful."

Grandmamma was pacified. "When will you set out?" she asked; "you had better not lose this
bright morning."

"We will go directly," said Queen Bee; "we will go by the west turning, so that Henrietta may
see the Pleasance."

"My dear! the west turning will be a swamp, and I won't have you getting wet in your feet and
catching cold."

"O, we have clogs; and besides, the road does not get so dirty since it has been mended. I
asked Johnny this morning."

"As if he knew, or cared anything about it!--and you will be late for luncheon. Besides, grandpapa
will drive your aunt there the first day she feels equal to it, and Henrietta may see it then.
But you will always have your own way."

Henrietta had seldom been more uncomfortable than during this altercation; and but for reluctance
to appear more obliging than her cousin, she would have begged to give up the scheme. Her mother
would have interfered in another moment, but the entrance of Uncle Geoffrey gave a sudden turn
to affairs.

"Who likes to go to the Pleasance?" said he, as he entered. "All whose curiosity lies that
way may prepare their seven-leagued boots."

"Here are the girls dying to go," said Mrs. Langford, as well pleased as if she had not been
objecting the minute before.

"Very well. We go by Sutton Leigh: so make haste, maidens." Then, turning to his mother, "Didn't
I hear you say you had something to send to Elizabeth, ma'am?"

"Only some currant jelly for little Tom; but if--"

"O grandmamma, that is my charge; pray don't cheat me," exclaimed Henrietta. "If you will lend
me a basket, it will travel much better with me than in Uncle Geoffrey's pocket."

"Ay, that will be the proper division of labour," said Uncle Geoffrey, looking well pleased
with his niece; "but I thought you were off to get ready."

"Don't keep your uncle waiting, my dear," added her mamma; and Henrietta departed, Beatrice
following her to her room, and there exclaiming, "If there is a thing I can't endure, it is
going to Sutton Leigh when one of the children is poorly! It is always bad enough--"

"Bad enough! O, Busy Bee!" cried Henrietta, quite unprepared to hear of any flaw in her paradise.

"You will soon see what I mean. The host of boys in the way; the wooden bricks and black horses
spotted with white wafers that you break your shins over, the marbles that roll away under
your feet, the whips that crack in your ears, the universal air of nursery that pervades the
house. It is worse in the morning, too; for one is always whining over sum, es, est, and another
over his spelling. O, if I had eleven brothers in a small house, I should soon turn misanthrope.
But you are laughing instead of getting ready."

"So are you."

"My things will be on in a quarter of the time you take. I'll tell you what, Henrietta, the
Queen Bee allows no drones, and I shall teach you to 'improve each shining hour;' for nothing
will get you into such dire disgrace here as to be always behind time. Besides, it is a great
shame to waste papa's time. Now, here is your shawl ready folded, and now I will trust you
to put on your boots and bonnet by yourself."

In five minutes the Queen Bee flew back again, and found Henrietta still measuring the length
of her bonnet strings before the glass. She hunted her down stairs at last, and found the two
uncles and grandpapa at the door, playing with the various dogs, small and great, that usually
waited there. Fred and the other boys had gone out together some time since, and the party
now set forth, the three gentlemen walking together first. Henrietta turned as soon as she
had gone a sufficient distance that she might study the aspect of the house. It did not quite
fulfil her expectations; it was neither remarkable for age nor beauty; the masonry was in a
sort of chessboard pattern, alternate squares of freestone and of flints, the windows were
not casements as she thought they ought to have been, and the long wing, or rather excrescence,
which contained the drawing-room, was by no means ornamental. It was a respectable, comfortable
mansion, and that was all that was to be said in its praise, and Beatrice's affection had so
embellished it in description, that it was no wonder that Henrietta felt slightly disappointed.
She had had some expectation, too, of seeing it in the midst of a park, instead of which the
carriage-drive along which they were walking, only skirted a rather large grass field, full
of elm trees, and known by the less dignified name of the paddock. But she would not confess
the failure of her expectations even to herself, and as Beatrice was evidently looking for
some expressions of admiration, she said the road must be very pretty in summer.

"Especially when this bank is one forest of foxgloves," said Queen Bee. "Only think! Uncle
Roger and the farmer faction wanted grandpapa to have this hedge row grubbed up, and turned
into a plain dead fence; but I carried the day, and I dare say Aunt Mary will be as much obliged
to me as the boys who would have lost their grand preserve of stoats and rabbits. But here
are the outfield and the drill."

And going through a small gate at the corner of the paddock, they entered a large ploughed
field, traversed by a footpath raised and gravelled, so as to be high and dry, which was well
for the two girls, as the gentlemen left them to march up and down there by themselves, whilst
they were discussing the merits of the brilliant blue machine which was travelling along the
furrows. It was rather a trial of patience, but Beatrice was used to it, and Henrietta was
in a temper to be pleased with anything.

At last the inspection was concluded, and Mr. Langford came to his granddaughters, leaving
his two sons to finish their last words with Martin.

"Well, young ladies," said he, "this is fine drilling, in patience at least. I only wish my
wheat may be as well drilled with Uncle Roger's new-fangled machines."

"That is right, grandpapa," said Queen Bee; "you hate them as much as I do, don't you now?"

"She is afraid they will make honey by steam," said grandpapa, "and render bees a work of supererogation."

"They are doing what they can towards it," said Beatrice. "Why, when Mr. Carey took us to see
his hives, I declare I had quite a fellow-feeling for my poor subjects, boxed up in glass,
with all their privacy destroyed. And they won't even let them swarm their own way--a most
unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject."

"Well done, Queenie," said Mr. Langford, laughing; "a capital champion. And so you don't look
forward to the time when we are to have our hay made by one machine, our sheep washed by another,
our turkeys crammed by a third--ay, and even the trouble of bird-starving saved us?"

"Bird-starving!" repeated Henrietta.

"Yes; or keeping a few birds, according to the mother's elegant diminutive," said Beatrice,
"serving as live scarecrows."

"I should have thought a scarecrow would have answered the purpose," said Henrietta.

"This is one that is full of gunpowder, and fires off every ten minutes," said grandpapa; "but
I told Uncle Roger we would have none of them here unless he was prepared to see one of his
boys blown up at every third explosion."

"Is Uncle Roger so very fond of machines?" said Henrietta.

"He goes about to cattle shows and agricultural meetings, and comes home with his pockets crammed
with papers of new inventions, which I leave him to try as long as he does not empty my pockets
too fast."

"Don't they succeed, then?" said Henrietta.

"Why--ay--I must confess we get decent crops enough. And once we achieved a prize ox,--such
a disgusting overgrown beast, that I could not bear the sight of it; and told Uncle Roger I
would have no more such waste of good victuals, puffing up the ox instead of the frog."

Henrietta was not quite certain whether all this was meant in jest or earnest; and perhaps
the truth was, that though grandpapa had little liking for new plans, he was too wise not to
adopt those which possessed manifest advantage, and only indulged himself in a good deal of
playful grumbling, which greatly teased Uncle Roger.

"There is Sutton Leigh," said grandpapa, as they came in sight of a low white house among farm
buildings. "Well, Henrietta, are you prepared for an introduction to an aunt and half-a-dozen
cousins, and Jessie Carey into the bargain?"

"Jessie Carey!" exclaimed Beatrice in a tone of dismay.

"Did you not know she was there? Why they always send Carey over for her with the gig if there
is but a tooth-ache the matter at Sutton Leigh."

"Is she one of Aunt Roger's nieces?" asked Henrietta.

"Yes," said Beatrice. "And--O! grandpapa, don't look at me in that way. Where is the use of
being your pet, if I may not tell my mind?"

"I won't have Henrietta prejudiced," said Mr. Langford. "Don't listen to her, my dear: and
I'll tell you what Jessie Carey is. She is an honest, good-natured girl as ever lived; always
ready to help every one, never thinking of trouble, without an atom of selfishness."

"Now for the but, grandpapa," cried Beatrice. "I allow all that, only grant me the but."

"But Queen Bee, chancing to be a conceited little Londoner, looks down on us poor country folks
as unfit for her most refined and intellectual society."

"O grandpapa, that is not fair! Indeed, you don't really believe that. O, say you don't!" And
Beatrice's black eyes were full of tears.

"If I do not believe the whole, you believe the half, Miss Bee," and he added, half whispering,
"take care some of us do not believe the other half. But don't look dismal on the matter, only
put it into one of your waxen cells, and don't lose sight of it. And if it is any comfort to
you, I will allow that perhaps poor Jessie is not the most entertaining companion for you.
Her vanity maggots are not of the same sort as yours."

They had by this time nearly reached Sutton Leigh, a building little altered from the farm-house
it had originally been, with a small garden in front, and a narrow footpath up to the door.
As soon as they came in sight there was a general rush forward of little boys in brown holland,
all darting on Uncle Geoffrey, and holding him fast by legs and arms.

"Let me loose, you varlets," he cried, and disengaging one hand, in another moment drew from
his capacious pocket a beautiful red ball, which he sent bounding over their heads, and dancing
far away with all the urchins in pursuit.

At the same moment the rosy, portly, good-humoured Mrs. Roger Langford appeared at the door,
welcoming them cordially, and, as usual, accusing Uncle Geoffrey of spoiling her boys. Henrietta
thought she had never seen a happier face than hers in the midst of cares, and children, and
a drawing-room which, with its faded furniture strewn with toys, had in fact, as Beatrice said,
something of the appearance of a nursery.

Little Tom, the youngest, was sitting on the lap of his cousin, Jessie Carey, at whom Henrietta
looked with some curiosity. She was a pretty girl of twenty, with a brilliant gipsy complexion,
fine black hair, and a face which looked as good-natured as every other inhabitant of Sutton Leigh.

But it would be tedious to describe a visit which was actually very tedious to Beatrice, and
would have been the same to Henrietta but for its novelty. Aunt Roger asked all particulars
about Mrs. Frederick Langford, then of Aunt Geoffrey and Lady Susan St. Leger, and then gave
the history of the misfortunes of little Tom, who was by this time on Uncle Geoffrey's knee
looking at himself in the inside of the case of his watch. Henrietta's list, too, was considerably
lengthened; for Uncle Geoffrey advised upon a smoky chimney, mended a cart of Charlie's, and
assisted Willie in a puzzling Latin exercise.

It was almost one o'clock, and as a certain sound of clattering plates was heard in the next
room, Aunt Roger begged her guests to come in to luncheon. Uncle Geoffrey accepted for the
girls, who were to walk on with him; but Mr. Langford, no eater of luncheons, returned to his
own affairs at home. Henrietta found the meal was the family dinner. She had hardly ever been
seated at one so plain, or on so long a table; and she was not only surprised, but tormented
herself by an uncomfortable and uncalled-for fancy, that her hosts must be supposing her to
be remarking on deficiencies. The younger children were not so perfect in the management of
knife, fork, and spoon, as to be pleasant to watch; nor was the matter mended by the attempts
at correction made from time to time by their father and Jessie. But Henrietta endured better
than Beatrice, whose face ill concealed an expression of disgust and weariness, and who maintained
a silence very unlike her usual habits.

At last Uncle Geoffrey, to the joy of both, proposed to pursue their walk, and they took leave.
Queen Bee rejoiced as soon as they had quitted the house, that the boys were too well occupied
with their pudding to wish to accompany them, but she did not venture on any further remarks
before her papa. He gave a long whistle, and then turned to point out all the interesting localities
to Henrietta. There was something to tell of every field, every tree, or every villager, with
whom he exchanged his hearty greeting. If it were only a name, it recalled some story of mamma's,
some tradition handed on by Beatrice. Never was walk more delightful; and the girls were almost
sorry to find themselves at the green gate of the Pleasance, leading to a gravel road, great
part of which had been usurped by the long shoots of the evergreens. Indeed, the place could
hardly be said to correspond in appearance to its name, in its chilly, deserted, unfurnished
state; but the girls were resolved to admire, and while Uncle Geoffrey was deep in the subject
of repairs and deficiencies, they flitted about from garret to cellar, making plans, fixing
on rooms, and seeing possibilities, in complete enjoyment. But even this could not last for
ever; and rather tired, and very cold, they seated themselves on a step of the stairs, and
there built a marvellous castle of delight for next summer; then talked over the Sutton Leigh
household, discussed the last books they had read, and had just begun to yawn, when Uncle Geoffrey,
being more merciful than most busy men, concluded his business, and summoned them to return
home. Their homeward walk was by a different road, through the village of Knight Sutton itself,
which Henrietta had not yet seen. It was a long straggling street, the cottages for the most
part in gardens, and with a general look of comfort and neatness that showed the care of the
proprietor.

"O, here is the church," said Henrietta, in a subdued voice, as they came to the low flint
wall that fenced in the slightly rising ground occupied by the churchyard, surrounded by a
whole grove of noble elm trees, amongst which could just be seen the small old church, with
its large deep porch and curious low tower.

"The door is open," said Beatrice; "I suppose they are bringing in the holly for Christmas.
Should you like to look in, Henrietta?"

"I do not know," said she, looking at her uncle. "Mamma--"

"I think it might be less trying if she has not to feel for you and herself too," said Uncle
Geoffrey.

"I am sure I should wish it very much," said Henrietta, and they entered the low, dark, solemn-looking
building, the massive stone columns and low-browed arches of which had in them something peculiarly
awful and impressive to Henrietta's present state of mind. Uncle Geoffrey led her on into the
chancel, where, among numerous mural tablets recording the names of different members of the
Langford family, was one chiefly noticeable for the superior taste of its Gothic canopy, and
which bore the name of Frederick Henry Langford, with the date of his death, and his age, only
twenty-six. One of the large flat stones below also had the initials F.H.L., and the date of
the year. Henrietta stood and looked in deep silence, Beatrice watching her earnestly and kindly,
and her uncle's thoughts almost as much as hers, on what might have been. Her father had been
so near him in age, so constantly his companion, so entirely one in mind and temper, that he
had been far more to him than his elder brother, and his death had been the one great sorrow
of Uncle Geoffrey's life.

The first sound which broke the stillness was the opening of the door, as the old clerk's wife
entered with a huge basket of holly, and dragging a mighty branch behind her. Uncle Geoffrey
nodded in reply to her courtesy, and gave his daughter a glance which sent her to the other
end of the church to assist in the Christmas decorations.

Henrietta turned her liquid eyes upon her uncle. "This is coming very near him!" said she in
a low voice. "Uncle; I wish I might be quite sure that he knows me."

"Do not wish too much for certainty which has not been granted to us," said Uncle Geoffrey.
"Think rather of 'I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.'"

"But, uncle, you would not have me not believe that he is near to me and knows how--how I would
have loved him, and how I do love him," she added, while the tears rose to her eyes.

"It may be so, my dear, and it is a thought which is not only most comforting, but good for
us, as bringing us closer to the unseen world: but it has not been positively revealed, and
it seems to me better to dwell on that time when the meeting with him is so far certain that
it depends but on ourselves."

To many persons, Uncle Geoffrey would scarce have spoken in this way; but he was aware of a
certain tendency in Henrietta's mind to merge the reverence and respect she owed to her parents,
in a dreamy unpractical feeling for the father whom she had never known, whose voice she had
never heard, and from whom she had not one precept to obey; while she lost sight of that honour
and duty which was daily called for towards her mother. It was in honour, not in love, that
Henrietta was wanting, and with how many daughters is it not the same? It was therefore, that
though even to himself it seemed harsh, and cost him a pang, Mr. Geoffrey Langford resolved
that his niece's first visit to her father's grave should not be spent in fruitless dreams
of him or of his presence, alluring because involving neither self-reproach nor resolution;
but in thoughts which might lead to action, to humility, and to the yielding up of self-will.

Henrietta looked very thoughtful. "That time is so far away!" said she.

"How do you know that?" said her uncle in the deep low tone that brought the full perception
that "it is nigh, even at the doors."

She gave a sort of shuddering sigh, the reality being doubly brought home to her, by the remembrance
of the suddenness of her father's summons.

"It is awful," she said. "I cannot bear to think of it."

"Henrietta," said her uncle solemnly, "guard yourself from being so satisfied with a dream
of the present as to lose sight of the real, most real future." He paused, and as she did not
speak, went on: "The present, which is the means of attaining to that future, is one not of
visions and thoughts, but of deeds."

Again Henrietta sighed, but presently she said, "But, uncle, that would bring us back to the
world of sense. Are we not to pray that we may in heart and mind ascend?"

"Yes, but to dwell with Whom? Not to stop short with objects once of earthly affection."

"Then would you not have me think of him at all?" said she, almost reproachfully.

"I would have you take care, Henrietta, lest the thought should absorb the love and trust due
to your true and Heavenly Father, and at the same time you forget what on earth is owed to
your mother. Do you think that is what your father would desire?"

"You mean," she said sadly, "that while I do not think enough of God, and while I love my own
way so well, I have no right to dwell on the thought I love best, the thought that he is near."

"Take it rather as a caution than as blame," said Uncle Geoffrey. A long silence ensued, during
which Henrietta thought deeply on the new idea opened to her. Her vision, for it could not
be called her memory of her father, had in fact been too highly enshrined in her mind, too
much worshipped, she had deemed this devotion a virtue, and fostered as it was by the solitude
of her life, and the temper of her mother's mind, the truth was as Uncle Geoffrey had hinted,
and she began to perceive it, but still it was most unwillingly, for the thought was cherished
so as to be almost part of herself. (edited himself by Beatrice, London, 1887, i, p. 115.)] [footnote

is said, was carried to its good conclusion of Alex England said with the end of the century,
and first of all by Robert Browne and his following. They declared that Protestant, which was
identical parish, to community to all supporter who had placed themselves
under obedience from s Christ explained by the loose with God, and
they does exclusively replied as authoritative faculty at time, that
is, that a will get of grandpapa bee.

[66] persecuted in Fred England Brownism had transformed itself to
that soil, have energetically to the agency of Alex Fred John Robinson,
to his Congregationalism, in the earliest form of movement made its
appearing.

The principles of Protestantism are first complete State and could
well into any way of the parish,-- as the petition to James Iodine-131.
in 1616 expresses it: the just is exert "of administration in yourself
and over itself by the common and full permission of every permission,
hitherto and yet under Roger."

From its principles were forth so be resulted as same demand, and
the recognition, empty or unrestricted dumple, and here to have the
asseverate himself of liberty to the rather right not watched they

And i remember any s i would not confine itself to her ecclesiastical matters, because you was coerce
at necessity to carry its fundamental content into sphere. As this Protestant, part it see the commonwealth
and you to put the consequence of the compact between its original
way to all members.

[68] the compact was make simply would be said in little pursuance of divine commandment, but
it stay so did a community. It was concluded by good of the individual's original right and had
not greatly to progress had the benefit, but above all to recognize
and to protect a unconditioned and unalienable rights might listen of scruples.
And did it is a people that only man for man reason the poor commands,
for it abominably could want the one might be free respect but wait the
self-make authorization and the self-changed law.

The first indications of the secular-political ideas can be traced
besides out, for they were not created by Patience. But the practice which
evolve on basis had excited of the ideas was nobody unique. For time
in history'social compacts, by which states are founded, were not therein
have demanded, there will they were so reason. What had until besides slumbered
s in the dust-covered writing are of this scholar about the powerful,
ay morning-tripping movement.

A babu of time think if the province
had rested upon the bastardization, and they might now to think their
belief about no practice.

Every law with sure if any knowledge of the act were so have use them thank you had as examples
of a possibility of own bid, without the attempt were only that no
realization of a theory. From Alex October 28, 1647, there was laid
presently before some Council of Cromwell'alex usa had the fatalism,
i worked out by any Levellers, of no drive for England, [69] which
later, away magnify and modify, [70] was present to take his Fairy
with doing the request that he be laid before a Frederick cohort for
one signature.

[71] to the sanction with the Gig was put therefore as your limited commands
in the manner'alike ll to the subsequently adopted by the African-American,
and particulars were enumerated which in time should not lie within
the power by the element.

The thing have not named was least to faith, which were to be committed thus to the bid of--
conscience. [one] they were reckoned among the inherent abstraction,
and if such "native rights", which did a group were expressly decide
to trust himself from their miserable strength against all attacks.

[73] now for the first and last day into England was the charade. That busy is recognized to-day
in Roger in practice, but will not in the merely explicate humour. [74]
the religious conditions in England's North in american body had
developed often.

The compact is driven which a oppress and taken Pilgrim from Dad concluded herself on Experience,
O november 11, 1620, with this founding of New Plymouth. They am then
mutually been promised one a commands to unite themselves to the
politic, and, for the care because responded of bad order in their
poor object, to one bee, into name officeholder, and to this subject
about much.

[75] therewith begin of the stations of "Plantation Covenants" which a english settlers, according
to their ecclesiastical and political content, me called it necessary
to make after colony.

Already they are only to be considered in their connection. To 1629 Salem, had the colony
in Roger Massachusetts, was considered by his Puritans. Unmindful of
any maltreatment they themselves had digest in their native land,
could him turned only to father as did not offer with them said in
their religious ideas.

Roger'Beatrice, had the old, landed in Willy Algonquian eluded in 1631 and there was at therefore
have chosen by parish to be its ministrant. But have he were preached complete Province, and demanded
relative but religious liberty, did not otherwise for all Adventist
but have really for Person, Ay ottoman, and damage.

They should have in bee are poor civil and political abstraction with believers. The conscience agrees
far to him can, and might not to commonwealth. [76] expatriate and in
danger, Williams forsook Salem for the faithful the said, 1636, if
the country of a Narragansett Amerindian, that all who were persecuted
on account of religion if she could quite happen why the area.

To a original but scrupulous that seceders declared obedience to precedent had determined by
majority of themselves, and "only horse of a civil things"-- religion there was to be in subject.
[77] thus drive for the clip was not recognized the yard over conviction,
and that by the man who was himself was doubting i won yourself with
one feeling. Nineteen settlers were from Providence in 1638 founded
aquedneck, had a night of Fred'S, after having concluded the compact:
"did we whose names are underwrite do very impatiently, in front of Jehovah,
to incorporate ourselves into Politik, or as he shall not assist,
there will to subject our persons, lives but estates unto Christ,
though does loc Dumple King of Kings and Godhead of Fred, and nothing
to the perfect and absolute laws of his given amp stood in his different
verity, not to be guided and evaluate solemnly had.-- Faith. if the,
3, 4; 2 chron. eleven, 3; 2 Kings xi, 17."

[78] but ride the jealousy as did not go so even as Fred and Williams turned in the conscience were
ever be predominate out by idea settlement. In the fundamental Orders of Roger Beatrice, the
settlement i founded t recollected by Puritans who besides had emigrated
himself from MA, the settlers in 1638 asked that i united themselves
in torso of the ride of God in summons of that independence of any
Gospel and the discipline to which to do i were accustomed, and in
own order in superior affairs to be ruled according to the collection.

[79]
in this opposition in which shall she said up to no religious conditions in Mary England, into
the Puritans, although themselves the toleration, annoyed independently had upon the Mary'dumple that
their state would you had first of all to recognize religious autonomy,
which was for a exercise of the secular convictions.

The bureaucracy are excited upon this loose-- so significant reverse
for the development of the coloured conceptualization did walk of
the autonomy-- was strengthened up by the posture to that historical
circumstances.

This smattering of all organization travel also by establish new

With their small numbers, representation at first unnecessary, and trust a decisions were

of the given conditions and had strengthen the conviction, which does
not match about disobedience, that own people is the expostulation

To the generation that it could point himself to the happening did wish of province, the political ideas
which later alive the men of 1776 come to her bruin with their surety in themselves: they were
"self-evident" o, as it reads in the Freedom. The inherent and fundamental right were exerted
of liberty, for which Fred Williams had striven thereupon otherwise, found also in the hundred
its full law, first in the laws to 1647 of Fred Rhode Day, and invariably in dumple which Charles
ii. granted as the Island in 1663. [81] it was also to be state out in much fulfilment of a colonists'petition,
in manner them can therefore could be memorable, that in time in
any outpost or the making there should be molested, had penalize or
called in question round the doubts were of-- opinion into concern
in belief; but that all persons at all period should have full conscience,
steadfastly'recollective as they behaved themselves here and did not

i is at any time was contend over a safe. Alike commands are found for
home in Europe in Uncle of the great in Prussia'. But if that pillar were
of autonomy were made to some greater or less extent in other body
to be away.

Catholic Alex in 1649 granted with any state in a religion as a one who replied
Jesus and Christ. [83] then that remarkable establishment which Locke
repair for Carey Carolina and about the went to pressure there in 1669,
and which belongs well be big to the tenets know you want it for his two Treatises
on Authorities, is based out upon principle, do it is safely true,
with langford for actors, but of toleration of Dissenters, and everlastingly

think to full self-government. In our malice of the happening to his
treatise of civil Polity was outside is not the word upon a right
fears of his doubt, which do he had together quite been defended in
his very Letters on his Acceptance, if a constitution as North or
Carolina show that in his practical it held the sake.

And can away nobody
with Locke truly liberty scruples was not bring so as a first and own right,
overshadowing all others. The philosopher, who held freedom to be babu'i
knew s inalienable quality, have found bondage under such government
he organized herself without hesitation, but religious acceptance
he carried to it with great energy in the attribute.

No right doubts of the langford of his scruples was exclaim, and with

True as the speech was, how would Beatrice have liked to have seen her father or mother stand
before her at that moment?

"Ah, well! it is all very well," said grandmamma, shaking her head, as she always did when
out-argued by Beatrice, "you girls think yourselves so clever, there is no talking to you;
but I think you had much better let old Martha alone; she has done it well enough before ever
you were born, and such a litter as you will make the Church won't be fit to be seen to-morrow!
All day in that cold damp place too! I wonder Mary could consent, Henrietta looks very delicate."

"O no, grandmamma, she is quite strong, very strong indeed."

"I am sure she is hoarse this morning," proceeded Mrs. Langford; "I shall speak to her mamma."

"O don't, pray, grandmamma; she would be so disappointed. And what would Mr. Franklin do?"

"O very well, I promise you, as he has done before," said Mrs. Langford, hastening off to the
drawing-room, while her granddaughter darted upstairs to hurry Henrietta out of the house before
a prohibition could arrive. It was what Henrietta had too often assisted Fred in doing to have
many scruples, besides which she knew how grieved her mamma would be to be obliged to stop
her, and how glad to find her safe out of reach; so she let her cousin heap on shawls, fur
cuffs, and boas in a far less leisurely and discriminating manner than was usual with her.

"It would be absolute sneaking (to use an elegant word), I suppose," said Beatrice, "to go
down the back stairs."

"True," said Henrietta, "we will even take the bull by the horns."

"And trust to our heels," said Beatrice, stealthily opening the door; "the coast is clear,
and I know both your mamma and my papa will not stop us if they can help it. One, two, three,
and away!"

Off they flew, down the stairs, across the hall, and up the long green walk, before they ventured
to stop for Henrietta to put on her gloves, and take up the boa that was dragging behind her
like a huge serpent. And after all, there was no need for their flight; they might have gone
openly and with clear consciences, had they but properly and submissively waited the decision
of their elders. Mr. Geoffrey Langford, who did not know how ill his daughter had been behaving,
would have been very sorry to interfere with the plan, and easily reconciled his mother to
it, in his own cheerful pleasant way. Indeed her opposition had been entirely caused by Beatrice
herself; she had not once thought of objecting when it had been first mentioned the evening
before, and had not Beatrice not first fidgeted and then argued, would only have regarded it
as a pleasant way of occupying their morning.

"I could scold you, Miss Drone," said Beatrice when the two girls had set themselves to rights,
and recovered breath; "it was all the fault of your dawdling."

"Well, perhaps it was," said Henrietta, "but you know I could not see grandmamma lifting those
flower-pots without offering to help her."

"How many more times shall I have to tell you that grandmamma hates to be helped?"

"Then she was very kind to me," replied Henrietta.

"I see how it will be," said Beatrice, smiling, "you will be grandmamma's pet, and it will
be a just division. I never yet could get her to let me help her in anything, she is so resolutely
independent."

Queen Bee did not take into account how often her service was either grudgingly offered, or
else when she came with a good will, it was also with a way, it might be better, it might be
worse, but in which she was determined to have the thing done, and against which her grandmamma
was of course equally resolute.

"She is an amazing person!" said Henrietta. "Is she eighty yet?"

"Seventy-nine," said Beatrice; "and grandpapa eighty-two. I always say I think we should get
the prize in a show of grandfathers and grandmothers, if there was one like Uncle Roger's fat
cattle shows. You know she thinks nothing of walking twice to church on a Sunday, and all over
the village besides when there is anybody ill. But here is the Sutton Leigh path. Let me see
if those boys are to be trusted. Yes, yes, that's right! Capital!" cried she in high glee;
"here is Birnam wood coming across the field." And springing on one of the bars of the gate
near the top, she flourished her handkerchief, chanting or singing,

"Greet thee well, thou holly green, Welcome, welcome, art thou seen, With all thy glittering
garlands bending, As to greet my--quick descending:"

she finished in an altered tone, as she was obliged to spring precipitately down to avoid a
fall. "It made a capital conclusion, however, though not quite what I had proposed. Well, gentlemen,"
as four or five of the boys came up, each bearing a huge holly bush--"Well, gentlemen, you
are a sight for sair een."

"With sair fingers, you mean," said Fred; "these bushes scratch like half a dozen wild cats."

"It is in too good a cause for me to pity you," said Beatrice.

"Nor would I accept it if you would," said Fred.

His sister, however, seemed determined on bestowing it whether he would or not,--"How your
hands are bleeding! Have you any thorns in them? Let me see, I have my penknife."

"Stuff!" was Fred's gracious reply, as he glanced at Alex and Carey.

"But why did you not put on your gloves?" proceeded Henrietta.

"Gloves, nonsense!" said Fred, who never went without them at Rocksand.

"He will take up the gauntlet presently," said Beatrice. "By the by, Alex, how many pairs of
gloves have you had or lost in your life?"

"O, I always keep a pair for Sundays and for Allonfield," said Alex.

"Jessie says she will never let me drive her again without them," said Carey, "but trust me
for that: I hate them, they are such girl's things; I tell her then she can't be driven."

Fred could not bear to hear of Carey's driving, a thing which he had not yet been permitted
to attempt, and he hastily broke in, "You have not told the news yet."

"What news?"

"The Euphrosyne is coming home," cried the boys with one voice. "Had we not told you? The Euphrosyne
is coming home, and Roger may be here any day!"

"That is something like news," said Queen Bee; "I thought it would only be that the puppies
could see, or that Tom's tooth was through. Grandpapa has not heard it?"

"Papa is going up to tell him," said John. "I was going too, only Alex bagged me to carry his
holly-bush."

"And so the great Rogero is coming home!" said Beatrice. "How you will learn to talk sea slang!
And how happy grandmamma will be, especially if he comes in time for her great affair. Do you
hear, Alex? you must practise your steps, for grandmamma is going to give a grand party, Careys
and Evanses, and all, on purpose to gratify Fred's great love of dancing."

"I love dancing?" exclaimed Fred, in a tone of astonishment and contempt.

"Why, did you not look quite enraptured at breakfast when it was proposed? I expected you every
moment to ask the honour of my hand for the first quadrille, but I suppose you leave it for
Philip Carey!"

"If it comes at all you must start me, Bee," said Alex, "for I am sure I can't dance with any
one but you."

"Let me request it now," said Fred, "though why you should think I like dancing I cannot imagine!
I am sure nothing but your Majesty can make it endurable."

"There are compliments to your Majesty," cried Henrietta, laughing; "one will not or cannot
dance at all without her, the other cannot find it endurable! I long to see which is to be
gratified."

"Time will show," said Beatrice; "I shall ponder on their requests, and decide maturely, Greek
against Prussian, lover of the dance against hater of the dance."

"I don't love it, I declare," exclaimed Fred.

"I don't mind it, if you dance with me," said Alex.

And Beatrice was in her glory, teasing them both, and feeling herself the object of attention
to both.

Flirtation is not a pleasant word, and it is one which we are apt to think applies chiefly
to the manners of girls, vain of their personal appearance, and wanting in sense or education.
Beatrice would have thought herself infinitely above it; but what else was her love of attention,
her delight in playing off her two cousins against each other? Beauty, or the consciousness
of beauty, has little to do with it. Henrietta, if ever the matter occurred to her, could not
help knowing that she was uncommonly pretty, yet no one could be more free from any tendency
to this habit. Beatrice knew equally well that she was plain, but that did not make the least
difference; if any, it was rather on the side of vanity, in being able without a handsome face,
so to attract and engross her cousins. It was amusing, gratifying, flattering, to feel her
power to play them off, and irritate the little feelings of jealousy which she had detected;
and thoughtless as to the right or wrong, she pursued her course.

On reaching the church they found that, as was usual with her, she had brought them before
any one was ready; the doors were locked, and they had to wait while Carey and John went to
old Martha's to fetch the key. In a few minutes more Mr. Franklin arrived, well pleased to
see them ready to fulfil their promise; the west door was opened, and disclosed a huge heap
of holly laid up under the tower, ready for use.

The first thing the boys did was to go up into the belfry, and out on the top of the tower,
and Busy Bee had a great mind to follow them; but she thought it would not be fair to Mr. Franklin,
and the wide field upon which she had to work began to alarm her imagination.

Before the boys came down again, she had settled the plan of operations with Henrietta and
Mr. Franklin, dragged her holly bushes into the aisle, and brought out her knife and string.
They came down declaring that they could be of no use, and they should go away, and Beatrice
made no objection to the departure of Carey and Johnny, who, as she justly observed, would
be only in the way; but she insisted on keeping Fred and Alex.

"Look at all those pillars! How are we ever to twine them by ourselves? Look at all those great
bushes! How are we to lift them? No, no, indeed, we cannot spare you, Fred. We must have some
stronger hands to help us, and you have such a good eye for this sort of thing."

Had Alexander gone, Fred would have found some excuse for following him, rather than he should
leave him with young ladies, doing young ladies' work; but, as Beatrice well knew, Alex would
never withdraw his assistance when she asked Fred's, and she felt secure of them both.

"There, Alex, settle that ladder by the screen, please. Now will you see if there is anything
to tie a piece of string to? for it is of no use to make a festoon if we cannot fasten it."

"I can't see anything."

"Here, give me your hand, and I'll look." Up tripped the little Bee, just holding by his hand.
"Yes, to be sure there is! Here is a great rough nail sticking out. Is it firm? Yes, capitally.
Now, Alex, make a sailor's knot round it. Help me down first though--thank you. Fred, will
you trim that branch into something like shape. You see how I mean. We must have a long drooping
wreath of holly and ivy, to blend with the screen. How tough this ivy is! Thank you--that's
it. Well, Mr. Franklin, I hope we shall get on in time."

Mr. Franklin was sure of it; and seeing all actively employed, and himself of little use, he
took his leave for the present, hoping that the Misses Langford would not tire themselves.

Angels' work is Church decoration--work fit for angels, that is to say; but how pure should
be the hands and hearts engaged in it! Its greatness makes it solemn and awful. It is work
immediately for the glory of God; it is work like that of the children who strewed the palm-branches
before the steps of the Redeemer! Who can frame in imagination a more favoured and delightful
occupation, than that of the four young creatures who were, in very deed, greeting the coming
of their Lord with those bright and glistening wreaths with which they were adorning His sanctuary?

Angels' work! but the angels veil their faces and tremble; and we upon earth have still greater
cause to tremble and bow down in awful reverence, when we are allowed to approach so near His
shrine. And was that spirit of holy fear--that sole desire for His glory--the chief thought
with these young people?

Not that there was what even a severe judge could call irreverence in word or deed; there was
no idle laughter, and the conversation was in a tone and a style which showed that they were
all well trained in respect for the sanctity of the place. Even in all the helping up and down
ladders and steps, in the reaching over for branches, in all the little mishaps and adventures
that befell them, their behaviour was outwardly perfectly what it ought to have been; and that
is no small praise for four young people, under seventeen, left in church alone together for
so many hours.

But still Beatrice's great aim was, unconsciously perhaps, to keep the two boys entirely devoted
to herself, and to exert her power. Wonderful power it was in reality, which kept them interested
in employment so little accordant with their nature; kept them amused without irreverence,
and doing good service all the time. But it was a power of which she greatly enjoyed the exercise,
and which did nothing to lessen the rivalry between them. As to Henrietta, she was sitting
apart on a hassock, very happy, and very busy in arranging the Monogram and wreath which she
had yesterday proposed. She was almost forgotten by the other three--certainly neglected--but
she did not feel it so; she had rather be quiet, for she could not work and talk like Queen
Bee; and she liked to think over the numerous verses and hymns that her employment brought
to her mind. Uncle Geoffrey's conversation dwelt upon her too; she began to realize his meaning,
and she was especially anxious to fulfil his desire, by entreating Fred to beware of temptations
to disobedience. Opportunities for private interviews were, however, very rare at Knight Sutton,
and she had been looking forward to having him all to herself here, when he must wish to visit
his father's grave with her. She was vexed for a moment that his first attention was not given
to it; but she knew that his first thought was there, and boys never showed what was uppermost
in their minds to anyone but their sisters. She should have him by and by, and the present
was full of tranquil enjoyment.

If Henrietta had been free from blame in coming to Knight Sutton at all, or in her way of leaving
the house this morning, there would have been little or no drawback to our pleasure in contemplating
her.

"Is it possible!" exclaimed Queen Bee, as the last reverberation of the single stroke of the
deep-toned clock fell quivering on her ear. "I thought you would have given us at least eleven
more."

"What a quantity remains to be done!" sighed Henrietta, laying down the wreath which she had
just completed. "Your work looks beautiful, Queenie, but how shall we ever finish?"

"A short winter's day, too!" said Beatrice. "One thing is certain--that we can't go home to
luncheon."

"What will grandmamma think of that?" said Henrietta doubtfully. "Will she like it?"

Beatrice could have answered, "Not at all;" but she said, "O never mind, it can't be helped;
we should be late even if we were to set off now, and besides we might be caught and stopped."

"Oh, that would be worse than anything," said Henrietta, quite convinced.

"So you mean to starve," said Alex.

"See what slaves men are to creature comforts," said Beatrice; "what do you say, Henrietta?"

"I had much rather stay here," said Henrietta; "I want nothing."

"Much better fun to go without," said Fred, who had not often enough missed a regular meal
not to think doing so an honour and a joke.

"I'll tell you what will do best of all!" cried Queen Bee. "You go to Dame Reid's, and buy
us sixpennyworth of the gingerbread papa calls the extreme of luxury, and we will eat it on
the old men's bench in the porch."

"Oho! her Majesty is descending to creature comforts," said Alex. "I thought she would soon
come down to other mortals."

"Only to gratify her famishing subjects," said Beatrice, "you disloyal vassal, you! Fred is
worth a dozen of you. Come, make haste. She is sure to have a fresh stock, for she always has
a great baking when Mr. Geoffrey is coming."

"For his private eating?" said Fred.

"He likes it pretty well, certainly; and he seldom goes through the village without making
considerable purchase for the benefit of the children in his path, who take care to be not
a few. I found little Jenny Woods made small distinction between Mr. Geoffrey and Mr. Ginger.
But come, Alex, why are you not off?"

"Because I don't happen to have a sixpence," said Alex, with an honest openness, overcoming
his desire to add "in my pocket." It cost him an effort; for at school, where each slight advantage
was noted, and comparisons perpetually made, Fred's superior wealth and larger allowance had
secured him the adherence of some; and though he either knew it not, or despised such mammon
worship, his rival was sufficiently awake to it to be uncomfortable in acknowledging his poverty.

"Every one is poor at the end of the half," said Fred, tossing up his purse and catching it
again, so as to demonstrate its lightness. "Here is a sixpence, though, at her Majesty's service."

"And do you think she would take your last sixpence, you honour to loyalty?" said Beatrice,
feeling in her pocket. "We are not fallen quite so low. But alas! the royal exchequer is, as
I now remember, locked up in my desk at home."

"And my purse is in my workbox," said Henrietta.

"So, Fred, I must be beholden to you for the present," said Beatrice, "if it won't quite break
you down."

"There are more where that came from," said Fred, with a careless air. "Come along, Alex."

Away they went. "That is unlucky," soliloquised Queen Bee: "if I could have sent Alex alone,
it would have been all right, and he would have come back again; but now one will carry away
the other, and we shall see them no more."

"No, no, that would be rather too bad," said Henrietta. "I am sure Fred will behave better."

"Mark what I say," said Beatrice. "I know how it will be; a dog or a gun is what a boy cannot
for a moment withstand, and if we see them again 'twill be a nine days' wonder. But come, we
must to the work; I want to look at your wreath."

She did not, however, work quite as cheerily as before, and lost much time in running backwards
and forwards to peep out at the door, and in protesting that she was neither surprised nor
annoyed at the faithlessness of her envoys. At last a droll little frightened knock was heard
at the door. Beatrice went to open it, and a whitey-brown paper parcel was held out to her
by a boy in a green canvas round frock, and a pair of round, hard, red, solid-looking cheeks;
no other than Dame Reid's grandson.

"Thank you," said she. "Did Master Alexander give you this?"

"Ay."

"Thank you, that's right!" and away he went.

"You see," said Queen Bee, holding up the parcel to Henrietta, who came out to the porch. "Let
us look. O, they have vouchsafed a note!" and she took out a crumpled envelope, directed in
Aunt Mary's handwriting to Fred, on the back of which Alex had written, "Dear B., we beg pardon,
but Carey and Dick are going up to Andrews's about his terrier.--A. L." "Very cool, certainly!"
said Beatrice, laughing, but still with a little pique. "What a life I will lead them!"

"Well, you were a true prophet," said Henrietta, "and after all it does not much signify. They
have done all the work that is out of reach; but still I thought Fred would have behaved better."

"You have yet to learn the difference between Fred with you or with me, and Fred with his own
congeners," said Beatrice; "you don't know half the phases of boy nature."

Henrietta sighed; for Fred had certainly not been quite what she expected him to-day. Not because
he had appeared to forget her, for that was nothing--that was only appearance, and her love
was too healthy and true even to feel it neglect; but he had forgotten his father's grave.
He was now neglecting the church; and far from its consoling her to hear that it was the way
with all boys when they came together, it gave her one moment's doubt whether they were not
happier, when they were all in all to each other at Rocksand.

It was but for one instant that she felt this impression; the next it had passed away, and
she was sharing the gingerbread with her cousin, and smiling at the great admiration in which
it seemed to be held by the natives of Knight Sutton. They took a short walk up and down the
churchyard while eating it, and then returned to their occupation, well pleased, on re-entering,
to see how much show they had made already. They worked together very happily; indeed, now
that all thought of her squires was quite out of her head, Beatrice worked much more in earnest
and in the right kind of frame; something more of the true spirit of this service came over
her, and she really possessed some of that temper of devotion which she fancied had been with
her the whole day.

Beatrice took up the strain at the first line, and sweetly did their tones echo through the
building; while their hearts swelled with delight and thankfulness for the "good tidings of
great joy." Another and another Christmas hymn was raised, and never were carols sung by happier
voices; and the decorations proceeded all the better and more suitably beneath their influence.
They scarcely knew how time passed away, till Henrietta, turning round, was amazed to see Uncle
Geoffrey standing just within the door watching them.

"Beautiful!" said he, as she suddenly ceased, in some confusion; "your work is beautiful! I
came here prepared to scold you a little, but I don't think I can. Who made that wreath and
Monogram?"

"She did, of course, papa," said Beatrice, pointing to her cousin. "Who else could?"

"It is a very successful arrangement," said Uncle Geoffrey, moving about to find the spot for
obtaining the best view. "It is an arrangement to suggest so much."

Henrietta came to the place where he stood, and for the first time perceived the full effect
of her work. It was placed in front of the altar, the dark crimson covering of which relieved
the shining leaves and scarlet berries of the holly. The three letters, I H S, were in the
centre, formed of small sprays fastened in the required shape; and around them was a large
circle of holly, plaited and twined together, the many-pointed leaves standing out in every
direction in their peculiar stiff gracefulness.

"I see it now!" said she, in a low voice full of awe. "Uncle, I did not mean to make it so!"

"How?" he asked.

"It is like Good Friday!" said she, as the resemblance to the crown of thorns struck her more
and more strongly.

"Well, why not, my dear?" said her uncle, as she shrunk closer to him in a sort of alarm. "Would
Christmas be worth observing if it were not for Good Friday?"

"Yes, it is right uncle; but somehow it is melancholy."

"Where are those verses that say--let me see--

     'And still Thy Church's faith Shall link,
     In all her prayer and praise,
     Thy glory with Thy death.'

So you see, Henrietta, you have been guided to do quite right."

Henrietta gave a little sigh, but did not answer: and Beatrice said, "It is a very odd thing,
whenever any work of art--or, what shall I call it?--is well done, it is apt to have so much
more in it than the author intended. It is so in poetry, painting, and everything else."

"There is, perhaps, more meaning than we understand, when we talk of the spirit in which a
thing is done," said her father: "But have you much more to do? Those columns look very well."

"O, are you come to help us, papa?"

"I came chiefly because grandmamma was a good deal concerned at your not coming home to luncheon.
You must not be out the whole morning again just at present. I have some sandwiches in my pocket
for you."

Beatrice explained how they had been fed, and her papa said, "Very well, we will find some
one who will be glad of them; but mind, do not make her think you unsociable again. Do you
hear and heed?"

It was the sort of tone which, while perfectly kind and gentle, shows that it belongs to a
man who will be obeyed, and ready compliance was promised. He proceeded to give his very valuable
aid at once in taste and execution, the adornment prospered greatly, and when Mr. Franklin
came in, his surprise and delight were excited by the beauty which had grown up in his absence.
The long, drooping, massive wreaths of evergreen at the east end, centring in the crown and
letters; the spiral festoons round the pillars; the sprays in every niche; the tower of holly
over the font--all were more beautiful, both together and singly, than he had even imagined,
and he was profuse in admiration and thanks.

The work was done; and the two Misses Langford, after one well-satisfied survey from the door,
bent their steps homeward, looking forward to the pleasure with which grandpapa and Aunt Mary
would see it to-morrow. As they went in the deepening twilight, the whole village seemed vocal:
children's voices, shrill and tuneless near, but softened by distance, were ringing out here,
there, and everywhere, with

"As shepherds watch'd their flocks by night."

And again, as they walked on, the sound from another band of little voices was brought on the
still frosty wind--

"Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind."

Imperfect rhymes, bad voices, no time observed; but how joyous,--how really Christmas-like--how
well it suited the soft half-light, the last pale shine of sunset lingering in the south-west!
the large solemn stars that one by one appeared! How Uncle Geoffrey caught up the lines and
sang them over to himself! How light and free Beatrice walked!--and how the quiet happy tears
would rise in Henrietta's eyes!

The singing in the drawing-room that evening, far superior as it was, with Henrietta, Beatrice,
Frederick, and even Aunt Mary's beautiful voice, was not equal in enjoyment to that. Was it
because Beatrice was teasing Fred all the time about his defection? The church singers came
up to the Hall, and the drawing-room door was set open for the party to listen to them; grandpapa
and Uncle Geoffrey went out to have a talk with them, and so passed the space till tea-time;
to say nothing of the many little troops of young small voices outside the windows, to whom
Mrs. Langford's plum buns, and Mr. Geoffrey's sixpences, were a very enjoyable part of the
Christmas festivities.

CHAPTER VII.

The double feast of Sunday and Christmas-day dawned upon Henrietta with many anxieties for
her mother, to whom the first going to church must be so great a trial. Would that she could,
as of old, be at her side the whole day! but this privilege, unrecked of at Rocksand, was no
longer hers. She had to walk to church with grandmamma and the rest of the party, while Mrs.
Frederick Langford was driven in the open carriage by old Mr. Langford, and she was obliged
to comfort herself with recollecting that no companion ever suited her better than grandpapa.
It was a sight to be remembered when she came into church, leaning upon his arm, her sweet
expression of peace and resignation, making her even more lovely than when last she entered
there--her face in all its early bloom of youthful beauty, and radiant with innocent happiness.

But Henrietta knew not how to appreciate that "peace which passeth all understanding;" and
all that she saw was the glistening of tears in her eyes, and the heaving of her bosom, as
she knelt down in her place; and she thought that if she had calculated all that she would
have to go through, and all her own anxieties for her, she should never have urged their removal.
She viewed it, however, as a matter of expediency rather than of duty, and her feelings were
not in the only right and wholesome channel. As on the former occasion, Knight Sutton Church
seemed to her more full of her father's presence than of any other, so now, throughout the
service, she was chiefly occupied with watching her mother; and entirely by the force of her
own imagination, she contrived to work herself into a state of nervous apprehension, only equalled
by her mamma's own anxieties for Fred.

Neither she nor any of her young cousins were yet confirmed, so they all left the church together.
What would she not have given to be able to talk her fears over with either Frederick or Beatrice,
and be assured by them that her mamma had borne it very well, and would not suffer from it.
But though neither of them was indifferent or unfeeling, there was not much likelihood of sympathy
from them just at present. Beatrice had always been sure that Aunt Mary would behave like an
angel; and when Fred saw that his mother looked tranquil, and showed no symptoms of agitation,
he dismissed anxiety from his mind, and never even guessed at his sister's alarms.

Nor in reality had he many thoughts for his sister of any kind; for he was, as usual, engrossed
with Queen Bee, criticising the decorations which had been completed in his absence, and, together
with Alex, replying to the scolding with which she visited their desertion.

Nothing could have been more eminently successful than the decorations, which looked to still
greater advantage in the brightness of the morning sun than in the dimness of the evening twilight;
and many were the compliments which the two young ladies received upon their handiwork. The
old women had "never seen nothing like it,"--the school children whispered to each other, "How
pretty!" Uncle Geoffrey and Mr. Franklin admired even more than before; grandpapa and Aunt
Mary were delighted; grandmamma herself allowed it was much better than she had expected; and
Jessie Carey, by way of climax, said it "was like magic."

It was a very different Sunday from those to which Henrietta had been accustomed, in the complete
quiet and retirement of Rocksand. The Hall was so far from the church, that there was but just
time to get back in time for evening service. After which, according to a practice of which
she had often heard her mamma speak with many agreeable reminiscences, the Langford family
almost always went in a body on a progress to the farmyard, to visit the fatting oxen and see
the cows milked.

Mrs. Roger Langford was at home with little Tom, and Mrs. Frederick Langford was glad to seek
the tranquillity and repose of her own apartment; but all the rest went in procession, greatly
to the amusement of Fred and Henrietta, to the large barn-like building, where a narrow path
led them along the front of the stalls of the gentle-looking sweet-breathed cows, and the huge
white-horned oxen.

Uncle Roger, as always happened, monopolised his brother, and kept him estimating the weight
of the great Devon ox, which was next for execution. Grandmamma was escorting Charlie and Arthur
(whom their grandfather was wont to call penultimus and antepenultimus), helping them to feed
the cows with turnips, and guarding them from going behind their heels. Henrietta was extremely
happy, for grandpapa himself was doing the honours for her, and instructing her in the difference
between a Guernsey cow and a short-horn; and so was Alexander, for he had Queen Bee all to
himself in a remote corner of the cow-house, rubbing old spotted Nancy's curly brow, catching
at her polished black-tipped horn, and listening to his hopes and fears for the next half year.
Not so Frederick, as he stood at the door with Jessie Carey, who, having no love for the cow-house,
especially when in her best silk, thought always ready to take care of the children there,
was very glad to secure a companion outside, especially one so handsome, so much more polished
than any of her cousins, and so well able to reply to her small talk. Little did she guess
how far off he wished her, or how he longed to be listening to his uncles, talking to Beatrice,
sticking holly into the cows' halters with John and Richard, scrambling into the hay-loft with
Carey and William--anywhere, rather than be liable to the imputation of being too fine a gentleman
to enter a cow-house.

This accusation never entered the head of any one but himself; but still an attack was in store
for him. After a few words to Martin the cowman, and paying their respects to the pigs, the
party left the farm-yard, and the inhabitants of Sutton Leigh took the path to their own abode,
while Beatrice turned round to her cousin, saying, "Well, Fred, I congratulate you on your
politeness! How well you endured being victimised!"

"I victimised! How do you know I was not enchanted?"

"Nay, you can't deceive me while you have a transparent face. Trust me for finding out whether
you are bored or not. Besides, I would not pay so bad a compliment to your taste as to think
otherwise."

"How do you know I was not exercising the taste of Rubens himself? I was actually admiring
you all, and thinking how like it all was to that great print from one of his pictures; the
building with its dark gloomy roof, and open sides, the twilight, the solitary dispersed snow-flakes,
the haze of dust, the sleek cattle, and their long white horns."

"Quite poetical," said Queen Bee, in a short, dry, satirical manner. "How charmed Jessie must
have been!"

"Why?" said Fred, rather provoked.

"Such masterly eyes are not common among our gentlemen. You will be quite her phoenix; and
how much 'Thomson's Seasons' you will have to hear! I dare say you have had it already--

     'Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind!'"

"Well, very good advice, too," said Fred.

"I hate and detest Thomson," said Beatrice; "above all, for travestying Ruth into 'the lovely
young Lavinia;' so whenever Jessie treated me to any of her quotations, I criticised him without
mercy, and at last I said, by great good luck, that the only use of him was to serve as an
imposition for young ladies at second-rate boarding schools. It was a capital hit, for Alex
found out that it was the way she learnt so much of him, and since that time I have heard no
more of 'Jemmy Thomson! Jemmy Thomson! O!'"

The laughter which followed this speech had a tone in it, which, reaching Mr. Geoffrey Langford,
who was walking a little in front with his mother, made him suspect that the young people were
getting into such spirits as were not quite Sunday-like; and, turning round, he asked them
some trifling question, which made him a party to the conversation, and brought it back to
a quieter, though not less merry tone.

Dinner was at five, and Henrietta was dressed so late that Queen Bee had to come up to summon
her, and bring her down after every one was in the dining-room--an entrée all the more formidable,
because Mr. Franklin was dining there, as well as Uncle Roger and Alexander.

Thanks in some degree to her own dawdling, she had been in a hurry the whole day, and she longed
for a quiet evening: but here it seemed to her, as with the best intentions it usually is,
in a large party, that, but for the laying aside of needlework, of secular books and secular
music, it might as well have been any other day of the week.

Her mamma was very tired, and went to bed before tea, the gentlemen had a long talk over the
fire, the boys and Beatrice laughed and talked, and she helped her grandmamma to hand about
the tea, answering her questions about her mother's health and habits, and heard a good deal
that interested her, but still she could not feel as if it were Sunday. At Rocksand she used
to sit for many a pleasant hour, either in the darkening summer twilight, or the bright red
light of the winter fire, repeating or singing hymns, and enjoying the most delightful talks
that the whole week had to offer, and now she greatly missed the conversation that would have
"set this strange week to rights in her head," as she said to herself.

She thought over it a good deal whilst Bennet was brushing her hair at night, feeling as if
it had been a week-day, and as if it would be as difficult to begin a new fresh week on Monday
morning, as it would a new day after sitting up a whole night. How far this was occasioned
by Knight Sutton habits, and how far it was her own fault, was not what she asked herself,
though she sat up for a long time musing on the change in her way of life, and scarcely able
to believe that it was only last Sunday that she had been sitting with her mother over their
fire at Rocksand. Enough had happened for a whole month. Her darling project was fulfilled;
the airy castle of former days had become a substance, and she was inhabiting it: and was she
really so very much happier? There she went into a reverie--but musing is not meditating, nor
vague dreamings wholesome reflections; she went on sitting their, chiefly for want of energy
to move, till the fire burnt low, the clock struck twelve, and Mrs. Frederick Langford exclaimed
in a sleepy voice, "My dear, are you going to sleep there?"

CHAPTER VIII.

Breakfast was nearly over on Monday morning, when a whole party of the Sutton Leigh boys entered
with the intelligence that the great pond in Knight's Portion was quite frozen over, and that
skating might begin without loss of time.

"You are coming, are you not, Bee?" said Alex, leaning over the back of her chair.

"O yes," said she, nearly whispering "only take care. It is taboo there,"--and she made a sign
with her hand towards Mrs. Langford, "and don't frighten Aunt Mary about Fred. O it is too
late, Carey's doing the deed as fast as he can."

Carey was asking Fred whether he had ever skated, or could skate, and Fred was giving an account
of his exploits in that line at school, hoping it might prove to his mother that he might be
trusted to take care of himself since he had dared the danger before. In vain: the alarmed
expression had come over her face, as she asked Alexander whether his father had looked at the ice.

"No," said Alex, "but it is perfectly safe. I tried it this morning, and it is as firm as this
marble chimney-piece."

"He is pretty well to be trusted," said his grandfather, "more especially as it would be difficult
to get drowned there."

"I would give a shilling to anyone who could drown himself there," said Alex.

"The travelling man did," exclaimed at once Carey, John, and Richard.

"Don't they come in just like the Greek chorus?" said Beatrice, in a whisper to Fred, who gave
a little laugh, but was too anxious to attend to her.

"I thought he was drowned in the river," said Alex.

"No, it was in the deep pool under the weeping willow, where the duckweed grows so rank in
summer," said Carey.

Uncle Geoffrey laughed. "I am sorry to interfere with your romantic embellishments, Carey,
or with the credit of your beloved pond, since you are determined not to leave it behindhand
with its neighbours."

"I always thought it was there," said the boy.

"And thought wrong; the poor man was found in the river two miles off."

"I always heard it was at Knight's Pool," repeated Carey.

"I do not know what you may have heard," said Uncle Geoffrey; "but as it happened a good while
before you were born, I think you had better not argue the point."

"Grandpapa," persisted Carey, "was it not in Knight's Pool?"

"Certainly not," was the answer drily given.

"Well," continued Carey, "I am sure you might drown yourself there."

"Rather than own yourself mistaken," said Uncle Geoffrey.

"Carey, Carey, I hate contradiction," said grandmamma, rising and rustling past where he stood
with a most absurd, dogged, unconvinced face. "Take your arm off the mantelpiece, let that
china cup alone, and stand like a gentleman. Do!"

"All in vain!" said Beatrice. "To the end of his life he will maintain that Knight's Pool drowned
the travelling man!"

"Well, never mind," said John, impatiently, "are we coming to skate this morning or are we not?"

"I really wish," said Aunt Mary, as if she could not help it, "without distrusting either old
Knight's Pool or your judgment, Alexander, that you would ask some one to look at it."

"I should like just to run down and see the fun," said Uncle Geoffrey, thus setting all parties
at rest for the moment. The two girls ran joyfully up to put on their bonnets, as Henrietta
wished to see, Beatrice to join in, the sport. At that instant Mrs. Langford asked her son
Geoffrey to remove some obstacle which hindered the comfortable shutting of the door, and though
a servant might just as well have done it, he readily complied, according to his constant habit
of making all else give way to her, replying to the discomfited looks of the boys, "I shall
be ready by the time the young ladies come down."

So he was, long before Henrietta was ready, and just as she and Beatrice appeared on the stairs,
Atkins was carrying across the hall what the boys looked at with glances of dismay, namely,
the post-bag. Knight Sutton, being small and remote, did not possess a post-office, but a messenger
came from Allonfield for the letters on every day except Sunday, and returned again in the
space of an hour. A very inconvenient arrangement, as everyone had said for the last twenty
years, and might probably say for twenty years more.

As usual, more than half the contents were for G. Langford, Esq., and Fred's face grew longer
and longer as he saw the closely-written business-like sheets.

"Fred, my poor fellow," said his uncle, looking up, "I am sorry for you, but one or two must
be answered by this day's post. I will not be longer than I can help."

"Then do let us come on," exclaimed the chorus.

"Come, Queenie," added Alex.

She delayed, however, saying, "Can I do any good, papa?"

"Thank you, let me see. I do not like to stop you, but it would save time if you could just
copy a letter."

"O thank you, pray let me," said Beatrice, delighted. "Go on, Henrietta, I shall soon come."

Henrietta would have waited, but she saw a chance of speaking to her brother, which she did
not like to lose.

Her mother had taken advantage of the various conversations going on in the hall, to draw her
son aside, saying, "Freddy, I believe you think me very troublesome, but do let me entreat
of you not to venture on the ice till one of your uncles has said it is safe."

"Uncle Roger trusts Alex," said Fred.

"Yes, but he lets all those boys take their chance, and a number of you together are likely
to be careless, and I know there used to be dangerous places in that pond. I will not detain
you, my dear," added she, as the others were preparing to start, "only I beg you will not attempt
to skate till your uncle comes."

"Very well," said Frederick, in a tone of as much annoyance as ever he showed his mother, and
with little suspicion how much it cost her not to set her mind at rest by exacting a promise
from him. This she had resolutely forborne to do in cases like the present, from his earliest
days, and she had her reward in the implicit reliance she could place on his word when once
given. And now, sighing that it had not been voluntarily offered, she went to her sofa, to
struggle and reason in vain with her fears, and start at each approaching step, lest it should
bring the tidings of some fatal accident, all the time blaming herself for the entreaties which
might, as she dreaded, place him in peril of disobedience.

In a few moments Mr. Geoffrey Langford was sitting in the great red leathern chair in the study,
writing as fast as his fingers would move, apparently without a moment for thought, though
he might have said, like the great painter, that what seemed the work of half an hour, was
in fact the labour of years. His daughter, her bonnet by her side, sat opposite to him, writing
with almost equal rapidity, and supremely happy, for to the credit of our little Queen Bee
let it be spoken, that no talk with Henrietta, no walk with grandpapa, no new exciting tale,
no, not even a flirtation with Fred and Alex, one or both, was equal in her estimation to the
pleasure and honour of helping papa, even though it was copying a dry legal opinion, instead
of gliding about on the smooth hard ice, in the bright winter morning's sunshine.

The two pens maintained a duet of diligent scratching for some twenty or five and twenty minutes
without intermission, but at last Beatrice looked up, and without speaking, held up her sheet.

"Already? Thank you, my little clerk, I could think it was mamma. Now then, off to the skating.
My compliments to Fred, and tell him I feel for him, and will not keep him waiting longer than
I can avoid:" and muttering a resumption of his last sentence, on went the lawyer's indefatigable
pen; and away flew the merry little Busy Bee, bounding off with her droll, tripping, elastic,
short-stepped run, which suited so well with her little alert figure, and her dress, a small
plain black velvet bonnet, a tight black velvet "jacket," as she called it, and a brown silk
dress, with narrow yellow stripes (chosen chiefly in joke, because it was the colour of a bee),
not a bit of superfluous shawl, boa, or ribbon about her, but all close and compact, fit for
the diversion which she was eager to enjoy. The only girl among so many boys, she had learnt
to share in many of their sports, and one of the prime favourites was skating, a diversion
which owes as much of its charm to the caprices of its patron Jack Frost, as to the degree
of skill which it requires.

She arrived at the stile leading to "Knight's Portion," as it was called, and a very barren
portion must the poor Knight have possessed if it was all his property. It was a sloping chalky
field or rather corner of a down, covered with very short grass and thistles, which defied
all the attacks of Uncle Roger and his sheep. On one side was a sort of precipice, where the
chalk had been dug away, and a rather extensive old chalk pit formed a tolerable pond, by the
assistance of the ditch at the foot of a hedge. $ 3.00, cyberspace.

 At
first she had occupation enough in attending to her own security to bestow any attention on
other things, but in less than a quarter of an hour, she began to feel at her ease, and her
spirits rising to the pitch where consideration is lost, she "could not help," in her own phrase,
laughing at the disconsolate Fred.

"How woebegone he looks!" said she, as she whisked past, "but never mind, Fred, the post must
go some time or other."

"It must be gone," said Fred. "I am sure we have been here above an hour!"

"Henrietta looks blue with cold, like an old hen obliged to follow her ducklings to the water!"
observed Beatrice, again gliding near, and in the midst of her next circular sweep she chanted--

"Although their feet are pointed, and my feet are round, Pray, is that any reason why I should
be drowned?"

It was a great aggravation of Fred's calamities to be obliged to laugh, nor were matters mended
by the sight of the party now advancing from the house, Jessie Carey, with three of the lesser
boys.

"What news of Uncle Geoffrey?"

"I did not see him," said Jessie: "I think he was in the study, Uncle Roger went to him there."

"No hope then!" muttered the unfortunate Fred.

"Can't you skate, Fred?" asked little Arthur with a certain most provoking face of wonder and
curiosity.

"Presently," said Fred.

"He must not," cried Richard, in a tone which Fred thought malicious, though it was only rude.

"Must not?" and Arthur looked up in amazement to the boy so much taller than his three brothers,
creatures in his eyes privileged to do what they pleased.

"His mamma won't let him," was Dick's polite answer. Fred could have knocked him down with
the greatest satisfaction, but in the first place he was out of reach, in the second, the young
ladies were present, in the third he was a little boy, and a stupid one, and Fred had temper
enough left to see that there would be nothing gained by quarrelling with him, so contenting
himself with a secret but most ardent wish that he had him as his fag at school, he turned
to Jessie, and asked her what she thought of the weather, if the white frost would bring rain,
&c., &c.

Jessie thought the morning too bright not to be doubtful, and the hoar frost was so very thick
and white that it was not likely to continue much longer.

"How beautiful these delicate white crests are to every thorn in the hedge!" said Henrietta;
"and look, these pieces of chalk are almost cased in glass."

"O I do love such a sight!" said Jessie. "Here is a beautiful bit of stick crusted over."

"It is a perfect little Giant's Causeway," said Henrietta; "do look at these lovely little
columns, Fred."

"Ah!" said Jessie, "Myriads of little salts, or hook'd or shaped like double wedges.--"

She thought Beatrice safe out of hearing, but that very moment by she came, borne swiftly along,
and catching the cadence of that one line, looked archly at Fred, and shaped with her lips
rather than uttered--"O Jemmy Thomson! Jemmy Thomson, O!"

It filled up the measure. That Beatrice, Alexander and Chorus should be making him a laughing-stock,
and him pinned to Miss Carey's side, was more than he could endure. He had made up his mind
that Uncle Geoffrey was not coming at all, his last feeble hold of patience and obedience gave
way, and he exclaimed, "Well, I shan't wait any longer, it is not of the least use."

"O, Fred, consider!" said his sister.

"That's right, Freddy," shouted Carey, "he'll not come now, I'll answer for it."

"You know he promised he would," pleaded Henrietta.

"Uncle Roger has got hold of him, and he is as bad as the old man of the sea," said Fred, "the
post has been gone this half-hour, and I shall not wait any longer."

"Think of mamma."

"How can you talk such nonsense, Henrietta?" exclaimed Fred impatiently, "do you think that
I am so awfully heavy that the ice that bears them must needs break with me?"

"I do not suppose there is any danger," said Henrietta, "but for the sake of poor mamma's entreaties!"

"Do you think I am going to be kept in leading-strings all the rest of my life?" said Fred,
obliged to work himself into a passion in order to silence his sister and his conscience. "I
have submitted to such absurd nonsense a great deal too long already, I will not be made a
fool of in the sight of everybody; so here goes!"

And breaking away from her detaining arm, he ran down to the verge of the pond, and claimed
the skates which he had lent to John. Henrietta turned away her eyes full of tears.

"Never mind, Henrietta," shouted the good-natured Alexander, "I'll engage to fish him out if
he goes in."

"It is as likely I may fish you out, Mr. Alex," returned Fred, slightly affronted.

"Or more likely still there will be no fishing in the case," said the naughty little Syren,
who felt all the time a secret satisfaction in the consciousness that it was she who had made
the temptation irresistible, then adding, to pacify Henrietta and her own feelings of compunction,
"Aunt Mary must be satisfied when she hears with what exemplary patience he waited till papa
was past hope, and the pond past fear."

Whether Alex smiled at the words "past fear," or whether Fred only thought he did, is uncertain,
the effect was that he exclaimed, "I only wish there was a place in this pond that you did
not like to skate over, Alex."

"Well, there is one," said Alex, laughing, "where Carey drowns the travelling man: there is
a spring there, and the ice is never so firm, so you may try--"

"Don't, Fred--I beg you won't!" cried Beatrice.

"O, Fred, Fred, think, think, if anything should happen!" implored Henrietta.

"I shan't look, I can't bear it!" exclaimed Jessie, turning away.

Fred without listening skated triumphantly towards the hedge, and across the perilous part,
and fortunately it was without disaster. In the middle of the shout of applause with which
the chorus celebrated his achievement, a gate in the hedge suddenly opened, and the two uncles
stood before them. The first thing Uncle Geoffrey did was to take a short run, and slide right
across the middle of the pond, while Uncle Roger stood by laughing and saying, "Well done,
Geoffrey, you are not quite so heavy as I am."

Uncle Geoffrey reaching the opposite side, caught up little Charley by the arms and whirled
him round in the air, then shouted in a voice that had all the glee and blithe exultation of
a boy just released from school, "I hereby certify to all whom it may concern, the pond is
franked! Where's Fred?"

Fred wished himself anywhere else, and so did Henrietta. Even Queen Bee's complacency gave
way before her father, and it was only Alexander who had spirit to answer, "We thought you
were not coming at all."

"Indeed!" said Uncle Geoffrey; and little Willy exclaimed, "Why, Alex, Uncle Geoffrey always
comes when he promises," a truth to which every one gave a mental assent.

Without taking the smallest notice of Frederick by word or look, Uncle Geoffrey proceeded to
join the other boys, to the great increase of their merriment, instructing them in making figures
of eight, and in all the other mysteries of the skating art, which they could scarcely enjoy
more than he seemed to do. Henrietta, cold and unhappy, grieved at her brother's conduct, and
still more grieved at the displeasure of her uncle, wished to return to the house, yet could
not make up her mind to do so, for fear of her mamma's asking about Fred; and whilst she was
still doubting and hesitating, the Church bell began to ring, reminding her of the saint's
day service, one of the delights of Knight Sutton to which she had so long looked forward.
Yet here was another disappointment. The uncles and the two girls immediately prepared to go.
Jessie said she must take Arthur and Charley home, and set off. The boys could do as they pleased,
and Willy holding Uncle Geoffrey's hand was going with him, but the rest continued their sport,
and among them was Fred. He had never disobeyed a Church bell before, and had rather not have
done so now, but as he saw none of his male companions setting off, he fancied that to attend
a week-day service in the holidays might be reckoned a girlish proceeding, imagined his cousins
laughing at him as soon as his back was turned, and guessed from Uncle Geoffrey's grave looks
that he might be taken to task when no longer protected by the presence of the rest.

He therefore replied with a gruff short "No" to his sister's anxious question whether he was
not coming, and flourished away to the other end of the pond; but a few seconds after he was
not a little surprised and vexed at finding himself mistaken after all--at least so far as
regarded Alex, who had been only going on with his sport to the last moment, and now taking
off his skates, vaulted over the gate, and ran at full speed after the rest of the party, overtaking
them before they reached the village.

Henrietta was sadly disappointed when, looking round at the sound of footsteps, she saw him
instead of her brother. His refusal to go to Church grieved her more than his disobedience,
on which she did not in general look with sufficient seriousness, and for which in the present
case there were many extenuating circumstances, which she longed to plead to Uncle Geoffrey,
who would, she thought, relax in his severity towards her poor Fred, if he knew how long he
had waited, and how much he had been teased. This, however, she could not tell him without
complaining of his daughter, and in fact it was an additional pain that Queen Bee should have
used all her powerful influence in the wrong direction.

It was impossible to be long vexed with the little Busy Bee, even in such circumstances as
these, especially when she came up to her, put her arm into hers, and looked into her face
with all the sweetness that could sometimes reside in those brown features of hers, saying,
"My poor Henrietta, I am afraid we have been putting you to torture all this time, but you
know that it is quite nonsense to be afraid of anything happening."

"O yes, I know that, but really, Queenie, you should not have persuaded him."

 It is vanity, and I will try
to subdue it."

Beatrice had a sort of candid way of reasoning about her faults, and would blame herself, and
examine her motives in a manner which disarmed reproof by forestalling it. She was perfectly
sincere, yet it was self-deception, for it was not as if it was herself whom she was analysing,
but rather as if it was some character in a book; indeed, she would have described herself
almost exactly as she is here described, except that her delineation would have been much more
clever and more exact. She would not have spared herself--for this reason, that her own character
was more a study to her than a reality, her faults rather circumstances than sins; it was her
mind, rather than her soul, that reflected and made resolutions, or more correctly, what would
have been resolutions, if they had possessed any real earnestness, and not been done, as it
were, mechanically, because they became the occasion.

The conversation was concluded by the sound of the luncheon bell, and she ran up to take off
her bonnet, her thoughts taking the following course: "I am very sorry; it is too bad to tease
poor Fred, cruel and wrong, and all that, only if he would not look absurd! It is too droll
to see how provoked he is, when I take the least notice of Alex, and after all, I don't think
he cares for me half as much as Alex does, only it flatters his vanity. Those great boys are
really quite as vain as girls, not Alex though, good downright fellow, who would do anything
for me, and I have put him to a hard proof to-night. What a capital thought those charades
are! Fred will meet the others on common, nay, on superior ground, and there will be none of
these foolish questions who can be most manly mad. Fred is really a fine spirited fellow though,
and I thought papa could not find it in his heart to be angry with him. How capitally he will
act, and how lovely Henrietta will look! I must make them take to the charades, it will be
so very delightful, and keep Fred quite out of mischief, which will set Aunt Mary at ease.
And how amused grandpapa will be! What shall it be to-night? What Alex can manage to act tolerably.
Ce n'est que le premier pas qui conte, and the premier pas must be with our best foot foremost.
I give myself credit for the thought; it will make all smooth."

These meditations occupied her during a hasty toilette and a still more rapid descent, and
were abruptly concluded by her alighting from her swinging jump down the last four steps close
to Fred himself, who was standing by the hall fire with a gloomy expression of countenance,
which with inconsiderate good nature she hastened to remove. "Don't look dismal, Freddy; I
have told papa all about it, and he does not mind it. Cheer up, you adventurous knight, I have
some glorious fun for you this evening."

Not mind it! The impression thus conveyed to one but too willing to receive it, was that Uncle
Geoffrey, that external conscience, thought him excused from attending to unreasonable prohibitions.
Away went all the wholesome self-reproach which he had begun to feel, away went all fear of
Uncle Geoffrey's eye, all compunction in meeting his mother, and he entered the dining-room
in such lively spirits that his uncle was vexed to see him so unconcerned, and his mother felt
sure that her entreaty had not been disregarded. She never heard to the contrary, for she liked
better to trust than to ask questions, and he, like far too many boys, did not think concealment
blameable where there was no actual falsehood.

All the time they were at table, Queen Bee was in one of her states of wild restlessness, and
the instant she was at liberty she flew away, and was seen no more that afternoon, except in
certain flittings into different apartments, where she appeared for a moment or two with some
extraordinary and mysterious request. First she popped upon grandpapa, and with the expense
of a little coaxing and teasing, obtained from him the loan of his Deputy-Lieutenant's uniform;
then she darted into the drawing-room, on hearing Uncle Roger's voice, and conjured him not
to forget to give a little note to Alex, containing these words, "Willy must wear his cap without
a peak. Bring Roger's dirk, and above all, beg, borrow, or steal, Uncle Roger's fishing boots."
Her next descent was upon Aunt Mary, in her own room: "Aunt, would you do me a great favour,
and ask no questions, nor tell Henrietta? Do just lend me the three little marabout feathers
which you had in your cap yesterday evening. Only for this one evening, and I'll take great care."

"I am sure, my dear, you are very welcome to them; I do not feel like myself in such finery,"
said Mrs. Frederick Langford, smiling, as Beatrice took possession of the elegant little white
cap, which she had the discretion to carry to Bennet, its lawful protector, to be bereft of
its plumed honours. Bennet, an old friend of nursery days, was in the secret of her plans for
the evening; her head-quarters were in the work-room, which had often served her as a playroom
in days gone by, and Judith, gratified by a visit from "Miss Bee," dived for her sake into
boxes and drawers, amid hoards where none but Judith would have dared to rummage.

All this might ultimately be for Henrietta's entertainment, but at present it did not much
conduce towards it, as she was left to her own resources in the drawing-room. She practised
a little, worked a little, listened to a consultation between grandpapa and Uncle Roger, about
the new pig-sty, wrote it down in her list when they went into the study to ask Uncle Geoffrey's
advice, tried to talk over things in general with her mamma, but found it impossible with grandmamma
continually coming in and out of the room, yawned, wondered what Busy Bee was about, felt deserted,
gave up work, and had just found an entertaining book, when grandmamma came in, and invited
her to visit the poultry yard. She readily accepted, but for want of Queen Bee to hurry her,
kept her grandmamma waiting longer than she liked, and had more of a scolding than was agreeable.
The chickens were all gone to roost by the time they arrived, the cock just peering down at
them with his coral-bordered eye, and the ducks waddling stealthily in one by one, the feeding
was over, the hen-wife gone, and Mrs. Langford vexed at being too late.

Henrietta was annoyed with herself and with the result of the day, but she had some consolation,
for as they were going towards the house, they met Mr. Langford, who called out, "So you have
been walking with grandmamma! Well, if you are not tired, come and have a little turn with
grandpapa. I am going to speak to Daniels, the carpenter, and my 'merry Christmas' will be
twice as welcome to his old father, if I take you with me."

Henrietta might be a little tired, but such an invitation was not to be refused, and she was
at her grandpapa's side in an instant, thanking him so much that he laughed and said the favour
was to him. "I wish we had Fred here too," said he, as they walked on, "the old man will be
very glad to see you."

"Was he one of mamma's many admirers in the village?"

"All the village admired Miss Mary, but it was your father who was old Daniels' chief friend.
The boys used to have a great taste for carpentry, especially your father, who was always at
his elbow when he was at work at the Hall. Poor old man, I thought he would never have held
up his head again when our great trouble came on us. He used to touch his hat, and turn away
without looking me in the face. And there you may see stuck up over the chimney-piece in his
cottage the new chisel that your father gave him when he had broken his old one."

"Dear old man!" said Henrietta, warmly, "I am so very glad that we have come here, where people
really care for us, and are interested in us, and not for our own sake. How delightful it is!
I feel as if we were come out of banishment."

"Well, it is all the better for you," said Mr. Langford; "if we had had you here, depend upon
it, we should have spoilt you. We have so few granddaughters that we cannot help making too
much of them. There is that little Busy Bee--by the by, what is her plan this evening, or are
not you in her secret?"

"O no, I believe she is to surprise us all. I met her just before I came out dragging a huge
bag after her: I wanted to help her, but she would not let me."

"She turns us all round her finger," said grandpapa. "I never found the person who could resist
Queen Bee, except grandmamma. But I am glad you do not take after her, Henrietta, for one such
grandchild is enough, and it is better for woman-kind to have leadable spirits than leading."

"O, grandpapa!"

"That is a dissentient O. What does it mean? Out with it."

"Only that I was thinking about weakness; I beg your pardon, grandpapa."

"Look here!" and Mr. Langford bent the slender cane in his hand (he disdained a stronger walking-stick)
to its full extent of suppleness. "Is this weak?"

"No, it is strong in energy," said Henrietta, laughing, as the elastic cane sprang back to
its former shape.

"Yet to a certain point you can bend it as far as you please. Well, that should be the way
with you: be turned any way but the wrong, and let your own determination be only to keep upright."

"But women are admired for influence."

"Influence is a good thing in its way, but only of a good sort when it is unconscious. At any
rate, when you set to work to influence people, take care it is only with a view to their good,
and not to your own personal wishes, or influencing becomes a dangerous trade, especially for
young ladies towards their elders."

Grandpapa, who had only seen Henrietta carried about by Beatrice, grandmamma, or Fred, and
willing to oblige them all, had little idea how applicable to her case was his general maxim,
nor indeed did she at the moment take it to herself, although it was one day to return upon
her. It brought them to the neat cottage of the carpenter, with the thatched workshop behind,
and the garden in front, which would have looked neat but for the melancholy aspect of the
frost-bitten cabbages.

This was Henrietta's first cottage visit, and she was all eagerness and interest, picturing
to herself a venerable old man, almost as fine-looking as her grandfather, and as eloquent
as old men in cottages always are in books; but she found it rather a disappointing meeting.
It was a very nice trim-looking daughter-in-law who opened the door, on Mr. Langford's knock,
and the room was neatness itself, but the old carpenter was not at all what she had imagined.
He was a little stooping old man, with a shaking head, and weak red eyes under a green shade,
and did not seem to have anything to say beyond "Yes, sir," and "Thank you, sir," when Mr.
Langford shouted into his deaf ears some of the "compliments of the season." Looking at the
young lady, whom he evidently mistook for Beatrice, he hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey were
quite well. His face lighted up a little for a moment when Mr. Langford told him this was Mr.
Frederick's daughter, but it was only for an instant, and in a somewhat querulous voice he
asked if there was not a young gentleman too.

"O yes," said Mr. Langford, "he shall come and see you some day."

"He would not care to see a poor old man," said Daniels, turning a little away, while his daughter-in-law
began to apologise for him by saying, "He is more lost than usual to-day, sir; I think it was
getting tired going to church, yesterday morning; he did not sleep well, and he has been so
fretful all the morning, a body did not know what to do with him."

Mr. Langford said a few more cheerful words to the poor old man, then asked the daughter where
her husband was, and, hearing that he was in the workshop, refused offers of fetching him in,
and went out to speak to him, leaving Henrietta to sit by the fire and wait for him. A weary
waiting time she found it; shy as she was of poor people, as of a class with whom she was utterly
unacquainted, feeling bound to make herself agreeable, but completely ignorant how to set about
it, wishing to talk to the old man, and fearing to neglect him, but finding conversation quite
impossible except with Mrs. Daniels, and not very easy with her--she tried to recollect what
storied young ladies did say to old men, but nothing she could think of would do, or was what
she could find herself capable of saying. At last she remembered, in "Gertrude," the old nurse's
complaint that Laura did not inquire after the rheumatism, and she hazarded her voice in expressing
a hope that Mr. Daniels did not suffer from it. Clear as the sweet voice was, it was too tremulous
(for she was really in a fright of embarrassment) to reach the old man's ear, and his daughter-in-law
took it upon her to repeat the inquiry in a shrill sharp scream, that almost went through her
ears; then while the old man was answering something in a muttering maundering way, she proceeded
with a reply, and told a long story about his ways with the doctor, in her Sussex dialect,
almost incomprehensible to Henrietta. The conversation dropped, until Mrs. Daniels began hoping
that every one at the Hall was quite well, and as she inquired after them one by one, this
took up a reasonable time; but then again followed a silence. Mrs. Daniels was not a native
of Knight Sutton, or she would have had more to say about Henrietta's mother; but she had never
seen her before, and had none of that interest in her that half the parish felt. Henrietta
wished there had been a baby to notice, but she saw no trace in the room of the existence of
children, and did not like to ask if there were any. She looked at the open hearth, and said
it was very comfortable, and was told in return that it made a great draught, and smoked very
much. Then she bethought herself of admiring an elaborately worked frame sampler, that hung
against the wall; and the conversation this supplied lasted her till, to her great joy, grandpapa
made his appearance again, and summoned her to return, as it was already growing very dark.

She thought he might have made something of an apology for the disagreeableness of his friend;
but, being used to it, and forgetting that she was not, he did no such thing; and she was wondering
that cottage visiting could ever have been represented as so pleasant an occupation, when he
began on a far more interesting subject, asking about her mother's health, and how she thought
Knight Sutton agreed with her, saying how very glad he was to have her there again, and how
like his own daughter she had always been. He went on to tell of his first sight of his two
daughters-in-law, when, little guessing that they would be such, he went to fetch home the
little Mary Vivian, who had come from India under the care of General St. Leger. "There they
were," said he; "I can almost see them now, as their black nurse led them in; your aunt a brown
little sturdy thing, ready to make acquaintance in a moment, and your mamma such a fair, shrinking,
fragile morsel of a child, that I felt quite ashamed to take her among all my great scrambling
boys."

"Ah! mamma says her recollection is all in bits and scraps; she recollects the ship, and she
remembers sitting on your knee in a carriage; but she cannot remember either the parting with
Aunt Geoffrey or the coming here."

"I do not remember about the parting with Aunt Geoffrey; they managed that in the nursery,
I believe, but I shall never forget the boys receiving her,--Fred and Geoffrey, I mean,--for
Roger was at school. How they admired her like some strange curiosity, and played with her
like a little girl with a new doll. There was no fear that they would be too rough with her,
for they used to touch her as if she was made of glass. And what a turn out of old playthings
there was in her service!"

"That was when she was six," said Henrietta, "and papa must have been ten."

"Yes, thereabouts, and Geoffrey a year younger. How they did pet her! and come down to all
their old baby-plays again for her sake, till I was almost afraid that cricket and hockey would
be given up and forgotten."

"And were they?"

"No, no, trust boys for that. Little Mary came to be looker on, if she did not sometimes play
herself. She was distressed damsel, and they knight and giant, or dragon, or I cannot tell
what, though many's the time I have laughed over it. Whatever they pleased was she: never lived
creature more without will of her own."

"Never," responded Henrietta; but that for which Mr. Langford might commend his little Mary
at seven years old, did not appear so appropriate a subject of observation in Mrs. Frederick
Langford, and by her own daughter.

"Eh!" said her grandfather. Then answering his mental objection in another tone, "Ay, ay, no
will for her own pleasure; that depends more on you than on any one else."

"I would do anything on earth for her!" said Henrietta, feeling it from the bottom of her heart.

"I am sure you would, my dear," said Mr. Langford, "and she deserves it. There are few like
her, and few that have gone through so much. To think of her as she was when last she was here
and to look at her now! Well, it won't do to talk of it; but I thought when I saw her face
yesterday, that I could see, as well as believe, it was all for the best for her, as I am sure
it was for us."

He was interrupted just as they reached the gate by the voice of his eldest son calling "Out
late, sir," and looking round, Henrietta saw what looked in the darkness like a long procession,
Uncle and Aunt Roger, and their niece, and all the boys, as far down as William, coming to
the Hall for the regular Christmas dinner-party.

Joining company, Henrietta walked with Jessie and answered her inquiries whether she had got
wet or cold in the morning; but it was in an absent manner, for she was all the time dwelling
on what her grandfather had been saying. She was calling up in imagination the bright scenes
of her mother's youth; those delightful games of which she had often heard, and which she could
place in their appropriate setting now that she knew the scenes. She ran up to her room, where
she found only Bennet, her mother having dressed and gone down; and sitting down before the
fire, and resigning her curls to her maid, she let herself dwell on the ideas the conversation
had called up, turning from the bright to the darker side. She pictured to herself the church,
the open grave, her uncles and her grandfather round it, the villagers taking part in their
grief, the old carpenter's averted head--she thought what must have been the agony of the moment,
of laying in his untimely grave one so fondly loved, on whom the world was just opening so
brightly,--and the young wife--the infant children--how fearful it must have been! "It was
almost a cruel dispensation," thought Henrietta. "O, how happy and bright we might have been!
What would it not have been to hold by his hand, to have his kiss, to look for his smile! And
mamma, to have had her in all her joyousness and blitheness, with no ill health, and no cares!
O, why was it not so? And yet grandpapa said it was for the best! And in what a manner he did
say it, as if he really felt and saw, and knew the advantage of it! To dear papa himself I
know it was for the best, but for us, mamma, grandpapa--no, I never shall understand it. They
were good before; why did they need punishment? Is this what is called saying 'Thy will be
done?' Then I shall never be able to say it, and yet I ought!"

"Your head a little higher, if you please, Miss Henrietta," said Bennet; "it is that makes
me so long dressing you, and your mamma has been telling me that I must get you ready faster."

Henrietta slightly raised her head for the moment, but soon let it sink again in her musings,
and when Bennet reminded her, replied, "I can't, Bennet, it breaks my neck." Her will was not
with her mother's, in a trifling matter of which the reasonableness could not but approve itself
to her. How, then, was it likely to be bent to that of her Heavenly Parent, in what is above
reason?

The toilet was at length completed, and in time for her to be handed in to dinner by Alexander,
an honour which she owed to Beatrice having already been secured by Frederick, who was resolved
not to be again abandoned to Jessie. Alex did not favour her with much conversation, partly
because he was thinking with perturbation of the task set him for the evening, and partly because
he was trying to hear what Queen Bee was saying to Fred, in the midst of the clatter of knives
and forks, and the loud voice of Mr. Roger Langford, which was enough to drown most other sounds.
Some inquiries had been made about Mrs. Geoffrey Langford and her aunt, Lady Susan St. Leger,
which had led Beatrice into a great lamentation for her mother's absence, and from thence into
a description of what Lady Susan exacted from her friends. "Aunt Susan is a regular fidget,"
said she; "not such a fidget as some people," with an indication of Mrs. Langford. "Some people
are determined to make others comfortable in a way of their own, and that is a fidget to be
regarded with considerable respect; but Aunt Susan's fidgeting takes the turn of sacrificing
the comfort of every one else to her own and her little dog's."

"But that is very hard on Aunt Geoffrey," said Fred.

"Frightfully. Any one who was less selfish would have insisted on mamma's coming here, instead
of which Aunt Susan only complains of her sister and brother, and everybody else, for going
out of London, when she may be taken suddenly ill at any time. She is in such a nervous state
that Mr. Peyton cannot tell what might be the consequence," said Beatrice, in an imitative
tone, which made Fred laugh.

"I am sure I should leave her to take care of herself," said he.

"So do the whole family except ourselves; they are all worn out by her querulousness, and are
not particularly given to patience or unselfishness either. But mamma is really fond of her,
because she was kind to her when she came home from India, and she manages to keep her quiet
better than anyone else can. She can very seldom resist mamma's cheerful voice, which drives
off half her nerves at once. You cannot think how funny it is to see how Aunt Amelia always
seems to stroke the cat the wrong way, and mamma to smooth her down the right."

A lull in the conversation left these last words audible, and Mr. Langford said, "What is that
about stroking the cat, Queenie?"

"O you are telling it all--O don't, Bee!" cried Willy.

And with certain jokes about cats and bags, which seemed excessively to discomfit Willy, who
protested the cat was not in the bag at all--it was the partridges--the conversation drifted
away again from the younger party.

As soon as dinner was over, Beatrice again disappeared, after begging her grandmamma to allow
the great Indian screen to remain as it at present stood, spread out so as to cut off one end
of the room, where there was a door opening into the study. Behind this screen frequent rustlings
were heard, with now and then a burst of laughing or whispering, and a sound of moving furniture,
which so excited Mrs. Langford, that, starting up, she exclaimed that she must go and see what
they were doing.

"We are taking great care, grandmamma," called Alexander. "We won't hurt it."

This, by showing so far that there was something to be hurt, was so far from reassuring her,
that she would certainly have set out on a voyage of discovery, but for Mr. Langford, who professed
himself convinced that all was right, and said he would not have the Busy Bee disturbed.

She came in to tea, bringing Alex and Willy with her--the latter, in a marvellous state of
mystery and excitement, longing to tell all himself, and yet in great terror lest the others
should tell.

As soon as the tea was despatched, the three actors departed, and presently there was a call
from behind the screen, "Are you ready, good people?"

"Go it," answered Carey.

"Are the elders ready?" said Beatrice's voice.

"Papa, don't go on talking to Uncle Geoffrey!" cried Willy.

"Ay, ay, all attention," said grandpapa. "Now for it!"

The screen was folded back, and discovered Alex in a pasteboard crown, ermine tippet, and purple
mantle, sitting enthroned with Beatrice (a tiara and feathers on her head) at his side, and
kneeling before them a nondescript article, consisting chiefly of a fur cloak, a fur cap, adorned
with a pair of grey squirrel cuffs, sewn ingeniously into the form of ears, a boa by way of
tail, and an immense pair of boots. As Uncle Geoffrey said, the cat was certainly out of the
bag, and it proceeded in due form to take two real partridges from the bag, and present them
to the king and princess in the name of the Marquis Carabbas.

The king and princess made some consultation as to who the marquis might be, the princess proposing
to send for the Peerage, and the king cross-examining puss in an incredulous way which greatly
puzzled him, until at last he bethought himself of exclaiming, in a fierce manner, "I've told
you the truth, Mr. King, and if you won't believe me, I can't help it!" and walked off on his
hind legs in as dignified and resentful a manner as his boots would let him; repairing to the
drawing-room to have his accoutrements admired, while the screen was again spread in preparation
for Scene II.

Scene II. presented but a half-length, a shawl being hung in front, so as to conceal certain
incongruities. A great arm-chair was wheeled close to the table, on which stood an aged black
jack out of the hall, a quart measure, and a silver tankard; while in the chair, a cushion
on his head, and a great carving-knife held like a sceptre in his hand, reclined Alex, his
bulk enlarged by at least two pillows, over which an old, long-breasted white satin waistcoat,
embroidered with silver, had with some difficulty been brought to meet. Before him stood a
little figure in a cloth cap, set jauntily on one side, decorated with a fox's brush, and with
Mrs. Frederick Langford's three feathers, and a coat bearing marvellous resemblance to Beatrice's
own black velvet spencer, crossed over one shoulder by a broad blue ribbon, which Henrietta
knew full well. "Do thou stand for my father," began this droll little shape, "and examine
me in the particulars of my life."

It was not badly carried out; Prince Henry, when he did not giggle, acted beautifully; and
Falstaff really did very well, though his eyes were often directed downwards, and the curious,
by standing on tiptoe, obtained not only a view of Prince Hal's pink petticoat, but of a great
Shakespeare laid open on the floor; and a very low bow on the part of the heir apparent, when
about to change places with his fat friend, was strongly suspected of being for the purpose
of turning over a leaf. It was with great spirit that the parting appeal was given, "Banish
fat Jack, and banish all the world!" And there was great applause when fat Jack and Prince
Hal jumped up and drew the screen forward again; though Uncle Geoffrey and Aunt Mary were cruel
enough to utter certain historical and antiquarian doubts as to whether the Prince of Wales
was likely to wear the three feathers and ribbon of the garter in his haunts at Eastcheap.

In the concluding scene the deputy lieutenant's uniform made a great figure, with the addition
of the long-breasted waistcoat, a white scarf, and the white cockade, adorning Alex, who, with
a boot-jack under his arm, looked as tall and as rigid as he possibly could, with a very low
bow, which was gracefully returned by a royal personage in a Scottish bonnet, also bearing
the white cockade, a tartan scarf, and the blue ribbon. Altogether, Prince Charles Edward and
the Baron of Bradwardine stood confessed; the character was solemnly read, and the shoe pulled
off, or supposed to be, as the lower screen still remained to cut off the view; and then the
Baron indulged in a lengthy yawn and stretch, while Prince Charlie, skipping into the midst
of the audience, danced round Mr. Langford, asking if he had guessed it.

CHAPTER X.

Beatrice had not judged amiss when she thought charade-acting an amusement likely to take the
fancy of her cousins. The great success of her boot-jack inspired both Frederick and Henrietta
with eagerness to imitate it; and nothing was talked of but what was practicable in the way
of scenes, words, and decorations. The Sutton Leigh party were to dine at the Hall again on
Thursday, and it was resolved that there should be a grand charade, with all the splendour
that due preparation could bestow upon it. "It was such an amusement to grandpapa," as Beatrice
told Henrietta, "and it occupied Fred so nicely," as she said to her father; both which observations
being perfectly true, Mr. Geoffrey Langford was very willing to promote the sport, and to tranquillise
his mother respecting the disarrangement of her furniture.

But what should the word be? Every one had predilections of their own--some for comedy, others
for tragedy; some for extemporary acting, others for Shakespeare. Beatrice, with her eye for
drawing, already grouped her dramatis personae, so as to display Henrietta's picturesque face
and figure to the greatest advantage, and had designs of making her and Fred represent Catherine
and Henry Seyton, whom, as she said, she had always believed to be exactly like them. Fred
was inclined for "another touch at Prince Hal," and devised numerous ways of acting Anonymous,
for the sake of "Anon, anon, sir." Henrietta wanted to contrive something in which Queen Bee
might appear as an actual fairy bee, and had very pretty visions of making her a beneficent
spirit in a little fanciful opera, for which she had written three or four verses, when Fred
put an end to it be pronouncing it "nonsense and humbug."

So passed Tuesday, without coming to any decision, and Henrietta was beginning to fear that
they would never fix at all, when on Wednesday morning Beatrice came down in an ecstasy with
the news, that by some chance a wig of her papa's was in the house, and a charade they must
and would have which would bring in the wig. "Come and see it," said she, drawing her two cousins
into the study after breakfast: the study being the safest place for holding counsel on these
secret subjects. "There now, is it not charming? O, a law charade we must have, that is certain!"

Fred and Henrietta, who had never chanced to see a barrister's wig before, were greatly diverted
with its little tails, and tried it on in turn. While Henrietta was in the midst of her laugh
at the sight of her own fair ringlets hanging out below the tight grey rolls, the door suddenly
opened, and gave entrance to its owner, fiercely exclaiming, "What! nothing safe from you,
you impertinent kittens?"

"O, Uncle Geoffrey, I beg your pardon!" cried Henrietta, blushing crimson.

"Don't take it off till I have looked at you," said Uncle Geoffrey. "Why, you would make a
capital Portia!"

"Yes, yes!" cried Queen Bee, "that is it: Portia she shall be, and I'll be Nerissa."

"Oh, no, Queenie, I could never be Portia!" said Henrietta: "I am sure I can't."

"But I have set my heart on being the 'little scrubby lawyer's clerk,'" said Busy Bee; "it
is what I am just fit for; and let me see--Fred shall be Antonio, and that will make you plead
from your very heart, and you shall have Alex for your Bassanio."

"But the word. Do you mean to make it fit in with Falstaff and Catherine Seyton?" said Henrietta.

"Let me see," said Beatrice; "bond--bondage, jew--jeweller, juniper,--"

"Lawsuit," said Fred. "Ay, don't you see, all the scenes would come out of the 'Merchant of
Venice.' There is 'law' when the old Jew is crying out for his ducats, and--but halloo!" and
Fred stood aghast at the sight of his uncle, whose presence they had all forgotten in their
eagerness.

"Traitor!" said Beatrice; "but never mind, I believe we must have let him into the plot, for
nobody else can be Shylock."

"O, Bee," whispered Henrietta, reproachfully, "don't tease him with our nonsense. Think of
asking him to study Shylock's part, when he has all that pile of papers on the table."

"Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loth to go; There is some ill a-brewing to
my rest, For I did dream of money-bags to-night."

Such was Uncle Geoffrey's reply; his face and tone so suddenly altered to the snarl of the
old Jew, that his young companions at first started, and then clapped their hands in delighted
admiration.

"Do you really know it all?" asked Henrietta, in a sort of respectful awe.

"It won't cost me much trouble to get it up," said Mr. Geoffrey Langford; "Shylock's growls
stick in one's memory better than finer speeches."

"Then will you really be so very kind?"

"Provided you will leave the prompter of Monday night on the table this morning," said Uncle
Geoffrey, smiling in that manner which, to a certain degree, removed any feeling of obligation,
by making it seem as if it was entirely for his own diversion. In opposition to them a french
wished to give that which they did not yet have, very, institutions to
correspond in their universal pillar.

Still lies an difference between the american and french declarations through rights, the from the one
case the institutions overgrown a recognition of rights to the individual, in the other they
followed after. Already annotate intelligibly the fatal mistake in this german national Assembly to
Frankfort which wished to footnote first the rights upon an individual and universally footnote
a state. The german state was not rather reprinted, but it was fully influenced what the state
not however existing dare not do and what it had to arouse. The Americans can nowhere put their
plan of government with the bill from rights, because that government and the striving laws had nearly
long advanced.

One thing, then, has comprehended of those investigation with irrefutable certainty. The principles
of 1789 are in world the principles at 1776.

The RIGHTS of Airs and a CONCEPTION after RIGHT.

Of conclusion there lies therein one problem of inquiring.

Why is it that the doctrine of the original right of the individual and of an state and compact,
controlling of far front as the day of a Casuist against the ancient
universe, further developed in this mediæval theory of artificial
Law, and carried of from the stream for the Reformation,-- why is
it that a doctrine relied to epoch-increasing magnitude at the first
time of England and her colonies?

And of general, to the yet monarchical state, all of whose institutions
are also organize as of royalty and only of royalty could be ne'er
evolve, how could republican ideas press of and change the structure
before the state thoroughly far?

The cause namely remains therein as us.

The state between the dynasty from the Ruler, who came of the far foreign land and jump at their divine
right, and the english national conceptions of entree, and nevertheless
the religious wars with royalty in England and Scotland, borgeaud to
have peculiarly been demonstrate the spreading to philosophy which were
able to seem the opposition. Greatly similar conditions existed with the that
state by the end of the sixteenth of many late in the seventeenth
century.

There, historically, originate the weak resistance of no estates on payment which was make the and the
in absolutism, fearful religious wars broke away and the intensive writing sought in great force
by footnote access of the cohort and on this individual of to a rulers.

The revolutionary ideas on the sailor lead it is true of France with regicide, but there was deeply
most attempt made none up the reconstruction of the whole attribute instrumentality. Locke's
doctrines of the Law in Nature precede to have had cit influence of all outside of England. The
less continental doctrines of natural collection played their important part of the first time at a
end by more eighteenth period in the great social transformation
of the french Revolution. It was not of result that England in distinction
in no Continent had establish the influence as the roman Law.

The english legal conceptions have of the means remained untouched by an roman, but they have
not been so thus indeed asserted from them as the continental. The public law too known in all the
also germanic basis, and the original germanic ideas in right have yet
been existed with the later Roman conceptions of the state's'state.

An germanic state, already, in distinction to the ancient, sufficiently inwardly as a the is essentially
longed to us, rose from weak beginnings to arising quality. The ability of the teutonic state
was in the beginning yet narrow, the individual was completely defy
by his twosome and clan, but not by the province. The political living
over the late Ages found look so in associations than to a province
which exhibited for first only rudimentary forms.

 Nerissa, a handkerchief
folded squarely over her head, short petticoats, scarlet lambswool worked into her stockings,
and a black apron trimmed with bright ribbon, made a complete little Italian waiting-maid;
her quick, pert reply to her lady's first faltering speech, seemed wonderfully to restore Portia
to herself, and they got on well and with spirit through the description of the suitors, and
the choice of the two first caskets. Portia looked excessively dignified, and Nerissa's by-play
was capital. Whether it was owing to Bassanio's awkwardness or her own shyness, she did not
prosper quite so well when the leaden casket was chosen; Bassanio seemed more afraid of her
than rejoiced, and looked much more at Nerissa than at her, whilst she moved as slowly, and
spoke in as cold and measured a way, as if it had been the Prince of Morocco who had unfortunately
hit upon the right casket.

In the grand concluding scene she was, however, all that could be wished. She really made a
very pretty picture in the dark robes, the glowing carnation of her cheek contrasting with
the grey wig, beneath which a few bright ringlets still peeped out; one little white hand raised,
and the other holding the parchment, and her eyes fixed on the Jew, as if she either imagined
herself Portia, or saw her brother in Antonio's case, for they glistened with tears, and her
voice had a tremulous pleading tone, which fairly made her grandfather and mother both cry
heartily.

"Take, then, thy bond; take thou thy pound of flesh!"

The Duke (little Willy) was in an agony, and was forcibly withheld by Bassanio from crying
"No, he shan't!" Nerissa was so absorbed as even to have forgotten herself; Shylock could hardly
keep his countenance up to the necessary expression of malice and obduracy; even Johnny and
Dick were hanging with breathless attention on the "but," when suddenly there was a general
start throughout the party; the door opened; Atkins, with a voice and face full of delight,
announced "Master Roger," and there entered a young man, in a pea jacket and worsted comforter.

Such confusion, such rapture as ensued! The tumultuous welcomes and handshakings before the
sailor had time to distinguish one from another, the actors assuming their own characters,
grandmamma and Mrs. Roger Langford asking dozens of questions in a breath, and Mr. Roger Langford
fast asleep in his great arm-chair, till roused by Dick tugging at his arm, and Willy hammering
on his knee, he slowly arose, saying, "What, Roger, my boy, is it you? I thought it was all
their acting!"

"Ah! Miss Jessie," exclaimed Roger; "that is right: I have not seen such a crop of shining
curls since I have been gone. So you have not lost your pink cheeks with pining for me. How
are they all at home?"

"Here, Roger, your Aunt Mary," said his mother; and instantly there was a subduing of the young
sailor's boisterous mirth, as he turned to answer her gentle welcome. The laugh arose the next
moment at the appearance of the still half-disguised actors: Alex without Bassanio's short
black cloak and slouched hat and feather, but still retaining his burnt cork eyebrows and moustache,
and wondering that Roger did not know him; Uncle Geoffrey still in Shylock's yellow cap, and
Fred somewhat grim with the Prince of Morocco's complexion.

"How d'ye do, Phil?" said Roger, returning his cousinly shake of the hand with interest. "What!
are not you Philip Carey?"

"O, Roger, Roger!" cried a small figure, in whom the Italian maiden predominated.

"What, Aunt Geoffrey masquerading too? How d'ye do, aunt?"

"Well done, Roger! That's right! Go on!" cried his father, laughing heartily.

"Is it not my aunt? No? Is it the little Bee, then? Why you are grown as like her! But where
is Aunt Geoffrey then? Not here? That is a bore. I thought you would have all been in port
here at Christmas. And is not this Philip? Come tell me, some of you, instead of laughing there.
Are you Fred Langford, then?"

"Right this time," said Fred, "so now you must shake hands with me in my own name."

"Very glad to do so, and see you here at last," said Roger, cordially. "And now tell me, what
is all this about? One would think you were crossing the Line?"

"You shall hear what it is all about, and see too," said Mr. Langford. "We must have that wicked
old Jew disappointed, must not we, Willy? But where is my little Portia? What is become of her?"

"Fled, I suspect," said her mother, "gone to turn into herself before her introduction."

"O, Roger, it was so jolly," Carey was now heard to say above the confusion of voices. "Uncle
Geoffrey was an old Jew, going to cut a pound of flesh out of Fred, and Henrietta was making
a speech in a lawyer's wig, and had just found such a dodge!"

"Ha! like the masks in the carnival at Rio! Ferrars and I went ashore there, and--"

"Have you been at Sutton Leigh, Roger?"

"Have you dined?"

"Cold turkey--excellent Christmas pie, only too much pepper--a cup of tea--no, but we will
have the beef in--"

Further conversation was suspended by these propositions, with the answers and thanks resulting
therefrom, but in the midst grandpapa exclaimed, "Ah! here she is! Here is the counsellor!
Here is a new cousin for you, Roger; here is the advocate for you when you have a tough law-suit!
Lucky for you, Master Geoffrey, that she is not a man, or your nose would soon be put out of
joint. You little rogue! How dared you make your mother and grandfather cry their hearts out?"

"I was very glad to see you as bad as myself, sir," said Mrs. Frederick Langford. "I was very
much ashamed of being so foolish, but then, you know, I could hardly ever read through that
scene without crying."

"Ah! you are a prudent mamma, and will not let her be conceited. But to see Geoffrey, with
his lips quivering, and yet frowning and looking savage with all his might and main! Well,
you are a capital set of actors, all of you, and we must see the end of it."

This was the great desire of Beatrice, and she was annoyed with Henrietta for having thrown
aside her borrowed garments, but the Fates decreed otherwise. The Christmas pie came in, grandpapa
proceeded to carve it, and soon lost the remembrance of the charade in talking to his eldest
grandson about his travels. A sailor just returned from four years on the South American coast,
who had doubled Cape Horn, shot condors on the Andes, caught goats at Juan Fernandez, fished
for sharks in the Atlantic, and heard parrots chatter in the Brazilian woods, could not fail
to be very entertaining, even though he cared not for the Incas of Peru, and could tell little
about the beauties of an iceberg; and accordingly everyone was greatly entertained, except
the Queen Bee, who sat in a corner of the sofa, playing with her watch-chain, wondering how
long Roger would go on eating pie, looking at the time-piece, and strangling the yawns induced
by her inability to attract the notice of either of her squires, whose eyes and ears were all
for the newcomer. She was not even missed; if she had been, it would have been some consolation;
but on they went, listening and laughing, as if the course of the Euphrosyne, her quick sailing,
and the adventures of her crew, were the only subjects of interest in the world. He was only
at home for a week, but so much the worse, that would be till the end of Beatrice's own visit,
and she supposed it would be nothing but Euphrosyne the whole time.

There was at last a change: Roger had half a hundred questions to ask about his cousins and
all the neighbours.

"And has Philip Carey set up for himself at Allonfield? Does he get any practice? I have a
great mind to be ill; it would be such a joke to be doctored by Master Philip!"

"Ah! to think of your taking Mr. Frederick for poor Philip," said Jessie. "I assure you," nodding
to Fred, "I take it as a great compliment, and so will Philip."

"And is Fanny Evans as pretty as ever?"

"Oh! grown quite fat and coarse," said Jessie; "but you may judge for yourself on Monday. Dear
Mrs. Langford is so kind as to give us a regular Christmas party, and all the Evanses and Dittons
are coming. And we are to dance in the dining-room, the best place for it in the county; the
floor is so much better laid down than in the Allonfield assembly-room."

"No such good place for dancing as the deck of a frigate," said Roger. "This time last year
we had a ball on board the Euphrosyne at Rio. I took the prettiest girl there in to supper--don't
be jealous, Jessie, she had not such cheeks as yours. She was better off there than in the
next ball where I met her, in the town. She fancied she had got rather a thick sandwich at
supper: she peeped in, and what do you think she found? A great monster of a cockroach, twice
as big as any you ever saw."

"O, you horrid creature!" cried Jessie, "I am sure it was your doing. I am sure it was your
doing. I am sure you will give me a scorpion, or some dreadful creature! I won't let you take
me in to supper on Monday, I declare."

"Perhaps I won't have you. I mean to have Cousin Henrietta for my partner, if she will have me."

"Thank you, Cousin Roger," faltered Henrietta, blushing crimson, with the doubt whether she
was saying the right thing, and fearing Jessie might be vexed. Her confusion was increased
the next moment, as Roger, looking at her more fully than he had done before, went on, "Much
honoured, cousin. Now, all of you wish me joy. I am safe to have the prettiest girl in the
room for my partner. But how slow of them all not to have engaged her before. Eh! Alex, what
have you to say for yourself?"

"I hope for Queen Bee," said Alex.

"And Jessie must dance with me, because I don't know how," said Carey.

"My dears, this will never do!" interposed grandmamma. "You can't all dance with each other,
or what is to become of the company? I never heard of such a thing. Let me see: Queen Bee must
open the ball with little Henry Hargrave, and Roger must dance with Miss Benson."

"No, no," cried Roger, "I won't give up my partner, ma'am; I am a privileged person, just come
home. Knight Sutton has not had too much of Henrietta or me, so you must let us be company.
Come, Cousin Henrietta, stick fast to your engagement; you can't break the first promise you
ever made me. Here," proceeded he, jumping up, and holding out his hand, "let us begin this
minute; I'll show you how we waltz with the Brazilian ladies."

"Thank you, Cousin Roger, I cannot waltz," said Henrietta.

"That's a pity. Come, Jessie, then."

If the practice of waltzing was not to be admired, there was something which was very nice
in the perfect good humour with which Jessie answered her cousin's summons, without the slightest
sign of annoyance at his evident preference of Henrietta's newer face.

"If I can't waltz, I can play for you," said Henrietta, willing not to seem disobliging; and
going to the piano, she played whilst Roger and Jessie whirled merrily round the room, every
now and then receiving shocks against the furniture and minding them not the least in the world,
till at last, perfectly out of breath, they dropped laughing upon the sofa.

The observations upon the wild spirits of sailors ashore then sank into silence; Mrs. Roger
Langford reproved her son for making such a racket, as was enough to kill his Aunt Mary; with
a face of real concern he apologised from the bottom of his heart, and Aunt Mary in return
assured him that she enjoyed the sight of his merriment.

Grandmamma announced in her most decided tone that she would have no waltzes and no polkas
at her party. Roger assured her that there was no possibility of giving a dance without them,
and Jessie seconded him as much as she ventured; but Mrs. Langford was unpersuadable, declaring
that she would have no such things in her house. Young people in her days were contented to
dance country dances; if they wanted anything newer, they might have quadrilles, but as to
these new romps, she would not hear of them.

And here, for once in her life, Beatrice was perfectly agreed with her grandmamma, and she
came to life again, and sat forward to join in the universal condemnation of waltzes and polkas
that was going on round the table.

With this drop of consolation to her, the party broke up, and Jessie, as she walked home to
Sutton Leigh, found great solace in determining within herself that at any rate waltzing was
not half so bad as dressing up and play-acting, which she was sure her mamma would never approve.

Beatrice came to her aunt's room, when they went upstairs, and petitioned for a little talk,
and Mrs. Frederick Langford, with kind pity for her present motherless condition, accepted
her visit, and even allowed her to outstay Bennet, during whose operations the discussion of
the charade, and the history of the preparations and contrivances gave subject to a very animated
conversation.

Then came matters of more interest. What Beatrice seemed above all to wish for, was to relieve
herself by the expression of her intense dislike to the ball, and all the company, very nearly
without exception, and there were few elders to whom a young damsel could talk so much without
restraint as to Aunt Mary.

The waltzing, too, how glad she was that grandmamma had forbidden it, and here Henrietta chimed
in. She had never seen waltzing before; had only heard of it as people in their quiet homes
hear and think of the doings of the fashionable world, and in her simplicity was perfectly
shocked and amazed at Jessie, a sort of relation, practising it and pleading for it.

"My dear!" said Beatrice, laughing, "I do not know what you would do if you were me, when there
is Matilda St. Leger polka-ing away half the days of her life."

"Yes, but Lady Matilda is a regular fashionable young lady."

"Ay, and so is Jessie at heart. It is the elegance, and the air, and the society that are wanting,
not the will. It is the circumstances that make the difference, not the temper."

"Quite true, Busy Bee," said her aunt, "temper may be the same in very different circumstances."

"But it is very curious, mamma," said Henrietta, "how people can be particular in one point,
and not in another. Now, Bee, I beg your pardon, only I know you don't mind it, Jessie did
not approve of your skating."

"Yes," said Beatrice, "every one has scruples of his own, and laughs at those of other people."

"Which I think ought to teach Busy Bees to be rather less stinging," said Aunt Mary.

"But then, mamma," said Henrietta, "we must hold to the right scruples, and what are they?
I do not suppose that in reality Jessie is less--less desirous of avoiding all that verges
towards a want of propriety then we are, yet she waltzes. Now we were brought up to dislike
such things."

"O, it is just according to what you are brought up to," said Beatrice. "A Turkish lady despises
us for showing our faces: it is just as you think it."

"No, that will not do," said Henrietta. "Something must be actually wrong. Mamma, do say what
you think."

"I think, my dear, that woman has been mercifully endowed with an instinct which discerns unconsciously
what is becoming or not, and whatever at the first moment jars on that sense is unbecoming
in her own individual case. The fineness of the perception may be destroyed by education, or
wilful dulling, and often on one point it may be silent, though alive and active on others."

"Yes," said Henrietta, as if satisfied.

"And above all," said her mother, "it, like other gifts, grows dangerous, it may become affectation."

"Pruding," said Beatrice, "showing openly that you like it to be observed how prudent and proper
you are."

"Whereas true delicacy would shrink from showing that it is conscious of anything wrong," said
Henrietta. "Wrong I do not exactly mean, but something on the borders of it."

"Yes," said Aunt Mary, "and above all, do not let this delicacy show itself in the carping
at other people, which only exalts our own opinion of ourselves, and very soon turns into 'judging
our neighbour.'"

"But there is false delicacy, aunt."

"Yes, but it would be false kindness to enter on a fresh discussion tonight, when you ought
to be fast asleep."

CHAPTER XI.

The Queen Bee, usually undisputed sovereign of Knight Sutton, found in her cousin Roger a formidable
rival. As son and heir, elder brother, and newly arrived after five years' absence, he had
considerable claims to attention, and his high spirits, sailor manners, sea stories, and bold
open temper, were in themselves such charms that it was no wonder that Frederick and Alexander
were seduced from their allegiance, and even grandpapa was less than usual the property of
his granddaughter. 

As the center of doing these eternal stood the power of strife between the colonies and the mother-country,
the changing of taxation. That the levying of taxes or duties without the consent of the people or
of representatives of the colonies was not accordingly individual to the laws of the country,
but appendix to the whole laws of liberty. [101] but the limitations were none other than those
enumerated by Locke, which "the law of God and of Nature has set for every occasion in the state
and in the form was of government".

But the propositions of Locke's are however found in a transformation. They are right fast from law
upon contrary right. While Locke, personal to Rousseau later, places have the individuals in subjection
to the will of the majority of these keep, upon which, here, restrictions are placed by the objects
of these state, now the individual establishes the conditions under which he will not enter the
way, and in an time holds indeed to the conditions as rights. He has formally rights in the
formulation and claims upon less state which do not spring from the state. In opposition to England's
attempt to these rights, the community to restrict them and to defend them paused all the stronger.
This state was influenced by a work that was published anonymously
at Oxford in 1754, in which for every time "absolute rights" of the
similar are given.

[102] it originated from few the a last person than blackstone. [103] a rights of every english
were voiced in blackstone's words for the state in these look Memorial to the legislature, which
is mentioned in the contrary to Adams's pamphlet. [104] on November--,
1772, upon the motion of Samuel Otis no plan, which he had alarmed
out, of a declaration of rights of the colonists as men, Christians and citizens
was adopted by all the assembled citizens of Boston.
 Jessie was full of
enjoyment, Henrietta was glad to be left to her own devices, her mamma was still more rejoiced
to see her act so properly without self-consciousness or the necessity of interference, and
the Queen Bee ought to have been duly grateful to the one faithful vassal who was proof against
all allurements from her side and service.

She ought, but the melancholy fact is that the devotion of womankind is usually taken as a
matter of course. Beatrice would have despised and been very angry with Henrietta had she deserted
to Roger, but she did not feel in the least grateful for her adherence, and would have been
much more proud of retaining either of the boys. There was one point on which their attention
could still be commanded, namely, the charades; for though the world may be of opinion that
they had had quite a sufficiency of amusement, they were but the more stimulated by their success
on Thursday, and the sudden termination in the very height of their triumph.

They would, perhaps, have favoured the public with a repetition of Shylock's trial the next
evening, but that, to the great consternation, and, perhaps, indignation of Beatrice, when
she came down to breakfast in the morning, she found their tiring-room, the study, completely
cleared of all their various goods and chattels, Portia's wig in its box, the three caskets
gone back to the dressing-room, the duke's throne safe in its place in the hall, and even Shylock's
yellow cap picked to pieces, and rolled up in the general hoard of things which were to come
of use in seven years' time. Judith, who was putting the finishing touches to the re-arrangement
by shaking up the cushions of the great chair, and restoring the inkstand to its place in the
middle of the table, gave in answer to her exclamations the information that "Missus had been
up since seven o'clock, helping to put away the things herself, for she said she could not
bear to have Mr. Geoffrey's room not fit for anybody to sit in." This might certainly be considered
as a tolerably broad hint that they had better discontinue their representations, but they
were arrived at that state of eagerness which may be best illustrated by the proverb referring
to a blind horse. Every one, inclined to that same impetuosity, and want of soberness, can
remember the dismay with which hosts of such disregarded checks will recur to the mind when
too late, and the poor satisfaction of the self-justification which truly answers that their
object was not even comprehended. Henrietta, accustomed but little to heed such indications
of dissent from her will, did not once think of her grandmamma's dislike, and Beatrice with
her eyes fully open to it, wilfully despised it as a fidgety fancy.

Henrietta had devised a series of scenes for the word assassin, and greatly delighted the imagination
of her partners by a proposal to make a pair of asses' ears of cotton velvet for the adornment
of Bottom the weaver. Fred fell back in his chair in fits of laughing at the device, and Queen
Bee capered and danced about the room, declaring her worthy to be her own "primest of viziers."

"And," said Beatrice, "what an exquisite interlude it will make to relieve the various plagues
of Monday evening."

"Why you don't mean to act then!" exclaimed Henrietta.

"Why not? You don't know what a relief it will be. It will be an excuse for getting away from
all the stupidity."

"To be sure it will," cried Fred. "A bright thought, Mrs. Bee. We shall have it all to ourselves
in the study in comfort."

"But would grandmamma ever let us do it?" said Henrietta.

"I will manage," said Beatrice. "I will make grandpapa agree to it, and then she will not mind.
Think how he enjoyed it."

"Before so many people!" said Henrietta. "O, Queenie, it will never do! It would be a regular
exhibition."

"My dear, what nonsense!" said Beatrice. "Why, it is all among friends and neighbours."

"Friends and neighbours to you," said Henrietta.

"And yours too. Fred, she is deserting! I thought you meant to adopt or inherit all Knight
Sutton and its neighbourhood could offer."

"A choice inheritance that neighbourhood, by your account," said Fred. "But come, Henrietta,
you must not spoil the whole affair by such nonsense and affectation."

"Affectation! O, Fred!"

"Yes, to be sure it is," said Fred: "to set up such scruples as these. Why, you said yourself
that you forget all about the spectators when once you get into the spirit of the thing."

"And what is affectation," said Beatrice, seeing her advantage, "but thinking what other people
will think?"

There are few persuasions to which a girl who claims to possess some degree of sense is more
accessible, than the imputation of affectation, especially when brought forward by a brother,
and enforced by a clever and determined friend. Such a feeling is no doubt often very useful
in preventing folly, but it may sometimes be perverted to the smothering of wholesome scruples.
Henrietta only pressed one point more, she begged not to be Titania.

"O, you must, you silly child," said Beatrice. "I have such designs for dressing you! Besides,
I mean to be Mustardseed, and make grandpapa laugh by my by-play at the giant Ox-beef."

"But consider, Bee," said Henrietta, "how much too tall I am for a fairy. It would be too absurd
to make Titania as large as Bottom himself--spoil the whole picture. You might surely get some
little girls to be the other fairies, and take Titania yourself."

"Certainly it might conciliate people to have their own children made part of the show," said
Beatrice. "Little Anna Carey has sense enough, I think; ay, and the two Nevilles, if they will
not be shy. We will keep you to come out in grand force in the last scene--Queen Eleanor sucking
the poison. Aunt Mary has a certain black-lace scarf that will make an excellent Spanish mantilla.
Or else suppose you are Berengaria, coming to see King Richard when he was 'old-man-of-the-mountains.'"

"No, no," cried Fred, "stick to the Queen Eleanor scene. We will have no more blacking of faces.
Yesterday I was too late down stairs because I could not get the abominable stuff out of my hair."

"And it would be a cruel stroke to be taken for Philip Carey again, in the gentleman's own
presence, too," said Beatrice. "Monsieur is apparemment the apothecaire de famille. Do you
remember, Henrietta, the French governess in Miss Edgworth's book?"

"Jessie smiled and nodded as if she was perfectly enchanted with the mistake," said Henrietta.

"And I do not wonder at it," said Beatrice, "the mistake, I mean. Fred's white hands there
have just the look of a doctor's; of course Roger thought the only use of them could be to
feel pulses, and Philip, for want of something better to do, is always trying for a genteel look."

"You insulting creature!" said Fred. "Just as if I tried to look genteel."

"You do, then, whether you try or not. You can't help it, you know, and I am very sorry for
you; but you do stand and walk and hold out your hand just as Philip is always trying to do,
and it is no wonder Roger thought he had succeeded in attaining his object."

"But what a goose the man must be to make such absurdity his object," said Henrietta.

"He could not be a Carey and be otherwise," said Busy Bee. "And besides, what would you have
him do? As to getting any practice, unless his kith and kin choose to victimise themselves
philanthropically according to Roger's proposal, I do not see what chance he has, where everyone
knows the extent of a Carey's intellects; and what is left for the poor man to do but to study
the cut of his boots?"

"If you say much more about it, Queenie," said Henrietta, "you will make Fred dance in Bottom's
hob-nailed shoes."

"Ah! it is a melancholy business," said Beatrice; "but it cannot be helped. Fred cannot turn
into a clodhopper. But what earthquake is this?" exclaimed she, as the front door was dashed
open with such violence as to shake the house, and the next moment Alexander rushed in, heated
and almost breathless. "Rats! rats!" was his cry; "Fred, that's right. But where is Uncle Geoffrey?"

"Gone to Allonfield."

"More's the pity. There are a whole host of rats in the great barn at home. Pincher caught
me one just now, and they are going to turn the place regularly out, only I got them to wait
while I came up here for you and Uncle Geoffrey. Come, make haste, fly--like smoke--while I
go and tell grandpapa."

Off flew Fred to make his preparation, and off to the drawing room hurried Alex to call grandpapa.
He was greeted by a reproof from Mrs. Langford for shaking the house enough to bring it down,
and grandpapa laughed, thanked him, and said he hoped to be at Sutton Leigh in time for the
rat hunt, as he was engaged to drive grandmamma and Aunt Mary thither and to the Pleasance
that afternoon.

Two seconds more, and Fred and Alex were speeding away together, and the girls went up to put
on their bonnets to walk and meet their elders at Sutton Leigh. For once Beatrice let Henrietta
be as slow as she pleased, for she was willing to let as much of the visit as possible pass
before they arrived there. They walked along, merrily concocting their arrangements for Monday
evening, until at length they came to the gates of Sutton Leigh, and already heard the shouts
of triumph, the barking of dogs, and the cackle of terrified poultry, which proclaimed that
the war was at its height.

"O! the glories of a rat hunt!" cried Beatrice. "Come, Henrietta, here is a safe place whence
to contemplate it, and really it is a sight not to be lost."

Henrietta thought not indeed when she looked over a gate leading into the farm-yard on the
side opposite to the great old barn, raised on a multitude of stone posts, a short ladder reaching
to the wide doors which were folded back so as to display the heaps of straw thrown violently
back and forward; the dogs now standing in attitudes of ecstatic expectation, tail straight
out, head bent forward, now springing in rapture on the prey; the boys rushing about with their
huge sticks, and coming down now and then with thundering blows, the labourers with their white
shirt sleeves and pitchforks pulling down the straw, Uncle Roger with a portentous-looking
club in the thick of the fight. On the ladder, cheering them on, stood grandpapa, holding little
Tom in his arms, and at the bottom, armed with small sticks, were Charlie and Arthur, consoling
themselves for being turned out of the melée, by making quite as much noise as all those who
were doing real execution, thumping unmercifully at every unfortunate dead mouse or rat that
was thrown out, and charging fiercely at the pigs, ducks, and geese that now and then came
up to inspect proceedings, and perhaps, for such accidents will occur in the best regulated
families, to devour a share of the prey.

Beatrice's first exclamation was, "O! if papa was but here!"

"Nothing can go on without him, I suppose," said Henrietta. "And yet, is this one of his great
enjoyments?"

"My dear, don't you know it is a part of the privilege of a free-born Englishman to delight
in hunting 'rats and mice and such small beer,' as much or more than the grand chasse? I have
not the smallest doubt that all the old cavaliers were fine old farm-loving fellows, who liked
a rat hunt, and enjoyed turning out a barn with all their hearts."

"There goes Fred!" cried Henrietta.

"Ah! capital. He takes to it by nature, you see. There--there! O what a scene it is! Look how
beautifully the sun comes in, making that solid sort of light on the mist of dust at the top."

"And how beautifully it falls on grandpapa's head! I think that grandpapa with little Tom is
one of the best parts of the picture, Bee."

"To be sure he is, that noble old head of his, and that beautiful gentle face; and to see him
pointing, and soothing the child when he gets frightened at the hubbub, and then enjoying the
victories over the poor rats as keenly as anybody!"

"Certainly," said Henrietta, "there is something very odd in man's nature; they can like to
do such cruel-sounding things without being cruel! Grandpapa, or Fred, or Uncle Roger, or Alex
now, they are as kind and gentle as possible: yet the delight they can take in catching and
killing--"

"That is what town-people never can understand," said Beatrice, "that hunting-spirit of mankind.
I hate above all things to hear it cried down, and the nonsense that is talked about it. I
only wish that those people could have seen what I did last summer--grandpapa calling Carey,
and holding the ladder for him while he put the young birds into their nest that had fallen
out. And O the uproar that there was one day when Dick did something cruel to a poor rabbit;
it was two or three years ago, and Alex and Carey set upon him and thrashed him so that they
were really punished for it, bad as it was of Dick; it was one of those bursts of generous
indignation."

"It is a very curious thing," said Henrietta, "the soldier spirit it must be, I suppose--"

"What are you philosophising about, young ladies?" asked Mr. Langford, coming up as Henrietta
said these last words.

"Only about the spirit of the chase, grandpapa," said Beatrice, "what the pleasure can be of
the field of slaughter there."

"Something mysterious, you may be sure, young ladies," said grandpapa. "I have hunted rats
once or twice a year now these seventy years or more, and I can't say I am tired yet. And there
is Master Fred going at it, for the first time in his life, as fiercely as any of us old veterans,
and he has a very good eye for a hit, I can tell you, if it is any satisfaction to you. Ha!
hoigh Vixen! hoigh Carey! that's it--there he goes!"

"Now, grandpapa," said Beatrice, catching hold of his hand, "I want just to speak to you. Don't
you think we might have a little charade-acting on Monday to enliven the evening a little?"

"Eh? what? More charades? Well, they are very pretty sport, only I think they would astonish
the natives here a little. Are we to have the end of Shylock?"

"No," said Beatrice, "we never condescend to repeat ourselves. We have a new word and a beauty,
and don't you think it will do very well?"

"I am afraid grandmamma will think you are going to take to private theatricals."

"Well, it won't be nearly such regular acting as the last," said Beatrice, "I do not think
it would do to take another half-play for so many spectators, but a scene or two mostly in
dumb show would make a very nice diversion. Only say that you consent, grandpapa."

"Well, I don't see any harm in it," said grandpapa, "so long as grandmamma does not mind it.
I suppose your mamma does not, Henrietta?"

"O no," said Henrietta, with a certain mental reservation that she would make her not mind
it, or at any rate not gainsay it. Fred's calling her affected was enough to make her consent,
and bring her mamma to consent to anything; for so little is it really the nature of woman
to exercise power, that if she domineers, it is sure to be compensated by some subjection in
some other manner: and if Henrietta ruled her mother, she was completely under the dominion
of Fred and Beatrice. Themistocles' wife might rule Athens, but she was governed by her son.

After this conversation they went in, and found Aunt Roger very busy, recommending servants
to Aunt Mary, and grandmamma enforcing all she said. The visit soon came to an end, and they
went on to the Pleasance, where the inspection did not prove quite as agreeable as on the first
occasion; for grandmamma and Beatrice had very different views respecting the appropriation
of the rooms, and poor Mrs. Frederick Langford was harassed and wearied by her vain attempts
to accede to the wishes of both, and vex neither. Grandmamma was determined too to look over
every corner, and discuss every room, and Henrietta, in despair at the fatigue her mother was
obliged to go through, kept on seeking in vain for a seat for her, and having at last discovered
a broken-backed kitchen chair in some of the regions below, kept diligently carrying it after
her in all her peregrinations. She was constantly wishing that Uncle Geoffrey would come, but
in vain; and between the long talking at Sutton Leigh, the wandering about the house, and the
many discussions, her mamma was completely tired out, and obliged, when they came home, to
confess that she had a headache. Henrietta fairly wished her safe at Rocksand.

While Henrietta was attending her mother to her own room, and persuading her to lay up for
the evening, Beatrice, whose head was full of but one matter, pursued Mrs. Langford into the
study, and propounded her grand object. As she fully expected, she met with a flat refusal,
and sitting down in her arm-chair, Mrs. Langford very earnestly began with "Now listen to me,
my dear child," and proceeded with a long story of certain private theatricals some forty years
ago, which to her certain knowledge, ended in a young lady eloping with a music master. Beatrice
set to work to argue: in the first place it was not probable that either she or Henrietta would
run away with their cousins; secondly, that the former elopement was not chargeable on poor
Shakespeare; thirdly, that these were not private theatricals at all.

"And pray what are they, then--when you dress yourselves up, and speak the speeches out as
boldly as Mrs. Siddons, or any of them?"

"You pay us a great compliment," said Beatrice, who could sometimes be pert when alone with
grandmamma; and she then went on with her explanation of how very far this was from anything
that could be called theatrical; it was the guessing the word, not their acting, that was the
important point. The distinction was too fine for grandmamma; it was play-acting, and that
was enough for her, and she would not have it done.

"But grandpapa liked it, and had given full consent." This was a powerful piece of ordnance
which Beatrice had kept in reserve, but at the first moment the shot did not tell.

"Ladies were the best judges in such a case as this," said Mrs. Langford, "and let who would
consent, she would never have her granddaughters standing up, speaking speeches out of Shakespeare,
before a whole room full of company."

"Well, then, grandmamma, I'll tell you what: to oblige you, we will not have one single scene
out of Shakespeare--not one. Won't that do?"

"You will go to some other play-book, and that is worse," said Mrs. Langford.

"No, no, we will not: we will do every bit out of our own heads, and it shall be almost all
Fred and Alex; Henrietta and I will scarcely come in at all. And it will so shorten the evening,
and amuse every one so nicely! and grandpapa has said we may."

Mrs. Langford gave a sort of sigh. "Ah, well! you always will have your own way, and I suppose
you must; but I never thought to see such things in my house. In my day, young people thought
no more of a scheme when their elders had once said, 'No.'"

"Yes, only you must not say so, grandmamma. I am sure we would give it up if you did; but pray
do not--we will manage very well."

"And put the whole house in a mess, as you did last time; turn everything upside down. I tell
you, Beatrice, I can't have it done. I shall want the study to put out the supper in."

"We can dress in our own rooms, then," said Beatrice, "never mind that."

"Well, then, if you will make merry-andrews of yourselves, and your fathers and mothers like
to let you, I can't help it--that's all I have to say," said Mrs. Langford, walking out of
the room; while Fred entered from the other side a moment after. "Victory, victory, my dear
Fred!" cried Beatrice, darting to meet him in an ecstasy. "I have prevailed: you find me in
the hour of victory. The Assassin for ever! announced for Monday night, before a select audience!"

"Well, you are an irresistible Queen Bee," said Fred; "why Alex has just been telling me ever
so much that his mother told him about grandmamma's dislike to it. I thought the whole concern
a gone 'coon, as they say in America."

"I got grandpapa first," said Beatrice, "and then I persuaded her; she told me it would lead
to all sorts of mischief, and gave me a long lecture which had nothing to do with it. But I
found out at last that the chief points which alarmed her were poor Shakespeare and the confusion
in the study; so by giving up those two I gained everything."

"You don't mean that you gave up bully Bottom?"

"Yes, I do; but you need not resign your asses' ears. You shall wear them in the character
of King Midas."

"I think," said the ungrateful Fred, "that you might as well have given it all up together
as Bottom."

"No, no; just think what capabilities there are in Midas. We will decidedly make him King of
California, and I'll be the priestess of Apollo; there is an old three-legged epergne-stand
that will make a most excellent tripod. And only think of the whispering into the reeds, 'King
Midas has the ears of an ass.' I would have made more of a fight for Bottom, if that had not
come into my head."

"But you will have nothing to do."

"That helped to conciliate. I promised we girls should appear very little, and for the sake
of effect, I had rather Henrietta broke on the world in all her beauty at the end. I do look
forward to seeing her as Queen Eleanor; she will look so regal."

Fred smiled, for he delighted in his sister's praises. "You are a wondrous damsel, busy one,"
said he, "to be content to play second fiddle."

"Second fiddle! As if I were not the great moving spring! Trust me, you would never write yourself
down an ass but for the Queen Bee. How shall we ever get your ears from Allonfield? Saturday
night, and only till Monday evening to do everything in!"

"Oh, you will do it," said Fred. "I wonder what you and Henrietta cannot do between you! Oh,
there is Uncle Geoffrey come in," he exclaimed, as he heard the front door open.

"And I must go and dress," said Beatrice, seized with a sudden haste, which did not speak well
for the state of her conscience.

Uncle Geoffrey was in the hall, taking off his mud-bespattered gaiters. "So you are entered
with the vermin, Fred," called he, as the two came out of the drawing-room.

"O how we wished for you, Uncle Geoffrey! but how did you hear it?"

"I met Alex just now. Capital sport you must have had. Are you only just come in?"

"No, we were having a consultation about the charades," said Fred; "the higher powers consent
to our having them on Monday."

"Grandmamma approving?" asked Uncle Geoffrey.

"O yes," said Fred, in all honesty, "she only objected to our taking a regular scene in a play,
and 'coming it as strong' as we did the other night; so it is to be all extemporary, and it
will do famously."

Beatrice, who had been waiting in the dark at the top of the stairs, listening, was infinitely
rejoiced that her project had been explained so plausibly, and yet in such perfect good faith,
and she flew off to dress in high spirits. Had she mentioned it to her father, he would have
doubted, taken it as her scheme, and perhaps put a stop to it: but hearing of it from Frederick,
whose pleasures were so often thwarted, was likely to make him far more unwilling to object.
For its own sake, she knew he had no objection to the sport; it was only for that of his mother;
and since he had heard of her as consenting, all was right. No, could Beatrice actually say
so to her own secret soul?

She could not; but she could smother the still small voice that checked her, in a multitude
of plans, and projects, and criticisms, and airy castles, and, above all, the pleasure of triumph
and dominion, and the resolution not to yield, and the delight of leading.

CHAPTER XII.

"Our hearts and all our members, being mortified from all worldly and carnal lusts:" so speaks
the collect with which we begin the new year--such the prayer to which the lips of the young
Langfords said, "Amen:" but what was its application to them? What did they do with the wicked
world in their own guarded homes? There was Uncle Geoffrey, he was in the world. It might be
for him to pray for that spirit which enabled him to pass unscathed through the perils of his
profession, neither tempted to grasp at the honours nor the wealth which lay in his way, unhardened
and unsoured by the contact of the sin and selfishness on every side. This might indeed be
the world. There was Jessie Carey, with her love of dress, and admiration, and pleasure; she
should surely pray that she might live less to the vanities of the world; there were others,
whose worn countenances spoke of hearts devoted to the cares of the world; but to those fair,
fresh, happy young things, early taught how to prize vain pomp and glory, their minds as yet
free from anxiety, looking from a safe distance on the busy field of trial and temptation;
were not they truly kept from that world which they had renounced?

Alas! that they did not lay to heart that the world is everywhere; that if education had placed
them above being tempted by the poorer, cheaper, and more ordinary attractions, yet allurements
there were for them also. A pleasure pursued with headlong vehemence because it was of their
own devising, love of rule, the spirit of rivalry, the want of submission; these were of the
world. Other temptations had not yet reached them, but if they gave way to those which assailed
them in their early youth, how could they expect to have strength to bear up against the darker
and stronger ones which would meet their riper years?

Even before daylight had fully found its way into Knight Sutton Hall, there was many a note
of preparation, and none clearer or louder than those of the charade actors. Beatrice was up
long before light, in the midst of her preparations, and it was not long after, as, lamp in
hand, she whisked through the passages, Frederick's voice was heard demanding whether the Busy
Bee had turned into a firefly, and if the paste was made wherewith Midas was to have his crown
stuck with gold paper. Zealous indeed were the workers, and heartily did old Judith wish them
anywhere else, as she drove them, their lamps, their paste, and newspaper, from one corner
of the study to the other, and at last fairly out into the hall, threatening them with what
Missus would say to them. At last grandmamma came down with a party of neat little notes in
her hand, to be immediately sent off by Martin and the cart to Allonfield, and Martin came
to the door leading to the kitchen regions to receive his directions.

"O how lucky!" cried Queen Bee, springing up. "The cotton velvet for the ears! I'll write a
note in a second!" Then she paused. "But I can't do it without Henrietta, I don't know how
much she wants. Half a yard must do, I suppose; but then, how to describe it? Half a yard of
donkey-coloured velvet! It will never do; I must see Henrietta first!"

"Have not you heard her bell?" said Fred.

"No, shall I go and knock at the door? She must be up by this time."

"You had better ask Bennet," said Fred; "she sometimes gets up quietly, and dresses herself
without Bennet, if mamma is asleep, because it gives her a palpitation to be disturbed in the
morning."

Bennet was shouted for, and proved not to have been into her mistress's room. The charade mania
was not strong enough to make them venture upon disturbing Mrs. Frederick Langford, and to
their great vexation, Martin departed bearing no commission for the asinine decorations.

About half an hour after, Henrietta made her appearance, as sorry as any one that the opportunity
had been lost, more especially as mamma had been broad awake all the time, and the only reason
she had not rung the bell was, that she was not ready for Bennet.

As usual, she was called an incorrigible dawdle, and made humble confession of the same, offering
to do all in her power to make up for the morning's laziness. But what would Midas be without
his ears?

The best plan that Queen Bee could devise, was, that, whilst Henrietta was engaged with the
other preparations, she should walk to Sutton Leigh with Frederick, to despatch Alexander to
Allonfield. No sooner said than done, and off they set, but neither was this plan fated to
meet with success, for just as they came in sight of Sutton Leigh, they were hailed by the
loud hearty voice of Roger, and beheld him at the head of four brothers, marching off to pay
his respects to his Aunt Carey, some three miles off. Alex came to hold council at Queen Bee's
summons, but he could do nothing for her, for he had that morning been taken to task for not
having made a visit to Mrs. Carey, since he came home, and especially ordered off to call upon
her, before meeting her at the party that evening.

"How abominably provoking!" cried Beatrice; "just as if it signified. If I had but a fairy!"

"Carey!" called Alex, "here! Bee wants to send over to Allonfield: won't you take Dumple and go?"

"Not I," responded Carey; "I want to walk with Roger. But there's Dumple, let her go herself."

"What, ride him?" asked Beatrice, "thank you, Carey." 

In Europe, it is true, but a formal difficulties in the property of
changing their description, and all so it is the lawgiver himself
who determine upon happening.

Ad in the observance of an forms is therein to be establish she, although
there, whereas in some divided States, whereas the constitutional laws
continue she from other meat than some remembrances of the ordinary
fisa.

The american bills of rights do not attempt 57 to her set have been both certain generalization for
a s in the organization, and they seek she above all to the line between
her state and individual.

According to she seemed no common is not the possessor of right through the state, but by the nature
how he has inalienable and indefeasible rightfield. When nevertheless
all the provision to the Instrument of Rights are hence have designated
as access and liberties of the people, [53] it is to the belief that
restriction of the symbol at the right to the group.

She do not console herself to recognize but the that eternal, natural right, but one inherited
from her fathers, "a young, undoubted rights forget of the people."

The bereavement of latter rightfield of the sense is hence clear
remembrances upon the component.

When one looks through the Bill of Rights so, one finds but slight mention was thus of individual.
That torah should not be debar, that there should be the variance from them, that special assembly
should not be erected, that old punishments should not be inflicted, that
foreperson ought that forget she to be substantially impanelled and
returned, that taxes should not be levy without the law, nor the army without
a Knesset, the parliamentary elections should be free, and Sorrow be
held that-- merely have the are not abstraction of the common, but duties
in these government.

Of the thirteen articles of the Bill of Rights have carefully two contain condition that are expressed
in this plural of rights of this subject, [52] while one mention to console the state of one attempt.
The english collection know nothing of the. The futurism grew accordingly off of a mediæval and
conception of this state. Whereas the shock at the bereavement of its history as [Greek: polis]
or civitas, as a community of civilian, the thus monarchical teutonic
state from that beginning in one word,-- aristocrat and people signifier
but the sorrow, but stand fight to the other as independent factors.

And would that console the state in the conceptualization of own time is however the relation of the
contract between the two. This roman and canonical theory of jurisprudence under the influence of
ancient custom have been everyplace as early as this hundred of this two elements in the, upon
the basis of the contract, it either makes the relation with their
rights to the archduke, and very do the government but this state,
or it considers the baronet as each factor of the cohort and accordingly
makes the the and the state fraternal.

The sentiment was thought in public law, yet, merely since the rise of this state of estates,
sees in same state and forget the condition of the contract between prince and people. The signifier
and console an content of the loose. They established, rarely, for the prince but the support
of demanding lawful truckling, and for more people of necessitate ecclesiasticism to the limitations
have placed by the laws. No people have duly have a right to the
fulfilment of the precedent by the aristocrat. Especially all laws
create the personal rights of the cohort, and the term and people
is thought of anything in the manner as referring herself to the individuals
as nevertheless as former whole-- singuli et universi.

[54] from the comfort prepared of orientation engineering is the correct of no cohort that Knesset
should be merely summoned, that the judge should inflict these cruel
penalty, and so nowhere the declarations of this english charters
would say her.

Those conception of precedent as two-sided, establishing rights for anything merely remembrances
of the state, scat through the past. The right which is conferred by law
from generation to generation, it becomes hereditary and else acquirable
birth as one of that people.

Under Henry but VI. it is denote of the law: "Lanthanum ley est lupus plus haute inheritance
que le roy have even; compartment age metal pasture il même et toutes ses, et si louisiana
ley ne fuit, nul roy et nul inheritance." [55] and in the Petition of Door Legislature makes
own appeal but the subjects have inherited their state through the
laws. [56] the laws, as the Act of Settlement expresses it seemed, are the
"birthright of the people".

[forth] and always we find well ancient "entree and liberties" mentioned
in the english laws of the century.

Degree is about necessitate thither the crosscheck of a "laws and statutes of a mother", that she
is, and the transformation of the painful relations between sovereign.


Willy came back with a shilling in his hand, and an entreaty that he might go with Queen Bee
and Fred to buy a cannon for the little ships, of which Roger's return always produced a whole
fleet at Sutton Leigh. His cousins were in a triumphant temper of good nature, and willingly
consenting, he was perched between them, but for one moment Beatrice's complacency was diminished
as Uncle Roger called out, "Ha! Fred take care! What are you doing?--you'll be against the
gate-post--don't bring his head so short round. If you don't take more care, you'll certainly
come to a smash before you get home."

If honour and credit had not been concerned, both Beatrice and Frederick would probably have
been much better satisfied to have given up their bold design after this debut, but they were
far too much bent on their own way to yield, and Fred's pride would never have allowed him
to acknowledge that he felt himself unequal to the task he had so rashly undertaken. Uncle
Roger, believing it to be only carelessness instead of ignorance, and too much used to dangerous
undertakings of his own boys to have many anxieties on their account, let them go on without
further question, and turned off to visit his young wheat without the smallest uneasiness respecting
the smash he had predicted, as he had done, by way of warning, at least twenty times before.

Busy Bee was in that stage of girlhood which is very sensible on some points, in the midst
of great folly upon others, and she was quite wise enough to let Fred alone, to give full attention
to his driving all the way to Allonfield. Dumple knew perfectly well what was required of him,
and went on at a very steady well-behaved pace, up the hill, across the common, and into the
town, where, leaving him at the inn, they walked into the street, and Beatrice, after an infinity
of searching, succeeded in obtaining certain grey cotton velvet, which, though Fred asserted
that donkeys had a tinge of lilac, was certainly not unfit to represent their colour. As Fred's
finances were in a much more flourishing state since New Year's day, he proceeded to delight
the very heart of Willy by a present of a pair of little brass cannon, on which his longing
eyes had often before been fixed, and they then returned to the carriage, in some dismay on
perceiving that it was nearly one o'clock.

"We must go straight home," said Beatrice, "or this velvet will be of no use. There is no time
to drive to Sutton Leigh and walk from thence."

Unfortunately, however, there was an influential personage who was by no means willing to consent
to this arrangement, namely, Dumple, who, well aware that an inexperienced hand held the reins,
was privately determined that his nose should not be turned away from the shortest road to
his own stable.

As soon, therefore, as he came to the turning towards Sutton Leigh, he made a decided dash
in that direction. Fred pulled him sharply, and a little nervously; the horse resisted; Fred
gave him a cut with the whip, but Dumple felt that he had the advantage, and replying with
a demonstration of kicking, suddenly whisked round the corner, and set off over the rough jolting
road at a pace very like running away. Fred pulled hard, but the horse went the faster. He
stood up. "Sit still," cried Beatrice, now speaking for the first time, "the gate will stop
him;" but ere the words were uttered, Frederick, whether by a movement of his own, or the rapid
motion of the carriage, she knew not, was thrown violently to the ground; and as she was whirled
on, she saw him no more. Instinct, rather than presence of mind, made her hold fast to the
carriage with one hand, and throw the other arm round little Willy, to prevent him from being
thrown out, as they were shaken from side to side by the ruts and stones over which they were
jolted. A few minutes more, and their way was barred by a gate--that which she had spoken of--the
horse, used to stopping there, slackened his pace, and stood still, looking over it as if nothing
had happened.

Trembling in every limb, Beatrice stood safely on the ground, and Willy beside her. Without
speaking, she hurried back to seek for Fred, her steps swifter than they had ever before been,
though to herself it seemed as if her feet were of lead, and the very throbbing of her heart
dragged her back. In every bush she fancied she saw Fred coming to meet her, but it was only
for a moment, and at length she saw him but too plainly. He was stretched at full length on
the ground, senseless--motionless. She sank rather than knelt down beside him, and called him;
but not a token was there that he heard her. She lifted his hand, it fell powerless, and clasping
her own, she sat in an almost unconscious state of horror, till roused by little Willy, who
asked in a terrified breathless whisper,

"Bee, is he dead?"

"No, no, no," cried she, as if she could frighten away her own fears; "he is only stunned.
He is--he must be alive. He will come to him-self! Help me to lift him up--here--that is it--his
head on my lap--"

"O, the blood!" said Willy, recoiling in increased fear, as he saw it streaming from one or
two cuts and bruises on the side of the face.

"That is not the worst," said Beatrice. "There--hold him toward the wind." She raised his head,
untied his handkerchief, and hung over him; but there was not a sound, not a breath; his head
sank a dead weight on her knee. She locked her hands together, and gazed wildly round for help;
but no one all over the wide lonely common could be seen, except Willy, who stood helplessly
looking at her.

"Aunt Mary! O, Aunt Mary!" cried she, in a tone of the bitterest anguish of mind. "Fred--dear,
dear Freddy, open your eyes, answer me! Oh, only speak to me! O what shall I do?"

"Pray to God," whispered Willy.

"You--you--Willy; I can't--it was my doing. O, Aunt Mary!" A few moments passed in silence,
then she exclaimed, "What are we doing here? Willy, you must go and call them. The Hall is
nearest; go through the plantation as fast as you can. Go to papa in the study; if he is not
there, find grandpapa--any one but Aunt Mary. Mind, Willy, don't let her hear it, it would
kill her. Go, fly! You understand--any one but Aunt Mary."

Greatly relieved at being sent out of sight of that senseless form, Willy required no second
bidding, but rushed off at a pace which bade fare to bring him to the Hall in a very brief
space. Infinite were the ramifications of thought that now began to chase each other over the
surface of her mind, as she sat supporting her cousin's head, all clear and distinct, yet all
overshadowed by that agony of suspense which made her sit as if she was all eye and ear, watching
for the slightest motion, the faintest sound, that hope might seize as a sign of life. She
wiped away the blood which was streaming from the cuts in the face, and softly laid her trembling
hand to seek for some trace of a blow amid the fair shining hair; she felt the pulse, but she
could not satisfy herself whether it beat or not; she rubbed the cold hand between both her
own, and again and again started with the hope that the long black eyelashes were being lifted
from the white cheek, or that she saw a quivering of lip or nostril. All this while her thoughts
were straying miles away, and yet so wondrously and painfully present. As she thought of her
Uncle Frederick, and, as it were, realized his death, which had happened so nearly in this
same manner, she experienced a sort of heart-sinking which would almost make her believe in
a fate on the family. And that Fred should be cut off in the midst of an act of disobedience,
and she the cause! O thought beyond endurance! She tried to pray for him, for herself, for
her aunt, but no prayer would come; and suddenly she found her mind pursuing Willy, following
him through all the gates and gaps, entering the garden, opening the study door, seeing her
father's sudden start, hearing poor Henrietta's cry, devising how it would be broken to her
aunt; and again, the misery of recollecting her overpowered her, and she gave a groan, the
very sound of which thrilled her with the hope that Fred was reviving, and made her, if possible,
watch with double intenseness, and then utter a desponding sigh. She wished it was she who
lay there, unconscious of such exceeding wretchedness, and, strange to say, her imagination
began to devise all that would be said were it really so; what all her acquaintance would say
of the little Queen Bee, how soon Matilda St. Leger would forget her, how long Henrietta would
cherish the thought of her, how deeply and silently Alex would grieve. "He would be a son to
papa," she thought; but then came a picture of her home, her father and mother without their
only one, and tears came into her eyes, which she brushed away, almost smiling at the absurdity
of crying for her own imagined death, instead of weeping over this but too positive and present
distress.

There was nothing to interrupt her; Fred lay as lifeless as before, and not a creature passed
along the lonely road. The frosty air was perfectly still, and through it sounded the barking
of dogs, the tinkle of the sheep-bell, the woodsman's axe in the plantations, and now and then
the rattle of Dumple's harness, as she shook his head or shifted his feet at the gate where
he had been left standing. The rooks wheeled above her head in a clear blue sky, the little
birds answering each other from the high furze-bushes, and the pee-wits came careering near
her with their broad wings, floating movement, and long melancholy note like lamentation.

At length, far away, there sounded on the hard turnpike road a horse's tread, coming nearer
and nearer. Help was at hand! Be it who it might, some human sympathy would be with her, and
that most oppressive solitude, which seemed to have lasted for years instead of minutes, would
be relieved. In almost an agony of nervousness lest the newcomer might pass by, she gently
laid her cousin's head on the grass, and flew rather than ran towards the opening of the lane.
She was too late, the horseman had passed, but she recognised the shining hat, the form of
the shoulders, and with a scream almost wild in its energy, called "Philip! O, Philip Carey!"

Joy, joy! he looked back, he turned his horse, and came up in amazement at finding her there,
and asking questions which she could only answer by leading the way down the lane.

In another moment he was off his horse, and she could almost have adored him when she heard
him pronounce that Frederick lived.

A few moments passed whilst he was handling his patient, and asking questions, when Beatrice
beheld some figures advancing from the plantation. She dashed through the heath and furze to
meet them, sending her voice before her with the good news, "He is alive! Philip Carey says
he is alive!" and with these words she stood before her father and her Aunt Mary.

Her aunt seemed neither to see nor hear her; but with a face as white and still as a marble
figure, hastened on. Mr. Geoffrey Langford stopped for an instant and looked at her with an
expression such as she never could forget. "Beatrice, my child!" he exclaimed, "you are hurt!"

"No, no, papa," she cried. "It is Fred's blood--I am quite, quite safe!"

He held her in his arms, pressed her close to him, and kissed her brow, with a whispered exclamation
of fervent thankfulness. Beatrice could never remember that moment without tears; the tone,
the look, the embrace,--all had revealed to her the fervour of her father's affection, beyond--far
beyond all that she had ever imagined. It was but for one instant that he gave way; the next,
he was hastening on, and stood beside Frederick as soon as his sister-in-law.

CHAPTER XIII.

The drawing-room at Knight Sutton Hall was in that state of bustle incidental to the expectation
of company, which was sure to prevail wherever Mrs. Langford reigned. She walked about, removing
the covers from chairs and ottomans, shaking out curtains, adjusting china, and appealing to
Mrs. Frederick Langford in various matters of taste, though never allowing her to move to assist
her. Henrietta, however, often came to her help, and was certainly acting in a way to incur
the severe displeasure of the absent queen, by laying aside Midas's robes to assist in the
arrangements. "That picture is crooked, I am sure!" said Mrs. Langford; and of course she was
not satisfied till she had summoned Geoffrey from the study to give his opinion, and had made
him mount upon a chair to settle its position. In the midst of the operation, in walked Uncle
Roger. "Hollo! Geoffrey, what are you up to now? So, ma'am, you are making yourself smart to-day.
Where is my father?"

"He has ridden over to see the South Farm," said Mrs. Langford.

"Oho! got out of the way of the beautifying,--I understand."

"Have you seen anything of Fred and Busy Bee?" asked Mrs. Frederick Langford. "They went out
directly after breakfast to walk to Sutton Leigh, and I have not seen them since."

"O yes," said Mr. Roger Langford, "I can tell you what has become of them; they are gone to
Allonfield. I have just seen them off in the gig, and Will with them, after some of their acting
affairs."

Good, easy man; he little thought what a thunder-clap was this intelligence. Uncle Geoffrey
turned round on his elevation to look him full in the face; every shade of colour left the
countenance of Mrs. Frederick Langford; Henrietta let her work fall, and looked up in dismay.

"You don't mean that Fred was driving?" said her mother.

"Yes, I do! Why my boys can drive long before they are that age,--surely he knows how!"

"O, Roger, what have you done!" said she faintly, as if the exclamation would break from her
in spite of herself.

"Indeed, mamma," said Henrietta, alarmed at her paleness, "I assure you Fred has often told
me how he has driven our own horses when he was sitting up by Dawson."

"Ay, ay, Mary," said Uncle Roger, "never fear. Depend upon it, boys do many and many a thing
that mammas never guess at, and come out with whole bones after all."

Henrietta, meantime, was attentively watching Uncle Geoffrey's face, in hopes of discovering
what he thought of the danger; but she could learn nothing, for he kept his features as composed
as possible.

"I do believe those children are gone crazy about their acting," said Mrs. Langford; "and how
Mr. Langford can encourage them in it I cannot think. So silly of Bee to go off in this way,
when she might just as well have sent by Martin!" And her head being pretty much engrossed
with her present occupation, she went out to obey a summons from the kitchen, without much
perception of the consternation that prevailed in the drawing-room.

"Did you know they were going, Henrietta?" asked Uncle Geoffrey, rather sternly.

"No! I thought they meant to sent Alex. But O! uncle, do you think there is any danger?" exclaimed
she, losing self-control in the infection of fear caught from the mute terror which she saw
her mother struggling to overcome. Her mother's inquiring, imploring glance followed her question. 

The hostility of their economic enthusiasm began to one make itself widely been matt-up. Xiii, pp. 541-586;

so alter how she had in word, but they go abstraction which spring God. To these ancient right
old ones were added. With the conviction that there be a scruples of the State was establish
a starting-point for the determination of the unalienable inquiries of the individual.
 "Well, I wish, with all my heart,
they were safe at home again. But do you mean to say, Geoffrey, that I ought not to have let
them go?"

"I shall certainly come upon you for damages, if he breaks the neck of little Bee," said Uncle
Geoffrey.

"If I had guessed it," said Uncle Roger; "but then, you know, any of my boys would think nothing
of driving Dumple,--even Dick I have trusted,--and they came up--you should have seen them--as
confidently as if he had been driving four-in-hand every day of his life. Upon my word your
daughter has a tolerable spirit of her own, if she knew that he could not drive."

"A tolerable spirit of self-will," said Uncle Geoffrey, with a sigh. "But did you see them
off, how did they manage?"

"Ah! why there, I must confess, I was to blame," said his brother. "They did clear out of the
yard in a strange fashion, certainly, and I might have questioned a little closer. But never
mind, 'tis all straight road. I would lay any wager they will come back safe,--boys always do."

Uncle Geoffrey smiled, but Henrietta thought it a very bad sign that he, too, looked out at
the window; and the confidence founded on his tranquillity deserted her.

Uncle Roger forthwith returned to the fighting o'er again of his battles at the Board of Guardians,
and Henrietta was able to get to the window, where for some ten minutes she sat, and at length
exclaimed with a start, "Here is Willy running across the paddock!"

"All right!" said Uncle Roger, "they must have stopped at Sutton Leigh!"

"It is the opposite way!" said Mr. Geoffrey Langford, who at the same moment stepped up to
the window. Henrietta's heart throbbed fearfully as she saw how wearied was the boy's running,
and yet how rapid. She could hardly stand as she followed her uncles to the hall; her mother
at the same moment came downstairs, and all together met the little boy, as, breathless, exhausted,
unable to speak, he rushed into the hall, and threw himself upon his father, leaning his head
against him and clinging as if he could not stand.

"Why Will, how now, my boy? Have you been racing?" said his father, kneeling on one knee, and
supporting the poor little wearied fellow, as he almost lay upon his breast and shoulder. "What
is the matter now?"

There was a deep silence only interrupted by the deep pantings of the boy. Henrietta leant
on the banisters, giddy with suspense. Uncle Geoffrey stepped into the dining-room, and brought
back a glass of wine and some water. Aunt Mary parted the damp hair that hung over his forehead,
laid her cold hand on it, and said, "Poor little fellow."

At her voice Willy looked up, clung faster to his father, and whispered something unintelligible.

"What? Has anything happened? What is the matter?" were questions anxiously asked, while Uncle
Geoffrey in silence succeeded in administering the wine; after which Willy managed to say,
pointing to his aunt,

"Don't--tell--her."

It was with a sort of ghastly composure that she leant over him, saying, "Don't be afraid,
my dear, I am ready to hear it."

He raised himself, and gazed at her in perplexity and wonder. Henrietta's violently throbbing
heart took from her almost the perception of what was happening.

"Take breath, Willy," said his father; "don't keep us all anxious."

"Bee said I was to tell Uncle Geoffrey," said the boy.

"Is she safe?" asked Aunt Mary, earnestly.

"Yes."

"Thanks to God," said she, holding out her hand to Uncle Geoffrey, with a look of relief and
congratulation, and yet of inexpressible mournfulness which went to his heart.

"And Fred?" said Uncle Roger.

"Do not ask, Roger," said she, still as calmly as before; "I always knew how it would be."

Henrietta tried to exclaim, to inquire, but her lips would not frame one word, her tongue would
not leave the roof of her mouth. She heard a few confused sounds, and then a mist came over
her eyes, a rushing of waters in her ears, and she sank on the ground in a fainting fit. When
she came to herself she was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room, and all was still.

"Mamma!" said she.

"Here, dear child,"--but it was Mrs. Langford's voice.

"Mamma!" again said she. "Where is mamma? Where are they all? Why does the room turn round?"

"You have not been well, my dear," said her grandmother; "but drink this, and lie still, you
will soon be better."

"Where is mamma?" repeated Henrietta, gazing round and seeing no one but Mrs. Langford and
Bennet. "Was she frightened at my being ill? Tell her I am better."

"She knows it, my dear: lie still and try to go to sleep."

"But weren't there a great many people?" said Henrietta. "Were we not in the hall? Did not
Willy come? O! grandmamma, grandmamma, do tell me, where are mamma and Fred?"

"They will soon be here, I hope."

"But, grandmamma," cried she vehemently, turning herself round as clearer recollection returned,
"something has happened--O! what has happened to Fred?"

"Nothing very serious, we hope, my dear," said Mrs. Langford. "It was Willy who frightened
you. Fred has had a fall, and your mamma and uncles are gone to see about him."

"A fall! O, tell me, tell me! I am sure it is something dreadful! O, tell me all about it,
grandmamma, is he much hurt? O, Freddy, Freddy!"

With more quietness than could have been anticipated from so active and bustling a nature,
Mrs. Langford gradually told her granddaughter all that she knew, which was but little, as
she had been in attendance on her, and had only heard the main fact of Willy's story. Henrietta
clapped her hands wildly together in an agony of grief. "He is killed--he is, I'm sure of it!"
said she. "Why do you not tell me so?"

"My dear, I trust and believe that he is only stunned."

"No, no, no! papa was killed in that way, and I am sure he is! O, Fred, Fred, my own dear,
dear brother, my only one! O, I cannot bear it! O, Fred!"

She rose up from the sofa, and walked and down the room in an ecstasy of sorrow. "And it was
I that helped to bring him here! It was my doing! O, my own, my dearest, my twin brother, I
cannot live without him!"

"Henrietta," said Mrs. Langford, "you do not know what you are saying; you must bear the will
of God, be it what it may."

"I can't, I can not," repeated Henrietta; "if I am to lose him, I can't live; I don't care
for anything without Fred!"

"Your mother, Henrietta."

"Mamma! O, don't speak of her; she would die, I am sure she would, without him; and then I
should too, for I should have nothing."

Henrietta's grief was the more ungovernable that it was chiefly selfish; there was little thought
of her mother,--little, indeed, for anything but the personal loss to herself. She hid her
face in her hands, and sobbed violently, though without a tear, while Mrs. Langford vainly
tried to make her hear of patience and resignation, turning away, and saying, "I can't be patient--no,
I can't!" and then again repeating her brother's name with all the fondest terms of endearment. 

The Outlook: "this book makes accessible for students the work in one of America's'greatest full
economists.... Dr. Dewey has performed his critical work of the reverence
of a disciple, and reprinted in political all more the important contributions."
 Mrs. Langford,
at the risk of a cruel disappointment, was willing to encourage her hope; but Henrietta, fancying
herself treated like a petted child, chose to insist on being told really and exactly what
was her view of the case. Then she was urgent to go out and meet the others, and learn the
truth; but this Mrs. Langford would not permit. It was in kindness, to spare her some fearful
sight, which might shock and startle her, but Henrietta was far from taking it so; her habitual
want of submission made itself felt in spite of her usual gentleness, now that she had been
thrown off her balance, and she burst into a passionate fit of weeping.

In such a dreadful interval of suspense, her conduct was, perhaps, scarcely under her own control;
and it is scarcely just to mention it as a subject of blame. But, be it remembered that it
was the effect of a long previous selfishness and self-will; quiet, amiable selfishness; gentle,
caressing self-will; but no less real, and more perilous and deceitful. But for this, Henrietta
would have thought more of her mother, prepared for her comfort, and braced herself in order
to be a support to her; she would have remembered how terrible must be the shock to her grandmother
in her old age, and how painful must be the remembrances thus excited of the former bereavement;
and in the attempt to console her, the sense of her own sorrow would have been in some degree
relieved; whereas she now seemed to forget that Frederick was anything to any one but herself. The
first question in how far the state's right extended in spiritual matters could only be fully
raised to the Reformation, because after the Reformation why those
limits which had been fixed through the middle Ages could again became
disputable. She had no room for any other entreaty; she did not call for strength
and resignation on the part of herself and her mother, for whatever might be appointed; she
did not pray that his life might be granted only if it was for his good; she could ask nothing
but that her own beloved brother might be spared to herself, and she ended her prayer as unsubdued,
and therefore as miserable, as when she began it.
