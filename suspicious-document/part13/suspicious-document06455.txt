WIFE, a, is the love of a wise man's wisdom, 56. She represents the love of her husband's wisdom,
21. The wife signifies the good of truth, 76. In heaven, the wife is the love of her husband's
wisdom, and the husband is the wisdom of her love, 75. The wife perceives, sees, and is sensible
of the things which are in her husband, in herself, and thence as it were herself in him, 173.
Conjugial love resides with chaste wives, but still their love depends on the husband's, 216*.
Wives love the bonds of marriage if the men do, 217. Wives seated on a bed of roses, 293. In
a rosary, 294. Acts which certain wives employ to subject their husbands to their own authority,
292. See Woman, Married Partners.

WILL, the, is the receptacle of love, for what a man loves that he wills, 347. Will principle,
considered in itself, is nothing but an affect and effect of some love, 461. Whoever conjoins
to himself the will of a man, conjoins to himself the whole man, 196. The will acts by the
body, wherefore, if the will were to be taken away, action would be instantly at a stand, 494.

WILL and UNDERSTANDING.--The will is the man himself, and the understanding is the man as grounded
in the will, 490. The life of man essentially is his will, and formally is his understanding,
493. The will is the receptacle of good, and the understanding is the receptacle of truth,
121. Love, charity, and affection, belong to the will, and perception and thought to the understanding,
121. All things which are done by a man are done from his will and understanding, and without
these acting principles a man would not have either action or speech, otherwise than as a machine,
527. Whoever conjoins to himself the will of another, conjoins also to himself his understanding,
196. The understanding is not so constant in its thoughts as the will is in its affections,
221. He that does not discriminate between will and understanding, cannot discriminate between
evils and goods. 490. The will alone of itself acts nothing, but whatever it acts, it acts
by the understanding, and the understanding alone of itself acts nothing, but whatever it acts,
it acts from the will, 490. In adultery of the reason, the understanding acts from within,
and the will from without, but in adultery of the will, the will acts from within, and the
understanding from without, 490.

WISDOM is nothing but a form of love, 493. It is a principle of life, 130. Wisdom, considered
in its fulness, is a principle, at the same time, of knowledges, of reason, and of life, 130.
What wisdom is as a principle of life, 130, 293. Wisdom consists of truths, 84. The understanding
is the receptacle of wisdom, 400. The abode of wisdom is in use, 18. Wisdom cannot exist with
a man but by means of the love of growing wise, 88. Wisdom of wives, 208. Wisdom and conjugial
love are inseparable companions, 98. The Lord provides conjugial love for those who desire
wisdom, and who consequently advance more and more into wisdom, 98. There is no end to wisdom,
185. Temple of wisdom, 56. Sports of wisdom, 182, 151*. See Love and Wisdom.

WISE.--A wise one is not a wise one without a woman, or without love, a wife being the love
of a wise man's wisdom, 56.

WOMAN, the, was created and born to become the love of the understanding of a man, 55, 91.
Woman was created out of the man, hence she has an inclination to unite, and, as it were, reunite
herself with the man, 173. Conjugial love is implanted in every woman from creation, 409. Woman
is actually formed into a wife, according to the description in the book of creation, 193.
In the universe nothing was created more perfect than a woman of a beautiful countenance and
becoming manners, 56. The woman receives from the man the truth of the church, 125. Woman,
by a peculiar property with which she is gifted from her birth, draws back the internal affections
into the inner recesses of her mind, 274. Affection, application, manners, and form of woman,
91, 218. Women were created by the Lord affections of the wisdom of men, 56. They are created
forms of the love of the understanding of men, 187. Women have an interior perception of love,
and men only an exterior, 47*. In assemblies where the conversation of the men turns on subjects
proper to rational wisdom, women are silent, and listen only, the reason why, 165. Intelligence
of wisdom, 218. Women cannot enter into the duties proper to men, 175. Difference between females,
women, and wives, 199. See Wife.

516. The Word is the medium of conjunction of the Lord with man, and of man with the Lord,
128. It is the perfect marriage of good and truth, 128. The sanctity of the Word resides in
this sense, 5-32.

WORKHOUSES, infernal, 264. See also 54, 80, 461.

WORKS are good or bad, according as they proceed from an upright will and thought, or from
a depraved will and thought, whatever may be their appearance in externals, 527. Good works
are uses, 10.

WORLD OF SPIRITS, the, is intermediate between heaven and hell, and there the good are prepared
for heaven, and the wicked for hell, 48*, 436, 461, 477. It is in the world of spirits that
all men are first collected after their departure out of the natural world, 2, 477.

WORLD, the natural, subsists from its sun, which is pure fire, 380. There is not anything in
the natural world which is not also in the spiritual world, 182, 207.

WORLD, the spiritual, subsists from its sun, which is pure love, as the natural world subsists
from its sun, 380. In the spiritual world there are not spaces, but appearances of spaces,
and these appearances are according to the states of life of the inhabitants, 50. All things
there appear according to correspondences, 76. In the spiritual world there are all such things
there as there are on earth, and those things in the heavens are infinitely more perfect, 182.
