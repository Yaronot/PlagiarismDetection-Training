GONE FISHING

                         By JAMES H. SCHMITZ

    There is no predictable correlation between intelligence and
     ethics, nor is ruthlessness necessarily an evil thing. And
     there is nothing like enforced, uninterrupted contemplation
     to learn to distinguish one from another....

Barney Chard, thirty-seven--financier, entrepreneur, occasional blackmailer, occasional con
man, and very competent in all these activities--stood on a rickety wooden lake dock, squinting
against the late afternoon sun, and waiting for his current business prospect to give up the
pretense of being interested in trying to catch fish. 

He travel, thus, to McAllen and he seek way'bequest; he was tailored to artist as he should be more
men by himself. He need thus give up his studio, and as his patron, Chard, had frequently be left

Ergo again, McAllen's thoughts must be running, how might one not merely coax Mr. Chard into
silence, but actually get him to come through with some much-needed financial support? What
inducement, aside from the Tube, could be offered someone in his position?

Barney grinned inwardly as he snapped the end of his cigarette out on the amber-tinted water.
The mark always sells himself, and McAllen was well along in the process. Polite silence was
all that was necessary at the moment. He lit a fresh cigarette, feeling a mild curiosity about
the little lake's location. Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan seemed equally probable guesses.
What mattered was that half an hour ago McAllen's Tube had brought them both here in a wink
of time from his home in California.

Dr. McAllen thoughtfully cleared his throat.

"Ever do any fishing, Mr. Chard?" he asked. After getting over his first shock at Barney's
revelations, he'd begun speaking again in the brisk, abrupt manner Barney remembered from the
last times he'd heard McAllen's voice.

"No," Barney admitted smiling. "Never quite got around to it."

"Always been too busy, eh?"

"With this and that," Barney agreed.

McAllen cleared his throat again. He was a roly-poly little man; over seventy now but still
healthy-looking, with an apple-cheeked, sunburned face. Over a pair of steel-rimmed glasses
his faded blue eyes peered musingly at Barney. "Around thirty-five, aren't you?"

"Thirty-seven."

"Married?"

"Divorced."

"Any particular hobbies?"

Barney laughed. "I play a little golf. Not very seriously."

McAllen clicked his tongue. "Well, what do you do for fun?"

"Oh ... I'd say I enjoy almost anything I get involved in." Barney, still smiling, felt a touch
of wariness. He'd been expecting questions from McAllen, but not quite this kind.

"Mainly making money, eh? Well," McAllen conceded, "that's not a bad hobby. Practical, too.
I ... whup! Just a moment."

The tip of the slender rod in his left hand dipped slightly, and sixty feet out beyond the
end of the old dock a green and white bobber began twitching about. Then the bobber suddenly
disappeared. McAllen lifted the rod tip a foot or two with a smooth, swift motion, and paused.

"Hooked!" he announced, looking almost childishly pleased.

The fish on the far end of the line didn't seem to put up much of a struggle, but the old man
reeled it in slowly and carefully, giving out line from time to time, then taking it back.
He seemed completely absorbed. Not until the fish had been worked close to the dock was there
a brief minor commotion near the surface. Then McAllen was down on one knee, holding the rod
high with one hand, reaching out for his catch with the other. Barney had a glimpse of an unimpressive
green and silver disk, reddish froggy eyes. "Very nice crappie!" McAllen informed him with
a broad smile. "Now--" He placed the rod on the dock, reached down with his other hand. The
fish's tail slapped the water; it turned sideways, was gone.

"Lost it!" Barney commented, surprised.

"Huh?" McAllen looked around. "Well, no, young man--I turned him loose. He wasn't hooked bad.
Crappies have delicate lips, but I use a barbless hook. Gives them better than a fighting chance."
He stood up with the rod, dusting the knees of his baggy slacks. "Get all the eating fish I
want anyway," he added.

"You really enjoy that sport, don't you?" Barney said curiously.

       *       *       *       *       *

McAllen advised him with the seriousness of the true devotee to try it some time. "It gets
to you. It can get to be a way of living. I've been fishing since I was knee-high. Three years
ago I figured I'd become good enough to write a book on the subject. I got more arguments over
that book--sounder arguments too, I'd say--than about any paper I've published in physics."
He looked at Barney a moment, still seriously, and went on. "I told you wetting a line would
calm me down after that upset you gave me. Well, it has--fishing is as good a form of therapy
as I know about. Now I've been doing some thinking. I'd be interested ... well, I'd like to
talk some more about the Tube with you, Mr. Chard. And perhaps about other things too."

"Very gratifying to hear that, doctor," Barney said gravely. "I did regret having to upset
you, you know."

McAllen shrugged. "No harm done. It's given me some ideas. We'll talk right here." He indicated
the weather-beaten little cabin on the bank behind Barney. "I'm not entirely sure about the
California place. That's one reason I suggested this trip."

"You feel your houseman there mightn't be entirely reliable?"

"Fredericks unreliable? Heavens no! He knows about the Tube, of course, but Fredericks expects
me to invent things. It wouldn't occur to him to talk to an outsider. He's been with me for
almost forty years."

"He was," remarked Barney, "listening in on the early part of our conversation today."

"Well, he'll do that," McAllen agreed. "He's very curious about anyone who comes to see me.
But otherwise ... no, it's just that in these days of sophisticated listening devices one shouldn't
ever feel too sure of not being overheard."

"True enough." Barney glanced up at the cabin. "What makes you so sure of it here, doctor?"

"No reason why anyone would go to the trouble," McAllen said. "The property isn't in my name.
And the nearest neighbor lives across the lake. I never come here except by the Tube so I don't
attract any attention."

He led the way along the dock. Barney Chard followed, eyes reflectively on the back of McAllen's
sunburned neck and the wisps of unclipped white hair sticking out beneath his beaked fishing
cap. Barney had learned to estimate accurately the capacity for physical violence in people
he dealt with. He would have offered long odds that neither Dr. McAllen nor Fredericks, the
elderly colored man of all work, had the capacity. But Barney's right hand, slid idly into
the pocket of his well-tailored coat, was resting on a twenty-five caliber revolver. This was,
after all, a very unusual situation. The human factors in themselves were predictable. Human
factors were Barney's specialty. But here they were involved with something unknown--the McAllen
Tube.

When it was a question of his personal safety, Barney Chard preferred to take no chances at all.

From the top of the worn wooden steps leading up to the cabin, he glanced back at the lake.
It occurred to him there should have been at least a suggestion of unreality about that placid
body of water, and the sun low and red in the west beyond it. Not that he felt anything of
the kind. But less than an hour ago they had been sitting in McAllen's home in Southern California,
and beyond the olive-green window shades it had been bright daylight.

"But I can't ... I really can't imagine," Dr. McAllen had just finished bumbling, his round
face a study of controlled dismay on the other side of the desk, "whatever could have brought
you to these ... these extraordinary conclusions, young man."

Barney had smiled reassuringly, leaning back in his chair. "Well, indirectly, sir, as the pictures
indicate, we might say it was your interest in fishing. You see, I happened to notice you on
Mallorca last month...."

       *       *       *       *       *

By itself, the chance encounter on the island had seemed only moderately interesting. Barney
was sitting behind the wheel of an ancient automobile, near a private home in which a business
negotiation of some consequence was being conducted. The business under discussion happened
to be Barney's, but it would have been inexpedient for him to attend the meeting in person.
Waiting for his associates to wind up the matter, he was passing time by studying an old man
who was fishing from a small boat offshore, a hundred yards or so below the road. After a while
the old fellow brought the boat in, appeared a few minutes later along the empty lane carrying
his tackle and an apparently empty gunny sack, and trudged unheedingly past the automobile
and its occupant. As he went by, Barney had a sudden sense of recognition. Then, in a flash,
his mind jumped back twelve years.

Dr. Oliver B. McAllen. Twelve years ago the name had been an important one in McAllen's field;
then it was not so much forgotten as deliberately buried. Working under government contract
at one of the big universities, McAllen had been suddenly and quietly retired. Barney, who
had a financial interest in one of the contracts, had made inquiries; he was likely to be out
of money if McAllen had been taken from the job. Eventually he was informed, in strict confidence,
that Dr. McAllen had flipped. Under the delusion of having made a discovery of tremendous importance,
he had persuaded the authorities to arrange a demonstration. When the demonstration ended in
complete failure, McAllen angrily accused some of his most eminent colleagues of having sabotaged
his invention, and withdrew from the university. To protect a once great scientist's name,
the matter was being hushed up.

So Mallorca was where the addled old physicist had elected to end his days--not a bad choice
either, Barney had thought, gazing after the retreating figure. Pleasant island in a beautiful
sea--he remembered having heard about McAllen's passion for angling.

A day later, the Mallorca business profitably concluded, Barney flew back to Los Angeles. That
evening he entertained a pair of tanned and shapely ladies whose idea of high fun was to drink
all night and go deep-sea fishing at dawn. Barney shuddered inwardly at the latter notion,
but promised to see the sporting characters to the Sweetwater Beach Municipal Pier in time
to catch a party boat, and did so. One of the girls, he noticed not without satisfaction--he
had become a little tired of the two before morning--appeared to turn a delicate green as she
settled herself into the gently swaying half-day boat beside the wharf. Barney waved them an
amiable farewell and was about to go when he noticed a plump old man sitting in the stern of
the boat among other anglers, rigging up his tackle. Barney checked sharply, and blinked. He
was looking at Oliver B. McAllen again.

It was almost a minute before he felt sure of it this time. Not that it was impossible for
McAllen to be sitting in that boat, but it did seem extremely unlikely. McAllen didn't look
in the least like a man who could afford nowadays to commute by air between the Mediterranean
and California. And Barney felt something else trouble him obscurely as he stared down at the
old scientist; a notion of some kind was stirring about in the back corridors of his mind,
but refused to be drawn to view just then.

       *       *       *       *       *

He grew aware of what it was while he watched the party boat head out to sea a few minutes
later, smiled at what seemed an impossibly fanciful concoction of his unconscious, and started
towards the pier's parking lot. But when he had reached his car, climbed in, turned on the
ignition, and lit a cigarette, the notion was still with him and Barney was no longer smiling.
Fanciful it was, extremely so. At eleven o water whether he retired to his the room and amused himself with
a book or pencil before kip. He entertained them heartily, but to gaudery, and lead into the
conversation without light, depressing message that did not stir
of art, or demand mental effort.

Later Barney realized he would still have let the matter drop there if it hadn't been for other
things, having nothing to do with Dr. McAllen. He was between operations at present. His time
wasn't occupied. Furthermore he'd been aware lately that ordinary operations had begun to feel
flat. The kick of putting over a deal, even on some other hard, bright character of his own
class, unaccountably was fading. Barney Chard was somewhat frightened because the operator
game was the only one he'd ever found interesting; the other role of well-heeled playboy wasn't
much more than a manner of killing time. At thirty-seven he was realizing he was bored with
life. He didn't like the prospect.

Now here was something which might again provide him with some genuine excitement. It could
be simply his imagination working overtime, but it wasn't going to do any harm to find out.
Mind humming with pleased though still highly skeptical speculations, Barney went back to the
boat station and inquired when the party boat was due to return.

He was waiting for it, well out of sight, as it came chugging up to the wharf some hours later.
He had never had anything to do directly with Dr. McAllen, so the old man wouldn't recognize
him. But he didn't want to be spotted by his two amazons who might feel refreshed enough by
now to be ready for another tour of the town.
