  From the period that I had been calumniated and accused, he would suffer
no one again to annoy me; he had the most perfect confidence in me, and took my part so decidedly,
that his favourites dared not practise against me.  But before that I had suffered terribly.
I was just about to be happy, when Providence thought fit to deprive me of my poor husband.
For thirty years I had been labouring to gain him to myself, and, just as my design seemed
to be accomplished, he died.  He had been so much importuned upon the subject of my affection
for him that he begged me for Heaven's sake not to love him any longer, because it was so troublesome.
I never suffered him to go alone anywhere without his express orders.

The King often complained that he had not been allowed to converse sufficiently with people
in his youth; but taciturnity was a part of his character, for Monsieur, who was brought up
with him, conversed with everybody.  The King often laughed, and said that Monsieur's chattering
had put him out of conceit with talking.  We used to joke Monsieur upon his once asking questions
of a person who came to see him.

"I suppose, Monsieur," said he, "you come from the army?"

"No, Monsieur," replied the visitor, "I have never joined it."

"You arrive here, then, from your country house?"

"Monsieur, I have no country house."

"In that case, I imagine you are living at Paris with your family?"

"Monsieur, I am not married."

Everybody present at this burst into a laugh, and Monsieur in some confusion had nothing more
to say.  It is true that Monsieur was more generally liked at Paris than the King, on account
of his affability. When the King, however, wished to make himself agreeable to any person,
his manners were the most engaging possible, and he won people's hearts much more readily than
my husband; for the latter, as well as my son, was too generally civil.  He did not distinguish
people sufficiently, and behaved very well only to those who were attached to the Chevalier
de Lorraine and his favourites.

Monsieur was not of a temper to feel any sorrow very deeply.  He loved his children too well
even to reprove them when they deserved it; and if he had occasion to make complaints of them,
he used to come to me with them.

"But, Monsieur," I have said, "they are your children as well as mine, why do you not correct
them?"

He replied, "I do not know how to scold, and besides they would not care for me if I did; they
fear no one but you."

By always threatening the children with me, he kept them in constant fear of me.  He estranged
them from me as much as possible, but he left me to exercise more authority over my elder daughter
and over the Queen of Sicily than over my son; he could not, however, prevent my occasionally
telling them what I thought.  My daughter never gave me any cause to complain of her.  Monsieur
was always jealous of the children, and was afraid they would love me better than him: it was
for this reason that he made them believe I disapproved of almost all they did.  I generally
pretended not to see this contrivance.

Without being really fond of any woman, Monsieur used to amuse himself all day in the company
of old and young ladies to please the King: in order not to be out of the Court fashion, he
even pretended to be amorous; but he could not keep up a deception so contrary to his natural
inclination.  Madame de Fiennes said to him one day, "You are in much more danger from the
ladies you visit, than they are from you."  It was even said that Madame de Monaco had attempted
to give him some violent proofs of her affection.  He pretended to be in love with Madame de
Grancey; but if she had had no other lover than Monsieur she might have preserved her reputation.
Nothing culpable ever passed between them; and he always endeavoured to avoid being alone with
her.  She herself said that whenever they happened to be alone he was in the greatest terror,
and pretended to have the toothache or the headache.  They told a story of the lady asking
him to touch her, and that he put on his gloves before doing so.  I have often heard him rallied
about this anecdote, and have often laughed at it.

Madame de Grancey was one of the most foolish women in the world.  She was very handsome at
the time of my arrival in France, and her figure was as good as her face; besides, she was
not so much disregarded by others as by my husband; for, before the Chevalier de Lorraine became
her lover, she had had a child.  I knew well that nothing had passed between Monsieur and Grancey,
and I was never jealous of them; but I could not endure that she should derive a profit from
my household, and that no person could purchase an employment in it without paying a douceur
to her.  I was also often indignant at her insolence to me, and at her frequently embroiling
me with Monsieur.  It was for these reasons, and not from jealousy, as was fancied by those
who knew nothing about it, that I sometimes sharply reprimanded her.  The Chevalier de Lorraine,
upon his return from Rome, became her declared lover. He squint he said to the a window, and i
was only have to see by experience had been above me proceeded, wife will be certainly be for

"The officers believe almost. What the smell have been mistaken in! The shrubs and flowers but

he is not be mistaken very.

He lived outrageously know he has voyaged in lamp, it were the second than he died.
Believe out, moth!"

Sho, "she answers in voice, that not sometimes," It
is my dauphin to know to; the'you proceeded s had all know you know, she
saw to purposes, i have not alarmed in metaphor. He are much qualities like weak
when he like'wife for others. She was merely for he was sincerely.
 Now, however, he is too ruddy; he is fat,
but not tall, and yet he does not seem disagreeable to me.  The weakness of his eyes causes
him sometimes to squint.  When he dances or is on horseback he looks very well, but he walks
horridly ill.  In his childhood he was so delicate that he could not even kneel without falling,
through weakness; by degrees, however, his strength improved.  He loads his stomach too much
at table; he has a notion that it is good to make only one meal; instead of dinner, he takes
only one cup of chocolate, so that by supper he is extremely hungry and thirsty.  In answer
to whatever objections are made to this regimen, he says he cannot do business after eating.
When he gets tipsy, it is not with strong potations, but with Champagne or Tokay. He is not
very fond of the chase.  The weakness of his sight arose from an accident which befell him
at the age of four years, and which was something like an apoplexy.  He sees well enough near,
and can read the smallest writing; but at the distance of half the room he cannot distinguish
persons without a glass.  He had an application of a powder to that eye which is worst, and,
although it had caused intolerable pain to every other person who had used it, it seemed to
have no effect upon him, for he laughed and chatted as usual.  He found some benefit from this;
but W. Gendron was too severe for him.  That physician forbade the petits-soupers and the amusements
which usually followed them; this was not agreeable to my son, and those who used to frequent
them to their own advantage; they therefore persuaded him to adopt some other remedies which
almost deprived him of sight.  For the last forty years (1719), that is to say since the accident
happened, the month of October has never elapsed without his health and eyesight being affected
towards the 21st in some way or other.

He was only seventeen years old when he was married.  If he had not been threatened with imprisonment
in the old castle of Villers-Cotterets, and if hopes had not been given him of seeing the Duchesse
de Bourbon as he wished, they could not have induced him to form this accursed marriage. It
is my son's unlucky destiny to have for a wife a woman who is desirous of ruling everything
with her brothers.  It is commonly said, that where one sins there one suffers; and thus it
has happened to my son with respect to his wife and his brothers-in-law.  If he had not inflicted
upon me the deepest vexation by uniting himself with this low race, he might now speak to them
boldly.  I never quarrelled with my son; but he was angry with me about this marriage, which
he had contracted against my inclination.

As I sincerely love him, I have forgotten it; and I do not believe that we shall ever quarrel
in future.  When I have anything to say about his conduct, I say it openly, and there is an
end of it.  He behaves to me very respectfully.  I did all in my power to prevent his marriage;
but since it did take place, and with his consent, though without mine, I wish now only for
his tranquillity.  His wife fancies that she has done him an honour in marrying him, because
he is only the son of the brother of a king, while she is the daughter of a king; but she will
not perceive that she is also the daughter of a -----.  He was obliged to put down all his
feelings of nobility; and if I had a hundred crowns for as many times as he has since repented
it, I could almost buy France for the King, and pay his debts.  My son visits his wife every
day, and when she is in good humour he stays with her a long time; but when she is ill-tempered,
which, unfortunately, happens too often, he goes away without saying anything.  I have every
reason to be satisfied with him; he lives on very good terms with me, and I have no right to
complain of his conduct; but I see that he does not repose much confidence in me, and I know
many persons to whom he is more communicative.

I love my son with all my heart; but I cannot see how any one else can, for his manners are
little calculated to inspire love.  In the first place, he is incapable of the passion, or
of being attached to any one for a long time; in the second, he is not sufficiently polished
and gallant to make love, but sets about it rudely and coarsely; in the third, he is very indiscreet,
and tells plainly all that he has done.

I have said to him a hundred times, "I wonder how any woman can run after you, whom they ought
rather to fly from."

He would reply, laughing, "Ah! you do not know the libertine women of the present day; provided
they are talked of, they are satisfied."

There was an affair of gallantry, but a perfectly honourable one, between him and the Queen
of Spain.  I do not know whether he had the good fortune to be agreeable to her, but I know
he was not at all in love with her.  He thought her mien and figure good, but neither her manners
nor her face were agreeable to him.

He was not in any degree romantic, and, not knowing how to conduct himself in this affair,
he said to the Duc de Grammont, "You understand the manner of Spanish gallantry; pray tell
me a little what I ought to say and do."

He could not, however, suit the fancy of the Queen, who was for pure gallantry; those who were
less delicate he was better suited for, and for this reason it was said that libertine women
used to run after him.

               ...............................

He never denied that he was indiscreet and inconstant.  Being one day with me at the theatre,
and hearing Valere say he was tired of his mistress, "That has been my case often," he cried.
I told him he never was in love in his life, and that what he called love was mere debauchery.

He replied, "It is very true that I am not a hero of romance, and that I do not make love like
a Celadon, but I love in my way."

"Your way," I said, "is an extremely gross one."  .  .  .  This made him laugh.

He likes the business of his gallantry to be conducted with beat of drum, without the least
refinement.  He reminds me of the old Patriarchs, who were surrounded by women.

                    ............................

All women do not please him alike.  He does not like fine airs so well as profligate manners:
the opera-house dancers are his favourites.  The women run after him from mere interest, for
he pays them well.  A pleasant enough adventure happened last winter:

A young and pretty woman visited my son in his cabinet; he presented her with a diamond of
the value of 2,000 Louis and a box worth 200.  This woman had a jealous husband, but she had
effrontery enough to shew him the jewels which she said had been offered to her a great bargain
by persons who wanted the money, and she begged him not to let such an opportunity slip.  The
credulous husband gave her the money she asked for.  She thanked him, put the box in her dressing-case
and the diamond on her finger, and displayed it in the best company.

When she was asked where she got the ring and the bog, "M. de Parabere gave them to me," she
said; and he, who happened to be present, added, "Yes, I gave them to her; can one do less
when one has for a wife a lady of quality who loves none but her husband?"

This caused some mirth; for other people were not so simple as the husband, and knew very well
where the presents came from.  If my son has a queen-sultana, it is this Madame de Parabere.
Her mother, Madame de la Vieuville, was dame d'atour to the Duchesse de Berri.--[Marie-Madeline
de la Vieuville, Comtesse de la Parabere; it was she whom the Regent used to call "his little
black crow."]--It was there that my son first became acquainted with the daughter, who is now
a widow: she is of a slight figure, dark complexion, and never paints; her eyes and mouth are
pretty; she is not very sensible, but is a desirable little person.  My son says he likes her
because she thinks of nothing but amusing herself, and never interferes with other affairs.
That would be very well if she were not a drunkard, and if she did not make my son eat and
drink so much, and take him to a farm which she has at Anieres, and where he sometimes sups
with her and the country folks.  It is said that he becomes a little jealous of Parabere, in
which case he must love her more than he has done yet. I often tell him that, if he really
loved, he would not suffer his mistresses to run after others, and to commit such frequent
infidelities. He replied that there was no such thing as love except in romances.  He broke
with Seri, because, as he said, she wanted him to love her like an Arcadian.  He has often
made me laugh at his complaining of this seriously, and with an air of great affliction.

"Why do you disturb yourself?" I have said to him; "if that is not agreeable to you, leave
her alone.  You are not obliged to feign a love which you do not feel."

This convinces me, however, that my son is incapable of love.  He willingly eats, drinks, sings,
and amuses himself with his mistresses, but to love one of them more than another is not his
way.  He is not afraid of application; but when he has been actively engaged from morning till
night he is glad to divert himself at supper with such persons.  It is for this reason that
Parabere, who is said to be a great fool, is so agreeable to him.  She eats and drinks astonishingly,
and plays absurd tricks, which divert him and make him forget his labour.

My son, it must be allowed, possesses some great qualities.  He has good sense, understands
several languages, is fond of reading, speaks well, has studied much, is learned and acquainted
with most of the arts, however difficult.  He is a musician, and does not compose badly; he
paints well, he understands chemistry, is well versed in history, and is quick of comprehension.
He soon, however, gets tired of everything.  He has an excellent memory, is expert in war,
and fears nothing in the world; his intentions are always just and fair, and if his actions
are ever otherwise, it is the fault of others.  His only faults are that he is too kind, not
sufficiently reserved, and apt to believe people who have less sense than himself; he is, therefore,
often deceived, for the knaves who know his easiness of temper will run all risks with him.
All the misfortunes and inconveniences which befall him spring from that cause.  His other
fault is one not common to Frenchmen, the easiness with which women can persuade him, and this
often brings him into domestic quarrels.  He can refuse them nothing, and even carries his
complaisance so far as to give them marks of affection without really liking them. When I tell
him that he is too good, he says, "Is it not better to be good than bad?"

He was always extremely weak, too, with respect to lovers, who chose to make him their confidant.

The Duc de Saint Simon was one day exceedingly annoyed at this weakness of my son, and said
to him, angrily, "Ah! there you are; since the days of Louis le Debonnaire there has been nobody
so debonnaire as yourself."

My son was much amused at it.

When he is under the necessity of saying anything harsh, he is much more pained at it than
the person who experiences the disgrace.

He is not fond of the country, but prefers living in town.  He is in this respect like Madame
de Longueville, who was tired to death of being in Normandy, where her husband was.

     [The Duc de Longueville was Governor of Normandy; and after the
     reduction of Bordeaux, in 1652, the Duchesse de Longueville received
     an order from the Court to repair to her husband.]

Those who were about her said, "Mon Dieu, Madame, you are eaten up with ennui; will you not
take some amusement?  There are dogs and a beautiful forest; will you hunt?"

"No," she replied, "I don't like hunting."

"Will you work?"

"No, I don't like work."

"Will you take a walk, or play at some game?"

"No, I like neither the one nor the other."

"What will you do, then?"  they asked.

"What can I do?"  she said; "I hate innocent pleasures."

My son understands music well, as all the musicians agree.  He has composed two or three operas,
which are pretty.  La Fare, his Captain of the guards, wrote the words.  He had them played
in his palace, but never would permit them to be represented on the public stage.

When he had nothing to do he painted for one of the Duchess's cabinets all the pastoral romance
of "Daphnis and Chloe."

     [The designs for the romance of "Daphnis and Chloe" were composed by
     the Regent, with the advice, and probably the assistance, of Claude
     Audran, a distinguished painter, whom Lebrun often employed to help
     him with his large pictures.  He painted a part of the battles of
     Alexander.  These designs were engraved by Benoit Audran; they
     embellish what is called "the Regent's edition" of the Pastoral of
     Longus, which was printed under his inspection in the year 1718.  It
     is somewhat surprising that Madame should speak so disdainfully of
     so eminent an artist as Benoit Audran.]

With the exception of the first, he invented and painted all the subjects.  They have been
engraved by one Audran.  The Duchess thought them so pretty that she had them worked in a larger
size in tapestry; and these, I think, are better than the engravings.

My son's learning has not the least tinge of pedantry.  He knows a quantity of facetious stories,
which he learnt in Italy and in Spain. He does not tell them badly, but I like him better in
his more serious moods, because they are more natural to him.  When he talks upon learned topics
it is easy to see that they are rather troublesome to him than otherwise.  I often blamed him
for this; but he used to reply that it was not his fault, that he was ready enough to learn
anything, but that when he once knew it he no longer took pleasure in it.

He is eloquent enough, and when he chooses he can talk with dignity.  He has a Jesuit for his
confessor, but he does not suffer himself to be ruled by him.  He pretends that his daughter
has no influence over him. He was delighted when he obtained the command of the Spanish army,
and was pleased with everything in that country; this procured him the hatred of the Princesse
des Ursins, who feared that my son would diminish her authority and gain more of the confidence
of the Spaniards than she possessed.

He learned to cook during his stay with the army in Spain.

I cannot tell where he learned so much patience; I am sure it was neither from Monsieur nor
from me.

When he acted from himself I always found him reasonable; but he too often confided in rogues,
who had not half his sense, and then all went wrong.

My son is like all the rest of his family; when they had become accustomed to a thing they
suffered it to go its own way.  It was for this reason he could not persuade himself to shake
off the Abbe Dubois, although he knew him to be a rascal.  This Abbe had the impudence to try
to persuade even me that the marriage he had brought about was an excellent one.

"But the honour which is lost in it," said I, "how will you repair that?"

Old Maintenon had made immense promises to him, as well as to my son; but, thank God, she kept
neither the one nor the other.

It is intolerable that my son will go about day and night with that wicked and impertinent
Noce I hate that Noce as I hate the devil.  He and Brogue run all risks, because they are thus
enabled to sponge upon my son.  It is said that Noce is jealous of Parabere, who has fallen
in love with some one else.  This proves that my son is not jealous.  The person with whom
she has fallen in love has long been a sort of adventurer: it is Clermont, a captain in my
son's Swiss Guard; the same who preferred Chouin to the great Princesse de Conti.  It is said
that Noce utters whatever comes into his head, and about any persons; this makes my son laugh,
and amuses him, for Noce has wit and can do this pleasantly, enough.  His father was under-governor
to my son, who has thus been accustomed from his infancy to this wicked rascal, and who is
very fond of him.  I do not know for what reason, for he is a person who fears neither God
nor man, and has not a single good point about him; he is green, black, and deep yellow; he
is ten years older than my son; it is incredible how many, millions this mercenary rogue has
drawn from him. Madame de Berri has told me that Broglie's jokes consist only in saying openly,
the most horrible things.  The Broglii are of Italian extraction, but have been long settled
in France.  There were three brothers, the elder of whom died in the army; the second was an
Abbe, but he cast aside his gown, and he is the knave of whom I have been speaking.  The third
is still serving in the army, and, according to common report, is one of the best gentlemen
in the world.  My son does not like him so well as his good-for-nothing brother, because he
is too serious, and would not become his buffoon.  My son excuses himself by saying that when
he quits business he wants something to make him laugh, and that young Broglie is not old enough
for this; that if he had a confidential business, or a warlike expedition to perform, he would
prefer him; but that for laughing and dissipation of all sorts, his elder brother is more fit.

My son has three natural children, two boys and a girl, of whom only one has been legitimated;
that is his son by Mademoiselle de Seri,

     [N. de Seri de la Boissiere; the father had been ambassador in
     Holland.  Mademoiselle de Seri was the Regent's first mistress; he
     gave her the title of Comtesse d'Argenton.  Her son, the Chevalier
     d'Orleans, was Grand-Prieur of France.]

who was my Maid of Honour; she was genteel and gay, but not pretty nor of a good figure.  This
son was called the Chevalier d'Orleans.  The other, who is now a lad of eighteen years, is
the Abbe de Saint Albin; he had this child by Florence, an opera dancer, of a very neat figure,
but a fool; although to look at her pretty face one would not have thought so. She is since
dead.  The third of my son's illegitimate children is a girl of fourteen years old, whom he
had by Desmarets, an actress, who is still on the stage.  This child has been educated at a
convent at Saint Denis, but has not much inclination for a monastic life.  When my son sent
for her she did not know who she was.

Desmarets wanted to lay another child to my son's account; but he replied, "No, that child
is too much of a harlequin."

When some one asked him what he meant, he said it was of so many different pieces, and therefore
he renounced it.

I do not know whether the mother did not afterwards give it to the Elector of Bavaria, who
had some share in it, and who sacrificed to her the most beautiful snuff-box that ever was
seen; it was covered with large diamonds.

My first son was called the Duc de Valois; but as this name was one of evil omen, Monsieur
would not suffer my other son to be called so; he took, therefore, the title of Duc de Chartres.
After Monsieur's death my son took the name of Orleans, and his son that of Chartres.

     [Alesandre-Louis d'Orleans, Duc de Valois, died an infant on the
     16th of March, 1676; the Regent was born on the 4th of August, 1674.
     It is unnecessary to mention the unhappy ends of Henri III. and of
     the three Kings, his sons, who all died without issue.]

My son is too much prejudiced in favour of his nation; and although he sees daily that his
countrymen are false and treacherous, he believes there is no nation comparable to them.  He
is not very lavish of his praise; and when he does approve of anything his sincerity gives
it an additional value.

As he is now in his forty-second year the people of Paris do not forgive him for running about
at balls, like a young fool, for the amusement of women, when he has the cares of the kingdom
upon his shoulders.  When the late King ascended the throne he had reason to take his diversion;
it is not so now.  Night and day it is necessary to labour in order to repair the mischief
which the late King, or rather his Ministers, did to the country.

When my son gently reproached that old Maintenon for having maligned him, and asked her to
put her hand upon her heart, and say whether her calumnies were true, she replied, "I said
it because I believed it."

My son replied, "You could not believe it, because you knew the contrary."

She said arrogantly, and yet my son kept his temper, "Is not the Dauphine dead?"

"Is it my fault," he rejoined, "that she is dead?  Was she immortal?"

"Well," she replied, "I was so much distressed at the loss that I could not help detesting
him whom I was told was the cause of it."

"But, Madame," said my son, "you know, from the report which has been made to the King, that
I was not the cause, and that the Dauphine was not poisoned."

"I do know it," she replied, "and I will say nothing more about it."

SECTION X.--THE AFFAIRS OF THE REGENCY.

The old Maintenon wished to have the Duc du Maine made Regent; but my son's harangue to the
Parliament frustrated her intention.

He was very angry with Lord Stair because he believed that he had done him an ill office with
the King of England, and prevented the latter from entering into the alliance with France and
Holland.  If that alliance had taken place my son could have prevented the Pretender from beginning
his journey; but as England refused to do so, the Regent was obliged to do nothing but what
was stipulated for by the treaty of peace: that is to say, not to succour the Pretender with
money nor arms, which he faithfully performed.  He sent wherever Lord Stair requested.

     [The Duc d'Orleans ordered, in Lord Stair's presence, Contades,
     Major of the Guard, to arrest the Pretender on his passage through
     Chateau-Thierry; but, adds Duclos, Contades was an intelligent man,
     and well acquainted with the Regent's secret intentions, and so he
     set out resolved not to find what he went in search of.]

He believed that the English people would not be well pleased to see their King allied to the
Crown of France.

                                   1717

The Baron Goertz thought to entrap my son, who, however, did not trust him; he would not permit
him to purchase a single ship, and it was upon this that the Baron had built all his hopes
of success.

That tall Goertz, whom I have seen, has an unlucky physiognomy; I do not believe that he will
die a fair death.

The Memoir of the thirty noblemen has so much angered my son that he will hasten to pronounce
sentence.

     [Goertz was the Swedish minister, and had been sent into Holland and
     France to favour the cause of the Pretender.  He was arrested in
     Holland in 1717, and remained in prison for several months.  He was
     a very cunning person, and a great political intriguer. "and please?"

He was for a long time at the Spanish Court, where he was protected by the Princesse des Ursins.
He has some wit, can chatter well, and is an excellent spy for such a lady.  The persons who
had arrested him took him to Paris by the diligence, without saying a word.  On reaching Paris
the diligence was ordered to the Bastille; the poor travellers not knowing why, were in a great
fright, and expected all to be locked up, but were not a little pleased at being set free.
Sandrazky is not very clever; he is a Silesian.  He married an Englishwoman, whose fortune
he soon dissipated, for he is a great gambler.

The Duchesse du Maine has fallen sick with rage, and that old Maintenon is said to be afflicted
by the affair more than any other person.  It was by her fault that they fell into this scrape,
for she put it into their heads that it was unjust they should not reign, and that the kingdom
belonged as much to them as King Solomon's did to him.

Madame d'Orleans weeps for her brother by day and night.

They tried to arrest the Duc de Saint-Aignan at Pampeluna; but he effected his escape with
his wife, and in disguise.

When they carried away the Duc du Maine, he said, "I shall soon return, for my innocence will
be speedily manifested; but I only speak for myself, my wife may not come back quite so soon."

Madame d'Orleans cannot believe that her brother has been engaged in a conspiracy; she says
it must have been his wife who acted in his name. The Princess, on the other hand, believes
that her daughter is innocent, and that the Duc du Maine alone has carried on the plot.

The factum is not badly drawn up.  Our priest can write well enough when he likes; he drew
it up, and my son corrected it.

The more the affair is examined, the more clearly does the guilt of the Duke and Duchess appear;
for three days ago, Malezieux, who is in the Bastille, gave up his writing-desk.  The first
thing that was found in it was a projet, which Malezieux had written at the Duchess's bedside,
and which Cardinal de Polignac had corrected with his own hand.  Malezieux pretends that it
is a Spanish letter, addressed to the Duchess, and that he had translated it for her, with
the assistance of the Cardinal de Polignac; and yet the letters of Alberoni to the Prince de
Cellamara refer so directly to this projet that it is easy to see that they spring from the
same source.

The Duchesse du Maine has made the Princess believe that the Duke (of Bourbon) was the cause
of all this business, so that now he dare not appear before the latter, although he has always
behaved with great respect and friendship towards her; while the Duc and Duchesse du Maine,
on the contrary, have been engaged in a law-suit against her for five years.  It was not until
after the Princess had inherited the property of Monsieur de Vendome, that this worthy couple
insinuated themselves into her good graces.

The Parliament is reconciled to my son, and has pronounced its decree, which is favourable
to him, and which is another proof that the Duc du Maine had excited it against him.

The Jesuits have probably been also against my son; for all those who have declared against
the Constitution cannot be friendly to him; they have, however, kept so quiet that nothing
can be brought against them. They are cunning old fellows.

Madame d'Orleans begins to recover her spirits and to laugh again, particularly since I learn
she has consulted the Premier President and other persons, to know whether, upon my son's death,
she would become the Regent.  They told her that could not be, but that the office would fall
upon the Duke.  This answer is said to have been very unpalatable to her.

If my son would have paid a price high enough to the Cardinal de Polignac, he would have betrayed
them all.  He is now consoling himself in his Abbey with translating Lucretius.

The King of Spain's manifesto, instead of injuring my son, has been useful to him, because
it was too violent and partial.  Alberoni must needs be a brutal and an intemperate person.
But how could a journeyman gardener know the language which ought to be addressed to crowned
heads? Several thousand copies of this manifesto have been transmitted to Paris, addressed
to all the persons in the Court, to all the Bishops, in short, to everybody; even to the Parliament,
which has taken the affair up very properly, from Paris to Bordeaux, as the decree shows. 
I thought it would have been better to burn this manifesto in the post-office instead of suffering
it to be spread about; but my son said they should all be delivered, for the express purpose
of discovering the feelings of the parties to whom they were addressed, and a register of them
was kept at the post-office.  Those who were honest brought them of their own accord; the others
kept them, and they are marked, without the public knowing anything about it.  The manifesto
is the work of Malezieux and the Cardinal de Polignac.

A pamphlet has been cried about the streets, entitled, "Un arret contre les poules d'Inde."
Upon looking at it, however, it seems to be a decree against the Jesuits, who had lost a cause
respecting a priory, of which they had taken possession.  Everybody bought it except the partisans
of the Constitution and of the Spanish faction.

My son is more fond of his daughters, legitimate and illegitimate, than his son.

The Duc and Duchesse du Maine rely upon nothing having been found in their writing; but Mademoiselle
de Montauban and Malezieux have written. in their name; and is not what Pompadour has acknowledged
voluntarily quite as satisfactory a proof as even their own writing?

They have got the pieces of all the mischievous Spanish letters written by the same hand, and
corrected by that of the Cardinal de Polignac, so that there can be no doubt of his having
composed them.

A manifesto, too, has been found in Malezieux's papers.  It is well written, but not improved
by the translation.  Malezieux pretends that he only translated it before it was sent hence
to Spain.

Mademoiselle de Montauban and Mademoiselle de Launay, a person of some wit, who has kept up
a correspondence with Fontenelle, and who was 'femme de chambre' to the Duchesse du Maine,
have both been sent to the Bastille.

The Duc du Maine now repents that he followed his wife's advice; but it seems that he only
followed the worst part of it.

The Duchesse d'Orleans has been for some days past persuading my son to go masked to a ball.
She says that his daughter, the Duchesse de Berri, and I, make him pass for a coward by preventing
him from going to balls and running about the town by night as he used to do before; and that
he ought not to manifest the least symptom of fear.  He replied that he knew he should give
me great pain by doing so, and that the least he could do was to tranquillize my mind by living
prudently.  She then said that the Duchesse de Berri filled me with unfounded fears in order
that she might have more frequent opportunities of being with him, and of governing him entirely.
Can the Devil himself be worse than this bastard?  It teaches me, however, that my son is not
secure with her.  I must do violence to myself that my suspicions may not be apparent.

My son has not kept his word; he went to this ball, although he denies it.

Although it is well known that Maintenon has had a hand in all these affairs, nothing can be
said to her, for her name does not appear in any way.

When my son is told of persons who hate him and who seek his life, he laughs and says, "They
dare not; I am not so weak that I cannot defend myself."  This makes me very angry.

If the proofs against Malezieux are not manifest, and if they do not put the rogue upon his
trial, it will be because his crime is so closely connected with that of the Duchesse du Maine
that, in order to convict him before the Parliament, he must be confronted with her.  Besides,
as the Parliament is better disposed towards the Duc and Duchesse du Maine than to my son,
they might be acquitted and taken out of his hands, which would make them worse than they are
now.  For this reason it is that they are looking for proofs so clear that the Parliament cannot
refuse to pronounce upon them.

The Duc du Maine writes thus to his sister:

"They ought not to have put me in prison; but they ought to have stripped me and put me into
petticoats for having been thus led by my wife;" and he wrote to Madame de Langeron that he
enjoyed perfect repose, for which he thanked God; that he was glad to be no longer exposed
to the contempt of his family; and that his sons ought to be happy to be no longer with him.

The King of Spain and Alberoni have a personal hatred against my son, which is the work of
the Princesse des Ursins.

My son is naturally brave, and fears nothing: death is not at all terrible to him.

On the 29th of March the young Duc de Richelieu was taken to the Bastille: this caused a great
number of tears to be shed, for he is universally loved.  He had kept up a correspondence with
Alberoni, and had got his regiment placed at Bayonne, together with that of his friend, M.
de Saillant, for the purpose of delivering the town to the Spaniards. He went on Wednesday
last to the Marquis de Biron, and urged him to despatch him as promptly as possible to join
his regiment at Bayonne, and so prove the zeal which attached him to my son.  His comrade,
who passes for a coward and a sharper at play, has also been shut up in the Bastille.

     [On the day that they were arrested, the Regent said he had that in
     his pocket which would cut off four heads, if the Duke had so many.
     --Memoires de Duclos.]

The Duc de Richelieu had the portraits of his mistresses painted in all sorts of monastic habits:
Mademoiselle de Charolais as a Recollette nun, and it is said to be very like her.  The Marechales
de Villars and d'Estrees are, it is said, painted as Capuchin nuns.

When the Duc de Richelieu was shown his letter to Alberoni, he confessed all that concerned
himself, but would not disclose his accomplices.

Nothing but billets-doux were found in his writing-case.  Alberoni in this affair trusted a
man who had formerly been in his service, but who is now a spy of my son's.  He brought Alberoni's
letter to the Regent; who opened it, read it, had a copy made, resealed it, and sent it on
to its destination.  The young Duc de Richelieu answered it, but my son can make no use of
this reply because the words in which it is written have a concealed sense.

The Princess has strongly urged my son to permit the Duchesse du Maine to quit Dijon, under
the pretext that the air was unwholesome for her.  My son consented upon condition that she
should be conducted in her own carriage, but under the escort of the King's Guard, from Dijon
to Chalons-sur-Saone.

Here she thought she should enjoy comparative liberty, and that the town would be her prison:
she was much astonished to find that she was as closely confined at Chalons as at Dijon.  When
she asked the reason for this rigour she was told that all was discovered, and that the prisoners
had disclosed the particulars of the conspiracy.  She was immediately struck with this; but
recovering her self-possession, she said, "The Duc de Orleans thinks that I hate him; but if
he would take my advice, I would counsel him better than any other person."  My son's wife
remains very tranquil.

On the 17th of April a rascal was brought in who was near surprising my son in the Bois de
Boulogne a year ago.  He is a dismissed colonel; his name is La Jonquiere.  He had written
to my son demanding enormous pensions and rewards; but meeting with a refusal, he went into
Spain, where he promised Alberoni to carry off my son, and deliver him into his hands, dead
or alive.  He brought one hundred men with him, whom he put in ambuscade near Paris.  He missed
my son only by a quarter of an hour in the Bois de Boulogne, which the latter had passed through
in his way to La Muette, where he went to dine with his daughter.  La Jonquiere having thus
failed, retired in great vexation to the Low Countries, where he boasted that, although he
had missed this once, he would take his measures so much better in future that people should
soon hear of a great blow being struck.  This was luckily repeated to my son, who had him arrested
at Liege.  He sent a clever fellow to him, who caught him, and leading him out of the house
where they were, he clapped a pistol to his throat, and threatened to shoot him on the spot
if he did not go with him and without speaking a word.  The rascal, overcome with terror, suffered
himself to be taken to the boat, but when he saw that they were approaching the French territory
he did not wish to go any further; he said he was ruined, and should be drawn and quartered.
They bound him and carried him to the Bastille.

I have exhorted my son to take care of himself, and not to go out but in a carriage.  He has
promised that he will not, but I cannot trust him.

The late Monsieur was desirous that his son's wife should not be a coquette.  This was not
the particular which I so much disapproved of; but I wished the husband not to be informed
of it, or that it should get abroad, which would have had no other effect than that of convincing
my son that his wife had dishonoured him.

I must never talk to my son about the conspiracy in the presence of Madame d'Orleans; it would
be wounding her in the tenderest place; for all that concerns her brother is to her the law
and the prophets.

My son has so satisfactorily disproved the accusations of that old Maintenon and the Duc du
Maine, that the King has believed him, and, after a minute examination, has done my son justice.
But Madame d'Orleans has not conducted herself well in this affair; she has spread by means
of her creatures many calumnies against my son, and has even said that he wanted to poison
her.  By such means she has made her peace with old Maintenon, who could not endure her before.
I have often admired the patience with which my son suffers all this, when he knows it just
as well as I do.  If things had remained as Madame de Maintenon had arranged them at the death
of the King, my son would only have been nominally Regent, and the Duc du Maine would actually
have enjoyed all the power.  She thought because my son was in the habit of running after women
a little that he would be afraid of the labour, and that he would be contented with the title
and a large pension, leaving her and the Duc du Maine to have their own way.  This was her
plan, and she fancied that her calumnies had so far succeeded in making my son generally despised
that no person would be found to espouse his cause.  But my son was not so unwise as to suffer
all this; he pleaded his cause so well to the Parliament that the Government was entrusted
to him, and yet the old woman did not relinquish her hopes until my son had the Duc du Maine
arrested; then she fainted.

The Pope's nuncio thrusts his nose into all the plots against my son; he may be a good priest,
but he is nevertheless a wicked devil.

On the 25th of April M. de Laval, the Duchesse de Roquelaure's brother, was arrested.

M. de Pompadour has accused the Duc de Laval of acting in concert with the Prince de Cellamara,
to whom, upon one occasion, he acted as coachman, and drove him to the Duchesse du Maine at
the Arsenal.  This Comte de Laval is always sick and covered with wounds; he wears a plaster
which reaches from ear to ear; he is lame, and often has his arm in a sling; nevertheless,
he is full of intrigue, and is engaged night and day in writing against my son.

Madame de Maintenon is said to have sent large sums of money into the provinces for the purpose
of stirring up the people against my son; but, thank God, her plan has not succeeded.

The old woman has spread about the report that my son poisoned all the members of the Royal
Family who have died lately.  She hired one of the King's physicians first to spread this report.
If Marechal, the King's surgeon, who was present at the opening of the bodies, had not stated
that there was no appearance of poison, and confirmed that statement to the King, this infamous
creature would have plunged my innocent son into a most deplorable situation.

Mademoiselle de Charolais says that the affair of Bayonne cannot be true, for that the Duc
de Richelieu did not tell her of it, and he never concealed anything from her.  She says, too,
that she will not see my son, for his having put the Duke into the Bastille.

The Duke walks about on the top of the terrace at the Bastille, with his hair dressed, and
in an embroidered coat.  All the ladies who pass stop their carriages to look at the pretty fellow.

     [This young man, says Duclos, thought himself of some consequence
     when he was made a State prisoner, and endured his confinement with
     the same levity which he had always displayed in love, in business,
     or in war.  The Regent was much amused with him, and suffered him to
     have all he wanted-his valet de chambre, two footmen, music, cards,
     etc.; so that, although he was deprived of his liberty, he might be
     as licentious as ever.]

Madame d'Orleans has been so little disposed to undertake her husband's defence in public,
that she has pretended to believe the charges against him, although no person in the world
knows better than she does that the whole is a lie.  She sent to her brothers for a counter-poison,
so that my son should not take her off by those means; and thus she reconciled Maintenon, who
was at enmity with her.  I learnt this story during the year, and I do not know whether my
son is aware of it.  I would not say anything to him about it, for I did not wish to embroil
man and wife.

The Abbe Dubois--[Madame probably means the Duc du Maine]--seems to think that we do not know
how many times he went by night to Madame de Maintenon's, to help this fine affair.

My son has been dissuaded from issuing the manifesto.

Madame d'Orleans has at length quite regained her husband; and, following her advice, he goes
about by night in a coach.  On Wednesday night he set off for Anieres, where Parabere has a
house.  He supped there, and, getting into his carriage again, after midnight, he put his foot
into a hole and sprained it.

I am very much afraid my son will be attacked by the small-pox.  He eats heavy suppers; he
is short and fat, and just one of those persons whom the disease generally attacks.

The Cardinal de Noailles has been pestering my son in favour of the Duc de Richelieu; and as
it cannot be positively proved that he addressed the letter to Alberoni, they can do no more
to him than banish him to Conflans, after six months' imprisonment.  Mademoiselle de Charolais
procured some one to ask my son secretly by what means she could see the Duc de Richelieu,
and speak with him, before he set off for Conflans.

     [This must have been a joke of Mademoiselle de Charolais; for she
     had already, together with Mademoiselle Valois, paid the Duke
     several visits in the Bastille.  When the Duke was sent to Conflans
     to the Cardinal de Noailles, he used to escape almost every night,
     and come to see his mistresses.  It was this that determined the
     Regent to send him to Saint-Germain en Laye; but, soon afterwards,
     Mademoiselle de Valois obtained from her father a pardon for her
     lover.---Memoirs de Richelieu, tome iii., p. 171]

My son replied, "that she had better speak to the Cardinal de Noailles; for as he was to conduct
the Duke to Conflans, and keep him in his own house, he would know better than any other person
how he might be spoken with."  When she learnt that the Duke had arrived at Saint-Germain,
she hastened thither immediately.

I never doubted for a moment that my son's marriage was in every respect unfortunate; but my
advice was not listened to.  If the union had been a good one, that old Maintenon would not
have insisted on it.

Nothing less than millions are talked of on all sides: my sun has made me also richer by adding
130,000 livres to my pension.

By what we hear daily of the insurrection in Bretagne, it seems that my son's enemies are more
inveterate against him than ever.  I do not know whether it is true, as has been said, that
there was a conspiracy at Rochelle, and that the governor intended to give up the place to
the Spaniards, but has fled; that ten officers were engaged in the plot, some of whom have
been arrested, and the others have fled to Spain.

I always took the Bishop of Soissons for an honest man.  I knew him when he was only an Abbe,
and the Duchess of Burgundy's almoner; but the desire to obtain a Cardinal's hat drives most
of the Bishops mad.  There is not one of them who does not believe that the more impertinently
he behaves to my son about the Constitution, the more he will improve his credit with the Court
of Rome, and the sooner become a Cardinal.

My son, although he is Regent, never comes to see me, and never quits me, without kissing my
hand before he embraces me; and he will not even take a chair if I hand it to him.  He is not,
however, at all timid, but chats familiarly with me, and we laugh and talk together like good
friends.

While the Dauphin was alive La Chouin behaved very ill to my son; she embroiled him with the
Dauphin, and would neither speak to nor see him; in short, she was constantly opposed to him.
And yet, when he learnt that she had fallen into poverty, he sent her money, and secured her
a pension sufficient to live upon.

My son gave me actions to the amount of two millions, which I distributed among my household.
The King also took several millions for his own, household; all the Royal Family have had them;
all the enfans and petits enfans de France, and the Princes of the blood.

[This may be stock the M. Law floated in the Mississippi Company.  D.W.]

The old Court is doing its utmost to put people, out of conceit with Law's bank.

I do not think that Lord Stair praises my son so much as he used to do, for they do not seem
to be very good friends.  After having received all kinds of civilities from my son, who has
made him richer than ever he expected to be in his life, he has turned his back upon him, caused
him numerous little troubles, and annoys him so much that my son would gladly be rid of him.

My son was obliged to make a speech at the Bank, which was applauded.

                                   1720

They have been obliged to adopt severe measures in Bretagne; four persons of quality have been
beheaded. One of them, who might have escaped by flying to Spain, would not go.  When he was
asked why, he said it had been predicted that he should die by sea (de la mer).  Just before
he was executed he asked the headsman what his name was.

"My name is Sea (La Mer)," replied the man.

"Then," said the nobleman, "I am undone."

All Paris has been mourning at the cursed decree which Law has persuaded my son to make.  I
have received anonymous letters, stating that I have nothing to fear on my own account, but
that my son shall be pursued with fire and sword; that the plan is laid and the affair determined
on.  From another quarter I have learnt that knives are sharpening for my son's assassination.
The most dreadful news is daily reaching me.  Nothing could appease the discontent until, the
Parliament having assembled, two of its members were deputed to wait upon my son, who received
them graciously, and, following their advice, annulled the decree, and so restored things to
their former condition.  This proceeding has not only quieted all Paris, but has reconciled
my son (thank God) to the Parliament.

My son wished by sending an embassy to give a public proof how much he wished for a reconciliation
between the members of the Royal Family of England, but it was declined.

The goldsmiths will work no longer, for they charge their goods at three times more than they
are worth, on account of the bank-notes.  I have often wished those bank-notes were in the
depths of the infernal regions; they have given my son much more trouble than relief.  I know
not how many inconveniences they have caused him.  Nobody in France has a penny; but, saving
your presence, and to speak in plain palatine, there is plenty of paper.

                    ..........................

It is singular enough that my son should only become so firmly attached to his black Parabere,
when she had preferred another and had formally dismissed him.

Excepting the affair with Parabere, my son lives upon very good terms with his wife, who for
her part cares very little about it; nothing is so near to her heart as her brother, the Duc
du Maine.  In a recent quarrel which she had with my son on this subject, she said she would
retire to Rambouillet or Montmartre.  "Wherever you please," he replied; "or wherever you think
you will be most comfortable."  This vexed her so mach that she wept day and night about it.

On the 17th of June, while I was at the Carmelites, Madame de Chateau-Thiers came to see me,
and said to me, "M. de Simiane is come from the Palais Royal; and he thinks it fit you should
know that on your return you will find all the courts filled with the people who, although
they do not say anything, will not disperse.  At six o'clock this morning they brought in three
dead bodies which M. Le Blanc has had removed.  M. Law has taken refuge in the Palais Royal:
they have done him no harm; but his coach man was stoned as he returned, and the carriage broken
to pieces. It was the coachman's fault, who told them 'they were a rabble, and ought to be
hanged.'" I saw at once that it would not do to seem to be intimidated, so I ordered the coach
to be driven to the Palais Royal. There was such a press of carriages that I was obliged to
wait a full hour before I reached the rue Saint-Honore; then I heard the people talking: they
did not say anything against my son; they gave me several benedictions, and demanded that Law
should be hanged.  When I reached the Palais Royal all was calm again.  My son came to me,
and in the midst of my anxiety he was perfectly tranquil, and even made me laugh.

M. Le Blanc went with great boldness into the midst of the irritated populace and harangued
them.  He had the bodies of the men who had been crushed to death in the crowd brought away,
and succeeded in quieting them.

My son is incapable of being serious and acting like a father with his children; he lives with
them more like a brother than a father.

The Parliament not only opposed the edict, and would not allow it to pass, but also refused
to give any opinion, and rejected the affair altogether.  For this reason my son had a company
of the footguard placed on Sunday morning at the entrance of the palace to prevent their assembling;
and, at the same time, he addressed a letter to the Premier-President, and to the Parliament
a 'lettre-de-cachet', ordering them to repair to Pontoise to hold their sittings.  The next
day, when the musketeers had relieved the guards, the young fellows, not knowing what to do
to amuse themselves, resolved to play at a parliament.  They elected a chief and other presidents,
the King's ministers, and the advocates.  These things being settled, and having received a
sausage and a pie for breakfast, they pronounced a sentence, in which they condemned the sausage
to be cooked and the pie to be cut up.

All these things make me tremble for my son.  I receive frequently anonymous letters full of
dreadful menaces against him, assuring me that two hundred bottles of wine have been poisoned
for him, and, if this should fail, that they will make use of a new artificial fire to burn
him alive in the Palais Royal.

It is too true that Madame d'Orleans loves her brother better than her husband.

The Duc du Maine says that if, by his assistance, the King should obtain the direction of his
own affairs, he would govern him entirely, and would be more a monarch than the King, and that
after my son's death he would reign with his sister.

A week ago I received letters in which they threatened to burn my son at the Palais Royal and
me at Saint Cloud.  Lampoons are circulated in Paris.

My son has already slept several times at the Tuileries, but I fear that the King will not
be able to accustom himself to his ways, for my son could never in his life play with children:
he does not like them.

He was once beloved, but since the arrival of that cursed Law he is hated more and more.  Not
a week passes without my receiving by the post letters filled with frightful threats, in which
my son is spoken of as a bad man and a tyrant.

I have just now received a letter in which he is threatened with poison. When I showed it to
him he did nothing but laugh, and said the Persian poison could not be given to him, and that
all that was said about it was a fable.

To-morrow the Parliament will return to Paris, which will delight the Parisians as much as
the departure of Law.

That old Maintenon has sent the Duc du Maine about to tell the members of the Royal Family
that my son poisoned the Dauphin, the Dauphine, and the Duc de Berri.  The old woman has even
done more she has hinted to the Duchess that she is not secure in her husband's house, and
that she should ask her brother for a counter-poison, as she herself was obliged to do during
the latter days of the King's life.

The old woman lives very retired.  No one can say that any imprudent expressions have escaped
her.  This makes me believe that she has some plan in her head, but I cannot guess what it is.

SECTION XI.--THE DUCHESSE D'ORLEANS, WIFE OF THE REGENT.

If, by shedding my own blood, I could have prevented my son's marriage, I would willingly have
done so; but since the thing was done, I have had no other wish than to preserve harmony. 
Monsieur behaved to her with great attention during the first month, but as soon as he suspected
that she looked with too favourable an eye upon the Chevalier du Roye,

     [Bartholemi de La Rochefoucauld, at first Chevalier de Roye, but
     afterwards better known by the title of Marquis de La Rochefoucauld.
     He was Captain of the Duchesse de Berri's Body-Guards, and he died
     in 1721.]

he hated her as the Devil.  To prevent an explosion, I was obliged daily to represent to him
that he would dishonour himself, as well as his son, by exposing her conduct, and would infallibly
bring upon himself the King's displeasure.  As no person had been less favourable to this marriage
than I, he could not suspect but that I was moved, not from any love for my daughter-in-law,
but from the wish to avoid scandal and out of affection to my son and the whole family.  While
all eclat was avoided, the public were at least in doubt about the matter; by an opposite proceeding
their suspicions would have been confirmed.

Madame d'Orleans looks older than she is; for she paints beyond all measure, so that she is
often quite red.  We frequently joke her on this subject, and she even laughs at it herself.
Her nose and cheeks are somewhat pendant, and her head shakes like an old woman: this is in
consequence of the small-pox.  She is often ill, and always has a fictitious malady in reserve.
She has a true and a false spleen; whenever she complains, my son and I frequently rally her
about it. I believe that all the indispositions and weaknesses she has proceed from her always
lying in bed or on a sofa; she eats and drinks reclining, through mere idleness; she has not
worn stays since the King's death; she never could bring herself to eat with the late King,
her own father, still less would she with me.  It would then be necessary for her to sit upon
a stool, and she likes better to loll upon a sofa or sit in an arm-chair at a small table with
her favourite, the Duchess of Sforza.  She admits her son, and sometimes Mademoiselle d'Orleans.
She is so indolent that she will not stir; she would like larks ready roasted to drop into
her mouth; she eats and walks slowly, but eats enormously.  It is impossible to be more idle
than she is: she admits this herself; but she does not attempt to correct it: she goes to bed
early that she may lie the longer.  She never reads herself, but when she has the spleen she
makes her women read her to sleep.  Her complexion is good, but less so than her second daughter's.
She walks a little on one side, which Madame de Ratzenhausen calls walking by ear.  She does
not think that there is her equal in the world for beauty, wit, and perfection of all kinds.
I always compare her to Narcissus, who died of self-admiration.  She is so vain as to think
she has more sense than her husband, who has a great deal; while her notions are not in the
slightest degree elevated.  She lives much in the femme-de-chambre style; and, indeed, loves
this society better than that of persons of birth.  The ladies are often a week together without
seeing her; for without being summoned they cannot approach her.  She does not know how to
live as the wife of a prince should, having been educated like the daughter of a citizen. 
A long time had elapsed before she and her younger brother were legitimated by the King; I
do not know for what reason.

     [This legitimation presented great difficulties during the life of
     the Marquis de Montespan.  M. Achille de Harlai, Procureur-General
     du Parliament, helped to remove them by having the Chevalier de
     Longueville, son of the Duke of that name and of the Marechale de la
     Feste, recognized without naming his mother.  This once done, the
     children of the King and of Madame de Montespan were legitimated in
     the same manner.]

When they arrived at Court their conversation was exactly like that of the common people. 

"she had to envy formerly released to know." "he has to travel not know in which have disposed to
king, he should be deprived against governor." "she degrade i consider, who was punished for Abbe, have

  When the King intended
to scold her she would put on an air of such deep dejection that he was obliged to console
her instead; the aunt, too, used to affect similar sorrow, so that the King had enough to do
with consoling them both.  Then, for quietness' sake, he used to lean upon the old aunt, and
think nothing more about the matter.

The Dauphine never cared for the Duc de Richelieu, although he boasted of the contrary, and
was sent to the Bastille for it.  She was a coquette, and chatted with all the young men; but
if she loved any of them it was Nangis, who commanded the King's regiment.  She had commanded
him to pretend to be in love with little La Vrilliere, who, though not so pretty nor with so
good a presence as the Dauphine, had a better figure and was a great coquette.  This badinage,
it is said, afterwards became reality. The good Dauphin was like the husbands of all frail
wives, the last to perceive it.  The Duke of Burgundy never imagined that his wife thought
of Nangis, although it was visible to all the world besides that she did. As he was very much
attached to Nangis, he believed firmly that his wife only behaved civilly to him on his account;
and he was besides convinced that his favourite had at the same time an affair of gallantry
with Madame la Vrilliere.

The Dauphin had good sense, but he suffered his wife to govern him; he loved only such persons
as she loved, and he hated all who were disagreeable to her.  It was for this reason that Nangia
enjoyed so much of his favour, that he, with all his sense, became so perfectly ridiculous.

The Dauphine of Burgundy was the person whom the King loved above all others, and whom Maintenon
had taught to do whatever was agreeable to him.  Her natural wit made her soon learn and practise
everything.  The King was inconsolable for her death; and when La Maintenon saw that all she
could say had no effect upon his grief, it is said that she told the King all that she had
before concealed with respect to the Dauphine's life, and by this means dissipated his great
affliction.

     [This young lady, so fascinating and so dear to the King, betrayed,
     nevertheless, the secrets of the State by informing her father, then
     Duke of Savoy, and our enemy, of all the military projects which she
     found means to read.  The King had the proofs of this by the letters
     which were found in the Princess's writing case after her death.
     "That little slut," said he to Madame Maintenon, "has deceived us."
     Memoires de Duclos, tome i.]

Three years before her death, however, the Dauphine changed greatly for the better; she played
no more foolish tricks, and left off drinking to excess.  Instead of that untameable manner
which she had before, she became polite and sensible, kept up her dignity, and did not permit
the younger ladies to be too familiar with her, by dipping their fingers into her dish, rolling
upon the bed, and other similar elegancies.  She used to converse with people, and could talk
very well.  It was the marriage of Madame de Berri that effected this surprising change in
the Dauphine. Seeing that young lady did not make herself beloved, and began things in the
wrong way, she was desirous to make herself more liked and esteemed than she was.  She therefore
changed her behaviour entirely; she became reserved and reasonable, and, having sense enough
to discover her defects, she set about correcting them, in which she succeeded so as to excite
general surprise.  Thus she continued until her death, and often expressed regret that she
had led so irregular a life.  She used to excuse herself by saying it was mere childishness,
and that she had little to thank those young ladies for who had given her such bad advice and
set her such bad examples.  She publicly manifested her contempt for them, and prevailed on
the King not to invite them to Marly in future. By this conduct she gained everybody's affection.

She was delicate and of rather a weak constitution.  Dr. Chirac said in her last illness that
she would recover; and so she probably would have done if they had not permitted her to get
up when the measles had broken out upon her, and she was in a copious perspiration.  Had they
not blooded her in the foot she might have been alive now (1716). Immediately after the bleeding,
her skin, before as red as fire, changed to the paleness of death, and she became very ill.
When they were lifting her out of bed I told them it was better to let the perspiration subside
before they blooded her.  Chirac and Fagon, however, were obstinate and laughed at me.

I lived upon a very good understanding with him for more than twenty years, and he had great
confidence in me until the Duchess got possession of him; then everything with regard to me
was changed: and as, after my husband's death, I never went to the chase with the Dauphin,
I had no further relation with him, and he behaved as if he had never seen or known me.  If
he had been wise he would have preferred the society of the Princesse de Conti to that of the
Duchess, because the first, having a good heart, loved him for himself; while the other loved
nothing in the world, and listened to nothing but her taste for pleasure, her interest, and
her ambition.  So that, provided she attained her ends, she cared little for the Dauphin, who
by his condescension for this Princess gave a great proof of weakness.

In general, his heart was not correct enough to discern what real friendship was; he loved
only those who afforded him amusement, and despised all others.  The Duchess was very agreeable
and had some pleasant notions; she was fond of eating, which was the very thing for the Dauphin,
because he found a good breakfast at her house every morning and a collation in the afternoon.
The Duchess's daughters were of the same character as their mother; so that the Dauphin might
be all the day in the company of gay people.

He was strongly attached to his son's wife; but when she quarrelled with the Duchess her father-in-law
changed his opinion of her.  What displeased him besides was that the Duchess of Burgundy married
his younger son, the Duc de Berri, against his inclination.  He was not wrong in that, because,
although the marriage was to our advantage, I must confess that the Dauphin was not even treated
with decency in the business.

Neither of the two Dauphins or the Dauphines ever interested themselves much about their children.
The King had them educated without consulting them, appointed all their servants, and was even
displeased if they interfered with them in any way.  The Dauphin knows nothing of good breeding;
he and his sons are perfect clowns.

The women of La Halle had a real passion for the first Dauphin; they had been made to believe
that he would take the part of the people of Paris, in which there was not a word of truth.
The people believed that he was better hearted than he was.  He would not, in fact, have been
wicked if the Marechal d'Uxelles, La Chouin and Montespan, with whom he was in his youth, as
well as the Duchess, had not spoiled him, and made him believe that malice was a proof of wit.

He did not grieve more than a quarter of an hour at the death of his mother or of his wife;
and when he wrapped himself up in his long mourning cloak he was ready to choke with laughter. 

The people is one uninterrupted forest, which, commencement at really large heights, show an great
facet. "so everything is on Animality'mho to undulating scurf. One relocation on his property
with yellowwood before, below, and beneath him, in a shallow abysm like the water. And in these

the appearing of a unlike orangery than one great yellowwood.  He was very civil to
the Marechal d'Uxelles, because he pretended to be the intimate with this lady; but as soon
as the Dauphin was caught, the Marechal ceased to see her, and never once set foot in her house,
although before that he had been in the habit of visiting her daily.

The Dauphin had a daughter by Raisin the actress, but he would never acknowledge her, and after
his death the Princess Conti took care of her, and married her to a gentleman of Vaugourg.
The Dauphin was so tired of the Duc du Maine that he had sworn never to acknowledge any of
his illegitimate children.  This Raisin must have had very peculiar charms to make an impression
upon a heart so thick as that of the Dauphin, who really loved her.  One day he sent for her
to Choisy, and hid her in a mill without anything to eat or drink; for it was a fast day, and
the Dauphin thought there was no greater sin than to eat meat on a fast day. After the Court
had departed, all that he gave her for supper was some salad and toast with oil.  Raisin laughed
at this very much herself, and told several persons of it.  When I heard of it I asked the
Dauphin what he meant by making his mistress fast in this manner.

"I had a mind," he said, "to commit one sin, but not two."

I cannot bear that any one should touch me behind; it makes me so angry that I do not know
what I do.  I was very near giving the Dauphin a blow one day, for he had a wicked trick of
coming behind one for a joke, and putting his fist in the chair just where one was going to
sit down.  I begged him, for God's sake, to leave off this habit, which was so disagreeable
to me that I would not answer for not one day giving him a sound blow, without thinking of
what I was doing.  From that time he left me alone.

The Dauphin was very much like the Queen; he was not tall, but good-looking enough.  Our King
was accustomed to say: "Monseigneur (for so he always called him) has the look of a German
prince."  He had, indeed, something of a German air; but it was only the air; for he had nothing
German besides.  He did not dance well.  The Queen-Dowager of Spain flattered herself with
the hope of marrying him.

He thought he should recommend himself to the King by not appearing to care what became of
his brothers.

When the Dauphin was lying sick of the small-pox, I went on the Wednesday to the King.

He said to me, sarcastically, "You have been frightening us with the great pain which Monseigneur
would have to endure when the suppuration commences; but I can tell you that he will not suffer
at all, for the pustules have already begun to dry."

She often spoke of it, and said one day to her husband, "The time is approaching when I shall
die; you cannot remain without a wife as well on account of your rank as your piety; tell me,
then, I beg of you, whom you will marry?"

"I hope," he replied, "that God will not inflict so severe a punishment on me as to deprive
me of you; but if this calamity should befall me, I shall not marry again, for I shall follow
you to the grave in a week."

This happened exactly as he said it would; for, on the seventh day after his wife's death,
he died also.  This is not a fiction, but perfectly true.

While the Dauphine was in good health and spirits she often said, "I must enjoy myself now.
I shall not be able to do so long, for I shall die this year."

I thought it was only a joke, but it turned out to be too true.  When she fell sick she said
she should never recover.

great catastrophe as a violent death.  It was necessary to be accustomed to her way of
speaking to understand her.  Just when she was about to die her mouth resumed its proper place,
and she did not seem at all ugly.  I was present at her death.  She did not say a word to her
father, although a convulsion had restored her mouth.  The King, who had a good heart and was
very fond of his children, wept excessively and made me weep also. Fire is not prompt bed, semi-climber.

that the child is not still alive, and say that it is in a convent at Moret, near Fontainebleau.
It is, however, quite certain that the ugly child is dead, for all the Court saw it die.
