"See an' no' be mixin' them than," said Sandy, shovin' in another slide.  "This, as you'll
easily recognise, is Bailie Thingymabob."

The laddies gae the Bailie a roond o' applause, an' Bandy Wobster says, "Man, but he's awfu'
indistink, Sandy.  Ye can hardly mak' him oot."

"That's no' to be windered at," says Sandy.  "I never fell in wi' onybody that cud mak' him
oot.  Ye canna expeck a magic lantern to do what ye canna do yersel'.  It'll be a bad job for
the Bailie, I can tell you, when fowk begin to mak' him oot.  The next picture is Cooncillor
Spinaway."

"Ay, I'll go doon the yaird an' hae a reek," says Bandy, gettin up frae his seat, an' settin'
a' the loons a-lauchin'.

"Ye needna gae awa' i' the noo," says Dauvid.  "Wait till you see the rest o' the pictures."

"Dinna mistak' yersel'," says Bandy in laich, "when that cove's gotten on his feet he'll no'
sit doon for half an 'oor.  I never saw him get up yet but he gae a'body mair than their sairin'
o' sooage, an' main-drains, an' gas-warks, an' so on afore he feenisht.  Wait till you see."

"Haud your haiverin' tongue," said Sandy.  "Bliss your heart, he's in the magic lantern.  He
canna speak there."

"I daursay you're richt," says Bandy, clawin' his heid.  "Weel, the Provost shud juist keep
a magic lantern handy, an' gar him bide in't. That wud keep him quiet at the meetin's."

"We'll lat ye see a picture o' the whole Toon Cooncil, noo," said Sandy; an' in cam' the picture.
"There's been some mair mixin' again," said Sandy, gey kankered like.  "That's shurely no'
the Toon Cooncil. What's number echteen, Nathan?"

"The pleg o' locusts in Egypt," says Nathan.

"Hoo's that gotten in there, ava?" says Sandy.

"O, they'd juist putten't amon' the ither plegs," brook in Bandy Wobster.

"Here's a very interestin' slide," says Sandy, as he put in the next picture.  "This is a picture
o' the deputation that waited on some o' the members o' the Toon Cooncil at lest election an'
priggit wi' them to bide in, altho' they were awfu' anxious to hae dune wi't."

"That's like a picture o' a bunghole withoot a barrel roond it," said ane o' Dauvid's laddies.

"There's naebody there, Sandy," said Bandy Wobster.

"Ay, but that's the deputation tho'," said Sandy.  "They're mibby inveesible, but that's them
for a' that.  The name's on the picture. You can look yersel', if you dinna believe me."

"Ay, Pepper's Ghost!" roars oot the Smith.  "He waits on lots o' fowk aboot election times.
He's juist a perfeck scunner, nominatin' fowk against their will, an' draggin' them into publicity
when they wud far raither be kickin' up some ither kind o' a row."

He's an awfu' haiverin' body the Smith sometimes.  When he's sensible, he's juist akinda ridic'lously
sensible; an' when he's' no', he's juist as far the ither wey.

"Deputations is aye anonimous," says Sandy.  "They aye turn up wi' a nomdy plum.  It's juist
the men's modesty that keeps them oot o' sicht. They pey a' their veesits throo the nicht,
an' fient a cratur kens eechie or ochie aboot them.  Man, I like modesty.  I've a great respeck
for a deputation that keeps oot o' sicht."

"C'wa wi' some mair pictures," roared some o' the laddies, an' Sandy's grand perrygrinashin
ended a' o' a sudden.

"The next picture is a very interestin' ane," said Sandy, efter he'd gotten a breath.  "This
is ane o' the famous meal mobs.  You see the crood o' men, sae, they're a' roarin' thegither.
There's neen o' you loons 'ill mind o' the meal mobs," said Sandy, "but I mind o' them fine.
A gey toon it was i' thae days.  You'll notice the auld Toon-Clark i' the middle there, wi'
his hands up, threatenin' to send for the pileece, an' a' the crood yalpin' at him like as
mony dogs.  I can tell you loons, ye may thank your stars that you wasna born when wey-o'-doin's
like that was carried on i' the toon.  You dinna ken naethin' aboot it.  There's been naethin'
like it i' the toon o' Arbroath sin'----"

"Hold on, Sandy," roared Nathan; "that's the wrang picture you have in again; here's the meal
mob here.  Look an' see what's on that ane."

"A Presbitree Meetin'!" read oot Sandy; an' you wudda thocht the Smith an' Bandy Wobster were
genna ding doon the hoose wi' their noise an' roarin' an' lauchin'.

"I thocht they were gey black-lookin' gentry for a meal mob," says the Smith; an' Bandy nodded
his heid an' leuch, an' says, "Man, Sandy's a perfeck genius as fac's ocht, I hinna heard onything
like him."

I hinna time to tell you aboot a' the rest o' the exhibition.  It was a treat in mair weys
than ane.  Sandy lut's see a lot o' notables like Mester Gladstone, an' Blind Hewie, an' Steeple
Jeck, an' the Prince o' Wales, an' Burke an' Hair, an' the Jook o' Argile, an' Dykin Elshinder.
But the crooner o' them a' cam' when Sandy says--"Noo, here's Snakimupo, the famous king o'
the Cannibal Islands, an' his favourite squaw, that eats missionaries, an' Bibles, an' poopits
whenever they can get a haud o' them"--an' in he shot--wha d'ye think?  Juist Sandy an' me
oorsels, life-size--ay, an' bigger!

"O, golly midgins!" says ane o' Dauvid's lassies, wi' her hands up, an' her moo an' her een
wide open.

You never heard sic a riffin' as there was, the laddies a' roarin' "The King o' the Cannibal
Islands," an' Sandy wirrin' like a perfeck terrier.

"That's some o' Robbie Boath's wark," he says in laich till himsel', wi' an awfu' girn on his
face.  "He gae me that picture special, an tell'd me the name o't, an' said to feenish wi't.
But gin he disna get a stane o' diseased pitatties frae me the morn that'll mak' him onweel
for a i'ortnicht, my name's no Si Bowden."  Syne he added heich oot, "Noo, loons and lassockies,
that's a'.  It's aboot time you was toddlin' awa' hame noo; an' I howp you've a' enjoyed it."

Dauvid proposed a vote o' thanks to Sandy; an' you wudda thocht a' the steam-engines atween
this an' Glesca had gotten into oor washin'-hoose, wi' their whistles on full-cock.  The noise
was something terriple.  I had to pet my fingers in my lugs, an' rin.

SANDY AND THE RHUBARB TART.

Was ever a woman so provokit wi' a ramstam, dotrifeed gomeral o' a man? Sandy Bowden 'ill hae
me i' my grave yet afore my time, as share's I'm a livin' woman.  There's no' a closed e'e
for me this nicht; an' there's Sandy awa' till his bed wi' his airms rowed up in bits o' an
auld yellow-cotton apron o' Mistress Mikaver's mither's.  Eh, sirce me; an' me was so happy
no' mony 'oors syne!

We gaed awa' to hae a cup o' tea wi' Mistress Mikaver--that's the scone-baker's widow, ye ken.
Her auldest laddie's been awa' oot amon' the Reed Indians, or some o' thae ither lang-haired,
naked fowk 'at never wash themsel's; an' they say he's made a heap o' bawbees.  He's a snod
bit stockie--a little beld, an' bowd-leggit, an' wants a thoom. But, I'll swag, the young kimmers
that were at the pairty didna see muckle wrang wi' him.  There was as keen competition for
him amon' the lassies as gin he'd been a gude-gaen public-hoose puttin' up for unction.

Me an' Sandy landed amon' the first o' the fowk.  A'thing was richt snod, I assure ye.  Mistress
Mikaver had the stair noo whitened, an' every stap was kaumed an' sandit, ye never saw the
like.  An' there she was hersel' wi' her best black goon on, no' a smad to be seen on't, an'
her lace kep an' beady apron.  She was a dandy, an' nae mistak'.
