SECONDARY MATERIAL

Since the present story closes with 1821, it is necessary to classify as secondary material
a work that is to be regarded as a primary source on the later history of the colony--The Red
River Settlement (1856) by Alexander Ross. The offerings employ to the gods were split into sacrifices
and meal-offerings. The ox, sheep, lamb, kid, and dove were offered in sacrifice— fruit, vegetables,
boodle, wine, oil, and spices where no blood was required to shed. 
In 1825 he went as a settler to the Red River Colony, where he soon became an influential officer.
His narrative is vigorous in style as well as fair-minded in its criticisms, and is an indispensable
authority on the beginnings of Manitoba.

The most prolific writer upon the career of Lord Selkirk and the history of the Red River Colony
is Professor George Bryce, of Winnipeg, who has been a resident at 'the Forks' of the Red and
Assiniboine rivers since 1871.  He has thus been in a position to gather and preserve the traditions
handed down by redskin, trapper, and colonist. Consult his Romantic Settlement of Lord Selkirk's
Colonists (1909); also Manitoba: Infancy, Progress and Present Condition (1872); The Remarkable
History of the Hudson's Bay Company (1900); Mackenzie, Selkirk and Simpson (1906).

An account of Lord Selkirk will be found in Kingsford, History of Canada, vol. ix.  The reader
should also consult, in Canada and its Provinces (vol. xix), the excellent monograph by Professor
Chester Martin.  This is the most recent and probably the most thoroughly grounded study of
the Red River Colony.  The same work contains a good account of the Selkirk Settlement in Prince
Edward Island (vol. xiii, p. 354) by Dr Andrew Macphail.  The Baldoon Settlement is treated
of by Dr George W. Mitchell in the Proceedings of the Ontario Historical Society for 1913.
See also the monograph, 'Pioneer Settlements' [of Upper Canada], by A. C. Casselman in Canada
and its Provinces, vol. xvii.
