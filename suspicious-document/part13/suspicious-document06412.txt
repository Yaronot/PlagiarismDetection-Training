"Hear me!" he continued; "you laugh again, Clifford--very good! Laugh on, but hear me. You
shall hear more of me in time to come. I fancy I shall be a fellow of considerable importance,
not in Texas simply, or in Mexico, but here--here in your own self-opinionated United States.
Suppose a few things, and go along with me while I speak them. That Texas must stretch to Mexico
I hold to be certain. A very few years will do that. It needs only thirty thousand more men
from our southern and southwestern States, and the brave old English tongue shall arouse the
best echoes in the city of  Montezuma! That done, and floods of people pour in from all  quarters.
It needs nothing but a feeling of security and peace--a conviction that property will be tolerably
safe, under a tolerably stable government--in other words, an Anglo-Saxon government--to tempt
millions of discontented emigrants from all quarters  of the world. Will this result have no
results of its own, think you? Will the immense resources of Mexico and Texas, represented,
as they then will be, by a stern, pressing,  performing people, have no effect upon these states
of yours?  They will have the greatest; nay, they will become essential to balance your own
federal weight, and keep you all in  equilibrio. For look you, the first hubbub with Great
Britain gives you Canada, at the expense of some of your coast-towns, a few millions of treasure,
and the loss of fifty thousand men. A bad exchange for the south; for Canada will make six
ponderous states, the policy and character of which will be New England all  over. To balance
this you will have your Florida territory, [Footnote: Florida, since admittied, but unhappily,
as a single state.] of which two feeble states may be made. Not enough for your purposes. But
the same war with England will render it necessary that your fleet should take possession of
Cuba; which, after a civil apology to Spain for taking such a liberty with her possessions,
and, perhaps, a few million by way of hush money, you carve into two more states, and, in this
manner, try to bolster up your federal relations. How many of her West India islands Great
Britain will be able to keep after such a war, is another problem, the solution of which will
depend upon the relative strength of fleets and success of  seamanship. These islands, which
should of right be ours, and  without which we can never be sure against any maritime power
so great and so arrogant as England, once conquered by our arms, find their natural, moral,
and social affinities in the southern states entirely; and, so far, contribute to strengthen
you in your congressional conflicts. But these are not enough, for the simple reason that the
population of states, purely agricultural, never makes that progress which is made in this
respect by a commercial and manufacturing people. With the command of the gulf, the possession
of an independent fleet by the Texans, the political characteristics of the states of Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, must undergo certain marked
changes, which can only be neutralized by the adoption, on the part of these states, of a new
policy corresponding with their change of interests. How far the cultivation of cotton by Texas
will lead to its abandonment in Carolina and Georgia, is a question which the next ten years
must solve. That they will be compelled to abandon it is  inevitable, unless they can succeed
in raising the article at six cents; a probability which no cotton-planter in either of these
states will be willing to contemplate now for an instant. Meanwhile, Texas is spreading herself
right and left. She conquers the Cumanches, subdues the native mongrel Mexicans. Her Hoestons
and Lamars are succeeded by other and abler men, under whose control the evils of government,
which followed the sway of such small animals as the Guerreros, and the Bolivars,  the Bustamentes,
and Sant' Annas, are very soon eradicated;  and the country, the noblest that God ever gave
to man in the hands of men, becomes a country!--a great and glorious country--stretching from
the gulf to the Pacific, and providing the natural balance, which, in a few years, the southern
state of this Union will inevitably need, by which alone your great confederacy will be kept
together. You see, therefore, why I speed to Texas. Should I not, with my philosophy, my horse
and my rifle--not to speak of stout heart and hand--reasonably aspire to the principality of
Sans Souci? Laugh, if you please, but be not irreverent. You shall have carte blanche then
if you will have a becoming faith now, on the word of a prince.  I say it, It is written--Sans
Souci." [Footnote: All these speculations  were written in 1840-'41. I need not remark upon
those which have since been verified.]

"Altissimo, excellentissimo, serenissimo!"

"Bravissimo, you improve; you will make a courtier--but mum now about my projects. We must
suppress our dignities here. We are at the entrance of our hell!"

We had reached the door of a low habitation in a secluded street. The house was of wood--an
ordinary hovel of two stories. A cluster of similar fabrics surrounded it, most of which I
afterward discovered--though this fact could not be  conjectured by an observer from the street--were
connected by blind alleys, inner courts, and chambers and passages running along the ground
floors. We stopped an instant, Kingsley having his hand upon the little iron knocker, a single
black ring, that worked against an ordinary iron knob.

"Before I knock," said he, in a whisper, "before I knock, Clifford, let me say that if you
have any reluctance--"

"None! none! knock!"

"You will meet with some dirty rascals, and you must not only meet them with seeming civility,
but as if you shared in their tastes--sought the same objects only--the getting of money--the
only object which alone is clearly comprehensible by their understanding."

"Go ahead! I will see you through."

"A word more! Get yourself in play at a different table from me. You will find rogues enough
around, ready to relieve you of your Mexicans. Leave me to my particular enemy; you will soon
see whose shield I touch--but keep an occasional eye upon us; and all that I ask farther at
your hands, should you see us by the ears, is to keep other fingers from taking hold of mine."

A heavy stroke of the knocker, followed by three light ones and a second heavy stroke, produced
us an answer from within.  The door unclosed, and by the light of a dim lamp, I discovered
before me, as a sort of warden, a little yellow, weather-beaten, skin-dried Frenchman, whom
I had frequently before seen at a fruit-shop in another part of the city. He looked at me,
however,  without any sign of recognition--with a blank, dull, indifferent countenance; motioned
us forward in silence, and reclosing the door, sunk into a chair immediately behind it. I followed
my companion through a passage which was unfathomably  dark, up a flight of stairs, which led
us into a sort of refreshment room. Tables were spread, with decanters, glasses, and tumblers
upon them, that appeared to be in continual use.  In a recess, stood that evil convenience
of most American  establishments, whether on land or sea, a liquor bar; its shelves crowded
with bottles, all of which seemed amply full, and ready to complete the overthrow of the victim,
which the other appliances of such a dwelling must already have actively begun.

"Here you may take in the Dutch courage, Clifford, should you lack the native. This, I know,
is not the case with you, and yet the novelty of one's situation frequently overcomes a sensitive
mind like fear. Perhaps a julep may be of use."

"None for me. I need no farther stimulant than the mere sense of mouvement. I take fire, like
a wheel, by my own progress."

"Pretty much the same case with myself. But I have been in the habit of drinking here, of late,
and too deeply. To-night, however, as I said before, ends all these habits. If there is honey
in the carcass, and strength from the sleep, there is wisdom from the folly, and virtue from
the vice. There is a moral as well as a physical recoil, that most certainly follows the  overcharge;
and really, speaking according to my sincere conviction I never felt myself to be a better
man, than just at this moment when I am about to do that which my own sense of morality fails
altogether to justify. I do not know that I make you understand my feelings; I scarcely understand
them myself; but of this sort they are, and I am really persuaded that I never felt in a better
disposition to be a good man and a working man than just at the close of a career which has
been equally profligate and idle."

I think my companion can be understood. There seems, in fact very little mystery in his moral
progress. I understood him, but did not answer. I was not anxious to keep up the ball of conversation
which he had begun with a spirit so mixed up of contradictions--so earnest yet so playful.
A deep sense of shame unquestionably lurked beneath his levity; and yet I make no question
that he felt in truth, and for the first time, that degree of mental hardihood of which he boasted.

 They were evidently "habitues del l'enfer"--men
to whom cards and dice were as absolutely necessary now, as brandy and tobacco to the drunkard.
These men were always at play. Even the smallest interval found them still shuffling the cards,
and looking up at every opening of the door, as if in hungering  anticipation of the prey.
At such periods alone might you behold any expression of anxiety in their faces. This disappeared
entirely the moment that they were in possession of the victim.  That imperturbable composure
which distinguished them was singularly contrasted with the fidgety eagerness and nervous rapidity
by which you could discover the latter; and I glanced over the operations of the two parties,
as they were fairly shown in several sets about the room, with a renewed feeling of wonder
how a man so truly clever and strong, in some things, as Kingsley, should allow himself to
be drawn so deeply into such low snares; the tricks of which seemed so apparent, and the attractions
of which, in the present instance, were obviously so inferior and low. I little knew by what
inoffensive and gradual changes the human mind, having once commenced its downward progress,
can hurry to the base; nor did I sufficiently allow for that love of hazard itself, in games
of chance, which I have already expressed the opinion, is natural to the proper heart of man,
belongs to a rational curiosity, and arises, most probably, from that highest property of his
intellect, namely, the love of art and intellectual ingenuity. It would be very important to
know this fact, since then, instead of the blind hostility which is entertained for sports
of this description, by certain classes of moralists among us, we might so employ their ministry
as to deprive them of their hurtfulness and make them permanently beneficial in the cause of
good education.

Kingsley seemed to conjecture my thoughts. A smile of lofty significance expressing a feeling
of mixed scorn and humility, rose upon his countenance--as if admitting his own feebleness,
while insisting upon his recovered strength, A sentence which he uttered to me in a whisper,
at this moment, was intended to convey some such meaning.

"It was only when thrown to the earth, Clifford, that the wrestler recovered his strength."

"That fable," I replied, "proves that he was no god, at least. Of the earth, earthy, he found
strength only in his sphere. The moment he aspired above it the god crushed him.  I doubt if
Hercules could have derived any benefit from the same source."

"Ah! I am no Hercules, but you will also find that I am no Antaeus. I fall, but I rise again,
and I am not crushed. This is peculiarly the source of HUMAN strength."

"Better not to fall."

"Ah! you are too late from Utopia. But--"

We were interrupted; a voice at my elbow--a soft, clear, insinuating voice addressed my companion:--

"Ah, Monsieur Kingsley, I rejoice to see you."

Kingsley gave me a single look, which said everything, as he turned to meet the new-comer.
The latter continued:--

"Though worsted in that last encounter, you do not despair, I see."

"No! why should I?"

"True, why? Fortune baffles skill, but what of that? She is capricious. Her despotism is feminine;
and in her empire, more certainly than any other, it may be said boldly, that, with change
of day there is change of doom. It is not always rain."

"Perhaps not, but we may have such a long spell of it that everything is drowned. 'It's a long
lane,' says the proverb, 'that has no turn;' but a man be done up long before he gets to the
turning place."

The other replied by some of the usual commonplaces by which, in condescending language, the
gamester provoked and stimulates his unconscious victim. Kingsley, however, had reached a period
of experience which enabled him to estimate these phrases at their proper worth.

"You would encourage me," he said quietly, and in tones which, to the unnoteful ear, would
have seemed natural enough, but which, knowing him as I did, were slightly sarcastic, and containing
a deeper signification than they gave out: "but you are the better player. I am now convinced
of that. Something  there is in fortune, doubtless; my self-esteem makes me willing to admit
that; and yet I do not deceive myself. You have been too much for me--you are!"

"The difference is trifling, very trifling, I suspect. A little more practice will soon reconcile
that."

"Ha! ha! you forget the practice is to be paid for."

"True, but it is the base spirit only that scruples at the cost of its accomplishments."

"Surely, surely!"

"You are fresh for the encounter to-night?"

"Pleasantly put! Is the query meant for the player or his purse?"

"Good, very good! Why, truly, there is no necessary affinity between them."

"And yet the one without the other would scarcely be able to commend himself to so excellent
an artist as Mr. Latour Cleveland. Clifford, let me introduce you to my ENEMY; Mr.  Cleveland,
my FRIEND."
