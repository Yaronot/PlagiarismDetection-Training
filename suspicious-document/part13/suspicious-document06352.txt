I suppose the same thing holds good with the hosts; they seldom have more than a superficial
acquaintance with their guests, and so often just when they do get to know you a bit better,
they leave off knowing you altogether.  There was rather a breath of winter in the air when
I left those Dorsetshire people.  You see, they had asked me down to shoot, and I'm not particularly
immense at that sort of thing.  There's such a deadly sameness about partridges; when you've
missed one, you've missed the lot--at least, that's been my experience.  And they tried to
rag me in the smoking-room about not being able to hit a bird at five yards, a sort of bovine
ragging that suggested cows buzzing round a gadfly and thinking they were teasing it.  So I
got up the next morning at early dawn--I know it was dawn, because there were lark-noises in
the sky, and the grass looked as if it had been left out all night--and hunted up the most
conspicuous thing in the bird line that I could find, and measured the distance, as nearly
as it would let me, and shot away all I knew. They said afterwards that it was a tame bird;
that's simply silly, because it was awfully wild at the first few shots.  Afterwards it quieted
down a bit, and when its legs had stopped waving farewells to the landscape I got a gardener-boy
to drag it into the hall, where everybody must see it on their way to the breakfast-room. 
I breakfasted upstairs myself.  I gathered afterwards that the meal was tinged with a very
unchristian spirit.  I suppose it's unlucky to bring peacock's feathers into a house; anyway,
there was a blue-pencilly look in my hostess's eye when I took my departure.

Reginald had left the selection of a feeding-ground to her womanly intuition, but he chose
the wine himself, knowing that womanly intuition stops short at claret.  A woman will cheerfully
choose husbands for her less attractive friends, or take sides in a political controversy without
the least knowledge of the issues involved--but no woman ever cheerfully chose a claret.

"Hors d'oeuvres have always a pathetic interest for me," said Reginald: "they remind me of
one's childhood that one goes through, wondering what the next course is going to be like--and
during the rest of the menu one wishes one had eaten more of the hors d'oeuvres.  Don't you
love watching the different ways people have of entering a restaurant?  There is the woman
who races in as though her whole scheme of life were held together by a one-pin despotism which
might abdicate its functions at any moment; it's really a relief to see her reach her chair

"Talking about hotels abroad," said the Duchess, "I am preparing notes for a lecture at the

"A husband who comes home with the Gulf Stream would be rather a tied- up asset."

"His wife is exceedingly sensible about it.  She collects postage-stamps. Such a resource.
Those people with her are the Whimples, very old acquaintances of mine; they're always having
trouble, poor things."

"Trouble is not one of those fancies you can take up and drop at any moment; it's like a grouse-moor
or the opium-habit--once you start it you've got to keep it up."

"Their eldest son was such a disappointment to them; they wanted him to be a linguist, and
spent no end of money on having him taught to speak--oh, dozens of languages!--and then he
became a Trappist monk.  And the youngest, who was intended for the American marriage market,
has developed political tendencies, and writes pamphlets about the housing of the poor.  Of
course it's a most important question, and I devote a good deal of time to it myself in the
mornings; but, as Laura Whimple says, it's as well to have an establishment of one's own before
agitating about other people's.  She feels it very keenly, but she always maintains a cheerful
appetite, which I think is so unselfish of her."

"There are different ways of taking disappointment.  There was a girl I knew who nursed a wealthy
uncle through a long illness, borne by her with Christian fortitude, and then he died and left
his money to a swine-fever hospital.  She found she'd about cleared stock in fortitude by that
time, and now she gives drawing-room recitations.  That's what I call being vindictive."

"Life is full of its disappointments," observed the Duchess, "and I suppose the art of being
happy is to disguise them as illusions.  But that, my dear Reginald, becomes more difficult
as one grows older."

"I think it's more generally practised than you imagine.  The young have aspirations that never
come to pass, the old have reminiscences of what never happened.  It's only the middle-aged
who are really conscious of their limitations--that is why one should be so patient with them.
But one never is."

"After all," said the Duchess, "the disillusions of life may depend on our way of assessing
it.  In the minds of those who come after us we may be remembered for qualities and successes
which we quite left out of the reckoning."

that crime, imputing to them was public atrocities of the kind.
  It began with little things, for no particular reason except
that her life was a rather empty one, and it is so easy to slip into the habit of telling the
truth in little matters.  And then it became difficult to draw the line at more important things,
until at last she took to telling the truth about her age; she said she was forty-two and five
months--by that time, you see, she was veracious even to months. It may have been pleasing
to the angels, but her elder sister was not gratified.  On the Woman's birthday, instead of
the opera-tickets which she had hoped for, her sister gave her a view of Jerusalem from the
Mount of Olives, which is not quite the same thing.  The revenge of an elder sister may be
long in coming, but, like a South-Eastern express, it arrives in its own good time.

The friends of the Woman tried to dissuade her from over-indulgence in the practice, but she
said she was wedded to the truth; whereupon it was remarked that it was scarcely logical to
be so much together in public. (No really provident woman lunches regularly with her husband
if she wishes to burst upon him as a revelation at dinner.  He must have time to forget; an
afternoon is not enough.)  And after a while her friends began to thin out in patches.  Her
passion for the truth was not compatible with a large visiting-list.  For instance, she told
Miriam Klopstock exactly how she looked at the Ilexes' ball. "you should not have been the elevation,"

  The play would be quite sufficient strain on one's
energies.  I should get a bishop to say it was immoral and beautiful--no dramatist has thought
of that before, and everyone would come to condemn the bishop, and they would stay on out of
sheer nervousness.  After all, it requires a great deal of moral courage to leave in a marked
manner in the middle of the second act, when your carriage isn't ordered till twelve.  And
it would commence with wolves worrying something on a lonely waste--you wouldn't see them,
of course; but you would hear them snarling and scrunching, and I should arrange to have a
wolfy fragrance suggested across the footlights.  It would look so well on the programmes,
'Wolves in the first act, by Jamrach.'  And old Lady Whortleberry, who never misses a first
night, would scream.  She's always been nervous since she lost her first husband.  He died
quite abruptly while watching a county cricket match; two and a half inches of rain had fallen
for seven runs, and it was supposed that the excitement killed him.  Anyhow, it gave her quite
a shock; it was the first husband she'd lost, you know, and now she always screams if anything
thrilling happens too soon after dinner.  And after the audience had heard the Whortleberry
scream the thing would be fairly launched."

"And the plot?"

"The plot," said Reginald, "would be one of those little everyday tragedies that one sees going
on all round one.  In my mind's eye there is the case of the Mudge-Jervises, which in an unpretentious
way has quite an Enoch Arden intensity underlying it.  They'd only been married some eighteen
months or so, and circumstances had prevented their seeing much of each other.  With him there
was always a foursome or something that had to be played and replayed in different parts of
the country, and she went in for slumming quite as seriously as if it was a sport.  With her,
I suppose, it was.  She belonged to the Guild of the Poor Dear Souls, and they hold the record
for having nearly reformed a washerwoman. No one has ever really reformed a washerwoman, and
that is why the competition is so keen.  You can rescue charwomen by fifties with a little
tea and personal magnetism, but with washerwomen it's different; wages are too high.  This
particular laundress, who came from Bermondsey or some such place, was really rather a hopeful
venture, and they thought at last that she might be safely put in the window as a specimen
of successful work.  So they had her paraded at a drawing-room "At Home" at Agatha Camelford's;
it was sheer bad luck that some liqueur chocolates had been turned loose by mistake among the
refreshments--really liqueur chocolates, with very little chocolate.  And of course the old
soul found them out, and cornered the entire stock.  It was like finding a whelk- stall in
a desert, as she afterwards partially expressed herself.  When the liqueurs began to take effect,
she started to give them imitations of farmyard animals as they know them in Bermondsey.  She
began with a dancing bear, and you know Agatha doesn't approve of dancing, except at Buckingham
Palace under proper supervision.  And then she got up on the piano and gave them an organ monkey;
I gather she went in for realism rather than a Maeterlinckian treatment of the subject.  Finally,
she fell into the piano and said she was a parrot in a cage, and for an impromptu performance
I believe she was very word-perfect; no one had heard anything like it, except Baroness Boobelstein
who has attended sittings of the Austrian Reichsrath.  Agatha is trying the Rest-cure at Buxton."

"But the tragedy?"

"Oh, the Mudge-Jervises.  Well, they were getting along quite happily, and their married life
was one continuous exchange of picture-postcards; and then one day they were thrown together
on some neutral ground where foursomes and washerwomen overlapped, and discovered that they
were hopelessly divided on the Fiscal Question.  They have thought it best to separate, and
she is to have the custody of the Persian kittens for nine months in the year--they go back
to him for the winter, when she is abroad.  There you have the material for a tragedy drawn
straight from life--and the piece could be called 'The Price They Paid for Empire.'  And of
course one would have to work in studies of the struggle of hereditary tendency against environment
and all that sort of thing.  The woman's father could have been an Envoy to some of the smaller
German Courts; that's where she'd get her passion for visiting the poor, in spite of the most
careful upbringing.  C'est le premier pa qui compte, as the cuckoo said when it swallowed its
foster-parent.  That, I think, is quite clever."

"And the wolves?"

"Oh, the wolves would be a sort of elusive undercurrent in the background that would never
be satisfactorily explained.  After all, life teems with things that have no earthly reason.
And whenever the characters could think of nothing brilliant to say about marriage or the War
Office, they could open a window and listen to the howling of the wolves.  But that would be
very seldom."

REGINALD ON TARIFFS

I'm not going to discuss the Fiscal Question (said Reginald); I wish to be original.  At the
same time, I think one suffers more than one realises from the system of free imports.  I should
like, for instance, a really prohibitive duty put upon the partner who declares on a weak red
suit and hopes for the best.  Even a free outlet for compressed verbiage doesn't balance matters.
And I think there should be a sort of bounty- fed export (is that the right expression?) of
the people who impress on you that you ought to take life seriously.  There are only two classes
that really can't help taking life seriously--schoolgirls of thirteen and Hohenzollerns; they
might be exempt.  Albanians come under another heading; they take life whenever they get the
opportunity.  The one Albanian that I was ever on speaking terms with was rather a decadent
example.  He was a Christian and a grocer, and I don't fancy he had ever killed anybody.  I
didn't like to question him on the subject--that showed my delicacy.  Mrs. Nicorax says I have
no delicacy; she hasn't forgiven me about the mice.  You see, when I was staying down there,
a mouse used to cake-walk about my room half the night, and none of their silly patent traps
seemed to take its fancy as a bijou residence, so I determined to appeal to the better side
of it--which with mice is the inside.  So I called it Percy, and put little delicacies down
near its hole every night, and that kept it quiet while I read Max Nordau's Degeneration and
other reproving literature, and went to sleep.  And now she says there is a whole colony of
mice in that room.

That isn't where the indelicacy comes in.  She went out riding with me, which was entirely
her own suggestion, and as we were coming home through some meadows she made a quite unnecessary
attempt to see if her pony would jump a rather messy sort of brook that was there.  It wouldn't.
It went with her as far as the water's edge, and from that point Mrs. Nicorax went on alone.
Of course I had to fish her out from the bank, and my riding-breeches are not cut with a view
to salmon-fishing--it's rather an art even to ride in them.  Her habit-skirt was one of those
open questions that need not be adhered to in emergencies, and on this occasion it remained
behind in some water-weeds.  She wanted me to fish about for that too, but I felt I had done
enough Pharaoh's daughter business for an October afternoon, and I was beginning to want my
tea.  So I bundled her up on to her pony, and gave her a lead towards home as fast as I cared
to go.  What with the wet and the unusual responsibility, her abridged costume did not stand
the pace particularly well, and she got quite querulous when I shouted back that I had no pins
with me--and no string. Marry i was in wont, without feeling, of tell conflict which will determine

  I used to listen to him with a rapt attention that I thought rather suited
me, and then one day I quite modestly gave the dimensions of an okapi I had shot in the Lincolnshire
fens.  The Major turned a beautiful Tyrian scarlet (I remember thinking at the time that I
should like my bathroom hung in that colour), and I think that at that moment he almost found
it in his heart to dislike me. Mrs. Babwold put on a first-aid-to-the-injured expression, and
asked him why he didn't publish a book of his sporting reminiscences; it would be so interesting.
She didn't remember till afterwards that he had given her two fat volumes on the subject, with
his portrait and autograph as a frontispiece and an appendix on the habits of the Arctic mussel.

It was in the evening that we cast aside the cares and distractions of the day and really lived.
Cards were thought to be too frivolous and empty a way of passing the time, so most of them
played what they called a book game.  You went out into the hall--to get an inspiration, I
suppose--then you came in again with a muffler tied round your neck and looked silly, and the
others were supposed to guess that you were "Wee MacGreegor."  I held out against the inanity
as long as I decently could, but at last, in a lapse of good-nature, I consented to masquerade
as a book, only I warned them that it would take some time to carry out.  They waited for the
best part of forty minutes, while I went and played wineglass skittles with the page-boy in
the pantry; you play it with a champagne cork, you know, and the one who knocks down the most
glasses without breaking them wins.  I won, with four unbroken out of seven; I think William
suffered from over-anxiousness.  They were rather mad in the drawing-room at my not having
come back, and they weren't a bit pacified when I told them afterwards that I was "At the end
of the passage."

"I never did like Kipling," was Mrs. Babwold's comment, when the situation dawned upon her.
"I couldn't see anything clever in Earthworms out of Tuscany--or is that by Darwin?"

Of course these games are very educational, but, personally, I prefer bridge.

On Christmas evening we were supposed to be specially festive in the Old English fashion. 
The hall was horribly draughty, but it seemed to be the proper place to revel in, and it was
decorated with Japanese fans and Chinese lanterns, which gave it a very Old English effect.
A young lady with a confidential voice favoured us with a long recitation about a little girl
who died or did something equally hackneyed, and then the Major gave us a graphic account of
a struggle he had with a wounded bear. I privately wished that the bears would win sometimes
on these occasions; at least they wouldn't go vapouring about it afterwards.  Before we had
time to recover our spirits, we were indulged with some thought-reading by a young man whom
one knew instinctively had a good mother and an indifferent tailor--the sort of young man who
talks unflaggingly through the thickest soup, and smooths his hair dubiously as though he thought
it might hit back.  The thought-reading was rather a success; he announced that the hostess
was thinking about poetry, and she admitted that her mind was dwelling on one of Austin's odes.
Which was near enough.  I fancy she had been really wondering whether a scrag-end of mutton
and some cold plum-pudding would do for the kitchen dinner next day. The Koine, when happening necessitate

     So I recast it entirely,
and the new version read--

   "The hen that laid thee moons ago, who knows
   In what Dead Yesterday her shades repose;
   To some election turn thy waning span
   And rain thy rottenness on fiscal foes."

I thought there was enough suggestion of decay in that to satisfy a jackal, and to me there
was something infinitely pathetic and appealing in the idea of the egg having a sort of St.
Luke's summer of commercial usefulness.  But the Duchess begged me to leave out any political
allusions; she's the president of a Women's Something or other, and she said it might be taken
as an endorsement of deplorable methods.  I never can remember which Party Irene discourages
with her support, but I shan't forget an occasion when I was staying at her place and she gave
me a pamphlet to leave at the house of a doubtful voter, and some grapes and things for a woman
who was suffering from a chill on the top of a patent medicine.  I thought it much cleverer
to give the grapes to the former and the political literature to the sick woman, and the Duchess
was quite absurdly annoyed about it afterwards.  It seems the leaflet was addressed "To those
about to wobble"--I wasn't responsible for the silly title of the thing--and the woman never
recovered; anyway, the voter was completely won over by the grapes and jellies, and I think
that should have balanced matters.  The Duchess called it bribery, and said it might have compromised
the candidate she was supporting; he was expected to subscribe to church funds and chapel funds,
and football and cricket clubs and regattas, and bazaars and beanfeasts and bellringers, and
poultry shows and ploughing matches, and reading-rooms and choir outings, and shooting trophies
and testimonials, and anything of that sort; but bribery would not have been tolerated. 

I begin milkshake, hop, brew, and small-suds, as i register to penny though till the world was one flat

"vast, sweet, and unprofitable."  I hunted back in my mind for the most familiar
French classic that I could take liberties with, and after a little exercise of memory I turned
out the following:--

   "Hast thou the pen that once the gardener had? When
   the attendance on the servant is required, it is spacious

  I mustn't
monopolise the conversation.)

"Of course, if you want something really Persian and passionate, with red wine and bulbuls
in it," I went on to suggest; but she grabbed the book away from me.

"Not for worlds.  Nothing with red wine or passion in it.  Dear Agatha gave me the album, and
she would be mortified to the quick"--
