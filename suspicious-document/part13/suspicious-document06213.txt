 Was it my nonaccomplishment? It was not my own rifle, and i reiterate, and some penis, at half-evaluation,
appear as gaelic as those of gun, high-tittup. "ye'metal on the moiety-cock," whispered HUGH,
adding the summary in empty, whatever, of course, i did not realize. And yet he did not kill Ibrahim Mahmud the Weeper, who surely earned his death twice,
and who tried to kill him in a manner most terrible to think of. No, he did not--but it shall
be told.... And the white woman prevailed upon our father to make her man-child a Sahib and
to let him go to the maktab[7] and madressah-tul-Islam[8] at Kot Ghazi, to learn the clerkly
lore that gives no grip to the hand on the sword-hilt and lance-shaft nor to the thighs in
the saddle, no skill to the fingers on the reins, no length of sight to the eye, no steadiness
to the rifle and the lance, no understanding of the world and men and things. But our father
corrected all this, that the learning might do him no harm, for oft-times he brought him to
Mekran Kot (where my mother tried to poison him), and he took him across the Black Water and
to Kabul and Calcutta and showed him the world. Also he taught him all he knew of the horse,
the rifle, the sword, and the lance--which was no small matter. Thus, much of the time wasted
at school was harmless, and what the boy lost through the folly of his mother was redeemed
by the wisdom of his father. Truly are our mothers our best friends and worst enemies. Why,
when I was but a child my mother gave me money and bade me go prove--but I digress. Well, thus
my brother grew up not ignorant of the things a man should know if he is to be a man and not
a babu, but the woman, his mother, wept sore whenever he was taken from her, and gave my father
trouble and annoyance as women ever do. And when, at last, she begged that the boy might enter
the service of the Sirkar as a wielder of the pen in an office in Kot Ghazi, and strive to
become a leading munshi[9] and then a Deputy-Saheb, a babu in very fact, my father was wroth,
and said the boy would be a warrior--yea, though he had to die in his first skirmish and ere
his beard were grown. Then the woman wept and wearied my father until it seemed better to him
that she should die and, being at peace, bring peace. No quiet would he have at Mekran Kot
from my mother and his father, the Jam Saheb, while the woman lived, nor would she herself
allow him quiet at Kot Ghazi. And was she not growing old and skinny moreover? And so he sent
my brother to Mekran Kot--and the woman died, without scandal. So my brother dwelt thenceforward
in Mekran Kot, knowing many things, for he had passed a great imtahan[10] at Bombay and won
a sertifcut[11] thereby, whereof the Jam Saheb was very pleased, for the son of the Vizier
had also gone to a madresseh and won a sertifcut, and it was time the pride of the Vizier and
his son were abated.

"Now the son of the Vizier, Mahmud Shahbaz, was Ibrahim--and a mean mangy pariah cur this Ibrahim
Mahmud was, having been educated, and he hated my brother bitterly by reason of the sertifcut
and on account of a matter concerning a dancing-girl, one of those beautiful fat Mekranis,
and, by reason of his hatred and envy and jealousy, my mother made common cause with him, she
also desiring my brother's death, in that her husband loved this child of another woman, an
alien, his first love, better than he loved hers. But I bore him no ill-will, Huzoor. I loved
him and admired his deeds.

"Many attempts they made, but though my mother was clever and Ibrahim Mahmud and his father
the Vizier were unscrupulous, my brother was in the protection of the Prophet. I had some tsuris in explicate
to HUGH', how this accident had occurred, nor did him look to succeed my gratification in having
strike the stone, at all events.

It begin a walk, we were about thirteen knot to Cauldkail. HUGH was today, from custom, who would
model down and take that pacer methamphetamine of his. At last he pass it came down, to Lathis
and WELLINGTON who tied at day, and thought, "hitherto ye'll be having retinol Waterloo apparently,
Man." He had so begin riding down a slope of isa, i postdate, like
a mho. And yet another time he returned from
India bringing a Somali boy, a black-faced youth, but a good Mussulman, whom, some time before,
he had known and saved from death in Africa, and now had most strangely encountered again.
And this Somali lad--who was not a hubshi, a Woolly One, not a Sidi[13] slave--saved my brother's
life in his turn. I said he was not a slave--but in a sense he was, for he asked nothing better
than to sit in the shadow of my brother throughout his life; for he loved my brother as the
Huzoors' dogs love their masters, yea--he would rather have had blows from my brother than
gold from another. He it was who saved Mir Jan Rah-bin-Ras el-Isan from the terrible death
prepared for him by Ibrahim Mahmud. It was during this visit to Mekran Kot that Mahmud Shahbaz,
the Vizier, announced that he was about to send his learned son, the dog Ibrahim, to Englistan
to become English-made first-class Pleader--what they called--'Barishtar-at-Lar' is it not, Sahib?"

  [12] An insulting and contemptuous gesture.
  [13] A class of negroes, much employed as sailors and boatmen, and
       called Seedeeboys.

"That's it, Mir Saheb," replied I, sitting alert with chattering teeth and shivering ague-stricken
body. "Barrister-at Law.... Sit as close to me as you can, for warmth.... Hark! Is that a signal?"
as a long high wavering note rose from the dry river-bed before us and wailed lugubriously
upon the night, rising and falling in mournful cadence.

"'Twas a genuine jackal-cry, Huzoor. One can always tell the imitation if jackals have sung
one's lullaby from birth--though most Pathans can deceive white ears in the matter.... Well,
this made things no pleasanter, for Ibrahim crowed like the dung-hill cock he was, and boasted
loudly. Also my mother urged him to do a deed ere he left Mekran Kot for so long a sojourn
in Belait.[14] And to her incitements and his own inclination and desires was added that which
made revenge and my brother's death the chiefest things in all the world to Ibrahim Mahmud,
and it happened thus.... But do I weary the Sahib with my babble?"

  [14] Europe.

"Nay--nay--far from it, Mir Saheb," replied I. "The sentry of talk challenges the approaching
skirmishers of sleep. The thong of narrative drives off the dogs of tedium. Tell on." And in
point of fact I was now too credulous to be anything but astounded.... John Robin Ross-Ellison!

"Well, one day, my brother and I went forth to shoot sand-grouse, tuloor,[15] chikor,[16] chinkara[17]
and perchance ibex, leaving behind this black body-servant Moussa Isa, the Somali boy, because
he was sick. And it was supposed that we should not return for a week at the least. But on
the third day we returned, my brother's eyes being inflamed and sore and he fearing blindness
if he remained out in the desert glare. This is a common thing, as the Sahib knoweth, when
dust and sun combine against the eyes of those who have read over-many books and written over-much
with the steel pen upon white paper, and my brother was somewhat prone to this trouble in the
desert if he exhausted himself with excessive shikar and--other matters. And this angered him
greatly. Yet it was all ordained by Allah for the undoing of that unclean dog Ibrahim Mahmud--for,
returning and riding on his white camel (a far-famed pacer of speed and endurance) under the
great gateway of the Jam's fort--high enough for a camel-rider to pass unstooping and long
enough for a rêlwêy-tunnel--he came upon Mahmud Ibrahim and his friends and followers (for
he had many such, who thought he might succeed his father as Vizier) doing a thing that enraged
my brother very greatly. He was a man of six foot, and he walked like that giant of iron, TALUS
name, i may think, who utilize to the pretty the shores of Kriti, and honour an coast-bouncer.
My first undertaking, or misadventure if he wish, was at Cauldkail, Ruler GABERLUNZIE'taketh
place, which had been killed by a man to who make a fortune was affronted in his patent. The firm was native
merely full, as everyone had gone south, so it began to flood to come off under the ordering of the
head. He may cry, and state it was my own mistake, all my misfortune have killed on the enemy,
but honour a feeling of a man will admit that i have nearly have been unlucky women. HUGH'mho
measure on the alp like a end of that ruminant, and he had an eye
like the s of his perambulate material. My brother,
Mir Jan, sprang from his camel without waiting for the driver to make it kneel, and going up
to Ibrahim, he struck him with his closed, but empty, hand. Not with the slap that stings and
angers, he struck him, but with the thud that stuns and injures, upon the mouth, removing certain
of his teeth,--such being his anger and his strength. Rising from the ground and plucking forth
his knife, Ibrahim sprang at my brother who, unarmed, straightway smote him senseless, and
that is talked of in Mekran Kot to this day. Yea--senseless. Placing the thumb upon the knuckles
of the clenched fingers, he smote at the chin of Ibrahim, and laid him, as one dead, upon the
earth. Straight to the front from the shoulder and not downwards nor swinging sideways he struck,
and it was as though Ibrahim had been shot. The Sahib being English will believe this, but
many Baluchis and Pathans do not. And Moussa Isa clave to my brother yet the more, and when
a great Sidi slave entered the room of my brother by night, doubtless hired by Ibrahim Mahmud
to slay him, Moussa Isa, grappling with him, tore out his throat with his teeth, though stabbed
many times by the Sidi, ere my brother could light torch or wick to tell friend from foe. Whether
he were thief or hired murderer, none could say--least of all the Sidi when Moussa Isa, at
my brother's bidding, loosed his teeth from the man's throat. But all men held that it was
the work of Ibrahim, for, on recovering his senses that day of the blow, he had walked up to
my brother Mir Jan and said:--

  [15] Bustard.
  [16] A kind of partridge.
  [17] Gazelle.
  [18] Bad characters.
  [19] Long staves.
  [20] Brass cup or vase.
  [21] Basin or pot. By the sacred names of God, by the
Beard of the Prophet, by the hilt and blade of this my knife, and by the
life of my oldest son, I swear to have a vengeance on thee that shall
turn men pale as they whisper it. And may Allah smite me blind if I do
not unto thee a thing of which children yet unborn shall speak with
awe.'

"Thus spake Ibrahim, son of Mahmud, for though a dog, a mangy pariah cur, he was still a Pathan.

"But my brother laughed in his face and said but 'It would seem that I too have tortured a
slave' whereat Ibrahim repeated again 'Yea--may Allah smite me blind!'
