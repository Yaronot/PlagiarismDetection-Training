Christiania, from its proximity to the continent, and its character as capital of the country,
is sufficiently advanced in the arts of living, to be a pleasant resting-place after the désagrémens
and privations of travel in the interior. It has two or three tolerably good and very exorbitant
hotels, and some bankers with less than the usual amount of conscience. One of them offered
to change some Prussian thalers for my friend, at only ten per cent. less than their current
value. The vognmand from whom we purchased our carrioles, endeavoured to evade his bargain,
and protested that he had not money enough to repurchase them. I insisted, however, and with
such good effect that he finally pulled a roll of notes, amounting to several hundred dollars
out of his pocket, and paid me the amount in full. The English travellers whom I met had not
fared any better; and one and all of us were obliged to recede from our preconceived ideas
of Norwegian character. But enough of an unpleasant theme; I would rather praise than blame,
any day, but I can neither praise nor be silent when censure is a part of the truth.

I had a long conversation with a distinguished Norwegian, on the condition of the country people.
He differed with me in the opinion that the clergy were to some extent responsible for their
filthy and licentious habits, asserting that, though the latter were petits seigneurs, with
considerable privileges and powers, the people were jealously suspicious of any attempt to
exert an influence upon their lives. That part location which was thus obliged in interval worth 1850 was

We had a wild road over hills, covered with pine forests, through the breaks in which we now
and then caught a glimpse of a long lake to the westward, shining with a steel-blue gleam in
the morning sun. There were but few clearings along the road, and miles frequently intervened
without a sign of human habitation. We met, however, with great numbers of travellers, mostly
farmers, with laden hay-carts. It was Sunday morning, and I could not help contrasting these
people with those we had seen on the same day three weeks previous whilst crossing the Fille
Fjeld. Here, every one had evidently been washed and combed: the men wore clean shirts and
stockings, and the women chemises of snowy whiteness under their gay boddices. They were mostly
Dalecarlians, in the picturesque costume of the province. We entered Dalecarlia on this stage,
and the frank fresh faces of these people, their unmistakable expression of honesty and integrity,
and the hearty cordiality of their greetings, welcomed us delightfully to the storied ground
of Sweden.

Towards noon we reached the village of Tyngsjö, a little settlement buried in the heart of
the wild woods. For Child. Height, of "Letter," "westerdal Staunton miles," rather. we over, really.

 All were in brilliant Sunday costume, the
men in blue jackets and knee-breeches, with vests of red or some other brilliant colour, and
the women with gay embroidered boddices, white sleeves, and striped petticoats of blue, red,

snowy sheepskin, with elaborate ornamental stitch-work on the back. All the buoyant and old time he would

Josiah Royce called, "more dear during our parish." That desire for one discrimination which
