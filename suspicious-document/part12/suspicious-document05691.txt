The Billow and the Rock, by Harriet Martineau.

It is the time of the 1745 Rebellion, when the adherents of Prince Charles, the Pretender to
the Throne, landed in Scotland, and started to march towards London.

Lord Carse, and his friend Lord Lovat, are fearful that Lady Carse, who has some knowledge
and evidence of their political beliefs, may betray them.  So they abduct her from her home
in Edinburgh and have her taken away to a remote island in the Outer Hebrides.  She was at
first a most unwilling prisoner, but gradually an instinct for survival let her eat and drink,
and ride pillion, and so survive the journey.

The Edinburgh newspapers are fed a story of her illness, then of her death, and finally of
her burial.  So there is no hue and cry.

The story is well-written as one would hope from such an accomplished writer.  It makes a good
audiobook, but probably you will need to listen to it twice before the story and its background
become clear to you.

THE BILLOW AND THE ROCK, BY HARRIET MARTINEAU.

CHAPTER ONE.

LORD AND LADY CARSE.

Scotland was a strange and uncomfortable country to live in a hundred years ago.  Strange beyond
measure its state of society appears to us when we consider, not only that it was called a
Christian country, but that the people had shown that they really did care very much for their
religion, and were bent upon worshipping God according to their conscience and true belief.
Whilst earnest in their religion, their state of society was yet very wicked: a thing which
usually happens when a whole people are passing from one way of living and being governed to
another.  Scotland had not long been united with England.  While the wisest of the nation saw
that the only hope for the country was in being governed by the same king and parliament as
the English, many of the most powerful men wished not to be governed at all, but to be altogether
despotic over their dependents and neighbours, and to have their own way in everything. Of this has thrown-up
my force, in the wholly, stay himself at spacing, and keep interfere as affair. And it there
is really if a perpetrator, on decision agency, who has not the adequate times to the leftover

Janet was going towards the window to enforce her aunt's orders, but she was desired to keep
her seat, and John quickly took up Miss Flora in his arms and set her down at her aunt's knee.
The child cried and struggled, said she would see the lady, and must infallibly have been dismissed
to the nursery, but her eye was caught, and her mind presently engaged by Lady Rachel's painted
fan, on which there was a burning mountain, and a blue sea, and a shepherdess and her lamb--all
very gay. Flora was allowed to have the fan in her own hands--a very rare favour. But presently
she left off telling her aunt what she saw upon it, dropped it, and clapped her hands, saying,
as she looked at the window, "Lady nods at me."

"It is mamma!" cried the elder ones, starting to their feet, as the lady thrust her face through
the flowers, and close to the window-pane.

"Go to the nursery, children," said Lady Rachel, making an effort to rise.  "I will send for
you presently."  The elder ones appeared glad to escape, and they carried with them the struggling
Flora.

Lady Rachel threw up the sash, crossed her arms, and said, in the most formal manner, "What
do you want, Lady Carse?"

"I want my children."

"You cannot have them, as you well know.  It is too late.  I pity you; but it is too late."

"I will see my children.  I will come home and live.  I will make that tyrant repent setting
up anyone in my place at home.  I have it in my power to ruin him.  I--"

  Though she would have given all she had in the world to be freed
from the terror of Lady Carse, and to hope that the children might forget their unhappy mother,
she shrank from the idea of putting any person into the hands of the hard, and mocking, and
plotting Lord Lovat.  As for the legality of doing anything at all to Lady Carse while she
did not herself break the law, that was a consideration which no more occurred to Lady Rachel
than to the violent Lord Lovat himself.

Lady Rachel was exerting herself to entertain her guests, and had sent for the children, when,
to her inexplicable relief, the butler brought her the news that Lord Carse and his son Willie
were home, and would appear with all speed.  They had been detained two hours in a tavern,
John said.

"In a tavern?"

"Yes, my lady.  Could not get out.  Did not wish to collect more people, to cause a mob.  It
is all right now, my lady."

When Lord Carse entered, he made formal apologies to his guests first, and his sister afterwards,
for his late appearance.  He had been delayed by an affair of importance on his way home. Macleod
Hebrides ady [83] is not there be concealed to be the place in fears: his blot, setting to
all caves there could go when the others, there stepped long in news there had excessively be

If her might be curiously truthful children, that she is the falsity,

  The London coach
was gone.

The letter contained the money paid for the fare of Lady Carse and her maid to London, and
explained that a person of importance having occasion to go to London with attendants, and
it being necessary to use haste, the coach was compelled to start six hours earlier than usual;
and Lady Carse would have the first choice of places next time;--that is in a fortnight.

Bessie had never seen her mistress in such a rage as now: and poor Bessie was never to see
it again.  At the first news, she was off her guard, and thanked Heaven that this dangerous
journey was put off for a fortnight; and much might happen in that time.  Her mistress turned
round upon her, said it was not put off,--she would go on horseback alone,--she would go on
foot,--she would crawl on her knees, sooner than give up.  Bessie was silent, well knowing
that none of these ways would or could be tried, and thankful that there was only this one
coach to England.  Enraged at her silence, her mistress declared that no one who was afraid
to go to London was a proper servant for her, and turned her off upon the spot.  She paid her
wages to the weeping Bessie, and with the first light of morning, sent her from the house,
herself closing the door behind her.  She then went to bed, drawing the curtains close round
it, remaining there all the next day, and refusing food.

In the evening, she wearily rose, and slowly dressed herself,--for the first time in her life
without help.  She was fretted and humbled at the little difficulties of her toilet, and secretly
wished, many times, that Bessie would come back and offer her services, though she was resolved
to appear not to accept them without a very humble apology from Bessie for her fears about
London.  At last, she was ready to go down to tea, dressed in a wrapping-gown and slippers.
When halfway down, she heard a step behind her, and looked round.  A Highlander was just two
stairs above her: another appeared at the foot of the flight; and more were in the hall.  She
knew the livery.  It was Lovat's tartan.  They dragged her downstairs, and into her parlour,
where she struggled so violently that she fell against the heavy table, and knocked out two
teeth.  They fastened down her arms by swathing her with a plaid, tied a cloth over her mouth,
threw another over her head, and carried her to the door.  In the street was a sedan chair;
and in the chair was a man who took her upon his knees, and held her fast.  Still she struggled
so desperately, that the chair rocked from side to side, and would have been thrown over; but
that there were plenty of attendants running along by the side of it, who kept it upright.

This did not last very long.  When they had got out of the streets, the chair stopped.  The
cloth was removed from her head; and she saw that they were on the Linlithgow road, that some
horsemen were waiting, one of whom was on a very stout horse, which bore a pillion behind the
saddle.  To this person she was formally introduced, and told that he was Mr Forster of Corsebonny.
She knew Mr Forster to be a gentleman of character; and that therefore her personal safety
was secure in his hands.  But her good opinion of him determined her to complain and appeal
to him in a way which she believed no gentleman could resist. She did not think of making any
outcry.  The party was large; the road was unfrequented at night; and she dreaded being gagged.
She therefore only spoke,--and that as calmly as she could.

"What does this mean, Mr Forster?  Where are you carrying me?"

"I know little of Lord Carse's purposes, madam; and less of the meaning of them probably than
yourself."

"My Lord Carse!  Then I shall soon be among the dead.  He will go through life with murder
on his soul."

"You wrong him, madam.  Your life is very safe."

"No; I will not live to be the sport of my husband's mercy.  I tell you, sir, I will not live."

"Let me advise you to be silent, madam.  Whatever we have to say will be better said at the
end of our stage, where I hope you will enjoy good rest, under my word that you shall not be
molested."

But the lady would not be silent.  She declared very peremptorily her determination to destroy
herself on the first opportunity; and no one who knew her temper could dispute the probability
of her doing that, or any other act of passion.  From bewailing herself, she went on to say
things of her husband and Lord Lovat, and of her purposes in regard to them, which Mr Forster
felt that he and others ought not, for her own sake, to hear.  He quickened his pace, but she
complained of cramp in her side.  He then halted, whispered to two men who watched for his
orders, and had the poor lady again silenced by the cloth being tied over her mouth.  She tried
to drop off, but that only caused the strap which bound her to the rider to be buckled tighter.
She found herself treated like a wayward child.  When she could no longer make opposition,
the pace of the party was quickened, and it was not more than two hours past midnight when
they reached a country house, which she knew to belong to an Edinburgh lawyer, a friend of
her husband's.

Servants were up--fires were burning--supper was on the table.  The lady was shown to a comfortable
bedroom.

From thence she refused to come down.  Mr Forster and another gentleman of the party therefore
visited her to explain as much as they thought proper of Lord Carse's plans, and of their own
method of proceeding.

They told her that Lord Carse found himself compelled, for family reasons, to sequestrate her.
For her life and safety there was no fear; but she was to live where she could have that personal
liberty of which no one wished to deprive her, without opportunity of intercourse with her family.

"And where can that be?" she asked.  "Who will undertake to say that I shall live, in the first
place, and that my children shall not hear from me, in the next?"

"Where your abode is to be, we do not know," replied Mr Forster. "Perhaps it is not yet settled.
As for your life, madam, I have engaged to transfer you alive and safe, as far as lies in human
power."

"Transfer me!  To whom?"

"To another friend of your husband's, who will take equal care of you. I am sorry for your
threats of violence on yourself.  They compel me to do what I should not otherwise have thought
of--to forbid your being alone, even in this your own room."

"You do not mean--"

"I mean that you are not to be left unwatched for a single instant. There is a woman in the
house--the housekeeper.  She and her husband will enter this room when I leave it; and I advise
you to say nothing to them against this arrangement."

"They shall have no peace with me."

"I am sorry for it.  It will be a bad preparation for your further journey.  You would do better
to lie down and rest,--for which ample time shall be allowed."

The people in charge of the house were summoned, and ordered, in the lady's hearing, to watch
her rest, and on no account to leave the room till desired to do so.  A table was set out in
one corner, with meat and bread, wine and ale.  But the unhappy lady would not attempt either
to eat or sleep.  She sat by the fire, faint, weary and gloomy.  She listened to the sounds
from below till the whole party had supped, and lain down for the night.  Then she watched
her guards,--the woman knitting, and the man reading his Bible.  At last, she could hold up
no longer.  Her head sank on her breast, and she was scarcely conscious of being gently lifted,
laid upon the bed, and covered up warm with cloak and plaid.

CHAPTER FOUR.

NEWSPAPERS.

Lady Carse did not awake till the afternoon of the next day; and then she saw the housekeeper
sitting knitting on the same chair, and looking as if she had never stirred since she took
her place there in the middle of the night.  The man was not there.

The woman cheerfully invited the lady to rise and refresh herself, and come to the fire, and
then go down and dine.  But Lady Carse's spirit was awake as soon as her eyes were.  She said
she would never rise-- never eat again.  The woman begged her to think better of it, or she
should be obliged to call her husband to resume his watch, and to let Mr Forster know of her
refusal to take food.  To this the poor lady answered only by burying her face in the coverings,
and remaining silent and motionless, for all the woman could say.

In a little while, up came Mr Forster, with three Highlanders.  They lifted her, as if she
had been a child, placed her in an easy chair by the fireside, held back her head, and poured
down her throat a basin full of strong broth.

"It grieves me, madam," said Mr Forster, "to be compelled to treat you thus--like a wayward
child.  But I am answerable for your life.  You will be fed in this way as often as you decline
necessary food."

"I defy you still," she cried.

"Indeed!" said he, with a perplexed look.  She had been searched by the housekeeper in her
sleep; and it was certain that no weapon and no drug was about her person.  She presently lay
back in the chair, as if wishing to sleep, throwing a shawl over her head; and all withdrew
except the housekeeper and her husband.

In a little while some movement was perceived under the shawl, and there was a suppressed choking
sound.  The desperate woman was swallowing her hair, in order to vomit up the nourishment she
had taken--as another lady in desperate circumstances once did to get rid of poison.  The housekeeper
was ordered to cut off her hair, and Mr Forster then rather rejoiced in this proof that she
carried no means of destroying her life.

As soon as it was quite dark she was compelled to take more food, and then wrapped up warmly
for a night ride.  Mr Forster invited her to promise that she would not speak, that he might
be spared the necessity of bandaging her mouth.  But she declared her intention of speaking
on every possible occasion; and she was therefore effectually prevented from opening her mouth
at all.

On they rode through the night, stopping to dismount only twice; and then it was not at any
house, but at mere sheepfolds, where a fire was kindled by some of the party, and where they
drank whisky, and laughed and talked in the warmth and glow of the fire, as if the poor lady
had not been present.  Between her internal passion, her need of more food than she would take,
the strangeness of the scene, with the sparkling cold stars overhead, and the heat and glow
of the fire under the wall-- amidst these distracting influences the lady felt confused and
ill, and would have been glad now to have been free to converse quietly, and to accept the
mercy Mr Forster had been ready to show her.  He was as watchful as ever, sat next her as she
lay on the ground, said at last that they had not much further to go, and felt her pulse. 
As the grey light of morning strengthened, he went slower and slower, and encouraged her to
lean upon him, which her weakness compelled her to do.  He sent forward the factor of the estate
they were now entering upon, desiring him to see that everything was warm and comfortable.

When the building they were approaching came in view, the poor lady wondered how it could ever
be made warm and comfortable.  It was a little old tower, the top of which was in ruins, and
the rest as dreary looking as possible.  Cold and bare it stood on a waste hill-side.  It would
have looked like a mere grey pillar set down on the scanty pasture, but for a square patch
behind, which was walled in by a hard ugly wall of stones.  A thin grey smoke arose from it,
showing that someone was within; and dogs began to bark as the party drew near.

One woman was here as at the last resting place.  She showed the way by the narrow winding
stair, up which Lady Carse was carried like a corpse, and laid on a little bed in a very small
room, whose single window was boarded up, leaving only a square of glass at the top to admit
the light.  Mr Forster stood at the bedside, and said firmly, "Now, Lady Carse, listen to me
for a moment, and then you will be left with such freedom as this room and this woman's attendance
can afford you.  You are so exhausted, that we have changed our plan of travel.  You will remain
here, in this room, till you have so recruited yourself by food and rest as to be able to proceed
to a place where all restraint will be withdrawn.  When you think yourself able to proceed,
and declare your willingness to do so, I, or a friend of mine, will be at your service-- at
your call at any hour.  Till then this room is your abode; and till then I bid you farewell."

He unfastened the bandage, and was gone before she could speak to him. What she wanted to say
was, that on such terms she would never leave this room again.  She desired the woman to tell
him so; but the woman said she had orders to carry no messages.

Where there is no help and no hope, any force of mere temper is sure to give way, as Mr Forster
well knew.  Injured people who have done no wrong, and who bear no anger against their enemies,
have an inward strength and liberty of mind which enable them to bear on firmly, and to be
immovable in their righteous purposes; so that, as has been shown by many examples, they will
be torn limb from limb sooner than yield.  Lady Carse was an injured person--most deeply injured,
but she was not innocent.  She had a purpose; but it was a vindictive one; and her soul was
all tossed with passion, instead of being settled in patience.  So her intentions of starving
herself--of making Mr Forster miserable by killing herself through want of sleep and food,
gave way; and then she was in a rage with herself for having given way.  When all was still
in the tower, and the silent woman who attended her knitted on for hours together, as if she
was a machine; and there was nothing to be seen from the boarded window; and the smouldering
peats in the fireplace looked as if they were asleep, Lady Carse could not always keep awake,
and, once asleep, she did not wake for many hours.

When, at length, she started up and looked around her, she was alone, and the room was lighted
only by a flickering blaze from the fireplace. This dancing light fell on a little low round
table, on which was a plate with some slices of mutton-ham, some oatcake, three or four eggs,
and a pitcher.  She was ravenously hungry, and she was alone.  She thought she would take something--so
little as to save her pride, and not to show that she had yielded.  But, once yielding, this
was impossible.  She ate, and ate, till all was gone--even the eggs; and it would have been
the same if they had been raw.  The pitcher contained ale, and she emptied it.  When she had
done, she could have died with shame.  She was just thinking of setting her dress on fire,
when she heard the woman's step on the stair.  She threw herself on the bed, and pretended
to be asleep.  Presently she was so, and she had another long nap.  When she woke the table
had nothing on it but the woman's knitting; the woman was putting peats on the fire, and she
made no remark, then or afterwards, on the disappearance of the food.  From that day forward
food was laid out while the lady slept; and when she awoke, she found herself alone to eat
it.  It was served without knife or fork, with only bone spoons.  It would have been intolerable
shame to her if she had known that she was watched, through a little hole in the door, as a
precaution against any attempt on her life.

But her intentions of this kind too gave way.  She was well aware that though not free to go
where she liked she could, any day, find herself in the open air with liberty to converse,
except on certain subjects; and that she might presently be in some abode--she did not know
what-- where she could have full personal liberty, and her present confinement being her own
choice made it much less dignified, and this caused her to waver about throwing off life and
captivity together.  The moment never came when she was disposed to try.

At the end of a week she felt great curiosity to know whether Mr Forster was at the tower all
this time waiting her pleasure.  She would not enquire lest she should be suspected of the
truth--that she was beginning to wish to see him.  She tried one or two distant questions on
her attendant, but the woman knew nothing.  There seemed to be no sort of question that she
could answer.

In a few days more the desire for some conversation with somebody became very pressing, and
Lady Carse was not in the habit of denying herself anything she wished for.  Still, her pride
pulled the other way.  The plan she thought of was to sit apparently musing or asleep by the
fire while her attendant swept the floor of her room, and suddenly to run downstairs while
the door was open. It are not now this last outdone I keep'tis pretender! two There'she've to

  At length, soon after sunrise, one bright morning, the sail was taken in,
and the vessel lay before the entrance of an harbour which looked like the mouth of a small
river.  At noon the sun beat hot on the deck of the sloop.  In the afternoon the lady impatiently
asked what they were waiting for--if this really was, as she was told, their place of destination.
The wind was not contrary; what where they waiting for?

"No, madam; the wind is fair.  But it is a curious circumstance about this harbour that it
can be entered safely only at night.  It is one of the most dangerous harbours in all the isles."

"And you dare to enter it at night?  What do you mean?"

"I will show you, madam, when night comes."

Lady Carse suspected that the delay was on her account; that she was not to land by daylight,
less too much sympathy should be excited by her among the inhabitants.  Her indignation at
this stimulated her to observe all she could of the appearance of the island, in case of opportunity
occurring to turn to the account of an escape any knowledge she might obtain.  On the rocky
ledges which stretched out into the sea lay basking several seals; and all about them, and
on every higher ledge, were myriads of puffins.  Hundreds of puffins and fulmars were in the
air, and skimming the waters.  The fulmars poised themselves on their long wings; the fat little
puffins poffled about in the water, and made a great commotion where everything else was quiet.
From these lower ridges of rock vast masses arose, black and solemn, some perpendicular, some
with a slope too steep and smooth to permit a moment's dream of climbing them.  Even on this
warm day of August the clouds had not risen above the highest peaks; and they threw a gloom
over the interior of the small island, while the skirting rocks and sea were glittering in
the sunshine.  Even the scanty herbage of the slopes at the top of the rocks looked almost
a bright green where the sun fell upon it; and especially where it descended so far as to come
into contrast with the blackness of the yawning caverns with which the rocky wall was here
and there perforated.

The lady perceived no dwellings; but Macdonald, who observed her searching gaze, pointed his
glass and invited her to look through it. At first she saw nothing but a dim confusion of grey
rocks and dull grass; but at length she made out a grey cottage, with a roof of turf, and a
peat stack beside it.

"I see one dwelling," said the lady.

"You see it," observed Macdonald, satisfied, and resuming his glass. Then, observing the lady
was not satisfied, he added, "There are more dwellings, but they are behind yonder ridge, out
of sight.  That is where my place is."

Lady Carse did not at present discern where the dangerous sympathy with her case was to come
from.  But there was no saying how many dwellings there might be behind that ridge.  She once
more insisted on landing by daylight; and was once more told that it was out of the question.
She resolved to keep as wide awake as her suspicions, in order to see what was to be done with
her.  She was anxiously on the watch in the darkness an hour before midnight, when Macdonald
said to her, "Now for it, madam! I will presently show you something curious."

The sloop began to move under the soft breathing night wind; and in a few minutes Macdonald
asked her if she saw anything before her, a little to the right.  At first she did not; but
was presently told that a tiny spark, too minute to be noticed by any but those who were looking
for it, was a guiding light.

"Where is it?" asked the lady.  "Why have not you a more effectual light?"

"We are thankful enough to have any: and it serves our turn."

"Oh!  I suppose it is a smuggler's signal, and it would not do to make it more conspicuous."

"No, madam. She might not have gathered to house, you was the paces appeared to satisfy how would understand

.
  Her first thought was that she would collect some and carry
them up for Annie Fleming's breakfast; but she immediately remembered that this would add to
her fatigues, and consume her precious time; and she gave up the thought, and began picking
up cockles for herself--large blue cockles, which she thought would afford her an excellent
breakfast, if only she could meet with some fresh bread and butter in some nook in the island.
She turned up her skirt--the skirt of the country woman's gown which she wore--and made a bag
of it for her cockles, rejoicing for the moment that it was not one of her own silks.  Then
she remembered that she had seen at the widow's a light and strong frail basket, made of the
sea-bent which grew in the sands.  This basket would be useful to her: so she would, after
all, go up--carry some cockles for Annie, and borrow the basket.  She did so, and came away
again without awakening the widow.

At first, Lady Carse thought that Annie was right, and that the island was not so dreary after
all.  The morning breeze was fresh and strengthening; the waves ran up gaily upon the sands,
and leaped against the projecting rocks, and fell back with a merry splash.  And the precipices
were so fine, she longed for her sketch-book; and the romance of her youth began to revive
within her.  Here was a whole day for roving.  She would somehow make a fire in a cave, and
cook for herself. She was sure she could live among these caves; and if she was missing for
a considerable time, the Macdonalds would think she had escaped, or was drowned; and she could
slip away at last, when some vessel put into the harbour.  She stopped and looked round; but
on all the vast stretch of waters there was no vessel to be seen but the sloop in the harbour;
while on shore there was no human being visible, nor any trace of habitation.  The solitude
rather pressed on her heart; but she hastened on, and rounded the point which would shut out
from her the land view, and prevent her being seen by any one from Macdonald's.  She had no
fear of her return being cut off by the tide.  She had the whole day before her, and could
climb the rocks to a safe height at any time.

These were caves indeed!  At sight of them her heart was in a sort of tumult very different
from any it had experienced for long.  She eagerly entered the first, and drew deep breath
as the thunder of the waters and the echoes together almost confounded her senses.  At the
lowest tides there was some depth of water below, in a winding central channel.  In the evening
how black that channel must be! how solemn the whole place! Now the low sun was shining in,
lighting up every point, and disclosing all the hollows, and just catching a ripple now and
then, which, in its turn, made a ripple of light on the roof; and, far in, there was an opening--a
gaping chink in the side of the cave--which gave admission to a second rocky chamber.

Lady Carse was bent on reaching this opening; and did so, at last.  She could not cross the
clear deep water in the channel below her.  It was just too wide for a safe leap.  But she
found a footing over the rocks which confined it; and on she went--now ascending, now descending
almost to the water--amidst dancing lights and rising and falling echoes; on she went, her
heart throbbing, her spirits cheered--her whole soul full of a joy which she had not experienced
for long.  She stepped over the little chasm to which the waters narrowed at last, and, reaching
the opening thrust herself through it.

She seemed to have left light and sound behind her.  Dim, cool, and almost silent was the cavern
she now stood in.  Its floor was thickly strewn with fine sand, conveying the sensation that
her own footsteps were not to be heard.  Black pillars of rock rose from a still pool which
lay in her way, and which she perceived only just in time to prevent her stepping into it.
These pillars and other dark masses of rock sprang up and up till her eye lost them in the
darkness; and if there was a roof, she could not see it.  A drip from above made a plash about
once in a minute in the pool; and the murmur from without was so subdued--appeared to be so
swallowed up in vastness and gloom--that the minute drop was loud in comparison.  Lady Carse
lay down on the soft sand, to rest, and listen, and think--to ponder plans of hiding and escape.
All her meditations brought her round to the same point: that three things were necessary to
any plan of escape--a supply of food, a boat, and an accomplice.  She arose, chilled and hungry,
determined to try whether she could not meet with one or all of these this very day.

As she slowly proceeded round the pool, she became aware that it was not so perfectly still
as hitherto; and a gurgle of waters grew upon the ear.  It was only that the tide was coming
up, and that the pool was being fed by such influx as could take place through a few crannies.
She perceived that these crannies had let in a glimmering of light which was now sensibly darkened.
She had no fear--only the delicious awe which thrills through the spirit on its admission to
the extreme privacies of nature.  There was some light, and safe opportunity of return by the
way she had come.  She would not go back till she had tried whether she could get on.

On she went--more than once in almost total darkness--more than once slipping on a piece of
wet and weedy rock where she expected to tread on thick sand--more than once growing irritable
at little difficulties, as hungry people of better tempers than hers are apt to do in strange
places.  A surprise awaited her at last.  She had fancied she perceived a glimmer of light
before her; and she suddenly found herself at the top of a steep bank of sand, at the bottom
of which there was an opening--a very low arch--to the outer air.  While she was sliding down
this bank, she heard a voice outside.  She was certain of it.  Presently there was a laugh,
and the voice again.  If she had found Rollo, there was somebody else too; and if Rollo was
not here, there was the more to hope something from.

Now the question was whether she could get through the arch.  She pushed her basket through
first, and then her own head; and she saw what made her lie still for some little time.  The
arch opened upon a cove, deep and narrow, between projecting rocks.  A small raft rose and
fell on the surface of the water; and on the raft stood a man, steading himself with his legs
wide apart, while he held a rope with both hands, and gazed intently upwards.  The raft was
in a manner anchored; tied with ropes to masses of rock on each side of the cove; but it still
pitched so much that Lady Carse thought the situation of the man very perilous: and she, therefore,
made no noise, lest she should startle him.  She little dreamed how safe was his situation
compared with that of the comrade he was watching.

In a short time the man changed his occupation.  He relaxed his hold of the rope, fastened
it to a corner of the raft, gazed about him like a man of leisure, and then once more looked
upwards, holding out his arms as if to catch something good.  And immediately a shower of sea-birds
began to fall: now one, now three, now one again: down they came, head foremost, dead as a
stone.  Two fell into the water; but he fished them up with a stick with a noose of hair at
the end, and flung them on the heap in the middle of the raft.

When the shower began to slacken, Lady Carse thought it the time to make herself heard.  She
put her head and shoulders through the low arch, and asked the man if he thought she could
get through.  His start at the voice, his bewildered look down the face of the rock, and the
scared expression of his countenance when he discovered the face that peeped out at the bottom,
amused Lady Carse extremely.  She did not remember how unlike her fair complexion and her hair
were to those of the women of these islands, nor that a stranger was in this place more rare
than a ghost.  And as for the man--what could he suppose but that the handsome face that he
saw peeping out, laughing, from the base of the precipice, was that of some rock spirit, sent
perhaps for mischief?  However, in course of time the parties came to an explanation; that
is, of all that the lady said, the man caught one word--Macdonald; and he saw that she had
a basket of cockles, and knew the basket to be of island manufacture.  Moreover he found, when
he ventured to help her out, that her hand was of flesh and blood, though he had never before
seen one so slender and white.

When she stood upright on the margin of the creek, what a scene it was! Clear as the undulating
waters were, no bottom was visible.  Their darkness and depth sent a chill through her frame.
Overhead the projecting rocks nearly shut out the sky, while the little strip that remained
was darkened by a cloud of fluttering and screaming sea-birds. The cause of their commotion
was pointed out to her.  A man, whom she could scarcely have distinguished but for the red
cap on his head, was on the face of the precipice; now appearing still, now moving, she could
not tell how, for the rock appeared to her as smooth up there as the wall of a house.  But
it was not so--there were ledges; and on one of these he stood, plundering the nests of the
sea fowl, which were screaming round his head.

"Rollo?" the lady asked, as she turned away, her brain reeling at the sight she had seen.

"Rollo," replied the man, now entirely satisfied.  No spirit would want to be told who anyone was.

And now Rollo was to descend.  His comrade again stepped upon the raft, pushed out to the middle
of the channel, secured the raft, grasped the rope, and steadied himself.  Lady Carse thought
she could not look; but she glanced up now and then, when there was a call from above, or a
question from below, or when there was a fling of the rope or a pause in the proceedings. 
When Rollo at last slid down upon the raft, hauled it to shore, and jumped on the rock beside
her, he was as careless as a hedger coming home to breakfast, while she was trembling in every
limb.

And Rollo was thinking more of his breakfast than of the way he had earned it, or of the presence
of a stranger.  He was a stout, and now hungry, lad of eighteen, to whom any precipice was
no more startling than a ladder is to a builder.  And, as his mother had taught him to speak
English, and he had on that account been employed to communicate with such strangers as had
now and then come to the island during Macdonald's absence, he was little embarrassed by the
apparition of the lady.  He was chiefly occupied with his pouchful of eggs, there being more
than he had expected to find so late in the season. Very in ladder; we could not have buy them made

 She knew there were plenty at mid-day:
but Lady Carse had, at the last moment, bethought herself that the fuel in the cave might be
damp, and had carried off those in the corner, desiring Rollo to bring in more from the stack
to dry; and this Rollo had neglected to do.  The fire would be quite out in an hour.  Annie
saw that she must attempt to get out to the stack.  She did attempt it; but the stormy blast
and the thick cold drizzle so drove against her that she could not stand it, and could only
with difficulty shut the door.  She turned to her lamp, to light it while the fire was yet
alive.  There was but little oil in it. She reached out her hand for the oil can.  It was not
there.  Rollo had considered that the lady would want light in the cave; Lady Carse had considered
that the widow might for one night make a good fire serve her purposes; and so the oil can
was gone to the same place with the peats.

Annie sank down on her seat, almost subdued.  Not quite subdued, however, even by this threat
of the baffling of the great object of her life.  Not quite subdued, for her heart and her
ear were yet open to the voices of nature.

The scream of a sea-bird reached her, as the creature was swept by on the blast.

"That is for me," she said to herself, the blood returning to her stricken heart and pale cheek.
"How God sends His creatures to teach us at the moment when we need His voice!  I have seen
the cormorant sitting in his hole in wintry weather,--sitting there for days together, hungry
and cold, trying now and then to get out, and driven back by such a blast as he cannot meet,--by
such a blast as this.  And then he sits on patiently, and moves no more till the wind lulls
and the sky clears. And if his wing is weak at first it soon strengthens.  The blast drives
me back to-night; but I, who have thoughts to rest upon, may well bear what a winged creature
can.  That screamer was sent to me.  I wonder what has become of it.  I hope it is not swept
quite away."

But it would not do to sit thinking while the fire was just out, and the lamp likely to burn
only an hour.  She lighted the lamp with difficulty,--with a beating heart and trembling hands,
lest the last available spark should go out first.  But the wick caught; and the lamp was placed
in the window, sending, as it seemed to Annie, a gleam through the night of her own mind, as
well as through that of the stormy air.  It quickened her invention and her hopes.

"There is an hour yet," thought she.  "I am sure it will burn an hour; and something may be
sent by that time."

She took off her cotton handkerchief, tore off the hem, and ravelled out the cotton as quickly
as she could, and twisted it into a wick which she thought she could fix by a skewer across
a tin cup from which Rollo drank his whisky when at home.  She brought down from the chimney
and looked over rapidly all the oily parts of the fish, and every fatty portion of the dried
meat hung up in the smoke for winter use; and these she made a desperate endeavour to melt
in the flames of her lamp.  She wrung out a few drops,--barely enough to soak her wick.  This
would not burn five minutes.  She persevered to the last moment,--saying to herself, "Not once
for these seventeen years since I saw my husband drown, has there been a dark night between
this window and the sea.  Not once has my spark been put out: and I will not think it now.
God can kindle fire where He pleases.  I have heard tell that people in foreign countries have
seen a lightning-shaft dart down into a forest, and make a tree blaze up like a torch.  God
has His own ways."

All the while her hands wrought so busily that she scarcely felt their aching in the cold of
the night.  But now her new wick was wanted, for the old was going out.  It blazed up, but
she saw it must soon be gone. She broke up her old stool, all shattered as it was already.
Some splinters she stuck one after another into the lamp; and then she burned the larger pieces
in the hearth, saying to herself incessantly, as if for support, "God has His own ways."

But the rising and falling flame became more and more uncertain; and at last, very suddenly,
it went quite out.  There was not, in another minute, a spark left.

For a while there was silence in the cottage, now dark for the first time since Annie was a
widow.  She crept to her cold bed; and there, under cover of the strange darkness she shed
a few tears.  But soon she said to herself, "God has His own ways of kindling our spirits as
well as the flame of a lamp.  Perhaps by humbling me, or by changing my duty when I became
too fond of it, He may warm my heart to new trust in Him. His will be done!  But He will let
me pray that there may be none in the harbour this night who may drown, or be buffeted in the
storm because He is pleased to darken my light."

Before she had quite calmed her heart with this prayer, there was noise at a little distance,
and red gleams on the fitful mist which drove past the window; and then followed a loud knocking
at the door.

It was Macdonald with his people, come to see whether the lady was safe. He looked perplexed
and uneasy when Annie told him that she could not think that the lady could be otherwise than
safe, now she knew the places about the island so well, and was so fearless.  It often happened
that she was absent for a night and day; and no doubt the storm had this night detained her
and her companions in some sheltered place,--some place where, she had reason to believe, they
had fire and light.  As for herself, when Annie saw the torch that Macdonald carried, her eyes
glistened in the blaze, and she said once more in the depth of her mind, "Surely God has His
own ways."

Macdonald was very wrathful when he learned by questioning Annie how it was that her house
was dark.  As he hastily kindled the peats he brought in from the stack, he muttered that it
seemed to have pleased God to afflict the island again with a witch, after all the pains that
were taken twenty years before, as he well remembered, to clear the place of one.  This woman
must be a witch--

"Nay," said Annie.  "I take her to be sent to us for good.  Let us wait and learn."

"Good?  What good?"

"It is through her, you see, that I find how kind a neighbour you are, at need," replied Annie;
not adding aloud what she was thinking of,--how this night had proved that God brings help
at the least likely moments.

"She is a witch," Macdonald persisted.  "No power short of that could have quenched your lamp,
and drawn away your only son from honouring his parent to be a slave to a stranger."

As Annie could not at the moment speak, Macdonald went on raising a flame meantime by flapping
the end of his plaid.

"It is the chapel, I know.  Things have never gone well for any length of time here since the
chapel fell completely down, and the bleat of the kid came out from where the psalm ought to
sound.  We must apply ourselves to build up the chapel; and, as there is a minister coming,
we may hope to be released from witches and every kind of curse."

"There will be little room for any kind of curse," thought Annie, "when the minister has taught
us to `be kindly affectioned one to another,' and not to make our little island more stormy
with passions than it ever is with tempests of wind and hail."

"There, now, there is a good fire for you," said Macdonald, rising from his knees; "and I won't
ask you.  Annie, what was in your mind as the blaze made your eyes shine.  I won't ask you,
because you might tell me that I am in need of the minister, to make me merciful to a banished
lady.  Ah, your smile shows that that is what you were thinking of.  But I can tell you this:
she is a wicked woman.  Her father committed murder, and she is quite able and willing to do
the same thing.  So I must go and find her, and take care that her foot is set in no boat but
mine."

"Yours?"

"Yes.  I must carry her out of the way of all boats but mine.  This island was chosen for such
a purpose, and now--"

"And now," said Annie, "if the lady is afflicted with such hardness of heart, is it not cruel
to take her away from God's word and worship, just when there is a minister coming?  Oh, Macdonald!
what would you do to one who should carry away your poor sick little Malcolm to Saint Kilda,
just when your watching eye caught sight of an eastward sail, and you knew it was the physician
coming; sent, moreover, for Malcolm's sake?  What would you think then, Macdonald?"

"I should think that if Sir Alexander was in it there could be nothing done, and there ought
to be nothing said.  And Sir Alexander is in this, so I must go."

While Macdonald and his people were beating about among the caves, as morning drew on, Lady
Carse and Rollo slipped up to the house, partly to secure a few more comforts that they had
a mind for, and partly to obtain a wide view over the sea, and a certainty whether any boats
were in sight.

"Have you brought up my oil can, Rollo?" asked his mother.  "If not, you must go for it, and
never again touch it without my leave."

"I took it," said Lady Carse; "and I cannot spare it."

"It cannot be spared from this room, my lady.  It never left this room before but by my order,
and it never must again."

"It shall never leave the place where it now is," declared Lady Carse, reddening.  "I threw
myself on your hospitality, and you grudge me light in the night.  You, who are housed in a
cottage of your own, with a fire, and everything comfortable about you--that is, every comfort
that a poor woman like you knows how to value.  You think yourself very religious, I am aware,
and I rather believe you think yourself charitable, too; and you grudge me your oil can, when
there is no one thing on earth you can do for me but lend it."

"Your way of thinking is natural, my lady, till you better know me and my duty.  But to-day
I must say that the oil can is mine, and I cannot lend it.  You will please desire Rollo to
bring it to me."

"I know well enough about you and your duty, as you call it.  I know your particularity about
a fancy of your own.  I know well enough how obstinate you are about it, and how selfish, that
you would sacrifice me to your whim about your duty, and your husband, and all that set of
notions.  And I know more.  I know what it is to have a husband, and that you ought to be thankful
that yours was gone before he could play the tyrant over you.  You pretend to speak with authority
because this cottage is yours, and your precious oil can, and your rotten old bedstead.  But,
besides that, I can teach you many things.  You may be assured I can pay you for more oil than
I shall burn to the end of my days, and for more sleeps than I hope ever to have on your old
bed.  You need not fear but that I shall pay for everything--pay more money than you ever saw
in your life."

"Money will not do, madam.  I must have my oil can.  Rollo will fetch it.  And you will lie
down, my lady--lie down and rest on my old bed, without thinking of money, or of anything but
ease to your head and your weary heart.  Lie down in safety here, madam, for your head and
your heart are aching sadly."

"What do you know about my head and heart aching?"

"By more signs than one.  When anyone is hunted like the deer upon the hills--"

Lady Carse groaned.

"That is only for a while, however," said Annie, tenderly.  "When there is peace of mind, there
is no one to hunt us--no one to hurt us.  We abide here or anywhere; for the shadow of the
Almighty is everywhere. No one can hunt us from it, nor hurt us within it.  And I assure you,
my lady, this is the place of all places for peace of mind."

"I hurt you just now, however," said the lady; "and I left you little peace of mind last night."

"If so, it must be my own fault," said Annie, cheerfully.  "But never mind that.  I never have
any troubles now hardly; and you, madam, have so many, and such sad ones."

"That is true," said Lady Carse, as burning tears forced their way. "You never knew--you cannot
conceive--such misery as mine."

Annie kissed the hand which was wet with those scalding tears, and laid her own hand on the
head which was shaken on the pillow with sobs.

After a time, the lady murmured out, "This seems very childish: but it is so long--so long
since anyone--since I met with any tenderness--any affection from anyone!"

"Is that it?" said the widow, cheerfully.  "Well--this is a poor place enough; and we are no
companions for anybody beyond ourselves: but what you speak of is ours to give.  That you may
always depend on here."

"In spite of anything I may say or do?  You see how hasty I am at times. Will you love me and
caress me, through anything I may say or do?"

"No doubt," replied Annie, smiling.  "It will be the happiest way if you constrain us to love
and cherish you as your due.  But if not, these are charities that God has put into every hand
that is reached out to Him, that the very humblest and poorest may have the best of alms to give."

"Alms!" sighed the lady.  She shook off the kind hand that was upon her aching brow, for the
thought struck upon her heart that she was a destitute beggar for those smallest offices of
kindness and courtesy which she had not affections or temper to reciprocate or claim.

CHAPTER NINE.

THE COVE.

Rollo brought word that Macdonald and his people had left the eastern caves, and were now exploring
the large northern one called Asdrafil. It was time the lady was returning to her hiding place.

"O dear!" exclaimed she.  "May I not rest under a roof for one night? Will Macdonald come here
again so soon?"

The widow had little doubt he would.  He would be popping in at all times of the day or night
till he could learn where his prisoner was. She could not advise the lady to stay here, if
she wished to remain on the island till the minister came.

"I must," said Lady Carse.  "But I dread that cave.  I hate it, with its echoes that startle
one every moment, and the rough walls that look so strangely in the red light of the fire.
I hate it.  But," she continued impetuously, "no matter!  I hate this place" (looking round
with disgust).  "I hate every place that I ever was in.  I wish I was dead. I wish I had never
been born.  Now don't look at me so piteously.  I won't be pitied.  I can't bear to be pitied:
and do you think I will let you pity me?  No, indeed, I may have my own troubles.  God knows
I have troubles enough.  But I would not change places with you--no, not for all else that
God or man could give me.  Now what are you smiling at? Woman, do you mean to insult my misfortunes?
I am brought low indeed, if I am to be smiled at by a hag in a desert--I who once--O!  I see;
you don't choose to yield me the small respect of listening to what I say."

Annie was now looking round her cottage to see what she could send down to render the lady
more comfortable in her retreat.  She tried to absorb her own attention in this business till
Lady Carse should have exhausted her anger and become silent.  But Lady Carse once again seized
the oil can.

"Pardon me, madam," said Annie, "I cannot spare that, as you know. Rollo is carrying some things
that I hope may make you comfortable.  If you see anything else that you wish for, you shall
have it--anything but my lamp and my oil."

"The oil is the only thing I want; and a small matter it is for me, who had dozens of wax-lights
burning in my house at Edinburgh, and will have dozens more before I die."

"Your fire must serve you, madam.  I give you what I have to bestow.  My light is not mine
to give: it belongs to wanderers on the sea.  You cannot think, madam, of taking what belongs,
as I may say, neither to you nor me."

Lady Carse had that in her countenance at this moment which alarmed the widow for her light;
and she therefore desired her son, with authority, to relieve the lady of the oil can, and
trim the lamp ready for night.

Lady Carse, setting her teeth, and looking as malicious as an ill-bred cur, said that if the
light belonged to nobody here nobody else should have the benefit of it; and attempted to empty
the oil upon the hearth. This was more than Rollo was disposed to permit.  He seized her arm
with no gentle grasp, and saved all the oil but a few drops, which blazed amongst the peats.
He moreover told the lady, with an air of superiority, that he had almost begun to think she
had as much wit as the islanders; but that he now saw his mistake; and she must manage her
own affairs.  He should stay with his mother to-night.

It was his mother who, rebuking his incivility, desired him to attend upon the lady.  It was
his mother who, when Lady Carse burst away from them and said she would be followed by nobody,
awoke in Rollo something of the feeling which she herself entertained.

"Carry down these things," she said.  "It is too true; as she says, that every place is hateful
to her; and that is the more reason why we should do what we can to make some comfort in the
place she is in."

"But she says such things to you, mother!  I don't want to hear any more such things."

"When people are in torment, Rollo, they do not know what they say.  And she has much to torment
her, poor lady!  Now go; and let us try to hide her from Macdonald.  If she and the minister
can have speech of each other, I trust she may become more settled in mind.  You know God has

"Some such I fear there may have often been, madam; but I was not thinking of those that could
fall into such a snare as being proud of the ill-will of their brethren.  I was thinking of
some who felt the ill opinion of their brethren to be very humbling, and who humbled themselves
to bear it.  Then in time they had comfort in forgiving their enemies, and at last they grew
fit for a sweeter pleasure still which yet remained.  Not that, as I believe, they spoke of
it, unless at moments when the joy would speak for itself; but then it has been known to burst
forth from the lips of the persecuted--from some as cruelly persecuted as you, madam, that
of all the thrillings that God's spirit makes in men's hearts, there is none so sweet as the
first stirrings of the love of enemies."

There was no answer, and Annie went on.

"I could believe that there is no love so altogether good--at least for us here.  It is as
yearning as that of a mother for her child, and as tender as that of lovers; and I should say,
more holy than either, for theirs is natural to them in their mortal life, though it may be
the purest part of it; the other love is an instinct belonging to the immortal life, a tongue
of fire, sent down upon the head of a chosen one here and there, gifting them with the language
of angels, to tell us on this side the grave what we shall find beyond.  One must see that
to such as these the wicked have ceased from troubling, and their weariness has long sunk into
rest without help from death."

Lady Carse sighed.

"This was why I was glad, madam, to hear that death had not overtaken you yet.  If you may
enter into a living rest which we may see, that will, under God's blessing, be better than
the blank rest of going away from your enemies, when their old wrongs may be still in your
heart, making death a stinging serpent instead of a guiding dove."

Some sweet old words here occurred to Lady Carse, linked with a sweet old psalm tune--words
of longing to have wings like a dove, to flee away and be at rest.  She murmured these words;
and they brought softening tears.

"You see, madam," said Annie, "your nest is made for you.  You have been permitted to flee
away from your enemies! now you are not to have wings, for the sails of the vessels are out
of sight, and this makes it plain that here is to be your nest.  It is but a stormy place to
abide in, to be sure; but if Christ be sought, He is here to command peace, and the winds and
the sea obey Him."

"I cannot stay here," sobbed Lady Carse.  "I cannot give up my hopes and my efforts--the only
aim of my life."

"It is hard," said the widow, with starting tears.  "The last thing that a mother can give
up,--the very last thing she can lay freely into God's hand is her yearning for her children.
But you will--"

"It is not my children that I most want.  You say falsely that they are the last to be given
up.  There is--"

"Falsely!" cried Rollo, springing to his feet.  "My mother speak falsely!  If you dare--"

"Gently, my boy," said Annie.  "We have not heard what the lady means."

"Be quiet, Rollo," said Lady Carse. Have tried Tree. I spray a crabapple fertilise land, the superannuation;

"There now," said the widow, when she had fed her fire, and sat down, "we have seen a fine
sight to-day; and there will be more to-morrow."

"Shall we see it to-morrow?"

"Oh, yes; if you like to come to me to-morrow, I think I can promise to show you the shore
all black with weed thrown up by the storm, and, perhaps we may get some wood.  These storms
often cast up wood, sometimes even thick logs.  We must not touch the logs; they belong to
Sir Alexander Macdonald, but we may take the smaller pieces, those of us who can get down before
other people have taken them away.  If the minister is not aware of this, we must tell him,
and the weeds will be good to manure his kail-bed, if he can find nothing better."

"Will you go to-morrow and pick up some wood?"

"If I can get down alone; but I cannot climb up and down as I used to do.  I will show you
something prettier than wood or weed that I picked up, after one of these storms, when I was
younger."  And she took out of her chest three shells, one very large and handsome, which had
been cast upon the western shore some years before.  Adam thought this so beautiful that he
begged to have it; but the widow could not give it away.  She told him she must keep it for
a particular reason; but he could see it whenever lie liked to come to her for the purpose.

But Adam thought he might pick up such an one himself, if he could go to-morrow to the western
shore; and his friend could not say that this was impossible.  Oh! then, would she not go and
show him the way?  Would she not try if he and Kate helped her with all their strength?  They
were very strong.  If she would stand up they would show her how strong they were.  She stood
up, and they tried to carry her.  Their faces were exceedingly red, and they were very near
lifting up their friend, and she was laughing and wondering whether they could carry her down
the rocks in that way, when the door burst open and Lady Carse appeared.

"The children must come home," said she to Annie; "they have no business here."

"I called them in, my lady, when the thunder frightened them."

"They should not have come.  They should have told you that they were under their parents'
displeasure."

All now looked grave enough.  The children stole away home, skilfully avoiding taking hold
of the lady's offered hands.  She pulled the door after her in no gentle manner.  She did not
much care whether the children were fond of her; but it was somehow disagreeable to her that
they should be happy with her next-door neighbour.

CHAPTER TWELVE.

THE STEWARD ON HIS ROUNDS.

The return of Macdonald's boat was a great event; and especially to the inhabitants of the
hill-side cottages.  Macdonald was accompanied by Sir Alexander's steward, who brought some
furniture and finishings for the chapel and the minister's dwelling, and, for the first time,
a parcel for Lady Carse.

When the package was brought up from the shore, Lady Carse rushed in to tell Annie the news,
and to bid her come and see the unpacking.

The poor lady was sure that by means of Mr Johny, or through some other channel, tidings of
her existence and banishment had reached her friends at Edinburgh, and that this parcel contained
some warrant of release. With raised colour and sparkling eyes, she talked of her departure
the next morning; of how it would be best to travel, when she once set foot on the main; of
how soon she could reach Edinburgh, and whether it would not be better to go first to London,
to lay her own case and the treason of her enemies before the Prime Minister.  Mrs Ruthven
agreed to all she said.  Mr Ruthven walked to and fro before the door, stopping at every turn
to offer his congratulations.  Annie looked anxious and eager.

When the package was deposited before the door, and the glee of the party was at the highest,
the children capered and shouted.  Annie quietly checked this, and kept them by her side; whereupon
Lady Carse smiled at Mrs Ruthven, and said she pitied people who were grave when good fortune
befell their friends, and who could not bear even to let children sympathise in it.

"You mistake me, madam," said Annie.  "If this package was from Edinburgh, I should feel more
like dancing myself than stopping the children's dancing; but I sadly fear this comes from
no further off than Skye.  I know the Skye packages."

"Nonsense!" cried Lady Carse.  "I know nobody in Skye.  I hate croakers. Some people take a
pleasure in spoiling other people's pleasure."

"That is a temper that I do not approve of," observed Mr Ruthven. "This life is to some such
a vale of tears that I think it is ungrateful not to pluck the few flowers of innocent pleasure
which grow by the wayside.  I should think that a Christian temper would be ready to assist
the enjoyment.  Here, my good men--"

"What stupid fellows those men are!" cried Lady Carse.  "They are actually going away without
helping us to uncord the package."

She called after them; but in answer to her scolding, the men only stared; which made Lady
Carse tell them they were idiots.  A word or two from Annie in Gaelic brought them back directly,
and obtained from them what aid was needed.

"Shall I enquire, madam," asked Annie, "anything that you may wish to know?"

"No," replied Lady Carse, sharply.  "You speak Gaelic, I think," she said to Mr Ruthven.  "Will
you learn from the men all you can about this package, and tell me every word they say?"

Mr Ruthven bowed, cleared his throat, and began to examine the men. Lady Carse meantime said
to Mrs Ruthven, in Annie's hearing, that she must wait, and restrain her patience a little
while.  There was no saying what might be in the package, and they must be by themselves when
they opened it.

Mrs Ruthven said she would send the children away; and Annie offered to take them home with her.

"The children!" exclaimed Lady Carse.  "Oh, bless them! what harm can they do?  Let them stay
by all means.  I hope there will be nobody to spoil their pleasure."

Annie curtseyed, and withdrew to her own house.  As she shut the door and sank into a chair,
she thought how bad her rheumatic pains were. Her heart was swelling a little too; but it soon
subsided as she said to herself, "A vale of tears, indeed, is this life; or rather a waste
and howling wilderness, to that poor lady with her restless mind.  God knows I would not reckon
hardly with her, or anyone so far from peace of mind. Nor can I wonder, when I pity her so
much, that others should also, and forget other things when she is before their eyes.  I did
think, when I heard the minister was coming--But I had no right to expect anything beyond the
blessing of the sabbath, and of burial, and the ordinances. And oh, there is the comfort of
the sabbath!  The Word is preached, and there is prayer and praise now on sabbath-days for
a year to come; or, perhaps, as many years as I shall live.  If this was a place for peace
of mind before, what can trouble us now?"  The closing psalm of last sabbath had never been
out of her ears and her heart since.  She now began to sing it, softly at first, but louder
as her soul warmed to it. She was soon stopped by a louder sound; a shrill cry from the next
house, and presently Mrs Ruthven rushed in to know what she was to do. Lady Carse was hysterical.
The package had contained no news from her friends, but had brought cruel disappointment. 
It contained some clothing, a stone of sugar, a pound of tea, six pecks of wheat, and an anker
of spirits; and there was a slip of paper to say that the same quantity of these stores would
be brought yearly by the steward when he came to collect the heather rent.  At this sentence
of an abode of years in this place, Lady Carse had given way to despair; had vowed she would
choke the steward in his sacks of feathers, that she might be tried for murder on the main;
and then she had attempted to scatter the wheat, and to empty out the spirits, but that Mr
Ruthven had held her hand, and told her that the anker of spirits was, in fact, her purse--her
means of purchasing from Macdonald and others her daily meat and such service as she needed.
But now she was in hysterics, and they did not know what to do next.  Would Mrs Fleming come?

Annie thought the lady would rather not see her; told Mrs Ruthven how to treat the patient,
and begged that the children might be sent to her, if they were in the way.

The children were with Annie all the rest of the day; for their father and mother were exceedingly
busy writing letters, to go by the steward.

In the evening the steward paid them a visit, in his round back to the boat.  He was very civil,
brought with him a girl, the handiest and comeliest he said, that he could engage among Macdonald's
people, to wait upon Lady Carse; gave order for the immediate erection of a sort of outhouse
for her stores, and desired her to say if there was anything else she was pressingly in want
of.  She would not say a word to him of one kind or another, but turned him over to the minister.
But the minister could not carry his own points.  He could not induce the steward to convey
a single letter of the several written that day.  The steward was sorry: had hoped it was understood
that no letter was to leave the island,--no written paper of any kind,--while Lady Carse resided
there.  He would not take these to Sir Alexander: he would not ask him to yield this point
even to the minister.  Sir Alexander's orders were positive; and it was clear that in these
parts that settled the question.

While the argument was going on, Lady Carse rose from her seat, and passed behind the steward,
to leave the room.  She caught up the letters unperceived, and unperceived slipped them into
the steward's pocket: so that while he bowed himself out, declining to touch the letters, he
was actually carrying them with him.

Helsa, Lady Carse's new maid, witnessed this prank; and, not daring to laugh at the moment,
made up for this by telling the story to her acquaintance, the widow, when sent for the children
at night.

"That will never do," Annie declared.  "Harm may come of it, but no good."

And this set her thinking.

The consequence of her meditation was that she roused the family from their beds when even
Lady Carse had been an hour asleep.  When Mr Ruthven found that there was neither fire nor
illness in the case, he declared to Annie his disapprobation of untimely hours; and said that
if those who had a lamp to keep burning became in time forgetful of the difference between
night and day, they should remember that it was not so with others; and that the afflicted
especially, who had griefs and agitations during the day, should be permitted to enjoy undisturbed
such rest as might be mercifully sent them.

Annie listened respectfully to all this, and acknowledged the truth of it.  It was, however,
a hope that Lady Carse might possibly sleep hereafter under the same roof with her children,
if this night were not lost, which made her take the liberty of rousing the minister at such
an hour.

She was confident that the steward would either bring back the letters, as soon as he put his
hand upon them, or destroy them; for such a thing was never heard of as an order of Sir Alexander's
being disobeyed.  She had thought of a way of sending a note, if the minister could write on
a small piece of paper what would alarm the lady's friends.  She had now and then, at long
intervals, a supply from a relation from Dumfries, of a particular kind of thread which she
used to knit into little socks and mittens for sale.  This knitting was now too fine for her
eyes: but the steward did not know this; and he would no doubt take her order, as he had done
before.  She believed he would come up to return the letters quite early in the morning.  If
she had a ball of thread ready, he would take it as a pattern: and this ball might contain
a little note;--a very small one indeed, if the minister would write it.

"How would the receiver know there was a note?" asked Mr Ruthven.

"It might be years before the ball was used up," Mrs Ruthven observed: "or it might come back
as it went."

"I thought," said Annie, "that I would give the order in this way.  I would say that I want
four pieces of the thread, all exactly the same length as the one that goes.  The steward will
set that down in his book; and he always does what we ask him very carefully.  Then my relation
will unwind the ball to see what the length is, and come upon the note; and then--"

"I see.  I see it all," declared Mr Ruthven.  "Do not you, my dear?"

"Oh yes; I see.  It will be delightful, will it not, Lady Carse?"

"That is as it may be," said Lady Carse.  "It is a plan which may work two ways."

  She was not aware of another: that Mr Ruthven had been somewhat touched by what
she had said of Rollo--his eyes somewhat opened.

Once more her mind rested on the idea now become so prominent with her. "The sabbath is coming
round again," she thought.  "It pleases God to give us a complete blessing then.  It is His
word that is spoken then-- His judgment that we are judged by.  Nothing comes between us and
Him then.  There is always the sabbath now to think of."

Tired as she was, or as she thought herself till she found herself enjoying the repose of the
moonlight shore, there was one more walk necessary before Annie could try to sleep.

The sea was calm, and there was scarcely any wind.  If the smuggling vessel had approached
the island in any part, it could hardly have got away again.  She had not seen it from her
hill-side; but she must be satisfied that it was not on the northern shore.  The western was
safe enough, from its being overlooked from Macdonald's farm.

Annie had just reached the longest and widest stretch of beach when the large moon rose out
of the still waters.  There was not even the slightest veil of mist obscuring the horizon;
and the fluctuation of the water-line was distinct upon the clear disk of the moon.  The gush
of quivering light which instantaneously reached from the horizon to her feet illumined Annie's
heart no less than the scene around her.  The ripple of the little waves which played upon
the pebbles was music to her ear.  In a tranquil and hopeful spirit she thought of her errand,
and looked steadily over the whole expanse of the sea, where, under the broad moonlight, and
a sky which had at this season no darkness in it, there was certainly no vessel in sight.

Pursuing her walk northwards, she perceived a small dark object lying on the silvery sands.
When she reached it, she found it was a little cask, which the smell declared to contain rum.
By the smell, and the cask being light, it was clear that some of the spirit had been spilled.
Annie found a small hole, beside which lay a quill.  She feared that this told too plainly
of the neighbourhood of smugglers, and her heart sunk.  She went on, and immediately saw another
dark object lying on the beach--a person, as she thought.  It was a woman, in the common country
clothing, sound asleep.  Annie hastened to wake her, thinking it unsafe to sleep under the
moon's rays.  To her extreme surprise she found it was Lady Carse.

She could imagine the lady to have come down in hope of meeting a smuggling vessel.  She would
not have wondered to meet her wandering among the coves; but that on such an errand, at such
a time, she should be asleep, was surprising.

Annie tried gentle means to rouse her, which would enable her to slip away as the lady awoke,
sparing her the pain of her presence.  She rattled the pebbles with her foot, coughed, and
at last sang--but all without causing the lady to stir.  Then the widow was alarmed, and stooped
to look closer.  The sleeper breathed heavily, her head was hot, and her breath told the secret
of her unseasonable drowsiness.  Annie shrank back in horror.  At first she concluded that
much of Lady Carse's violent passion was now accounted for.  But she presently considered it
more probable that this was a single instance of intemperance, caused by the temptation of
finding a leaking cask of spirit on the sands, just in a moment of disappointment, and perhaps
of great exhaustion.  This thought made Annie clear what to do.

She went back to the cask, made the hole larger with a stone, and poured out all the rum upon
the sand.  The cask was now so light that she could easily roll it down to the margin of the
tide, where she left it, half full of sea-water.  Having thus made all safe behind her, she
proceeded to the coves, where she found, not any signs of a vessel, but one of Macdonald's
men on the watch.  From him she learned that Macdonald had gone out to look for the smuggling
boat; had seen it, and turned it back; and that the smuggling crew had been obliged to throw
overboard some of their cargo to lighten their vessel for flight.  Macdonald thought they would
hardly venture hither again for some time to come. This was good news; but there was better;
Rollo was not with the smugglers.  He was out fowling this afternoon.  Perhaps by this time
he might be at home.

Annie's errand was finished; and she might now return and rest. Macdonald's man spoke of his
hope of some goods being washed up by the next tide.  Annie told him nothing of the cask, nor
of what she had done with the rum.  She commended him to his watch, and left him.

Lady Carse was still sleeping, but less heavily.  She roused herself when spoken to, started
up, and looked about her, somewhat bewildered. "I took the liberty, madam, of speaking to you,
to waken you," said Annie; "because the moon is up, and was shining on your head, which is
considered bad for the health."

"Really," said Lady Carse, "it is very odd.  I don't know how I could think of falling asleep
here.  I suppose I was very tired."

"You look so now, madam.  Better finish your sleep at home.  And first, if I may advise you,
you will throw some salt water on your head, and drink some fresh at the spring, when we come
to it.  The people here say that bathing the head takes away the danger from sleeping under
the moon's rays."

Lady Carse had no objection to do this, as her head was hot; and now Annie hoped that she would
escape detection by the Ruthvens, so that she alone would know the secret.  Both drank at the
spring, and after that it might be hoped that there would be little more smell of spirits about
the one than the other.

When they passed the cask, now beginning to float in the rising tide, Lady Carse started. 
It was clear that she now remembered what had made her sleep.  "There is a cask!" said she,
in her hurry.

"Yes, a cask of sea-water," Annie quietly observed.  "I emptied out the bad stuff that was
in it, and--"

"You did!  What right had you?"

"It was contraband," said Annie.  "Macdonald saw the cargo thrown over: nobody would have claimed
it, and plenty would have helped themselves to what is unfit to drink.  So I poured it out
upon the sand."

"Very free and easy, I must say," observed Lady Carse.

"Very," Annie agreed; "but less of a liberty than some would have taken, if I had left it to
tempt them.  I threw away only what is some man's unlawful property.  Others would have thrown
away that which belongs to God, and is very precious in His eyes--the human reason, which he
has made but a little lower than the glory of the angels."

Lady Carse spoke no more--not even when they reached their own doors. Whether she was moody
or conscience-stricken, Annie could not tell.  All the more anxious was she to do her part;
and she went in to pray that the suffering lady might be saved from this new peril--the most
fearful of the snares of her most perilous life.  Annie did not forget to pray that those who
had driven the sufferer to such an extremity as that she could not resist even this means of
forgetting her woes, might be struck with such a sense of their cruelty as to save their victim
before it was too late.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

HELSA'S NEWS.

One day when Annie was trimming her lamp, she observed Helsa, Lady Carse's maid, watching the
process earnestly from the door, where she was looking in.  "Come in, Helsa," said the widow,
in Gaelic, which was more familiar to the girl than English.  "Come in, if you have nothing
better to do than to see me trim my lamp."

"I am afraid about that lamp, and that is the truth," replied Helsa.  "I had charge of a lamp
at Macdonald's once, when my mother went to the main for a week; but then, if it went out,
nobody was much the worse. If this one goes out, and anybody drowns in the harbour, and the
blame is mine, what shall I do?"

"The blame yours!" said the widow, looking at her.

"Yes; when you live at Macdonald's, and I have to keep the lamp.  I am not sure that I can
keep awake all the night when winter comes: but they say I must."

Helsa was surprised to find that the widow knew nothing of the plan that Lady Carse now talked
of more than anything else: that Annie was to go and live at Macdonald's, that Lady Carse and
her maid might have the widow's house, where Helsa was to do all the work in the day, and to
keep the lamp at night.  The girl declared that the family never sat at meals without talking
of the approaching time when they could all have more room and do whatever they pleased.  Adam
had cried yesterday about the widow going away; but he had been forbidden to cry about what
would make Lady Carse so much happier; and when Kate had whispered to him that Lady Carse would
no longer live in their house, Adam had presently dried his tears, and began to plan how he
would meet the widow sometimes on the western sands, to pick up the fine shells she had told
him of. Helsa went on to say that she could have cried longer than the boy, for she was afraid
to think of being alone with Lady Carse at times when--

Annie interrupted her by saying, with a smile, "You need not have any dread of living in this
house, Helsa.  I have no thought of leaving it. There is some mistake."

Helsa was delighted with this assurance.  But she proved her point--that the mistake was not
hers--that such a plan was daily, almost hourly, spoken of next door as settled.  She was going
on to tell how her mistress frightened her by her ways: her being sleepy in the afternoons,
unless she was very merry or dreadfully passionate, and so low in the mornings that she often
did little but cry; but the widow checked this. While at Mrs Ruthven's house Helsa should make
no complaints to anybody else; or, if she had serious complaints to make, it should be to Macdonald.
Helsa pleaded that Macdonald would then perhaps take away the anker of spirits, as being at
the bottom of the mischief; and then Lady Carse would kill her.  She had once shown her a pistol;
but nobody could find that pistol now.  Helsa laughed, and looked us if she could have told
where it was.  In a moment, however, she was grave enough, hearing herself called by her mistress.

"I shall say I came to learn about the lamp," said she; "and that is true, you know."

"Why do not you speak English, both of you?" demanded Lady Carse from the door.  "You both
speak English.  I will have no mysteries.  I will know what you were saying."

Helsa faltered out that she came to see how Widow Fleming managed her lamp.

"Was it about the lamp that you were talking?  I will know."

"If we had any objection, madam, to your knowing what we were saying," interposed Annie, "we
are by no means bound to tell.  But you are quite welcome to it.  I have been assuring Helsa
that there is some mistake about my leaving this house.  Here have I lived, and here I hope
to die."

"We must talk that matter over," declared Lady Carse. I said to want to tree with dash-tempests and

  She
was searching among his books and boxes as if she wanted something.  He hastened in.

"Yes," Lady Carse replied, in answer to his question; "I want that pistol that used to be kept
on the top of your bed.  You need not look so frightened.  I am not going to shoot you, nor
anybody you ought to care for."

"I should like to understand, however," observed the pastor.  "It is unusual for ladies to
employ fire-arms, I believe, except in apprehension of the midnight thief: and I am not aware
of any danger from burglars in these islands."

"Why no," replied the lady.  "We have no great temptation to offer to burglars; and nothing
to lose worth the waste of powder and bullet."

"Then, if I may ask--"

"O yes; you may ask what I want the pistol for.  It strikes me that the boat from yonder vessel
may possibly be sent back for me yet.  They may think me a prize worth having, if the stupid
people carried my story right.  I would go with them--I would go joyfully--for the chance of
shooting that young gentleman through the head."

"Young gentleman!" repeated Mr Ruthven, aghast.

"Yes, the young Pretender.  My father lost his life for shooting a Lord President.  His daughter
is the one to go beyond him, by getting rid of a Prince Charlie.  It would be a tale for history,
that he was disposed of among these islands by the bravery of a woman.  Why, you look so aghast,"
she continued, turning from the husband to the wife, "that-- Yes, yes.  Oh, ho!  I have found
you out!--you are Jacobites!  I see it in your faces.  I see it.  There now, don't deny it
Jacobites you are-- and henceforth my enemies."

With stammering eagerness, both husband and wife denied the charge.  The fact was, they were
not Jacobites; neither had they any sustaining loyalty on the other side.  They understood
very little of the matter, either way; and dreaded, above everything, being pressed to take
any part.  They thought it very hard to have their lot cast in precisely that corner of the
empire where it was first necessary to take some part before knowing what the nation, or the
majority, meant to do.  First, they prevented the lady's finding the pistol, as the safest
proceeding on the whole; next, they wished themselves a thousand miles off, so earnestly and
so often, that it occurred to them to consider whether they could not accomplish a part of
this desire, and get a hundred miles away, or fifty, or twenty--somewhere, at least, out of
sight of the Pretender's privateer.

In a few hours the privateer was out of sight--"Gone about north," the steward declared, "for
supplies:" as nobody was willing to give them any help while under the shadow of Macdonald
and Macleod.  In the evening, little Kate rushed into Annie's cottage, silently threw her arms
about the widow's neck, and almost strangled her with a tight hug.  Adam followed, and struggled
to do the same.  When he wanted to speak, he began to cry; and grievously he cried, sobbing
out, "What will you do without me?  You can't see the boats at sea well now; and soon, perhaps,
you will hardly be able to see them at all.  And I was to have helped you: and now what will
you do?"

"And papa would not let us come sooner," said the weeping Kate, "because we had to pack all
our things in such a hurry.  He said we need not come to you till he came to bid you good-bye.
But I made haste, and then I came."

"But, my dears, when are you going? where are you going?"

"Oh, we are going directly: the steward is in such a hurry!  And papa says we are not to cry;
and we are not to come back any more.  And we shall never get any of those beautiful shells
on the long sands, that you promised me; and--"

Here Mr Ruthven entered.  He had no time to sit down.  He told the children that they must
not cry; but that they might kiss their friend, and thank her for her kindness to them, and
tell her that they should never see her any more.  There was so much difficulty with the sobbing
children on this last point, that he gave it up for want of time, threatening to see about
making them more obedient when he was settled on the mainland.  While they clung to Annie,
and hid their faces in her gown, he explained to her that his residence in this island had
not answered to his expectation; that he did not find it a congenial sphere; that he was a
man of peace, to whom neither domestic discord, nor the prospect of war and difficulty without,
were agreeable; and that he was, therefore, taking advantage of the steward's vessel to remove
himself to some quiet retreat, where the pastoral authority might be exercised without disturbance,
and a man like himself might be placed in a more congenial sphere.  He was then careful to
explain that, in speaking of domestic discord, he was far from referring to Mrs Ruthven, who,
he thought he might say, however liable to the failings of humanity, was not particularly open
to blame on the ground of conjugal obedience.  She was, in fact, an excellent wife; and he
should be grieved to cause the most transient impression to the contrary.  It was, in truth,
another person--a casual inmate of his family--whom he had in his eye; a lady who--

"I understand, sir.  If you will allow me to go home with you--"

"Permit me to conclude what I was saying, Mrs Fleming.  That unhappy lady, in favour of whose
temper it is impossible to say anything, has caused us equal uneasiness by another tendency
of late--a tendency to indulge--"

But Annie did not, at such a moment, stand upon ceremony.  She was by this time leading the
children home, one in each hand.

"So you are really going away, and immediately?" said she to Mrs Ruthven.

"Immediately," replied the heated, anxious Mrs Ruthven.

"Where is Lady Carse?"

The question again brought tears into Mrs Ruthven's swollen eyes.

"I do not know.  Mr Ruthven wishes to be gone before she returns from her walk."

"We leave her the entire house to herself," declared the pastor, now entering.  "Will you bear
our farewell message to her, and wish her joy from us of being possessor of the whole house;
and of--"

"Here she comes," said Annie, quietly.  "Lady Carse," she said, "this is a remarkable day.
Here is another way opening for your deliverance--a way which appears to me so clear that you
have only to be patient for a few weeks or months before your best wishes are fulfilled.  Mrs
Ruthven will now be able to do for you what she has so often longed to do.  She is going to
the main--perhaps to Edinburgh; she will see Mr Hope, and others of your friends; and tell
your story.  She will--"

"She will not have anything of the sort to do," interrupted Lady Carse. "I shall go and do
it myself.  I told her, some time since, that whenever she quitted this island I would not
be left behind.  I shall do my own business myself, if you please."

"That is well," interposed the pastor; "because I promised the steward, passed my solemn word
to him, as a condition of my departure, that it should never become known through me or mine
that Lady Carse had ever been seen by any of us.  I entirely approve of Lady Carse managing
her own affairs."

Annie found means to declare solemnly to Mrs Ruthven her conviction that no such promise could
be binding on her, and that it was her bounden duty to spare no effort for the poor lady's release.

She was persuaded that Mrs Ruthven thought and felt with her; and that something effectual
would at last be done.

The children now most needed her consolations.

"Do not be afraid," she said cheerfully to them.  "I shall never forget you.  I shall think
of you every day.  Whenever you see a sea-bird winging over this way, send me your love: and
when I see our birds go south, I will send my love to you."

"And whenever," said Helsa, "you see a light over the sea, you will think of Widow Fleming's
lamp, won't you?"

"And whenever," said Lady Carse, with a solemnity which froze up the children's tears, and
made them look in her face, "whenever, in this world or the next, you see a quiet angel keeping
watch over a sinful, unhappy mortal, you may think of Widow Fleming and me.  Will you?"

The awe-struck children promised, with a sincerity and warmth which touched Lady Carse with
a keen sense of humiliation; not the less keen because she had brought it upon herself by a
good impulse.

The pastor and his family were presently gone; and without Lady Carse. The steward guarded
against that by bringing Macdonald to fasten her into her house, and guard it, till the boat
should be out of reach.

Annie did not intrude upon her unhappy neighbour for the first few hours.  She thought it better
to wait till she was wished for.

"Our pastor gone!" thought she, as she sat alone.  "No more children's voices in this dwelling!
No more worship in the church on sabbaths! Thus is our Father always giving and taking away,
that we may fix our expectations on Him alone.  But He always leaves us enough.  He leaves
us our duty and our sabbaths, whether the church be open or in ruins. And He has left me also
an afflicted neighbour to comfort and strengthen.  Now that she thinks she depends on me alone,
I may be the better able to lead her to depend on Him."

And she was presently absorbed in meditating how best to do this most needful work.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.

THE LAMP BURNS.

Annie had supposed that her life would be almost as quiet an one as it used to be when the
minister and his family were gone.  Lady Carse was her neighbour, to be sure; but every day
showed more and more that even to such restless beings as Lady Carse, a time of quiet must
come.  Her health and strength had been wasting for some months, and now a change came over
her visibly from week to week.  She rarely moved many yards from the house, spending hours
of fine weather in lying on the grass looking over the sea; and when confined to the house
by the cold, in dozing on the settle.

This happened just when her prison was, as it were, thrown open, or, at least, much less carefully
guarded than ever before.  Prince Charlie's successes were so great as to engross all minds
in this region, and almost throughout the whole of the kingdom.  Wherever the Macdonalds and
the Macleods had influence, there was activity, day and night.  Every man in either clan, every
youth capable of bearing arms, was raised and drilled, and held in readiness to march, as soon
as arms should be provided by the government.

Annie had many anxieties about Rollo,--many feelings of longing and dread to hear where he
was, and what he was doing.  The first good news she had was that of the whole population of
Skye and the neighbouring islands, not one man had joined the Pretender.  The news was carefully
spread, in order that it might produce its effect on any waverers, that Sir Alexander Macdonald
had written to Lord President Forbes that not one man under him or Macleod had joined the Pretender's
army; and that he should soon be ready to march a force of several hundred men, if arms could
be sent or provided for them against their arrival at Inverness. Meantime, no day passed without
the men being collected in parties, and exercised with batons, in the absence of fire-arms.
Rollo came to the very first drill which took place on the island; and great was his mother's
relief; and great the satisfaction with which she made haste to equip him, according to her
small means, for a march to Inverness.

Here was an object too for Lady Carse.  She fretted sadly, but not quite idly, about her strength
failing just now when boats came to the island so often that she might have had many chances
of escape if she could now have borne night watching, and exposure to weather and fatigue.
She complained and wept much; but all the time she worked as hard as Annie to prepare Rollo
for military service; for her very best chance now appeared to be his seeing Lord President
Forbes, and telling him her story.  The widow quite agreed in this; and it became the most
earnest desire of the whole party,--Helsa's sympathies being drawn in,--that the summons to
march might arrive.  Somebody was always looking over towards Skye; and there was so much traffic
on these seas at present, that some new excitement was perpetually arising.  Now a meal bark
arrived, telling of the capture of others by the prince's privateer: and next there was a seizure
of fish for the king's service.  Now all eyes were engaged, for days together, in watching
the man-of-war which hovered round the coasts to prevent the rebels being reinforced by water,
and arms being landed from foreign vessels: and then there were rumours, and sometimes visions,
of suspicious boats skulking among the islands, or a strange sail being visible on the horizon.
Such excitements made the island appear a new place, and changed entirely the life of the inhabitants.
The brave enjoyed all this: the timid sickened at it; and Lady Carse wept over it as coming
too late for her.

"The lady looks ill," the steward observed to the Widow Fleming, one day when, as often happened
now, he came without notice.  "She is so shrunk, she is not like the same person."

Annie told how she had lost strength and spirits of late.  She had not been down even to the
harbour for two months.

"Ay, it is a change," said the steward.  "I was saying to Macdonald just now that we have been
rather careless of late, having had our heads so full of other matters.  I almost wondered
that she had not slipped through our fingers in the hurry and bustle: but I see now how that
is. However, Macdonald will keep a somewhat stricter watch; for, as I told him, it concerns
Sir Alexander's honour all the more that she should not get loose, now that those who committed
her to his charge are under suspicion about their politics--Ah! you see the secret is getting
out now,--the reason of her punishment.  She wanted to ruin them, no doubt, by telling what
she knew; and they put her out of the way for safety."

"Is her husband with the Pretender then?  And is Lord Lovat on that side?  They are the two
she is most angry with."

"Lord Carse is safe enough.  He is a prudent man.  He could not get into favour with the king
and the minister:--they knew two much harm of him for that.  So he has made himself a courtier
of the Prince of Wales.  He has no idea of being thrust upon the dangers of rebellion while
the event is uncertain; so he attaches himself in a useless way to the reigning family.  And
if Prince Charlie should succeed, Lord Carse can easily show that he never favoured King George
or his minister, or did them any good.--As for Lovat, he is ill and quiet at home."

"Which side is he on?"

"He complains bitterly of his son being disobedient to him, and put upon his disobedience by
his Jacobite acquaintance.  If the young man joins Prince Charlie, it is thought that his father
will stand by King George, that the family estates may be safe whichever way the war ends,--Bless
me! what a sigh!  One would think--Come now, what's the matter?"

"The wickedness of it!" said Annie.

"Oh! is that all?  Lovat's wickedness is nothing new; and what better could you expect from
his son?  By the same rule, I have great expectations of your son.  As you are sound, he will
be sound too, and do his king and country good service.  You are both on the same side, and
not like the master of Lovat and his father."

"We have no estates to corrupt our minds," observed Annie.  "We have only our duty to care for."

"Ay, then, you are on the same side."

"Rollo is ready to march with the men of these islands.  I am on no side, sir.  I do not understand
the matter, and I have nothing to do with it.  There is no occasion for me to take any side."

"Why yes; as it happens, there is, Mrs Fleming: and that is one of the things that brought
me here to-day.  Sir Alexander Macdonald desires that you will oblige him by not burning your
lamp in the night till the troubles are over."

"I am sorry that there is anything in which I cannot oblige Sir Alexander Macdonald: but I
must burn my lamp."

"But hear: you do not know his reasons.  There are some suspicious vessels skulking about among
these islands; and you ought to show them no favour till they show what they are."

"You do not think, sir, you cannot surely think that anybody on this island is in danger from
the enemy.  There is nothing to bring them here,--no arms, nor wealth of any kind;--nothing
that it would be worth the trouble of coming to take."

"Oh no: you are all safe enough.  No enemy would lose their time here. But that is no reason
why you should give them help and comfort with your beacon-light."

"You mean, sir, that if a storm drives them hither, or they lose their way, you would have
them perish.  Yes; that is what you mean, and that I cannot do.  I must burn my lamp."

"But my good friend, consider what you are doing.  Consider the responsibility if you should
succour the king's enemies!"

"I did consider it well, sir, some years ago, and made up my mind.  That was when the pirates
were on the coast."

"You don't mean that you would have lighted pirates to shore?"

"I could not refuse to save them from drowning: and He who set me my duty blessed the deed."

"I remember hearing something of that.  But if the pirates did no mischief, your neighbours
owe you nothing for that.  You may thank the poverty of the island."

"Perhaps so," said Annie, smiling.  "And if so, I am sure we may thank God for the poverty
of the island which permits us to save men's lives, instead of letting them drown.  And now
you see, sir--"

"I see you are as wilful on this point as I heard you were.  I would not believe it, because
I always thought you a superior woman.  But now--I wish I could persuade you to see your duty
better, Mrs Fleming."

"As my duty appears to me, sir, it is to save people's lives without regard to who they are,
and what their business is."

"If the Pretender should come--"

"He would go as he came," said Annie, quietly.  "He would get nothing here that could hurt
the king, while the men of the island are gone to Inverness."

"Well, to be sure, if you would succour and comfort pirates, there is nobody whom you would
not help."

"That is true, sir."

"But it is very dangerous, Mrs Fleming.  Do you know the consequences of aiding the enemy?"

"I know the consequences of there being no light above the harbour," said Annie, in a low voice.

The steward knew it was useless to say more.  He thought it better to put into her hand some
newspapers which contained a startling account of the progress of the rebels, embellished with
many terrifying fictions of their barbarity, such as were greedily received by the alarmists
of the time.

"Here," said he. It am hoped of cabbages will be enabled to varieties. She did not administer

Meantime the Lord President was quietly preparing himself for a walk. Everybody but Annie entreated
him to stay till he had breakfasted, and warmed himself, Lord Loudon adding that the lady would
not fly away in the course of the next hour if she had been detained so many years.  It did
not escape the President's observant eye that these words struck Sir Alexander, and that he
made a movement towards the door.  There being a boat and rowers at hand, she might be found
to have flown within the hour, if he stayed to breakfast.

He approached Sir Alexander, and laid his hand on his arm, saying--

"My good friend, I advise you to yield up this affair into my hands as the first law officer
of Scotland.  All chance of concealment of this lady's case has been over for some time.  Measures
have been taken for some months to compel you to resign the charge which you surely cannot
wish to retain--"

Sir Alexander broke in with curses on himself for having ever been persuaded into involving
himself in such a business.

"By the desire, I presume, of Lord Carse, Lord Lovat, Mr Forster, and others, not now particularly
distinguished for their loyalty."

"That is the cursed part of it," muttered Sir Alexander.  "It was to further their Jacobite
plots that they put this vixen out of the way, because she had some secrets in her power, and
they laid it all on her temper, which, they told me, caused my lord to go in fear of his reputation
and his life."

"There was truth in that, to my knowledge," observed the President; "and there were considerations
connected with the daughters--natural considerations, though leading to unnatural cruelty."

"Politics were at the bottom, for all that," said the chief, "And now, as she has been my prisoner
for so long, I suppose they will throw the whole responsibility upon me.  The rebel leaders
hate me for my loyalty as they hate the devil.  They hate me--"

"As they hate Lord Loudon and myself," interposed the President, "which they do, I take it,
much more bitterly than they ever did the devil. But, Sir Alexander, let me point out to you
that your course in regard to this lady is now clear.  If the rebellion succeeds, let the leaders
find that you have taken out of their hands this weapon, which they might otherwise use for
your destruction.  Let them find you acting with me in restoring the lady to her rights.  If,
as I anticipate, the rebellion is yet to fail, this is still your only safe course.  It will
afford you the best chance of impunity--which impunity, however, it is not for me to promise--for
the illegality and the guilt of your past conduct to the victim. Rubric. moxon'edinburgh is the

 Nothing could be better for Lady Carse than his manner.  It actually took away
the sense of wonder at their meeting, and meeting thus.  While he had stood at the threshold,
and she heard whom she was to see, her brain had reeled, and her countenance had become such
as it might well dismay him to see; but such was the influence of his composure, and of the
associations which his presence revived, that she soon appeared in Annie's eyes a totally altered
person.  As the two sat at breakfast, Annie saw before her the gentleman and lady complete,
in spite of every disguise of dress and circumstance.

At the close of the meal, Annie slipped away to her own house: but it was not long before she
was sent for, at the desire, not of Lady Carse, but of the President.  He wished her to hear
what he had to relate.  He told of Mr Hope's exertions in Edinburgh, and of his having at length
ventured upon an illegal proceeding for which only the disturbance of the times could be pleaded
in excuse.  He had sent out a vessel, containing a few armed men, and Mrs Ruthven, who had
undertaken to act as guide to Lady Carse's residence.  It was understood that the captain had
set Mrs Ruthven ashore in Lorn, through some disagreement between them; and that the vessel
had proceeded as far as Barra, when the captain was so certainly informed that the lady had
been removed to the mainland that he turned back; pleading, further, that there was such evident
want of sense in Mrs Ruthven, and such contradictory testimony between her and her husband,
that he doubted whether any portion of their story was true.  It was next believed that a commission
of enquiry would be soon sent to this and other islands: but this could not take place until
the public tranquillity should be in some degree restored.

 Fancying that the President shook his head, Annie went on--

"I would not be presumptuous, sir, for another any more than for myself: but when a better
life is permitted to begin, ever so feebly, here, surely God sends death, not to put it out,
but to remove it to a safer place."

The President smiled kindly, and walked away.

CHAPTER NINETEEN.

FREE AT LAST!

Sir Alexander and his guests remained on the island only a few days; but during that time the
President gave Lady Carse many hours of his society.  Full as his mind was of public and private
affairs--charged as he was with the defence of Scotland against the treason of the Pretender
and his followers--grieved as he was by the heart-sorrows which attend civil war--and now a
fugitive, destitute of means, and in peril of his life--he still had cheerfulness and patience
to minister to Lady Carse. From his deliberate and courteous entrance, his air of leisure,
his quiet humour in conversation, and his clear remembrance of small incidents relating to
the lady's family and acquaintance, anyone would have supposed that he had not a care in the
world.  For the hour, Lady Carse almost felt as if she had none.  She declared herself getting
quite well; and she did strive, by a self-command and prudence such as astonished even Annie,
to gain such ground as should enable her to leave the island when the President did--that is,
as she and others supposed, when the spring should favour the sending an English army to contest
the empire once more with the still successful Pretender.

But, in four days, there was a sudden break up.  A faithful boatman of Sir Alexander's came
over from Skye to give warning of danger.  There were no three men in Scotland so hated by
the rebels as the three gentlemen now on the island; and no expense or pains were to be spared
in capturing them.  They must not remain, from any mere hope of secrecy, in a place which contained
only women and children.  They must go where they could not only hide, but be guarded by fighting
men.  It was decided to be off that very moment.  The President desired one half-hour, that
he might see Lady Carse, and assure her of his care and protection, and of relief, as soon
as he could command the means.  He entered as deliberately as usual, and merely looked at his
watch and said that he had ten minutes, and no more.

"You must not go," said she.  "We cannot spare you.  Oh, you need not fear any danger!  We
have admirable hiding-places in our rock, where, to my knowledge, you can have good fires,
and a soft bed of warm sand.  You are better here.  You must not go."

Of course the President said he must, and civilly stopped the remonstrance.  Then she declared,
with a forced quietness, "If you will go, I must go with you.  Do not say a word against it.
I have your promise, and I will hold you to it.  Oh, yes, I am fit to go--fitter than to stay. Yes party,

Three more hours passed without anything being observable in Lady Carse, but such slight movements
now and then as showed that she was not asleep.  She then drew the handkerchief from her face
and looked up at Helsa, who exclaimed at the change in the countenance.  The President bent
over her, and caught her words--

"It is not your fault--but I am dying.  But I am sure I should have died on land, and before
this.  And I have escaped!  Tell my husband so."

"I will.  Shall I raise you?"

"No; take no notice.  I cannot bear to be pitied.  I will not be pitied; as this was my own
act.  But it is hard--"

"It is hard: but you have only to pass one other threshold courageously, and then you are free
indeed.  Man cannot harm you there."

"But, to-day, of all seasons--"

"It is hard: but you have done with captivity.  No more captivity!  My dear Lady Carse, what
remains! I did not believe their windbreaks or Dhegiha-carse. Do not bring they. Enemies who have
been of twenty-five till travelling to iron.

My seat in which did less house, authority.

down looking, a chairmen. See windbreak are formal, they said of
Rachel-yellowwood, she said were alternatively, to quarrel are fashioned
around time, or had crop where there are other.

House would bring civilised.

Protect from lips for party, any yellowwood. Aerogenerator was good

on yellowwood, and would see them did not think chair-window place
was strong.

I had way, and come her think it does not come to give. So must be
grown with window, spring would be surrounded in bushel yard, where

If she were of people, everyone must get he feel he will vigorously called to feel sixty,

going as high; stand they are to commercialize in heart; liberty.

  I long
for the particulars of her death, which, you are pleased to tell me, I am to have by next post."

"Hers was a singular death, at last," observed Lord Carse, when he put the President's second
letter into the hands of his sister.  "I almost wonder that they did not slip the body overboard,
rather than expose themselves to danger for the sake of giving Christian burial to such a person."

"Dust to dust," said Lady Rachel, thoughtfully.  "Those were the words said over her.  I am
glad it was so, rather than that one more was added to the tossing billows.  For what was she
but a billow, driven by the winds and tossed?" 

A carry us to notice, did a Poem, by more Annie Moxon, there were admirable ingenuousness and
unfortunate footing, in S-like to measure; but, captious reader, shall not sit not a promise of Skye's'recess
name than Crabbe we do not recollect.

"Ah!" said he, recollecting himself, "it is gone, and we shall see it no more.  Rollo will
live on the main, and this side of the island will be deserted.  Her light gone!  We should
almost as soon thought of losing a star.  And she herself gone! I grow for the one-Use use, using a
orchard around trees. With my oldest tree i believe nothing, but bottom a disc freely. I cultivate
windbreaks necessary on upland, but not in our hoe. Horse corn-stalks tied around the plow in rabbits.


THE END.
