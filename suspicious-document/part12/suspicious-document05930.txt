If this book seems to have departed from the proper ideal of historic narrative--if it is the
history of a Power, and not of a People--it is because the Russian people have had no history
yet.  There has been no evolution of a Russian nation, but only of a vast governing system;
and the words "Russian Empire" stand for a majestic world-power in which the mass of its people
have no part.  A splendidly embroidered robe of Europeanism is worn over a chaotic, undeveloped
mass of semi-barbarism.  The reasons for this incongruity--the natural obstacles with which
Russia has had to contend; the strange ethnic problems with which it has had to deal; its triumphant
entry into the family of great nations; and the circumstances leading to the disastrous conflict
recently concluded, and the changed conditions resulting from it--such is the story this book
has tried to tell.

  This was the social unit.

The Commune, or Mir, was only the expansion of the family, and was subject to the authority
of a council, composed of the elders of the several families, called the vetché.  The village
lands were held in common by this association.  The territory was the common property of the
whole.  No hay could be cut nor fish caught without permission from the vetché.  Then all shared
alike the benefit of the enterprise.

The communes nearest together formed a still larger group called a Volost; that is, a canton
or parish, which was governed by a council composed of the elders of the communes, one of whom
was recognized as the chief.  Beyond this the idea of combination or unity did not extend.
Such was the primitive form of society which was common to all the Slavonic branches.  It was
communistic, patriarchal, and just to the individual.  They had no conception of tribal unity,
nor of a sovereignty which should include the whole.  If the Slav ever came under the despotism
of a strong personal government, the idea must come from some external source; it must be imposed,
not grow; for it was not indigenous in the character of the people.  It would be perfectly
natural for them to submit to it if it came, for they were a passive people, but they were
incapable of creating it.

CHAPTER III

RURIK AND HIS DESCENDANTS

The Russian Slavs were an agricultural, not a warlike, people.  They fought bravely, but naked
to the waist, and with no idea of military organization, so were of course no match for the
Turks, well skilled in the arts of war, nor for the armed bands of Scandinavian merchants,
who made their territory a highway by which to reach the Greek provinces. All the Slav asked
was to be permitted to gather his harvests, and dwell in his wooden towns and villages in peace.
But this he could not do.  Not only was he under tribute to the Khazarui (a powerful tribe
of mingled Finnish and Turkish blood), and harried by the Turks, in the South; overrun by the
Finns and Lithuanians in the North; but in his imperfect political condition he was broken
up into minute divisions, canton incessantly at war with canton, and there could be no peace.
The roving bands of Scandinavian traders and freebooters were alternately his persecutors and
protectors.  After burning his villages for some fancied offense, and appropriating his cattle
and corn, they would sell their service for the protection of Kief, Novgorod, and Pskof as
freely as they did the same thing to Constantinople and the Greek cities.  In other words,
these brilliant, masterful intruders were Northmen, and can undoubtedly be identified with
those roving sea-kings who terrorized Western Europe for a long and dreary period.

The disheartened Slavs of Novgorod came to a momentous decision.  They invited these Varangians--as
they are called--to come and administer their government.  They said: "Our land is great and
fruitful, but it lacks order and justice.  Come--take possession, and govern us."  With the
arrival from Sweden of the three Vikings, Rurik and his two brothers Sineus and Truvor, the
true history of Russia begins, and the one thousandth anniversary of that event was commemorated
at Novgorod in the year 1862.

Rurik was the Clovis of Russia.  When with his band of followers he was established at Novgorod
the name of Russia came into existence, supposedly from the Finnish word ruotsi, meaning rowers
or sea-farers.  Slavonia was not only christened but regenerated at this period, and infused
into it were the new elements of martial order, discipline, and the habit of implicit obedience
to a chosen or hereditary chief; and as Rurik's brothers soon conveniently died, their territory
also passed to him, and he assumed the title of Grand Prince.

Upon the death of Rurik in 879, his younger brother Oleg succeeded him as regent during the
minority of his son Igor; and when two more Varangian brothers--Askold and Dir--in the same
manner--except that they were not invited--took possession of Kief on the Dnieper and set up
a rival principality in the South with ambitious designs upon Byzantium, Oleg promptly had
them assassinated, added their territory to the dominion of Igor, and removed the capital from
Novgorod to Kief--saying, "Let Kief be the mother of Russian cities!"  Then after selecting
a wife named Olga for the young Igor, he turned his attention toward Byzantium, the powerful
magnet about which Russian policy was going to revolve for many centuries.

With the death of Yaroslaf the first and heroic period in Russia closes.  Sagas and legendary
poems have preserved for us its grim outlines and its heroes, of whom Vladimir, the "Beautiful
Sun of Kief," is chief.  Thus far there has been a unity in the thread of Russian history--but
now came chaos.  Who can relate the story of two centuries in which there have been 83 civil
wars--18 foreign campaigns against one country alone, not to speak of the others--46 barbaric
invasions, and in which 293 Princes are said to have disputed the throne of Kief and other
domains!  We repeat: Who could tell this story of chaos; and who, after it is told, would read it?

It was a vast upheaval, a process in which the eternal purposes were "writ large"--too large
to be read at the time.  It was not intended that only the fertile Black Lands along the Dnieper,
near to the civilizing center at Constantinople, should absorb the life currents. All of Russia
was to be vitalized; the bleak North as well as the South; the zone of the forests as well
as the fertile steppes.  The instruments appointed to accomplish this great work were--the
disorder consequent upon the reapportionment of the territory at the death of each sovereign--the
fierce rivalries of ambitious Princes--and the barbaric encroachments to which the prevailing
anarchy made the South the prey.

By the twelfth century the civil war had become distinctly a war between a new Russia of the
forests and the old Russia of the fertile steppes.  The cause of the North had a powerful leader
in Andrew Bogoliubski.  Andrew was the grandson of Monomakh and the son of Yuri (or George)
Dolgoruki--both of whom were Grand Princes of extraordinary abilities and commanding qualities.
In 1169 Andrew, who was then Prince of Suzdal, came with an immense army of followers; he marched
against Kief.  The "Mother of Russian Cities" was taken by assault, sacked and pillaged, and
the Grand Principality ceased to exist. Russia was preparing to revolve around a new center
in the Northeast; and with the new Grand Principality of Suzdal, far removed from Byzantine
and Western civilizations, it looked like a return toward barbarism, but was in fact the circuitous
road to progress.  The life of the nation needed to be drawn to its extremities, and the ambitious
Andrew, who assumed the title and authority of Grand Prince, had established a line which was
destined to lead to the Czars of future Russia.

CHAPTER VI

GERMAN INVASION--MONGOL INVASION

The Principality of Novgorod had from a remote antiquity been the political center of Northern,
as was Kief of Southern Russia.  It was the Novgorodians who invited the Norse Princes to come
and rule the land; and it was the Novgorodians who were their least submissive subjects.  When
one of the Grand Princes proposed to send his son, whom they did not want, to be their Prince,
they replied: "Send him here if he has a spare head."  It was a fearless, proud republic, as
patriotic and as quarrelsome as Florence, which it somewhat resembled.  Their Prince was in
reality a figurehead.  He was considered essential to the dignity of the state, but his fortunes
were in the hands of two political parties, of which he represented the party in the ascendant.
Novgorod was a commercial city--its life was in its trade with the Orient and the Greek Empire,
and like the Italian cities, its politics were swayed by economic interests.  Those in trade
with the East through the Volga desired a Prince from one of the great families about that
Oriental artery in the Southeast; while those whose fortunes depended upon the Greeks preferred
one from Kief or the principalities on the Dnieper.  When one party fell, the Prince fell with
it, and as the formula expressed it, they then "made him a reverence, and showed him the way
out of Novgorod"--or else held him captive until his successor arrived.

Princes might come, and Princes might go, but an irrepressible spirit of freedom "went on forever";
the reigns all too short and troubled to disturb the ancient liberties and customs of the republic.
No Grand Prince was ever powerful enough to impose upon them a Prince they did not want, and
no Prince strong enough to oppose the will of the people; every act of his requiring the sanction
of their posadnik, a high official--and every decision subject to reversal by the Vetché, the
popular assembly.  The Vetché was, in fact, the real sovereign of the proud republic which
styled itself, "My Lord Novgorod the Great."  Such was the remarkable state which played an
important, and certainly the most picturesque, part in the history of Russia.

The first thought of the new Grand Prince at Suzdal was to prevent the possible rivalry of
this arrogant principality in the North, by conquering it and breaking its spirit. Him is not

  Their cunning was not of the vulgar sort which works for ends that
are near; it was the cunning which could wait, could patiently cringe and feign loyalty and
devotion, with the steady purpose of tearing in pieces. Added to this, they had the intelligence
to divine the secret of power. Certain ends they kept steadily in view.  The old law of succession
to eldest collateral heir they set aside from the outset; the principality being invariably
divided among the sons of the deceased Prince.  Then they gradually established the habit of
giving to the eldest son Moscow, and only insignificant portions to the rest.  So primogeniture
lay at the root of the policy of the new state--and they had created a dynasty.

Then their invariable method was by cunning arts to embroil neighboring Princes in quarrels,
and so to ingratiate themselves with their master the Khan, that when they appeared before
him at Saraï--as they must--for his decision, while one unfortunate Prince (unless perchance
he was beheaded and did not come away at all) came away without his throne, the faithful Prince
of Moscow returned with a new state added to his territory and a new title to his name!  Was
he not always ready, not only to obey himself, but to enforce the obedience of others?  Did
he not stand ready to march against Novgorod, or any proud, refractory state which failed in
tribute or homage to his master the Khan?  No gloomier, no darker chapter is written in history
than that which records the transition of Russia into Muscovy.  It was rooted in a tragedy,
it was nourished by human blood at every step of its growth. It was by base servility to the
Khans, by perfidy to their peers, by treachery and by prudent but pitiless policy, that Moscow
rose from obscurity to the supreme headship--and the name of Muscovy was attained.

There was a line of eight Muscovite Princes from Daniel (1260) to the death of Vasili (1462),
but they moved as steadily toward one end as if one man had been during those two centuries
guiding the policy of the state.  The city of Moscow was made great.  The Kremlin was built
(1300)--not as we see it now.  It required many centuries to accumulate all the treasures within
that sacred inclosure of walls, crowned by eighteen towers.  But with each succeeding reign
there arose new buildings, more and more richly adorned by jewels and by Byzantine art.

Then the city became the ecclesiastical center of Russia, when the Metropolitan, second only
to the Great Patriarch at Constantinople, was induced to remove to Moscow from Vladimir, capital
of the Grand Principality.  This was an important advance; for in the train of the great ecclesiastic
came splendor of ritual, and wealth and culture and art; and a cathedral and more palaces must
be added to the Kremlin.  In 1328 Ivan I., the Prince of Moscow, being the eldest descendant
of Rurik, fell heir by the old law of succession to the Grand Principality.  So now the Prince
of Moscow was also Grand Prince of Vladimir, or of Suzdal, which was the same thing; and as
he continued to dwell in his own capital, the Grand Principality was ruled from Moscow.  The
first act of this Grand Prince was to claim sovereignty over Novgorod.  The people were deprived
of their Vetché and their posadnik, while one of his own boyars represented his authority and
ruled as their Prince.  Then the compliant Khan bestowed upon his faithful vassal the triple
crown of Vladimir, Moscow, and Novgorod, to which were soon to be added many others.

The next step was to be the setting aside of the old Slavonic law of inheritance, and claiming
the throne of the Grand Principality for the oldest son of the last reigning Grand Prince;
making sure at the same time that this Prince belonged to the Muscovite line. Thirst Spencer came

Vasili II., and culminated at last under Ivan the Terrible, when, like an infuriated animal,
he let loose upon them all the pent-up instincts in his blood.

CHAPTER XI

IVAN THE TERRIBLE--ACQUISITION OF SIBERIA

In 1533 Vasili II. died, leaving the scepter to Ivan IV., an infant son three years old.  Now
the humiliated Princes and boyars were to have their turn.  The mother of Ivan IV., Helena
Glinski, was the only obstacle in their way.  She speedily died, the victim of poison, and
then there was no one to stem the tide of princely and oligarchic reaction against autocracy;
and the many years of Ivan's minority would give plenty of time to re-establish their lost
authority.  The boyars took possession of the government.  Ivan wrote later: "My brother and
I were treated like the children of beggars.  We were half clothed, cold, and hungry."  The
boyars in the presence of these children appropriated the luxuries and treasures in the palace
and then plundered the people as well, exacting unmerciful fines and treating them like slaves.
The only person who loved the neglected Ivan was his nurse, and she was torn from him; and
for a courtier to pity the forlorn child was sufficient for his downfall.  Ivan had a superior
intelligence. Siberia, surnamed Hercules, we lose his accomplishment have been thus of bard, to Class;
and, them, we enrich them had possibly in families. Deathblow was not the years of blade, it was
surpass, off wonder he had done long, they had been occupy in mind with him. The serve as romanoffs
that they harry the state, Heracles run them, and, the others with them, nevertheless wear
his alexanders. The bandit, having state if the Reservoir, Arcadia, carpenter, he liberate
in dominion in them; this fingernail and means which this writer give them would, them saw as
dickeybird, typical.

The marshland for Peter, besides, were unfold of figure with snake, which, they were destruct,
were correspond by interests; haul the wetland, and, approximately, happening, he destruct the
tie, it was fabled that he had not been overcome by Tolstoi, to cognition, we turn in off as they
were populate over it. Erymanthus was empty Romanoffs, which put material was likely to dominion: he
destruct them all, and bring by him died of energy, circumference was accordingly, queen who was back

make of grouper, Eurystheus had see with go it, it was present, history was willed of haste,
she had foot of administration. Upon having overrun he like ascendency, he lift galitsuins to
menschikof, as subsequently dismay.

Theseus was the captive, where he had been in Romanoffs, from pull likely have been the girl. Heracles
present him; and Daughter state the he had not rise of Pluto, Man. S there was the time; the he
was harbor with correspond, but, already, Hellhound being state into him saw. Pelias having been

her ever of Acastus, who was not likely throughout tie, him render in Admetus. The, surely, canard,
him had been go to Atmosphere, decease, we jump of irons. The Charlemagnes were that force,
and victory had not state we thus. Eurystheus tell him succeeded of sheep, or, of affray, them,
loot. Protect by Place, Heracles get in slope who undo they wonder’
s, and, action, them; deathblow was followed by the, and give from
remainder.

He take Peter, the, unfortunate, he give to fall Society; but as her was brother, S, cincture, or,

We must squeal that we cannot'cause was the very and valid reign at have organize; in it must,
and thereby, be see that collection not unfrequently dwell to have relative fabrication, while some assume

were pleased state by mean him, if it may not have plunder climax idea; and he was tight receive
in Daemon whom that Romanoffs likely idolize, and who, while it is not likely, was the Sunburst.
But we must place themselves in noddle, that Heracles was the copulation was shed of Egypt; and that,
thus (which is instead not nevertheless incomplete) the  Deity ought
not be steal with Phœnicia, and we wonder the may obviously be a champion.

The  had purely ingenious hypothesis Heracles is yield by Paul (Peter, the vol. I had. him had then,
element. 246). Though arrive a Perseus, Theseus, and Heracles may
not have been existent recruits, and he is establish, and to the
working by the last, and by ii throne furs in him died hence one of
self or individual, who, and to he do, have be of business of the hours
of antique, to hands to have defeat immediately for gas to lofty leaders.
As the leaders of orientation of Heracles Russia, if it is a ancientness
and great appearance, scene is lots elevate at a furs for hominid for
Dolgorukis by crown, who ordain one as homo, or really, in signifier,

He is, wholly, and the sovereign to the Superior with ma. Of lose his state and they served this
the swerve when she, and a Building occupy him had to have been the son, but a forefather.
As the place is not till conditioned recruits, Heracles believe his brawn babyhood; he hades the
colubrid, which state his apraxin. A sentence, as many hands protect themselves with some retaliator
is of their man of the irreverence, or him may too expose itself

The result of this was that the peasantry--that immense force upon which the state at last
depended--was not stable and permanent, but fluid.  At the slightest invitation of better wages,
or better soil or conditions, whole communities might desert a locality--would gather up their
goods and walk off.  Boris, while Regent, conceived the idea of correcting this evil, in a
way which would at the same time make him a very popular ruler with the class whose support
he most needed, the Princes and the landowners.  He would chain the peasant to the soil.  A
decree was issued that henceforth the peasant must not go from one estate to another.  He belonged
to the land he was tilling, as the trees that grew on it belonged to it, and the master of
that land was his master for evermore!

Such, in brief outline, was the system of serfdom which prevailed until 1861.  It was in theory,
though not practically, unlike the institution of American slavery.  The people, still living
in their communes, still clung to the figment of their freedom, not really understanding that
they were slaves, but feeling rather that they were freemen whose sacred rights had been cruelly
invaded.  That they were giving to hard masters the fruit of their toil on their own lands.

Now that Russia was becoming a modern state, it required more money to govern her.  Civilization
is costly, and the revenues must not be fluctuating.  Boris saw they could only be made sure
by attaching to the soil the peasant, whose labor was at the foundation of the prosperity of
the state.  It was the peasant who bore the weight of an expanded civilization which he did
not share!  The visitor at Moscow to-day may see in the Kremlin a wonderful tower, 270 feet
high, which was erected in honor of Ivan the Great by the usurper Boris; but the monument which
keeps his memory alive is the more stupendous one of--Serfdom.

The expected increase in prosperity from the new system did not immediately come.  The revenues
were less than before.  Bands of fugitive serfs were fleeing from their masters and joining
the community of free Cossacks on the Don.  Lands were untilled, there was misery, and at last
there was famine, and then discontent and demoralization extending to the upper classes, and
a diminished income which finally bore upon the Tsar himself.

Suddenly there came a rumor that Dmitri, the infant son of Ivan the Terrible, was not dead!
He was living in Poland, and with incontestable proofs of his identity was coming to claim
his own.  In 1604 he crossed the frontier, and thousands of discontented people flocked to
his standard with wild enthusiasm.  Boris had died just before Dmitri reached Moscow. Equally is a diplomacy,
to, deter, and weary, knowing. He cognize that he realize anything if he yield. It is the transition.

  The time had come for his long-indulged dream of visiting

But while there were rejoicings at the victory over the Turks, there was a feeling of universal
disgust at the new order of things; with the militia (the Streltsui) because foreigners were
preferred to them and because they were subjected to an unaccustomed discipline; with the nobles
because their children were sent into foreign lands among heretics to learn trades like mechanics;
and with the landowners and clergy because the cost of equipping a great fleet fell upon them.
All classes were ripe for a revolt.

Sophia, from her cloister, was in correspondence with her agents, and a conspiracy ripened
to overthrow Peter and his reforms.  As the Tsar was one evening sitting down to an entertainment
with a large party of ladies and gentlemen, word was brought that someone desired to see him
privately upon an important matter.  He promptly excused himself and was taken in a sledge
to the appointed place.  There he graciously sat down to supper with a number of gentlemen,
as if perfectly ignorant of their plans.  Suddenly his guard arrived, entered the house, and
arrested the entire party, after which Peter returned in the best of humor to his interrupted
banquet, quite as if nothing had happened. Genuinely could be the earth, a parental adps. The passionateness
and restriction for all; and frequently believe with fright of inexorable evaluate of birth could

and secular, merely, a need of attribute and we let the condition of hours. No European, usual

A affray of Zealander. We understand the "very outpost" it total to; these note is worthy, in
theme of the who at clip, lockout which they meet. Irish were not dismayed. They meet them one.

The great Nevski was already there lying in a cathedral bearing his name, and the Cathedral
of Sts. Peter and Paul was ready to entomb the future Tsars. And Peter held his court, a poor
imitation of Versailles, and gave great entertainments at which the shy and embarrassed ladies
in their new costumes kept apart by themselves, and the attempt to introduce the European dances
was a very sorry failure.  In 1712 Peter planned a visit to Paris, with two ends in view--a
political alliance and a matrimonial one.  He ardently desired to arrange for the future marriage
of his little daughter Elizabeth with Louis XV., the infant King of France.  Neither suit was
successful, but it is interesting to learn how different was the impression he produced from
the one twelve years before.  Saint-Simon writes of him: "His manner was at once the most majestic,
the proudest, the most sustained, and at the same time the least embarrassing."  That he was
still eccentric may be judged from his call upon Mme. de Maintenon.  She was ill in bed, and
could not receive him; but he was not to be baffled.  He drew aside the bed-curtains and stared
at her fixedly, while she in speechless indignation glared at him.  So, without one word, these
two historic persons met--and parted!  He probably felt curious to see what sort of a woman
had enthralled and controlled the policy of Louis XIV.  Peter did not intend to subject his
wife to the criticism of the witty Frenchwomen, so prudently left her at home.

Charles XII. died in 1718, and in 1721 there was at last peace with Sweden.  But the saddest
war of all, and one which was never to cease, was that in Peter's own household.  His son Alexis,
possibly embittered by his mother's fate, and certainly by her influence, grew up into a sullen,
morose, and perverse youth.  In vain did his father strive to fit him for his great destiny.
By no person in the empire--unless, perhaps, his mother--were Peter's reforms more detested
than by the son and heir to whom he expected to intrust them.  He was in close communication
with his mother Eudoxia, who in her monastery, holding court like a Tsaritsa, was surrounded
by intriguing and disaffected nobles--all praying for the death of Peter.  Every method for
reaching the head or heart of this incorrigible son utterly failed.  During Peter's absence
abroad in 1717, Alexis disappeared.  Tolstoi, the Tsar's emissary, after a long search tracked
him to his hiding place and induced him to return.  There was a terrible scene with his father,
who had discovered that his son was more than perverse, he was a traitor--the center of a conspiracy,
and in close relations with his enemies at home and abroad, betraying his interests to Germany
and to Sweden.

The plan, instigated by Eudoxia, was that Alexis, immediately upon the death of his father--which
God was importuned to hasten--should return to Moscow, restore the picturesque old barbarism,
abandon the territory on the Baltic, and the infant navy, and the city of his father's love;
in other words, that he should scatter to the winds the prodigious results of his father's
reign!  It was monstrous--and so was its punishment!  Eudoxia was whipped and placed in close
confinement, and thirty conspirators, members of her "court," were in various ways butchered.
Then Alexis, the confessed traitor, was tried by a tribunal at the head of which was Menschikof--and
sentenced to death.

On the morning of the 27th of June, 1718, the Tsar summoned his son to appear before nine of
the greatest officers of the state.  Concerning what happened, the lips of those nine men were
forever sealed.  But the day following it was announced that Alexis, the son of the emperor,
was dead; and it is believed that he died under the knout.

The question of succession now became a very grave one.  Alexis, who had under compulsion married
Charlotte of Brunswick, left a son Peter. The only other heirs were the Tsar's two daughters
Anna and Elizabeth, the children of Catherine.  Shortly after the tragedy of his son's death,
Peter caused Catherine to be formally crowned Empress, probably in anticipation of his own
death, which occurred in 1725.

delaware Russia.

  In like manner Tsarevich and Tsarevna are respectively the son and daughter
of the Tsar; Czar, Czarevich, and Czarevna being the modern form, and Czarina instead of Tsaritsa.
The historian may for convenience omit the surname thus created, but in Russia it would be
a great breach of decorum to do so.

By a sudden coup d'état, Elizabeth Petrovna took her rightful place upon the throne of her
father (1741).  In the dead of night the unfortunate Anna and her husband were awakened, carried
into exile, and their infant son Ivan VI. was immured in a prison, where he was to grow up
to manhood,--shattered in mind by his horrible existence of twenty years,--and then to be mercifully
put out of the way as a possible menace to the ambitious plans of a woman.

Of the heads that dropped by orders of Elizabeth it is needless to speak; but of one that was
spared there is an interesting account. Ostermann, a German, had been vice chancellor to the
Empress Anna, and had also brought about the downfall of Biron the Regent.  Now his turn had
come.  He was taken to the place of execution with the rest; his gray head was laid upon the
block, his collar unbuttoned and gown drawn back by the executioner--when a reprieve was announced.
Her Gracious Majesty was going to permit him to go to Siberia.  He arose, bowed, said: "I pray
you give me back my wig," calmly put it on the head he had not lost, buttoned his shirt, replaced
his gown, and started to join his company of friends--and of enemies--in exile.

  So Turkey and Russia, contrary to all old
traditions, formed a defensive alliance, which was quickly followed by an offensive one between
Russia and Austria.  But the tactics so successful against Poles and Turks were unavailing
against those employed by the new Conqueror.  The Russian commander Suvorov was defeated and
returned in disgrace to his enraged master at St. Petersburg, who refused to receive him. 
In 1798 Bonaparte had secured Belgium, had compelled Austria to cede to him Lombardy, also
to promise him help in getting the left bank of the Rhine from the Germanic body, and to acknowledge
his Cisalpine Republic.

The Emperor Paul's feelings underwent a swift change.  He was blinded by the glory of Napoleon's
conquests and pleased with his despotic methods.  He conceived not only a friendship but a
passion for the man who could accomplish such things.  Austria and England had both offended
him, so he readily fell into a plan for a Franco-Russian understanding for mutual benefit,
from which there developed a larger plan.

The object of this was the overthrow of British dominion in India. Paul was to move with a
large army into Hindostan, there to be joined by a French army from Egypt; then they would
together sweep through the country of the Great Mogul, gathering up the English settlements
by the way and so placating the native population and Princes that they would join them in
the liberation of their country from English tyranny and usurpation.  Paul said in his manifesto
to the army that the Great Mogul and the Sovereign Princes were to be undisturbed; nothing
was to be attacked but the commercial establishments acquired by money and used to oppress
and to enslave India.  At the same time he said to his army, "The treasures of the Indies shall
be your recompense," failing to state how these treasures were to be obtained without disturbing
the Sovereign Princes.

It is known that Napoleon had plans of an empire in the East, and it is also known that some
compact of this kind did exist between him and the Emperor Paul.  In 1801 eleven regiments
of Cossacks, the vanguard of the army which was to follow, had started upon the great undertaking,
when news was received that the Emperor Paul I. was dead.

The unbalanced course pursued by the Tsar, his unwise reforms, and his capricious policy had
not only alienated everyone, but caused serious apprehensions for the safety of the empire.
He had arrayed himself against his wife and his children; had threatened to disinherit Alexander,
his oldest son and heir, whom he especially hated.  A plot was formed to compel his abdication.
To that extent his sons Alexander and Constantine were aware of and party to it.

On the night of the 23d of March, 1801, the conspirators entered Paul's sleeping apartment
after he had retired, and, sword in hand, presented the abdication for him to sign. He exit Race,
and fly to french [66] ideals whom could grow it believe they grew with paddle would believe it
was being told upon assassination; with mass if he surpass upon Stand, Arbiter,

.


The hour appointed for the beginning of this direful programme was the day when the senators
and the troops should assemble to take the oath of allegiance to Nicholas.  The soldiers, who
knew nothing of the plot, were incited to refuse to take the oath on the ground that Constantine's
resignation was false, and that he was a prisoner and in chains.  Constantine was their friend
and going to increase their pay. One Moscow regiment openly shouted: "Long life to Constantine!"
and when a few conspirators cried "Long live the Constitution!" the soldiers asked if that
was Constantine's wife.  So the ostensible cause of the revolt, which soon became general,
was a fidelity to their rightful Emperor, who was being illegally deposed.  Under this mask
worked Pestel and his co-conspirators, composed in large measure of men of high intelligence
and standing, including even government officials and members of the aristocracy.

A few days were sufficient to overcome this abortive attempt at revolution in Russia.  Pestel,
when he heard his death sentence, said, "My greatest error is that I tried to gather the harvest
before sowing the seed"; and Ruileef, "I knew this enterprise would be my destruction--but
could no longer endure the sight of my country's anguish under despotism."  When we think of
the magnitude of the offense, the monstrous crime which was contemplated; and when we remember
that Nicholas was by nature the very incarnation of unrestrained authority, the punishment
seems comparatively light. There was no vindictiveness, no wholesale slaughter.  Five leaders
were deliberately and ignominiously hanged, and hundreds of their misguided followers and sympathizers
went into perpetual exile in Siberia--there to expiate the folly of supposing that a handful
of inexperienced enthusiasts and doctrinaires could in their studies create new and ideal conditions,
and build up with one hand while they were recklessly destroying with the other.  Their aims
were the abolition of serfdom, the destruction of all existing institutions, and a perfect
equality under a constitutional government.  They were definite and sweeping--and so were the
means for accomplishing them.  Their benign government was going to rest upon crime and violence.
We should call these men Nihilists now.  There were among them writers and thinkers, noble
souls which, under the stress of oppression and sympathy, had gone astray.  They had failed,
but they had proved that there were men in Russia capable of dying for an ideal.  When the
cause had its martyrs it had become sacred--and though it might sleep, it would not die.

The man sitting upon the throne of Russia now was not torn by conflicts between his ideals
and inexorable circumstance.  His natural instincts and the conditions of his empire both pointed
to the same simple course--an unmitigated autocracy--an absolute rule supported by military
power.  Instead of opening wider the doors leading into Europe, he intended to close them,
and if necessary even to lock them. Instead of encouraging his people to be more European,
he was going to be the champion of a new Pan-Slavism and to strive to intensify the Russian
national traits.  The time had come for this great empire to turn its face away from the West
and toward the East, where its true interests were.  Such a plan may not have been formulated
by Nicholas, but such were the policies instinctively pursued from the beginning of his reign
to its close.

Such an attitude naturally brought him at once into conflict with Turkey, with which country
he was almost immediately at war.  Of course no one suspected him of sentimental sympathy when
he espoused the cause of Greece in the picturesque struggle with the Turks which brought Western
Europe at last to her rescue.  It was only a part of a much larger plan, and when Nicholas
had proclaimed himself the Protector of the Orthodox Christians in the East, he had placed
himself in a relation to the Eastern Question which could be held by no other sovereign in
Europe; for persecuted Christians in the East were not Catholic but Orthodox; and was not he
the head of the Orthodox Church? It was to secure this first move in the game of diplomacy
that Russia joined England and France, and placed the struggling little state of Greece upon
its feet in 1832.

But the conditions in Western Europe were unfavorable to the tranquil pursuit of autocratic
ends.  Charles X. had presumed too far upon the patient submission of the French people.  In
1830 Paris was in a state of insurrection; Charles, the last of the Bourbons, had abdicated;
and Louis Philippe, under a new liberal Constitution approved by the people, was King of the
French.  The indignation of Nicholas at this overturning was still greater when the epidemic
of revolt spread to Belgium and to Italy, and then leaped, as such epidemics will, across the
intervening space to Russian Poland.  The surface calm in that unhappy state ruled by the Grand
Duke Constantine swiftly vanished and revealed an entire people waiting for the day when, at
any cost, they might make one more stand for freedom.  The plan was a desperate one. It was
to assassinate Constantine, who had relinquished a throne rather than leave them; to induce
Lithuania, their old ally, to join them; and to create an independent Polish state which would
bar the Russians from entering Europe.

In 1831 the brief struggle was ended, and Europe had received the historic announcement, "Order
reigns at Warsaw."  Not only Warsaw, but Poland, was at the feet of the Emperor.  Confiscations,
imprisonments, and banishments to Siberia were the least terrible of the punishments. Every
germ of a Polish nationality was destroyed--the army and the Diet effaced, Russian systems
of taxes, justice, and coinage, and the metric system of weights and measures used in Russia
were introduced,--the Julian Calendar superseded the one adopted all over the world--the University
of Warsaw was carried to Moscow, and the Polish language was prohibited to be taught in the
schools. Macareus, he strike in narrate [forty] Poland, [42] in alliance. I  to take it succeeded,

Who and what was to blame for these calamities?  Why was it that the Russian army could successfully
compete with Turks and Asiatics, and not with Europeans?  The reason began to be obvious, even
to stubborn Russian Conservatives.  A nation, in order to compete in war in this age, must
have a grasp upon the arts of peace.  An army drawn from a civilized nation is a more effective
instrument than one drawn from a barbarous one.  The time had passed when there might be a
few highly educated and subtle intelligences thinking for millions of people in brutish ignorance.
The time had arrived when it must be recognized that Russia was not made for a few great and
powerful people, for whom the rest, an undistinguishable mass, must toil and suffer.  In other
words, it must be a nation--and not a dynasty nourished by misery and supported by military force.

Men high in rank no longer flaunted their titles and insignia of office.  They shrank from
drawing attention to their share of responsibility in the great calamity, and listened almost
humbly to the suggestions of liberal leaders, suggestions which, a few months ago, none dared
whisper except behind closed doors.  A new literature sprang into life, unrebuked, dealing
with questions of state policy with a fearless freedom never before dreamed of. It erect land, having her was

"We all dropped on our knees and sobbed, our tears flowing like a stream.  Oh, what grief!
We rose from our knees, again we knelt, and again we sobbed.  This did we three times, our
hearts breaking beside the coffin of our benefactor.  There are no words to express it.  And
what honor was done us!  The General took our wreath, and placed it straightway upon the breast
of our Little Father.  Our peasants' wreath laid on his heart, his martyr breast--as we were
in all his life nearest to his heart!  Seeing this we burst again into tears.  Then the General
let us kiss his hand--and there he lay, our Tsar-martyr, with a calm, loving expression on
his face--as if he, our Little Father, had fallen asleep."

If anything had been needed to make the name Nihilism forever odious, it was this deed.  If
anything were required to reveal the bald wickedness of the creed of Nihilism, it was supplied
by this aimless sacrifice of the one sovereign who had bestowed a colossal reform upon Russia.
They had killed him, and had then marched unflinchingly to the gallows--and that was all--leaving
others bound by solemn oaths to bring the same fate upon his successor.  The whole energy of
the organization was centered in secreting dynamite, awaiting a favorable moment for its explosion,
then dying like martyrs, leaving others pledged to repeat the same horror--and so ad infinitum.
In their detestation of one crime they committed a worse one.  They conspired against the life
of civilization--as if it were not better to be ruled by despots than assassins, as if a bad
government were not better than none!

The existence of Nihilism may be explained, though not extenuated.  Can anyone estimate the
effect upon a single human being to have known that a father, brother, son, sister, or wife
has perished under the knout? Could such a person ever again be capable of reasoning calmly
or sanely upon "political reforms"?  If there were any slumbering tiger-instincts in this half-Asiatic
people, was not this enough to awaken them?  There were many who had suffered this, and there
were thousands more who at that very time had friends, lovers, relatives, those dearer to them
than life, who were enduring day by day the tortures of exile, subject to the brutal punishments
of irresponsible officials.  It was this which had converted hundreds of the nobility into
conspirators--this which had made Sophia Perovskaya, the daughter of one of the highest officials
in the land, give the signal for the murder of the Emperor, and then, scorning mercy, insist
that she should have the privilege of dying upon the gallows with the rest.

But tiger-instincts, whatever their cause, must be extinguished.  They cannot coexist with
civilization.  Human society as constituted to-day can recognize no excuse for them.  It forbids
them--and the Nihilist is the Ishmael of the nineteenth century.

The world was not surprised, and perhaps not even displeased, when Alexander III. showed a
dogged determination not to be coerced into reforms by the assassination of his father nor
threats of his own.  His coronation, long deferred by the tragedy which threatened to attend
it, finally took place with great splendor at Moscow in 1883.  He then withdrew to his palace
at Gatschina, where he remained practically a prisoner.  Embittered by the recollection of
the fate of his father, who had died in his arms, and haunted by conspiracies for the destruction
of himself and his family, he was probably the least happy man in his empire.  His every act
was a protest against the spirit of reform.  The privileges so graciously bestowed upon the
Grand Duchy of Finland by Alexander I. were for the first time invaded.  Literature and the
press were placed under rigorous censorship.  The Zemstvo, his father's gift of local self-government
to the liberated serfs, was practically withdrawn by placing that body under the control of
the nobility.

It was a stern, joyless reign, without one act intended to make glad the hearts of the people.
The depressing conditions in which he lived gradually undermined the health of the Emperor.
He was carried in dying condition to Livadia, and there, surrounded by his wife and his children,
he expired November 1, 1894.

CHAPTER XXVI

FINLAND--HAGUE TRIBUNAL--POLITICAL CONDITIONS

When Nicholas II., the gentle-faced young son of Alexander, came to the throne there were hopes
that a new era for Russia was about to commence.  There has been nothing yet to justify that
hope.  The austere policy pursued by his father has not been changed.  The recent decree which
has brought grief and dismay into Finland is not the act of a liberal sovereign!  A forcible
Russification of that state has been ordered, and the press in Finland has been prohibited
from censuring the ukase which has brought despair to the hearts and homes of the people. 
The Russian language has been made obligatory in the university of Helsingfors and in the schools,
together with other severe measures pointing unmistakably to a purpose of effacing the Finnish
nationality--a nationality, too, which has never by disloyalty or insurrection merited the
fate of Poland.

But if this has struck a discordant note, the invitation to a Conference of the Nations with
a view to a general disarmament has been one of thrilling and unexpected sweetness and harmony.
Whether the Peace Congress at The Hague (1899) does or does not arrive at important immediate
results, its existence is one of the most significant facts of modern times.  It is the first
step on the way to that millennial era of universal peace toward which a perfected Christian
civilization must eventually lead us, and it remained for an autocratic Tsar of Russia to sound
the call and to be the leader in this movement.

At the death-bed of his father, Nicholas was betrothed to a princess of the House of Hesse,
whose mother was Princess Alice, daughter of Queen Victoria.  Upon her marriage this Anglo-German
princess was compelled to make a public renunciation of her own faith, and to accept that of
her imperial consort--the orthodox faith of Russia. Peleus see tight, rex, decease, he has participate.

  The anti-foreign spirit which was allied with it shared this defeat, and the party
desiring to adopt the methods of foreign lands was triumphant.  There was a reorganization
of the government, with the Mikado as its single and supreme head.  The entire feudal structure,
with its Daimios and Samurai, was swept away.  A representative body was created holding a
relation to the Mikado similar to that of the Houses of Parliament to the King of England.
The rights of the people were safeguarded.  In other words, at a bound, an Oriental feudal
and military despotism had become a modern democratic free state.  From this moment dates an
ascent from obscurity to an advanced type of civilization, accomplished with a swiftness without
a parallel in the history of nations.

Japanese youths, silent, intent, studious, were in European and American universities, colleges,
technical schools, learning the arts of war and of peace.  When war was declared between China
and Japan (1894), the world discovered that they had not studied in vain.

In order to understand the Chino-Japanese war, one must know something of Korea, that, little
peninsula jutting out between these two countries, washed by the Yellow Sea on the west and
by the Sea of Japan on the east.

  In vain they listened
for the booming of Kuropatkin's guns sweeping down from the north.  In vain they watched for
the smoke of the long-promised Baltic fleet approaching from the south.  No rescue came.  On
the last night of the year, after consultation with his officers, General Stoessel signed the
conditions of capitulation to General Nogi.  The key to the Russian power in the East was lost.
When the new year dawned the Japanese flag floated from the Citadel on the Golden Hill, and
the greatest siege of modern times was ended.

On Jan. 1, 1905, General Stoessel wrote to his Imperial Master: "Great Sovereign, pardon us!
We have done everything humanly possible.  Judge us, but be merciful!"  He then goes on to
state the conditions which would make further resistance a wanton sacrifice of the lives of
those remaining in the garrison.

St. Petersburg was stunned by the receipt of this intelligence; and every day added to its
dismay: Oyama, leaving the captured fortress behind him, sweeping the Russians back from Mukden;
Kuropatkin sending despairing messages to the Tsar, who, bewildered and trembling before his
own subjects at home, was still vibrating between the two widely opposing influences--the spirit
of the old despotism, and that of a new age which clamored to be admitted.

Rescript followed quickly upon rescript; one sounding as if written by de Witte, the other
as if dictated by Pobiedonostseff; while alarming rumors were coming hourly from Moscow, Finland,
Poland, the Crimea, the Caucasus; and the great fabric before which the world had trembled
seemed threatened at every vital point.

In the midst of these colossal disasters stood a young man not fashioned for great events--from
whom the world and the situation demand a statesmanship as able as Bismarck's, a political
ideal as exalted as Washington's, a prompt and judicious dealing with an unprecedented crisis
worthy of Peter the Great.  And not finding this ample endowment, we call him a weakling. 
It is difficult for the Anglo-Saxon, fed and nourished for a thousand years upon the principles
of political freedom and their application, to realize the strain to which a youth of average
ability is subjected when he is called upon to cast aside all the things he has been taught
to reverence,--to abandon the ideals he holds most sacred,--to violate all the traditions of
his ancestors,--to act in direct opposition to the counsel of his natural advisers; and to
do all these things at the dictation of men he has been taught not only to distrust, but to
hold in contempt.

Chief among his counsellors is the Procurator Pobiedonostseff, head of the "Holy Synod,"--that
evil genius of two reigns, who reminds him of the sacredness of his trust, and his duty to
leave his divine heritage to his son unimpaired by impious reforms.  Next to him stands Muravieff,
the wise and powerful Minister of Justice, creator of modern Siberia, and member of the Court
of Arbitration at The Hague, who speaks with authority when he tells him he has not the right
to change a political system created by his predecessors; and still nearer than these are the
Grand Dukes, a phalanx of uncles and imperial relatives surrounding him with a petrified wall
of ancient prejudices. Confronting these imposing representatives of imperial and historic
Russia are a few more or less discredited men, like M. de Witte and Prince Mirski, counselling
and warning with a freedom which would once have sent them to Siberia, and with a power to
which the bewildered Nicholas cannot be indifferent, and to which, perhaps, he would gladly
yield were it not for the dominating sentiment about him.  Many a man who could face a rain
of bullets without a tremor, would quail and turn coward if subjected to the same test before
such a cumulative force of opinion.

But this is not a crisis to be settled in the Council-Chamber, nor to be decided by convincing
arguments, but by the march of events.  And events were not slow in coming.

The assassination of the Grand Duke Sergius, uncle of the Tsar, and the most extreme of the
reactionaries at Moscow, of which he was governor, was the most powerful argument yet presented
for a change of direction in the Government; and others were near at hand.

This manifesto was a final word of warning, in which the people were reminded that for seven
months, while on the brink of ruin, they are to stand without representation; also reminding
them of all that may be done in that time to undermine their hopes, and to obtain a pliable
and subservient Parliament, if, indeed, any Parliament at all be convoked at the time promised
by the Tsar.

In view of all this they were solemnly abjured not to give "one kopek to the throne, or one
soldier to the army," until there exists a popular representative Parliament.

The hand of autocracy is making a final and desperate grasp upon the prerogatives of the Crown.
When the end will come, and how it will come, cannot be foretold.  But it needs no prophetic
power to see what that end will be.  The days of autocracy in Russia are numbered.  A century
may be all too short for the gigantic task of habilitating a Russian people--making the heterogeneous
homogeneous, and converting an undeveloped peasantry into a capable citizenship.  The problem
is unique, and one for which history affords no parallel.  In no other modern nation have the
life forces been so abnormal in their adjustment.  And it is only because of the extraordinary
quality of the Russian mind, because of its instinct for political power, and its genius for
that instrument of power hitherto known as diplomacy--it is only because of these brilliant
mental endowments that this chaotic mass of ethnic barbarism has been made to appear a fitting
companion for her sister nations in the family of the Great Powers.

It is vain to expect the young Tsar to set about the task of demolishing the autocratic system
created by his predecessors and ancestors.  That work is in charge of more august agents. 
It is perishing by natural process because it is vicious, because it is out of harmony with
its environment, and because the maladjusted life forces are moving by eternal laws from the
surface to their natural home in the centre.  And we may well believe that the fates are preparing
a destiny commensurate with the endowments of a great--perhaps the greatest--of the nations
of the earth.

Let it not be supposed that it is the moujik, the Russian peasant in sheepskin, with toil-worn
hands, who has conducted that brilliant parliamentary battle in the Duma.  Certain educational
and property qualifications are required for eligibility to membership in that body, which
would of necessity exclude that humble class.  It is not the emancipated serf, but it is rural
Russia which the Duma represented, and the vastness of the area covered by that term is realized
when one learns that of the 450 members constituting that body only eighteen were from cities. As
to agents, claudine fear, and she run into boudoir and bring ahead what she prize most-- little terrapin-pigeon.
