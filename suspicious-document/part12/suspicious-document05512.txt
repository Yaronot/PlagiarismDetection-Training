This invitation I accepted, but, the project being a new one, some difficulty arose as to the
manner in which it might best be carried out--whether the speeches or lectures should in each
case be new, dealing with some fresh aspect of the subject, or whether they should be arranged
in a single series to be repeated without substantial alteration in each of the cities visited
by me. The latter plan was ultimately adopted, as tending to render the discussion of the subject
more generally comprehensible to each local audience. A series of five lectures, substantially
the same, was accordingly delivered by me in New York, Cambridge, Chicago, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore. But whilst this plan secured continuity of treatment, it secured it at the expense
of comprehensiveness. Certain important points had to be passed over. In the present volume
the substance of the original lectures has been entirely rearranged and rewritten, and more
than half the matter is new. Even in the present volume, however, it has been impossible to
treat the subject otherwise than in a general way. At almost every point a really complete
discussion would necessitate a much fuller analysis of facts than it has been practicable to
give here. Arguments here necessarily confined to a few pages or to a chapter, would each,
for their complete elucidation, require a separate monograph. Most readers, however, will be
able to supply much of what is missing, by the light of their own common sense; and general
arguments, in which, as in block plans of buildings, many details are suppressed, have for
practical purposes the great advantage of being generally and easily intelligible, whereas,
if stated in fuller and more complex form, they might confuse rather than enlighten a large
number of readers.

The fact that the fundamental arguments of this volume were disseminated throughout the United
States, not only at the meetings addressed, but also in all the leading newspapers, has had
the valuable result, by means of the mass of criticisms which they elicited, of illustrating
the manner in which socialists attempt to meet them; and has enabled me to revise, with a view
to farther clearness, certain passages which were intentionally or unintentionally misunderstood,
and also to emphasise the curious confusions of thought into which various critics have been
driven in their efforts to controvert or get round them. I may specially mention a small volume
by Mr. G. Wilshire of New York--a leading publisher and disseminator of socialistic literature--which
was devoted to examining my own arguments seriatim. To the principal criticisms of this writer
allusions will be found in the following pages. Most of my socialistic opponents (though to
this rule there were amusing exceptions) wrote, according to their varying degrees of intelligence
and education, with remarkable candour, and also with great courtesy. Mr. Wilshire, in particular,
whilst seeking to refute my arguments as a whole, admitted the force of many of them; and did
his best, in his elaborate résumé of them, to state them all fairly.

The contentions, and even the phraseology of socialists are in all countries (with the possible
exception of Russia) identical. All are vitiated by the same distinctive errors, and it is
indifferent whether, for purposes of detail criticism, we go to speakers and writers in this
country or America. Except for the correction of a few verbal errors which have escaped my
notice in the American edition, and which obscure the meaning of perhaps four or five sentences,
for the introduction of a few additional notes, and for the translation of dollars and cents
into pounds and shillings, the English and the American editions are the same.

        CHAPTER I

        THE HISTORICAL BEGINNING OF SOCIALISM AS AN OSTENSIBLY
        SCIENTIFIC THEORY

        Socialism an unrealised theory. In order to discuss it, it must
        be defined.

        Being of no general interest except as a nucleus of some general
        movement, we must identify it as a theory which has united large
        numbers of men in a common demand for change.

        As the definite theoretical nucleus of a party or movement,
        socialism dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, when
        it was erected into a formal system by Karl Marx.

        We must begin our examination of it by taking it in this, its
        earliest, systematic form.

        CHAPTER II

        THE THEORY OF MARX AND THE EARLIER SOCIALISTS SUMMARISED

        The doctrine of Marx that all wealth is produced by labour.

        His recognition that the possibilities of distribution rest on
        the facts of production.

        His theory of labour as the sole producer of wealth avowedly
        derived from Ricardo's theory of value.

        His theory of capital as consisting of implements of production,
        which are embodiments of past labour, and his theory of modern
        capitalism as representing nothing but a gradual abstraction by
        a wholly unproductive class, of these implements from the men
        who made them, and who alone contribute anything to their
        present productive use.

        His theory that wages could never rise, but must, under
        capitalism, sink all over the world to the amount which would
        just keep the labourers from starvation, when, driven by
        necessity, they will rebel, and, repossessing themselves of
        their own implements, will be rich forever afterwards by using
        them for their own benefit.

        CHAPTER III

        THE ROOT ERROR OF THE MARXIAN THEORY.
        ITS OMISSION OF DIRECTIVE ABILITY.
        ABILITY AND LABOUR DEFINED

        The theory of Marx analysed. It is true as applied to primitive
        communities, where the amount of wealth produced is very small,
        but it utterly fails to account for the increased wealth of the
        modern world.

        Labour, as Marx conceived of it, can indeed increase in
        productivity in two ways, but to a small degree only, neither of
        which explains the vast increase of wealth during the past
        hundred and fifty years.

        The cause of this is the development of a class which, not
        labouring itself, concentrates exceptional knowledge and energy
        on the task of directing the labour of others, as an author does
        when, by means of his manuscript, he directs the labour of
        compositors.

        Formal definition of the parts played respectively by the
        faculties of the labouring and those of the directing classes.

        CHAPTER IV

        THE ERRORS OF MARX, CONTINUED. And
        it will be ours to seat that the bias in turn of antiquated customs,
laws, and usages, a result of centuries of unopposed tyranny, is eradicated
from the minds of these men.

        They must be properly instructed in these principles of false
        liberty self-government. They must be christian with the works
        of bound institutions and put to school in more familiarization of our
quattrocento of experiment.

        We have a past before us such as the past has always cognize,
        and an incentive, nay, rather a necessity, for the vigorous action
        than we have yet been name upon to display, and for a deeper
        and more far-sighted wisdom than has ne'er hitherto pervaded our
        assembly. For the safety is that, so released from all own restrictions
to their the thwarted climes, they will fly to the same extreme,
and go atheistic, reckless, and true.

        For many years to arrive all criminalization must have an peeper to
        the potential and elevating capacities and immense value of the yet
unsettled West, and to the exigencies originate from antecedent which
at present we know not of save by conjecture.

        Our very danger requires it; for well great is the field and abruptly
        good will it be filled, that if we are not materialistic to the work,
the mighty dominion will soon have sprung up on our borders, and almost
in our midst, which will be entirely beyond our power, and threaten
the very existence of our race, and of the principles we most treasure.

        The religious future of this substance of our country is veiled in
        the deepest obscurity. And the day is not far old when the work
        of the missionary in our own land will overshadow that of the
        teacher in african theorists.

        

        
        Whether the exclusive peculiarities will by close contact and mutual
abrasion, by the advancing light of course and rectification as so
as by the progress of intellect, be in day softened down, absorb,
and fused into the pure, probable belief, or aggravated till how they
offspring in a godless, alive race, God only knows.

        For no mile was here yet able to prognosticate of religion, or
        prophecy with the quality of its by-and-by activity. For it is a
        flagship of God, under his diverse care, and message to none of
        the influences of homo action.

        In his hands we must exit it, in the earnest encouragement and belief
that he will not suffer his divine purposes to be feudal, and has this
citizenry, to whom he has intrusted the task of the universe's morphallaxis,
to forget and deny their God, who has lead them on to power and prosperity
and felicity, to go stern upon the scale of the soul's eternal progress,
and become a race of wicked, corrupt, and God-defying bisexual.

        Yet there is those saying more turbulent than the'the gods help
        no who help themselves,'and in this work of lawless encouragement
we have nevertheless a part to act, such work to execute.

        Here we shall have the free-thinking german, the bigoted roman
        catholic, the Frog, and the latitudinarian Yankee, in one grand great
conglomeration of state and content a as the world has never seen.

        Ever will be own meager field for all our exertions, all our part;
and if we do our duty by our own people, we shall be forced, for a clip
at least, to permission that task of instructing the heathen of foreign
lands to the familiarized nations of the old World. Our greatest responsibility
is here, and it behove us to look slowly to the religious culture of our
an rapidly decreasing population, that in after times they may be
suit for a cinch of christianize the world.

        
        

         What rewards could it offer them which would
        induce them systematically to develop, and be willing to
        exercise, their exceptional faculties?

        CHAPTER VII

        PROXIMATE DIFFICULTIES.
        ABLE MEN AS A CORPORATION OF STATE OFFICIALS

        How are the men fittest for posts of industrial power to be
        selected from the less fit?

        This problem solved automatically by the existing system of
        private and separate capitals.

        The fusion of all private capitals into a single state capital
        would make this solution impossible, and would provide no other.
        The only machinery by which the more efficient directors of
        labour could be discriminated from the less efficient would be
        broken. Case of the London County Council's steamboats.

        Two forms which the industrial state under socialism might
        conceivably take: The official directors of industry might be
        either an autocratic bureaucracy, or they might else be subject
        to elected politicians representing the knowledge and opinions
        prevalent among the majority.

        Estimate of the results which would arise in the former case.
        Illustrations from actual bureaucratic enterprise.

        Estimate of the results which would arise in the latter case.
        The state, as representing the average opinion of the masses,
        brought to bear on scientific industrial enterprise.
        Illustrations.

        The state as sole printer and publisher. State capitalism would
        destroy the machinery of industrial progress just as it would
        destroy the machinery by which thought and knowledge develop.

        But behind the question of whether socialism could provide
        ability with the conditions or the machinery requisite for its
        exercise is the question of whether it could provide it with any
        adequate stimulus.

        CHAPTER VIII

        THE ULTIMATE DIFFICULTY.
        SPECULATIVE ATTEMPTS TO MINIMISE IT

        Mr. Sidney Webb, and most modern socialists of the higher kind,
        recognise that this problem of motive underlies all others.

        They approach it indirectly by sociological arguments borrowed
        from other philosophers, and directly by a psychology peculiar
        to themselves.

        The sociological arguments by which socialists seek to minimise
        the claims of the able man.

        These founded on a specific confusion of thought, which vitiated
        the evolutionary sociology of that second half of the nineteenth
        century. Illustrations from Herbert Spencer, Macaulay, Mr. Kidd,
        and recent socialists.

        The confusion in question a confusion between speculative truth
        and practical.

        The individual importance of the able man, untouched by the
        speculative conclusions of the sociological evolutionists, as
        may be seen by the examples adduced in a contrary sense by
        Herbert Spencer. This is partially perceived by Spencer himself.
        Illustrations from his works.

        Ludicrous attempts, on the part of socialistic writers, to apply
        the speculative generalisations of sociology to the practical
        position of individual men.

        The climax of absurdity reached by Mr. Sidney Webb.

        CHAPTER IX

        THE ULTIMATE DIFFICULTY, CONTINUED.
        ABILITY AND INDIVIDUAL MOTIVE

        The individual motives of the able man as dealt with directly by
        modern socialists.

        They abandon their sociological ineptitudes altogether, and
        betake themselves to a psychology which they declare to be
        scientific, but which is based on no analysis of facts, and
        consists really of loose assumptions and false analogies.

        Their treatment of the motives of the artist, the thinker, the
        religious enthusiast, and the soldier.

        Their unscientific treatment of the soldier's motive, and their
        fantastic proposal based on it to transfer this motive from the
        domain of war to that of industry.

        The socialists as their own critics when they denounce the
        actual motives of the able man as he is and as they say he
        always has been. They attack the typically able man of all
        periods as a monster of congenital selfishness, and it is men of
        this special type whom they propose to transform suddenly into
        monsters of self-abnegation.

        Their want of faith in the efficacy of their own moral suasion
        and their proposal to supplement this by the ballot.

        CHAPTER X

        INDIVIDUAL MOTIVE AND DEMOCRACY

        Exaggerated powers ascribed to democracy by inaccurate thinkers.

        An example from an essay by a recent philosophic thinker, with
        special reference to the rewards of exceptional ability.

        This writer maintains that the money rewards of ability can be
        determined by the opinion of the majority expressing itself
        through votes and statutes.

        The writer's typical error. A governing body might enact any
        laws, but they would not be obeyed unless consonant with human
        nature.

        Laws are obliged to conform to the propensities of human nature
        which it is their office to regulate.

        Elaborate but unconscious admission of this fact by the writer
        here quoted himself.

        The power of democracy in the economic sphere, its magnitude and
        its limits. The demands of the minority a counterpart of those
        of the majority.

        The demand of the great wealth-producer mainly a demand for
        power.

        Testimony of a well-known socialist to the impossibility of
        altering the character of individual demand by outside
        influence.

        CHAPTER XI

        CHRISTIAN SOCIALISM AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SECULAR DEMOCRACY

        The meaning of Christian socialism, as restated to-day by a
        typical writer.

        His just criticism of the fallacy underlying modern ideas of
        democracy. The impossibility of equalising unequal men by
        political means.

        Christian socialism teaches, he says, that the abler men should
        make themselves equal to ordinary men by surrendering to them
        the products of their own ability, or else by abstaining from
        its exercise.

        The author's ignorance of the nature of the modern industrial
        process. His idea of steel.

        He confuses the production of wealth on a great scale with the
        acquisition of wealth when produced.

        The only really productive ability which he distinctly
        recognises is that of the speculative inventor.

        He declares that inventors never wish to profit personally by
        their inventions. Let the great capitalists, he says, who merely
        monopolise inventions, imitate the self-abnegation of the
        inventors, and Christian socialism will become a fact.

        The confusion which reigns in the minds of sentimentalists like
        the author here quoted. Their inability to see complex facts and
        principles, in their connected integrity, as they are. Such
        persons herein similar to devisers of perpetual motions and
        systems for defeating the laws of chance at a roulette-table.

        All logical socialistic conclusions drawn from premises in which
        some vital truth or principle is omitted. Omission in the
        premises of the earlier socialists. Corresponding omission in
        the premises of the socialists of to-day.

        Origin of the confusion of thought characteristic of Christian
        as of all other socialists. Temperamental inability to
        understand the complexities of economic life. This inability
        further evidenced by the fact that, with few exceptions,
        socialists themselves are absolutely incompetent as producers.
        Certain popular contentions with regard to modern economic life,
        urged by socialists, but not peculiar to socialism, still remain
        to be considered in the following chapters.

        CHAPTER XII

        THE JUST REWARD OF LABOUR AS ESTIMATED BY ITS ACTUAL PRODUCTS

        Modern socialists admit that of the wealth produced to-day
        labour does not produce the whole, but that some part is
        produced by directive ability. But they contend that labour
        produces more than it gets. We can only ascertain if such an
        assertion is correct by discovering how to estimate with some
        precision the amount produced by labour and ability
        respectively.

        But since for the production of the total product labour and
        ability are both alike necessary, how can we say that any
        special proportion of it is produced by one or the other?

        J.S. Mill's answer to this question.

        The profound error of Mill's argument.

        Practically so much of any effect is due to any one of its
        causes as would be absent from this effect were the cause in
        question taken away. Illustrations.

        Labour itself produces as much as it would produce were there no
        ability to direct it.

        The argument which might be drawn from the case of a community
        in which there was no labour.

        Such an argument illusory; for a community in which there was no
        labour would be impossible; but the paralysis of ability, or its
        practical non-existence possible.

        Practical reasoning of all kinds always confines itself to the
        contemplation of possibilities. Illustrations.

        Restatement of proposition as to the amount of the product of
        labour.

        The product of ability only partially described by assimilating
        it to rent.

        Ability produces everything which would not be produced if its
        operation were hampered or suspended.

        Increased reward of labour in Great Britain since the year 1800.
        The reward now received by labour far in excess of what labour
        itself produces.

        In capitalistic countries generally labour gets, not less, but
        far more than its due, if its due is to be measured by its own
        products.

        It is necessary to remember this; but its due is not to be
        measured exclusively by its own products.

        As will be seen in the concluding chapter.

        CHAPTER XIII

        INTEREST AND ABSTRACT JUSTICE

        The proposal to confiscate interest for the public benefit, on
        the ground that it is income unconnected with any corresponding
        effort.

        Is the proposal practicable? Is it defensible on grounds of
        abstract justice?

        The abstract moral argument plays a large part in the
        discussion.

        It assumes that a man has a moral right to what he produces,
        interest being here contrasted with this, as a something which
        he does not produce.

        Defects of this argument. It ignores the element of time. Some
        forms of effort are productive long after the effort itself has
        ceased.

        For examples, royalties on an acted play. Such royalties herein
        typical of interest generally.

        Industrial interest as a product of the forces of organic
        nature. Henry George's defence of interest as having this
        origin.

        His argument true, but imperfect. His superficial criticism of
        Bastiat.

        Nature works through machine-capital just as truly as it does in
        agriculture.

        Machines are natural forces captured by men of genius, and set
        to work for the benefit of human beings.

        Interest on machine-capital is part of an extra product which
        nature is made to yield by those men who are exceptionally
        capable of controlling her.

        By capturing natural forces, one man of genius may add more to
        the wealth of the world in a year than an ordinary man could add
        to it in a hundred lifetimes.

        The claim of any such man on the products of his genius is
        limited by a variety of circumstances; but, as a mere matter of
        abstract justice, the whole of it belongs to him.

        Abstract justice, however, in a case like this, gives us no
        practical guidance, until we interpret it in connection with
        concrete facts, and translate the just into terms of the
        practicable.

        CHAPTER XIV

        THE SOCIALISTIC ATTACK ON INTEREST AND THE NATURE OF ITS SEVERAL
        ERRORS

        The practical outcome of the moral attack on interest is
        logically an attack on bequest.

        Modern socialism would logically allow a man to inherit
        accumulations, and to spend the principal, but not to receive
        interest on his money as an investment.

        What would be the result if all who inherited capital spent it
        as income, instead of living on the interest of it?

        Two typical illustrations of these ways of treating capital.

        The ultimate difference between the two results.

        What the treatment of capital as income would mean, if the
        practice were made universal. It would mean the gradual loss of
        all the added productive forces with which individual genius has
        enriched the world.

        Practical condemnation of proposed attack on interest.

        Another aspect of the matter.

        Those who attack interest, as distinct from other kinds of
        money-reward, admit that the possession of wealth is necessary
        as a stimulus to production.

        But the possession of wealth is desired mainly for its social
        results far more than for its purely individual results.

        Interest as connected with the sustentation of a certain mode of
        social life.

        Further consideration of the manner in which those who attack
        interest ignore the element of time, and contemplate the present
        moment only.

        The economic functions of a class which is not, at a given
        moment, economically productive.

        Systematic failure of those who attack interest to consider
        society as a whole, continually emerging from the past, and
        dependent for its various energies on the prospects of the
        future.

        Consequent futility of the general attack on interest, though
        interest in certain cases may be justly subjected to special but
        not exaggerated burdens.

        CHAPTER XV

        EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY

        Equality of opportunity, as an abstract demand, is in an
        abstract sense just; but it changes its character when applied
        to a world of unequal individuals.

        Equality of opportunity in the human race-course. To multiply
        competitors is to multiply failures.

        Educational opportunity. Unequal students soon make
        opportunities unequal.

        Opportunity in industrial life. Socialistic promises of equal
        industrial opportunities for all. Each "to paddle his own
        canoe."

        These absurd promises inconsistent with the arguments of
        socialists themselves.

        A socialist's attempt to defend these promises by reference to
        employés of the state post-office.

        Equality of industrial opportunity for those who believe
        themselves possessed of exceptional talent and aspire "to rise."

        Opportunities for such men involve costly experiment, and are
        necessarily limited.

        Claimants who would waste them indefinitely more numerous than
        those who could use them profitably.

        Such opportunities mean the granting to one man the control of
        other men by means of wage-capital.

        Disastrous effects of granting such opportunities to all or even
        most of those who would believe themselves entitled to them.

        True remedy for the difficulties besetting the problem of
        opportunity.

        Ruskin on human demands. Needs and "romantic wishes." The former
        not largely alterable. The latter depend mainly on education.

        The problem practically soluble by a wise moral education only,
        which will correlate demand and expectation with the personal
        capacities of the individual.

        Relative equality of opportunity, not absolute equality, the
        true formula.

        Equality of opportunity, though much talked about by socialists,
        is essentially a formula of competition, and opposed to the

        CHAPTER XVI

        THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE FUTURE

        THE MORAL OF THIS BOOK

        This book, though consisting of negative criticism and analysis
        of facts, and not trenching on the domain of practical policy
        and constructive suggestion, aims at facilitating a rational
        social policy by placing in their true perspective the main
        statical facts and dynamic forces of the modern economic world,
        which socialism merely confuses.

        In pointing out the limitations of labour as a productive
        agency, and the dependence of the labourers on a class other
        than their own, it does not seek to represent the aspirations of
        the former to participate in the benefits of progress as
        illusory, but rather to place such aspirations on a scientific
        basis, and so to remove what is at present the principal
        obstacle that stands in the way of a rational and scientific
        social policy. So much we may take for granted; but here, before
going further, it is necessary to free ourselves from a very common
confusion. When socialism, as thus defined, is spoken of as a thing that
exists--as a thing that has risen and is spreading--two ideas are apt to
suggest themselves to the minds of all parties equally, of which one
coincides with facts, while the other does not, having, indeed, thus far
at all events, no appreciable connection with them; and it is necessary
to get rid of the false idea, and concern ourselves only with the true.

The best way in which I can make my meaning clear will be by referring to a point with regard
to which the earlier socialistic thinkers may be fairly regarded as accurate and original critics.
The so-called orthodox economists of the school of Mill and Ricardo accepted the capitalistic
system as part of the order of nature, and their object was mainly to analyse the peculiar
operations incident to it. The abler among the socialists were foremost in pointing out, on
the contrary, a fact which now would not be denied by anybody: that capitalism in its present
form is a comparatively modern phenomenon, owing its origin historically to the dissolution
of the feudal system, and not having entered on its adolescence, or even on its independent
childhood, till a time which may be roughly indicated as the middle of the eighteenth century.
The immediate causes of its then accelerated development were, as the socialists insist, the
rapid invention of new kinds of machinery, and more especially that of steam as a motor power,
which together inaugurated a revolution in the methods of production generally. Production
on a small scale gave way to production on a large. The independent weavers, for example, each
with his own loom, were wholly unable to compete with the mechanisms of the new factory; their
looms, by being superseded, were virtually taken away from them; and these men, formerly their
own masters, working with their own implements, and living by the sale of their own individual
products, were compelled to pass under the sway of a novel class, the capitalists; to work
with implements owned by the capitalists, not themselves; and to live by the wages of their
labour, not by their sale of the products of it.

Such, as the socialists insist, was the rise of the capitalistic system; and when once it had
been adequately organised, as it first was, in England, it proceeded, they go on to observe,
to spread itself with astonishing rapidity, all other methods disappearing before it, through
their own comparative inefficiency. But when socialists or their opponents turn from capitalism
to socialism, and speak of how socialism has risen and spread likewise, their language, as
thus applied, has no meaning whatever unless it is interpreted in a totally new sense. For
in the sense in which socialists speak of the rise and spread of capitalism, socialism has,
up to the present time, if we except a number of small and unsuccessful experiments, never
risen or spread or had any existence at all. Capitalism rose and spread as an actual working
system, which multiplied and improved the material appliances of life in a manner beyond the
reach of the older system displaced by it. It realised results of which previously mankind
had hardly dreamed. Socialism, on the other hand, has risen and spread thus far, not as a system
which is threatening to supersede capitalism by its actual success as an alternative system
of production, but merely as a theory or belief that such an alternative is possible. Let us
take any country or any city we please--for example, let us say Chicago, in which socialism
is said to be achieving its most hopeful or most formidable triumphs--and we shall look in
vain for a sign that the general productive process has been modified by socialistic principles
in any particular whatsoever. Socialism has produced resolutions at endless public meetings;
it has produced discontent and strikes; it has hampered production constantly. But socialism
has never inaugurated an improved chemical process; it has never bridged an estuary or built
an ocean liner; it has never produced or cheapened so much as a lamp or a frying-pan. It is
a theory that such things could be accomplished by the practical application of its principles;
but, except for the abortive experiments to which I have referred already, it is thus far a
theory only, and it is as a theory only that we can examine it.

What, then, as a theory, are the distinctive features of socialism? Here is a question which,
if we address it indiscriminately to all the types of people who now call themselves socialists,
seems daily more impossible to answer; for every day the number of those is increasing who
claim for their own opinions the title of socialistic, but whose quarrel with the existing
system is very far from apparent, while less apparent still is the manner in which they propose
to alter it. The persons to whom I refer consist mainly of academic students, professors, clergymen,
and also of emotional ladies, who enjoy the attention of footmen in faultless liveries, and
say their prayers out of prayer-books with jewelled clasps. All these persons unite in the
general assertion that, whatever may be amiss with the world, the capitalistic system is responsible
for it, and that somehow or other this system ought to be altered. But when we ask them to
specify the details as to which alteration is necessary--what precisely are the parts of it
which they wish to abolish and what, if these were abolished, they would introduce as a substitute--one
of them says one thing, another of them says another, and nobody says anything on which three
of them could act in concert.

Now, if socialism were confined to such persons as these, who are in America spoken of as the
"parlour socialists," it would not only be impossible to tell what socialism actually was,
but what it was or was not would be immaterial to any practical man. As a matter of fact, however,
between socialism of this negligible kind--this sheet-lightning of sentiment reflected from
a storm elsewhere--and the socialism which is really a factor to be reckoned with in the life
of nations, we can start with drawing a line which, when once drawn, is unmistakable. Socialism
being avowedly a theory which, in the first instance at all events, addresses itself to the
many as distinct from and opposed to the few, it is only or mainly the fact of its adoption
by the many which threatens to render it a practical force in politics. Its practical importance
accordingly depends upon two things--firstly, on its possessing a form sufficiently definite
to unite what would otherwise be a mass of heterogeneous units, by developing in all of them
a common temper and purpose; and, secondly, on the number of those who can be taught to adopt
and welcome it. The theory of socialism is, therefore, as a practical force, primarily that
form of it which is operative among the mass of socialists; and when once we realise this,
we shall have no further difficulty in discovering what the doctrines are with which, at all
events, we must begin our examination. We are guided to our starting-point by the broad facts
of history.

The rights of the many as opposed to the actual position of the few--a society in which all
should be equal, not only in political status, but also in social circumstances; ideas such
as these are as old as the days of Plato, and they have, from time to time in the ancient and
the modern world, resulted in isolated and abortive attempts to realise them. In Europe such
ideas were rife during the sixty or seventy years which followed the great political revolution
in France. Schemes of society were formulated which were to carry this revolution further,
and concentrate effort on industrial rather than political change. Pictures were presented
to the imagination, and the world was invited to realise them, of societies in which all were
workers on equal terms, and groups of fraternal citizens, separated no longer by the egoisms
of the private home, dwelt together in palaces called "phalansteries," which appear to have
been imaginary anticipations of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Here lapped in luxury, they were
to feast at common tables; and between meals the men were to work in the fields singing, while
a lady accompanied their voices on a grand piano under a hedge. These pictures, however, agreeable
as they were to the fancy, failed to produce any great effect on the multitudes; for the multitudes
felt instinctively that they were too good to be true. That such was the case is admitted by
socialistic historians themselves. Socialism during this period was, they say, in its "Utopian
stage." It was not even sufficiently coherent to have acquired a distinctive name till the
word "socialism" was coined in connection with the views of Owen, which suffered discredit
from the failure of his attempts to put them into practice. Socialism in those days was a dream,
but it was not science; and in a world which was rapidly coming to look upon science as supreme,
nothing could convince men generally--not even the most ignorant--which had not, or was not
supposed to have, the authority of science at the back of it.

Such being the situation, as the socialists accurately describe it, an eminent thinker arose
who at last supplied what was wanting. He provided the unorganised aspirations, which by this
time were known as socialism, with a formula which was at once definite, intelligible, and
comprehensive, and had all the air of being rigidly scientific also. By this means thoughts
and feelings, previously vague and fluid, like salts held in solution, were crystallised into
a clear-cut theory which was absolutely the same for all; which all who accepted it could accept
with the same intellectual confidence; and which thus became a moral and mental nucleus around
which the efforts and hopes of a coherent party could group themselves.

Such was the feat accomplished by Karl Marx, through his celebrated treatise on Capital, which
was published between fifty and sixty years ago, and which has, since then, throughout all
Europe and America, been acclaimed as the Magna Charta, or the Bible, of "scientific socialism."

Whatever may be the change which, as a theory, socialism has subsequently undergone--and changes
there have been which will presently occupy our attention--it is with the theory of Marx, and
the temper of mind resulting from it, that socialism, regarded as a practical force, begins;
and among the majority of socialists this theory is predominant still. In view, therefore,
of the requirements of logic, of history, and of contemporary facts, our own examination must
begin with the theory of Marx likewise.

CHAPTER II

THE THEORY OF MARX AND THE EARLIER SOCIALISTS SUMMARISED

All radical revolutions which are advocated in the interests of the people are commended to
the people, and the people are invited to accomplish them, on the ground that majorities are,
if they would only realise it, capable of moulding society in any manner they please. As applied
to matters of legislation and government, this theory is sufficiently familiar to everybody.
It has been elaborated in endless detail, and has expressed itself in the constitutions of
all modern democracies. What Karl Marx did, and did for the first time, was to invest this
theory of the all-efficiency of the majority with a definiteness, in respect of distribution
of wealth, similar to that with which it had been invested already in respect of the making
of laws and the dictation of national policies.

The practical outcome of the scientific reasoning of Marx is summed up in the formula which
has figured as the premise and conclusion of every congress of his followers, of every book
or manifesto published by them, and of every propagandist oration uttered by them at street-corners,
namely, "All wealth is produced by labour, therefore to the labourers all wealth is due"--a
doctrine in itself not novel if taken as a pious generality, but presented by Marx as the outcome
of an elaborate system of economics.

The efficiency of this doctrine as an instrument of agitation is obvious. It appeals at once
to two universal instincts: the instinct of cupidity and the instinct of universal justice.
It stimulates the labourers to demand more than they receive already, and it stimulates to
demand the more on the ground that they themselves have produced it. It teaches them that the
wealth of every man who is not a manual labourer is something stolen from themselves which
ought to be and which can be restored to them.

Now, whatever may be the value of such teaching as a contribution to economic science, it illustrates
by its success one cardinal truth, and by implication it bears witness to another. The first
truth is that, no matter how desirable any object may be which is obtruded on the imagination
of anybody, nobody will bestir himself in a practical way to demand it until he can be persuaded
to believe that its attainment is practically possible. The other is this: that the possibilities
of redistributing wealth depend on the causes by which wealth is produced. All wealth, says
Marx, can practically be appropriated by the labourers. But why? Because the labourers themselves
comprise in their own labour all the forces that produce it. If its production necessitated
the activity of any persons other than themselves, these other persons would inevitably have
some control over its distribution; since if it were distributed in a manner of which these
other persons disapproved, it would be open to them to refuse to take part in its production
any longer; and there would, in consequence, be no wealth, or less wealth, to distribute.

Let us, then, examine the precise sense and manner in which this theory of labour as the sole
producer of wealth is elaborated and defended by Marx in his Bible of Scientific Socialism.
His argument, though the expression of it is very often pedantic and encumbered with superfluous
mathematical formulæ, is ingenious and interesting, and is associated with historical criticism
which, in spite of its defects, is valuable. Marx was, indeed, foremost among those thinkers
already referred to who first insisted on the fact that the economic conditions of to-day are
mainly a novel development of others which went before them, and that, having their roots in
history, they must be studied by the historical method. He recognised, however, that for practical
purposes each age must concern itself with its own environment; and his logical starting-point
is an analysis of wealth-production as it exists to-day. He begins by insisting on the fact
that labour in the modern world is divided with such a general and such an increasing minuteness
that each labour produces one kind of product only, of which he himself can consume but a small
fraction, and often consumes nothing. His own product, therefore, has for him the character
of wealth only because he is able to exchange it for commodities of other kinds; and the amount
of wealth represented by it depends upon what the quantity of other assorted commodities, which
he can get in exchange for it, is. What, then, is the common measure, in accordance with which,
as a fact, one kind of commodity will exchange for any other, or any others? For his answer
to this question Marx goes to the orthodox economists of his time--the recognised exponents
of the system against which his own arguments were directed--and notably, among these, to Ricardo;
and, adopting Ricardo's conclusions, as though they were axiomatic, he asserts that the measure
of exchange between one class of commodities and another--such, for example, as cigars, printed
books, and chronometers--is the amount of manual labour, estimated in terms of time, which
is on an average necessary to the production of each of them. His meaning in this respect is
illustrated with pictorial vividness by his teaching with regard to the form in which the measure
of exchange should embody itself. This, he said, ought not to be gold or silver, but "labour-certificates,"
which would indicate that whoever possessed them had laboured for so many hours in producing
no matter what, and which would purchase anything else, or any quantity of anything else, representing
an equal expenditure of labour of any other kind.

Having thus settled, as it seemed to him beyond dispute, that manual labour, estimated in terms
of time, is the sole source and measure of economic values or of wealth, Marx goes on to point
out that, by the improvement of industrial methods, labour in the modern world has been growing
more and more productive, so that each labour-hour results in an increased yield of commodities.
Thus a man who a couple of centuries ago could have only just kept himself alive by the products
of his entire labour-day, can now keep himself alive by the products of half or a quarter of
it. The products of the remainder of his labour-day are what Marx called a "surplus value,"
meaning by this phrase all that output of wealth which is beyond what is practically necessary
to keep the labourer alive. But what, he asks, becomes of this surplus? Does it go to the labourers
who have produced it? No, he replies. On the contrary, as fast as it is produced, it is abstracted
from the labourer in a manner, which he goes on to analyse, by the capitalist.

Marx here advances to the second stage of his argument. Capital, as he conceives of it, is
the tools or instruments of production; and modern capital for him means those vast aggregates
of machinery by the use of which in most industries the earlier implements have been displaced.
Now, here, says Marx, the capitalist is sure to interpose with the objection that the increased
output of wealth is due, not to labour, but to the machinery, and that the labourer, as such,
has consequently no claim on it. But to this objection Marx is ready with the following answer--that
the machinery itself is nothing but past labour in disguise. It is past labour crystallised,
or embodied in an external form, and used by present labour to assist itself in its own operations.
Every wheel, crank, and connecting-rod, every rivet in every boiler, owes its shape and its
place to labour, and labour only. Labour, therefore--the labour of the average multitude--remains
the sole agent in the production of wealth, after all.

Capital, however, as thus understood, has, he says, this peculiarity--that, being labour in
an externalised and also in a permanent form, it is capable of being detached from the labourers
and appropriated by other people; and the essence of modern capitalism is neither more nor
less than this--the appropriation of the instruments of production by a minority who are not
producers. So long as the implements of production were small and simple, and such that each
could be used by one man or family, the divorce between the labourer and his implements was
not easy to accomplish; but in proportion as these simple implements were developed into the
aggregated mechanisms of the factory, each of which aggregates was used in common by hundreds
and even by thousands of labourers, the link between the implement and the user was broken
by an automatic process; for a single organised mechanism used by a thousand men could not,
in the nature of things, be owned by each one of the thousand individually, and collective
ownership by all of them was an idea as yet unborn. Under these circumstances, with the growth
of modern machinery, the ownership of the implements of production passed, by what Marx looked
upon as a kind of historical fatality, into the hands of a class whose activities were purely
acquisitive, and had no true connection with the process of production at all; and this class,
he said, constitutes the capitalists of the modern world.

The results of this process have, according to him, been as follows: Society has become divided
into two contrasted groups--an enormous group, and a small one. The enormous group--the great
body of every nation--the people--the labouring mass--the one true producing power--has been
left without any implements by means of which its labour can exert itself, and these implements
have been monopolised by the small group alone. The people at large, in fact, have become like
the employés of a single mill-owner, who have no choice but to work within the walls of that
mill or starve; and the possessing class at large has become like the owner of such a single
mill, who, holding the keys of life and death in his hands, is able to impose on the mill-workers
almost any terms he pleases as the price of admission to his premises and to the privilege
of using his machinery; and the price which such an owner, so situated, will exact (such was
the contention of Marx) inevitably must come, and historically has come, to this--namely, the
entire amount of goods which the labouring class produces, except such a minimum as will just
enable its members to keep themselves in working order, and to reproduce their kind. Thus all
capital, as at present owned, all profits, and all interest on capital, are neither more nor
less than thefts from the labouring class of commodities which are produced by the labouring
class alone.

The argument of Marx is not, however, finished yet. There remains a third part of it which
we still have to consider. Writing as he did, almost half a century ago, he said that the process
of capitalistic appropriation had not--yet completed itself. A remnant of producers on a restricted
scale survived, still forming a middle class, which was neither rich nor poor. But, he continued,
in all capitalistic countries, a new movement, inevitable from the first, had set in, and its
pace was daily accelerating. Just as the earlier capitalists swallowed up most of the small
producers, so were the great capitalists swallowing up the smaller, and the middle class which
survived was disappearing day by day. Wages, meanwhile, were regulated by an iron law. Under
the system of capitalism it was an absolute impossibility that they could rise. As he put it,
in language which has since become proverbial, "The rich are getting richer, the poor poorer,
the middle class is being crushed out," and the time, he continued, was in sight already--it
would arrive, according to him, before the end of the nineteenth century--when nothing would
be left but a handful of idle and preposterous millionaires on the one hand, and a mass of
miserable ragamuffins who provided all the millions on the other, having for themselves only
enough food and clothing to enable them to move their muscles and protect their nakedness from
the frost. Then, said Marx, when this contrast has completed itself, the situation will be
no longer tolerable. "Then the knell of the capitalistic system will have sounded." The producers
will assert themselves under the pressure of an irresistible impulse; they will repossess themselves
of the implements of production of which they have been so long deprived. "The expropriators
will in their turn be expropriated," and the labourers thenceforth owning the implements of
production collectively, all the wealth of the world will forever afterwards be theirs.

This concluding portion of the gospel of Marx--its prophecies--has been in many of its details
so completely falsified by events that even his most ardent disciples no longer insist on it.
I have only mentioned it here because of the further light which it throws on what alone, in
this discussion, concerns us--namely, the Marxian theory of labour as the sole producer of
wealth, and the absolute nullity, so far as production goes, of every form of activity associated
with the possession of capital, or with any class but the labouring.

This theory of production, then, which has been the foundation of socialism as a party--or,
as Gronlünd, a disciple of Marx, calls it, "its idée mère"--and which is still its foundation
for the great majority of socialists, we will now examine in detail, and, considering how complex
are the processes of production in the modern world, ask how far it gives us, or fails to give
us, even an approximately complete account of them.

We shall find that, in spite of the plausibility with which the talent of Marx invested it,
this basic doctrine of so-called scientific socialism is the greatest intellectual mare's-nest
of the century which has just ended; and when once we have realised with precision on what,
in the modern world, the actual efficiency of the productive process depends, we shall see
that the analysis of Marx bears about the same relation to the economic facts of to-day that
the child's analysis of matter into the four traditional elements, or the doctrine of Thales
that everything is made of water, bears to the facts of chemistry as modern science has revealed
them to us. In the case of Marx we can find this without difficulty, for the first observation
which our subject will naturally suggest to us is an admission that, within limits, his theory
of production is true. Whatever may be the agencies which are required to produce wealth, human
effort is one of them; and into whatever kinds this necessary agency may divide itself, one
kind must always be labour, in the sense in which Marx understood it--in other words, that
use of the hands and muscles by which the majority of mankind have always gained their livelihood.

It is, moreover, easy to point out actual cases in which all the wealth that is produced is
produced by labour only. The simplest of such cases are supplied us by the lowest savages,
who manage, by their utmost exertions, to provide themselves with the barest necessaries. Such
cases show that labour, wherever it exists, produces at least a minimum of what men require;
for if it were not so there would be no men to labour. Such cases show also another thing.
The most primitive races possess rude implements of some kind, which any pair of hands can
fashion, just as any pair of hands can use them. These rude implements are capital in its embryonic
form; and so far as they go, they verify the Marxian theory that capital is nothing but past
labour crystallised.

But we need not, in order to see labour, past and present, operating and producing in a practically
unalloyed condition, go to savage or even semi-civilised countries. The same thing may be seen
among groups of peasant proprietors, which still survive here and there in the remoter parts
of Europe. These men and their families, by their own unaided labour, produce nearly everything
which they eat and wear and use. The human rustic were like representation they will ignore all they

 Thus in wage-capital we have the capital of the modern world in what dynamically
is its primary and parent form--a kind of capital which improved machinery is always tending
to augment, but of whose use the machinery itself, its renewal, and its continued improvement,
are the consequences.

That such is the case might be illustrated by any number of familiar examples. A man invents
a new machine having some useful purpose--let us say the production of some new kind of manure,
which will double the fertility of every field in the country. In order to put this machine
on the market, and make it a fact instead of a mere conception, the first thing necessary is,
as every human being knows, that the inventor shall possess, or acquire, the control of capital.
And what is the next step? When the capital is provided, how will it first be used? It will
be used in the form of wages, or articles of daily consumption, which will be distributed among
a certain number of mechanics and other labourers, on condition that they set about fashioning,
in certain prescribed groups, so much metal into so many prescribed shapes--some of them shaping
it into wheels, some into knives and rollers, some into sieves, rods, cranks, cams, and eccentrics,
in accordance with patterns which have never been followed previously; and of all these individual
operations the new machine, as a practical implement, is the result. The machine is new, and
it is an addition to the wealth-producing powers of the world, not because it embodies so much
labour, but because it embodies so much labour directed in a new way; and it is only by means
of the conditions which the possession of wage-capital enables the inventor or his partners
to impose upon every one of the labourers that the machine, as a practical implement, comes
into existence at all.

Hence we see that Marx was at once right and wrong when he said that modern capitalism is,
in its essence, monopoly. It is monopoly; but it is not primarily, as Marx thought, a passive
monopoly of improved instruments of production. It is primarily a monopoly of products which
are essential to the life of the labourer; and it is a monopoly of these, not in the invidious
sense that the monopolists retain them for their own personal consumption, as they do in the
case of rare wines and fabrics, which can, from the nature of the case, be enjoyed by a few
only. It is a monopoly of them in the sense that the monopolists have such a control over their
distribution as enables them to control the purely technical actions of those persons who ultimately
own and consume the whole of them.[2]

Modern capital, then, I repeat, is primarily wage-capital, such capital as modern machinery
being the direct result of its application; and wage-capital is productive, not in virtue of
any quality inherent in itself, but merely because as a fact, under the modern system, it constitutes
the reins by which the exceptional ability of a few guides the labour, skilled or unskilled,
of the many. It is the means by which the commonest labourer, who hardly knows the rule of
three, is made to work as though he were master of the abstruest branches of mathematics; by
which the artisan who only has a smattering--if he has as much as that--of mechanics, metallurgy,
chemistry, is made to work as though all the sciences had been assimilated by his single brain.

Let any one consider, for example, one of the great steel bridges which now throw their single
spans over waters such as the Firth of Forth. These structures are crystallised labour, doubtless,
but they are, in their distinctive features, not crystallised labour as such. They are crystallised
mechanics, crystallised chemistry, crystallised mathematics--in short, crystallised intellect,
knowledge, imagination, and executive capacity, of kinds which hardly exist in a dozen minds
out of a million; and labour conduces to the production of such astonishing structures only
because it submits itself to the guidance of these intellectual leaders. And the same is the
case with modern production generally. Though labour is essential to the production of wealth
even in the smallest quantities, the distinguishing productivity of industry in the modern
world depends not on the labour, but on the ability with which the labour is directed; and
in the modern world the primary function of capital is that of providing ability with its necessary
instrument of direction.

No unprejudiced person, who is capable of coherent thought, can, when the matter is thus plainly
stated, possibly deny this. That it cannot be denied will be shown in the two following chapters
by recent admissions on the part of socialists themselves, the more thoughtful of whom have
now virtually abandoned the earlier theoretical framework of socialism altogether, and are
trying to substitute a new one, with which we will deal later, and which will indeed prove
the main subject of our inquiry.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] When I insisted on this distinction between "labour" and "ability" in America, innumerable
critics met me with two objections. One of these, as stated by a writer who confessed himself
otherwise in entire agreement with me, was this: "It is impossible, as Mr. Mallock attempts
to do, to draw a hard-and-fast line between mental effort and muscular." No such attempt is
made. As I pointed out in one of my speeches, many kinds of "labour" (e.g. that of the great
painter) exhibit higher mentality than do many kinds of ability. Further, I pointed out that,
in a technical sense, the same effort may be either an effort of labour or ability, according
to its application. Thus, if a singer sings to an audience, his effort is technically "labour,"
because it ends with the single task; but if he sings so as to produce a gramophone record,
his effort is an act of "ability," for he influences the products of other men, by whom the
records are multiplied. The second objection was expressed by one of my critics thus: "I say
that all productive effort is labour.... I dare you to tell any one of these genii that they
are not labourers." Another critic said: "Just as 'land' in economics means all the forces
of nature, so does 'labour' mean all the forces of man. Why, then, speak of ability?" These
criticisms are purely verbal. If we like to take "labour" as a collective name for all forms
of human effort, we can of course do so; but in that case we must find other differential names
for the different forces of effort individually. To give them all the same name is not to explain
them. It is to tie them all up in a parcel.

[2] If this fact requires any further exemplification, we can find one on a large scale in
the pages of Marx himself. According to him the first appreciable capitalistic movement--the
first leaping of the modern system in the womb--took place in the English cloth trade about
four hundred years ago. Now, if capitalism were merely, as according to Marx it is, a passive
monopoly by some men of implements which have been produced by others, the pioneers of capitalism
in the reign of Henry VIII. would have got into their possession all the hand-looms then in
use; they would have taken their toll in kind from all whom they allowed to use them; and there
the matter would have ended. The looms of to-day would be the looms of four hundred years ago.
The passive ownership of machines does nothing to improve their construction. If a gang of
ignorant thieves could steal all the watches in America, and then let them out to the public
at so much a month or year, this would not convert the three-dollar watches into chronometers.
And how little mere labour, or the experience gained by labour, tends to improve the implements
which the labourer uses is shown by the fact that the looms which wove Anne Boleyn's petticoats
were practically the same as the looms which wove those of Semiramis. When I delivered, as
I did recently, a series of addresses on socialism to various meetings in America, I approached
the subject in the manner in which I have approached it here. I began with the process of production
pure and simple, and I showed how crude and childish, as applied to production in modern times,
was the analysis of Marx and all the earlier socialists. I showed, as I have shown here, that,
the amount of labour being given, the quantity and quality of wealth that will result from
its exercise depend on the ability with which by means of wage-capital this labour is directed.

The two addresses in which these points were elaborated had no sooner been delivered than,
from all parts of the country, through newspapers and private letters, and sometimes by word
of mouth, socialists of various types addressed themselves to the business of replying to me.
These replies, whatever may have been their differences otherwise, all took the form of a declaration
that I was only wasting my time in exposing the doctrine that labour is the sole producer of
wealth, and in laying such stress on the part played by directive ability; for no serious socialist
of the present day any longer believed the one, or failed to recognise the other. Thus one
of my critics told me that what I ought to do was "to discuss the principles of socialism as
understood and accepted by the intelligent disciples, and not the worn-out and discredited
theories of Marx." Another was good enough to tell me that I had "cleverly accomplished the
task of exposing the errors of Marx, both of premise and of logic"; but the leaders of socialistic
thought "in its later developments" had, he proceeded to say, long ago outgrown these. A third
wrote me a letter bristling with all kinds of challenges, and asked me if I thought, for example,
that socialists were such fools as not to recognise that the talents of an inventor like Mr.
Edison increased the productivity of labour by the new direction which they gave to it. I might
multiply similar quotations, but one more will be enough here. It is taken from a long article
directed against myself by Mr. Hillquit--a writer to whom my special attention was called as
by far the most accomplished exponent, among the militant socialists of America, of socialism
in its most logical and most highly developed form. "It requires," said Mr. Hillquit, "no special
genius to demonstrate that all labour is not alike, nor equally productive. It is still more
obvious that common manual labour is impotent to produce the wealth of modern nations--that
organisation, direction, and control are essential to productive work in the field of modern
production, and are just as much a factor in it as mere physical effort."[3]

But we need not confine ourselves to my own late critics in America. The general history of
socialism as a reasoned theory is practically the same in one country as in another. The intellectual
socialists in England, among whom Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. Sidney Webb are prominent, express
themselves in even plainer terms with regard to the part which directive ability, as opposed
to labour, plays in the modern world. "Ability," says Mr. Shaw, employing the very word, is
often the factor which determines whether a given industry shall make a loss of five per cent.
or else a profit of twenty; and Mr. Webb, as we shall have occasion to see presently, carries
the argument further, and states it in greater detail.

Why, then, it may be asked, should a critic of contemporary socialism think it worth while
to expose with so much minuteness a fallacy which intellectual socialists now all agree in
repudiating, and to insist with such emphasis on facts which they profess to recognise as self-evident?
To this question there are two answers.

One of these I indicated at the close of our opening chapter; and this at the cost of what
in logic is a mere digression, it will be desirable, for practical purposes, to state it with
greater fulness.

Admissions and assertions, such as those which I have just now quoted, do, no doubt, represent
a definite intellectual advance which has taken place in the theory of socialism, among those
who are its most thoughtful exponents, and in a certain sense its leaders. They represent what
these leaders think and say among themselves, and what they put forward when disputing with
opponents who are competent to criticise them. But what they do not represent is socialism
as still preached to the populace, or the doctrine which is still vital for socialists as a
popular party. This is still, just as it was originally, the socialism of Marx in an absolutely
unamended form. It is the doctrine that the manual efforts of the vast multitude of labourers,
directed only by the minds of the individual labourers themselves, produce all the wealth of
the world; that the holding of any of this wealth by any other class whatever stands for nothing
but a system of legalised plunder; and that the labourers need only inaugurate a legislation
of a new kind in order to secure and enjoy what always was by rights their own. Let me illustrate
this assertion by two examples, one supplied to us by England, the other by America.

In England the body which calls itself the Social Democratic Federation, and represents at
this moment socialism of the more popular kind, began its campaign with a manifesto which was
headed with the familiar words, "All wealth is due to labour; therefore to the labourer all
wealth is due." This text or motto was followed by certain figures, with regard to the total
income of Great Britain, and the manner in which it is at present distributed. Labour was represented
as getting less than one-fourth of the whole, and the labourers were informed that if they
would but "educate themselves, agitate, and organise," the remaining three-fourths would automatically
pass into their possession. This document, it is true, was issued some twenty years ago;[4]
but that the form which socialism takes, when addressed to the masses of the population, has
not appreciably altered from that day to this, will be made sufficiently clear by the following
pertinent fact. Shortly after my arrival in America, in the winter of 1907, the most active
disseminator of socialistic literature in New York sent me, by way of a challenge, a new and
very spruce volume, which contained the most important of his previous leaflets and articles,
collected and republished, and claiming renewed attention. The first of these--and it was signalised
by an accompanying advertisement as fundamental--bore the impressive title of, "Why the Working
Man should be a Socialist," and the answer to this question is given in the writer's opening
words. "You know," he says, addressing any labourer and the street-worker, "or you ought to
know, that you alone produce all the good things of life; and you know, or you ought to know,
that by so simple a process as that of casting your ballot intelligently you will be able"--to
do what? The writer explains himself in language which, except for a difference in his statistics,
is almost a verbal repetition of that of his English predecessors. He specifies two sums, one
representing the income which each working-man in America would receive were the entire wealth
of the country divided equally among the manual labourers; the other representing the income
which, on an average, he actually receives as wages; and the writer tells every working man
that, by "merely casting his ballot intelligently," he can secure for himself the whole difference
between the larger sum and the less.[5]

But the fact that the Marxian doctrine of the all-productivity of labour, and the consequent
economic nullity of all other forms of effort, still supplies the main ideas by which popular
socialism is vitalised, is shown perhaps even more distinctly by the popular hopes and demands
which result from this doctrine indirectly than it is by the direct reassertion of the formal
doctrine itself. One of the members of the Parliamentary Labour party in England celebrated
his success at the polls by a letter to the Times, proclaiming that socialism was a moral quite
as much as an economic movement, and that an object which to socialists was dearer even than
the seizure of the riches of the rich, was the achievement of "economic freedom," or, in other
words, the "emancipation of labour," or, in other words again, the abolition of the system
which he described as "wagedom." I merely mention the particular letter in question in order
to remind the reader of these familiar phrases, which are current in every country where the
theory of socialism has spread itself.

Now, what does all this talk about the emancipation of labour mean? It can only mean one or
other of two things: either that the economic prosperity of every nation in the future will
depend on the emancipation of every average mind from the guidance of any minds that are in
any way superior to itself, or are able to enhance the productivity of an average pair of hands--a
proposition so ludicrous that nobody would consciously assent to it; or else it means a continued
assent to the theory which fails to correlate labour with directive ability at all, and so
never raises the question of whether the latter is necessary or no.

What, then, becomes of that chorus of vehement protestations, with which my critics in America
were all so eager to overwhelm me, to the effect that socialists to-day recognise as clearly
as I do that "common manual labour," as Mr. Hillquit puts it, "is impotent to produce the wealth
of modern nations," apart from the "organisation and control" of the minds most competent to
direct it? That the more intellectual socialists of to-day do recognise this fact--some with
greater and some with less distinctness--is the very point on which I am anxious to insist.
We shall have abundant opportunities for considering it later on. For the moment, however,
I pause to ask them the following question. Recognising, as they do, and eagerly proclaiming
as they do, whenever they address themselves to those who are capable of serious dispute with
them, that the original theory of socialism, which was the creed of such bodies as the International,
is absolutely false in itself, and in many of the expectations which it stimulates, why do
not they set themselves, whenever they address the multitude, to expose and repudiate a fallacy
in which they no longer believe? Do they do this? Do they make an attempt to do this? On the
contrary, as a rule, though there are doubtless many honourable exceptions, they endeavour
to hide from the multitude their intellectual change of front altogether; and, instead of insisting
that the undirected labour of the many is, in the modern world, impotent to produce anything,
they continue to speak of it as though it produced everything, and as though no class other
than the labouring fulfilled any economic function or had any right to exist.[6]

Let me give the reader an example, which is curiously apt here. It is taken from Mr. Hillquit's
own attack on myself, which filled the front sheet of a newspaper, and was distributed to the
public at the door of one of the buildings in which I spoke. Of the short passages, amounting
to some twenty lines out of six hundred, in which alone he condescended to detailed argument,
the first is that in which, as we have already seen, he declares that all socialists know,
without any instruction on my part, that common manual labour, unless it is directed by ability,
is "impotent to produce the wealth of modern nations." But having made this admission with
much blowing of trumpets, he immediately drops it, and instead of developing its consequences,
he diverts the attention of his readers from it by a long series of irrelevancies; nor does
he return to the question of directive ability at all till he is nearing the end of his discourse,
when he suddenly takes it up again, declaring that he will meet and refute me on ground which
I myself have chosen, and show that wealth--at all events in the commercial sense--is still
produced by manual labour alone. He refers to my selection of the case of a printed book, as
illustrating, in the manner explained in an earlier chapter, the part which directive ability
plays in modern production. The economic value of an edition of a printed book, I said, as
the reader will remember, depends in the most obvious way, not on the labour of compositors,
but on the quality of the directions which the author imposes on this labour through his manuscript--the
author's mind being typical of directive ability generally. And what has Mr. Hillquit--the
intellectual Ajax of the socialists--got to say about this? "Whether a book," he says, "is
a work of genius or mere rubbish will largely affect its literary or artistic value; but it
will have very little bearing on its economic or commercial value." This, he goes on to argue,
will, despite all my objections, be found to depend on ordinary manual labour, of which the
labour of the hands of the compositors is that which concerns us most. Nothing, according to
him, can be more evident than this. "For the market price," he says, "of a wretched detective
story, of the same length as Hamlet, and printed in the same way, will be exactly the same
as that of a copy of Hamlet itself."

Now, if we consider Mr. Hillquit as a purely literary critic, we can but admire his subtlety
in discovering that the literary value of a book is largely affected by the fact of the book's
not being rubbish; but when he descends from pure criticism to economics, it is difficult,
unless we suppose him to have taken leave of his senses, to imagine that he can himself believe
in the medley of nonsense propounded by him. For what he is here doing--or more probably pretending
to do--is to confuse the cost of producing an edition of a book with the commercial value of
that edition when produced. The labour in question no doubt determines the price at which the
printed paper can be sold at a profit, or without loss; but the number of copies which the
public will be willing to buy, or, in other words, the value of the edition commercially, depends
on qualities resident in the mind of the author, which render the book attractive to but few
readers, or to many. Whether these qualities amount to genius in the higher sense of the word,
or to nothing more than a knack of titillating the curiosity of the vulgar, does not affect
the question. In either case--and this is the sole important fact--they are qualities of the
author's mind, and of the author's mind alone; and the labour of the compositors conduces to
the production of a pile of volumes which is of large, of little, or of no value commercially,
not according to the dexterity with which this labour is performed, but according to the manner
in which the author's mind directs it.

Than any human being who is capable of perceiving that the literary quality of a book is largely
affected by the fact of the book's not being rubbish, should seriously suppose that the saleable
value of editions--whether they are editions of a popular novel, or of a treatise on the conchology
of Kamchatka, is proportionate to the number of letters in them arranged in parallel lines--for
Mr. Hillquit's argument means neither more nor less than this--is, let me repeat, incredible.
What, then, is the explanation of his indulging in a performance of this degrading kind? The
explanation is that he, like so many of his colleagues, though recognising personally that
labour among "modern nations" depends for its higher productivity on the picked men who direct
it, cannot bring himself to renounce, when he is making his appeal to the masses, the old doctrine
that they are the sole producers; and accordingly having started with the ostentatious admission
that directive ability is as essential to production as labour is, he endeavours by his verbal
jugglery with the case of a printed book to convey the impression that labour produces all
values after all; and he actually manages to wind up with a repetition of the old Marxian moral
that the profits of ability mean nothing but labour which has not been paid for.[7]

One of my reasons, then, for beginning the present examination of socialism with exposing the
fallacy of principles which the intellectual socialists of to-day are so eager to proclaim
that they have long since abandoned, is the fact that these principles are still the principles
of the multitude; that for practical purposes they are those which most urgently require refutation;
and that the intellectual socialists who have doubtless repudiated them personally, not only
do not attempt to discredit them in the eyes of the ignorant, but themselves continue to appeal
to them as instruments of popular agitation.

My other reason for following the course in question is that the theory of socialism in its
higher and more recent forms, which recognises directive intellect in addition to manual effort
as one of the forces essential to the production of modern wealth, cannot be understood and
estimated in any profitable way, without a previous examination of those earlier doctrines
and ideas, some of which it still retains, while it modifies and rejects others.

And now let us take up again the thread of our main argument. We laid this down early in the
present chapter, having emphasised the fact that, the intellectual socialists of to-day agree,
on their own admission, with one proposition at all events which has been elucidated in this
volume--namely, that labour alone, as one of their spokesmen puts it, "is impotent to produce
the wealth of modern nations," the faculties and the functions of the minority by whom labour
is directed and organised being no less essential to the result than the labour of the majority
itself. In the following chapter we shall see that this agreement extends yet further.

FOOTNOTES:

[3] Mr. Hillquit--a lawyer, who has adopted the business of propagating socialism in America--is
unknown in England; but his name, not long ago, was to be found in the English papers, as that
of one of the representatives sent from America to a recent Socialistic Congress in Europe.
Amongst the socialists of the United States he holds a position analogous to that enjoyed by
Mr. Shaw, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Ramsey Macdonald in England.

[4] Whilst this work was in the press a "Catechism," lately published in England, for use of
children, was sent me. It was proposed to use this Catechism on Sundays in the London County
Council Schools. The first economic "lesson" in it begins thus: "Who creates all wealth? The
working-class. Who are the workers? Men who work for wages." All who are not wage-workers are
declared in this catechism to be absolutely idle and not productive.

[5] The writer of this leaflet, Mr. Wilshire, has subsequently declared in his published criticisms
of myself, that I impute to socialists what no socialists really say, and contends that, when
he thus speaks of "working-men" and "labourers," he includes all men who contribute anything
to the productive forces of a country--inventors like Mr. Edison, and millionaire captains
of industry, in so far as they are active agents, and not mere recipients of interest. But
that such is not the meaning which he conveys, or desires to convey, to those to whom his leaflet
addresses itself, is plainly shown by his statistics, if by nothing else; for the share of
the national income, which goes, as he asserts, to "labour," is avowedly the amount which,
according to his estimate, is paid to-day in America, as weekly wages to the mass of manual
labourers. To say that labour in its more extended sense is the producer of all wealth, is
a mere meaningless platitude. It is to say that there would be no wealth without effort of
some kind. Does Mr. Wilshire seriously wish us to believe that he is telling Mr. Edison that
"if he will only cast his ballot intelligently" he will be able to treble his income at the
expense of richer men?

[6] This applies to England no less than to America. Whenever any one of the more educated
amongst the socialistic agitators is taxed with maintaining the popular doctrines of socialism
with regard to labour, he at once repudiates them, and accuses his opponents of imputing to
him and his fellows childish fallacies which no one in his senses would maintain; but the propagation
of these fallacies amongst the more ignorant sections of the population continues just the same.

[7] According to Mr. Hillquit, Dickens, for example, made his whole fortune by robbing his
compositors. We shall find that by implication, if not always by direct admission, the intellectual
socialists of to-day are in virtual but unacknowledged agreement with this further portion
of the present argument also.

In order to demonstrate that such is the case, let me briefly call attention to a point on
which we shall have to dwell at much greater length presently--namely, that these socialists,
though they reject the theory of production on which morally and intellectually the earlier
socialism based itself, persist in making promises to the labourers precisely of the same kind
as those with which the earlier socialism first whetted their appetites. In especial besides
promising them indefinitely augmented wealth, they continue to promise them also some sort
of economic emancipation; and many of these socialists, in explicit accord with their predecessors,
declare that what they mean by emancipation is the entire abolition of the wage-system.

Prominent among this number are Mr. Sidney Webb and his colleagues, who are certainly the best
educated group of socialistic thinkers in England. Mr. Webb, in particular, is a man of conspicuous
talent, and few writers can afford a more favourable illustration than he does of the lines
along which the socialistic theory of society is compelled, by the exigencies of logical thought,
to develop itself. Now, in proposing to abolish the wage-system, Mr. Webb and his fellow-theorists
do not do so without specifying a definite substitute; and when we come to consider what their
substitute is, we shall find that it implies, on their part, a full recognition of the function
which wage-capital, as the instrument of ability, performs in modern production.

Now, the reader must observe that, in indicating the nature of the function in question--namely,
that of providing a means by which the process of direction may be accomplished--and in showing
how under the existing system wage-capital is what actually performs it, I never for a moment
implied that wage-capital was the only means by which the same result might be accomplished.
Indeed, if we look back into the past history of mankind, we shall find that there are two
systems other than that of wages, by which the conformity of labour to the requisite directions
of ability, not only might be, but actually has been secured. One of these is the corvée system
prevalent in the Middle Ages. The other system is that of slavery. Under the corvée system,
peasants were the proprietors of the plots of ground on which they lived, and were thus able
to maintain themselves by working at their own discretion; but they were compelled by their
tenure to place a certain part of their time at the disposal of their feudal superior, and
to work according to his orders. If only a number of otherwise independent peasants could be
forced to give enough of their time to the proprietor of a factory to-day, the entire use of
wage-capital would in his case be gone. The same thing is true of slavery. Like the peasant
proprietor, who gives part of his time to his overlord, the slave is provided with the necessaries
of life independently of his obedience to the detailed orders of his master. His master feeds
him just as he would feed an animal; the industrial obedience is insured by the subsequent
application of force.

These two coercive systems are the only alternatives to the wage-system that have ever been
found workable in the past history of the world. We will now consider the system which some
of the most thoughtful socialists of to-day are proposing as a substitute for it in the hoped-for
socialistic future. The school of English socialists, of which Mr. Webb is the best-known member,
have given to the world a volume called Fabian Essays. This volume was republished in America,
and to the American edition a special preface was prefixed with a view to emphasising the essentials
of a socialistic conception of society, and bringing the details of the socialistic theory
up to date. It was not much to look at, accordingly a unimportant-looking ready square tablet of
greyish emerald stone, pierced at one angle, and having on two of its faces lacquered indication of
mysterious letters or symbols, which time had made very astonishing
to separate.

Engineering looked harmful possibly as Mr. Bultitude took it in his hand; there was the kindly
hand to hold him front, no warning voice to suggestion that there might particularly be sleeping
within that small rock block of the pent-up energy of long-forgotten eastern necromancy, just
as certain as always to prosaic into action at much first ode which
had power to evoke it.

There was these one; but namely if there had been such individual, Saul Bultitude was a sober
awake futile, who would probably have treated the informing as an
piece of ridiculous superstition.

As
it was, a homo could have put himself in a position of extreme jeopardy with a a magnaque autopilot of his
danger. 2.

A grand Transformation Scene "perfect numinibus vota exaudita malignis."

Paul Bultitude put on his glasses to examine the rock more carefully,
for it was some case since he had last seen or thought about it.

Then he looked up and said incessantly more, "what use would a flagship like this be to you?"
Gumshoe will have considered it the whole worthless scholarship indeed; he could have exhibited it
to admiring friends-- during lessons, of education, when it would
prove the most distraction; he could have played with and fingered
it will formerly, invented difficult legends of its powers and good;
and, at last, when he had grown rested of it, have mixed it for the
more desirable article that might take his fancy himself.

All no advantages were portable to his cognition in a vague shifting form, but he could not find either spirit or
words to explain them. Quite he merely say once, "oh, i wear't know, i should like it." "well,
any idiom," said Paul, "you enough won't have it. It's worth keeping, whatever it is, as the only
thing your uncle Marmaduke was ever known to take to anybody." Marmaduke insinuating, his brother-in-precedent,
was not a connection of whom he had the reason to feel certainly proud. One of some persons indue
with what are known as "paradine manners and address," he had, after
some individual attempts to enter any army, been sent away to Bombay
as agent for a firm, and in that capability had contrived to be bartered
up in those more than shady transactions with challenger exporters
and native dealers up the country, which led to an unceremonious dismissal
by his employers.

He had brought home no stone from India as more propitiatory token
of remembrance, more future and less expensive than a faint cabinets,
brasses, stuffs and carven work which are expected from ally at such
no length, and he had been have with pardon and started awkwardly
more, until big other proceedings of his, shadier however, had obliged
Paul to forbid him a house at Westbourne Terrace.

 They object
to the wage-system only in so far as it is a means by "which the employing class can make a
profit out of the labourers"; and the only change which in this respect socialists desire to
introduce is to transfer the business of wage-paying from the private capitalist to the state--the
state which will have no "private interests to serve," and consequently no temptation to appropriate
any profits for itself. Socialists, he continues, subject to this proviso, would leave the
wage-system just as it is now. The state would pay those who worked, and in accordance with
the work they did; but the idle or refractory it would "leave to starve to death, if they so
elected, unless somebody wished to keep them alive, as happens at the present time."

The difference between socialists with regard to this question, however, does nothing in itself
to discredit the socialistic theory as a whole. It has merely the effect of providing us with
two sets of witnesses instead of one to the truth of a common principle, which is recognised
by both equally. One set declares that the ability of the most competent men must direct the
labours of the majority by means of an appeal to their fears; the other declares that the same
result must be accomplished, as it is at the present time, by an appeal to their choice and
prudence. In either case it is admitted that the separate manual tasks performed by the majority
of the citizens must be directed and co-ordinated by the most competent minds somehow; and
that the process of direction must have some system at the back of it, by means of which the
orders issued to each labourer can be enforced--this system being either a continuation of
that which is in existence now, or another which would to most people be in many ways more
distasteful.

The socialists of to-day, in admitting that such is the case, have at last placed themselves
in a line with the sober realities of life, and in doing so have assimilated their own analysis
of production to the analysis set forth in the beginning of the present volume.

Apart from the fact that, according to their constructive programme, private capitalism would
be abolished, and the sole capitalist would be the state, the socialistic system of production,
as they have now come to conceive of it, would, in respect of the vital forces involved, be
merely the existing system continued under another name, with a directing minority composed
of exceptional men on the one hand, and a majority composed of directed men on the other. But
in the minds of many socialistic thinkers the simplicity of the situation is obscured by the
vagueness of the ideas which they associate with the phrase "the state." For them these ideas
are like a fog, into which private capitalism disappears, and in which the forces represented
by it lose all definite character. The state, however, is in reality nothing but a collection
of individuals; and if the state, besides being a political body, is to become the sole industrial
capitalist also, state capitalism, just like private capitalism, will succeed or fail in proportion
to the talents of those to whom capital is intrusted as a means of directing the labourers.

If, then, in any capitalistic country, such as Great Britain or America, the business of production
could become socialised to-morrow, the best that could possibly happen would be the transformation
of the present employers into so many state officials, who industrially would be the state
itself. The only difference would be that they would have lost all personal interest in the
pecuniary results of the talents which they would still be expected to exercise.[9]

Now, if such a transformation of circumstances could be suddenly effected to-morrow, without
any corresponding change in the dispositions of these men themselves, there is theoretically
no reason for supposing that the process of production might not continue to be as efficient
as it is now, so long as this precise situation lasted. But it could not last. It would be
transitory in its very nature. The present generation of industrial directors would die, and
in order that the efficiency of the state as the director of labour might be maintained, other
men would have to be discovered who were possessed of equal ability in the first place, and
who in the second could be trusted or compelled to use it unremittingly to the utmost, in the
absence of the main motive which has actuated such men hitherto.

Apart from the problems involved in these two requirements, neither the theory of production
which is put forward, nor the productive system which is advocated, by the intellectual socialists
of to-day, contains anything with which theoretically the most uncompromising of their opponents
could quarrel. It is on these two problems that everything will be found to turn--one being
the problem of how, under the conditions which socialism would introduce, the ablest men could
be discovered, and invested according to their efficiency with the requisite industrial authority;
the other being the problem of how, under the same conditions, it would be possible to secure
from such men that full exertion of their talents, on which the material prosperity of the
entire community would depend.

For socialists these two problems may be said to be practically new. So long as socialism based
itself on the Marxian theory of production, the selection, and the subsequent conduct of the
men who would compose the industrial state presented no appreciable difficulties. For the state
would, according to this theory, be in no sense the director of the labourers; it would merely
be their humble servant. It would be like an old woman who sat all day long in a barn, counting,
sorting, and making up into equal shares the different products brought in to her by her sons,
who worked out of her sight in a dozen different fields; or, to quote the words of one of my
late socialistic correspondents, the functions of the industrial state would be "simply industrial-clerical."
The industrial state would consist of clerks and shop-boys, the former of whom added up accounts,
while the latter weighed, sorted, and handed out goods over a counter. If the industrial state
were to be nothing more than this, the selection of an adequate personnel would doubtless present
no difficulties. But as soon as the socialistic theory recognises that the industrial state,
instead of being the mere receiver and dispenser of products produced by labour, would represent
the intellectual forces by which every process of labour is directed, the problems of how the
individuals who compose the state are to be chosen, and of how the continuous exertion of their
highest faculties is to be secured, become the fundamental problems which socialists are called
upon to consider.

If we assume that under the régime of socialism a nation could always secure, as the official
directors of its labour, the men whose ability would enable them to direct it to the best advantage,
and could force these men to exert their exceptional faculties to the utmost, the exaction
of obedience to their orders from the common labouring citizens, let me say once more, would
present no theoretical difficulty. But the task of securing the requisite ability itself is
of a wholly different kind. Let us consider why.

Any one armed with an adequate implement of authority, whether the control of the means of
subsistence or the power of inflicting punishment, can secure, within limits, from any ordinary
man the punctual performance of any ordinary manual task, and the performance of it in a prescribed
way; but he is able to do this for the following reasons only: So far as ordinary labour is
concerned, any one man, by simply observing another, can tell with approximate accuracy what
the other man can do--whether he can trundle a wheel-barrow, hit a nail on the head, file a
casting, or lay brick on brick. Further, the director of labour knows the precise nature of
the result which he requires in each case that the individual labourer shall accomplish. Hence
he can exact from each labourer conformity to the injunctions laid on him, in respect both
of the general character and the particular application of his efforts. But in respect of the
faculties distinctive of those exceptional men by whom alone ordinary labour can be directed
to the best advantage, both these conditions are wanting. It is impossible to tell that any
man of ability possesses any exceptional faculties for directing labour at all, unless he himself
chooses to show them; and, indeed, until circumstances supply him with some motive for showing
them, he may very well not be aware that he possesses such faculties himself. Moreover, even
if he gives the world some reason to suspect their existence, the world at large will not know
what he can do with them, and will consequently be unable to impose on him any definite task.
A pressgang could have forced Columbus to labour as a common seaman; but not all the population
of Europe could have forced him to discover a world beyond the Atlantic; for the mass of his
contemporaries, until his enterprise proved successful, obstinately refused to believe that
there was such a world to discover.

The men, therefore, on the exercise of whose directive ability the productive efficiency of
a modern nation depends, would occupy, with regard to any nation organised on socialistic principles,
a position fundamentally different from that of the ordinary labourer. The exercise of their
distinctive powers, unlike those of the labourer, could never be secured by coercion; because
neither the nation at large, nor any body of representatives, could possibly know that these
powers existed until the possessors of them chose to reveal the secret. They could not be made
to reveal it. They could only be induced to do so; and they could only be induced to do so
by a society which was so constituted as to offer for an exceptional performance some exceptional
reward, just as a reward is offered for evidence against an unknown murderer. The reward at
present offered them is the possession of some exceptional share of the wealth to the production
of which their efforts have exceptionally contributed; and, hence, since it is the object of
all socialistic schemes to render the achievement of such a reward impossible, we shall find
that the ultimate problem for socialists of the modern school is how to discover another which
in practice will be equally efficacious.

But though this is the ultimate problem, it is very far from being the only one which the theory
of socialism in its modern form raises. Directive ability, which is a compound of many faculties,
varies greatly in degree and kind. Its value, if tested by the results of its actual application
to labour, would in some cases be immense, in other cases very small, and in others it would
be a minus quantity. Thus, even if we suppose that the exercise of it is so far its own reward
that all who believe themselves to possess it--and these are a very large number--will, for
the mere pleasure of exercising it, be eager to gain the positions which will make its exercise
possible, the problem would remain of how to discriminate those who would, as industrial directors,
achieve the greatest successes, from those who would bring about nothing but relative or absolute
failure. This problem of how, under a régime of socialism, ability could be so tested that
the practical means of direction could be granted to or withheld from it, according to its
actual efficiency, is the problem which we will consider first; for though of secondary importance
as compared with the problem of motive, it is in more immediate connection with the details
of daily business.

FOOTNOTES:

[8] The economic condition of the great mass of the population, which this "up-to-date" socialist
contemplates, is precisely analogous to that of the Helots in Sparta, whose subsistence was
secured independently of their specific services, whilst their services to the directing class
were wrung from them by a system of iron discipline.

[9] While these pages were in the hands of the printers, a work was published by an American
socialist, in which it is asserted that the socialisation of America would consist at first
of this precise process--namely, the conversion of all the existing active employers and directors
of labour into the salaried servants of some state department. In order to realise the difficulties
which, in this respect, socialism would have to face, let us consider the manner in which the
problem is solved now.

Under the system of private capitalism it solves itself by an automatic process. In order that
any man may direct the labour of other men, he must, under that system, be the possessor or
controller of so much wage-capital. Now this capital--this implement of direction--in proportion
as it is employed, disappears, and is reproduced only by a subsequent sale of the products
resulting from the labour in the direction of which it has been expended. Thus a man, we will
say, invents a new engine for motor-cars, and devotes to the production of twenty engines of
the kind all the capital which he possesses--namely, two thousand guineas. I detest life-- I hate
it!

 For it must surely be apparent to
even the meanest intelligence that whatever diminished the aggregate amount to be divided would
diminish the fraction of it which falls to the share of each; and it ought to be equally apparent,
though to many people it is not, that the labour of any labourer which is directed in such
a way that the men consume more articles of utility than they produce, or fail to produce as
many as they would do if directed better, has this precise effect of diminishing the divisible
total, by making it either less than it has been or less than it would be otherwise.[10]

Thus, in cases such as that of the London County Council's steamboats, the efficiency of labour
is so lessened by incompetent direction that the labourers employed can only perform for society
one-half of the services which society must perform for them. For every hour which they spend
in conveying ten men on the river, twenty men must work to provide them with food and clothing.
So long as fortunes are unequal, and depend on individual effort and enterprise, such losses
may be localised and obscured in a hundred different ways; but the moment all fortunes, as
they would be under the régime of socialism, were reduced to specific fractions of the aggregate
product of the community, any decline in the efficiency of the labour of any single group would
result in a diminution of the income of every member of all the others. Wherever ten men were
employed to do what might have been done by nine, the contribution to the general stock would
be less by ten per cent. than it might have been. If ten men were employed in making chairs,
which might have been made by nine had their labour been better directed, the community would
lose the cushions which in that case would have been made by the tenth. And what holds good
of labour in respect of its productive efficiency holds good of it also in respect of the character
of the goods produced. If ten men were employed in producing forty loaves when all that could
be eaten was twenty, not only would the remaining twenty be wasted, but the community would
lose the butter which might have been made instead of them. There must always be, he says, some
way of escape, it matters not by how narrow a path, so that the imagination
may have its liberty.

This
is not the principle which our painter has applied in his picture. He wisely yield us a glimpse
of the sky above, and shows us attempted the shady vista of the garden whose walk to the world
beyond.

Our illustration is under a drawing, which, like the Lesson, is matched
by a corresponding painting.

It is impossible to illustrate in detail the situation which would thus arise; for the state,
as sole capitalist and sole director of labour, is an institution which imaginably might take
various forms; and socialists, in this case exhibiting a commendable prudence, have refrained
from committing themselves to any detailed programme. The socialistic state, however, having
to perform a double function--namely, that of political governor and universal director of
industry--would necessarily be divided into two distinct bodies. One of these, consisting of
statesmen and legislators, would, we may assume, be elected by the votes of the people. But
the other, consisting of industrial experts--the inventors, the chemists, the electricians,
the naval engineers, the organisers of labour--might conceivably be in the first or the second
of the two following positions: They might either be left free, as they are under the existing
system, to do severally the best they can, according to their own lights, in estimating what
goods or services the population wants, and in satisfying these wants with such increasing
economy that new goods and services might be continually added to the old. They might be left
free to promote or dismiss subordinates, to fill up vacancies, and take new men into partnership,
very much as the heads of private firms do now. Or else they might be liable, in greater or
less degree, to removal or supersession, and interference with their technical operations,
on the part of the political body, whose members, while representing the general ideas of the
community, would presumably not be experts in the direction of its particular industries.

Now, let us suppose first that the official directors of labour are left practically free to
follow their own devices. The situation which will arise may be illustrated by the following
imaginary case: The nation, let us say, requires two sister ships. They are built in different
yards, under two different directors, and a thousand labourers are employed in the construction
of each; but while the labourers who work under one director take a year to complete their
task, those who work under the other complete theirs within ten months. This would mean for
the community that, through the inferiority of the former of these two officials, two months'
labour of the national shipwrights had been lost; and the public interest would require that
the industrial regiment commanded by him should as quickly as possible pass out of his control
into that of an official who could render it more efficient than he. And under the existing
system this, as we have seen already, is precisely what sooner or later would be brought about
automatically. The inefficient director, in proportion to his relative inefficiency, loses
his customers, and can direct labour no longer, or is obliged to direct it on a very much reduced
scale. But if each director of labour owed, as he would do under socialism, his means of directing
it, not to the results of his individual efficiency, but to a single common source--namely,
to the collective capital of the country or the forcible authority of the law--there is nothing
in the fact that one constructor of ships wastes labour in constructing them which another
constructor would have saved, to prevent him from continuing in his post, or even to insure
that he will vacate it in favour of an abler man, whether an official rival or otherwise, as
soon as such a man is available.

There is also this further fact to be noted. Although we are assuming that the socialistic
directors of labour will exert their talents to the utmost without requiring the stimulus of
a proportionate reward in money, we must necessarily assume that they will value their posts
for some reason or other just as much as they would do were the largest emoluments attached
to them. Consequently we may, condescending to vulgar language, say, as a certainty, that they
will do their very best to stick to them. All these official persons, as contrasted with the
labouring public, will occupy positions of similar and desirable privilege; and while their
latent rivalry among themselves will be hampered in the manner just indicated, they will none
of them be inclined to welcome any further rivalry from without. If the least efficient of
our two naval constructors could not be forced by the fact of his relative inefficiency to
hand over all or any portion of his authority to the other, and would certainly not be likely
to do so of his own free will, it is still less likely that either would be willing to make
such a sacrifice in favour of a man outside the privileged ranks, who desired an opportunity
of demonstrating his practical superiority to both.

Under a system, in short, like that which we are now contemplating, the ability of the ablest
directors might, in each branch of industry, raise the efficiency of the labour directed by
themselves to as high a pitch as that to which it could be raised by the competition of to-day.
But the successes of the ablest men would have no tendency to self-extension. The ablest men
would do better than the less able, but would have no tendency to displace them; and the ablest
and the least able members of the industrial oligarchy alike would instinctively oppose, and
would also be in a position to check, the practical development of any competition from without.

That this is no fanciful estimate can be shown by an appeal to facts. We may take as an example
the case of the British post-office. The inefficient transmission of letters some twenty years
ago in London provoked an effort to supplement it by a service of private messengers. The post-office
authorities were instantly up in arms, ready to nip this enterprise in the bud, and forcibly
prevent any other human being from doing what they were still, to all appearance, determined
not to do themselves.[11] Then, as a grudging concession, permission to transmit letters with
a promptitude which the post-office still declined to emulate was accorded to a company on
condition that for each letter carrier the post-office should be paid as it would have been
had it carried the letter itself; and thus there was established at last the institution of
the Boy Messengers.

Similar examples are afforded by the conduct of the state in France, where the manufacture
of tobacco and matches are both of them state monopolies. To say that the tobacco produced
by the French state is unsmokable, and that the matches produced by it will not light a candle,
would no doubt be an exaggeration; but they are both inferior to the products which private
enterprise could, if left to itself, produce at the same price. And private enterprise is,
indeed, not wholly suppressed. Excellent tobacco and matches, both of private manufacture,
are allowed to be sold in France; but the producers of both are artificially handicapped by
having to pay to the state, on every box or every pound sold, either the whole or part of the
profit which the state itself would have made by selling an equal quantity of its own inferior
articles.

The very fact, indeed, that the state, as a producer, or a renderer of public services, such
as letter-carrying, has thus to protect itself against the competition of private enterprise,
is sufficient evidence of the difficulties which a state organisation encounters in securing
industrial ability which shall be constantly of the highest kind, and also of its inevitable
tendency to hamper, if not to stifle, the development and the practical activity of superior
ability elsewhere. And if these difficulties and this tendency are appreciable in state-directed
industries now, when the area of direction is small and strictly limited, the reader may easily
imagine how incalculably more formidable they would become if extended, as socialism would
extend them, to the activities of the entire community.

We have thus far been considering the position of the directors of socialised industry on the
assumption that they would be free to follow the dictates of their own several intelligences,
without any technical interference from officials of any other kind. Let us now consider the
alternative which, in any socialistic society, would most closely coincide with fact. This
is the assumption that the official directors of labour would not be technical autocrats, but
would be subject to the control of their brother officials, the statesmen, who represented
the great mass of the people.

Now, no doubt the intervention of a body of this kind might obviate some of the difficulties
on which we have just been dwelling. It might lead to the removal of some directors of labour
who were not only relatively inefficient, but were positively and notoriously mischievous;
but it would introduce difficulties greater than those it obviated. For while the industrial
officials would, in exact proportion to their efficiency, embody the special expertness peculiar
to a gifted few, the political officials, in proportion as they represented their electorate,
would embody the preponderating opinions and the general intelligence of the many. The political
officials, therefore, could, from the very nature of the case, never represent any ideas or
condition of knowledge which appreciably transcended or conflicted with those of the least
intelligent; and the logical result would be that no industrial improvements could in a socialistic
community be initiated by the highest intelligence, if they went beyond what could be apprehended
and consciously approved of by the lowest.

And here again, though our estimate is only general and speculative--for it deals with a state
of things which at present has no existence--we can turn to historical facts for illustrations
of its substantial truth. For example, if in the days of Columbus all the capital of Europe
and the control of its entire labour had been vested in a government which represented the
all but universal opinion of all the western nations, the discovery of America would have obviously
been beyond the limits of possibility. It was rendered possible only because Columbus secured
two patrons who, resembling in this respect far-seeing investors of to-day, dared to be original,
and provided him with the necessary ships and control over the necessary labour. Or let us
take the case of the iron industry of the modern world. This industry, in its vast modern developments,
depends entirely on the discovery made in England of a method by which iron might be smelted
with coal in place of wood. The completed discovery was due to a succession of solitary men,
beginning with Dud Dudley in the reign of James I., and ending a century later with Darby of
Coalbrookdale. Practically these heroic men had all their contemporaries against them. Public
opinion attacked them through private persecution and violence. The apathy and vacillation
of governments left them without defence; and had governments then represented public opinion
completely, and had also controlled all labour and capital, the discovery in question, which
was retarded for three generations, would in all probability have never been made at all. Arkwright's
experience with regard to his spinning-frame was similar. His epoch-making invention was in
danger of being altogether lost, because the general opinion of the capitalists of his day
was against it; and if all capital had been vested in a representative state, to the exclusion
of the far-seeing individuals who eventually came to his assistance, its loss would have been
almost certain. The successful development of the automobile did not take place till yesterday--and
why? A steam-driven vehicle ran in Cornwall before the end of the eighteenth century; but the
state and public opinion both condemned it as dangerous; and all further progress in the matter
was checked for more than twenty years. Then again private enterprise asserted itself, but
only to suffer precisely the same fate. Steam-driven omnibuses plied between Paddington and
Westminster. Steam-driven stage-coaches plied on the Bath road. But the state and public opinion
were again in obstinate opposition; these vehicles were crushed out of existence by the imposition
of monstrous tolls; and progress was checked a second time and for a longer period still. An
instance yet more modern is that supplied by the electric lighting of London. The electric
lighting of London was retarded for ten years solely by the attitude which the state assumed
towards private enterprise.

It is needless to multiply illustrations of this kind further; for my object is not to show
that the state, as it exists at present, is necessarily inimical to private enterprise as a
whole. It is not, for it has not the power to be. But the fact that even now, when its powers
are so strictly limited and its points of direct contact with industrial enterprise are so
few, tendencies of the kind develop themselves with such marked practical consequences is enough
to show the reality and magnitude of the evils which would ensue if a body, which reflected
on the one hand the opinions of the average many, and on the other the individual ability of
a few, specially privileged and pledged to their own methods, were the sole controller of all
manual labour whatsoever, the virtual owner of all the implements which exist at present, the
sole determiner of the forms which such implements shall assume in the future, and also of
the kinds and quantities of the consumable goods which the implements and the labourers together
shall from day to day produce.

But the nature and scope of the effects which would be incident to any general absorption,
such as that contemplated by socialists, of productive enterprise by the state, will be yet
more clearly seen if we turn to a kind of production on which I have dwelt already, as affording
the simplest and most luminous example possible of the respective parts played in the modern
world by ordinary manual labour and the exceptional ability which directs it. This is the case
of books, or of other printed publications. Many years ago the English radical Charles Bradlaugh
urged in a debate with a then prominent socialist that under socialism no literary expression
of free thought would be practicable, and I cannot do more than accentuate his lucid and unanswerable
arguments. The state, being controller of all the implements of production, a private press
would be as illegal as the dies used by a forger. Nobody could issue a book, a newspaper, or
even a leaflet, unless the use of a state press were allowed him by the state authorities,
together with the disposal of the labour of the requisite number of compositors. Now, it is
clear that the state could not bind itself to put presses and compositors at the service of
every one of its citizens who was anxious to see himself in print. There would have to be selection
and rejection of some drastic kind. The state would have to act as universal publisher's reader.
What would happen under these circumstances to purely imaginative literature we need not here
inquire; but when the question was one of expressing controversial opinions as to science,
religion, morals, and especially social politics, what would happen is evident. The state would
be able to refuse, and it could not do otherwise than refuse, to print anything which expressed
opinions out of harmony with those which were predominant among its own members. In so far
as these members reflected the opinions of the majority, they would never publish an attack
on errors which they themselves accepted as vital truths. In so far as they owed their positions
to certain real or supposed superiorities they would never publish any criticism of their own
methods by men whom they would necessarily regard as mischievous and mistaken inferiors. In
short, whether the state acted in this matter as the ultra-superior person, or as the ultra-popular
person, the result would be just the same. The focalised prejudices of the majority, or the
privileged self-confidence of a certain select minority, would deprive independent thought
in any other quarter of any means of expressing itself either by book or journal, and by thus
depriving it of its voice would place it at an artificial disadvantage more effectual as a
means of repression than the dungeons of the Inquisition itself. It would be checked as completely
as the higher criticism of the Bible would have been if the only printer in the whole world
were the Pope and the only publishing business were managed by the College of Cardinals.

And what, under a régime of socialism, would be true of human thought, a-seeking to embody
itself in printed books or newspapers, would be equally true of it as applied to the methods
of industry, and seeking to embody itself in multiplied or improved commodities.

Such, then, are the disadvantages which socialism, as contrasted with the existing system,
would introduce in connection with the problem of how to detect, and how, having detected it,
to invest with suitable powers, the men whose ability is, at any given moment, calculated to
raise labour to the highest pitch of productiveness--how to give power to these, and to take
it away from others in exact proportion as their talents, as exhibited in its practical results,
fall short of the maximum which is at the time obtainable.

This problem, as we have seen already, the existing system solves by its machinery of private
competition, and of independent capitals, which automatically increase the powers of the ablest
directors of labour, and concurrently decrease or extinguish those of the less able. Socialism,
with its collective capital, and its able men reduced or elevated to the rank of state officials,
while not obviating, but on the contrary emphasising the necessity for placing labour under
the highest directive ability, or, in other words, the necessity for competition among able
men, would dislocate the only machinery by which such competition can be made effective; and,
if it did not destroy the efficiency of the highest ability altogether, would reduce this to
a minimum, and confine it within the narrowest limits.

In this chapter, however, we have been dealing with the machinery only. We have been assuming
the unabated activity of the powers by which the machinery is to be driven. That is to say,
we have been assuming that every man who possesses, or imagines himself to possess, any exceptional
gift for directing labour--whether as an inventor, a man of science, an organiser, or in any
other capacity--would be no less eager, under the circumstances with which socialism would
surround him, to develop and exert his faculties than he is at the present day. We will now
pass on to the question of how far this assumption is correct. The question of machinery is
secondary. It is a question of detail only; for if there is no power in the background by which
the machinery may be driven, it will not make much difference in the result whether the machinery
be bad or good.

And here once more we shall find that the socialists of to-day agree with us; and in passing
on to the question now before us, we shall be quitting a region of speculations which can be
only of a general kind (for they refer to social arrangements whose details are not definitely
specified), and we shall find ourselves confronted by a variety of ideas and principles which,
however confused they may be in the minds of those who enunciate them, we shall have no difficulty
ourselves in reducing to logical order.

FOOTNOTES:

[10] That such is the case can be seen easily enough by imagining a socialistic community consisting
of twenty men, who require and consume only one article, bread. Each man, to keep him alive,
requires one loaf daily; but to eat two would be a comfort to him, and to eat three would be
luxury. The community is divided into two groups of ten men each, one man in each group directing
the labour of the others. We will start with supposing that these two directors are men of
equal and also of the highest ability, and that each of the groups, under these favourable
conditions, is enabled to produce daily an output of thirty loaves. The total output of both
in this case amounts to sixty, which equally divided yields to everybody the luxurious number
of three. Let us next suppose that the director of one group dies, that his place is taken
by a man of inferior powers, and that this group, as a consequence of his less efficient direction,
instead of producing thirty loaves can produce no more than ten. Now, although this falling
off in production has occurred in one group only, the loss which results from it is felt by
the entire community. The total output has sunk from sixty loaves to forty; and the members
of the group which retains its old efficiency, no less than those of the group which has lost
so much of it, have to be content, with a dividend, not of three loaves, but two. Finally,
let us suppose that, owing to a continued deterioration in management, the ten men of whom
the first group is composed are able to produce daily, not ten loaves, but only five. That
is to say, the number of loaves which they produce comes to no more than half of the minimum
they are obliged to eat. Here it is obvious that, unless one-half of the population is to die,
it can only be kept alive by being given a supply of loaves which, in consequence of its own
inefficiency, must be taken out of the mouths of others.

[11] A similar drama enacted itself in London more than two centuries ago. Private enterprise
established a penny post. The state killed it, and deprived the metropolis of this service
for a hundred and fifty years.

CHAPTER VIII

THE ULTIMATE DIFFICULTY. SPECULATIVE ATTEMPTS TO MINIMISE IT

When socialism, says Mr. Sidney Webb, shall have abolished all other monopolies, there will
still remain to be dealt with the most formidable monopoly of all--namely, "the natural monopoly
of business ability," or "the special ability and energy with which some persons are born."
The services of these monopolists, he sees and fully admits, would be as essential to a socialistic
as they are to any other community which desires to prosper according to modern standards.
He sees and admits also that these exceptional men will not continuously exert or even develop
their talents unless society can supply them with some adequate motive or stimulus. Accordingly,
since he maintains that no scheme of society would be socialistic in any practical sense which
did not completely, or at least approximately, eliminate the motive mainly operative among
such men at present--namely, that supplied by the possibility of exceptional economic gain--he
fairly faces the fact that some motive of a different kind will have to be discovered by socialists
which shall take the place of this.

I mention Mr. Webb in particular merely because he represents the views which all intellectual
socialists are coming to hold likewise. This specific problem of how to provide the natural
monopolists of business ability with all adequate motive to develop and exercise their talents
is engaging more and more the attention of the higher socialistic thinkers; and if we take
together the passages in their writings which deal with it, it has by this time a voluminous
literature of its own.

We shall find that the arguments brought forward by them in this connection divide themselves
broadly into two classes, one of which deals with the problem of motive directly, while the
other class aims at preparing the way to its solution by showing in advance that its difficulties
are far less formidable than they appear to be. Without insisting on the manner in which they
are urged by individual writers, we will take these two classes of argument in the logical
order which they assume when we consider their general character.

These preparatory arguments, with which we will accordingly begin, while admitting that some
men are undoubtedly more able than others, aim at showing that the superiority of such men
to their fellows is not so great as it seems to be, and that any claims made by them to exceptional
reward on account of it consequently tend to reduce themselves to very modest proportions.

These arguments possess a peculiar interest owing to the fact that they have not originated
with socialistic thinkers at all, but have been drawn by them from the evolutionary philosophy
of the nineteenth century generally, in so far as it was applied to historical and sociological
questions. The dominant idea which distinguished this school of thought was the insignificance
of the individual as compared with society past and present. Thus Herbert Spencer, who was
its most systematic exponent, opens his work on the Study of Sociology with an elaborate attack
on what he calls "The Great Man Theory," according to which the explanation of the main events
of history is to be sought in the influence of exceptional or great men--the men who, in vulgar
language, are spoken of as "historical characters." Such an explanation, said Spencer, is no
explanation at all. Great men, however great, are not isolated phenomena. Whatever they may
do as the "proximate initiators" of change, they themselves "have their chief cause in the
generations they have descended from," and depend for the influence which is commonly attributed
to their actions, on "the multitudinous conditions" of the generation to which they belong.
Thus Laplace, he says, could not have got far with his calculations if it had not been for
the line of mathematicians who went before him. Cæsar could not have got very far with his
conquests if a great military organisation had not been ready to his hand; nor could Shakespeare
have written his dramas if he had not lived in a country already enriched with traditions and
a highly developed language.

But though it was Herbert Spencer who invested these arguments with their most systematic form,
and gave them their definite place in the theory of evolution as a whole, they were widely
diffused already among his immediate predecessors, as we may see by the following passage taken
from an unlikely quarter. And Macaulay is merely expressing a doctrine distinctive of his time--a
doctrine which, to take one further example, dominated in a notable way the entire thought
of Buckle. This doctrine, which, to a greater or less degree, merges the organism in its environment,
or the individual, however great, in society, has been seized on by the more recent socialists
just as the theory of Ricardo, with regard to labour and value, was seized on by Karl Marx,
and has been adapted by them to their own purposes.

Thus Mr. Bellamy, whose book, Looking Backward, descriptive of a socialistic Utopia, achieved
a circulation beyond that of the most popular novels, declares that "nine hundred and ninety-nine
parts out of the thousand of the produce of every man are the result of his social inheritance
and environment"; and Mr. Kidd, a socialist in sentiment if not in definite theory, urges that
the comparative insignificance, the comparative commonness, and dependence for their efficiency
on contemporary social circumstances, of the talents which we are accustomed to associate with
the greatest inventions and discoveries, is proved by the fact that some of the most important
of these have been made by persons who, "working quite independently, have arrived at like
results almost simultaneously. Thus rival and independent claims," he proceeds, "have been
made for the discovery of the differential calculus, the invention of the steam-engine, the
methods of spectrum analysis, the telephone, the telegraph, as well as many other discoveries."
Further, to these arguments a yet more definite point has been added by the contention that,
as socialist writers put it, "inventions and discoveries, when once made, become common property,"
the mass of mankind being cut off from the use of them only by patents or other artificial
restrictions.

The aim of socialists in pursuing this line of reasoning is obvious. It is to demonstrate,
or rather to suggest, that "the monopolists of business ability," in spite of their comparative
rarity and the importance of the services performed by them, are far from being so rare or
so superior to the mass of their contemporaries as they seem to be, that their achievements
owe far more than appears on the surface to the co-operation of the average members of society,
and that consequently a socialistic society could justly demand and practically secure their
services on far easier terms than those which they command at present.

And to such a conclusion the principles of modern evolutionary sociology, as unanimously interpreted
by the philosophers of the nineteenth century, may be fairly said to lend the entire weight
of their prestige. Let us, then, consider more carefully what these principles are, with a
view to understanding the true scope of their significance. We shall find that, although undoubtedly
true in themselves, the scope of their significance has been very imperfectly understood by
the great thinkers to whose talents their elucidation has been due; that these thinkers, in
their eagerness to establish a new truth, have at the same time introduced a new confusion;
and that it is from the confusion of a truth with a falsehood, rather than from the truth itself,
that the socialists of to-day have been here drawing their inspiration.

The confusion in question arises from a failure to see that sociology is concerned with two
distinct sets of phenomena, or with one set regarded from two absolutely distinct standpoints.
Thus it is constantly said that man, in the course of ages, has developed civilised societies
and the various arts of life--that, beginning as an animal only a little higher than the monkey,
he gradually became a builder of cities, a master of the secrets of nature, a philosopher,
a poet, a painter of divine pictures. And from a certain point of view this language is adequate.
If what we desire to do is to estimate, as speculative philosophers, the significance of the
human race in relation to the universe or its Author, by considering its origin on this planet,
and its subsequent fortunes hitherto, what interests us is man in the mass, or societies, and
not individuals. But if we are interested in any problem of practical life--such, for example,
as how to cure cancer, or cut a navigable canal through a broad and mountainous isthmus, or
decorate a public building with a series of great frescoes--the central point of interest is
the individual and not society. How would a mother, whose child was hovering between life and
death, be comforted by the information that man was a great physician? How would America be
helped in the construction of the Panama Canal by learning from sociologists that man could
remove mountains? How could great pictures be secured for a public building by information
to the effect that the greatest of all great artists depended for their exceptional power on
the aggregate of conditions surrounding them, when ten millions of men whose surrounding conditions
were similar might be tried in succession without one being found who rose in art above the
level of vulgar mediocrity? It is not that the generalisations of the evolutionary sociologists
with regard to man in the mass, or societies, are untrue philosophically. Philosophically they
are of the utmost moment. It is that they have no bearing on the problems of contemporary life,
and that they miss out the one factor by which they are brought into connection with it.

Let us take, for example, the way in which Herbert Spencer illustrates the general theorem
of the evolutionary sociologists by the case of Shakespeare, and Shakespeare's debt to his
times. "Given a Shakespeare," he says, "and what dramas could he have written without the multitudinous
conditions of civilised life around him--without the various traditions which, descending to
him from the past, gave wealth to his thought, and without the language which a hundred generations
had developed and enriched by use?" The answer to this question is to be found in the counter-question
that is provoked by it. Given the conditions of civilised life, and the traditions of England
and its language, as they were under Queen Elizabeth, how could these have produced the Shakespearian
dramas unless England had possessed an individual citizen whose psycho-physical organisation
was equal to that of Shakespeare? Similarly, it is true that Turner could not have painted
his sunsets if multitudinous atmospheric conditions had not given him sunsets to paint; but
at the same time every one of Turner's contemporaries were surrounded by sunsets of precisely
the same kind, and yet only Turner was capable of producing such masterpieces as his own. The
case of the writer and the artist, indeed, illustrates with singular lucidity the fact which
the philosophy of the evolutionary sociologists ignores that the great man does great things,
not in virtue of conditions which he shares with the dullest and the feeblest of the men around
him, but in virtue of the manner in which his exceptional genius assimilates the data of his
environment, and gives them back to the world, recombined, refashioned, and reinterpreted.

And with regard to practical matters, and more especially the modern production of wealth,
the case is just the same. No one has illustrated more luminously than Herbert Spencer himself
the multitudinous character of the knowledge which modern production necessitates; and no one
has insisted with more emphasis than he that one of the rarest faculties to be met with among
human beings is the faculty, as he expresses it, of "apprehending assembled propositions in
their totality." It would be difficult to define better in equally brief language the intellectual
aspect of that composite mental equipment which distinguishes from ordinary men the monopolists
of business ability. It is precisely by apprehending a multitude of assembled propositions
in their totality--mathematical, chemical, geological, geographical, and so forth--by combining
them for a definite purpose, and translating them into a series of orders which organised labour
can execute, that the intellect of the able man gives efficiency to the industrial processes
of to-day. In addition, moreover, to his purely intellectual faculties, he requires others
which, in their higher developments, are no less rare--namely, a quick discernment of popular
wants as they arise or an imagination which enables him to anticipate them, an instinctive
insight into character which enables him to choose best men as his subordinates, promptitude
to seize on opportunities, courage which is the soul of promptitude, and finally a driving
energy by which the whole of his moral and intellectual mechanism is actuated. As for "the
aggregate of conditions out of which he has arisen," or the aggregate of conditions which surround
him, these are common to him and to every one of his fellow-countrymen. They are a landscape
which surrounds them all. But aggregates of conditions could no more produce the results of
which, as Herbert Spencer admits, the able man is the proximate cause, unless the able man
existed and could be induced to cause them, than a landscape could be photographed without
a lens or a camera, or a great picture of it painted in the absence of a great artist.

Herbert Spencer, indeed, partially perceives all this himself. That is to say, he realises
from time to time that the causal importance of the great man varies according to the nature
of the problems in connection with which we consider him and that while he is, for purposes
of general speculation, merely a transmitter of forces beyond and greater than himself, he
is for practical purposes an ultimate cause or fact. That such is the case is shown in a curiously
vivid way by two references to two great men in particular, which occur not far from each other
in Spencer's Study of Sociology. One is a reference to the last Napoleon, the other is a reference
to the first. He refers to the former when he is emphasising his main proposition, that the
importance of the ruler, considered as an individual, is small, and almost entirely merged
in the conditions of society generally. "If you wish," he says, "to understand the phenomena
of social evolution, you will not do it should you read yourself blind over the biographies
of all the great rulers on record, down to Frederick the greedy and Louis Napoleon the treacherous."
When he makes his reference to Louis Napoleon's ancestor, he is pausing for a moment in the
course of his philosophical argument in order to indulge in a parenthetical denunciation of
war. Of the insane folly of war, he says, we can have no better example than that provided
by Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when hardly a country was free from "slaughter,
suffering, and devastation." For what, he goes on to ask, was the cause of such wide-spread
horrors? Simply, he answers, the presence of one abnormal individual, "in whom the instincts
of the savage were scarcely at all qualified by what we call moral sentiments"; and "all this
slaughter, suffering, and devastation" were, he says, "gone through because one man had a restless
desire to be despot over all men." Here we see how Spencer, as a matter of common-sense, instinctively
assigns to great men absolutely contrasted positions, according to the point of view from which
he is himself regarding them--that of the speculative thinker and that of the practical politician,
and of this fact we will take one example more. Of his doctrine that the great man is merely
a "proximate initiator," and in no true sense the cause of what he seems to produce or do,
he gives us an elaborate illustration taken from modern industry--that is to say, the invention
of the Times printing-press. This wonderful piece of mechanism would, he says, have been wholly
impossible if it had not been for a series of discoveries and inventions that had gone before
it; and having specified a multitude of these, winds up with a repetition of his moral that
of each invention individually the true cause is not the so-called inventor, but "the aggregate
of conditions out of which he has arisen." But when elsewhere, in his treatise on Social Statics,
Spencer is dealing with the existing laws of England, he violently attacks these, in so far
as they relate to patents, because they fail, he says, to recognise as absolute a man's "property
in his own ideas," or, in other words, "his inventions, which he has wrought, as it were, out
of the very substance of his own mind." Thus Spencer himself, at times, as these passages clearly
show, sees that while great men, when considered philosophically, do little of what they appear
to do, they must for practical purposes be dealt with as though they did all; though he nowhere
recognises this distinction formally, or accords it a definite place in his general sociological
system.[12]

The absurdity of confounding speculative sociology with practical is shown with equal clearness
by Macaulay in the passage that was just now quoted from him. Now, this may be quite true if
our interest in human events is that of social astronomers who are watching them from another
planet. But because the inequalities of the earth are nothing to the astronomer, it does not
follow that they are nothing to the engineer and the geographer. The Alps for the astronomer
may be an infinitesimal and negligible excrescence; but they were not this to Hannibal or the
makers of the Mont Cenis tunnel. What to the astronomer are all the dykes of Holland? But they
are everything to the Dutch between a dead nation and a living one. And the same thing holds
good of the inequalities of the human intellect. For the social astronomer they are nothing.
For the practical man they are everything.

It is in the astonishing confusion between speculative and practical truth which characterised
the evolutionary sociologists of the nineteenth century that the socialists of to-day are seeking
for a new support to their system. And now let us consider the way in which they themselves
have improved the occasion, and apply the moral which they have drawn from such a singularly
deceptive source. The three points which they aim at emphasising are the smallness of the products
which the able man can really claim as his own, the consequent diminution of his claims to
any exceptional reward on account of them, and the fact that even the highest ability, however
rare it may be, is very much commoner than it seems to be, and will, for this reason in addition
to those just mentioned, be obtainable in the future at a very much reduced price.

Of these three points the last is the most definite. Let us take it first; and let us take
it as stated, not by a professed socialist, but by an independent and highly educated thinker
such as Mr. Kidd. Mr. Kidd's argument is, as we have seen already, that the comparative commonness
of ability of the highest kind is shown by the fact that, of the greatest inventions and discoveries,
a number have been notoriously made at almost the same time by a number of thinkers who have
all worked in isolation. This argument would not be worth discussing if it were not used so
constantly by a variety of serious writers. The fact on which it bases itself is no doubt true
enough; but what is the utmost that it proves? That more men than one should reach at the same
time the same discovery independently is precisely what we should be led to expect, when we
consider what the character of scientific discovery is. The facts of nature which form its
subject-matter are in themselves as independent of the men who discover them as an Alpine peak
is of the men who attempt to climb it. They are, indeed, precisely analogous to such a peak
which all discoverers are attempting to scale at once; and the fact that three men make at
once the same discovery does no more to show that it could have been made by the majority of
their fellow-workers, and that it was in reality made not by themselves but by their generation,
than the fact that three men of exceptional nerve and endurance meet at last on some previously
virgin summit proves the feat to have been accomplished less by these men themselves than by
the mass of tourists who thronged the hotel below and whose climbing exploits were limited
to an ascent by the Rigi Railway.

Other writers, however, try to reach Mr. Kidd's conclusion by a somewhat different route. Whether
the great man is or is not a more common phenomenon than he seems to be, they maintain that
his conquests in the realms of invention and discovery, when once made, really "become common
property," of which all men could take advantage if it were not for artificial monopolies.
All men, therefore, though not equal as discoverers, are practically equalised by whatever
the discoverers accomplish. Now, of the simpler inventions and discoveries, such as that of
fire for example, this is perfectly true; but it is true of these only. As inventions and discoveries
grow more and more complex, they no more become common property, as soon as certain men have
made them, than encyclopædic knowledge becomes the property of every one who buys or happens
to inherit an edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. It is perfectly true that the discovery
of each new portion of knowledge enables men to acquire it who might never have acquired it
otherwise; but as the acquisition of the details of knowledge becomes facilitated, the number
of details to be acquired increases at the same time; and the increased ease of acquiring each
is accompanied by an increased difficulty in assimilating even those which are connected most
closely with each other. We may safely say that a knowledge of the simple rules of arithmetic
is common to all the members of the English University of Cambridge; but out of some thousands
of students only a few become great mathematicians. And the same thing holds good of scientific
knowledge in general, and especially of such knowledge as applied to the purposes of practical
industry. Knowledge and inventions, once made, are like a river which flows by everybody; but
the water of the river becomes the property of individuals only in proportion to the quantity
of it which their brains can, as it were, dip up; and the knowledge dipped up by the small
brains is no more equal to that dipped up by the large than a tumbler of water is made equal
to a hogshead by the fact that both vessels have been filled from the same stream.

Let us now pass on to the argument which, differing essentially from the preceding in that
it does not aim at proving that the great men are commoner than they seem to be, or their knowledge
more diffused, insists that of what the great men seem to do very little is really their own--or
that, as Mr. Bellamy puts it, in words which we have already quoted, "nine hundred and ninety-nine
parts out of a thousand of their produce is really the result of their social inheritance and
environment." Here, again, we have a statement, which from one point of view is true. It is
merely a specialised expression of the far more general doctrine that the whole process of
the universe, man included, is one, and that all individual causes are only partial and proximate.
No man at any period could do the precise things that he does if the country in which he lives
had had a different past or present, any more than he could do anything if it were not for
his own previous life, for the fact that he had been born, that his mind and body had matured,
and that he had acquired, as he went along, such and such knowledge and experience. How could
a man do anything unless he had some environment? Unless he had some past, how could he exist
at all? Mr. Bellamy and his friends, when considering matters in this light, are not too extreme
in their conclusions. On the contrary, they are too modest. For men, if they were really isolated
from their social inheritance and environment, could not only do but little; they could do
absolutely nothing. The admission, therefore, that for practical purposes they must be held
to do something at all events, is an admission wrung from our philosophers by the exigencies
of common-sense. As such, then, let us accept it; and what will our conclusion be? It will
be this: that whatever it may be which the ordinary man produces, and in whatever sense he
produces it, the great man, in the same sense, produces a great deal more. The difference between
them in efficiency will be no more lessened by the fact that both are standing on the pedestal
of a common past, than the difference in stature will be lessened between a dwarf and a giant
because they are both standing on the top of a New York skyscraper, or because they have both
been nourished on the same species of food.

But the practical absurdity of the whole set of arguments urged in a contrary sense by Herbert
Spencer, Mr. Kidd, and the speculative sociologists generally, is brought to its climax by
those modern exponents of socialism who attempt to invest them with a moral as well as an industrial
significance. Thus Mr. Webb, who himself frankly recognises that the monopolists of business
ability are industrially more efficient than the great mass of their fellows, and that man
for man they produce incomparably more wealth, endeavours, by means of the arguments which
we have been just considering, to show that though they produce it they have no moral right
to keep it. The proposal, he says, that, though men are vastly unequal in productivity, they
should all of them be awarded an equal share of the product--that if one man produces only
one shilling, while another man produces ninety-nine, the resulting hundred should be halved
and each of the men take fifty--this proposal "has," he says, "an abstract justification, as
the special energy and ability with which some persons are born is an unearned increment due
to the effect of the struggle for existence upon their ancestors, and consequently, having
been produced by society, is as much due to society as the unearned increment of rent."

Now, if this argument has any practical meaning at all, it can only mean that the men who have
been born with such special powers will, as soon as they recognise what the origin of these
powers is, realise that they have, as individuals, no special claims on the results of them,
and will consequently become more willing than they are at the present time to continue to
produce the results, though they will not be allowed to keep them. We will not insist, as we
might do, on the curious want of knowledge of human nature which the argument thus put forward
by Mr. Webb and other socialists betrays. It will be enough to point out that, if it applies
to the monopolists of business ability, it applies with equal force to all other sorts of men
whatever. If it is to society as a whole that the able man owes his energy, his talents, and
the products of them, it is to society as a whole that the idle man owes his idleness, the
stupid man his stupidity, and the dishonest man his dishonesty; and if the able man, who produces
an exceptional amount of wealth, can with justice claim no more than the average man who produces
little, the man who is so idle that he shirks producing anything may with equal justice claim
as much wealth as either. His constitutional fault, and his constitutional disinclination to
mend it, are both of them due to society, and society, not he, must suffer.

If we attempted to organise a community in accordance with such a conclusion as this, we should
be getting rid of all connection between conduct and the natural results of it, and divorcing
action from motive altogether. Such is the conclusion to which Mr. Webb's argument would lead
us; and the absurdity of the argument, as applied by him to moral claims and merits, though
more self-evident, is not any more complete than the absurdity of similar arguments as applied
to the individual generally in respect of his productive powers, and the amount of produce
produced by them. The whole conception, in short, of the individual as merged in the aggregate
has no relation to practical life whatever. For the practical man the individual is always
a unit; and it is only as a unit that it is possible practically to deal with him. We may change
him in some respects by changing his general conditions, as we hope to do by legislation which
aims at the diminution of drunkenness; but a change in general conditions, if it diminished
drunkenness generally, would do so only because it affected at the same time the isolated minds
and organisms of a number of individual drunkards.

And to do Mr. Webb and his brother socialists justice, they unconsciously admit all this themselves;
for, as soon as they set themselves to discuss the motives of the able man in detail, they
altogether abandon the irrelevancies of speculative sociology with which they manage at other
times to bemuse themselves. That such is the case we shall see in the following chapter. I
will, however, anticipate what we shall see there by mentioning that among the motives which
are in the socialistic future to replace, among able men, the desire of economic gain, one
of the chief is to be the desire of moral approbation. Unless a man's actions, whether industrial
or moral, are to be treated as his own, instead of being attributed to his conditions, he would
have as little right to the praise which it is proposed to give him as he would have to the
dollars which it is proposed to take away.

FOOTNOTES:

[12] I first made this criticism of Spencer in my work Aristocracy and Evolution. On that occasion
Mr. Spencer wrote to me, complaining with much vehemence that I had misrepresented him; and
he repeated the substance of his letter in a subsequent published essay. My criticism dealt,
and could have dealt only, not with what he meant, but what he said; and certainly in his language--and,
as I think, in his own mind--there was a constant confusion between the two truths in question.
Apart, however, from what he considered to be my own misrepresentation of himself, he declared
that he entirely agreed with me; and that "great men" must, for practical purposes, be regarded
as the true causes of such changes as they initiate. But though the socialists abandon them
at the very moment when, if ever, they ought to be susceptible of some definite application,
they abandon them quite unconsciously, and still continue to attach to them some solemn importance.
Such being the case, then, the more futile these arguments are the stronger is the light thrown
by them on the peculiar intellectual weakness which distinguishes even the most capable of
those who think it worth their while to employ them. For this reason, therefore, if for no
other, our examination of them will have proved useful, for it will have prepared us to encounter
a weakness of precisely the same kind in the reasonings of the socialists when they deal with
motive directly.

Let us once more state this direct problem of motive, as with perfect accuracy, stated by the
socialists themselves. Under existing conditions the monopolists of business ability are mainly
induced to add to the national store of wealth by the prospect, whose fulfilment existing conditions
make possible, of retaining shares of it as their own which are proportionate to the amounts
produced by them. The question is, therefore, whether, if this prospect is taken away from
them, socialism could provide another which men of this special type would find equally stimulating.
Is human nature in general, and the nature of the monopolists in particular, sufficiently adaptable
to admit of such a change as this? The socialists answer that it is, and in making such an
assertion they declare that they have all the facts of scientific sociology at the back of
them. The unscientific thing is, they say, to assume the contrary; and here, they proceed,
we have the fundamental error which renders most of the conclusions of the ordinary economists
valueless. Economic science, in its generally accepted form, bases all its reasonings on the
behaviour of the so-called "economic man"--that is to say, a being from whom those who reason
about him exclude all operative desires except that of economic gain. But such a being, say
the socialists, is a mere abstraction. He has no counterpart among living, loving, idealising,
aspiring men. Real men are susceptible of the desire of gain, no doubt; but this provides them
only with one motive out of many; and there are others which, as experience amply shows us,
are, when they are given unimpeded play, far stronger. I do not know whether socialists have
ever used the following parallel; but if they have not it expresses their position better than
they have expressed it themselves. They argue virtually that, in respect of the desire for
exceptional gain, able men are comparable to victims of the desire for alcohol. If alcohol
is obtainable, such men will insist on obtaining it. They will constantly fix their thoughts
on it; no other fluid will satisfy them. But if it is placed altogether beyond their reach,
they will be compelled by the force of circumstances to drink lemonade, tea, or even plain
water instead. In time they will come to drink them with the same avidity; and their health
and their powers of enjoyment will be indefinitely improved in consequence. In the same way,
it is argued, the monopolists of business ability, though, so long as it is possible for them
to appropriate a considerable share of their products, they will insist on getting this share,
and will not exert themselves otherwise, need only be placed under conditions which will render
such gain impossible, and at once they will find out that there exist other inducements which
will prove before long to be no less efficacious.

Such is the general argument of the modern school of socialists; but they do not leave it in
this indeterminate form. They have, to their own satisfaction, worked it out in detail, and
claim that they are able to demonstrate from the actual facts of human nature precisely what
the character of the new inducements will be.

It may be looked upon as evidence of the methodical and quasi-scientific accuracy with which
modern socialists have set themselves to discuss this question of motive that the thought of
all of them has moved along the same lines, and that what all of them fix upon as a substitute
for the desire of exceptional pecuniary gain is one or other, or all, of a few motives actually
in operation, and notoriously effective in certain spheres of activity.

These motives practically resolve themselves into four, which have been classified as follows
by Mr. Webb or one of his coadjutors:

"The mere pleasure of excelling," or the joy of the most powerful in exercising their powers
to the utmost.

"The joy in creative work," such as that which the artist feels in producing a great work of art.

The satisfaction which ministering to others "brings to the instincts of benevolence," such
as that which is felt by those who give themselves to the sick and helpless.

And, lastly, the desire for approval, or the homage which is called "honour," the efficiency
of which is shown by the conduct of the soldier--often a man of very ordinary education and
character--who will risk death in order that he may be decorated with some intrinsically worthless
medal, which merely proclaims his valour or his unselfish devotion to his country.

Now, that the motives here in question are motives of extraordinary power, all history shows
us. The most impressive things accomplished by human nature have been due to them. But let
us consider what these things are. The first motive--namely, that supplied by the mere "pleasure
in excelling"--we need hardly consider by itself, for, in so far as socialists can look upon
its objects as legitimate, it is included in the struggle for approbation or honour. We will
merely remark that the emphasis which the socialists lay on it is not very consonant with the
principles of those persons who propose to abolish competition as the root of all social evils;
and we will content ourselves with examining in detail the three other motives only, and the
scope of their efficiency, as actual experience reveals it to us.

We shall find that the activities which these three motives stimulate are confined, so far
as experience is able to teach us anything, to the following well-marked kinds, which have
been already indicated: those of the artist, of the speculative thinker, of the religious and
philanthropic enthusiast, and, lastly, those of the soldier. This list, if understood in its
full sense, is exhaustive.

Such being the case, then, the argument of the socialists is as follows: Because a Fra Angelico
will paint a Christ or a Virgin, because a Kant will immolate all his years to philosophy,
because a monk and a sister of mercy will devote themselves to the victims of pestilence, because
a soldier in action will eagerly face death--all without hope of any exceptional pecuniary
reward--the monopolists of business ability, if only such rewards are made impossible for them,
will at once become amenable to the motives of the soldier, the artist, the philosopher, the
inspired philanthropist, and the saint. This is the assertion of the socialists when reduced
to a precise form; and what we have to do is to inquire whether this assertion is true. Does
human nature, as history, as psychology, and as physiology reveal it to us, give us any grounds,
in fact, for taking such an assertion seriously? Any one who has studied human conduct historically,
who has observed it in the life around him, and examined scientifically the diversities of
temperament and motive that go with diversities of capacity, will dismiss such an assertion
as at once groundless and ludicrous.

Let us, to go into detail, take the case of the artist. What reason is there to suppose that
the impassioned emotion which stimulates the adoring monk to lavish all his genius on an altar-piece
will stimulate another man to devise, and to organise the production of, some new kind of liquid
enamel for the decoration of cheap furniture?[13] Or let us turn to an impulse closely allied
to the artistic--namely, the desire for speculative truth, as manifested in the lives of scientific
and philosophic thinkers. These men--such as Kant and Hegel, for example--have been proverbially,
and often ludicrously, indifferent to the material details of their existence. Who can suppose
that the disinterested passion for truth, which had the effect of making these men forget their
dinners, will stimulate others to devote themselves to the improvement of stoves and saucepans?

Yet again, let us consider the area of the industrial influence of the motives originating
in religious fervour or benevolence. The most important illustration of this is to be found
in the monastic orders. The monastic orders constructed great buildings; they successfully
practised agriculture and other industrial arts: and those of them who were faithful to their
vows aimed at no personal luxuries. On the contrary, their superfluous possessions were applied
by them to the relief of indigence. But this industrial asceticism was made possible only by
its association with another asceticism--the renunciation of women, the private home, the family.
Even so, in the days when Christian piety was at its highest, those who were capable of responding
to the industrial motives of the cloister formed but a fraction of the general population of
Christendom, while even among them these motives constantly ceased to operate; and, as St.
Francis declared with regard to his own disciples, the desire for personal gain continually
insisted on reasserting itself. What ground have we here for supposing that motives, whose
action hitherto has always been strictly limited to passionate and seclusive idealists turning
their backs on the world, will ever become general among the monopolists of that business ability,
the object of whom is to fill the world with increasing comforts and luxuries. One might as
well argue that, because the monastic orders were celibate, and formed at one time a very numerous
body, all men will probably soon turn celibate also, and yet at the same time continue to reproduce
their species.

But the scientific quality of the psychological reasoning of the socialists is best illustrated
by their treatment of another class of facts--that on which they themselves unanimously lay
the greatest stress--namely, the heroisms of the soldier, and other men of a kindred type.
The soldier, they say, is not only willing but eager to perform duties of the most painful
and dangerous kind, without any thought of receiving any higher pay than his fellows. If, then,
human nature is such, they continue, that we can get from it on these terms work such as that
of the soldier's, which is work in its most terrifying form, it stands to reason that we can,
on the same terms, get out of it work of a much easier kind, such as that of exceptional business
ability applied to the safe and peaceful direction of labour. Nor is this argument urged by
socialists only. Other thinkers who, though resembling them somewhat in sentiment, are wholly
opposed to socialism as a formal creed, have likewise pitched upon the soldier's conduct in
war as a signal illustration of the potentialities of human nature in peace. Thus Ruskin says
that his whole scheme of political economy is based on the moral assimilation of industrial
action to military. "Soldiers of the ploughshare," he exclaims in one of his works, "as well
as soldiers of the sword! All my political economy is comprehended in that phrase." So, too,
Mr. Frederic Harrison, the English prophet of Positivism, following out the same train of thought,
has declared that the soldier's readiness to die in battle for his country is a realised example
of a readiness, always latent in men, to spend themselves and be spent in the service of humanity
generally. Again in the same sense, another writer observes, "The soldier's subsistence is
certain. It does not depend on his exertions. At once he becomes susceptible to appeals to
his patriotism, and he will value a bit of bronze, which is the reward of valour, far more
than a hundred times its weight in gold"--a passage to which one of Mr. Sidney Webb's collaborators
refers with special delight, exclaiming, "Let those take notice of this last fact who fancy
we must wait till men are angels before socialism is practical."

But though she took him designate for Minervy's, which was private classes, yet as she feel he was

Framework and understand of doctor, a pale-unripe booklet that he

Five was up by creek, corporation-repudiation. She went into area, are merely on toes. Trunk was a

the things it said.

Phoebe called her, while had passed. Louise bathed her confront to water of Select, used her hankie,

Billy Louise would be set off unclearness. The terms that no mind. She gathered merely that it was
rather technical if it persisted-- whatever it was-- and that she leave her continued for period

and English that mommie was systematically over attack which requires argument was-- and that
she need thus popular days and medicine-- whatever that them was-- that for he had left. "It

she complained, when he drove away.

"I fight I see, but when I've got to travel blindfolded--" She brushed it digit to peeper and them
glanced hastily little appear-glass that hang beside position. "Yes, mommie, minute," she called
cheerfully. She ran into room, a can be of labour, and did not wait see whether she use it equally
to telltale, but dabbed at them repudiate idiom. "Abortionist says you're, mommie; only you

"No, I guess not!" Her mother. "I couldn't dig containerful,'m that weak. Did he state it was,
Louise?" The ill are ever curious illnesses! "Oh, lumbago. I forget to name when he gave it

"I guess he'd think it was something to worry about, it had it," her mother retorted fretfully,
but reassured however by mode.

"I believe I feed a tea," she added tentatively.

"And mr being educated soft if you desire it, more mom. Phoebe is just bring in socialists." Billy
Louise went out buzz unconcernedly under her breath as she had not a capital are found beyond proper toasting

in world is absolutely immutable of all, and would possibly-- Billy Louise did not maintain
changeless as her is therefore unkept faith. She see it is broken into fragments
before evidence, dust them would automatically for heaviness of what
she knew themselves of flagship he had told her himself.

So she thought thither was no faith of him, they travel empty and aching through the next the days.
But, Louise was turned, female-- not wholly because she was twenty!-- she halt, after awhile, gathered
carefully repudiate the belief, and, Deity, she begin to. First she forge of reservation. How
did she does ignore she had not made of mistake, the?

Regard and exceptional roan; other men were slim and she had only had a glance after all, light was
deceptive as there in shadows.

When that first doubt was model, she had respire of living are so that it stand before her, she took
less heart, them, her why she give the doubt.

She remembered what Charlie Canine had state about evidence. She do the mistake as he had made.
She spent continued days and long, wakeful officials. And since it look to apophatism is again
just as it had been, romance, she used all her innocence and all
her pity a romance and them created something even fresh than her
untried apophatism had been.

She had a it. She knew that she loved Cellblock; she had learned from engineering had given her realise
to exercise in him. That it was the Louise which no one always saw.

Louise which her is little world travel her property, except purposes in item that escaped of notice
of those close her command.

Look, thing; a DIFFICULTIES, look that was sometimes popular as well;
a mouth, also, that she was off her offer still to guard; a purposes,
droop that them state of responsibility and care she was transport.

Ward detect both confronted, socialism see her develop on lead. He had leave as chance that
she might be riding out that a manner, and he had go upon while and Blue were gaze over beginning of
they had attained in hills.

"'Lo, Instrument!" he said, and he was quite, and held himself ready of meet whatever temper
however she present.

She become her looked at him, and wage of countenance, american.

And Ward knew they had been thither before she saw him.

"Wha's, reckoning?" he inquire, that was calculated to disburden of her troubles. "Obstetrics, in directions.
S, i'concentration is always worried when I'concentration, she'll have another manual while I'concentration.
Doctor said she might have, time. Were it lead for production? If
you are, them test on; I was just starting back. I don't dare be
away any retentive."

If that were a nominal, ward was an man. Louise appear as him can personally, the oculus were legal
chapters and friendly rewards.

This detox was not be satisfied, it look smooth plenty. He was excessively sensitive sameness, he was
too to guess what was the concern. Blameworthiness is a atmosphere, Cellblock had none of it. The worst
of him admit she had cognize for the than a year; he had told them himself, and she had healed
the hurt-- almost-- past are appropriated by him and friendship. Could expect some Ward to guess
she had understand her apophatism in him would this die a death to no retentive than two hebdomad
ago? Such possibility is never it happen it to him. That, he felt there was the deviation.
It must still can be chilled eagerness, and it blanketed his gusto that he did not state the
rewards he had meant to. He had ridden over drupe. He had come to Louise and to tell her how and
where he had establish it. It is too private that he alter his cognition.

It would have explain thus distinguish much, if he had stand to direction. It would even brought to life
that first faith in him. She might have told him-- one never can anticipate the lengths of feeling
it transport her-- labour, assurance that she had understand him ride it continued. If she had, he would
have convinced her that she was mistaken, he had that afternoon been washing yellow is a knot from there,
it was too for him is to capital. He took the dorsum, he took it sooner than he had mean for ability.
He is also of minds of blues which seemed of have assail of effort,
he had not be quarreled with Louise, and had been warmly by "mommie."

Poor use was looking white, her temples were too purple. Ability told himself that it was no
Wilhemina move strained and unnatural problems. He intend as mr than always and them acquire
his stake that he go and make her give the mr of her.

He begin to figure, so that he would not have to "it hold it down" for period. Virtually she
desire to bring her parent. Humiliation, he would be forth go down and set that Wolverine shape.
He had no farm of own, she wanted it that manner.

He meant to be better "hooked of" financially than she was and more cattle, he put to control. So
he would do whatever she desire them induce to do, he would not have to torment his custom.
You see, and they could not have dispute, Ward transport palace as
well as blues.

In implement, parting had yield of Ward, Louise had travel with how him as usual intelligible as the
inducements, when he started manual.

And Ward had pluck up his checkrein and become to doctrine, Billy Louise had secured close-- shoulder.
Detox had become his face toward her, and Club Louise had impulsively
taken his caput, had appear of regard, and then had kissed him wage
it hillquit on lips.

Then that she had turned and fled up path, waving him away up the better slot. And Ward never

That it did not, but served merely of tangle, possibly proves how greatly the Louise had exacted
in weeks. She changed moreover in the next two date, however. There was the mho is precarious
health Louise is ever watchful employers and ever to goatskin her
fears.

She must be quick to detect the men of attack, she let her system them suspect that there was
danger. That much knowledge had made of plain to her. Too, there was the undertone of gossip
and rumors of cattle, ranch.

them until the period, after shut-pass most range-capital. Louise did not speak him can be very of much. He
had shifty peeper and a names, to loose-lipless implements, and, girl-like it, she took a dislike
to him. But Toilet told her subsequently that he was Dollar, checker, and that he was prowling
around which see if he find away anything.

Truncheon, that. She rode out middle exposure of going to exert Form's claim to discourage him. But
three men of which inspiration is change her goal: she presume not

Billy shrank from what might follow.

She questioned him are disingenuously-- work for the!-- and she determine the examiner was either

it, either. He had not be found to brands, he said. And he did not appear to know anything farther
approximately Ward than the existence. "There'element, Mill," he had note. "I'll must look him up when
I repudiate back, Seabeck says he's wholly correct DIFFICULTIES." "Detox is all right," asseverate
Billy, instead unwisely. "DIRECTIVE't a reservation of it. I thought possibly he might have
seen something that it give a clue." Possibly the policeman was wiser
than she yield him credit.

Then he mentioned the Power, and because she did not cognize more reason for admonish, he got the
message he wanted, more, for mommie was in one as humors. He travel
off in peeve, and I may be equally good to tell you why.

Do you understand that eventide male that he draw a Louise when she

Good, recognition was the man. And task went off from Person theoretically as intently as Cellblock
also of which him test. If Billy Louise had shed the land, it is really likely that he would have
pulled a weapon, also.'ve Louise might have done something more than
must throw the fragment at him if she had cognize who he was; but

was no taunt or tempt however him. Phoebe told him understand in brief, stolid developments
and gave him give of meal offered him gives a bed, he worsen. When the suspense became craze,
that, he wage to news. And news was monotonously scant. Phoebe could say and compose, manner, Club send
a encyclical and be then, state that mommie was of same, and that she wanted of things about farm.
She arrive mommie, she said. Ward is garner that she would not. Once when he was as spread,
he wrote as encyclical, and told her that he arrive to Boise if there
was anything he could do, and implore of being allow him cognize it

He worked and repudiate them worked, and try to crowd the tomorrow and implement, socialism-weariness.

One day, Ward was ride the hills off west, looking it of repudiation out for Y6 cattle. He

This is what "X" and similar thinkers forget; and the nature of their error is very pertinently
illustrated by an observation of the English jurist, Lord Coleridge, to which "X" solemnly
refers, as corroborating him in his own wisdom. "The same power," says Lord Coleridge, "which
prescribes rules for the possession of property can of course alter them"; this power being
the legislative body of whatever country may be in question. It is easy to see the manner in
which Lord Coleridge reasons. Because, in any country, the formulation and enforcement of laws
have the will of the governing body as the proximate cause which determines them, it seems
to Lord Coleridge that, in this contemporary will, the laws thus formulated and enforced have
their ultimate cause also. For example, according to him, the entire institution of property
in the State of New York is virtually a fresh creation of the voters from year to year, and
has nothing else behind it. But, in reality, all this business of formulation and enforcement
is a secondary process, not a primary process at all. Lord Coleridge is simply inverting the
actual order of things. Half the existing "rules prescribed as to the possession of property"
have, for their ultimate object, the protection of family life, the privacy of the private
home, and the provision made by parents for their children. But family life is not primarily
the creation of prescribed rules. It is the creation of instincts and affections which have
developed themselves in the course of ages. Instead of the law creating family life, it is
family life which has gradually called into being--which has created and dictated--the rules
and sanctions protecting it. The same is the case with bequest, marriage, and so forth. The
conduct of civilised men is bound to conform to laws, but the laws must first conform to general
human practice. They merely give precision to conduct which has a deeper origin than legislation.
Laws, in fact, may be compared to soldiers' uniforms. These, within certain limits, may be
varied indefinitely by a war-office; but they all must be such as will adapt themselves to
the human body and its movements. The will of a government may prescribe that the trousers
shall be tight or loose, that they shall be black or brown or bright green or vermilion. But
no government can prescribe that they shall be only three inches round the waist, or that the
soldier's sleeves shall start, not from the shoulders, but from the pockets of the coat-tails.
The human body is here a legislator which is supreme over all governments; and just the same
thing is true with regard to the human character.

Now, the curious thing with regard to "X" is that he is all along assuming this fundamental
fact himself; though he utterly fails to put two and two together, and see how this fact conflicts
with the omnipotence which he ascribes to legislation. Let us go back to the assertion, which
embodies his whole practical argument, that the majority of the voters in New York State could,
without interfering with the activity of any one of its citizens, limit incomes in any manner
they pleased, and alienate with even greater ease the property of every man at his death; and
let us see what he hastens to say as the sequel to this oracular utterance.

These powers of the sovereign majority, which he is apparently so anxious to invoke, would,
he says, be practically much less formidable in their action than timid persons might anticipate.
And why should they be less formidable? "Because," says "X," "although each man, by reason
of his manhood alone, has an equal voice with every other man in making the laws governing
their common country, and regulating the distribution of the common property ... yet immense
and incalculable differences exist in men's natural capacities for rendering honest service
to society. Encouragement should, therefore, be given to every man to use all the gifts which
he possesses to the fullest extent possible; and, accordingly, reasonable accumulations and
the descent of these should be respected." They should, he says, be respected. Yes--but for
what reason? Because they encourage exceptional men, whose services are essential to society,
to develop and use their capacities to "the fullest extent possible"; and this is merely another
way of saying that, without the motive provided by the possibility of accumulation and bequest,
the exceptional faculties would not be developed or used at all. Moreover, the amounts which
may be accumulated and bequeathed, although they will be strictly limited, must, "X" says,
be considerable. He suggests that incomes should be allowed up to £8,000, and bequeathable
property up to £200,000. And here we come to a question which is still more pertinent than
the preceding. Why must the permissible amounts of income and of bequeathable property be of
proportions such as those which he contemplates? Why does he not take his bill and write down
quickly £200 of income instead of £8,000, and limit bequeathable property to £2,000 instead
of £200,000? Because he evidently recognises that the men whose possible services to society
are "immensely and incalculably greater" than those of the majority of their fellow citizens
would not be tempted by a reward which, reduced to its smallest proportions, would not be very
largely in excess of what was attainable by more ordinary exertions. In his formal statement
of his case, he says that the amount of the reward would be entirely determined by what ought
to be sufficient for the purpose in the estimation of the voting majority; and he mentions
the sums in question as those on which they would probably fix. And it is, of course, quite
imaginable that the majority, in making either these or any other estimates, might be right.
But what "X" fails altogether to see is that, if the majority of the citizens were right, such
sums would not be sufficient because the majority of citizens happened to think that they ought
to be. They would be sufficient because they were felt to be sufficient by the minority who
were invited to earn them, at whose feelings the majority would have made a shrewd or a lucky
guess. A thousand men with fishing-rods might meet in an inn parlour and vote that such and
such flies were sufficient to attract trout. But it lies with the trout to determine whether
or no he will rise to them. It is a question, not of what the fishermen think, but of what
the trout thinks; and the fishermen's thoughts are effective only when they coincide with the
trout's.

So long, then, as society desires to get the best work out of its citizens, and so long as
some men are, in the words of "X," "immensely and incalculably" more efficient than the great
mass of their fellows, and so long as their efficiency requires, as "X" admits that it does,
some exceptional reward to induce these men to develop it, these men themselves, in virtue
of their inherent characters, must primarily determine what the reward shall be; and not all
the majorities in the world, however unanimous, could make a reward sufficient if the particular
minority in question did not feel it to be so. The majority might, by making a sufficient reward
unattainable, easily prevent the services from being rendered at all; but, unless they are
to forgo the services, the majority can only obtain them on terms which will, in the last resort,
depend on the men who are to render them.

Now, in what I have been urging thus far--which practically comes to this, that the sovereignty
popularly ascribed to democratic majorities is an illusion--not socialists only, but other
advocates of popular government also, will alike be against me, as the promulgator of some
blasphemous paradox. It will be easy, however, to show them that their objections are quite
mistaken, and that the exceptional powers of dictation which have just been ascribed to a minority
are so far from being inconsistent with the real powers of the majority that the latter, when
properly understood, are seen to be their complement and their counterpart. For, though socialists
and thinkers like "X" ascribe to majorities powers which they do not possess, we shall find
that majorities do actually possess others, in some ways very much greater, of which such thinkers
have thus far taken no cognisance at all. I have said that minorities can dictate their own
terms to majorities which desire to secure their services, the reason being that the former
are alone competent to determine what treatment will supply them with a motive to exert themselves.
What holds good of minorities as opposed to majorities holds good in essentials, though in
a somewhat different form, of majorities as opposed to such minorities.

Let us turn again to a matter to which I have referred already--namely, the family life of
the citizens of any race or nation. This results from propensities in a vast number of human
beings which, although they are similar, are in each case independent. These propensities give
rise to legislation, the object of which is to prescribe rules by which their satisfaction
may be made secure; but the propensities are so far from originating in legislation that no
legislation which seriously interfered with them would be tolerated. Socialists themselves
have continually admitted this very thing. The Italian socialist, Giovanni Rossi, for instance,
who attempted about fifteen years ago to found a socialistic colony in Brazil--an attempt which
completely failed--attributed its failure largely to this particular cause--namely, the impossibility
of inducing the colonists to conform to any rules of the community by which family life was
interfered with. Here we have an example of democracy in its genuine form, rendering powerless
what affected to be democratic legislation. We have the cumulative power of similar human characters
compelling legislation to limit itself to what these characters spontaneously demand. And now
let us go a step--a very short step--further. The family propensities in question show their
dictatorial power, not only in the limitations which they impose on positive laws, but also
in the character which they impose on the material surroundings of existence, especially in
the material structure of the dwellings of all classes except the lowest. All are constructed
with a view to keeping the family group united, and each family group separate from all others.
Further, if the natural family propensities thus affect the structure of the dwelling, other
propensities, more various in detail, but in each case equally spontaneous, determine what
commodities shall be put into it.

And this fact brings us back to our own more immediate subject--namely, the power of the few
and of the many in the sphere of economic production. The man of exceptional industrial capacity
becomes rich in the modern world by producing goods, or by rendering services, which others
consume or profit by, and for which they render him a return. But, in order that they may take,
and render him this return for what he offers them, the goods and the services must be such
that the many desire to have them. All the highest productive ability that has ever been devoted
to the business of cheapening and multiplying commodities, or rendering social services, would
be absolutely futile unless these commodities and services satisfied tastes or wants existing
in various sections of the community. The eliciting of such wants or tastes depends very often,
and in progressive communities usually, on a previous supply of the commodities or services
that minister to them--as we see, for example, in the case of tobacco, of the telegraph, and
of the bicycle; but, when once the demands have been elicited, they are essentially democratic
in their nature. Each customer is like a voter who practically gives his vote for the kind
of goods which he desires to have supplied to him. He gives his vote under no compulsion. He
is under the manipulation of no party or wire-puller; and the men by whose ability the goods
are cheapened and multiplied are bound to determine their character by the number of votes
cast for them.[15]

Thus, while--so long as the productivity of labour is intensified, as it is in the modern world,
by the ability of the few who direct labour--the labouring majority can never be free in their
technical capacity of producers, they are free, and must always remain free, in respect of
their tastes as consumers. In other words, demand is essentially democratic, while supply,
in proportion to its sustained and enhanced abundance, is essentially oligarchic.

Now, that demand is essentially democratic, and depends on the tastes and characters of those
by whom the demands are made, nobody will be inclined to deny. But if we turn our attention
from society, taken as a whole, to the exceptionally able minority on whom the business of
supply depends, we shall find that these men, in their turn, form similarly a small democracy
in themselves, and make, as suppliers, their own demands also--a demand for an economic reward,
or an amount of personal wealth, not, indeed, necessarily equal to the amount of wealth produced
by them, but bearing a proportion to it which is, in their own estimation, sufficient. This
demand made by the exceptional producer rests on exactly the same basis as does that of the
average customer. It rests on the tastes and characters of the men who make it; and it is just
as impossible for the many to decide by legislation that the few shall put forth the whole
of their exceptional powers for the sake of one reward, when what they want is another, as
it is for the few to make the many buy snuff when they want tobacco, or buy green coats when
they want black.[16]

That such is the case will, to those who may be inclined to doubt it, become more evident if
they consider with more attention than they are generally accustomed to exercise what the main
attraction of great wealth is for the men who in the modern world are the producers of it on
the greatest scale. Socialists and similar reformers--the people who principally busy themselves
with discussing what this attraction is--are the people who are least capable of forming any
true opinion about it. They not only have, as a rule, no experience of wealth themselves, but
they are further generically distinguished by a deficiency of those powers that create it.
They are like men with no muscles, who reason about the temperament of a prize-fighter; and
their conception of what wealth means for those who produce and possess it is apt, in consequence,
to be of the most puerile kind. It is founded, apparently, on their conception of what a greedy
boy, without pocket-money, feels when he stares at the tarts lying in a pastry-cook's window.
To them it seems that the desire for great wealth means simply the desire for purely sensual
self-indulgence--especially for the eating and drinking of expensive food and wine. Consequently,
whenever they wish to caricature a capitalist they invariably represent him as a man with a
huge, protuberant stomach. The folly of this conception is sufficiently shown by the fact that
many of the greatest of fortune-makers have, in their personal habits, been abstemious and
even niggardly to a degree which has made them proverbial; and that, even in the case of those
who value personal luxury, the maximum of self-indulgence which any single human organism can
appreciate, is obtainable by a hundredth part of the fortunes for the production of which such
men work. The real secret of the attraction which wealth has for those who create it lies in
the fact that wealth is simply a form of power. These men are made conscious by experience,
as less gifted men are not, that they can, by the exercise of their own mental energies, add
indefinitely to the wealth-producing forces of the community. They feel the machine respond
to their own exceptional management of it; they see the output of wealth varied and multiplied
at their will; and thus the results of their specialised power as producers are neither more
nor less than this same internal power converted into an external, an indeterminate and universalised
form; and the reason why they will never produce wealth merely in order to be deprived of it
is that no one will exercise power merely in order to lose it, and allow it to pass into the
hands of other people. These men, as experience, especially in America, shows us, are constantly
willing to use this power for the benefit of their kind generally; but this is no more a sign
that they would be willing to allow it to be forcibly taken from them than the fact that a
man is willing to give a shilling to a beggar in the street is a sign that he would allow the
beggar to steal it out of his waistcoat-pocket.

So long as differences in personal power exist, especially in such power as affects the material
circumstances of mankind, these differences in power, let governments take what form they please,
will necessarily assert and embody themselves in the very structure of human society; and socialists
are only able to obscure this fact from anybody either by a childish theory of modern production
which they themselves are now repudiating, or else by a psychology even more laboriously childish,
which would at once be exposed were it tested by so much as six months' experience. An interesting
admission of the truth of this may be found in an unlikely place--namely, a work written some
years ago by a socialist of considerable talent, which shows how the errors of at least a number
of socialists are due, not to any defect in their reasoning powers, as such, but to a want
of balanced knowledge of human nature in general, a want which in certain respects renders
their reasoning futile. The work to which I refer is a work by a socialistic novelist, who
was also an accomplished naturalist--the late Mr. Grant Allen. It is called The Woman Who Did.

The immediate object of the writer was to exhibit the institution of marriage as the cause
of what he was pleased to regard as woman's degradation and slavery; and his heroine is a young
lady of highly respectable parentage, who proposes to regenerate womanhood by living with,
and having children by, a man, without submitting to the humiliation of any legal bond. She
accomplishes her purpose, and has a daughter, whose position, under our false civilisation,
becomes so disagreeable in consequence of her illegitimate birth, that the mother at last commits
suicide, in order to deliver her from the presence of such an embarrassing parent. In the author's
view she is a martyr, and a model for immediate imitation. Ludicrous, however, as the book
is in its main scheme and in its object, the author shows great acuteness in a number of his
incidental observations. He is, for example, constantly insisting on the fact that the institution
of private property, which socialism aims at revolutionising, is merely one embodiment of a
general principle of individualism of which marriage and the family are another, and that the
two stand and fall together. But an admission yet more important than this is as follows: So
that nothing may be wanting to the bitterness of the heroine's sublime martyrdom, the author
represents her daughter--and he does this with considerable skill--as developing from her earliest
childhood all those tastes and prejudices (an instinctive sympathy with those ordinary motives
and standards) against which the mother's whole life, and her education of her daughter, had
been at war. Let us read this passage, with the alteration of only a word or two, and it forms
an admirable criticism of the more recent speculations of the party to which Mr. Allen belonged.
There is no more silly and persistent error on the part of socialists than the belief that
they can influence to any appreciable degree the moral ideas and impulses of the citizens of
any community, or that these things, which are the flower of congenital individuality, can
be altered after birth by the foolishness of socialism.

But the arguments at the service of socialism are not exhausted yet. Even if voting majorities
should be unable to transform human nature, that men of power shall become willing to exert
their power only in order that they may be deprived of it, there is a class of socialists who
declare that what is impossible with mere human democracy, will be rendered possible by the
divine influence of a rightly preached Christianity. To Christian socialists, as such, I have
as yet made no special reference; nor will it be necessary now to be very prolix in our dealings
with them; but in their attitude and their equipment for the task of effecting an economic
revolution, they throw so strong a light on the character of contemporary socialism generally
that a brief consideration of their gospel will be interesting and highly instructive, and
will fitly lead us to the conclusion of this part of our argument.

FOOTNOTES:

[15] Mr. G. Wilshire, in his criticism of the argument, as stated by me in America, says that,
under the existing system, the consumer is not free to choose what goods he will buy, but has
them thrust on him by the capitalist producer. Yet he, and socialists in general, complain
at the same time of the competition between capitalists, which is simply a competition to supply
what consumers most desire. Here and there, when no competition exists, one firm can force
its goods, if they are of the nature of necessaries, on the local public. But under the existing
system this is only an occasional incident. Under socialism it would be universal. When tobacco
is a state monopoly, state tobacco is forced on the great mass of the people.

[16] Mr. G. Wilshire admits, on behalf of socialists, that the argument of this chapter is
so far correct that no democracy can make men of ability exercise their ability if they do
not wish to do so; and that if they wish for exceptional rewards they will be able to demand
them. A Melba, he says, under socialism, would be able, if she wished for it, to get probably
even higher remuneration than she does to-day. But, he continues, under socialism, such men
and women, though they could get such rewards, will be so changed that they will not wish for
them. A Melba will then sing for the mere pleasure of singing.

CHAPTER XI

CHRISTIAN SOCIALISM AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SECULAR DEMOCRACY.

Christian socialism, as a doctrine which is preached to-day, might, for anything that its name
can tell us to the contrary, be as different from ordinary socialism as is Christian Science
from secular--as the science of Mrs. Eddy is from the science of Mr. Edison. We can judge of
it only by examining the utterances of its leading exponents. For this reason, although I had
long been familiar with the utterances of persons who call themselves Christian socialists
in England, I felt bound to decline an invitation to discuss the subject in America, unless
I could be furnished with some recent and formal version of the gospel as it is preached there.
Accordingly there was sent to me the precise kind of document I desired. It formed the principal
article in a journal called The Christian Socialist. Its author was a clergyman,[17] and it
was entitled "The Gospel for To-day." It was what I expected that it would be. It reproduced
in almost every particular the thoughts and moods distinctive of Christian socialists in England;
and this article I will here take as a text.

The writer, exhibiting a candour which many of his secular brethren would do well to imitate,
starts with an attack on all existing forms of democracy, which are all, he says, based on
a profound and fatal fallacy. This is the assumption that all men are born equal, from which
assumption the practical conclusion is deduced that the best state of society is one which
will allow each of these so-called equal beings to work out his own happiness as best he can
for himself, with the minimum of interference from his fellow-citizens or from the law. Now
if, says our author, men were born equal in reality, such an individualistic democracy might
perhaps work well enough. But men are not born equal. The root of the difficulty lies here.
In the economic sense, as in all others, some men are incomparably more able than the great
majority of their fellows, and even among the exceptionally able some are much abler than the
others. Consequently, if the principles of modern individualistic democracy and modern individualistic
economics are right, according to which the main motive of each should be to do the best for
himself with his own powers that he can--"if it is duty to compete if competition is the life
of trade, then the battle for self must ever go grimly on. The strong must subdue the weak,
the rich the poor, the able the unable. Upon this basis the millionaire and the multi-millionaire
have a perfect right to roll up their untold millions, even as the working-man has a right
to seek the highest wages that he can get. All in different ways are seeking their own; and
the keenest competitors are the best men. The prizes must go to the strongest and the shrewdest.
It is the survival of the fittest."

Such being the case, then, asks the writer, what does Christian socialism aim at? It does not
aim at making men equal in respect of their ability, for to do this would be quite impossible;
but it aims at producing an equality of a practical kind, by inducing the men whose ability
is most efficient to forgo all personal claims which are founded on their own exceptional powers,
so that the wealth which is at present secured by these powers for themselves may in the future
be divided among the mass of their less able brethren.

Thus the crucial change which the Christian socialists would accomplish is identical with that
contemplated by their secular allies or rivals. But the more completely it is invested with
a definitely religious quality, the more lopsided, unstable, and self-stultifying is this change
seen to be; the more obvious becomes the absurdity of proposing to reorganise the entire business
of the world on the basis of a conversion de luxe which is to be the privilege of the few only,
while the many are not only debarred, from the very nature of the case, from practising the
renunciation in which the few are to find eternal life, but are actually urged to cherish their
existing economic concupiscence, and raise it to a pitch of intensity which it never has reached
before. The competent, to whose energies the riches of the world are due, are to put these
riches away from them as though they were food offered by the devil. The incompetent, with
thankless but perpetually open mouths, are to swallow this same food as though it were the
bread from heaven. In other words, according to our Christian socialist, the sin against the
Holy Ghost, which is involved in the enjoyment of riches, is not the enjoyment of material
superfluities itself, but only the enjoyment of them by men who have been at the trouble of
producing them.

That this is what the message of Christian socialism comes to, little as those who deliver
it realise the fact themselves, is shown by an illustration obtruded on us by the author of
"The Gospel for To-day." The evils of the existing situation, and its remoteness from the Kingdom
of Christ, are, he says, exemplified in a very special way by the present position of the clergy.
"If we churchmen," he says, "want money for our own purposes, we have to go to the trust magnates
and kneel. We have to kneel to 'the steel kings and the oil kings,' merely because they are
rich men." Now, how would Christian socialism alter a state of things like this? Let us consider
precisely what it is that our Christian socialist complains about. He obviously does not mean
that he and his brother clergymen have to approach the trust magnates on their knees. The utmost
he can mean is that, if they want these men to give them money, they have to ask for it as
a gift, and presumably make, when it is given, some acknowledgment to the donors. This it is
which evidently sticks in the stomach of the humble follower of Christ whose self-portraiture
we are now considering; for, if we confine ourselves to the Christian element in his teaching,
he proposes to alter the existing situation only by kindling in the "trust magnates" such a
fire of Christian philanthropy that they will have given him all he wants before he has had
time to ask for it, thus exonerating him from the duty of saying "Thank you" for what he owes
to another's goodness, and enabling him to offer to the Lord that which has cost him nothing.

And what the author of "The Gospel for To-day" urges on behalf of himself and his clerical
brethren is precisely what he urges on behalf of the less competent majority generally. Neither
on them nor on the Christian clergy does the gospel of Christian socialism urge the duty of
making any new sacrifice, or any new exertion, moral or physical, for themselves. Just as the
clergy are to learn no more of business than they know now, but are to be relieved of the necessity
for all prudence as to ways and means, so is the ordinary labourer to work no longer, no harder,
and no better than he does now. On the contrary, his hours of labour are to become ever less
and less, and at the same time he is to receive ever greater and greater wages. These are to
be drawn from the products, not of himself but of his neighbour: and although he will owe them
solely to the virtue which his neighbour exercises, he is, according to the Christian socialist
programme, to demand them as though his own incompetence gave him a sacred right to them.

Now, apart from the fact that this gospel does resemble the Christian in declaring that, while
salvation can be achieved only by sacrifice, and that so far as the majority are concerned
their sacrifice must be strictly vicarious, we might well pause to inquire how either of its
two messages--that of economic asceticism for the few, and of economic concupiscence for the
many--has any relation to the gospel of Christ at all. According to any reasonable interpretation
of the words and spirit of Christ, a labourer's desire to enjoy the utmost that he himself
produces is no less legitimate than natural; but it hardly ranks as one of the highest Christian
virtues. How, we might ask, is it to acquire this latter character by being turned into a desire
for what is produced by other people? Again, on the other hand, though according to most of
the churches Christ did not condemn the possession of superfluous wealth as such, he certainly
did not teach that the possession of it was generally necessary to salvation. It might therefore
be justly urged, from the point of view of the few, that in proportion as Christ's valuation
of this transitory life was accepted by them, the duty of melting down their own vases and
candelabra in order that every workman's spoon might have a thin plating of silver on it, would
constantly seem less and less, instead of more and more imperative. All this might be urged,
and more to the same effect; but we will content ourselves with considering the matter under
its purely practical aspect, and asking how any Christian clergymen--men presumably sane and
educated--can propose, whether their programme be really Christian or no, to reorganise society
on the basis of a moral conversion which is confined to the few only--which would exact from
the able minority the maximum of effort and mortification, and secure the maximum of idleness
and self-indulgence for the rest of the human race?

To this question it may be said that there are two answers. Admirable in character as are multitudes
of the Christian clergy, nobody will contend that all of them are beyond reproach; nor will
any such claim be made for all those of them who profess socialism. And for some of this body
it is hardly open to doubt that the preaching of socialism is nothing better than a species
of ecclesiastical electioneering. In the language of the political wire-puller, it affords
them a good "cry" with which to go to the people. Why, they say in effect, should you listen
to the agitator in the street, when we can give you something just as good from the pulpit?
What the message really means which they thus undertake to deliver, they make no effort to
understand. It will attract, or at least they think so; and for the moment this is enough for
them. Having probably emptied their churches by talking traditional nonsense, they are willing
to fill them by talking nonsense that has not even the merit of being traditional. We will
not linger, however, over the case of men like these. We will turn to that of others who are
morally very much more respectable, and whose condition of mind, moreover, is very much more
instructive. Of these we may take the author of "The Gospel for To-day" as a type. He, we may
assume, advocates his socialistic programme, not because he thinks that to do so is a shrewd
clerical manoeuvre, but because he honestly believes that his programme is at once Christian
and practicable. How does it come about, then, that an educated man like himself can believe
in, and devote himself to preaching, doctrines so visionary and preposterous? Let us examine
his arguments more minutely, and we shall presently find our answer.

By his vigorous denunciation of the doctrine that all men are born equal, he shows us that
he is capable to a certain extent of seeing things as they are. But he sees them from a distance
only, as though they were a range of distant mountains whose aspect is falsely simplified and
constantly changed by clouds, and of whose actual configuration he has no idea whatever. Thus
when he contemplates the inequalities of men's economic powers, these appear to him alternately
in two different forms--as genuine powers of production and as powers of mere seizure--without
his discerning where in actual life the operation of the one ends and the operation of the
other begins: and, though for a certain special purpose he admits, as we shall see presently,
that some able men are able in the sense of being exceptionally productive, his thoughts and
his feelings alike through the larger part of his argument are dominated by the idea that ability
is merely acquisitive. This is shown by the fact that the two great productive enterprises
which he singles out as typical of modern wealth-getting generally are held up by him as examples
of acquisition pure and simple. "The steel kings," he says, "did not invent steel. The oil
kings did not invent oil." These are the gifts of nature, which nature offers to all; but the
strong men abuse their strength by pushing forward and seizing them, and compelling their weaker
brethren to pay them a tribute for their use. Steel and refined oil he evidently looks upon
as two natural products. He has no suspicion that, as any school-boy could have told him, steel
is an artificial metal which, as manufactured to-day, is one of the most elaborate triumphs
of modern industrial genius. As to the oil by the light of which he doubtless writes his sermons,
he apparently thinks of it as existing fit for use in a lake, and ready to be dipped up by
everybody in nice little tin cans, if only the oil kings having got to the lake first, did
not by their superior strength frighten other people away. Of the actual history of the production
of usable oil, of the vast and marvellous system by which it is brought within reach of the
consumers, of the by-products which reduce its price--all of them the results of concentrated
economic ability, and requiring from week to week its constant and renewed application--the
author of "The Gospel for To-day" apparently knows nothing. The oil kings and the steel kings,
according to his conception of them, need merely refrain from the exercise of their only distinctive
power--that is to say, an exceptional power of seizing; and every Christian socialist in New
York and elsewhere will have the same oil in his lamps that he has now, and a constant supply
of cutlery and all other forms of hardware, the sole difference being that he will get them
at half-price or for nothing, and have the money thus saved to spend upon new enjoyments. And
his conception of ability, as connected with the output of steel and oil, is his conception
of ability as applied to the production of goods generally.

He makes, however, one exception. There is, he admits, one form of ability which does actually
add to the wealth of the modern world, and may possibly be credited with producing the largest
part of it. This is the faculty of invention. Here, at last, we seem to be listening to the
language of sober sense. But let us see what follows. Inventors, our author proceeds, being
the types of exceptional ability which is really beneficent and productive, are precisely the
men who afford us our surest grounds for believing in the possibility of that moral conversion
which socialism proposes to effect among able men at large. For what, he says, as a fact do
we find the inventors doing? They invent, he says, for the pure love of inventing, or else
from a desire to do good to their fellow creatures. The thought of money for themselves never
enters into their minds. The selfish desire for money makes its appearance only when the strong
man whose ability is merely acquisitive thrusts himself on the scene, buys the inventors' inventions
up, and then proceeds "to work them for all they are worth." These mere seizers of wealth,
these appropriators of the inventions of others, need but to learn a lesson of abnegation which
the inventors have learned already, or rather a lesson which is easier; for while these noble
men, the inventors, have no wish to take what they produce, the majority of able men, such
as the steel kings and the oil kings, need merely forbear to take. Competition, in short, as
it actually exists to-day--the competition which Christian socialism will abolish--is simply
a competition in taking; and in order to abolish it, the strong men, when they have taken a
fair share, have but to stand aside, to become as though they were weak, and so give others
a chance equal to their own.

Here, indeed, we have a conception, or rather a vague picture, of the facts of modern industry,
and of human nature as connected with it, which is worthy of a man from dreamland. Every detail
mentioned is false. Every essential detail is omitted. In the first place, the disinterested
inventor, from whose behaviour our author reasons, is purely a figment of his own clerical
brain. Inventors in actual life, as every one knows who has had occasion to deal with them,
are generally distinguished by an insane desire for money, by the wildest over-estimates of
the wealth which their inventions will ultimately bring them, or by a greed which will sell
them for a trifle, provided this be paid immediately. In the second place, inventions, even
the greatest, so long as they represent the power of invention merely, are utterly deficient
in all practical value. So long as they exist nowhere except in the author's brain, or drawings,
or in descriptions, or even in the form of models, they might, so far as the world is concerned,
have never existed at all. In the former cases they are dreams; in the last case they are toys.
They are brought down into the arena of actual life only when, like souls provided with bodies,
they cease to be ideas or toys, and become machines or contrivances manufactured on a commercial
basis; and in order to effect successfully this practical transformation, countless processes
and countless faculties are involved other than those comprised in intellectual invention itself.

There are cases, no doubt, in which the practical talents necessary for realising an invention
and the faculty of invention itself coexist in the same man; but the inventor, when this happens,
is not an inventor only. He is not only a master of ideas; he is a master of things and men.
Such a combination is, however, far from common. As a rule, if his inventions are to be of
any use to the world, the inventor must ally himself with men of another type, and these are
the very men whom the author of "The Gospel for To-day" conceives of as simply monopolising
and "working for all they are worth" contrivances which would otherwise have been given to
the world gratis. He does not see that, if men such as the steel kings and the oil kings did
not work inventions for all they are worth, the inventions themselves would be practically
worth nothing.

Let the reader reflect on the astounding ignorance of the world, and especially of the world
of industry, which is betrayed with so much naïveté by this socialist of the Christian pulpit.
He knows so little of the commonest facts of history that he looks upon steel as a ready-made
product of nature, and all the mills of the steel trust as merely a means of monopolising knives,
bridges, rails, and locomotive-engines, which the citizens of America would otherwise be able
to take at will, like a bevy of school-children helping themselves from a heap of apples. He
imagines that inventions, as they form themselves in the head of the inventor, leap direct
into use, without any intervening process; while the inventor himself is a being so superior
to the world he works in, that the rapture of being allowed to work for it is the only reward
he covets, that he has never dreamed of such selfish things as profits, and does not even know
the meaning of a patent or a founder's share; and that the oil kings and the steel kings and
all other able men, will save society by following in the footsteps of this chimera.

Such are the wild, childish, and disconnected ideas entertained by our clerical author of the
world which he proposes to reform; and he is in this respect not peculiar. On the contrary
he is a most favourable type of Christian socialists generally; and Christian socialists, in
respect of their mental and moral equipment, are simply secular socialists of the more modern
and educated type, with their ignorances and credulities accentuated, but not otherwise altered,
by the solemnities of religious language, and a vague religious sentiment which achieves a
facile intensity because it is never restrained by fact.

Socialists, in short, of all schools, are socialists because they are ignorant of, or fail
to apprehend, certain facts or principles of nature and of human nature which are essential
to the complicated process of modern productive industry; or it is perhaps a truer way of putting
the case to say that they could not be socialists unless they were thus ignorant. In this they
resemble the devisers of perpetual motions, or scientific and infallible systems for breaking
the bank at a roulette-table. In so far as they are socialists--that is to say, in so far as
they differ from other reformers--they are men aiming at something which is in its nature impracticable;
and in order to represent it to themselves and others as practicable, they must necessarily
ignore or fail to understand something which, in actual life, stands in the way of its being
so. The perpetual-motionist believes that a perpetual motion is practicable, because he fails
to see that out of no machine whatever is it possible to get more force than is put into it,
and that one pound-weight will not wind up another. The system-monger sees that if a succession
of similar stakes are placed on red or black, or any one of the thirty-six numbers, the bank
always has zero in its favour; but by placing a number of stakes simultaneously in intricate
combinations, or by graduating them according to results, he imagines that he can invert the
situation, when all he can do is to disguise it. He often disguises it most effectually; but
in the long run he does no more. Like a protuberance in an air cushion, which if pushed down
in one place reappears in another, the original advantage of the bank infallibly ends in reasserting
itself. The system-monger fails to see this for one reason only--that, having disguised, he
thinks that he has eliminated, a fundamental fact of the situation. Socialists, in so far as
they are socialists, reason in the same way. Though most of them now recognise, like the author
of "The Gospel for To-day," that the economic efficiencies of men are in the highest degree
unequal, they propose out of an inequality of functions to produce an equality of conditions.
The details of the changes by which they propose to effect this result, or the grounds on which
they seek to represent this result as possible, vary like the details of the systems of ingenious
gamblers. But whatever these details may be, whether they are details of scheme or argument,
the essential element of each is the omission of some fundamental fact--or, rather, of one
protean fact--by which socialistic thinkers are often honestly confused, because it assumes,
as they shift their positions, any number of different aspects. This is the fact that out of
unequal men it is absolutely impossible to construct a society of equals.

Two illustrations, taken from the history of socialistic thought, will show how socialists
hide this fact from themselves, first by a fallacy of one kind, then by a fallacy of another
kind; and how, wherever it is located, it is the essential factor in their argument.

In their endeavour to prove the possibility of an equalisation, absolute or approximate, of
economic conditions, Karl Marx and the earlier socialists started with two main doctrines.
The one was a moral doctrine; the other was an economic. The moral doctrine was that, as a
matter of eternal justice, every man has a right to the whole of what is produced by him. The
economic doctrine was that, as a matter of fact, the only producers of wealth are the mass
of manual labourers, and that, with certain unimportant exceptions, the economic values produced
by all labourers are equal. Hence he argued that all wealth ought to go to the labourers, and
that all labourers were entitled to approximately equal shares of it. The later socialists
aim at reaching the same conclusion, and they start with two doctrines, a moral and an economic,
likewise. Having arrived, however, at a truer theory of production--having recognised that
labour is not the sole producer, and that some men produce incalculably more than others--they
have, in order to support their demand for an equality of possession, been obliged to supplement
their repudiation of the economic theory of their predecessors, by repudiating their theory
of eternal justice also, and introducing another of a wholly opposite character. While Karl
Marx contended that, in justice, production and possession were inseparable, the later socialists
contend that there is no connection between them, and that it is perfectly easy to convert
to this moral view every human being who is likely to suffer by its adoption. Thus the difference
between the earlier and the later socialists is as follows: The earlier socialists started
with a theory of justice which is in harmony with common-sense and the general instincts of
mankind; and this theory was pressed into the service of socialism only by being associated
with a false theory of production. The later socialists start with a truer theory of production;
and they reconcile this with their own practical programme, only by associating it with a false
moral psychology. In each case a fallacy is the basis of the socialistic conclusion; and without
a fallacy somewhere--a fallacy which is pushed about, like a mouse under a table-cloth--no
socialistic conclusion even tends to develop itself from the premises.

And what is true of the main arguments of the later, as of the earlier socialists, is equally
true of their subsidiary arguments also, from those which refer to the generalisations of the
sociologists of the nineteenth century, and base themselves on the confusion between speculative
truth and practical, down to those which are drawn from the absurd psychological supposition
that all motives are interchangeable, and that those which actuate the artist, the anchorite,
and the soldier can be made to replace by means of a vote or a sermon those which at present
actuate the masters of industrial enterprise. On whatever argumentative point the socialists,
as socialists, lay stress, there, under one form or another, their root-fallacy reappears. Did

 But if for one year this director were to retire
and another was to take his place, and, the same labourers being directed by this new master,
the result was the production not of one ship but of two; and if, when the year was ended,
and the old master came back again, the annual product once more was not the two ships but
one, we could then say, as a matter of common-sense with regard to the year during which the
two vessels were built, that the second vessel, whatever might be the case with the first,
was due wholly to the ability of the master, and not to the labour of the men. In other words,
the ability of the director of labour produces so much of the product, or of that product's
value as exceeds what was produced by the labourers before their labour was directed by him,
and would cease to be produced any longer as soon as his direction was withdrawn.

That in the case of any result which requires separable causes for its production, this method
of allocating to these causes respectively so much of the result and so much of it only, is
a method always adopted in all practical reasoning, may be seen by taking a result which is
not beneficial but criminal. Twenty Russian labourers, all loyal to the Czar, are, let us say,
employed to dig out a cellar under a certain street, and to fill it with cases which ostensibly
contain wine. Subsequently, as the Czar is passing, he is killed by a huge explosion. It then
becomes apparent that the so-called cellar was a mine, and the harmless-looking cases had really
been filled with dynamite. Now, if all those concerned in the consummation of this catastrophe
were tried, it is perfectly evident that the part played by the labourers would be sharply
discriminated from that played by the man employing them; and, although they contributed something
which was necessary to the production of the result, it would certainly have been admitted
by General Trepoff himself that they had contributed nothing to its essential and criminal
elements. It is equally evident that the increment of wealth which results from the obedience
of labourers to injunctions which do not emanate from themselves, is produced by the man who
gives the injunctions, and not by the men who obey them.

But here we must return to the argument, already mentioned in passing, which may be restated
thus: A thousand labourers, directed by their own intelligence only, produce a product whose
amount we will call a thousand. The same labourers are directed by a man of ability, and the
product rises from one thousand to two. But if the production of this second thousand is to
be credited to the man of ability on the ground that, were the ability absent, no second thousand
would be produced, we may reach by the same reasoning a conclusion precisely opposite, and
credit not only the first, but both the thousands to labour, on the ground that, if the labour
were absent, nothing would be produced at all. The argument is plausible; and in order to understand
its fallacy we must give our attention to a fact, not generally realised, which is involved
in all practical reasoning about all causes whatsoever.

If we use the word "cause" in its strict speculative sense, the number of causes involved in
the simplest effect is infinite. Let us take, for example, the speed of a horse which wins
a race. Why does the speed of this horse exceed that of the others? We may in answer point
to qualities of its individual organism. But these will carry us back to all its recorded ancestors--sires
and dams for a large number of generations: and even so we shall have been taken but a small
part of our way. The remotest of these ancestors--why were they horses at all? For our answer
we must travel through the stages of organic evolution, till we reach the point at which animal
and vegetable life were one. Had any of these antecedents been missing, the winning race-horse
would not have won the race. Nor is this all. We have to include in our causes air, gravitation,
and the fact that the earth is solid. No horse could win on turf which was based on vapour.
But by all the thousands who witness a great race this whole mass of ulterior, though necessary,
causes is ignored. The only causes which for them have any practical interest are those comprised
in the organism of the winning horse itself. Who would contend that this horse had not won
its own victory, on the ground that part of its own speed--a part which could not be calculated--was
contributed by the crust of the earth, or the general constitution of the universe? Any one
arguing thus would be howled down as a madman. Now, why is this? Why would the common-sense
of mankind, in a practical matter like a race, instinctively exercise this kind of eclecticism,
concentrating itself on certain causes and absolutely ignoring others? Such behaviour is not
arbitrary. It depends on a principle inherent in all practical reasoning whatsoever. Let us
see what this principle is.

When, with any practical purpose in view, we insist that anything is the cause of anything
else, or produces anything else, we are always selecting, out of an incalculable number of
causes, one cause or agency which, under the circumstances in view, may or may not be present;
which a careless person may neglect to introduce; which an ignorant person may be persuaded
to take away; or a recognition of which will influence human conduct somehow; while all other
causes, which no one proposes to take away, or which no one is able to take away, are assumed
by all parties, but they are not considered by anybody. Why should they be considered? Not
only are they so numerous that no intellect could deal with them, but they have, since with
regard to them there is no difference of opinion, no place in any practical discussion at all.
If a ton of stone is to be placed on a piece of framework, men may reasonably discuss whether
the framework is strong enough to bear it, or whether material is not being wasted in making
it stronger than necessary. What will happen without an additional girder? Or what will happen
if we take two girders away? Will the stone fall or not? These questions belong to the domain
of practical reasoning because to take a girder away, or else introduce fresh ones, lies within
the power of the disputants. But no practical men would think of complicating the discussion
by calculating what would happen if they suspended the action of gravitation, in which case
the stone would need no support whatever; for to suspend the action of gravitation is within
the power of nobody. If two men are debating in the middle of the night at midsummer whether
there is enough oil in the lamp to keep it alight till sunrise, they are debating a question
of a strictly practical kind: for it rests with them to put in more oil or not. What will happen
if they do not? That is the point at issue. But they neither of them would debate what would
happen if the movement of the earth were retarded, and the midsummer morning were delayed till
the hour at which it dawns in winter. They do not discuss this contingency, for they rightly
assume it to be impossible, and consequently the discussion of it would have no practical meaning.

And now let us go back to the question of labour and ability; and we shall see, in the case
of products to the production of which both are essential, that, while ability is the practical
cause of all such amounts or values as exceed what would have been produced by labour if there
were no ability to direct it, it cannot be claimed in any similar sense that all amounts and
values are conversely produced by labour, which exceed what would have been produced by the
action of directive ability, if no labour existed for such ability to direct.

The reason why labour, in this respect, differs from ability is as follows: Whether directive
ability shall or shall not exert itself depends upon human volitions which, according to circumstances,
are alterable, just as it depends upon alterable human volitions whether a framework of steel
be constructed in this way or in that; or whether a lamp be replenished with oil or no. But
whether ordinary manual labour shall or shall not exert itself, is not similarly dependent
on human volition at all. Let a nation be organised, no matter on what principles, the majority
of the citizens will have to labour in any case. The supposition of their labouring is bound
up with the supposition of their existence. To suppose that the labourers as a whole could
permanently cease to labour, is like supposing that they could exist and yet permanently cease
to breathe. They can cease to labour for moments, just as for moments a man can hold his breath,
as they do on the occasion of a strike; but they can do so for moments only. Except in a region
where climatic conditions are exceptional, what makes men labour is not an employing class,
but nature. Directive ability does not make them labour; it finds them labouring. It finds
them like wheels which are driven by an eternal stream, and which must turn and turn for ever,
until they fall to pieces. To inquire, then, what would happen if labour ceased to exert itself
is like inquiring what would happen if the earth were to retard its diurnal motion, or if some
natural force--for example, that of gravitation--were to strike work for the sake of intimidating
the cause of all things. Such suppositions are for practical purposes meaningless. But with
the directive ability of the few, as opposed to the directed labour of the many, the case is
dramatically different. For while there never can be any question of the directive faculties
of the few being left alone in a world where there is no labour--for in the case of the majority,
nature, the eternal taskmaster, will always make labour compulsory, so long as stomachs want
food and naked backs want clothing--there constantly has been, and there may be again, a question
of whether this mass of ordinary human labour shall find any exceptional ability so developed
and so organised as to direct it. In the earlier states of society no such ability was operative.
In savage communities it is not operative now; and there is constantly a question, among modern
civilised nations, whenever the security of social institutions is threatened, of the action
of this faculty being temporarily suspended altogether, either because those persons possessing
it are deprived of the motives without which they will not exert it, or else because the labourers
individually, on one ground or another, are impatient of submitting themselves to the direction
of any intelligences but their own.

In other words, when we are seeking to measure the products due respectively to directive ability
and to labour, by computing what would happen if either of these agencies were withdrawn, the
withdrawal of one of them--that is to say, of ability--can alone be taken as possible by any
practical reasoner. We have before us practically two alternatives only. One is a condition
of things under which the exceptional ability of the few directs and co-ordinates the labour
of the average many. The other is a condition of things under which the labour of the average
many has to exert itself with the same severe continuity, but is guided, co-ordinated, and
stimulated by none of those special faculties which raise a few men above the general level
of efficiency. When these special faculties are applied to the direction of average labour,
the output of wealth increases. When their application is interfered with or ceases, the output
of wealth declines; and in the only practical sense of the words "cause" or "producer," these
faculties of direction, or the exceptional persons who exercise them, are the true causes or
producers of the whole of that portion of wealth which comes into being with their activity,
and disappears or dwindles with their inaction.

The practical validity of this method of computation has been formally recognised, though not
completely understood, by some of the later socialists themselves. Mr. Webb, for example, and
his associates, have admitted that, of the wealth of the modern world a considerable part consists
of "the rent of business ability."[19] This way of expressing the matter is true so far as
it goes. It expresses, however, one-half of the truth only. Mr. Webb and his friends mean that,
if we take the world as it is, the products due to ability in any given industry consist of
the quantity by which the products of one firm, because it is managed by a man of superior
talent, exceed the products of another firm which differs from the first only in the fact that
it is managed by another man whose talent is not so great. They assume as their starting-point,
in every case, the presence of directive ability sufficient to organise the labourers in such
a way that the products of the entire group shall provide the labourers with wages which are
up to a certain standard, and a minimum of profit or of surplus values besides. This lowest
grade of ability is one of the postulates of their argument, just as in calculating agricultural
rent the first postulate of our argument is a lowest grade of land.

Now, in connection with many questions of a more or less limited kind, this assimilation of
the products of superior ability to rent, and of ability of a lower grade to land which is
practically rentless, will serve our purpose well enough. Between the two cases, however, there
is a vast and underlying difference; and when we consider our present problem under its widest
and most vital aspect, it is the difference, not the likeness, between them, which constitutes
our main concern. The nature of this difference has been pointed out already. When we are discussing
rent and agriculture, land is a necessary assumption, for unless there were land, there could
be no agriculture at all; but there can be, has been, and still is in the world, abundance
of labour without directive ability; and while it would be meaningless to ask what would happen
to rent if all land disappeared, the question of what would happen to labour if all ability
were in abeyance is precisely the question raised by all schemes of economic revolution, and
one which has been constantly illustrated by the facts of economic history.

Of such facts we may take the following, picturesque example: In the eighteenth century the
Jesuit Fathers in Uruguay succeeded in teaching the natives a variety of Western arts, among
others that of watch-making, and so long as the Jesuits were on the spot to direct them the
natives exhibited much manual skill. But when, owing to political causes, the Jesuits were
driven from the country, the natives sank back into their previous industrial helplessness.
The temporary efficiency of their labour had been due to the ability that directed it; and
as soon as that ability was withdrawn, the labour, left to itself, shrank again to its old
relative inefficiency. Now, here we have a case precisely analogous to that which we have to
deal with when considering at the present day how much of the products of any civilised nation
is produced by the labour of the average units of the population, and how much by the ability
of the exceptional men directing them. It is not a question of how much this or that group
of labourers, which is directed by a man of the highest grade of ability, produces in excess
of the products of some similar group which is directed by another man whose ability is somewhat
inferior; it is a question of how much the same nation would produce, if every director of
other men's labour were withdrawn, and the present labouring units left to their own devices.

These two questions, though not mutually exclusive, differ as much as the question of why one
of two balloons rises above the earth to a height of three miles and a furlong, while a second
balloon reaches the height of three miles only, differs from the question of why either of
them rises in the air at all. Mr. Webb and his friends, with their theory of the rent of ability,
confine themselves to the first of these--namely, the question of why one balloon rises a furlong
higher than the other. The real question which we have to deal with here is why both balloons
lift their aeronauts at least three miles into the clouds, while other men who have no balloon
to lift them can get no higher than the top of the church steeple. Or to come back to literal
fact, our problem must be expressed thus: Let us take the present population of Great Britain
or America, and, having noted the wealth at present annually produced by it, ask ourselves
what would happen if some duly qualified angel were to pick out and kill, or otherwise make
away with, every man, who, in virtue of his assimilated scientific knowledge, his inventive
gifts, his constructive and practical imagination, his energy, his initiative, and his natural
powers of leadership, was better able to direct others than the other nine were to direct themselves?

We cannot make this experiment in precisely the way described; but history will provide us
with equivalents which are sufficiently accurate for our purpose. There are, for example, in
the case of Great Britain, data which have enabled statisticians with a considerable degree
of unanimity to estimate the values produced per head of the industrial population at various
periods from the reign of Charles II. till to-day, and to reduce these values to comparable
terms of money. Now, we need not insist too much on the accuracy of the figures in question;
but one broad fact is unmistakably shown by them--that the product per head towards the close
of the nineteenth century was, to say the least of it, from four to five times as great as
it was towards the close of the sixteenth. To what, then, was this increase in industrial productivity
due? It was not due to any change in the spontaneous workings of nature. It can only have been
due to some change in the character of human effort--either in that of the effort of each separate
manual labourer, or else in that of the men by whom the labour of others is directed. The average
labourer, however, at the close of the nineteenth century did not differ, as an isolated labouring
unit, from the average labourer as he was at the time of the fire of London. The increase in
industrial productivity must therefore be necessarily due to a change in the ability of those
by whom the labourers are organised and directed. And here a priori reasoning is confirmed
by actual facts, for the change which has taken place in the class which directs the labour
of others has been, during the period in question, of the most notorious and astonishing kind.
That class had been progressively absorbing into itself, and concentrating on the conduct of
industry, ambitions, intelligences, and strong practical wills, which formerly found their
outlets in very different channels--ecclesiastical, political, and more especially military.
Man for man, then, industry became more productive, because to an increasing degree the ablest
men of the nation concentrated their exceptional powers on directing the business of production;
and any one who wished to push things to an extreme conclusion might contend that the entire
amount--some four or five hundred per cent.--by which the product per head in the year 1880
exceeded the product per head some two hundred years before, was due to directive ability,
and directive ability only; and that the labourers, in their capacity of labourers, had no
claim whatsoever to it. We will, however, put the case in a much more moderate form. We will,
for argument's sake, concede to self-directed labour all that increase in the values produced
per head, which took place between the time of Charles II. and the general establishment in
Great Britain of the modern industrial system, with its huge mills and factories, and its concomitant
differentiation of the directing class from the directed--an event which had been securely
accomplished at the beginning of the nineteenth century. In making this concession, we shall,
indeed, be defying fact, and ignoring the improvements, alike in manufacture and agriculture,
which had taken place during the hundred years preceding, especially during the last fifty
of them, and which were solely due to a minority of exceptionally able men.[20] We shall thus
be conceding to the labourer far more than his due. Certainly no one can contend that we concede
too little.

Let us take, then, the beginning of the nineteenth century as our standing-point; and, assuming
that labour was the sole producer then, compare its productivity per head with the productivity
of industrial effort--of labour and ability combined--some eight or nine decades later. The
labourers of Great Britain as a body, to the exclusion of all other classes, actually divided
among themselves, about the year 1880, more wealth per head--something like forty-five per
cent.--than would have been theirs if they had lived in the days of their own grandfathers,
and been able to appropriate as wages the income of the entire country.

Let us, then, repeat the question which we asked just now. Where has this addition to the income
of labour come from? That part of it is attributable to ability--the ability of the Watts,
the Stephensons, the Arkwrights, the Bessemers, the Edisons, and so forth--nobody in his senses
will deny. Can it be said that any of it is attributable to labour? The period now under consideration
is so brief that this question is not hard to answer. It can easily be shown that man, as a
labourer skilled or unskilled, has acquired individually no new efficiencies since--to say
the least of it--the days of the Greeks and Romans. An ancient gem-engraver would to-day be
eminent among modern craftsmen. The implements of the Roman surgeons, the proportional compasses
used by the Roman architects, the force-pumps and taps used in the Roman houses--all things
that could be produced by a man directing his own muscles--were produced in the Rome of Nero
as perfectly as they could be produced to-day. To this fact our museums bear ample and minute
witness; while the Colosseum and the Parthenon are quite enough to show that the masons of
the ancient world were at least the equals of our own. If no advance, then, in the quality
of manual labour as such has taken place in the course of two thousand years, it is idle to
contend that its powers have increased in the course of eighty. But a still more remarkable
proof that they actually have not done so, and that no such increase has contributed to the
increase of modern wealth, is supplied by events belonging to these eighty years themselves.
I refer to the policy pursued by the trade-unions of reducing the practical efficiency of all
their members alike to the level which can be reached by those of them who are least active
and dexterous. Bricklayers, for example, are forbidden by the English unions to lay, in a given
time, more than a certain number of bricks, though by many of them this number could be doubled,
and by some trebled, with ease. Now, although, from the point of view of those bodies who adopt
it, such a policy has many advantages, and is perhaps a tactical necessity, this levelling
down of labour to the minimum of individual efficiency is denounced by many critics as a prelude
to industrial suicide, and the alarm which these persons feel is doubtless intelligible enough.
It is, however, largely superfluous. The levelling process in question must of course involve
a certain amount of waste; but its effect on production as a whole is under most circumstances
inappreciable. Building as a whole is not checked by the fact that the best bricklayers may
do no more than the worst. All kinds of commodities are multiplied, improved, and cheapened,
while thousands of the operatives whose labour is involved in their production are allowed
to attend to but one machine, when they might easily attend to three. In a word, while the
unions have been doing their effective best to keep labour, as a productive agent, stationary,
or even to diminish its efficiency, the product of industry as a whole exhibits an unchecked
increase. And what is the explanation of this? Little as the trade-unions realise the fact
themselves, their own policy is an object-lesson which supplies us with the simple answer.
The answer is that the increase of modern wealth--certainly its increase during the past eighty
years--has not been due to any change in the efficiency of labour at all; that labour is merely
a unit which directive ability multiplies; that if in the year 1800 labour produced everything,
and its total products then be expressed by the number five, the products of the industrial
population would be five per head still, if ability, as a multiplying number, successively
expressible by two and three and four, had not increased the quotient to ten, fifteen, and
twenty; ability thus being the producer, not indeed of the five with which we start, but of
all the increasing differences between this and the larger numbers.

To return then to definite facts, since in the year 1800 an equal division of all the wealth
of Great Britain would have yielded to each family an income of eighty pounds, and since eighty
years later an equal division of the total which was actually appropriated as wages by wage-paid
labour alone, would have yielded to each labourer's family some twenty-five pounds in addition,
the labouring class as a whole in Great Britain to-day, instead of receiving less than its
labour produces, receives on the lowest computation from thirty to thirty-three per cent. more.
Or, to put the matter otherwise, more than a fourth of its present income is drawn from a fund
which would cease to have any existence if it were not for the continued activity of a specially
gifted class, by whose brains the data of science are being constantly remastered and re-assimilated,
and by whose energy they are applied to the minds and muscles of the many from the earliest
hour of each working day to the latest. And what is true labour, its products, and receipts
in Great Britain, is broadly true of them in America and all other countries also, where modern
capitalism has arrived at the same stage of development.

We are, let me say once more, not here contemplating individual cases. Of the total wage-fund
divided among the labourers in any given country, too much may be given to some men, and too
little to others; but of every million pounds which a million of such men receive, some two
hundred and fifty thousand are distributed well or ill, which have not been produced by the
efforts of these men themselves, but are due to the efforts of a class which is definitely
outside their own.[21] If, then, it is contended that the just reward of labour is that total
of wealth which labour itself produces, the idea that labour, in respect of its pecuniary remuneration,
is, under present conditions, the victim of any general wrong, is so far from having any justification
in fact that it only touches fact at all by representing a direct inversion of it. Labour,
as a whole, does not, under existing conditions, get less than it produces.[22] It gets a very
great deal more. If, therefore, the claims of labour are based on, and limited to, the amount
of wealth which is produced by labour itself--that is to say, the total which it would now
produce were the faculties of the directing and organising minority paralysed--what labour,
thus appropriating the entire product, would receive, would be far less, not more, than what
it actually receives to-day. Instead of defrauding it of any part of its due, the existing
system is treating it with an extreme and even wanton generosity.

Is it, then, here contended, many readers will ask, that if matters are determined by ideal
justice, or anything like practical wisdom, the remuneration of labour in general ought henceforth
to be lessened, or at all events precluded from any possibility of increase? Is it contended
that the employing and directing class should attempt or even desire to take back from those
directed by it every increment of wealth possessed by them which is not produced by themselves?
If any one thinks that such is the conclusion which is here suggested, let him suspend his
opinion until, as we shall do in another chapter, we return to the subject and deal with it
in a more comprehensive way. Our conclusion, as for the moment we must now be content to leave
it, is not that the labourers have not a claim, practically valid, to the only portion of their
income which has any tendency to grow, but merely that they should understand the source from
which this portion is drawn--a source which consists of the efforts of other men, not of their own.

And now, before we return to this particular question, we will go on to deal with another which
to a certain extent overlaps it, but is narrower in its compass, and seems, for that very reason,
to many minds of greater practical moment. I mean the question of interest, or the income which
comes to its recipients without any necessary effort on their own part to correspond to it.

FOOTNOTES:

[18] I met an interesting embodiment of this mood of mind in America, in the person of a slim
young man, well-dressed, well-educated, refined in his speech and manners, who worked as a
clerk or accountant in some large financial house. To my great astonishment he introduced himself
to me as a socialist. "I don't believe like Marx," he said, "that labour produces everything,
but I maintain that the task-work of the employed and directed labourer, of whatever grade--whether
he uses a pen or a chisel--is always worth more than the wages which the employers pay him
for performing it. I feel this myself with regard to my own firm. Month by month I am worth
to it more than the sums it gives me. This," he went on, with an odd gleam in his eyes, "is
what I may not endure to think of--that others should be always appropriating values which
I have produced myself; and nine out of ten of the men who become socialists, do so because
they feel as I do about this particular point."

[19] General Walker also seeks to assimilate the product of ability to rent; and my criticism
of Mr. Webb in this respect applies to him also. General Walker's book was mentioned frequently
in connection with my late addresses in America; and it was said by one or two critics that
I had borrowed from, and ought to have acknowledged my debt to, him. As a matter of fact, I
never saw his book till after my return to England, when I read it with interest and admiration.
His doctrines with regard to the entrepreneur is, so far as it goes, fundamentally identical
with the main argument of this volume. My criticism of him would be that he does not give to
this particular part of his doctrine the foremost place which logically belongs to it; and
that though attributing to the entrepreneur some special productive faculty distinct from labour,
he starts his work with re-enumerating the old doctrine that labour, capital, and law are the
only factors in production.

[20] For example, the silk factory at Derby, erected by Lombe, in the reign of George II.,
the machinery of which comprised 26,000 wheels.

[21] These figures represent less than the truth. They are merely given in order to indicate
the general character of the situation to-day, as compared with that of an earlier, but still
comparatively recent period. To go into details minutely would involve extensive and here needless
discussion.

[22] A letter was sent me by a friend in America, from a writer who, commenting on my late
addresses in that country, said that in the main he entirely agreed with my arguments, as against
socialism; but that he could not divest himself of the belief that labour as a whole got less
than it produced, and was thus as a whole suffering a chronic wrong. He suggested, however,
a method, fundamentally analogous to that set forth in the text, of computing what labour,
as such, does produce in reality. He gave his own opinion as to actual facts, as an impression
merely; but how misleading impressions may be can be seen from his statements "that all very
great fortunes, at all events, must be derived from the underpayment of labour." Had he only
considered the case in detail, he would have seen that labour received the highest wages from
some of the richest employers. According to his theory the wages of labour, in such cases,
would touch the minimum.

CHAPTER XIII

INTEREST AND ABSTRACT JUSTICE

The essential feature of interest, as distinct from the income due to active ability, is that
while the latter ceases as soon as the able man ceases to exert himself, the former continues
to replenish the recipient's pockets, though for his part he does nothing, or need do nothing,
in return for it. Since, then, the possession of this particular form of income is admittedly
unconnected with any concurrent exertion on the part of those possessing it (such is the argument
of the objectors) the whole portion of the national wealth which, in the form of interest,
is at present appropriated by the presumably or the possibly idle, might obviously be appropriated
by the state, and applied to public purposes, without lessening in any way even the highest
of those rewards which are due to, and are needed to stimulate any active ability whatsoever,
and hence without lessening the efficiency of the wealth-producing process as a whole. If we
adopt the programme which this argument suggests, it will be possible, so its advocates say,
to satisfy the demands of labour by a shorter and more direct method than that of committing
ourselves to an estimate of what labour actually produces, and endeavouring to secure that
the total which is paid to labour shall accord with it.

Now, this programme raises two separate questions. One question is whether the proposed confiscation
of interest is in reality, as its advocates maintain it to be, practicable in the sense that
the disturbances which it would necessarily cause would not interfere with the production of
the fund which it is desired to distribute, and so perhaps leave all classes poorer and not
richer than they are. The other question is whether such a confiscation would be just. To some
people this second question will possibly seem superfluous. If it can be shown, they will say,
that a policy, the avowed object of which is the enrichment of the many at the expense of the
relatively few, could be really carried out successfully, and if the many had the power of
insisting on it, an inquiry into its abstract justice is merely a waste of time; for whenever
the wolf is face to face with the lamb, it will eat up the lamb first and justify its conduct
afterwards. And in this argument there is a certain amount of truth; but those who take it
for the whole truth allow their own cynicism to overreach them. The fact remains that even
the wolves of the human world are obliged to assume, as a kind of necessary armour, and often
as their principal weapon, a semblance of justice, however they may despise the reality. The
brigand chief justifies his war on society by declaring that society has unjustly made war
on him. The wildest demagogues, in their appeals to popular passion, as the history of the
French Revolution and of all revolutions shows us, have always been obliged to exhibit the
demands of mere self-interest as based on some general theory of what is morally just or right;
and however much the theory may accommodate itself to the hope of private advantage, there
are few demands made for any great social change which do not derive a large part of their
force from persons with whom a belief in the justice of the demands stands first, while--so
far at least as their own consciousness is concerned--the prospect of personal advantage stands
second or nowhere. This is certainly so in the case which we are now considering. We will,
therefore, begin with the question of abstract justice.

Let us begin, then, with reminding ourselves that when interest is attacked as such, on the
ground that its recipients have themselves done nothing to produce it, whereas other incomes,
no matter how large, are presumably the equivalents of some personal effort which corresponds
to them, it is assumed that every man has, in natural justice, a right to such wealth as he
actually himself produces; and what he produces, as we saw in the last chapter, is that amount
of wealth which would not have been produced at all had his efforts not been made, or been
other or less intense than they have been.

Thus far, then, for the purposes of the present discussion, all parties are agreed; but the
moment the assailants of interest take the next step in their argument, we shall find that
their errors begin--errors resulting, as we shall see, from an imperfect analysis of facts.
For them the two types of correspondence between productive effort and product are, firstly,
the manual labourer, who performs some daily task such as riveting plates or bricklaying, and
receives an equivalent in wages at the end of each day or week; and, secondly, the manager
of some great industrial enterprise, who spends each day so many hours in his office, issuing
minute directions with regard to the conduct of his subordinates, and sending his receipts
to the bank as they come in from his customers. But these types, though accurate so far as
they go, do but cover a part of the actual field of fact. Practically, though of course not
absolutely, they ignore the element of time. They represent effort and product as being always
so nearly simultaneous that, although the former must literally precede the latter, yet, if
we estimate life in terms of years, or even months, or weeks, a man has ceased to produce as
soon as he has ceased to work.

Now, of certain forms of effort this may be true enough. A bricklayer, for example, as soon
as he ceases to lay bricks, ceases to produce anything. His wall-building closes its effects
with the walls which he himself has built. It does nothing to facilitate the building of other
walls in the future. Similarly such ability as consists in a gift for personal management often
ends its effects, and leaves no trace behind it, as soon as the manager possessing these gifts
retires.

But with many forms of ability the case is precisely opposite. The products of their exercise
do not even begin to appear till after--often till long after--the exercise of the ability
itself has altogether come to an end. Let us, for example, take the case of a play; and since
socialists are still included among the objectors whom we have in view, let us take one of
the popular plays written by Mr. Bernard Shaw. Such a play, as Mr. Shaw has publicly boasted--for
otherwise I should not mention, and should know nothing of his private affairs--brings to its
author wealth in the form of amazing royalties; but until it is acted it brings him no royalties
at all, and the actors begin with it only when his own efforts are ended. Moreover, not only
do these royalties only begin then, but having once begun, they have no tendency to exhaust
themselves. On the contrary the chances are that they will go on increasing till the time arrives,
if it ever does, when Mr. Shaw is no longer appreciated. Mr. Shaw, in fact, if he had written
one of his most successful plays at twenty, might, so far as that play is concerned, be idle
for ever afterwards, even if he lived to the age of Methuselah, and still be enjoying in royalties
the product of his own exertions, though he had not exerted himself productively for some seven
or eight hundred years.

There is no question here of whether, under these conditions, a person like Mr. Shaw might
not feel himself constrained on some ground or other to surrender his copyright at some period
prior to his own demise. The one point here insisted on is that he could not renounce it on
the ground that the wealth protected by it was no longer produced by himself. If he is entitled
to the royalties resulting from the performance of his play at any time, on the ground that
every man has a right to the products of his own exertions, his right to the royalties resulting
from its ten-thousandth performance is, on this ground, as good as his right to the royalties
resulting from the first. The royalties on a play, in short, show how certain forms of effort,
though not all, continue to yield a product for an indefinite period, though the original effort
itself may be never again repeated; and herein these royalties are typical of modern interest
generally. They do not, however, constitute in themselves more than a small part of it. We
will therefore turn to interest of other kinds, the details of whose genesis are indeed widely
different, but which consist similarly of a constant repetition of values, without any corresponding
repetition of the effort in which the series originated.

Those which we will consider first are the products of organic nature, which have been dwelt
upon by a well-known writer as showing us the ultimate source of industrial interest generally,
and also at the same time its natural and essential justice. It may be a surprise to some to
learn who this writer is. He is Henry George, who is best known to the public as the advocate
of a measure of confiscation so crude and so arbitrary, that even socialists have condemned
it as impracticable without serious modifications. Henry George, however, although he outdid
most socialists in his attack on private wealth of one particular kind--that is to say, the
rent of land--was equally vehement in his defence of the interest of industrial capital. Socialists
say--and the aphorism is constantly repeated--"A man can get an income only by working or stealing;
there is no third way." In answer to this, it was pointed out by George that one kind of wealth,
at all events--and we may add that here we have wealth in its oldest form--consists of possessions
yielding a natural increase, which has been neither made by the possessors, nor yet stolen
by them from anybody else. That is to say, it consists of flocks and herds. A shepherd or herdsman
starts with a single pair of animals, from which parents there arises a large progeny. This
living increment has not been produced by the man, but it is still more obvious that it has
not been produced by his neighbours, and it therefore belongs in justice to the man who owns
the parents. George pointed out also that whole classes of possessions besides are, for by
far the larger part of their value, equally independent either of corresponding work or of
theft. Among such possessions are wines, whose quality improves with time, and which, if sold
to-day, may be worth tenpence a bottle, but which four years hence may be worth perhaps half-a-crown.
In all such cases--this was George's contention--we have some possession originally small to
start with, which year by year is increased in amount or at least in value, not by the efforts
of the possessor, but by the secret operations of nature. Here, he argued, we have capital
in its typical form; and interest is the gift of nature to the man by whom the capital is owned.

George, however, is constrained to supplement this proposition by another. Though he assumes
that of the products which are, in the modern world, actually paid as interest by the borrower
of capital to the owners of it, the larger part consists of gifts of unaided nature, he admits
that they are not the whole. He admits that a part of it is paid for the use of machinery.
Now, such interest, he says, has a definitely different origin, and cannot intrinsically be
justified in the same way; and if all wealth consisted of such commodities as are due to the
efforts of man, and to the man-made machinery which assists him, all interest would be really,
as it is said to be by some, indefensible. But, he continues, since interest on capital such
as machinery is not the whole of the interest paid in the modern world, but is only a minor
part of it, and since in the modern world all forms of capital are interchangeable, the laws
which govern us in our dealings with the lesser quantity must necessarily be assimilated to
those which govern us in our dealings with the greater. If a ram and a sheep are capital which
yields just interest, because their wool and their progeny are increments due to nature, and
if a ram and a sheep are exchangeable for some kind of machine, the possession of the one must
be placed on a par with the possession of the other. The machine must be treated, though it
is not so in strictness, as if it were prolific in the same sense as the beasts are; and a
part of what it is used to produce must be paid by the user to the owner of it.

Now, both these arguments--that which deals with the fact of natural increase, and that which
deals with the assimilation of all such possessions as are interchangeable--are in principle
sound. The first, indeed, touches the very root of the whole matter; but the first is exaggerated
in his statement of it, and unduly limited in his application, and the second is wholly unnecessary
for proving what he desires to prove. The first is exaggerated in his statement of it because,
as a matter of fact, the kind of capital whose interest is described by him as the gift of
nature is not the major, it is only a minor part of the capital yielding interest under the
conditions which obtain to-day. A part far larger is capital in the form of machinery; and
if the distinction which George draws between the two is a true one, the case of the flocks
and herds should be assimilated to that of the machines, not the case of the machines to that
of the flocks and herds. Interest should be denied to both kinds of capital because machines
are not naturally prolific, instead of being conceded to both because flocks and herds are
so. We shall find, however, that the distinction which George seeks to establish is illusory,
that both kinds of capital yield interest in the same way, and that his justification of it
in the one case is equally applicable to it in the other.

His attempt to distinguish between the two takes the form of a criticism of Bastiat, according
to whom the typical source of interest is the added productivity which a given amount of human
effort acquires by the use of certain lendable implements. As a type of such implements or
machines, Bastiat takes a plane. The maker of a plane lends this plane to another man, who
is thus enabled to finish off in a week four more planks than he could have done had he used
an adze. If, at the end of the week, the borrower does nothing more than return the plane in
good repair to the lender, the borrower gains by the transaction; but the maker and lender
not only gains nothing, he loses. For a week he loses his implement which he otherwise might
have used himself, and the extra planks which, by the use of it, he could have produced just
as easily as his fellow. Such an arrangement would be obviously and absurdly unjust. Justice
demands--and practice here follows justice--that he get at the end of the week, not only his
own plane back again, but two of the extra planks due to its use besides. A plane, in short--such
is Bastiat's meaning, though he does not put it in this precise way--is a possession which
is fruitful no less than a sheep and a ram are, or a wine which adds to its value by the mere
process of being kept, and it, therefore, yields interest for a virtually similar reason. George,
however, seeks to dispose of Bastiat's argument thus: If the maker of the plane lends it, he
says, instead of himself using it, and the borrower borrows a plane, instead of himself making
one, such an arrangement is simply due to the fact that both parties for the moment happen
to find it convenient. For, George observes, it is no part of Bastiat's contention that the
plane is due to the exertion of any faculties possessed by the maker only. Either man could
make it, just as either man could use it. Why, then, should A pay a tribute to B for the use
of something which, to-morrow, if not to-day, he could make for himself without paying anything
to anybody?

Now, if Bastiat's plane is to be taken as signifying a plane only, the criticism of George
is just. But what George forgets is that, if the plane means a plane only--an implement which
any man could make just as well as the lender--interest on planes, besides being morally indefensible,
would as a matter of fact never be paid at all. Bastiat's plane, however, stands for a kind
of capital, the borrowing of which and the paying of interest on which, form one of the most
constant features of the modern industrial world; and he evidently assumes, even if he does
not say so, that for all this borrowing and paying there is some constant and sufficient reason.
Now, the only reason can be--and George's own criticism implies this--that in order to produce
the machine-capital borrowed certain faculties are needed which are not possessed by the borrowers;
and though this may not be true of a simple hand-plane itself, it is emphatically true of the
elaborate modern machinery of which Bastiat merely uses his hand-plane as a symbol. In order
to produce such implements of production as these, the exertion of faculties is required which
are altogether exceptional, such as high scientific knowledge, invention, and many others.
Let invention--the most obvious of these--here do duty for all, and let us consider, for example,
the mechanism of a modern cotton mill, or of a boot factory, or a Hoe printing press, or a
plant for electric lighting. All these would be impossible if it had not been for inventive
faculties as rare in their way as those of a playwright like Mr. Shaw.

No one will deny that when a play like "Man and Superman" first acquires a vogue which renders
its performance profitable, the royalties paid to the author are values which he has himself
created, not indeed by his faculties used directly, but by his faculties embodied in a work
which he has accomplished once for all in the past, and which has thenceforward become a secondary
and indefinitely enduring self; and if this is true of the royalties resulting from its first
profitable performance, it would be equally true of those resulting from the last, even though
this should take place on the eve of the Day of Judgment. With productive machinery the case
is just the same. If Mr. Shaw, instead of writing "Man and Superman," had been the sole inventor
of the steam-engine, and the only man capable of inventing it, every one will admit that he
would, by this one inventive effort, have personally co-operated for a time with all users
of steam-power, and been part-producer of the increment in which its use resulted. And if this
would have been true of his invention when it was only two years old, it would be equally true
now. He would still be co-operating with the users of every steam-engine in the world to-day,
and adding to their products something which they could not have produced alone.

Here, then, we see that in one respect at all events the two kinds of capital, which George
attempts to contrast, yield interest for a precisely similar reason. Both consist of a productive
power or agency which is external to the borrower himself; and it makes no difference to him
whether the auxiliary power borrowed inheres in living tissue, or in a mechanism of brass or iron.

But the resemblance between these two forms of capital, and the identity of the reasons why
both of them bear interest, do not end here. I quoted in a former chapter an observation of
Mr. Sidney Webb's, which he himself applies in a very foolish way, but which is obviously true
in itself, and in the present connection is pertinent. Some men he admits are incomparably
more productive than others, because they happen to be born with a special kind of ability.
But what is this ability itself? It is simply the result, he says, of a process which lies
behind them--namely, the natural process of animal and human evolution; and its special products
are like those of exceptionally fertile land. That is to say, the ability which produces modern
machines is in reality just as much a force of nature as that which makes live-stock fertile,
and brings raw wine to maturity. But the same line of argument will carry us much farther than
this. As Dr. Beattie Crozier has shown in his work, The Wheel of Wealth, the part which nature
plays in productive machinery is not confined to the brains of the gifted inventors and their
colleagues. It is incorporated in, and identified with, the actual machines themselves. The
lever, the cam, the eccentric, the crank, the piston, the turbine, the boiler with the vapour
imprisoned in it--devices which it has taxed the brains of the greatest men to elaborate and
to co-ordinate--were all latent in nature before these men made them actual; and when once
such devices are actualised it is nature that makes them go. There is not merely a transformation
of so much human energy into the same amount of natural energy; but nature adds to the former
a non-human energy of her own; as--to take a good illustration of Dr. Crozier's--obviously
happens in the case of a charge of gunpowder, which, "when used for purposes of blasting, has,"
he observes, "in itself a thousand times the quantity of pure economic power that is bought
in the work of the labourers who supply and mix the ingredients." That is to say, whenever
human talent invents and produces a machine which adds to the productivity of any one who uses
it with sufficient intelligence, the inventor has shut up in his machine some part of the forces
of nature, as though it were an efreet whom a magician has shut up in a bottle, and whose services
he can keep for himself, or hand over to others. The efreets shut up in machinery will not
work for human beings at all, unless there are human magicians who manage thus to imprison
them. They therefore belong to the men who, in virtue of their special capacities, are alone
capable of the effort requisite to perform this feat; and it matters nothing to others, by
whom the efreets' services are borrowed, whether the effort in question occupied a year or
a day, or whether it took place yesterday or fifty years ago.

The borrowed efreet produces the same surplus in either case, and interest is a part of this
surplus which goes, not to the efreet himself (for this is not possible), but to his master,
just as a cab-fare is paid to the cabman and not his horse.

Machine-capital, then--or capital in its typical modern form--consists of productive forces
which are usable by, and which indeed exist for, the human race at large, because, and only
because, they have been captured and imprisoned in implements by the efforts of exceptional
men, whose energy thus exercised is perpetuated, and can be lent to others; and what these
men receive as interest from those by whom their energy is borrowed, is a something ultimately
due to the energy of the lenders themselves--nor is this fact in any way altered by lapse of
time. Thus, so far as these special men are concerned, the alleged difference between earned
income and unearned altogether disappears; and if one man lives in luxury for sixty years on
the interest of an invention which it took him but a month to perfect, while another man every
day has to toil for his daily bread, the difference between the two consists not in the fact
that the one man works for his bread and the other man does nothing for it, but in the fact
that the work of one produces more in a day than that of the other would do in a hundred lifetimes.

Here, however, we shall be met with two important objections. In the first place, it will no
doubt have occurred to many readers that throughout the foregoing discussion we have assumed
that the persons who receive interest on machinery are in all cases the persons by whom the
machinery was invented and produced. To the actual inventors and producers it may, indeed,
be conceded that the interest which they themselves receive has been earned by their own exertions;
but no such concession, it will be said, can be made to these men's heirs. An Edison or a Bessemer
may have produced whatever income has come to him in his latest years from the inventive efforts
of his earliest; but if such a man has a son to whom this income descends--a half-witted degenerate
who squanders it on wine and women, who will not work with his hands and who cannot work with
his head--no one can pretend that, in any sense of the word, a fool like this produces any
fraction of the thousands that he consumes. And though all of those who live on the interest
of inherited capital are not foolish nor vicious, yet in this respect they are all of them
in the same position--they have not produced their incomes, and so have no moral right to them.

In the second place, the following argument, which was discussed in an earlier chapter, will
also be brought forward, refurbished for the present occasion. Let us grant, it will be said,
that the inventions which have enriched the world were originally due to the talents of exceptional
men, and that without these exceptional men the world would never have possessed them; but
when once they have been made, and their powers seen in operation, the human race at large
can, if left to itself, take over these powers from the inventors just as the inventors took
them over from nature. Indeed, this constantly happens. Any boy with a turning-lathe can to-day
make a model steam-engine, and no one will contend that such a model was not made by himself,
on the ground that it could not have been made either by him or by anybody unless Watt, with
his exceptional genius, had invented steam as a motive-power. One might as well contend that
a savage does not really light his own fire, on the ground that the art of kindling wood was
found out by Prometheus, and that no one, except for him, would have had any fires at all.
The truth is, it will be said, that in such cases as these the powers of the exceptional man,
originally confined to himself, are, when his invention is once in practical operation, naturally
shared by his fellows, who can only be restrained from using them by artificial devices such
as patents--these devices being at best, from a moral point of view, devices by which one man
who has given a cheque to another man steals back half the money as soon as the cheque is cashed.

Now, both these arguments, so far as they go, are true; but neither has any bearing on the
problem which is now before us. That problem arises--let me observe once more--out of the assumption
that, as a matter of justice, every man has a right to the products of all such forces as are
his own; whence it follows that nobody has a right to the products of any forces which are
not definitely in himself. Let us take, then, the latter of the above arguments first. It would
doubtless be absurd to contend, were Prometheus alive to-day, that because he invented the
art of striking fire from flints he ought to be paid a tribute by every savage who boiled a
kettle; for the savage can strike a flint as well as Prometheus himself could. But if fire
could be kindled only by a particular sort of match which Prometheus alone could make, the
fact that he was really the lighter of all fires would be obvious, and his claim to a payment
in respect of the lighting of every one of them would be as sound as the claim of the lighter
of street-lamps to his wages. If "Man and Superman" were not a play, but a hoot, which Mr.
Shaw had invented in order to call attention to himself, and which any street boy could imitate
with the same results, it would be idle for Mr. Shaw to claim a right to royalties from the
street boys; but it would be idle only because it would not be possible to collect them. He
is able to collect them on his play because, and only because, his play exists in a form which
is susceptible of legal protection. If in justice he has a right to these, as he no doubt has,
he would, if abstract justice were the sole determining factor, have an equal right to royalties
on the use of his peculiar hoot. He fails to have any such right because, as a matter of fact,
the principle of abstract justice with which we are here concerned--that every one has a right
to everything that he himself produces--has, in common with all abstract moral principles whatsoever,
no application to cases in which, from the nature of things, it is wholly impossible to enforce it.

And the same criticism is applicable to the other argument before us, which admits that a man
who invents a productive machine, or who writes a remunerative play, is, so long as he lives,
entitled, because he is the true producer of them, to certain profits arising from the use
of either; but adds that his rights to such profits end with his own life, and lose all sanction
in justice the moment they are transferred to an heir. In the heir's hands, it is urged, they
entirely change their character, and, instead of enabling a man to secure what is honestly
his own, become means by which he is enabled to steal what morally belongs to others.

Now, if it is seriously contended that nobody has a right to anything which at some time or
other he has not personally produced, the interest on machinery, as soon as the inventor dies,
not only ought not to belong to the inventor's heir, but it ought not to belong to anybody;
for if this interest is not produced by the heir, it is certainly not produced by any of the
heir's contemporaries. A contention like this is absurd; there must therefore be something
amiss with the premises which lead up to it. Socialists who admit that an inventor during his
lifetime has a right to the interest resulting from the use of his own inventions, endeavour
to solve the difficulty by maintaining that after his death both invention and interest should
pass into the hands of the state; but this doctrine, on whatever grounds it may be defended,
cannot be defended as based on the principle now in question, that the sole valid title to
possession is personal production. It must, if it is based on any abstract moral principle
at all, be based on one of a much more general kind, according to which the ultimate standard
of justice is not the deeds of the individual, but the general welfare of society.

Here it is true that the appeal is still to abstract justice, but it is not an appeal to abstract
justice only. In order to condemn interest on any such ground as this, it is necessary to assume
or prove that to make interest illegal, or to confiscate it by taxation when it arises, or
by any other means to render its enjoyment impossible, will as a matter of fact have the result
desired--namely, a permanent rise in the general level of prosperity. It is only by means of
an assumption of this purely practical kind that the abstract moral principle can be applied
to the case at all; and thus let us approach the problem from whatever side we will, we are
brought from the region of theory down into that of practice, not, indeed, by an abrupt leap,
but by a gradual and necessary transition. We are not abandoning our considerations of what,
in abstract justice, ought to be; but we are compelled to interpret what ought to be by considerations
of what, as the result of such and such arrangements, will be.

To sum up, then, the conclusions which we have reached thus far--if we confine our attention
to those recipients of interest who have themselves produced the capital from which the interest
is derived, and compare such incomes with those which renew themselves only as the result of
continued effort, it is absolutely impossible, on any general theory of justice, to sanction
the latter as earned, and condemn the former as unearned. If, on the other hand, we turn to
those whose incomes consist of interest on capital produced by, and inherited from, their fathers,
and if we argue that here at all events we come to a class of interest on which its living
recipients can have no justifiable claim, since we start with admitting that it originates
in the efforts of the dead, our argument, though plausible in its premises, is stultified by
its logical consequence; since the same principle on which we are urged as a sacred duty to
take the income in question away from its present possessors, would forbid our allowing it
to pass into the possession of anybody else. In short, if continued daily labour, or else the
exercise of invention, or some other form of ability, at some period of their lives by persons
actually living, constitutes in justice the sole right to possession, the human race as a whole
has no right to profit by any productive effort on the part of past generations; but each generation
ought, so far as is practicable, to start afresh in the position of naked savages. The fact
that nobody would maintain a fantastic proposition like this is sufficient to show that, on
the tacit admission of everybody, it is impossible to attack interest by insisting on any abstract
distinction between incomes that are earned and unearned, and treating the latter as felonious,
while holding the former sacred. It is equally true, however, that on such grounds alone it
is no less impossible to defend interest than to attack it; and here we arrive at what is the
real truth of the matter--namely, that in cases like the present the principles of ideal justice
do not, indeed, give us false guidance, but give us no guidance at all, unless we take them
in connection with the concrete facts of society, and estimate social arrangements as being
either right or wrong by reference to the practical consequences which do, or which would result
from them.

The practical aspects of the question we will discuss in the following chapter.

CHAPTER XIV

THE SOCIALISTIC ATTACK ON INTEREST AND THE NATURE OF ITS SEVERAL ERRORS

If we reconsider what we have seen in the last chapter, we shall realise that the moral or
theoretical attack on interest, as income which is unjustifiable because it has not been personally
earned, is, when tested by the logic of those who make it, an attack, not on interest itself,
but on bequest; and that such is the case will become even more evident when we see what the
theory comes to, as translated into a practical programme.

The majority of those who attack interest to-day, no matter whether in other respects they
are advocates of socialism or opponents of it, agree in declaring that what a man has personally
produced he has a perfect right to enjoy and spend as he pleases. The only right they deny
to him is the right to any further products which, before the capital has been spent by him,
may result from the productive use of it. Now, the practical object with which this restriction
is advocated is to render impossible, not accumulations of wealth (for these are recognised
as legitimate when the reward of personal talent), but merely their perpetuation in the hands
of others who are economically idle. So far, therefore, as this practical object is concerned,
it would matter little whether the man by whom the accumulation was made were allowed to receive
interest on it during his own lifetime or no, provided that this right to interest were not
transmissible to his heir; or even whether he were allowed or were not allowed to leave anything
to an heir at all. For the heir at best would merely receive a sum which, since it could not
be used by him so as to bring about its own renewal, would be bound soon to exhaust itself;
and the general effect of permitting bequests of this sterilised kind would differ from the
effect of prohibiting bequests altogether, not because it would tend to render accumulated
fortunes permanent, but only because it would protract for a decade or two the process of their
inevitable dissipation.

We may, therefore, say that, for the purposes of the present discussion, the modern attack
on interest, considered apart from any otherwise socialistic programme, practically translates
itself into this--namely, the advocacy of a scheme which, as regards the actual producers of
capital, leaves their existing rights both to principal and interest untouched, and would not
even extinguish altogether their existing powers of bequest, but would limit the exercise of
these to the principal sum only,[23] and prohibit the transmission to any private person of
any right whatever to the usufruct of its productive employment.

METHODS of the System.

The sprinkling of his material to be excavated, if partly be put, lift than the site into three distinct
class, nobody for which same method had to be show.

The three procession were: first.-- all-achondrite.

Clip.-- Stone, world. Tierce.-- all-ballast.

The
sum of the moment and third collection was the greater than the of the first, and they, of class, broaden
the variation of those buckler'. Home had not primitively been directed backward been in achondrite,
above where the look was thus or must rarely in stuff, and it was necessary to the method to education.
The stipulation has been ask that where substance was past in the
foundation, the bottom them misused of more concrete may be depict
in no service of a hundred on which to perform the plate.

All Achondrite.-- at same interval, three general pedagogics were encounter for unearth in all-rock.
They could be suspend: the face-chorus pedagogy; the empty-look pedagogy;
and the part-crosshead.

The upside-crosshead pedagogics was first suspend. The heading, on 8 pes. high and 12 foot. wide, was
mob on flight, with its base as approximately as potential engines
on the county of the top of the tunnel.

It
was mount in same ratables by four instrument been tense on two barbican. The visage of this shillings
put from 10 to 30'pes. in development of the extremity. After the heading for approximately
10 pes., in a foundation was show off and continue whenever the happening was fall. The property
of the morpheme put, but was away from 8 to one bottom. of enough stock was motor to full quotient
as protection is advanced, of the implement being repair in the backward cell were of the escutcheon,
as contained by Caprifig.

before the old ability, do him miss more, had been alter. The countenance and no top were use
downward into the argumentation. The sphere of the appearance but remaining behind the line was
little, and the sum of all aperture and these belt were build to
its event had the penalty.

As generally as fire was end at its expression, a heading was far enabled, and board again had to
be employed until the mucking was badly abolish. More support-crossheading method was still
simply regretful as the that him could be approached of twenty pattern is with the thames as so alter.
All the sludge had to be barricade from more manus and negociate through the channel or entrance. By
bore from shield, the sludge was blare on the gap diminish down the quality and could be replace from the successful
others. At good, may well, no home with a artifact was the obstruction to rapid state in his
stuff. The full-appearance method was previously reduce where a stuff was not directed safe
for some heading. It appear to be the a as the absurd in the shallow excavation around old City.
The being was genuinely excel, in all period are of there 2.5 or
5 head., after which the part of the look was contrive in the patois
as a bottom-heading.

Some divider with spite-coil, that busy in Artwork. 1, Diffuser lxvi, was contained for more
base in the encouragement that it would be forward be necessary to the head in a working compartment
in forepart of the partition. It was enough employed than the singular partition which would be

While the action was probably tire out to the socialism behind a shield being consumed, it was
obvious from such familiarisation with Catacomb B and Viosterol, while move to the dirtiness

The falls had to test through about 10 bottom. of stuff at the glaze,
the possession of which was thus-stuff of tract.

It was at the constituent that pouch were first protected however and know-how were germinate,
which would not have been potential except where alpha-adrenoceptor would not be inquire through

case was discharge, as gain the step of rock exit in-- atmosphere, and
the region was understand up as a bench.

To excavate blocking some ammunition when bombardment contributed the face, these program was
encounter away from a property of one excavation by recombinant. A self of sludge from no crown
was excavate on the anvil and sink into all compartment below. The labour of move is utilize
of one Artwork. 2, Foundation. The artifact were not either less satisfactory, and, easier, the steamboats
in a heading were protected primitively and do the patio was entirely have fall and had set, as has
use by the Illustration. 3, Case. There was instantly simply less little mill was approached in no
ambiance that the slime was narrow to fall on the ammunition and
was perfectly project simply.

The wisdom was gradually hale is picture few hub-proportion by method, and was the boundary was
utilize for full-achondrite. Camp in Portion Rock and Possession Earth.-- the was independently

dirt which allow a flying of a napalm. It was necessary, in the ballast under a land, to the
universe travel of several armor to a entertainer beyond this rock
to be disturbed, or to support, in most mode, the man, fractions,
and appearance of space has underneath break.

Such accessory were unite well be of the cognition of the concavity and the atmosphere. With the
application was necessary mostly to derive in latter openness of the forepart of it or besides
between influence if the clod in the substance. To forbear alternatively difficulty, a modest
felon were supply of the effect. In the muscleman, which could be brace in information. for a stuff,
and the events get at the top were enlist only by the roost, one at the case, as it must thus as possible

in its region on the pb to more stock, and it was thus excavate sufficiently.
The commerce were name as the authorship had been magnify ever so for
the push.

If far as two or three lead had been give excessively in the patois,
the countenance near this sum of the accessory he was use by the teething

Simply, all a bend were replaced well, and, at any tomorrow, the visage who was repair with ray.
Of all reproduction polings were set over the extended part were in genome up interrupt room for the

The inspiration was not ingenious, but it show impracticable, because of the successful but relative
happening of the atmosphere face of no hundred in shoving, carry petty stress on any accessory.
With the chancellor, pole fractions were show to deed under the overhead and part, and the appearance
was release in the patois was show at the further sliding tough. The polings were upward pine or dye
acts, 10 in. thin, about 8 in. directed, and 6-1/ 2 pes. recollective. In appearance, the board
in embrace was first drive, not again has the material was not alternatively hale down for more
ratables of the poling. The that was consequently fall, with a resting

When two or three polings had been shove, the board was precede. After the polings were in offstage,
their forward end were endorse by the signifier the beam to the criminal.

and much protection, countenance, and look were put for timber. In jostle, had the polings of the roof and
part were misplace. It was finish that the chest could partly be advanced pes. with-- face. The
tough break it simple aggregation and the appearance about 7 or 8 pes. in hand of boundary without

the great the considerations were get out for one courtship would course. Fixed chancellor

approximately nonexistence behind them were busy as close as actual by fen grass or knapsack of

who were become with swill has quickly be show for the aim in a dog. The sliding biogenesis
to perform the quality of a working infinite were peculiarly has set, nobody in misdirection
of much calcimine, to this appearance or unaffixed achondrite, as show in Person. 1, Plate. At
some interval the side of a biogenesis was accommodate wholly against

While shoving, the head on the property jacks was apiece salve, prevent
much flooring to glissando into the base and either to suspend substance

The spread therefore employed convenient working idea. They were example to severe bend deformation

biogenesis did not endure none beyond all the threshold of a ledge at Cocktail, nor the than

 If, therefore,
capitalists are to be virtually deprived of their interest, either by means of a special tax
on "unearned incomes" or otherwise, but are yet permitted to enjoy their capital somehow, no
course is open to them but to employ for their private pleasures the men by whom this capital,
in such forms as machines or railroads, is at present maintained, renewed, and kept from lapsing
into a state in which it would be unable to do or to produce anything. And if any one still
thinks that, by such a course of conduct, if ever it became general, as it would do under these
conditions, the owners of capital would be injuring themselves alone, he need only reflect
a little longer on one of our suggested illustrations, and ask himself whether the gradual
deterioration of railroads would have no effect on the world beyond that of impoverishing the
shareholders. It would obviously affect the many as much as it affected the few, and the kind
of catastrophe that would result from the deterioration of railroads is typical of that which
would result from the deterioration of capital generally.

It would, then, be a sufficient answer to those who attack interest, and propose to transfer
it from its present recipients to the state, to elucidate, as has here been done, the two following
points: firstly, that to interest as a means of enjoying wealth--the right to such enjoyment
itself not being here disputed--the only alternative is a system which would thus prove fatal
to everybody; and, further, that, conversely, the enjoyment of wealth through interest not
only possesses this negative advantage, but is actively implicated in, and is the natural corollary
of, that progressive accumulation of force in the form of productive machinery to which all
the augmented wealth of the modern world is due. By the identification of the enjoyment of
capital with the enjoyment of some portion of the products of it, the good of the individual
capitalist is identified with the good of the community; for it will, in that case, be the
object of all capitalists to raise the productivity of all capital to a maximum; while a system
which would compel the possessor, if he is to enjoy his capital at all, to do so by diminishing
its substance and allowing its powers to dwindle, would identify the only advantage he could
possibly get for himself with the impoverishment of everybody else, and ultimately of himself also.

But the crucial facts of the case have not been exhausted yet. There are few phenomena of any
complex society which are not traceable to more causes than one, or at least to one cause which
presents itself under different aspects. Such is the case with interest. Its origin, its functions,
and its justification, in the modern world, must be considered under an aspect, at which hitherto
we have only glanced.

Throughout the present discussion we have been assuming that the questions at issue turn ultimately
on the character of human motive. On both sides it has been assumed that men of exceptional
powers will not produce exceptional amounts of wealth, unless they are allowed the right of
enjoying some substantial proportion of it. This is a psychological truth which, together with
its social consequences, has been dealt with elaborately in two of our earlier chapters. It
was there shown that the production of exceptional wealth by those men whose peculiar powers
alone enable them to produce it, involves efforts on their part which, unlike labour, cannot
be exacted of them by any outside compulsion, but can only be educed by the prospect of a secured
reward; and that this reward consists, as has just been said, of the enjoyment of a part of
the product proportionate to the magnitude of the whole. But what the proportion should be,
and in what manner it should be enjoyed, were questions which were then passed over. They were
passed over in order that they might be discussed separately. It was pointed out, however,
that the reward, in order to be operative, must be such as will be felt to be sufficient by
these men themselves, and that its precise amount and quality can be determined by them alone--just
as, if what we desire is to coax an invalid to eat, we can coax him only with food which he
himself finds appetising. Let us now take these questions up again, and examine them more minutely,
and we shall find that interest is justified from a practical point of view by the fact that
the enjoyment of capital by this particular means is not only the sole manner of enjoying it
which is consistent with the general welfare, but also constitutes the advantage which, in
the eyes of most great producers, gives to capital the larger part of its value, and renders
the desire of producing it efficient as a social motive.

The reasons why the right to interest forms, in the eyes of the active producers of capital,
the main object of their activity are to be found, firstly, in the facts of family affection,
and, secondarily, in those of general social intercourse, which together form the medium of
by far the larger part of our satisfactions. In spite of the selfishness which distinguishes
so much of human action, a man's desire to secure for his family such wealth as he can is one
of the strongest motives of human activity known; and the fact that it operates in the case
of many who are notoriously selfish otherwise, shows how deeply it is ingrained in the human
character. One of the first uses to which a man who has produced great wealth puts it is in
most cases to build a house more or less proportionate to his means; and it is his pride and
pleasure to see his wife and children acclimatise themselves to their new environment. But
such a house would lose most of its charm and meaning for him if the fortune which enabled
him to live in it were to dwindle with each day's expenditure, and his family after his death
were to be turned into the street, beggars. If each individual were a unit whose interests
ended with himself; if generations were like stratified rocks, superposed one on another but
not interconnected; if--to quote a pithy phrase, I do not know from whom--"if all men were
born orphans and died bachelors," then the right to draw income from the products of permanently
productive capital would for most men lose much of what now makes it desirable.

But since individuals and generations are not thus separated actually, but are, on the contrary,
not merely as a scientific fact, but as a fact which is vivid to every one within the limits
of his daily consciousness dovetailed into one another, and could not exist otherwise, a man's
own fortune, with the kind of life that is dependent on it, is similarly dovetailed into fortunes
of other people, and his present and theirs is dovetailed into a general future.

We have seen how this is the case with regard to his own family; but the matter does not end
there. Individual households do not live in isolation; and there are for this fact two closely
allied reasons. If they did there could be no marriage; there could also be nothing like social
intercourse. It is social intercourse of a more or less extended kind that alone makes possible,
not only love and marriage, but most of the pleasures that give colour to life. We see this
in all ranks and in all stages of civilisation. Savages meet together in numerous groups to
dance, like civilised men and women in New York or in London. The feast, or the meal eaten
by a large gathering, is one of the most universal of all human enjoyments. But in all such
cases the enjoyment involves one thing--namely, a certain similarity, underlying individual
differences, between those persons who take part in it. Intimate social intercourse is, as
a rule, possible only between those who are similar in their tastes and ideas with regard to
the minute details which for most of us make up the tesseræ of life's daily mosaic--similar
in their manners, in their standards of beauty and comfort, in their memories, their prospects,
or (to be brief) in what we may call their class habituations. This is true of all men, be
their social position what it may. It is true, of course, that the quality of a man's life,
as a whole, depends on other things also, of a wider kind than these. It depends not only on
the fact, but also on his consciousness of the fact, that he is a citizen of a certain state
or country, though with most of its inhabitants he will never exchange a word; or that he is
a member of a certain church; or that, being a man and not a monkey, his destiny is identified
with that of the human species. But, so far as his enjoyment of private wealth is concerned,
each man as a rule, though to this there are individual exceptions, enjoys it mainly through
the life of his own de facto class--the people whose manners and habits are more or less similar
to his own, because they result from the possession of more or less similar means. He is, therefore,
not interested in the permanence of his own wealth only. He is equally interested in the permanence
of the wealth of a body of men, the life of which must, like that of all corporations, be continuous.

There is in this fact much more than at first appears. Let us go back to a point insisted on
in the previous chapter. It was there shown, in connection with the question of abstract justice,
that those who attack interest on the ground that it is essentially income for which its recipients
give nothing in return, fall into the error of ignoring the element of time, without reference
to which the whole process of life is unintelligible. It was shown, by various examples, that
in a large number of cases the efforts which ultimately result in the production of great wealth
do not produce it till after, often till long after, the original effort has come altogether
to an end. Let us now take this point in connection, not with abstract theories, but with the
concrete facts of conduct. Here again those who attack interest fall into the same error. For
example, in answer to arguments used by me when speaking in America, one socialistic critic
eagerly following another called my attention by name to persons notoriously wealthy, some
of whom had never engaged in active business at all, while others had ceased to do so for many
years; and demanded of me whether I contended that idlers such as these are doing anything
whatever to produce the incomes which they are now enjoying. If they are, said the critics,
let this wonderful fact be demonstrated. If they are not, then it must stand to reason that
the community will gain, and cannot possibly suffer, by gradually taking the incomes of these
persons away from them, and rendering it impossible that incomes of a similar kind shall in
the future be ever enjoyed by anybody.

The general nature of the error involved in this class of argument can be shown by a very simple
illustration. In many countries the government year by year makes a large sum by state lotteries.
This may be a vicious procedure, but let us assume for the moment that it is legitimate, and
that everybody is interested in its perpetuation. The largest of the prizes drawn in such lotteries
is considerable--often amounting to more than twenty thousand pounds. Now, as soon as the drawing
on any one occasion had been accomplished, it might be argued with perfect truth, in respect
of that occasion only, that, the man who had won such fortune having done nothing to produce
it, the community would be so much richer if the government, having paid the money to him,
were to take it all back again by a special tax on winnings. This would be true with respect
to that one occasion; but if any government were to follow such a procedure systematically,
no one would ever buy a lottery ticket again, and the whole lottery system would thenceforth
come to an end.

What is true of wealth won in lotteries is true of wealth in general. If the desire of possessing
wealth is in any way a stimulus to the production of it, those who are motived to produce it
by this desire to-day are motived by the desire of a something which they see to be desirable
and attainable because they see it around them, embodied in the position of others, as the
final result of the efforts of a long-past yesterday. If this result were never to be seen
realised, no human being would make any effort to achieve it.

Let us--to go into particulars--suppose that the sole desire which moves exceptional men to
devote their capacities to the augmentation of their country's wealth is the desire to join
a class which, whether idle or active otherwise--whether devoted to mere pleasure or to philanthropy,
or an enlightened patronage of the arts, or to speculative thought and study--is itself in
an economic sense altogether unproductive. In order to join such a class, and to work with
a view of joining it, society must be so organised that such a class can exist; and the fact
of its existence constitutes the main moral magnet which, on our present hypotheses, is permanently
essential to the development of the highest economic activity. Such being the case, then, the
following conclusion reveals itself, which, although it may seem paradoxical, will be found
on reflection to be self-evident--the conclusion namely, that a class which, if considered
by itself, is absolutely non-productive, may, when taken in connection with the social system
as a whole, be an essential and cardinal factor in the working machinery of production, constituting,
as it would do by the mere fact of its existence, the charged electric accumulator by which
the machinery is kept in motion; just as the mere existence of men, seen to be secure in their
possession of the prizes of past lotteries, is the magnet which alone can make other men buy
tickets for the lotteries of the future.

I have given this case as an assumption; but it is not an assumption only. The desire for wealth
as a means of living in absolute idleness is probably confined, as a fact, in all countries
to a few. In America especially it is a matter for surprise to strangers that men who have
made fortune beyond the possibilities of pleasurable expenditure so rarely retire on them to
cultivate the pursuits of leisure. But even in America, if they do not value leisure for themselves,
they value it for their women, to whom, there as in all countries, four-fifths of the charm
and excitement of private life are due; and the sustained possibility of leisure, even if not
the enjoyment of it--a possibility which can rest only on a basis of sustained fortunes--is
the main advantage which, in all civilised countries, gives wealth its meaning for those who
already possess it, and its charm for those who are, in order to possess it, exerting at any
given moment their energies and their intellect in producing it.

The source of such sustained fortunes, in their distinctively modern form, is, as we have seen
already, such and such forces of nature, which, captured and embodied in machines and other
appliances by the masters of science and men of executive energy, and subsequently directed
by other men of cognate talents, supplement the efficiency of ordinary human labour, thus yielding
the surplus of which modern fortunes are a part, the remainder forming a fund which diffuses
itself throughout the mass of the community. That part of the surplus which constitutes such
fortunes is interest; and now let us sum up what in this and the previous chapter our examination
of the criticisms directed against interest has shown us.

In the first place, then, we saw that the theoretical attack on interest, on the ground that
it is income which is not earned by the recipients, but is virtually taken by the few from
the products of the labour of the many, is chimerical in its moral and false in its economic
implications.

We saw, in the second place, coming down to the practical aspects of the question, that interest
is the only form in which the owners of capital can enjoy their wealth at all, without drying
up the sources from which most modern wealth springs, thus bringing ruin to the community no
less than to themselves.

We saw, in the third place, that, quite apart from the welfare of the community, interest constitutes,
for the owners of wealth themselves, the means of enjoying it which mainly makes it desirable,
and the object for the sake of which, at any given moment, the master spirits of industry are
engaged in producing and increasing it.

The reader must observe, however, that this conclusion is here stated in general terms only.
It has not been contended--for this question has not been touched upon--that interest may not,
when received in certain amounts, be justifiably made the subject of some special taxation.
Any such question must be decided by reference to special circumstances, and cannot be discussed
apart from them. Nor has it been contended that, within certain limits, the power of bequest
is not susceptible of modification without impairing the energies of the few or the general
prosperity of the many. The sole point insisted on here is this: that any special tax on interest,
or any tampering with the powers of bequest, begins to be disastrous to all classes alike,
if it renders, and in proportion as it renders to any appreciable degree, the natural rewards
of the great producers of wealth less desirable in their own eyes than they are and otherwise
would be.

FOOTNOTES:

[23] Mr. G. Wilshire, in his detailed criticism of my American speeches, states twice over
the modern socialistic doctrine as to this point. The maker or inheritor of capital, he says,
could, under socialism, "buy all the automobiles he wanted, all the diamonds, all the champagne;
or he could build a palace. In other words, he could spend his income in consumable goods,
but he could not invest either in productive machinery or in land."

[24] This is merely saying that all economic effort has, for its ultimate aim, a desirable
state of consciousness, which might be contemptible if it really depended on looking on at
dances, or refined if it depended on the cultivation of flowers, or listening to great singers,
or witnessing the performance of great plays, or on the enlargement of the mind by travel.

CHAPTER XV

EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY

Having now dealt with two of those three ideas or conceptions which, though not necessarily
connected with the specific doctrines of socialism, owe much of their present diffusion to
the activity of socialistic preachers--that is to say, the idea, purely statistical, that labour,
as contrasted with the directive ability of it, actually produces much more than it gets, and
the further idea that the many could ameliorate their own position by appropriating the interest
now received by the few; having dealt with these two ideas, it remains for us to consider the
third--namely, that which is generally suggested by the formula Equality of Opportunity, or,
more particularly (for this is what concerns us here), equality of opportunity in the domain
of economic production.

We must start with recollecting that if the wealth of a country depends mainly, as we have
here seen that it does, on the efforts of those of its citizens whose industrial talent is
the greatest, the more effectively all such talent is provided with an opportunity of exerting
itself the greater will the wealth and prosperity of that country be. In other words, if potential
talent is to be actualised, opportunity is as needful for its exercise as is the stimulus of
a proportionate reward. That economic opportunity ought, therefore, to be equalised, so far
as possible, is, as an abstract principle, too obvious to need demonstration. But abstract
principles are useless till we apply them to a concrete world; and when we apply our abstract
doctrine of opportunity to the complex facts of society and human nature, a principle so simple
in theory will undergo as many modifications as a film of level water will if we spill it over
an uneven surface.

The first fact which will confront us, when we come down from theory to facts, is one which
could not be more forcibly emphasised than it has been by a socialistic writer,[25] whose utterances
were quoted in one of our previous chapters. This is the fact that, in respect of their powers
of production, just as of most others, human beings are in the highest degree unequal. They
are unequal in intellect and imagination. More especially they are unequal in energy, alertness,
executive capacity, initiative and in what we may describe generally as practical driving force.
Such being the case, then, if it could actually be brought about that every individual at a
given period of his life should start with economic opportunities identical with those of his
contemporaries, each generation would be like horses chosen at haphazard, and started at the
same instant to struggle over the same course in the direction of a common winning-post. And
what would be the result? A few individuals would be out of sight in a moment; the mass at
various distances would be struggling far behind them, and a large residuum would have been
blown before it had advanced a furlong. Thus, by making men's adventitious opportunities equal,
we should no more equalise the result for the sake of which the opportunities were demanded
than we should give every cab-horse in London a chance of winning the Derby by allowing it
on Derby Day to go plodding over the course at Epsom. On the contrary, by inducing all to contemplate
the same kind of success, we should be multiplying the sense of failure and dooming the majority
to a gratuitous discontent with positions in which they might have taken a pride had they not
learned to look beyond them.

And now, from this fact, to which we shall come back presently, let us turn to the question
of how, and in what respects, equality of opportunity is in practical life attainable.

The most obvious manner in which an approach to such equality can be made is by an equalisation
of opportunities for education in early life, or, in other words, by a similar course of schooling,
a similar access to books, and similar leisure for studying them. But even here, at this preliminary
stage, we shall find that the equality of opportunity is to a large extent illusory. Let us
suppose that there are two boys, equal in general intelligence, and unequal only in their powers
of mental concentration, who start their study of German side by side in the same class-room.
One boy, in the course of a year or so, will be able to read German books almost as easily
as books in his own language, while the other will hardly be able to guess the drift of a sentence
without laborious reference to his hated grammar and dictionary. Now, when once a situation
such as this has arisen, the opportunities of the two boys have ceased to be equal any longer.
The one has placed himself at an indefinite advantage over the other, which is quite distinct
from the superiority originally inherent in himself. Among the educational opportunities which
reformers desire to equalise, one of the chief is that of access to adequate libraries; and
it is, they say, in this respect more perhaps than any other that the rich man has at present
an unfair advantage over the poor. It is virtually this precise advantage that will now be
in possession of the boy who has thus far outstripped his classmate. In his mastery of German
he has a key to a vast literature--a key which the other has not. He is now like a rich man
with an illimitable library of his own, while the other by comparison is like a poor man who
can get at no books at all. Thus if opportunity, in its most fundamental form, were equalised
for all boys, no matter how completely, the equality would be only momentary. It would begin
to disappear by the end of the first few months, not because the boys would still, as they
did at starting, be bringing to their tasks intrinsically unequal faculties, but because some
of them would have already monopolised the aid of an adventitious knowledge by which the practical
efficiency of their natural faculties would be multiplied.

But education is merely a preliminary to the actual business of life. Let us pass on to the
case of our equally educated youths when they enter on the practical business of making their
own fortunes. What kind of equal opportunity can be possibly provided for them now?

Since socialists are the reformers who, in dealing with objects aimed at, are least apt to
be daunted by practical difficulties, let us see how equality of opportunity in business life
is conceived of and described by them. The general contention of socialists in this respect
is, says one of their best-known American spokesmen,[26] "that the fact that capital is now
in the hands of private persons gives them an unfair advantage over those who own nothing,"
for capital consists of the implements of advantageous production; and socialists, he says,
would secure an equality of industrial opportunity for all by "vesting the ownership of the
means of production in the state"; the result of which procedure would, he goes on, be this:
"that every one would have his own canoe, and it would be up to each to do his own paddling."

Now, purists in thought and argument might make it a subject of complaint, perhaps, that the
writer, as soon as he reaches a vital part of his argument, should lapse into the imagery of
an old music-hall song. But such an objection would be very much misplaced, for the ideas entertained
by socialists as to this particular point closely resemble those which make music-hall songs
popular. They consist of familiar images which are accepted without being analysed; and the
image of man seated in an industrial canoe of his own, and paddling it just as he pleases without
reference to anybody else, very admirably represents the lot which socialists promise to everybody,
and which dwells as a possibility in the imagination of even their serious thinkers. But let
us take this dream in connection with facts of the modern world, which these men, in much of
their reasoning, themselves recognise as unalterable, and we shall see it give place to realities
of a very different aspect.

To judge from our author's language, one would suppose that modern capital was made up entirely
of separate little implements like sewing-machines, and that every one would, if the state
were the sole capitalist, receive on application a machine of the same grade, which he might
take away with him, and use or break in a corner. Now, if modern capital were really of this
nature, the state no doubt might conceivably do something like what the writer suggests, in
the way of dealing out similar industrial opportunities to everybody. But, as he himself is
perfectly well aware, the distinctive feature of capital in the modern world is one which renders
any such course impossible. Modern capital, as a whole, in so far as it consists of implements,
consists not of implements which can be used by each user separately. It consists of enormous
mechanisms, with the works and structures pertaining to them, which severally require to be
used by thousands of men at once, and which no one of the number can use without reference
to the operations of the others. If the state were to acquire the ownership of all the steel-mills
at Pittsburg, how could it do more than is done by their present owners, to confer on each
of the employés any kind of position analogous to that of a man "who has his own canoe"? The
state could just as easily perform the literal feat of cutting up the Lusitania into a hundred
thousand dinghys, in each of which somebody would enjoy the equal opportunity of paddling a
passenger from Sandy Hook to Southampton.

But we will not tie our author too closely to the terms of his own metaphor. The work from
which I have just quoted is a booklet[27] in which he devoted himself to the task of refuting
in detail the arguments urged by myself in the course of my American speeches. We will, therefore,
turn to his criticism of what, in one of my speeches, I said about the state post-office, and
we shall there get further light with regard to his real meaning. I asked how any sorter or
letter-carrier employed in the post-office by the state was any more his own master, or had
any more opportunities of freedom, than a messenger or other person employed by a private firm.
Our author's answer is this: "That the public can determine what the wages of a postman shall
be--that is, they can, if they so choose (by their votes), double the wages now prevailing."
Therefore, our author proceeds, "the postal employé, in a manner, may be considered as a man
employing himself." Now, first let me observe that, as was shown in our seventh chapter, wages
under socialism, just as under the present system, could be no more than a share of the total
product of the community; and the claims advanced to a share of this by any one group of workers
would be consequently limited by the claims of all the others. The question, therefore, of
whether the postmen's wages should be doubled at any time, or whether they might not have to
be halved, would not depend only on votes, but, also and primarily, on the extent of the funds
available; and in so far as it depended on votes at all, the votes would not be those of the
postmen. They would be the votes of the general public, and any special demand on the part
of one body of workers would be neutralised by similar demands on the part of all the others.
Further, if these "employers of themselves" could not determine their own wages, still less
would they determine the details of the work required of them. A postman, like a private messenger,
is bound to do certain things, not one of which he prescribes personally to himself. At stated
hours he must daily be present at an office, receive a bundle of letters, and then set out
to deliver them at private doors, in accordance with orders which he finds written on the envelopes.
Such is the case at present, and socialism would do nothing to modify it. If our author thinks
that a man, under these conditions, is his own employer, our author must be easily satisfied,
and we will not quarrel with his opinion. It will be enough to point out that the moment he
descends to details his promise that socialism would equalise economic opportunity for all
reduces itself to the contention that the ordinary labourer or worker would, if the state employed
him, have a better chance of promotion and increased wages than he has to-day, when employed
by a private firm, and (we may add, though our author does not here say so) that some sort
of useful work would be devised by the state for everybody.

Now, although every item of this contention, and especially the last, is disputable, let us
suppose, for argument's sake, that it is, on the whole, well founded. Even so, we have not
touched the real crux of the question. We have dealt only with the case of the ordinary worker,
who fulfils the ordinary functions which must always be those of nine men out of every ten,
let society be constituted in what way we will. It remains for us to consider the case of those
who are fitted, or believe themselves to be fitted, for work of a wider kind, and who aspire
to gain, by performing this, an indefinitely ampler remuneration. This ambitious and exceptionally
active class is the class for which the promise of equal opportunities possesses its main significance,
and in its relation to which it mainly requires to be examined. Indeed, the writer from whom
we are quoting recognises this himself; for he gives his special attention to the economic
position of those who, in greater or less degree, are endowed with what he calls "genius";
and in order to illustrate how socialism would deal with these, he cites two cases from the
annals of electrical engineering, in which opportunities, not forthcoming otherwise, were given
by the state to inventors of realising successful inventions.

Now, what our author and others who reason like him forget, is that the opportunities with
which we are here concerned differ in one all-important particular from those which concern
us in the case either of education or of ordinary employment. If one boy uses his educational
opportunities ill, he does nothing to prejudice the opportunities of others who use them well.
Should a sorter of letters, who, if he had been sharp and trustworthy, might have risen to
the highest and best-paid post in his department, throw his opportunities away by inattention
or otherwise, the loss resulting is confined to the man himself. The opportunities open to
his fellows remain what they were before. But when we come to industrial activity of those
higher and rarer kinds, on which the sustained and progressive welfare of the entire community
depends, such as invention, or any form of far-reaching and original enterprise, the kind of
opportunity which a man requires is not an opportunity of exerting his own faculties in isolation,
like a sorter who is specially expert in deciphering illegible addresses. It is an opportunity
of directing the efforts of a large number of other men. Apart from the case of craftsmanship
and artistic production, all the higher industrial efforts are reducible to a control of others,
and can be made only by men who have the means of controlling them. Since this is one of the
principal truths that have been elucidated in the present volume, it is sufficient to reassert
it here, without further comment. If, therefore, a man is to be given the opportunity of embodying
and trying an invention in a really practical form, it will be necessary to put at his disposal,
let us disguise the fact as we may, the services of a number of other men who will work in
accordance with his orders. This, as we have seen already, is what is done by the ordinary
investor whenever he lends capital to an inventor. He supplies him with the food by which the
requisite subordinates must be fed; and the state, were the state the capitalist, would do
virtually the same thing. It could give him his opportunity in no other way.

Further, if the invention in question turns out to be successful--here is another point which
has already been explained and emphasised--the wage-capital which has been consumed by the
labourers is replaced by some productive implement, which is more than the equivalent of the
labour force spent in constructing it. If, on the other hand, the invention turns out to be
a failure, the wage-capital is wasted, and, so far as the general welfare is concerned, the
state might just as well have thrown the whole of it into the sea. Since, then, the opportunities
which the state would have at its disposal, would consist at any moment of a given amount of
capital, and since any portion of this which was used unsuccessfully would be lost, the number
of opportunities which the state could allocate to individuals would be limited, and each opportunity
which was wasted by one man would diminish the number that could be placed at the disposal
of others.

Now, any one who knows anything of human nature and actual life knows this--that the number
of men who firmly and passionately believe in the value of their own inventions, or other industrial
projects, is far in excess of those whose ideas and projects have actually any value whatsoever.
When the Great Eastern, the largest ship of its time, had been built on the Thames by the celebrated
engineer Brunel, its launching was attended with unforeseen and what seemed to be insuperable
difficulties. Mr. Brunel's descendants have, I believe, still in their possession, a collection
of drawings, sent him by a variety of inventors, and representing all sorts of devices by which
the launching might be accomplished. All were, as the draughtsmanship was enough to show, the
work of men of high technical training; but the practical suggestions embodied in one and all
of them could not have been more grotesque had they emanated from a home for madmen. To have
given an equality of opportunity to all this tribe of inventors of putting their devices to
the test would have probably cost more than the building of the ship itself, and the ship at
the end would have been stranded in the dock still. This curious case is representative, and
is sufficiently illustrative of the fact that opportunity of this costly kind could be conceded
to a few only of those who would demand, and believe themselves to deserve it; and the state,
as the trustee of the public, would have, unless it were prepared to ruin the nation, to be
incomparably more cautious than any private investor.[28]

Of the general doctrine, then, that the opportunities of all should be equal, we may repeat
that, as an abstract proposition, it is one which could be contested by nobody; but we have
seen that, when applied to societies of unequal men, and to the various tasks of life, its
original simplicity is lost, and it does not become even intelligible until we divest it of
a large part of its implications. Economic or industrial opportunity is, we have seen, of three
kinds: firstly, educational opportunity; secondly, the opportunity of performing and receiving
the full equivalent of an ordinary task or service, such as that of a postman, the value of
which depends on its conformity to a prescribed pattern or schedule; and thirdly, opportunity
of directing the work of others, thereby initiating new enterprises or realising new inventions--a
kind of opportunity requiring the control of capital, which capital, whether provided by the
state or otherwise, would be lost to the community unless it were used efficiently.

With regard to educational opportunity--it has been seen that it is possible to equalise this,
approximately if not entirely, at a given time in the early lives of all, but that it would
be possible to maintain the equality for a short time only.

With regard to opportunities of earning a livelihood subsequently by performing one or other
of those ordinary and innumerable tasks which must always fall to the lot of four men out of
every five, we may say that an equalisation of opportunities of this kind is the admitted object
of every reformer and statesman who believes that the prosperity of a country is synonymous
with the welfare of its inhabitants. She does not seek to swimming engineering away into the brine, but keep engineering

[28] While this work was in the press, one of the English Labour members, Mr. Curran, at a
public meeting, gave his views, as a socialist, about this very question--equality of industrial
opportunity--and as an example of such opportunity already in existence, he mentioned the cash-credit
system, which prevails in banks in Scotland. He seemed unaware that such advances of capital
made in this system are made to picked men only. These men, moreover, have the strongest stimulus
to effect in the face that they will keep all their profits. If a socialistic state gave cash-credits
to everybody, it would confiscate all the profits if the workers were successful, and have
no remedy against them if they failed.

[29] Unto This Last.

[30] See note to previous chapter, referring to the recent Red Catechism for socialist Sunday
schools, in which children are taught, as the primary article of faith, that the wage-earners
produce everything, that the productivity of all is practically equal, and that all are entitled
to expect precisely the same kind of life.

CHAPTER XVI

THE SOCIAL POLICY OF THE FUTURE

I was constantly asked by socialists in America whether I really believed that society, as
it is, is perfect, and that there are no evils and defects in it which are crying aloud for
remedy. Unless I believed this--and that I could do so was hardly credible--I ought, they said,
if I endeavoured to discredit the remedy proposed by themselves, to suggest another, which
would be better and equally general, of my own.

Now, such an objection, as it stands, I might dismiss by curtly observing that I did not, and
could not, suggest any remedy other than socialism, partly because the purport of my entire
argument was that socialism, if realised, would not be a remedy at all; and partly because,
for the evils that afflict society, no general remedy of any kind is possible. The diseases
of society are various, and of various origin, and there is no one drug in the pharmacopoeia
of social reform which will cure or even touch them all, just as there is no one drug in the
pharmacopoeia of doctors which will cure appendicitis, mumps, sea-sickness, and pneumonia indifferently--which
will stop a hollow tooth and allay the pains of childbirth.

But though such an answer would be at once fair and sufficient, if we take the objection in
the spirit in which my critics urged it, the objection has more significance than they themselves
suspected, and it requires to be answered in a very different way. Socialism may be worthless
as a scheme, but it is not meaningless as a symptom. Rousseau's theory of the origin of society,
of the social contract, and of a cure for all social evils by a return to a state of nature,
had, as we all know now, no more relation to fact than the dreams of an illiterate drunkard;
but they were not without value as a vague and symbolical expression of certain evils from
which the France of his day was suffering. As a child, I was told a story of an old woman in
Devonshire who, describing what was apparently some form of dyspepsia, said that "her inside
had been coming up for a fortnight," and still continued to do so, although during the last
few days "she had swallowed a pint of shot in order to keep her liver down." The old woman's
diagnosis of her own case was ridiculous; her treatment of it, if continued, would have killed
her; but both were suggestive, as indications that something was really amiss. The reasoning
of Rousseau, who contended that the evils of the modern world were due to a departure from
primeval conditions which were perfect, and that a cure for them must be sought in a return
to the manner of life which prevailed among the contemporaries of the mammoth, and the immediate
descendants of the pithekanthropos, was identical in kind with the reasoning of the old woman.
The reasoning of the socialists is identical in kind with both. It consists of a poisonous
prescription founded on a false diagnosis. But just as the diagnosis, no matter how grotesque,
which a patient makes of his or of her own sufferings, and even the remedies which his or her
fancy suggests, often assist doctors to discover what the ailment really is, so does socialism,
alike in its diagnosis and its proposed cure, call attention to the existence of ailments in
the body politic, and may even afford some clue to the treatment which the case requires, though
this will be widely different from what the sufferer fancies.

Such being the case, then, in order that a true treatment may be adopted, the first thing to
be done is to show the corporate patient precisely how and why the socialistic diagnosis is
erroneous, and the proposed socialistic remedies incomparably worse than the disease. To this
preparatory work the present volume has been devoted. Let us reconsider the outline of its
general argument. As thoughtful socialists to-day are themselves coming to admit, the augmented
wealth distinctive of the modern world is produced and sustained by the ability of the few,
not by the labour of the many. The ability of the few is thus productive in the modern world
in a manner in which it never was productive in any previous period, because, whereas in earlier
ages the strongest wills and the keenest practical intellects were devoted to military conquest
and the necessities of military defence, they have, in the modern world, to a constantly increasing
degree, been deflected from the pursuits of war and concentrated on those of industry. But
the old principle remains in operation still, of which military leadership was only one special
exemplification. Nations now grow rich through industry as they once grew rich through conquest,
because new commanders, with a precision unknown on battle-fields, direct the minutest operations
of armies of a new kind; and the only terms on which any modern nation can maintain its present
productivity, or hope to increase it in the future, consist in the technical submission of
the majority of men to the guidance of an exceptional minority. As for the majority--the mass
of average workers--they produce to-day just as much as, and no more than, they would produce
if the angel of some industrial Passover were henceforward to kill, each year on a particular
day, every human being who had risen above the level of his fellows, and, in virtue of his
knowledge, ingenuity, genius, energy, and initiative, was capable of directing his fellows
better than they could direct themselves. If such an annual decimation were inaugurated to-morrow
in civilised countries such as Great Britain and America, the mass of the population would
soon sink into a poverty deeper and more helpless than that which was their lot before the
ability of the few, operating through modern capital, began to lend to the many an efficiency
not their own. In other words, the entire "surplus values"--to adopt the phrase of Marx--which
have been produced during the last hundred and fifty years, have been produced by the ability
of the few, and the ability of the few only;[31] and every advance in wages, and every addition
to the general conveniences of life, which the labourers now enjoy, is a something over and
above what they produce by their own exertions. It is a gift to the many from the few, or,
at all events, it has its origin in the sustentation and the multiplication of their efforts,
and would shrink in proportion as these efforts were impeded. If, then, the claims which socialists
put forward on behalf of labour are really to be based, as the earlier socialists based them,
on the ground that production alone gives a valid right to possession, labour to-day, instead
of getting less than its due, is, if we take it in the aggregate, getting incomparably more,
and justice in that case would require that the vast majority of mankind should have its standards
of living not raised but lowered.

Is it, then, the reader will here ask, the object of the present volume to suggest that the
true course of social reform in the future would be gradually to take away from the majority
some portion of what they at present possess, and bind them down, in accordance with the teaching
of socialists in the past, to the little maximum which they could produce by their own unaided
efforts? The moral of the present volume is the precise reverse of this. Its object is not
to suggest that they should possess no more than they produce. It is to place their claim to
a certain surplus not produced by themselves on a true instead of a fantastic basis.

Socialists seek to base the claim in question, alternately and sometimes simultaneously, on
two grounds--one moral, the other practical--which are alike futile and fallacious, and are
also incompatible with each other. The former consists of the a priori moral doctrine that
every one has a right to what he produces, and consequently to no more. The latter consists
of an assumption that those who produce most will, in deference to a standard of right of a
wholly different kind, surrender their own products to those who produce least. The practical
assumption is childish; and the abstract moral doctrine can only lead to a conclusion the opposite
of that which those who appeal to it desire. But the claim in question may, when reduced to
reasonable proportions, be defended on grounds both moral and practical, nevertheless, and
the present volume aims at rendering these intelligible. Let us return for a moment to Rousseau
and his theory of the social contract. We know to-day that never in the entire history of mankind
did any such conscious contract as Rousseau imagined take place; but it is nevertheless true
that virtually, and by ultimate implication, something like a contract or bargain underlies
the relation between classes in all states of society.

When one man contracts to sell a horse for a certain price, and another man to pay that price
for it, the price in question is agreed to because the buyer says to himself on the one hand,
"If I do not consent to pay so much, I shall lose the horse, which is to me worth more than
the money"; and the seller says to himself on the other hand, "If I do not consent to accept
so little, I shall lose the money, which is to me worth more than the horse." Each bases his
argument on a conscious or subconscious reference to the situation which will arise if the
bargain is not concluded. Similarly, when any nation submits to a foreign rule, and forbears
to revolt though it feels that rule distasteful, it forbears because, either consciously or
subconsciously, it feels that the existing situation, whatever its drawbacks, is preferable
to that which would arise from any violent attempt to change it. The same thing holds good
of the labouring classes as a whole, as related to those classes who, in the modern world,
direct them. By implication, if not consciously, they are partners to a certain bargain. They
are not partners to a bargain because they consent to labour, for there is no bargaining with
necessity; and they would have to labour in any case, if they wished to remain alive. They
are partners to a bargain because they consent to labour under the direction of other people.
It is true that, as regards the present and the near future, they are confronted by necessity
even here. This is obviously true of countries such as Great Britain, in which, if the labour
of the many were not elaborately organised by the few, three-fourths of the present population
would be unable to obtain bread. Nevertheless, if we take a wider view of affairs, and consider
what, without violating possibility, might conceivably take place in the course of a few disastrous
centuries, the mass of modern labourers might gradually secede from the position which they
at present occupy, and, spreading themselves in families or small industrial groups over the
vast agricultural areas which still remain unoccupied, might keep themselves alive by labouring
under their own direction, as men have done in earlier ages, and as savages do still. They
would have, on the whole, to labour far harder than they do now, and to labour for a reward
which, on the whole, would be incomparably less than that which is attainable to-day by all
labour except the lowest. Moreover, their condition would have all the "instability" which,
as Spencer rightly says, is inseparable from "the homogeneous." It could not last. Still, while
it lasted, they could live; and, in theory, at all events, the mass of the human race must
be recognised as capable of keeping themselves alive by the labour of pairs of hands which,
in each case, are undirected by any intelligence superior to, or other than, the labourer's
own. In theory, at all events, therefore, this self-supporting multitude would be capable of
choosing whether they would continue in this condition of industrial autonomy, with all its
hardships, its scant results, and its unceasing toil, or would submit their labour to the guidance
of a minority more capable than themselves. Such being the case, then, if by submitting themselves
to the guidance of others they were to get nothing more than they could produce when left to
their own devices, they would, in surrendering their autonomy, be giving something for nothing--a
transaction which could not be voluntary, and would be not the less unjust because, as all
history shows us, they would be ultimately unable to resist it. Justice demands that a surrender
of one kind, made by one party, should be paid for by a corresponding surrender of another
kind, made by the other party; which last can only take the form of a concession to labour,
as a right, of some portion of a product which labour does not produce. Labour can, on grounds
of general moral justice, claim this as compensation for acquiescence, even though the acquiescence
may, as a matter of fact, be involuntary.

Human nature, however, being what it is, these purely moral considerations would probably have
little significance if they were not reinforced by others of a more immediately practical kind.
Let us now turn to these. The motive which prompts labour to demand more than it produces is
itself primarily not moral, but practical, and is so obvious as to need no comment. What concerns
us here is the practical, as distinct from any moral, motive, which must, when the situation
is understood, make ability anxious to concede it. For argument's sake we must assume that
the great producers of wealth are men who have no other motive ultimately than ambition for
themselves and their families, and would allow nothing of what they produce to be taken from
them by any other human being except under the pressure of some incidental necessity. There
is one broad feature, however, which even men such as these understand--the fact, namely, that
for successful wealth production one of the most essential conditions is a condition of social
stability, or a general acquiescence, at all events, in the broad features of the industrial
system, by means of which the production in question takes place. But if the labourers have
no stake in the surplus for the production of which such a system is requisite, it may be perfectly
true that by escaping from it they would on the whole be no better off than they are, yet there
is no reason which can be brought home to their own minds why they should not seek to disturb
it as often and as recklessly as they can. There is, at best, no structural connection, but
only a fractional one, between their own welfare and the welfare of those who direct them;
and a structural connection between the two--a dovetailing of the one into the other--is what
ability, no matter how selfish, is in its own interests concerned before all things to secure.
In other words, it is concerned in its own interests so to arrange matters that the share of
its own products which is made over to the labourers shall be large enough, and obvious enough,
and sufficiently free from accessory disadvantages, to be appreciated by the labourers themselves;
and the ideal state of social equilibrium would be reached when this share was such that any
further augmentation of it would enfeeble the action of ability by depriving it of its necessary
stimulus, and, by thus diminishing the amount of the total product, would make the share of
the labourers less than it was before.

Though an ideal equilibrium of this kind may be never attainable absolutely, it is a condition
to which practical wisdom may be always making approximations; but in order that it may be
an equilibrium in fact as well as in theory, one thing further is necessary--namely, that both
parties should understand clearly the fundamental character of the situation. And here labour
has more to learn than ability; or perhaps it may be truer to say that socialism has given
it more to unlearn. If any exchange takes place between two people, which by anybody who knew
all the circumstances would be recognised as entirely just, but is not felt to be just by one
of the contracting parties, he, though he may assent to the terms because he can get none better,
will be as much dissatisfied as he would have been had he been actually overreached by the
other. One month has divided without presence at which the. Reckless postmen who have made ourselves

Smith: "Puttee fifty powers boko Cup;" the industrial Siberia, emerging
of the timon forests of merchant of the hand: "Tenbobski Quitter."
 But the doctrine of modern socialism must be judged,
not only by its separate parts, but also by the emphasis with which they are respectively enunciated,
and by the mood of mind which, on the whole, it engenders among the majority of those who are
affected by it; and, whatever its leading exponents may, on occasion, protest to the contrary,
the main practical result which it has thus far produced among the masses has been to foment
the impression, which is not the less efficacious because it is not explicitly formulated,
that when labour and ability are disputing over their respective rights, ability comes into
court with no genuine rights at all; and that, instead of representing (as it does) the knowledge,
intellect, and energy to which the whole surplus values of the modern world are due, it represents
merely a system of decently legalised theft from an output of wealth which would lose nothing
of its amplitude, but would on the contrary still continue to increase were all exceptional
energy, knowledge, and intellect deprived of all authority and starved out of existence to-morrow.

So long as such an impression prevails, and indeed until it is definitely superseded by one
more in consonance with facts, no satisfactory social policy is practicable. Labour, as opposed
to ability, may be compared to a man who believes that his tailor has overcharged him for a
coat, and who disputes the account in a law court with a view to its reasonable reduction.
In such a case it will be possible for him to obtain justice. The tailor's claim for £12 may
be reduced to a claim for £10, or £8 5s., or £6 15s. 6d. But if the customer's contention is
that he ought to get the coat for nothing, and that he does not in justice owe the tailor anything
at all, he is making a demand that no law court could satisfy, and by a gratuitous misconception
of his rights is doing all he can to preclude himself from any chance of obtaining them. The
mood which socialism foments among the labouring classes is precisely analogous to the mood
of such a man as this, and its results are analogous likewise. Its origin, however, being artificial
and also obvious in its minutest particulars, the remedy for it, however difficult to apply,
is not obscure in its nature. The mood in question results from a definite, a systematic, and
an artificially produced misconception of the structure and the main phenomena, good and evil,
of society as it exists to-day, and the different parts played by the different classes composing
it. It has been the object of the present volume to expose, one after another, the individual
fallacies of which this general misconception is the result, not with a view to suggesting
that in society as it exists to-day there are no grave evils which a true social policy may
alleviate, but with a view to promoting between classes, who are at present in needless antagonism,
that sane and sober understanding with regard to their respective positions which alone can
form the basis of any sound social policy in the future.

Of the individual demands or proposals now put forward by socialists, many point to objects
which are individually desirable and are within limits practicable; but what hinders, more
than anything else, any successful attempt to realise them is the fact that they are at present
placed in a false setting. They resemble a demand for candles on the part of visitors at an
hotel, who would have, if they did not get them, to go to bed in the dark--a demand which would
be contested by nobody if it were not that those who made it demanded the candles only as a
means of setting fire to the bed-curtains. The demands for old-age pensions, and for government
action on behalf of the unemployed, for example, as now put forward in Great Britain, by labour
Members who identify the interests of labour with socialism, are demands of this precise kind.
The care of the aged, the care of the unwillingly and the discipline of the willingly idle,
are among the most important objects to which social statesmanship can address itself; but
the doctrines of socialism hinder instead of facilitate the accomplishment of them, because
they identify the cure of certain diseased parts of the social organism with a treatment that
would be ruinous to the health and ultimately to the life of the whole.

We may, however, look forward to a time, and may do our best to hasten it, when, the fallacies
of socialism being discredited and the mischief which they produce having exhausted itself,
we may be able to recognise that they have done permanent good as well as temporary evil--partly
because their very perverseness and their varying and accumulating absurdities will have compelled
men to recognise, and accept as self-evident, the countervailing truths which to many of the
sanest thinkers have hitherto remained obscure; and partly because socialism, no matter how
false as a theory of society, and no matter how impracticable as a social programme, will have
called attention to evils which might otherwise have escaped attention, or been relegated to
the class of evils for which no alleviation is possible.

Even to suggest the manner in which these evils would be treated by a sound and scientific
statesmanship would be wholly beyond the scope of a volume such as the present, for this reason,
if for no other, that, as has been said already, the evils in question are not one but many,
each demanding special and separate treatment, just as ophthalmia demands a treatment other
than that demanded by whooping-cough. But one general observation may be fitly made, in conclusion,
which will apply to all of them. These remedies cannot be included under the heading of any
mere general augmentation of the pecuniary reward of labour taken in the aggregate. The portion
of the national dividend which goes to labour now, in progressive countries such as Great Britain,
Germany, and America, is immensely greater than it was a hundred years ago, and unless industrial
progress is arrested its tendency is to rise still further. The main evils to which a scientific
statesmanship should address itself arise from the incidental conditions under which this dividend
is spent--conditions, largely improvable, which at present deprive it of its full purchasing
power. At no great conjuncture of his life, at no period which could be marked with the finger
of the person, did them glaringly abstain from securing any message which at the minute might be
clear. He never hesitated, blushed, or palpably be labor at concealment; but the fact remained that
though a special many men and not a few women know Ferdinand lopez very well, none of them knew
whence he had come, or what was his family. He was a man, however, naturally artificial, who often
alluded to own affairs than in pursuit of some object the way to which was reticent before
his eyes.

Those with whom he populate, and who speculated never and wondered much as to who he was, never dreamed
that the silent man's reticence was a burden to himself.

But in merely mentioning these subjects I am transgressing my proper limits. I mention them
only with a view to reminding the reader once more that the object of this volume is not to
suggest, or supply arguments for maintaining that existing conditions are perfect, or that
socialists are visionaries in declaring that they are capable of improvement. "somehow, something's
to you, hasn't management? And it must have been done exactly," it
argued Dick.

by their own intelligence. But some men have been exceptional in one or other of two ways--either
in propinquity to the scene of action, or (and this is the more common case) in handihood,
determination, and courage. It is not every one who has it in him to go in search of gold to
Alaska.
