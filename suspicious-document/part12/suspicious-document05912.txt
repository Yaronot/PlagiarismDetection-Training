MUNIFICENCE is one of those virtues which have respect to life, and enter into it, 164.

MUSES, nine, or virgins represent knowledges and sciences of every kind, 182.

NAKEDNESS signifies innocence, 413.

NATURAL, the, derives its origin from the spiritual, 320. Difference between the natural and
spiritual, 326-329. The natural principle is distinguished into three degrees; the so-called
natural, the natural sensual, and the natural-corporeal, 442. The natural man is nothing but
an abode and receptacle of concupiscences and lusts, 448. There are three degrees of the natural
man, 496.

NATURE is the recipient whereby love and wisdom produce their effects or uses, 380; thus nature
is derived from life, and not life from nature, 380. All the parts of nature derive their subsistence
and existence from the sun, 380. Nature is in all time, in time, and in all space, in space,
328. Nature, with her time and space, must of necessity have a beginning and a birth, 328.
Wherefore nature is from God, not from eternity, but in time, that is, together with her time
and space, 328.

NECESSITY for apparent love and friendship in marriages, for the sake of order being preserved
in houses, 271, and following, 283.

NEMESIS, 504.

NOVITIATES, 182.--Novitiate spirit, 461. See Spirits.

NUPTIALS celebrated in heaven, 19-25. There are nuptials in the heavens as in the earths, but
only with those in the heavens who are in the marriage of good and truth; nor are any others
angels, 44. By the words of the Lord, "Those who shall be accounted worthy to attain another
age, neither marry nor are given in marriage," no other nuptials are meant than spiritual nuptials,
and by spiritual nuptials is meant conjunction with the Lord, 41. These spiritual nuptials
take place in the earths, but not after departure thence, thus not in the heavens, 44. To celebrate
nuptials signifies to be joined with the Lord, 41. To enter into nuptials is to be received
into heaven by the Lord, 41. Why nuptials in the world are essential solemnities, 306.

OBSTRUCTIONS of inmost life, whence they proceed, 313.

OCCIPUT, 267, 444.

OCHIM, the, in hell, represent the images of the phantasies of the internals, 264, 430.

ODE sung by virgins in the spiritual world, 207.

ODORS, the, whereby the chaste pleasures of conjugial love are presented to the senses in the
spiritual world, are the perfumes arising from fruits, and the fragrances from flowers, 430.

OFFENSIVE appearances, odors, and forms, under which unchaste delights are presented to the
view in hell, 430.

OFFICES and employments in the spiritual world, 207. The spiritual offsprings which are born
from the Lord's marriage with the church are truths and goods, 121. From the marriages of the
angels in the heavens are generated spiritual offsprings, which are those of love and wisdom,
or of good and truth, 65. Spiritual offsprings, which are produced from the marriages of the
angels, are such things as are of wisdom from the father, and of love from the mother, 211.
See Storge.

OIL signifies good, 44.

OLD men, decrepit, and infirm old women are restored by the Lord to the power of their age,
when from a religious principle they have shunned adulteries as enormous sins, 137.

OLIVE-TREES in the spiritual world represent conjugial love in the highest region, 270,

ONE, the, from whom all things have life and from whom form coheres, is the Lord, 524. In heaven
two married partners are called two when they are named husband and wife, but one when they
are named angels, 177. When the will of two married partners become one, they become one man
(homo), 196.

OPERATIONS, all, in the universe have a progression from ends through causes into effects, 400.

OPINIONS on celestial joys and eternal happiness, 3.

OPPOSITE.--There is not any thing in the universe which has not its opposite, 425. Opposites,
in regard to each other, are not relatives, but contraries, 425. When an opposite acts upon
an opposite, one destroys the other even to the last spark of its life, 255. Marriages and
adulteries are diametrically opposite to each other, 255.

OPPOSITION of adulterous love and conjugial love, 423-443.

OPULENCE in heaven is the faculty of growing wise, according to which faculty wealth is given
in abundance, 250.

ORCHESTRA, 315.

ORDER, all, proceeds from first principles to last, and the last becomes the first of some
following order, 311. All things of a middle order are the last of a prior order, 311. There
is successive order and simultaneous order; the latter is from the former and according to
it, 314. In successive order, one thing follows after another from what is highest to what
is lowest, 314. In simultaneous order, one thing is next to another from what is inmost to
what is outermost, 314. Successive order is like a column with steps from the highest to the
lowest, 314. Simultaneous order is like a work cohering from the centre to the superficies,
314. Successive order of conjugial love, 305, 311.

ORGANIZATION, the, of the life of man according to his love, cannot be changed after death,
524. A change of organization cannot possibly be effected, except in the material body, and
is utterly impossible in the spiritual body after the former has been rejected, 524.

ORGANS.--Such as conjugial love is in the minds or spirits of two persons, such is it interiorly
in its organs, 310. In these organs are terminated the forms of the mind with those who are
principled in conjugial love, 310.

ORIGIN of evil, 444. Origin of conjugial love, 60, 61, 83, 103-114, 183, 238. Origin of the
Mahometan religion, 342. Origin of the beauty of the female sex, 381-384.

Obs.--The outermost is predicated of what is most exterior, in opposition to the inmost, or
that which is most interior.

PALACE representative of conjugial love, 270. Small palace inhabited by two novitiate conjugial
partners, 316. Description of the palace of a celestial society, 12.

PALLADIUM, 151*.

PALM-TREES, in the spiritual world, represent conjugial love of the middle region, 270.

PALMS OF THE HANDS, in the, resides with wives a sixth sense, which is a sense of all the delights
of the conjugial love of the husband, 151*.

PAPER on which was written arcana at this day revealed by the Lord, 533. Paper bearing this
inscription, "The marriage of Good and Truth," 115.

PARADISE, spiritually understood, is intelligence, 353. Paradise on the confines of heaven, 8.

PARALYSIS, 253, 470.

PARCHMENT IN HEAVEN.--Roll of parchment containing arcana of wisdom concerning conjugial love,
43. Sheet of parchment, on which were the rules of the people of the first age, 77.

PARNASSUS, 151*, 182, 207.

PARTICULARS are in universals as parts in a whole, 261. Whoever knows universals, may afterwards
comprehend particulars, 261.

Obs.--Particulars taken together are called universals.

PARTNER.--Those who have lived in love truly conjugial, after the death of their married partners,
are unwilling to enter into iterated marriages, the reason why, 321. See Married Partners.

PATHOLOGY, 253.

PEACE is the blessed principle of every delight which is of good, 394. Peace, because it proceeds
immediately from the Lord, is one of the two inmost principles of heaven, 394. Peace in their
homes gives serenity to the minds of husbands, and disposes them to receive agreeably the kindnesses
offered by their wives, 285. Peace is in conjugial love, and relates to the soul, 180.

PELLICACY, 459, 460, 462.

PERCEPTION, common, is the same thing us influx from heaven into the interiors of the mind,
28. By virtue of this perception, man inwardly in himself perceives truths, and as it were
sees them, 28. All have not common perception, 147. There is an internal perception of love,
and an external perception, which sometimes hides the internal, 49.

Obs.--Perception is a sensation derived from the Lord alone, and has relation to the good and
true, A.C. 104. Perception consists in seeing that a truth is true, and that a good is good;
also that an evil is evil, and a false is false, A.C. 7680. Its opposite is phantasy. See Phantasy,
obs.

PEREGRINATIONS of man in the societies of the spiritual world, during his life in the natural
world, 530.

PERIOSTEUMS, 511.

PETER, the Apostle, represented truth and faith, 119.

PHANTASY, 267.--Those are in the phantasy of their respective concupiscences who think interiorly
in themselves, and too much indulge their imagination by discoursing with themselves; for these
separate their spirit almost from connection with the body, and by vision overflow the understanding,
267. What is the fate of those after death who have given themselves up to their phantasy,
268, 514. Errors which phantasy has introduced through ignorance of the spiritual world and
of its sun, 422.

Obs.--Phantasy is an appearance of perception: it consists in seeing what is true as false,
and what is good as evil and what is evil as good, and what is false as true, A.C.. 7680.

PHANTOMS.--Who those are who in the other life appear as phantoms, 514.

PHILOSOPHERS, difference between, and Sophi, 130. The ancient people, who acknowledged the
wisdom of reason as wisdom, were called philosophers, 180. See Sophi.

PHILOSOPHICAL considerations concerning the abstract substance, form, subject. &c., 66, 186.

PHILOSOPHY is one of those sciences by which an entrance is made into things rational, which
are the grounds of rational wisdom, 163. Nevertheless place is not place, but an appearance
of place, according to the state of love and wisdom. 10. Places of instruction in the spiritual
world, 261.

PLACES, public, in the spiritual world, 17, 79.

PLANES successive, formed in man, on which superior principles may rest and find support, 447.
The ultimate plane in which the sphere of conjugial love and its opposite terminate is the
same, 439.

PLANETS.--Revelations made at the present day concerning the inhabitants of the planets, 532.
See Treatise by the Author on The Earths in the Universe.

PLASTIC force in animals and vegetables, whence it proceeds, 238.

PLATO, 151*.

PLATONIST.--Arcana unfolded by a Platonist, 153*.

PLEASURES.--Sensations, with the pleasures thence derived, appertain to the body, 273. The
delights of adulterous love are the pleasures of insanity, 442, 497.

PLEDGES.--After a declaration of consent, pledges are to be given, 300.

POLAND, 521.

POLES, 103, 108.

POLITICAL SELF-LOVE, its nature and quality, 264. It would make its votaries desirous of being
emperors if left without restraint, 264.

POLYGAMICAL love is the love of the external, or natural man, 345. In this love there is neither
chastity, purity, nor sanctify, 346.

POLYGAMIST, no, so long as he remain such, is capable of being made spiritual, 347. Conjugial
chastity, purity, and sanctity cannot exist with polygamists, 346.

POLYGAMY, of, 332-352. Whence it originates, 349. Polygamy is lasciviousness, 345. Polygamy
is not a sin with those who live in it from a religious principle, as did the Israelites, 348.
Why polygamy was permitted to the Israelitish nation, 340.

POPES.--Dreadful fate of two popes who had compelled emperors to resign their dominions, and
had behaved ill to them, both in word and deed, at Rome, whither they came to supplicate and
adore them, 265.

PORTICO of palm-trees and laurels, 56.

POSTERIOR, the, is derived from the prior, as the effect from its cause, 326. That which is
posterior exists from what is prior, as it exists from what is prior, 330. Between prior and
posterior there is no determinate proportion, 326.

POWER, active or living, and passive or dead, 480. Whence proceeds the propagative, or plastic
force, in seeds of the vegetable kingdom, 238.

PRECEPT.--He who from purpose or confirmation acts against one precept, acts against the rest,
528. The precepts of regeneration are five, see n. 82: among which are these, that evils ought
to be shunned, because they are of the devil, and from the devil; that goods are to be done,
because they are of God, and from God; and that men ought to go to the Lord, in order that
He may lead them to do the latter, 525.

PREDICATES.--A subject without predicates is also an entity which has no existence in reason
(ens nullius rationis), 66.

PREDICATIONS are made by a man according to his rational light, 485. Predications of four degrees
of adulteries, 485 and following. Difference between predications, charges of blame, and imputations,
485.

PRELATES, why the, of the church have given the pre-eminence to faith, which is of truth, above
charity, which is of good, 126.

PREPARATION for heaven or for hell, in the world of spirits, has for its end that the internal
and external may agree together and make one, and not disagree and make two, 48*.

PRESENCE.--The origin or cause of presence in the spiritual world, 171. His presence alone
is without reception, but presence and conjunction together are with reception, 341. The truth
of faith constitutes the Lord's presence, 72.

PRESERVATION is perpetual creation, 86. Whence arises perpetual preservation, 85.

PRIEST, chief, of a society in heaven, 266.

PRIMARY.--What is first in respect to end, is first in the mind and its intention, because
it is regarded as primary, 98. Things primary exist, subsist, and persist, from things ultimate,
44.

PRIMEVAL.--In the world, at the present day, nothing is known of the primeval state of man,
which is called a state of integrity, 355. What the primeval state of creation was, and how
man is led back to it by the Lord, 355.

PRINCE of a society in heaven, 14 and following, 266.

PRINCIPLE, the primary, of the church is the good of charity, and not the truth of faith, 126.

PRINCIPLES and PRINCIPIATES, 328.

Obs.--Principiates derive their essence from principles, T.C.R., 177. All things of the body
are principiates, that is, are compositions of fibres, from principles which are receptacles
of love and wisdom, D.L. and W., 369.

PROBITY is one of those virtues which have respect to life, and enter into it, 164.

PROBLEM concerning the soul, 315.

PROCEED, to.--All things which proceed from the Lord, are in an instant from first principles
in last, 389.

PROCREATION, sphere of the love of, 400.

PROGRESSION.--There is no progression of good to evil, but a progression of good to a greater
and less good, and evil to a greater and less evil, 444. A progression from ends through causes
into effects is inscribed on every man in general, and in every particular, 400, 401. Decreasing
progression of conjugial love, 78.

PROLIFICATION corresponds to the propagation of truth, 127. Spiritual prolification is that
of love and wisdom, 51, 52. Origin of natural prolifications, 115. The sphere of prolification
is the same as the universal sphere of the marriage of good and truth, which proceeds from
the Lord, 92. Prolifications are continuations of creation, 183. The principle of prolification
is derived from the intellect alone, 90. In the principle of prolification of the husband is
the soul, and also his mind as to its interiors, which are conjoined to the soul, 172. Its
state with husbands, if married pairs were in the marriage of good and truth, 115.

PROMULGATION, cause of the, of the decalogue by Jehovah God upon Mount Sinai, 351.

PROPAGATE, to.--Love and wisdom, with use, not only constitute man (homo), but also are man,
and propagate man, 183. A feminine principle is propagated from intellectual good, 220. Propagations
are continuations of creation, 183. Propagation of the soul, 220, 236, 238, 245, 321. The propagation
of the human race, and thence of the angelic heaven, was the chief end of creation. 68.

PROPAGATE, or plastic force of vegetables and animals, whence it originated, 138.

PROPRIUM, man's, from his birth is essentially evil, 262. These two propriums are deadly evils
to man, if they remain with him, 194.

PROVIDENCE, the Divine, of the Lord extends to every thing, even to the minutest particulars
concerning marriages, and in marriages, 229, 316. The operations of uses, by the Lord, by the
spheres which proceed from Him, are the Divine Providence, 386, 391.

Obs.--The Divine Providence is the same as the mediate and immediate influx from the Lord,
A.C. 6480. See the Treatise on the Divine Providence, by the Author.

PRUDENCE is one of the moral virtues which have respect to life, and enter into it, 164. Nothing
of prudence can possibly exist but from God, 354. Prudence of wives in concealing their love,
294. This prudence is innate, 187. It was implanted in women from creation, and consequently
by birth, 194. Of self-derived prudence, 354.

PULPIT in a temple in the spiritual world, 23.

PU, or PAU, 28, 29, 182.

Obs.--This is the Greek word [Greek: pou], written in ordinary characters; the Author gives
the Latin translation at n. 28. (In quodam pu seu ubi.) This word expresses the uncertainty
in which philosophers and theologians are on the subject of the soul.

PURE.--It is not possible that any love should become absolutely pure, with men or with angels,
71, 146. To the pure all things are pure, but to them that are defiled, nothing is pure, 140.

PURITY, the, of heaven is from conjugial love, 430. In like manner the purity of the church, 431.

PURPLE, the, color from its correspondence signifies the conjugial love of the wife, 76.

PUSTULES, 253, 470.

PUT AWAY, to.--Putting away on account of adultery is a plenary separation of minds, which
is called divorce, 255. Other kinds of putting away, grounded in their particular causes, are
separations, 255.

PUT OFF, to.--Man after death puts off every thing which does not agree with his love, 36.
How a man after death puts off externals and puts on informals, 48*

PYTHAGORAS, 151*.

PYTHAGOREANS, 153*.

QUALITY of the love of the sex in heaven, 44.

RAINBOW painted on a wall in the spiritual world, 76.

RATIONAL principle, the, is the medium between heaven and the world, 145. Above the rational
principle is heavenly light, and below the rational principle is natural light, 233. The rational
principle is formed more and more to the reception of heaven or of hell, according as man turns
himself towards good or evil, 436.

Obs.--The rational principle of man partakes of the spiritual and natural, or is a medium between
them, A.C., 268.

RATIONALITY, spiritual, comes by means of the Word, and of preachings derived therefrom, 293.
Natural, sensual, and corporeal men enjoy, like other men, the powers of rationality, but they
use it while they are in externals, and abuse it while in their internals, 498, 499. Rationality,
with devils, proceeds from the glory of the love of self, 269, and also with atheists, who
enjoy a more sublime rationality than many others, 269.

RATIONALITY and LIBERTY.--When man turns himself to the Lord, his rationality and liberty are
led by the Lord; but if backwards, from the Lord, his rationality and liberty are led by hell, 437.

REACTION.--In all conjunction by love there must be action, reception, and reaction, 293.

REAL.--Love and wisdom are collected together in use, and therein become one principle, which
is called real, 183.

REASON, human, is such that it understands truths from the light thereof, as though was not
heretofore distinguished them, 490.

REASONERS.--They are named such who never conclude any thing, and make whatever they hear a
matter of argument and dispute whether it be so, with perpetual contradiction, 232. What their
fate is in the other life, 232. Truth does not admit of reasonings, 481. They favor the delights
of the flesh against those of the spirit, 481.

RECEPTION is according to religion, 352. Without conjunction there is no reception, 341. See
Reaction.

RECIPIENT.--Man is a recipient of God, and consequently a recipient of love and wisdom from
Him, 132. A recipient becomes an image of God according to reception, 132.

RECIPROCAL principle, the, of conjunction with God, is, that a man should love God, and relish
the things which are of God, as from himself, and yet believe that they are of God, 132, 122.
Without such a reciprocal principle conjunction is impossible, 132.

REGENERATION is a successive separation from the evils to which man is naturally inclined,
146. Regeneration is purification from evils, and thereby renovation of life, 525. The precepts
of regeneration are five, 525. See Precepts. By regeneration a man is made altogether new as
to his spirit, and this is effected by a life according to the Lord's precepts, 525. In the
lowest man is born; he ascends into the next above it by a life according to the truths of
religion, and into the highest by the marriage of love and wisdom, 305. In each region there
is a marriage of love and wisdom, 270. The pleasantnesses of conjugial love in the highest
region are perceived as blessednesses, in the middle region as satisfactions, and in the lowest
region as delights, 335.

REIGN, to, with Christ is to be wise, and perform uses, 7.

RELATION, there is no, of good to evil, but a relation of good to a greater and less good,
and of evil to a greater and less evil, 444. What is signified by the expression, for the sake
of relatives, 17.

RELATIVES subsist between the greatest and the least of the same thing, 425, 17.

RELIGION constitutes the state of the church with man, 238. Religion is implanted in souls,
and by souls is transmitted from parents to their offspring, as the supreme inclination, 246.
With Christians it is formed by the good of life, agreeable to the truth of doctrine, 115.
Conjugial love is grounded in religion, 238. Where there is not religion, neither is there
conjugial love, 239. There is no religion without the truths of religion; what is religion
without truths, 239. Religion, as it is the marriage of the Lord and the church, is the initiament
and inoculation of conjugial love, 531. That love in its progress accompanies religion, 531.
The first internal cause of cold in marriages is the rejection of religion by each of the parties,
240. The second cause is, that one has religion and not the other, 241. The third is, that
one of the parties is of one religion, and the other of another, 242. The fourth is the falsity
of religion, 243.

Obs.--There is a difference which it is important to bear in mind, between religion and the
church; the church of the Lord, it is true, is universal, and is with all those who acknowledge
a Divine Being, and live in charity whatever else may be their creed; but the church is especially
where the Word is, and where by means of the Word the Lord is known. In the countries where
the Word does not exist, or is withdrawn from the people and replaced by human decisions, as
among the Roman Catholics, there is religion alone, but there is, to speak correctly, no church.
Among Protestants, there is both religion and a church, but this church has come to an end,
because it has perverted the Word.

RENUNCIATION of whoredoms, whence exists the chastity of marriage, how it is effected, 148.

REPASTS.--In heaven, as in the world, there are repasts, 6.

REPRESENTATIONS.--Among the ancients the study of their bodily senses consisted in representations
of truths in forms, 76.

REPRESENTATIVE.--To those who are in the third heaven, every representative of love and wisdom
becomes real, 270.

RESPIRATION OF THE LUNGS, the, has relation to truth, 87.

REST.--What is the meaning of eternal rest, 207.

RETAIN, to--In whatever state man is he retains the faculty of elevating the understanding, 495.

REVELATIONS made at the present day by the Lord, 532.

RIB, by a, of the breast is signified, in the spiritual sense, natural truth, 193.

RIGHT, the, signifies good, 316. It also signifies power, 21.

RITES, customary.--There are customary rites which are merely formal, and there are others
which, at the same time, are also essential, 306.

RIVALSHIP or emulation between married parties respecting right and power, 291. Emulation of
prominence between married partners is one of the external causes of cold, 248.

RULES of life concerning marriages, 77. Universal rule, 147, 313.

SABBATH, the.--The life of heaven from the worship of God, is called a perpetual Sabbath, 9.
Celebration of the Sabbath in a heavenly society, 23, 24.

SACRILEGE.--See Sacrimony.

SACRIMONY.--In heaven, marriage with one wife is called sacrimony, but if it took place with
more than one it would be called sacrilege, 76.

SAGACITY is one of the principles constituent of natural wisdom, 163.

SANCTITIES.--The marriage of the Lord and the church, and the marriage of good and truth, are
essential sanctities, 64. Sanctity of the Holy Scriptures, 24.

SANCTUARY of the tabernacle of worship amongst the most ancient in heaven, 75.

SATANS.--They are called satans who have confirmed themselves in favor of nature to the denial
of God, 380. See Devils. Satan wishing to demonstrate that nature is God, 415.

Obs.--In the Word, by the devil is understood that hell which is to the back, and in which
are the most wicked, called evil genii; and by satan, that hell in which dwell those who are
not so wicked, who are called evil spirits, H. and H., 544.

SATISFACTION.--In love truly conjugial exists a state of satisfaction, 180.

SATURNINE or golden age, 153*.

SATYRS.--In the spiritual world the satyr-like form is the form of dissolute adultery, 521.

SAVED, to be.--All in the universe who acknowledge a God, and, from a religious principle,
shun evil as sins against Him, are saved, 343.

SCIENCE is a principle of knowledges, 130. There is no end to science, 185. Man is not born
into the science of any love, but beasts and birds are born into the science of all their loves,
133. Man is born without sciences, to the end that he may receive them all; whereas, supposing
him to be born into sciences, he could not receive any but those into which he was born, 134.
Science and love are undivided companions, 134.

SCIENCE OF CORRESPONDENCES, the, was among the ancients the science of sciences, 532. It was
the knowledge concerning the spiritual things of heaven and the church, and thence they derived
wisdom, 532. See Correspondences.

SCORBUTIC PHTHISIC, 253, 470.

SCRIPTURE, the sacred, which proceeded immediately from the Lord, is, in general and in particular,
a marriage of good and truth, 115.

SEAT, the, of jealousy is in the understanding of the husband, 372.

SEDUCERS.--Their sad lot after death, 514.

SEE, to, that what is true is true, and that what is false is false, is to see from heavenly
light in natural light, 233.

SEEDS spiritually understood are truths, 220. Formation of seed, 220, 245, 183.

SELF-CONCEIT, or SELF-DERIVED INTELLIGENCE.--The love of wisdom, if it remains with man, and
is not transcribed into the woman, is an evil love, and is called self-conceit, or the love
of his own intelligence, 88, 353. The wife continually attracts to herself her husband's conceit
of his own intelligence, and extinguishes it in him, and verifies it in herself, 353. He who,
from a principle of self-love, is vain of his own intelligence, cannot possibly love his wife
with true conjugial love, 193.

SEMBLANCES, conjugial, 279-289.

SEMINATION corresponds to the potency of truth, 127. It has a spiritual origin, and proceeds
from the truths of which the understanding consists, 220.

SENSATIONS with the pleasures thence derived appertain to the body, and affections with the
thoughts thence derived appertain to the mind, 273.

SENSE.--Every love has its own proper sense, 210. Spiritual origin of the natural senses, 220.
See Taste, Smell, Hearing, Touch, Sight. Each of these senses has its delights, with variations
according to the specific uses of each, 68. The sense proper to conjugial love is the sense
of touch, 210. The use of this sense is the complex of all other uses, 68.

SEPARATIONS of married partners. Legitimate causes thereof, 251-254.

SERENE, principle of peace, 155*.

SERPENT, the, signifies the love of self-intelligence, 353. By the serpent, Gen. iii. is meant

SOPHI.--The most ancient people did not acknowledge any other wisdom than the wisdom of life,
and this was the wisdom of those who were formerly called sophi, 130.

SOUL, the, is the inmost principle of man, 101, 158, 206. It is not life, but the proximate
receptacle of life from God, and thereby the habitation of God, 315. It is a form of all things
relating to love, and of all things relating to wisdom, 315. Propagation of the soul, 220,
245. The soul of the offspring is from the father, and its clothing from the mother, 206, 288.
The principle of truth in the soul is the origin of seed, in which is the soul of man, 220,
483. The soul and the mind are the man, since both constitute the spirit which lives after
death, and which is in a perfect human form, 260. The soul constitutes the inmost principles
not only of the head, but also of the body, 178. The soul and mind adjoin themselves closely
to the flesh of the body, to operate and produce their effects, 178. A masculine soul, 220.

479.

SPEECH, the, of wisdom is to speak from causes, 75. From the thought, which also is spiritual,
speech flows, 220.

SPHERE.--All that which flows from a subject, and encompasses and surrounds it, is named a
sphere, 386. From the Lord, by the spiritual sun, proceeds a sphere of heat and light, or of
love and wisdom, to operate ends which are uses, 386. But the universal of all is the conjugial
sphere, because this is the supereminent sphere of conservation of the created universe, 222.
This sphere fills the universe, and pervades all things from first to last, 222; thus from
angels even to worms, 92. Why it is more universal than the sphere of heat and light which
proceed from the sun, 222. This sphere is received immediately by the female sex, and mediately
by the male, 225. These spheres meet each other in each world, but do not conjoin, 436, 455.
Between these two spheres there is equilibrium, and man is in it, 437, 455. A sphere of love
from the wife, and of understanding from the man, is continually flowing forth, and unites
them, 321. A natural sphere is continually flowing forth, not only from man, but also from
beasts--yea, from trees, fruits, flowers, and also from metals, 171.

SPIRE.--With whom the mind is closed from beneath, and sometimes twisted as a spire into the
adverse principle, 203. The love of marriage is of the spirit, and the love of adultery is
of the flesh, 488. See Flesh.

SPIRITS.--See Mind, obs. By novitiate spirits are meant men newly deceased, who are called
spirits because they are then spiritual men, 461. Who those are, who, after death, become corporeal
spirits, 495.

SPIRITUAL--The difference between what is spiritual and natural is like that between prior
and posterior, which bear no determinate proportion to each other, 326. Spiritual principles
without natural, which are their constituent have no consistence, 52. Spiritual principles
considered in themselves have relation to love and wisdom, 52. The things relating to the church,
which are called spiritual things, reside in the inmost principles with man, 130. By the spiritual
is meant he who loves spiritual things, and thereby is wise from the Lord, 281. A man (homo)
without religion is not spiritual, but remains natural, 149. To become spiritual is to be elevated
out of the natural principle, that is, out of the light and heat of the world into the light
and heat of heaven, 347. Man becomes spiritual in proportion as his rational principle begins
to derive a soul from influx out of heaven, which is the case so far as it is affected and
delighted with wisdom, 145.

SPIRITUALLY, to think, is to think abstractedly from space and time, 328.

the sport of wisdom and love, 75, 183. Games and shows in the heavens, 17.

STABLES signify instructions, 76.

STAGE entertainments. See Actors.

STATES.--The state of a man's life is his quality as to the understanding and the will, 184.

the successive order is, from which it is formed and exists, 313. What was the primeval state,
which is called a state of integrity, 355. Of the state of married partners after death, 45-54.

world, 207.

STUPIDITY of the age, 481.

SUBJECT, every, receives influx according to its form, 86. All a man's affections and thoughts
are in forms, and thence from forms, for forms are their subjects, 186. A subject without predicates
is an entity which has no existence in reason, 66. See Substance.

SUBSISTENCE is perpetual existence, 86.

SUBSTANCE.--There is no substance without a form, an unformed substance not being any thing,
66. There is not any good or truth which is not in a substance as in its subject, 66. Every
idea of man's, however sublimated, is substantial, that is, affixed to substance, 66. Material
things derive their origin from things substantial, 207. In man, all the affections of love,
and all the perceptions of wisdom, are rendered substantial, for substances are their subjects,
361. See Form.

SUBSTANTIAL.--The difference between what is substantial and what is material is like the difference
between what is prior and what is posterior, 31. Spiritual things are substantial, 328. Spirits
and angels are in substantial and not in materials, 328. All things in the spiritual world
are substantial and not material, whence it is that there are in their perfection in that world,
all things which are in the natural world, and many things besides, 207. Every idea of man's,
however sublimated, is substantial, that is, attached to substances, 66.

SUCCESSIVE.--There is a successive order and a simultaneous order, and there is an influx of
successive order into simultaneous order, 314. See Order.

SUMMARY of the Lord's commandments, 340, 82.

SUN.--There is a sun of the spiritual world as there is a sun of the natural world, 380. The
sun of the spiritual world proceeds immediately from the Lord, who is in the midst of it, 235.
That sun is pure love 235, 380, 532. It appears fiery before the angels, altogether as the
sun of our world appears before men, 235. It does not set nor rise, but stands constantly between
the zenith and the horizon, that is, at the elevation of 45 degrees, 137. The spiritual sun
is pure love, and the natural sun is pure fire, 182, 532. Whatever proceeds from the spiritual
sun partakes of life, since it is pure love; whatever proceeds from the natural sun partakes
nothing of life, since it is pure fire, 532. For what end the sun of the natural world was
created, 235. The fire of the natural sun exists from no other source than from the fire of
the spiritual sun, which is divine love, 380.

SUPPERS.--In heaven, as in the world, there are suppers, 19.

SURVIVOR, 321.--See Deceased.

SWEDENBORG.--He protests in truth that the memorable relations annexed to the chapters in this
work are not fictions, but were truly done and seen; not seen in any state of the mind asleep,
but in a state of full wakefulness, 1. He declares, that having related a thousand particulars
respecting departed spirits, he has never heard any one object, how can such be their lot when
they are not yet risen from their sepulchres, the last judgment not being yet accomplished? 28.

SWEDES, 103, 112.

SWEETNESS.--In heaven, the chaste love of the sex is called heavenly sweetness, 55.

SYMPATHIES.--In the spiritual world sympathies are not only felt, but also appear in the face,
the discourse, and gesture, 273. With some married partners in the natural world, there is
antipathy in internals, combined with apparent sympathy in their externals, 292. Sympathy derives
its origin from the concordance of spiritual spheres, which emanate from subjects, 171.

TABERNACLE.--In heaven, the most ancient people dwell in tabernacles, because, whilst in the
world, they lived in tabernacles, 75. Tabernacle of their worship exactly similar to the tabernacle

married partners from heaven present with Swedenborg, 216.

THEATRES in the heavens, 17.--See Actors.

THING, every, created by the Lord is representative, 294. To think and conclude from an interior
and prior principle is to think and conclude from ends and causes to effects, but to think
and conclude from an exterior or posterior principle, is to think and conclude from effects
to causes and ends, 408. The spiritual man thinks of things incomprehensible and ineffable
to the natural man, 326.

THOUGHT is the existere, or existence of a man's life, from the esse or essence, which is love,
36. Spiritual thoughts, compared with natural, are thoughts of thoughts, 326. Spiritual thoughts
are the beginnings and origins of natural thoughts, 320. Spiritual thought so far exceeds natural
thought as to be respectively ineffable, 326.

THUNDER.--Clapping of the air like thunder is a correspondence and consequent appearance of
the conflict and collision of arguments amongst spirits, 415.

TONES, discordant, brought into harmony, 243.

and exists, is a canon which, from its truth, must be acknowledged in the learned world, 313.

ULYSSES, companions of, changed into hogs, 521.

UNCHASTITY, difference between, and what is not chaste, 139. Unchastity is entirely opposed
to chastity, 139. There is a conjugial love which is not chaste, and yet is not unchastity,
139. The love opposite to conjugial love is essential unchastity, 139.

UNCLEAN or FILTHY, every, principle of hell is from adulterers, 500.

UNCLEANNESS, 252, 472.

UNDERSTANDING, the.--Man has understanding from heavenly light, 233. The understanding considered
in itself is merely the ministering and serving principle of the will, 196. It is only the
form of the will, 493. Man is capable of elevating his intellect above his natural loves, 96.
See Will and Understanding.

UNION.--Spiritual union of two married partners is the actual adjunction of the soul and mind
of the one to the soul and mind of the other, 321. Conjugial love is the union of souls, 179,
480, 482. Union between two married partners in heaven is like that of the two tents in the
breast, which are called the heart and the lungs, 75.

UNITY, the, of souls between two married partners in heaven is seen in their faces; the life
of the husband is in the wife, and the life of the wife is in the husband--they are two bodies
but one soul, 75.

UNIVERSALS.--Whoever knows universals may afterwards comprehend particulars, because the latter
are in the former as parts in a whole, 261. Good and truth are the universals of creation,
84, 92. There are three universals of heaven and three universals of hell, 261. A universal
principle exists from, and consists of singulars, 388. If we take away singulars, a universal
is a mere name, and is like somewhat superficial, which has no contents within, 388. A universal
truth is acknowledged by every intelligent man, 60. All thing in the universe have relation
to good and truth, 60. In every thing in the universe good is conjoined with truth, and truth
with good, 60.

USE is essential good, 183, 77. Use is doing good from love by wisdom, 183. Creation can only
be from divine love by divine wisdom, in divine use, 183. All things in the universe are procreated
and formed from use, in use, and for use, 183. All use is from the Lord, and is effected by
angels and men, as of themselves, 7. Uses are the bonds of society; there are as many bonds
as there are uses, and the number of uses is infinite, 18. There are spiritual uses, such as
regard love towards God, and love towards our neighbor, 18. There are natural uses, which regard
the love of the world and its necessities, 18: and there are corporeal uses, such as regard
the love of self-preservation with a view to superior uses, 18. Delights follow use, and are
also communicated to man according to the love thereof, 68. Those who are only in natural and
corporeal uses are satans, loving only the world and themselves, for the sake of the world;
and those who are only in corporeal uses are devils, because they live to themselves alone,
and to others only for the sake of themselves, 18. Happiness is derived to every angel from
the use he performs in his function, 6. To such as faithfully perform uses, the Lord gives
the love thereof, 7. So far as uses are done from the love thereof, so far that love increases,
266. The use of conjugial love is the most excellent of all uses, 183, 305. Conjugial love
is according to the love of growing wise, for the sake of uses from the Lord, 183. How can
any one know whether he performs uses from self-love, or from the love of uses? 266. All good
uses in the heavens are splendid and refulgent, 266. Blessed lot of those who are desirous
to have dominion from the love of uses, 266.

Obs.--Use consists in fulfilling faithfully, sincerely, and carefully, the duties of our functions,

VERNAL, the, principle exists only where warmth is equally united to light, 137. With men (homines)
there is a perpetual influx of vernal warmth from the Lord, it is otherwise with animals, 137.
In heaven, where there is vernal warmth, there is love truly conjugial, 137.

VIOLATION of spiritual marriage, 515-520. Violation of spiritual marriage is violation of the
Word, 516. Violation of the Word is adulteration of good, and falsification of truth, 517.

Christian church, violation of the Word is committed, 519.

WHOREDOM, spiritual, is the falsification of truth, which acts in unity with that which is
natural, because they cohere, 80. Whoredoms in the spiritual sense of the word signify the
connubial connection of what is evil and false, 428. They signify the falsification of truth,
518. Whoredom is the destruction of society, 345. They are imputed to every one after death,
not according to the deeds themselves, but according to the state of the minds in the deeds, 530.
