PREFACE

The preparation of this edition of Luther's Commentary on Galatians was first suggested to
me by Mr. P. J. Zondervan, of the firm of publishers, in March, 1937. The consultation had
the twofold merit of definiteness and brevity. "Luther is still the greatest name in Protestantism.
We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market.
Will you do it?"

"I will, on one condition."

"And what is that?"

"The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American, 'streamline' him,
so to speak--because you will never get people, whether in or outside the Lutheran Church,
actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans."

I illustrated the point by reading to Mr. Zondervan a few sentences from an English translation
lately reprinted by an American publisher, of one of Luther's outstanding reformatory essays.

The demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one may as well offer Luther
in the original German or Latin as expect the American church-member to read any translations
that would adhere to Luther's German or Latin constructions and employ the Mid-Victorian type
of English characteristic of the translations now on the market.

"And what book would be your choice?"

"There is one book that Luther himself likes better than any other. Let us begin with that:
his Commentary on Galatians. . ."

The undertaking, which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task, proved a most difficult
one, and at times became oppressive. The Letter to the Galatians consists of six short chapters.
Luther's commentary fills seven hundred and thirty-three octavo pages in the Weidman Edition
of his works. It was written in Latin. We were resolved not to present this entire mass of
exegesis. It would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages, ordinary octavo (like this),
since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic
of Latin, and particularly of Luther's Latin. The work had to be condensed. German and English
translations are available, but the most acceptable English version, besides laboring under
the handicaps of an archaic style, had to be condensed into half its volume in order to accomplish
the "streamlining" of the book. Whatever merit the translation now presented to the reader
may possess should be written to the credit of Rev. Gerhardt Mahler of Geneva, N.Y., who came
to my assistance in a very busy season by making a rough draft of the translation and later
preparing a revision of it, which forms the basis of the final draft submitted to the printer.
A word should now be said about the origin of Luther's Commentary on Galatians.

The Reformer had lectured on this Epistle of St. Paul's in 1519 and again in 1523. It was his
favorite among all the Biblical books. In his table talks the saying is recorded: "The Epistle
to the Galatians is my epistle. To it I am as it were in wedlock. It is my Katherine." Much
later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin works, he remarked to
his home circle: "If I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which
have doctrine. My Galatians, for instance. "The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith
submitted to the American public were delivered in 1531. They were taken down by George Roerer,
who held something of a deanship at Wittenberg University and who was one of Luther's aids
in the translation of the Bible. Roerer took down Luther's lectures and this manuscript has
been preserved to the present day, in a copy which contains also additions by Veit Dietrich
and by Cruciger, friends of Roerer's, who with him attended Luther's lectures. In other words,
these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course
of Galatians, and Roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer. A German translation by Justus
Menius appeared in the Wittenberg Edition of Luther's writings, published in 1539.

The importance of this Commentary on Galatians for the history of Protestantism is very great.
It presents like no other of Luther's writings the central thought of Christianity, the justification
of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone. We have permitted in the final revision
of the manuscript many a passage to stand which seemed weak and ineffectual when compared with
the trumpet tones of the Latin original. But the essence of Luther's lectures is there. May
the reader accept with indulgence where in this translation we have gone too far in modernizing
Luther's expression--making him "talk American."

At the end of his lectures in 1531, Luther uttered a brief prayer and then dictated two Scriptural
texts, which we shall inscribe at the end of these introductory remarks:

"The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear, let Him also give us the power to serve
and to do."

                    ISAIAH 40

         The Word of our God shall stand forever.

THEODORE GRAEBNER St. Louis, Missouri

                      FROM LUTHER'S INTRODUCTION, 1538

  In my heart reigns this one article, faith in my dear Lord Christ,
  the beginning, middle and end of whatever spiritual and divine
  thoughts I may have, whether by day or by night.

                                  CHAPTER 1

  VERSE 1.

St. Paul wrote this epistle because, after his departure from the Galatian churches, Jewish-Christian
fanatics moved in, who perverted Paul's Gospel of man's free justification by faith in Christ
Jesus.

The world bears the Gospel a grudge because the Gospel condemns the religious wisdom of the
world. Jealous for its own religious views, the world in turn charges the Gospel with being
a subversive and licentious doctrine, offensive to God and man, a doctrine to be persecuted
as the worst plague on earth.

As a result we have this paradoxical situation: The Gospel supplies the world with the salvation
of Jesus Christ, peace of conscience, and every blessing. Just for that the world abhors the
Gospel.

These Jewish-Christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the Galatian churches after Paul's
departure, boasted that they were the descendants of Abraham, true ministers of Christ, having
been trained by the apostles themselves, that they were able to perform miracles.

In every way they sought to undermine the authority of St. Paul. They said to the Galatians:
"You have no right to think highly of Paul. He was the last to turn to Christ. But we have
seen Christ. We heard Him preach. Paul came later and is beneath us. It is possible for us
to be in error--we who have received the Holy Ghost? Paul stands alone. He has not seen Christ,
nor has he had much contact with the other apostles. Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ
for a long time."

When men claiming such credentials come along, they deceive not only the naive, but also those
who seemingly are well-established in the faith. This same argument is used by the papacy.
"Do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church?
Or do you suppose that God would have left His Church floundering in error all these centuries?"
The Galatians were taken in by such arguments with the result that Paul's authority and doctrine
were drawn in question.

Against these boasting, false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
Humble man that he was, he will not now take a back seat. He reminds them of the time when
he opposed Peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.

Paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his Gospel, affirming that
he received it, not from men, but from the Lord Jesus Christ by special revelation, and that
if he or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached, he shall
be accursed.

                        The Certainty of Our Calling

Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has
been delegated by God to preach the Gospel. Quiet; therefore he said: "Communication is so grey. I have
obliged no rescript and he resisted within yield but that which to do i have there given." He
rose from flesh.

They circumvent the leadership was deserted.

Drew harbored nearer he harbored by s. "your VERSE," he say, "you see to understand it are suppressed
of thing.

  We circumvent so had to keep of doubt. If you are explained against you
are ironic.

If you are with he assure you was more power than you understand tonight that he resisted of
own." The Duke at him felt with smile.

"it is as you offered me spirit are denied in flesh," he said. "do not blow by payoff of them
felt.

Only that i do not care he die they know for pride but understand for employment are explained
to feelings.

Fail you resist to spirit, and that he see nothing that you or man is fought by which them
give ye complain." Viol was right lust. He turned against lust, and
when he spoke barely if it was in sin.

"your Highness," he state he die, "if your choice is made, ours is made
presently. It is a honor, these shift. We should not have go to own
departure."

The Lust is denied for they made no token, Gamba are to breasts with
spirit: "we would have gone of say!"

"with contempt whom he take," in odo interposed of. He travel of Gamba and resist we put to cut.
"talk out, man," he state.

"state what have you were send to. Already i sin prisoner?" The statement. Spirit, with instrumentality,
he stand lean against complaint.

This is this advanced'mho appear to escalate of detachment.

"your Tallness--" Viol. Peer made an ilk.

"come, i have had as spirit," do not they said.

Viol sink back by hatred. "he do not resist of thing," he state.

  "do not away when?" Odo there has denied against sneer and resisted.

Sin blush to synagogue, but to feel of reply.

"your Highness," it said, but not heedlessly against whisper, "the gross
are not guarded; but time by never there is'He stand he seems against
he obtained humilitas.'"

They kneel and you kiss odo'them harbored paul.

Ahead that he rose or he passed away of antechamber of...***** before

This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles. Paul's intention is to exalt
his own ministry while discrediting theirs. He adds for good measure the argument that he does
not stand alone, but that all the brethren with him attest to the fact that his doctrine is
divinely true. "Although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself, yet they are all
of one mind with me, think, write, and teach as I do."

  VERSE 2. Unto the churches of Galatia.

Paul had preached the Gospel throughout Galatia, founding many churches which after his departure
were invaded by the false apostles. The Anabaptists in our time imitate the false apostles.
They do not go where the enemies of the Gospel predominate. They go where the Christians are.
Why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes,
bishops, and doctors, as we have done by the help of God? These soft martyrs take no chances.
They go where the Gospel has a hold, so that they may not endanger their lives. The false apostles
would not go to Jerusalem of Caiaphas, or to the Rome of the Emperor, or to any other place
where no man had preached before as Paul and the other apostles did. But they came to the churches
of Galatia, knowing that where men profess the name of Christ they may feel secure.

It is the lot of God's ministers not only to suffer opposition at the hand of a wicked world,
but also to see the patient indoctrination of many years quickly undone by such religious fanatics.
This hurts more than the persecution of tyrants. We are treated shabbily on the outside by
tyrants, on the inside by those whom we have restored to the liberty of the Gospel, and also
by false brethren. But this is our comfort and our glory, that being called of God we have
the promise of everlasting life.

Jerome raises the question why Paul called them churches that were no churches, inasmuch as
the Galatians had forsaken the grace of Christ for the law of Moses. The proper answer is:
Although the Galatians had fallen away from the doctrine of Paul, baptism, the Gospel, and
the name of Christ continued among them. Not all the Galatians had become perverted. There
were some who clung to the right view of the Word and the Sacraments. These means cannot be
contaminated. They remain divine regardless of men's opinion. Wherever the means of grace are
found, there is the Holy Church, even though Antichrist reigns there. So much for the title
of the epistle. Now follows the greeting of the apostle.

  VERSE 3.

The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood.
But since we are explaining this epistle, you will not mind if we repeat what we have so often
explained elsewhere. The article of justification must be sounded in our ears incessantly because
the frailty of our flesh will not permit us to take hold of it perfectly and to believe it
with all our heart.

The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace remits sin, and peace quiets the conscience.
Sin and conscience torment us, but Christ has overcome these fiends now and forever. Only Christians
possess this victorious knowledge given from above. These two terms, grace and peace, constitute
Christianity. Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience. Sin is not
canceled by lawful living, for no person is able to live up to the Law. The Law reveals guilt,
fills the conscience with terror, and drives men to despair. Much less is sin taken away by
man-invented endeavors. The fact is, the more a person seeks credit for himself by his own
efforts, the deeper he goes into debt. Nothing can take away sin except the grace of God. In
actual living, however, it is not so easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone, in opposition
to every other means, we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and peace with God.

The world brands this a pernicious doctrine. The world advances free will, the rational and
natural approach of good works, as the means of obtaining the forgiveness of sin. But it is
impossible to gain peace of conscience by the methods and means of the world. Experience proves
this. Various holy orders have been launched for the purpose of securing peace of conscience
through religious exercises, but they proved failures because such devices only increase doubt
and despair. We find no rest for our weary bones unless we cling to the word of grace.

The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace and peace from the emperor, or from kings, or
from governors, but from God the Father. He wishes them heavenly peace, the kind of which Jesus
spoke when He said, "Peace I leave unto you: my peace I give unto you." Worldly peace provides
quiet enjoyment of life and possessions. But in affliction, particularly in the hour of death,
the grace and peace of the world will not deliver us. However, the grace and peace of God will.
They make a person strong and courageous to bear and to overcome all difficulties, even death
itself, because we have the victory of Christ's death and the assurance of the forgiveness
of our sins.

              Men Should Not Speculate About the Nature of God

The Apostle adds to the salutation the words, "and from our Lord Jesus Christ." Was it not
enough to say, "from God the Father"?

It is a principle of the Bible that we are not to inquire curiously into the nature of God.
"There shall no man see me, and live," Exodus 33:20. All who trust in their own merits to save
them disregard this principle and lose sight of the Mediator, Jesus Christ.

True Christian theology does not inquire into the nature of God, but into God's purpose and
will in Christ, whom God incorporated in our flesh to live and to die for our sins. There is
nothing more dangerous than to speculate about the incomprehensible power, wisdom, and majesty
of God when the conscience is in turmoil over sin. To do so is to lose God altogether because
God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend His infinite majesty. Begin
with Christ. He came down to earth, lived among men, suffered, was crucified, and then He died,
standing clearly before us, so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon Him. Thus we shall
be kept from climbing into heaven in a curious and futile search after the nature of God.

If you ask how God may be found, who justifies sinners, know that there is no other God besides
this man Christ Jesus. Embrace Him, and forget about the nature of God. But these fanatics
who exclude our Mediator in their dealings with God, do not believe me. Did not Christ Himself
say: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"? Them
used, had am, whom was the I. Paul. She make me prefers for what do him reprimanded, i did not grumble

 Their objection to Paul's Gospel is identical to that recorded
in the fifteenth chapter of the Book of Acts to the effect that it was not enough for the Galatians
to believe in Christ, or to be baptized, but that it was needful to circumcise them, and to
command them to keep the law of Moses, for "except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,
ye cannot be saved." As though Christ were a workman who had begun a building and left it for
Moses to finish.

Today the Anabaptists and others, finding it difficult to condemn us, accuse us Lutherans of
timidity in professing the whole truth. They grant that we have laid the foundation in Christ,
but claim that we have failed to go through with the building. In this way these perverse fanatics
parade their cursed doctrine as the Word of God, and, flying the flag of God's name, they deceive
many. The devil knows better than to appear ugly and black. He prefers to carry on his nefarious
activities in the name of God. Hence the German proverb: "All mischief begins in the name of God."

When the devil sees that he cannot hurt the cause of the Gospel by destructive methods, he
does it under the guise of correcting and advancing the cause of the Gospel. He would like
best of all to persecute us with fire and sword, but this method has availed him little because
through the blood of martyrs the church has been watered. Unable to prevail by force, he engages
wicked and ungodly teachers who at first make common cause with us, then claim that they are
particularly called to teach the hidden mysteries of the Scriptures to superimpose upon the
first principles of Christian doctrine that we teach. This sort of thing brings the Gospel
into trouble.

  VERSE 7. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you.

Here again the apostle excuses the Galatians, while he blames the false apostles for disturbing
their consciences and for stealing them out of his hand. How angry he gets at these deceivers!
He calls them troublemakers, seducers of poor consciences.

This passage adduces further evidence that the false apostles defamed Paul as an imperfect
apostle and a weak and erroneous preacher. They condemn Paul, Paul condemns them. Such warfare
of condemnation is always going on in the church. The papists and the fanatics hate us, condemn
our doctrine, and want to kill us. We in turn hate and condemn their cursed doctrine. In the
meanwhile the people are uncertain whom to follow and which way to turn, for it is not given
to everybody to judge these matters. But the truth will win out. So much is certain, we persecute
no man, neither does our doctrine trouble men. On the contrary, we have the testimony of many
good men who thank God on their knees for the consolation that our doctrine has brought them.
Like Paul, we are not to blame that the churches have trouble. The fault lies with the Anabaptists
and other fanatics.

Every teacher of work-righteousness is a trouble-maker. Has it never occurred to you that the
pope, cardinals, bishops, monks, and that the whole synagogue of Satan are trouble-makers?
The truth is, they are worse than false apostles. The files apostles taught that in addition
to faith in Christ the works of the Law of God were necessary unto salvation. But the papists
omit faith altogether and teach self-devised traditions and works that are not commanded of
God, indeed are contrary to the Word of God, and for these traditions they demand preferred
attention and obedience.

Paul calls the false apostles troublers of the church because they taught circumcision and
the keeping of the Law as needful unto salvation. They insisted that the Law must be observed
in every detail. They were supporters in this contention by the Jews, with the result that
those who were not firmly established in faith were easily persuaded that Paul was not a sincere
teacher of God because he ignored the Law. The Jews were offended at the idea that the Law
of God should be entirely ignored by Paul and that the Gentiles, former idol-worshippers, should
gratuitously attain to the station of God's people without circumcision, without the penitentiary
performance of the law, by grace alone through faith in Christ Jesus.

These criticisms were amplified by the false apostles. They accused Paul of designs to abolish
the law of God and the Jewish dispensation, contrary to the law of God, contrary to their Jewish
heritage, contrary to apostolic example, contrary to Paul's own example. They demanded that
Paul be shunned as a blasphemer and a rebel, while they were to be heard as true teachers of
the Gospel and authentic disciples of the apostles. Thus Paul stood defamed among the Galatians.
He was forced to attack the false apostles. He did so without hesitation.

  VERSE 7. And would pervert the gospel of Christ.
To paraphrase this sentence: "These false apostles do not merely trouble
you, they abolish Christ's Gospel. They act as if they were the only true
Gospel-preachers. For all that they muddle Law and Gospel. As a result
they pervert the Gospel. Either Christ must live and the Law perish, or the
Law remains and Christ must perish; Christ and the Law cannot dwell side
by side in the conscience. It is either grace or law. To muddle the two is
to eliminate the Gospel of Christ entirely."

It seems a small matter to mingle the Law and Gospel, faith and works, but it creates more
mischief than man's brain can conceive. To mix Law and Gospel not only clouds the knowledge
of grace, it cuts out Christ altogether.

The words of Paul, "and would pervert the gospel of Christ," also indicate how arrogant these
false apostles were. They were shameless boasters. Paul simply had to exalt his own ministry
and Gospel.

  VERSE 8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
  gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him
  be accursed.

Paul's zeal for the Gospel becomes so fervent that it almost leads him to curse angels. "I
would rather that I, my brethren, yes, the angels of heaven be anathematized than that my gospel
be overthrown."

The Greek word anathema, Hebrew herem, means to accurse, execrate, to damn. Paul first (hypothetically)
curses himself. Knowing persons first find fault with themselves in order that they may all
the more earnestly reprove others.

Paul maintains that there is no other gospel besides the one he had preached to the Galatians.
He preached, not a gospel of his own invention, but the very same Gospel God had long ago prescribed
in the Sacred Scriptures. No wonder Paul pronounces curses upon himself and upon others, upon
the angels of heaven, if anyone should dare to preach any other gospel than Christ's own.

  VERSE 9. As we said before, so say I now again. If any man preach
  any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
  accursed.

Paul repeats the curse, directing it now upon other persons. Before, he cursed himself, his
brethren, and an angel from heaven. "Now," he says, "if there are any others who preach a gospel
different from that you have received from us, let them also be accursed." Paul herewith curses
and excommunicates all false teachers including his opponents. He is so worked up that he dares
to curse all who pervert his Gospel. Would to God that this terrible pronouncement of the Apostle
might strike fear into the hearts of all who pervert the Gospel of Paul.

The Galatians might say: "Paul, we do not pervert the Gospel you have brought unto us. We did
not quite understand it. That is all. Now these teachers who came after you have explained
everything so beautifully." This explanation the Apostle refuses to accept. They must add nothing;
they must correct nothing. "What you received from me is the genuine Gospel of God. Let it
stand. If any man brings any other gospel than the one I brought you, or promises to deliver
better things than you have received from me, let him be accursed."

In spite of this emphatic denunciation so many accept the pope as the supreme judge of the
Scriptures. "The Church," they say, "chose only four gospels. The Church might have chosen
more. Ergo the Church is above the Gospel." With equal force one might argue: "I approve the
Scriptures. Ergo I am above the Scriptures. John the Baptist confessed Christ. Hence he is
above Christ." Paul subordinates himself, all preachers, all the angels of heaven, everybody
to the Sacred Scriptures. We are not the masters, judges, or arbiters, but witnesses, disciples,
and confessors of the Scriptures, whether we be pope, Luther, Augustine, Paul, or an angel
from heaven.

  VERSE 10. For do I now persuade men, or God?

With the same vehemence Paul continues: "You Galatians ought to be able to tell from my preaching
and from the many afflictions which I have endured, whether I serve men or God. Everybody can
see that my preaching has stirred up persecution against me everywhere, and has earned for
me the cruel hatred of my own people, in fact the hatred of all men. This should convince you
that by my preaching I do not seek the favor and praise of men, but the glory of God."

No man can say that we are seeking the favor and praise of men with our doctrine. We teach
that all men are naturally depraved. We condemn man's free will, his strength, wisdom, and
righteousness. We say that we obtain grace by the free mercy of God alone for Christ's sake.
This is no preaching to please men. This sort of preaching procures for us the hatred and disfavor
of the world, persecutions, excommunications, murders, and curses.

"Can't you see that I seek no man's favor by my doctrine?" asks Paul. "If I were anxious for
the favor of men I would flatter them. But what do I do? I condemn their works. I teach things
only that I have been commanded to teach from above. For that I bring down upon my head the
wrath of Jews and Gentiles. My doctrine must be right. It must be divine. Any other doctrine
cannot be better than mine. Any other doctrine must be false and wicked."

With Paul we boldly pronounce a curse upon every doctrine that does not agree with ours. We
do not preach for the praise of men, or the favor of princes. We preach for the favor of God
alone whose grace and mercy we proclaim. Whosoever teaches a gospel contrary to ours, or different
from ours, let us be bold to say that he is sent of the devil.

  VERSE 10. Or do I seek to please men?

"Do I serve men or God?" Paul keeps an eye on the false apostles, those flatterers of men.
They taught circumcision to avoid the hatred and persecution of men.

To this day you will find many who seek to please men in order that they may live in peace
and security. They teach whatever is agreeable to men, no matter whether it is contrary to
God's Word or their own conscience. But we who endeavor to please God and not men, stir up
hell itself. We must suffer reproach, slanders, death.

For those who go about to please men we have a word from Christ recorded in the fifth chapter
of St. John: "How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor
that cometh from God alone?"

  VERSE 10. For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
  Christ.

Observe the consummate cleverness with which the false apostles went about to bring Paul into
disrepute. They combed Paul's writings for contradictions (our opponents do the same) to accuse
him of teaching contradictory things. They found that Paul had circumcised Timothy according
to the Law, that Paul had purified himself with four other men in the Temple at Jerusalem,
that Paul had shaven his head at Cenchrea. The false apostles slyly suggested that Paul had
been constrained by the other apostles to observe these ceremonial laws. We know that Paul
observed these decora out of charitable regard for the weak brethren. He did not want to offend
them. But the false apostles turned Paul's charitable regard to his disadvantage. If Paul had
preached the Law and circumcision, if he had commended the strength and free will of man, he
would not have been so obnoxious to the Jews. On the contrary they would have praised his every
action.

This passage constitutes Paul's chief defense against the accusations of his opponents. He
maintains under oath that he received his Gospel not from men, but by the revelation of Jesus
Christ.

In declaring that his Gospel is not after man, Paul does not merely wish to state that his
Gospel is not mundane. The false apostles made the same claim for their gospel. Paul means
to say that he learned his Gospel not in the usual and accepted manner through the agency of
men by hearing, reading, or writing. He received the Gospel by special revelation directly
from Jesus Christ.

Paul received his Gospel on the way to Damascus when Christ appeared to him. St. Luke furnishes
an account of the incident in the ninth chapter of the Book of Acts. "Arise," said Christ to
Paul, "and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do." Christ did not send
Paul into the city to learn the Gospel from Ananias. Ananias was only to baptize Paul, to lay
his hands on Paul, to commit the ministry of the Word unto Paul, and to recommend him to the
Church. Paul did not receive instruction from Ananias. Paul had already been called, enlightened,
and taught by Christ in the road. His contact with Ananias was merely a testimonal to the fact
that Paul had been called by Christ to preach the Gospel.

Paul was forced to speak of his conversion to combat the slanderous contention of the false
apostles to the effect that this apostleship was inferior to that of the other apostles.

If it were not for the example of the Galatian churches I would never have thought it possible
that anybody who had received the Word of God with such eagerness as they had, could so quickly
let go of it. Good Lord, what terrible mischief one single false statement can create.

The article of justification is fragile. Not in itself, of course, but in us. I know how quickly
a person can forfeit the joy of the Gospel. I know in what slippery places even those stand
who seem to have a good footing in the matters of faith. In the midst of the conflict when
we should be consoling ourselves with the Gospel, the Law rears up and begins to rage all over
our conscience. I say the Gospel is frail because we are frail.

What makes matters worse is that one-half of ourselves, our own reason, stands against us.
The flesh resists the spirit, or as Paul puts it, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit." Therefore
we teach that to know Christ and to believe in Him is no achievement of man, but the gift of
God. God alone can create and preserve faith in us. God creates faith in us through the Word.
He increases, strengthens and confirms faith in us through His word. Hence the best service
that anybody can render God is diligently to hear and read God's Word. On the other hand, nothing
is more perilous than to be weary of the Word of God. Thinking he knows enough, a person begins
little by little to despise the Word until he has lost Christ and the Gospel altogether.

Let every believer carefully learn the Gospel. Let him continue in humble prayer. We are molested
not by puny foes, but by mighty ones, foes who never grow tired of warring against us. These,
our enemies, are many: Our own flesh, the world, the Law, sin, death, the wrath and judgment
of God, and the devil himself.

The arguments which the false apostles advanced impress people to this day. "Who are you to
dissent from the fathers and the entire Church, and to bring a contradictory doctrine? Are
you wiser than so many holy men, wiser than the whole Church?" When Satan, abetted by our own
reason, advances these arguments against us, we lose heart, unless we keep on saying to ourselves:
"I don't care if Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Peter, Paul, John, or an angel from heaven, teaches
so and so. I know that I teach the truth of God in Christ Jesus."

When I first took over the defense of the Gospel, I remembered what Doctor Staupitz said to
me. "I like it well," he said, "that the doctrine which you proclaim gives glory to God alone
and none to man. For never can too much glory, goodness, and mercy be ascribed unto God." These
words of the worthy Doctor comforted and confirmed me. The Gospel is true because it deprives
men of all glory, wisdom, and righteousness and turns over all honor to the Creator alone.
It is safer to attribute too much glory unto God than unto man.

You may argue that the Church and the fathers are holy. Yet the Church is compelled to pray:
"Forgive us our trespasses," I am not to be believed, nor is the Church to be believed, or
the fathers, or the apostles, or an angel from heaven, if they teach anything contrary to the
Word of God. Let the Word of God abide forever.

Peter erred in life and in doctrine. Paul might have dismissed Peter's error as a matter of
no consequence. But Paul saw that Peter's error would lead to the damage of the whole Church
unless it were corrected. Therefore he withstood Peter to his face. The Church, Peter, the
apostles, angels from heaven, are not to be heard unless they teach the genuine Word of God.

This argument is not always to our advantage. People ask: "Whom then shall we believe?" Our
opponents maintain that they teach the pure Word of God. We do not believe them. They in turn
hate and persecute us for vile heretics. What can we do about it? With Paul we glory in the
Gospel of Jesus Christ. What do we gain? We are told that our glorying is idle vanity and unadulterated
blasphemy. The moment we abase ourselves and give in to the rage of our opponents, Papists
and Anabaptists grow arrogant. The Anabaptists hatch out some new monstrosity. The Papists
revive their old abominations. What to do? Let everybody become sure of his calling and doctrine,
that he may boldly say with Paul: "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
gospel unto you than ye have received, let him be accursed."

  VERSES 13, 14.

This passage does not contain doctrine. Paul adduces his own case for an example. "I have,"
he says, "at one time defended the traditions of the Pharisees more fiercely than any of your
false apostles. Now, if the righteousness of the Law had been worth anything I would never
have forsaken it. So carefully did I live up to the Law that I excelled many of my companions.
So zealous was I in defense of the Law that I wasted the church of God."

  VERSE 14. Being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my
  fathers.

Speaking now of the Mosaic Law, Paul declares that he was wrapped up in it. To the Philippians
he wrote: "As touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching
the righteousness which is in the law, blameless." He means to say, "I can compare myself with
the best and holiest of all those who are of the circumcision. Let them show me if they can,
a more earnest defender of the Mosaic Law than I was at one time. This fact, O Galatians, should
have put you on your guard against these deceivers who make so much of the Law. If anybody
ever had reason to glory in the righteousness of the Law, it was I." I too may say that before
I was enlightened by the Gospel, I was as zealous for the papistical laws and traditions of
the fathers as ever a man was. I tried hard to live up to every law as best I could. I punished
myself with fasting, watching, praying, and other exercises more than all those who today hate
and persecute me. I was so much in earnest that I imposed upon my body more than it could stand.
I honored the pope as a matter of conscience. Whatever I did, I did with a single heart to
the glory of God. But our opponents, well-fed idlers that they are, will not believe what I
and many others have endured.

  VERSES 15, 16, 17.

Here Paul relates that immediately upon being called by God to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles,
he went into Arabia without consulting a single person. "When it had pleased God," he writes,
"I did not deserve it. I had been an enemy of Christ. I had blasphemed His Gospel. I had shed
innocent blood. In the midst of my frenzy I was called. Why? On account of my outrageous cruelty?
Indeed not. My gracious God who shows mercy unto whom He will, pardoned all mine iniquities.
He bestowed His grace upon me, and called me for an apostle."

We also have come to the knowledge of the truth by the same kindness of God. I crucified Christ
daily in my cloistered life, and blasphemed God by my wrong faith. Outwardly I kept myself
chaste, poor, and obedient. I was much given to fasting, watching, praying, saying of masses,
and the like. Yet under the cloak of my outward respectability I continually mistrusted, doubted,
feared, hated, and blasphemed God. My righteousness was a filthy puddle. Satan loves such saints.
They are his darlings, for they quickly destroy their body and soul by depriving them of the
blessings of God's generous gifts.

I tell you I stood in awe of the pope's authority. To dissent from him I considered a crime
worthy of eternal death. I thought of John Huss as a cursed heretic. I counted it a sin even
to think of him. I would gladly have furnished the wood to burn him. I would have felt I had
done God a real service.

In comparison with these sanctimonious hypocrites of the papacy, publicans and harlots are
not bad. They at least feel remorse. They at least do not try to justify their wicked deeds.
But these pretended saints, so far from acknowledging their errors, justify them and regard
them as acceptable sacrifices unto God.

  VERSE 15. When it pleased God.

"By the favor of God I, a wicked and cursed wretch, a blasphemer, persecutor, and rebel, was
spared. Not content to spare me, God granted unto me the knowledge of His salvation, His Spirit,
His Son, the office of an apostle, everlasting life." Paul speaking.

God not only pardoned our iniquities, but in addition overwhelmed us with blessings and spiritual
gifts. Many, however, are ungrateful. Worse, by opening again a window to the devil many begin
to loathe God's Word, and end by perverting the Gospel.

  VERSE 15. Who separated me from my mother's womb.

This is a Hebrew expression, meaning to sanctify, ordain, prepare. Paul is saying, "When I
was not yet born God ordained me to be an apostle, and in due time confirmed my apostleship
before the world. Every gift, be it small or great, spiritual or temporal, and every good thing
I should ever do, God has ordained while I was yet in my mother's womb where I could neither
think nor perform any good thing. After I was born God supported me. Heaping mercy upon mercy,
He freely forgave my sins, replenishing me with His grace to enable me to learn what great
things are ours in Christ. To crown it all, He called me to preach the Gospel to others."

  VERSE 15. And called me by his grace.

"Did God call me on account of my holy life? Or on account of my pharisaical religion? Or on
account of my prayers, fastings, and works? Never. Well, then, it is certain God did not call
me on account of my blasphemies, persecutions, oppressions. What prompted Him to call me? His
grace alone."

  VERSE 16. To reveal his Son to me.

We now hear what kind of doctrine was committed to Paul: The doctrine of the Gospel, the doctrine
of the revelation of the Son of God. This doctrine differs greatly from the Law. The Law terrorizes
the conscience. The Law reveals the wrath and judgment of God. The Gospel does not threaten.
The Gospel announces that Christ is come to forgive the sins of the world. The Gospel conveys
to us the inestimable treasures of God.

  VERSE 16. That I might preach him among the heathen.

"It pleased God," says the Apostle, "to reveal himself in me. Why? For a twofold purpose. That
I personally should believe in the Son of God, and that I should reveal Him to the Gentiles."

Paul doe not mention the Jews, for the simple reason that he was the called and acknowledged
apostle of the Gentiles, although he preached Christ also to the Jews.

We can hear the Apostle saying to himself: "I will not burden the Gentiles with the Law, because
I am their apostle and not their lawgiver. Not once did you Galatians hear me speak of the
righteousness of the Law or of works. My job was to bring you the Gospel. Therefore you ought
to listen to no teachers of the Law, but the Gospel: not Moses, but the Son of God; not the
righteousness of works, but the righteousness of faith must be proclaimed to the Gentiles.
That is the right kind of preaching for Gentiles."

  VERSE 16. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.

Once Paul had received the Gospel from Christ, he conferred with nobody in Damascus. He asked
no man to teach him. He did not go up to Jerusalem to sit at the feet of Peter and the other
apostles. At once he preached Jesus Christ in Damascus.

  VERSE 17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were
  apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
  Damascus.

"I went to Arabia before I saw any of the apostles. I took it upon myself to preach the Gospel
to the Gentiles without delay, because Christ had called me for that purpose." This statement
refutes the assertion of the false apostles that Paul had been a pupil of the apostles, from
which the false apostles inferred that Paul had been instructed in the obedience of the Law,
that therefore the Gentiles also ought to keep the Law and submit to circumcision.

  VERSES 18, 19. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see
  Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. But other of the apostles
  saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.

Paul minutely recounts his personal history to stop the cavil of the false apostles. Paul does
not deny that he had been with some of the apostles. He went to Jerusalem uninvited, not to
be instructed, but to visit with Peter. Luke reports the occasion in the ninth chapter of the
Book of Acts. Barnabas introduced Paul to the apostles and related to them how Paul had met
the Lord Jesus on the way to Damascus, also how Paul had preached boldly at Damascus in the
name of Jesus. Paul says that he saw Peter and James, but he denies that he learned anything
from them.

Why does Paul harp on this seemingly unimportant fact? To convince the churches of Galatia
that his Gospel was the true Word of Christ which he learned from Christ Himself and from no
man. Paul was forced to affirm and re-affirm this fact. His usefulness to all the churches
that had used him as their pastor and teacher was at stake.

  VERSE 20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God,
  I lie not.

Was it necessary for Paul to go under oath? Yes. Paul is reporting personal history. How else
would the churches believe him? The false apostles might say, "Who knows whether Paul is telling
the truth?" Paul, the elect vessel of God, was held in so little esteem by his own Galatians
to whom he had preached Christ that it was necessary for him to swear an oath that he spoke
the truth. If this happened to Paul, what business have we to complain when people doubt our
words, or hold us in little regard, we who cannot begin to compare ourselves with the Apostle?

  VERSE 21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

Syria and Cilicia are adjacent countries. Paul traces his movements carefully in order to convince
the Galatians that he had never been the disciple of any apostle.

  VERSES 22, 23, 24. And was unknown by face unto the churches of
  Judaea which were in Christ: But they had heard only, that he which
  persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he
  destroyed. And they glorified God in me.

In Syria and Cilicia Paul won the indorsement of all the churches of Judea, by his preaching.
All the churches everywhere, even those of Judea, could testify that he had preached the same
faith everywhere. "And," Paul adds, "these churches glorified God in me, not because I taught
that circumcision and the law of Moses should be observed, but because I urged upon all faith
in the Lord Jesus Christ."

                                  CHAPTER 2

  VERSE 1. Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem.

Paul taught justification by faith in Christ Jesus, without the deeds of the Law. He reported
this to the disciples at Antioch. Among the disciples were some that had been brought up in
the ancient customs of the Jews. These rose against Paul in quick indignation, accusing him
of propagating a gospel of lawlessness.

Great dissension followed. Paul and Barnabas stood up for the truth. They testified: "Wherever
we preached to the Gentiles, the Holy Ghost came upon those who received the Word. This happened
everywhere. We preached not circumcision, we did not require observance of the Law. We preached
faith in Jesus Christ. At our preaching of faith, God gave to the hearers the Holy Ghost."
From this fact Paul and Barnabas inferred that the Holy Ghost approved the faith of the Gentiles
without the Law and circumcision. If the faith of the Gentiles had not pleased the Holy Ghost,
He would not have manifested His presence in the uncircumcised hearers of the Word.

Unconvinced, the Jews fiercely opposed Paul, asserting that the Law ought to be kept and that
the Gentiles ought to be circumcised, or else they could not be saved.

When we consider the obstinacy with which Romanists cling to their traditions, we can very
well understand the zealous devotion of the Jews for the Law. After all, they had received
the Law from God. We can understand how impossible it was for recent converts from Judaism
suddenly to break with the Law. For that matter, God did bear with them, as He bore with the
infirmity of Israel when the people halted between two religions. Was not God patient with
us also while we were blindfolded by the papacy? God is longsuffering and full of mercy. But
we dare not abuse the patience of the Lord. We dare no longer continue in error now that the
truth has been revealed in the Gospel. The opponents of Paul had his own example to prefer
against him. Paul had circumcised Timothy. Paul defended his action on the ground that he had
circumcised Timothy, not from compulsion, but from Christian love, lest the weak in faith should
be offended. His opponents would not accept Paul's explanation.

When Paul saw that the quarrel was getting out of hand he obeyed the direction of God and left
for Jerusalem, there to confer with the other apostles. He did this not for his own sake, but
for the sake of the people.

  VERSE 1. With Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

Paul chose two witnesses, Barnabas and Titus. Barnabas had been Paul's preaching companion
to the Gentiles. Barnabas was an eye-witness of the fact that the Holy Ghost had come upon
the Gentiles in response to the simple preaching of faith in Jesus Christ. Barnabas stuck to
Paul on this point, that it was not necessary for the Gentiles to be bothered with the Law
as long as they believed in Christ.

Titus was superintendent of the churches in Crete, having been placed in charge of the churches
by Paul. Titus was a former Gentile.

  VERSE 2. And I went up by revelation.

If God had not ordered Paul to Jerusalem, Paul would never have gone there.

  VERSE 2. And communicated unto them that gospel.

After an absence of fourteen years, respectively eighteen years, Paul returned to Jerusalem
to confer with the other apostles.

  VERSE 2. Which I preach among the Gentiles.

Among the Jews Paul allowed Law and circumcision to stand for the time being. So did all the
apostles. Nevertheless Paul held fast to the liberty of the Gospel.

Paul admits that he conferred with the apostles concerning his Gospel. But he denies that the
conference benefited or taught him anything. The fact is he resisted those who wanted to force
the practice of the Law upon the Gentiles. They did not overcome him, he overcame them. "Your
false apostles lie, when they say that I circumcised Timothy, shaved my head in Cenchrea, and
went up to Jerusalem, at the request of the apostles. I went to Jerusalem at the request of
God. What is more, I won the indorsement of the apostles. My opponents lost out."

The matter upon which the apostles deliberated in conference was this: Is the observance of
the Law requisite unto justification? Paul answered: "I have preached faith in Christ to the
Gentiles, and not the Law. If the Jews want to keep the Law and be circumcised, very well,
as long as they do so from a right motive."

  VERSE 2. But privately to them which were of reputation.

This is to say, "I conferred not only with the brethren, but with the leaders among them."

  VERSE 2. Lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

Not that Paul himself ever thought he had run in vain. However, many did think that Paul had
preached the Gospel in vain, because he kept the Gentiles free from the yoke of the Law. The
opinion that obedience to the Law was mandatory unto salvation was gaining ground. Paul meant
to remedy this evil. By this conference he hoped to establish the identity of his Gospel with
that of the other apostles, to stop the talk of his opponents that he had been running around
in vain.

  VERSE 3. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
  compelled to be circumcised.

The word "compelled" acquaints us with the outcome of the conference. It was resolved that
the Gentiles should not be compelled to be circumcised.

Paul did not condemn circumcision in itself. Neither by word nor deed did he ever inveigh against
circumcision. But he did protest against circumcision being made a condition for salvation.
He cited the case of the Fathers. "The fathers were not justified by circumcision. It was to
them a sign and seal of righteousness. They looked upon circumcision as a confession of their
faith."

The believing Jews, however, could not get it through their heads that circumcision was not
necessary for salvation. They were encouraged in their wrong attitude by the false apostles.
The result was that the people were up in arms against Paul and his doctrine.

Paul did not condemn circumcision as if it were a sin to receive it. But he insisted, and the
conference upheld him, that circumcision had no bearing upon salvation and was therefore not
to be forced upon the Gentiles. The conference agreed that the Jews should be permitted to
keep their ancient customs for the time being, so long as they did not regard those customs
as conveying God's justification of the sinner.

The false apostles were dissatisfied with the verdict of the conference. They did not want
to rest circumcision and the practice of the Law in Christian liberty. They insisted that circumcision
was obligatory unto salvation.

As the opponents of Paul, so our own adversaries [Luther's, the enemies of the Reformation]
contend that the traditions of the Fathers dare not be neglected without loss of salvation.
Our opponents will not agree with us on anything. They defend their blasphemies. They go as
far to enforce them with the sword.

Paul's victory was complete. Titus, who was with Paul, was not compelled to be circumcised,
although he stood in the midst of the apostles when this question of circumcision was debated.
This was a blow to the false apostles. With the living fact that Titus was not compelled to
be circumcised Paul was able to squelch his adversaries.

  VERSES 4,5.

Paul here explains his motive for going up to Jerusalem. He did not go to Jerusalem to be instructed
or confirmed in his Gospel by the other apostles. He went to Jerusalem in order to preserve
the true Gospel for the Galatian churches and for all the churches of the Gentiles.

When Paul speaks of the truth of the Gospel he implies by contrast a false gospel. The false
apostles also had a gospel, but it was an untrue gospel. "In holding out against them," says
Paul, "I conserved the truth of the pure Gospel."

Now the true Gospel has it that we are justified by faith alone, without the deeds of the Law.
The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but not without the deeds of the Law.
The false apostles preached a conditional gospel.

So do the papists. They admit that faith is the foundation of salvation. But they add the conditional
clause that faith can save only when it is furnished with good works. This is wrong. The true
Gospel declares that good works are the embellishment of faith, but that faith itself is the
gift and work of God in our hearts. Faith is able to justify, because it apprehends Christ,
the Redeemer.

Human reason can think only in terms of the Law. It mumbles: "This I have done, this I have
not done." But faith looks to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, given into death for the sins of
the whole world. To turn one's eyes away from Jesus means to turn them to the Law.

True faith lays hold of Christ and leans on Him alone. Our opponents cannot understand this.
In their blindness they cast away the precious pearl, Christ, and hang onto their stubborn
works. They have no idea what faith is. How can they teach faith to others?

Not satisfied with teaching an untrue gospel, the false apostles tried to entangle Paul.

When Paul saw through their scheme, he attacked the false apostles. He says, "We did not let
go of the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus. We routed them by the judgment of the apostles,
and we would not give in to them, no, not an inch."

We too were willing to make all kinds of concessions to the papists. Yes, we are willing to
offer them more than we should. But we will not give up the liberty of conscience which we
have in Christ Jesus. We refuse to have our conscience bound by any work or law, so that by
doing this or that we should be righteous, or leaving this or that undone we should be damned.

Since our opponents will not let it stand that only faith in Christ justifies, we will not
yield to them. On the question of justification we must remain adamant, or else we shall lose
the truth of the Gospel. It is a matter of life and death. It involves the death of the Son
of God, who died for the sins of the world. If we surrender faith in Christ, as the only thing
that can justify us, the death and resurrection of Jesus are without meaning; that Christ is
the Savior of the world would be a myth. God would be a liar, because He would not have fulfilled
His promises. Our stubbornness is right, because we want to preserve the liberty which we have
in Christ. Only by preserving our liberty shall we be able to retain the truth of the Gospel
inviolate.

Some will object that the Law is divine and holy. Let it be divine and holy. The Law has no
right to tell me that I must be justified by it. The Law has the right to tell me that I should
love God and my neighbor, that I should live in chastity, temperance, patience, etc. The Law
has no right to tell me how I may be delivered from sin, death, and hell. It is the Gospel's
business to tell me that. I must listen to the Gospel. It tells me, not what I must do, but
what Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has done for me.

To conclude, Paul refused to circumcise Titus for the reason that the false apostles wanted
to compel him to circumcise Titus. Paul refused to accede to their demands. If they had asked
it on the plea of brotherly love, Paul would not have denied them. But because they demanded
it on the ground that it was necessary for salvation, Paul defied them, and prevailed. Titus
was not circumcised.

  VERSE 6. But of those who seemed to be somewhat, whatsoever they
  were, it maketh no matter to me.

This is a good point in Paul's refutation. Paul disparages the authority and dignity of the
true apostles. He says of them, "Which seemed to be somewhat." The authority of the apostles
was indeed great in all the churches. Paul did not want to detract from their authority, but
he had to speak disparagingly of their authority in order to conserve the truth of the Gospel,
and the liberty of conscience.

The false apostles used this argument against Paul: "The apostles lived with Christ for three
years. They heard His sermons. They witnessed His miracles. They themselves preached and performed
miracles while Christ was on earth. Paul never saw Jesus in the flesh. Now, whom ought you
to believe: Paul, who stands alone, a mere disciple of the apostles, one of the last and least;
or will you believe those grand apostles who were sent and confirmed by Christ Himself long
before Paul?"

What could Paul say to that? He answered: "What they say has no bearing on the argument. If
the apostles were angels from heaven, that would not impress me. We are not now discussing
the excellency of the apostles. We are talking about the Word of God now, and the truth of
the Gospel. That Gospel is more excellent than all apostles.

  VERSE 6. God accepteth no man's person.

Paul is quoting Moses: "Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person
of the mighty." (Lev. 19:15) This quotation from Moses ought to shut the mouths of the false
apostles. "Don't you know that God is no respecter of persons?" cries Paul. The dignity or
authority of men means nothing to God. The fact is that God often rejects just such who stand
in the odor of sanctity and in the aura of importance. In doing so God seems unjust and harsh.
But men need deterring examples. For it is a vice with us to esteem personality more highly
than the Word of God. God wants us to exalt His Word and not men.

There must be people in high office, of course. But we are not to deify them. The governor,
the mayor, the preacher, the teacher, the scholar, father, mother, are persons whom we are
to love and revere, but not to the extent that we forget God. Least we attach too much importance
to the person, God leaves with important persons offenses and sins, sometimes astounding shortcomings,
to show us that there is a lot of difference between any person and God. David was a good king.
But when the people began to think too well of him, down he fell into horrible sins, adultery
and murder. Peter, excellent apostle that he was, denied Christ. Such examples of which the
Scriptures are full, ought to warn us not to repose our trust in men. In the papacy appearance
counts for everything. Indeed, the whole papacy amounts to nothing more than a mere kowtowing
of persons and outward mummery. But God alone is to be feared and honored.

I would honor the Pope, I would love his person, if he would leave my conscience alone, and
not compel me to sin against God. But the Pope wants to be adored himself, and that cannot
be done without offending God. Since we must choose between one or the other, let us choose
God. The truth is we are commissioned by God to resist the Pope, for it is written, "We ought
to obey God rather than men." (Acts 5:29)

We have seen how Paul refutes the argument of the false apostles concerning the authority of
the apostles. In order that the truth of the Gospel may continue; in order that the Word of
God and the righteousness of faith may be kept pure and undefiled, let the apostles, let an
angel from heaven, let Peter, let Paul, let them all perish.

  VERSE 6. For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added
  nothing to me.

The Apostle repeats: "I did not so confer with the apostles that they taught me anything. What
could they possibly teach me since Christ by His revelation had taught me all things? It was
but a conference, and no disputation. I learned nothing, neither did I defend my cause. I only
stated what I had done, that I had preached to the Gentiles faith in Christ, without the Law,
and that in response to my preaching the Holy Ghost came down upon the Gentiles. When the apostles
heard this, they were glad that I had taught the truth."

If Paul would not give in to the false apostles, much less ought we to give in to our opponents.
I know that a Christian should be humble, but against the Pope I am going to be proud and say
to him: "You, Pope, I will not have you for my boss, for I am sure that my doctrine is divine."
Such pride against the Pope is imperative, for if we are not stout and proud we shall never
succeed in defending the article of the righteousness of faith.

If the Pope would concede that God alone by His grace through Christ justifies sinners, we
would carry him in our arms, we would kiss his feet. But since we cannot obtain this concession,
we will give in to nobody, not to all the angels in heaven, not to Peter, not to Paul, not
to a hundred emperors, not to a thousand popes, not to the whole world. If in this matter we
were to humble ourselves, they would take from us the God who created us, and Jesus Christ
who has redeemed us by His blood. Let this be our resolution, that we will suffer the loss
of all things, the loss of our good name, of life itself, but the Gospel and our faith in Jesus
Christ--we will not stand for it that anybody take them from us.

  VERSES 7, 8. But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
  uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision
  was unto Peter; [For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the
  apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
  Gentiles.]

Here the Apostle claims for himself the same authority which the false apostles attributed
to the true apostles. Paul simply inverts their argument. "to bolster their evil cause," says
he, "the false apostles quote the authority of the great apostles against me. I can quote the
same authority against them, for the apostles are on my side. They gave me the right hand of
fellowship. They approved my ministry. O my Galatians, do not believe the counterfeit apostles!"

What does Paul mean by saying that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto him,
and that of the circumcision to Peter? Did not Paul preach to the Jews, while Peter preached
to the Gentiles also? Peter converted the Centurion. Paul's custom was to enter into the synagogues
of the Jews, there to preach the Gospel. Why then should he call himself the apostle of the
Gentiles, while he calls Peter the apostle of the circumcision?

Paul refers to the fact that the other apostles remained in Jerusalem until the destruction
of the city became imminent. But Paul was especially called the apostle of the Gentiles. Even
before the destruction of Jerusalem Jews dwelt here and there in the cities of the Gentiles.
Coming to a city, Paul customarily entered the synagogues of the Jews and first brought to
them as the children of the kingdom, the glad tidings that the promises made unto the fathers
were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. When the Jews refused to hear these glad tidings, Paul turned
to the Gentiles. He was the apostle of the Gentiles in a special sense, as Peter was the apostle
of the Jews.

Paul reiterates that Peter, James, and John, the accepted pillars of the Church, taught him
nothing, nor did they commit unto him the office of preaching the Gospel unto the Gentiles.
Both the knowledge of the Gospel and the commandment to preach it to the Gentiles, Paul received
directly from God. His case was parallel to that of Peter's, who was particularly commissioned
to preach the Gospel to the Jews.

The apostles had the same charge, the identical Gospel. Peter did not proclaim a different
Gospel, nor had he appointed his fellow apostles. They were equals. They were all taught of
God. None was greater than the other, none could point to prerogatives above the other. To
justify his usurped primacy in the Church the Pope claims that Peter was the chief of the apostles.
This is an impudent falsehood.

  VERSE 8. For he that wrought effectually in Peter.

With these words Paul refutes another argument of the false apostles. "What reason have the
false apostles to boast that the Gospel of Peter was mighty, that he converted many, that he
wrought great miracles, and that his very shadow healed the sick? These reports are true enough.
But where did Peter acquire this power? God gave him the power. I have the same power. I received
my power, not from Peter, but from the same God, the same Spirit who was mighty in Peter was
mighty in me also." Some secular writers put Paul's boasting down as carnal pride. But Paul
had no personal interest in his boasting. It was with him a matter of faith and doctrine. The
controversy was not about the glory of Paul, but the glory of God, the Word of God, the true
worship of God, true religion, and the righteousness of faith.

  VERSE 9. And when James, Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars,
  perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and
  Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the
  heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

"The fact is, when the apostles heard that I had received the charge to preach the Gospel to
the Gentiles from Christ; when they heard that God had wrought many miracles through me; that
great numbers of the Gentiles had come to the knowledge of Christ through my ministry; when
they heard that the Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost without Law and circumcision, by the
simple preaching of faith; when they heard all this they glorified God for His grace in me."
Hence, Paul was justified in concluding that the apostles were for him, and not against him.

  VERSE 9. The right hands of fellowship.

As if the apostles had said to him: "We, Paul, do agree with you in all things. We are companions
in doctrine. We have the same Gospel with this difference, that to you is committed the Gospel
for the uncircumcised, while the Gospel for the circumcision is committed unto us. But this
difference ought not to hinder our friendship, since we preach one and the same Gospel."

  VERSE 10. Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same
  which I also was forward to do.

Next to the preaching of the Gospel, a true and faithful pastor will take care of the poor.
Where the Church is, there must be the poor, for the world and the devil persecute the Church
and impoverish many faithful Christians.

Speaking of money, nobody wants to contribute nowadays to the maintenance of the ministry,
and the erection of schools. When it comes to establishing false worship and idolatry, no cost
is spared. True religion is ever in need of money, while false religions are backed by wealth.

  VERSE 11. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
  face, because he was to be blamed.

Paul goes on in his refutation of the false apostles by saying that in Antioch he withstood
Peter in the presence of the whole congregation. As he stated before, Paul had no small matter
in hand, but the chief article of the Christian religion. When this article is endangered,
we must not hesitate to resist Peter, or an angel from heaven. Paul paid no regard to the dignity
and position of Peter, when he saw this article in danger. It is written: "He that loveth father
or mother or his own life, more than me, is not worthy of me." (Matt. 10:37.)

For defending the truth in our day, we are called proud and obstinate hypocrites. We are not
ashamed of these titles. The cause we are called to defend, is not Peter's cause, or the cause
of our parents, or that of the government, or that of the world, but the cause of God. In defense
of that cause we must be firm and unyielding.

When he says, "to his face," Paul accuses the false apostles of slandering him behind his back.
In his presence they dared not to open their mouths. He tells them, "I did not speak evil of
Peter behind his back, but I withstood him frankly and openly."

Others may debate here whether an apostle might sin. I claim that we ought not to make Peter
out as faultless. Prophets have erred. Nathan told David that he should go ahead and build
the Temple of the Lord. But his prophecy was afterwards corrected by the Lord. The apostles
erred in thinking of the Kingdom of Christ as a worldly state. Peter had heard the command
of Christ, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature." But if it had
not been for the heavenly vision and the special command of Christ, Peter would never have
gone to the home of Cornelius. Peter also erred in this matter of circumcision. If Paul had
not publicly censured him, all the believing Gentiles would have been compelled to receive
circumcision and accept the Jewish law. We are not to attribute perfection to any man.

Luke reports "that the contention between Paul and Barnabas was so sharp that they departed
asunder one from the other." The cause of their disagreement could hardly have been small since
it separated these two, who had been joined together for years in a holy partnership. Such
incidents are recorded for our consolation. After all, it is a comfort to know that even saints
might and do sin.

Samson, David, and many other excellent men, fell into grievous sins. Job and Jeremiah cursed
the day of their birth. Elijah and Jonah became weary of life and prayed for death. Such offenses
on the part of the saints, the Scriptures record for the comfort of those who are near despair.
No person has ever sunk so low that he cannot rise again. On the other hand, no man's standing
is so secure that he may not fall. If Peter fell, I may fall. If he rose again, I may rise
again. We have the same gifts that they had, the same Christ, the same baptism and the same
Gospel, the same forgiveness of sins. They needed these saving ordinances just as much as we do.

  VERSE 12. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
  Gentiles.

The Gentiles who had been converted to faith in Christ, ate meats forbidden by the Law. Peter,
visiting some of these Gentiles, ate meat and drank wine with them, although he knew that these
things were forbidden in the Law. Paul declared that he did likewise, that he became as a Jew
to the Jews, and to them that were without law, as without law. He ate and drank with the Gentiles
unconcerned about the Jewish Law. When he was with the Jews, however, he abstained from all
things forbidden in the Law, for he labored to serve all men, that he "might by all means save
some." Paul does not reprove Peter for transgressing the Law, but for disguising his attitude
to the Law.

  VERSE 12. But when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
  fearing them which were of the circumcision.

Paul does not accuse Peter of malice or ignorance, but of lack of principle, in that he abstained
from meats, because he feared the Jews that came from James. Peter's weak attitude endangered
the principle of Christian liberty. It is the deduction rather than the fact which Paul reproves.
To eat and to drink, or not to eat and drink, is immaterial. But to make the deduction "If
you eat, you sin; if you abstain you are righteous"--this is wrong.

Meats may be refused for two reasons. First, they may be refused for the sake of Christian
love. There is no danger connected with a refusal of meats for the sake of charity. To bear
with the infirmity of a brother is a good thing. Paul himself taught and exemplified such thoughtfulness.
Secondly, meats may be refused in the mistaken hope of thereby obtaining righteousness. When
this is the purpose of abstaining from meats, we say, let charity go. To refrain from meats
for this latter reason amounts to a denial of Christ. If we must lose one or the other, let
us lose a friend and brother, rather than God, our Father.

Jerome, who understood not this passage, nor the whole epistle for that matter, excuses Peter's
action on the ground "that it was done in ignorance." But Peter offended by giving the impression
that he was indorsing the Law. By his example he encouraged Gentiles and Jews to forsake the
truth of the Gospel. If Paul had not reproved him, there would have been a sliding back of
Christians into the Jewish religion, and a return to the burdens of the Law.

It is surprising that Peter, excellent apostle that he was, should have been guilty of such
vacillation. In a former council at Jerusalem he practically stood alone in defense of the
truth that salvation is by faith, without the Law. Peter at that time valiantly defended the
liberty of the Gospel. But now by abstaining from meats forbidden in the Law, he went against
his better judgment. You have no idea what danger there is in customs and ceremonies. They
so easily tend to error in works.

  VERSE 13. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch
  that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

It is marvelous how God preserved the Church by one single person. Paul alone stood up for
the truth, for Barnabas, his companion, was lost to him, and Peter was against him. Sometimes
one lone person can do more in a conference than the whole assembly.

I mention this to urge all to learn how properly to differentiate between the Law and the Gospel,
in order to avoid dissembling. When it come to the article of justification we must not yield,
if we want to retain the truth of the Gospel.

When the conscience is disturbed, do not seek advice from reason or from the Law, but rest
your conscience in the grace of God and in His Word, and proceed as if you had never heard
of the Law. The Law has its place and its own good time. While Moses was in the mountain where
he talked with God face to face, he had no law, he made no law, he administered no law. But
when he came down from the mountain, he was a lawgiver. The conscience must be kept above the
Law, the body under the Law.

Paul reproved Peter for no trifle, but for the chief article of Christian doctrine, which Peter's
hypocrisy had endangered. For Barnabas and other Jews followed Peter's example. It is surprising
that such good men as Peter, Barnabas, and others should fall into unexpected error, especially
in a matter which they knew so well. To trust in our own strength, our own goodness, our own
wisdom, is a perilous thing. Let us search the Scriptures with humility, praying that we may
never lose the light of the Gospel. "Lord, increase our faith."

  VERSE 14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to
  the truth of the gospel.

No one except Paul had his eyes open. Consequently it was his duty to reprove Peter and his
followers for swerving from the truth of the Gospel. It was no easy task for Paul to reprimand
Peter. To the honor of Peter it must be said that he took the correction. No doubt, he freely
acknowledged his fault.

The person who can rightly divide Law and Gospel has reason to thank God. He is a true theologian.
I must confess that in times of temptation I do not always know how to do it. To divide Law
and Gospel means to place the Gospel in heaven, and to keep the Law on earth; to call the righteousness
of the Gospel heavenly, and the righteousness of the Law earthly; to put as much difference
between the righteousness of the Gospel and that of the Law, as there is difference between
day and night. If it is a question of faith or conscience, ignore the Law entirely. If it is
a question of works, then lift high the lantern of works and the righteousness of the Law.
If your conscience is oppressed with a sense of sin, talk to your conscience. Say: "You are
now groveling in the dirt. You are now a laboring ass. Go ahead, and carry your burden. But
why don't you mount up to heaven? There the Law cannot follow you!" Leave the ass burdened
with laws behind in the valley. But your conscience, let it ascend with Isaac into the mountain.

In civil life obedience to the law is severely required. In civil life Gospel, conscience,
grace, remission of sins, Christ Himself, do not count, but only Moses with the lawbooks. If
we bear in mind this distinction, neither Gospel nor Law shall trespass upon each other. The
moment Law and sin cross into heaven, i.e., your conscience, kick them out. On the other hand,
when grace wanders unto the earth, i.e., into the body, tell grace: "You have no business to
be around the dreg and dung of this bodily life. You belong in heaven."

By his compromising attitude Peter confused the separation of Law and Gospel. Paul had to do
something about it. He reproved Peter, not to embarrass him, but to conserve the difference
between the Gospel which justifies in heaven, and the Law which justifies on earth.

The right separation between Law and Gospel is very important to know. Christian doctrine is
impossible without it. Let all who love and fear God, diligently learn the difference, not
only in theory but also in practice.

When your conscience gets into trouble, say to yourself: "There is a time to die, and a time
to live; a time to learn the Law, and a time to unlearn the Law; a time to hear the Gospel,
and a time to ignore the Gospel. Let the Law now depart, and let the Gospel enter, for now
is the right time to hear the Gospel, and not the Law." However, when the conflict of conscience
is over and external duties must be performed, close your ears to the Gospel, and open them
wide to the Law.

  VERSE 14. I said unto Peter before them all, If thou being a Jew, livest
  after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest
  thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews

To live as a Jew is nothing bad. To eat or not to eat pork, what difference does it make? But
to play the Jew, and for conscience' sake to abstain from certain meats, is a denial of Christ.
When Paul saw that Peter's attitude tended to this, he withstood Peter and said to him: "You
know that the observance of the Iaw is not needed unto righteousness. You know that we are
justified by faith in Christ. You know that we may eat all kinds of meats. Yet by your example
you obligate the Gentiles to forsake Christ, and to return to the Law. You give them reason
to think that faith is not sufficient unto salvation."

Peter did not say so, but his example said quite plainly that the observance of the Law must
be added to faith in Christ, if men are to be saved. From Peter's example the Gentiles could
not help but draw the conclusion that the Law was necessary unto salvation. If this error had
been permitted to pass unchallenged, Christ would have lost out altogether.

The controversy involved the preservation of pure doctrine. In such a controversy Paul did
not mind if anybody took offense.

  VERSE 15. We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles.

"When we Jews compare ourselves with the Gentiles, we look pretty good. We have the Law, we
have good works. Our rectitude dates from our birth, because the Jewish religion is natural
to us. But all this does not make us righteous before God." Peter and the others lived up to
the requirements of the Law. They had circumcision, the covenant, the promises, the apostleship.
But because of these advantages they were not to think themselves righteous before God. None
of these prerogatives spell faith in Christ, which alone can justify a person. We do not mean
to imply that the Law is bad. We do not condemn the Law, circumcision, etc., for their failure
to justify us. Paul spoke disparagingly of these ordinances, because the false apostles asserted
that mankind is saved by them without faith. Paul could not let this assertion stand, for without
faith all things are deadly.

  VERSE 16. It would do you no good. A person simply is not justified
by the works of the Law.

The works of the Law, according to Paul, include the whole Law, judicial, ceremonial, moral.
Now, if the performance of the moral law cannot justify, how can circumcision justify, when
circumcision is part of the ceremonial law?

The demands of the Law may be fulfilled before and after justification. There were many excellent
men among the pagans of old, men who never heard of justification. They lived moral lives.
But that fact did not justify them. Peter, Paul, all Christians, live up to the Law. But that
fact does not justify them. "For I know nothing by myself," says Paul, "yet am I not hereby
justified." (I Cor. 4:4.)

The nefarious opinion of the papists, which attributes the merit of grace and the remission
of sins to works, must here be emphatically rejected. The papists say that a good work performed
before grace has been obtained, is able to secure grace for a person, because it is no more
than right that God should reward a good deed. When grace has already been obtained, any good
work deserves everlasting life as a due payment and reward for merit. For the first, God is
no debtor, they say; but because God is good and just, it is no more than right (they say)
that He should reward a good work by granting grace for the service. But when grace has already
been obtained, they continue, God is in the position of a debtor, and is in duty bound to reward
a good work with the gift of eternal life. This is the wicked teaching of the papacy.

Now, if I could perform any work acceptable to God and deserving of grace, and once having
obtained grace my good works would continue to earn for me the right and reward of eternal
life, why should I stand in need of the grace of God and the suffering and death of Christ?
Christ would be of no benefit to me. Christ's mercy would be of no use to me.

This shows how little insight the pope and the whole of his religious coterie have into spiritual
matters, and how little they concern themselves with the spiritual health of their forlorn
flocks. They cannot believe that the flesh is unable to think, speak, or do anything except
against God. If they could see evil rooted in the nature of man, they would never entertain
such silly dreams about man's merit or worthiness.

With Paul we absolutely deny the possibility of self merit. God never yet gave to any person
grace and everlasting life as a reward for merit. The opinions of the papists are the intellectual
pipe-dreams of idle pates, that serve no other purpose but to draw men away from the true worship
of God. The papacy is founded upon hallucinations.

The true way of salvation is this. First, a person must realize that he is a sinner, the kind
of a sinner who is congenitally unable to do any good thing. "Whatsoever is not of faith, is
sin." Those who seek to earn the grace of God by their own efforts are trying to please God
with sins. They mock God, and provoke His anger. The first step on the way to salvation is
to repent.

The second part is this. God sent His only-begotten Son into the world that we may live through
His merit. He was crucified and killed for us. By sacrificing His Son for us God revealed Himself
to us as a merciful Father who donates remission of sins, righteousness, and life everlasting
for Christ's sake. God hands out His gifts freely unto all men. That is the praise and glory
of His mercy.

The scholastics explain the way of salvation in this manner. When a person happens to perform
a good deed, God accepts it and as a reward for the good deed God pours charity into that person.
They call it "charity infused." This charity is supposed to remain in the heart. They get wild
when they are told that this quality of the heart cannot justify a person.

They also claim that we are able to love God by our own natural strength, to love God above
all things, at least to the extent that we deserve grace. And, say the scholastics, because
God is not satisfied with a literal performance of the Law, but expects us to fulfill the Law
according to the mind of the Lawgiver, therefore we must obtain from above a quality above
nature, a quality which they call "formal righteousness."

We say, faith apprehends Jesus Christ. Christian faith is not an inactive quality in the heart.
If it is true faith it will surely take Christ for its object. Christ, apprehended by faith
and dwelling in the heart, constitutes Christian righteousness, for which God gives eternal life.

In contrast to the doting dreams of the scholastics, we teach this: First a person must learn
to know himself from the Law. With the prophet he will then confess: "All have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God." And, "there is none that doeth good, no, not one." And, "against
thee, thee only, have I sinned."

Having been humbled by the Law, and having been brought to a right estimate of himself, a man
will repent. He finds out that he is so depraved, that no strength, no works, no merits of
his own will ever deliver him from his guilt. He will then understand the meaning of Paul's
words: "I am sold under sin"; and "they are all under sin."

At this state a person begins to lament: "Who is going to help me?" In due time comes the Word
of the Gospel, and says: "Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Believe in Jesus Christ who was
crucified for your sins. Remember, your sins have been imposed upon Christ."

In this way are we delivered from sin. In this way are we justified and made heirs of everlasting
life.

In order to have faith you must paint a true portrait of Christ. The scholastics caricature
Christ into a judge and tormentor. But Christ is no law giver. He is the Lifegiver. He is the
Forgiver of sins. You must believe that Christ might have atoned for the sins of the world
with one single drop of His blood. Instead, He shed His blood abundantly in order that He might
give abundant satisfaction for our sins.

Here let me say, that these three things, faith, Christ, and imputation of righteousness, are
to be joined together. Faith takes hold of Christ. God accounts this faith for righteousness.

This imputation of righteousness we need very much, because we are far from perfect. As long
as we have this body, sin will dwell in our flesh. Then, too, we sometimes drive away the Holy
Spirit; we fall into sin, like Peter, David, and other holy men. Nevertheless we may always
take recourse to this fact, "that our sins are covered," and that "God will not lay them to
our charge." Sin is not held against us for Christ's sake. Where Christ and faith are lacking,
there is no remission or covering of sins, but only condemnation.

After we have taught faith in Christ, we teach good works. "Since you have found Christ by
faith," we say, "begin now to work and do well. Love God and your neighbor. Call upon God,
give thanks unto Him, praise Him, confess Him. These are good works. Let them flow from a cheerful
heart, because you have remission of sin in Christ."

When crosses and afflictions come our way, we bear them patiently. "For Christ's yoke is easy,
and His burden is light." When sin has been pardoned, and the conscience has been eased of
its dreadful load, a Christian can endure all things in Christ.

To give a short definition of a Christian: A Christian is not somebody chalks sin, because
of his faith in Christ. This doctrine brings comfort to consciences in serious trouble. When
a person is a Christian he is above law and sin. When the Law accuses him, and sin wants to
drive the wits out of him, a Christian looks to Christ. A Christian is free. He has no master
except Christ. A Christian is greater than the whole world.

  VERSE 16. Even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
  justified.

The true way of becoming a Christian is to be justified by faith in Jesus Christ, and not by
the works of the Law.

We know that we must also teach good works, but they must be taught in their proper turn, when
the discussion is concerning works and not the article of justification.

Here the question arises by what means are we justified? We answer with Paul, "By faith only
in Christ are we pronounced righteous, and not by works." Not that we reject good works. Far
from it. But we will not allow ourselves to be removed from the anchorage of our salvation.

The Law is a good thing. But when the discussion is about justification, then is no time to
drag in the Law. When we discuss justification we ought to speak of Christ and the benefits
He has brought us.

Christ is no sheriff. That we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
  the works of the Law.

We do not mean to say that the Law is bad. Only it is not able to justify us. To be at peace
with God, we have need of a far better mediator than Moses or the Law. We must know that we
are nothing. We must understand that we are merely beneficiaries and recipients of the treasures
of Christ.

So far, the words of Paul were addressed to Peter. Now Paul turns to the Galatians and makes
this summary statement:

  VERSE 16. For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

By the term "flesh" Paul does not understand manifest vices. Such sins he usually calls by
their proper names, as adultery, fornication, etc. By "flesh" Paul understands what Jesus meant
in the third chapter of John, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh". (John 3:6.) "Flesh"
here means the whole nature of man, inclusive of reason and instincts. "This flesh," says Paul,
"is not justified by the works of the law."

The papists do not believe this. They say, "A person who performs this good deed or that, deserves
the forgiveness of his sins. A person who joins this or that holy order, has the promise of
everlasting life."

To me it is a miracle that the Church, so long surrounded by vicious sects, has been able to
survive at all. God must have been able to call a few who in their failure to discover any
good in themselves to cite against the wrath and judgment of God, simply took to the suffering
and death of Christ, and were saved by this simple faith.

Nevertheless God has punished the contempt of the Gospel and of Christ on the part of the papists,
by turning them over to a reprobatestate of mind in which they reject the Gospel, and receive
with gusto the abominable rules, ordinances, and traditions of men in preference to the Word
of God, until they went so far as to forbid marriage. God punished them justly, because they
blasphemed the only Son of God.

This is, then, our general conclusion: "By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."

  VERSE 17.

Either we are not justified by Christ, or we are not justified by the Law. The fact is, we
are justified by Christ. Hence, we are not justified by the Law. If we observe the Law in order
to be justified, or after having been justified by Christ, we think we must further be justified
by the Law, we convert Christ into a legislator and a minister of sin.

"What are these false apostles doing?" Paul cries. "They are turning Law into grace, and grace
into Law. They are changing Moses into Christ, and Christ into Moses. By teaching that besides
Christ and His righteousness the performance of the Law is necessary unto salvation, they put
the Law in the place of Christ, they attribute to the Law the power to save, a power that belongs
to Christ only." Christ is made to lose His good name, His office, and His glory, and is demoted
to the status of a law enforcer, reproving, terrifying, and chasing poor sinners around.

The proper office of Christ is to raise the sinner, and extricate him from his sins.

Papists and Anabaptists deride us because we so earnestly require faith. "Faith," they say,
"makes men reckless." What do these law-workers know about faith, when they are so busy calling
people back from baptism, from faith, from the promises of Christ to the Law?

With their doctrine these lying sects of perdition deface the benefits of Christ to this day.
They rob Christ of His glory as the Justifier of mankind and cast Him into the role of a minister
of sin. They are like the false apostles. There is not a single one among them who knows the
difference between law and grace.

We can tell the difference. We do not here and now argue whether we ought to do good works,
or whether the Law is any good, or whether the Law ought to be kept at all. We will discuss
these questions some other time. We are now concerned with justification. Our opponents refuse
to make this distinction. All they can do is to bellow that good works ought to be done. We
know that. We know that good works ought to be done, but we will talk about that when the proper
time comes. Now we are dealing with justification, and here good works should not be so much
as mentioned.

Paul's argument has often comforted me. He argues: "If we who have been justified by Christ
are counted unrighteous, why seek justification in Christ at all? If we are justified by the
Law, tell me, what has Christ achieved by His death, by His preaching, by His victory over
sin and death? Either we are justified by Christ, or we are made worse sinners by Him."

The Sacred Scriptures, particularly those of the New Testament, make frequent mention of faith
in Christ. "Whosoever believeth in him is saved, shall not perish, shall have everlasting life,
is not judged," etc. In open contradiction to the Scriptures, our opponents misquote, "He that
believeth in Christ is condemned, because he has faith without works." Our opponents turn everything
topsy-turvy. They make Christ over into a murderer, and Moses into a savior. Is not this horrible
blasphemy?

  VERSE 17. Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?

This is Hebrew phraseology, also used by Paul in II Corinthians, chapter 3. There Paul speaks
of two ministers: The minister of the letter, and the minister of the spirit; the minister
of the Law, and the minister of grace; the minister of death, and the minister of life. "Moses,"
says Paul, "is the minister of the Law, of sin, wrath, death, and condemnation."

Whoever teaches that good works are indispensable unto salvation, that to gain heaven a person
must suffer afflictions and follow the example of Christ and of the saints, is a minister of
the Law, of sin, wrath, and of death, for the conscience knows how impossible it is for a person
to fulfill the Law. Why, the Law makes trouble even for those who have the Holy Spirit. What
will not the Law do in the case of the wicked who do not even have the Holy Spirit?

The Law requires perfect obedience. It condemns all do not accomplish the will of God. But
show me a person who is able to render perfect obedience. The Law cannot justify. It can only
condemn according to the passage: "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which
are written in the book of the law to do them."

Paul has good reason for calling the minister of the Law the minister of sin, for the Law reveals
our sinfulness. The realization of sin in turn frightens the heart and drives it to despair.
Therefore all exponents of the Law and of works deserve to be called tyrants and oppressors.

The purpose of the Law is to reveal sin. That this is the purpose of the Law can be seen from
the account of the giving of the Law as reported in the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of
Exodus. Moses brought the people out of their tents to have God speak to them personally from
a cloud. But the people trembled with fear, fled, and standing aloof they begged Moses: "Speak
thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die." The proper office
of the Law is to lead us out of our tents, in other words, out of the security of our self-trust,
into the presence of God, that we may perceive His anger at our sinfulness.

All who say that faith alone in Christ does not justify a person, convert Christ into a minister
of sin, a teacher of the Law, and a cruel tyrant who requires the impossible. All merit-seekers
take Christ for a new lawgiver.

In conclusion, if the Law is the minister of sin, it is at the same time the minister of wrath
and death. As the Law reveals sin it fills a person with the fear of death and condemnation.
Eventually the conscience wakes up to the fact that God is angry. If God is angry with you,
He will destroy and condemn you forever. Unable to stand the thought of the wrath and judgment
of God, many a person commits suicide.

  VERSE 17. God forbid.

Christ is not the minister of sin, but the Dispenser of righteousness and the Giver of life.
Christ is Lord over law, sin and death. All who believe in Him are delivered from law, sin
and death.

The Law drives us away from God, but Christ reconciles God unto us, for "He is the Lamb of
God, that taketh away the sins of the world." Now if the sin of the world is taken away, it
is taken away from me. If sin is taken away, the wrath of God and His condemnation are also
taken away. Let us practice this blessed conviction.

  VERSE 18. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
  myself a transgressor.

"I have not preached to the end that I build again the things which I destroyed. If I should
do so, I would not only be laboring in vain, but I would make myself guilty of a great wrong.
By the ministry of the Gospel I have destroyed sin, heaviness of heart, wrath, and death. I
have abolished the Law, so that it should not bother your conscience any more. Should I now
once again establish the Law, and set up the rule of Moses? Of-- and wherefore? The run was not furnish

the death of Christ.

                                  CHAPTER 3

  VERSE 1. 0 foolish Galatians.

THE Apostle Paul manifests his apostolic care for the Galatians.

In the midst of his discourse on Christian righteousness Paul breaks off, and turns to address
the Galatians. "O foolish Galatians," he cries. "I have brought you the true Gospel, and you
received it with eagerness and gratitude. Now all of a sudden you drop the Gospel. What has
got into you?"

Paul reproves the Galatians rather sharply when he calls them "fools, bewitched, and disobedient."
Whether he is indignant or sorry, I cannot say. He may be both. It is the duty of a Christian
pastor to reprove the people committed to his charge. Of course, his anger must not flow from
malice, but from affection and a real zeal for Christ.

There is no question that Paul is disappointed. It hurts him to think that his Galatians showed
so little stability. We can hear him say: "I am sorry to hear of your troubles, and disappointed
in you for the disgraceful part you played." I say rather much on this point to save Paul from
the charge that he railed upon the churches, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel.

A certain distance and coolness can be noted in the title with which the Apostle addresses
the Galatians. He does not now address them as his brethren, as he usually does. He addresses
them as Galatians in order to remind them of their national trait to be foolish.

We have here an example of bad traits that often cling to individual Christians and entire
congregations. Grace does not suddenly transform a Christian into a new and perfect creature.
Dregs of the old and natural corruption remain. The Spirit of God cannot at once overcome human
deficiency. Sanctification takes time.

Although the Galatians had been enlightened by the Holy Spirit through the preaching of faith,
something of their national trait of foolishness plus their original depravity clung to them.
Let no man think that once he has received faith, he can presently be converted into a faultless
creature. The leavings of old vices will stick to him, be he ever so good a Christian.

  VERSE 1. Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth?

Paul calls the Galatians foolish and bewitched. In the fifth chapter he mentions sorcery among
the works of the flesh, declaring that witchcraft and sorcery are real manifestations and legitimate
activities of the devil. We are all exposed to the influence of the devil, because he is the
prince and god of the world in which we live.

Satan is clever. He does not only bewitch men in a crude manner, but also in a more artful
fashion. He bedevils the minds of men with hideous fallacies. Not only is he able to deceive
the self-assured, but even those who profess the true Christian faith. There is not one among
us who is not at times seduced by Satan into false beliefs.

This accounts for the many new battles we have to wage nowadays. But the attacks of the old
Serpent are not without profit to us, for they confirm our doctrine and strengthen our faith
in Christ. Many a time we were wrestled down in these conflicts with Satan, but Christ has
always triumphed and always will triumph. Do not think that the Galatians were the only ones
to be bewitched by the devil. Let us realize that we too may be seduced by Satan.

  VERSE 1. Who hath bewitched you?

In this sentence Paul excuses the Galatians, while he blames the false apostles for the apostasy
of the Galatians.

As if he were saying: "I know your defection was not willful. The devil sent the false apostles
to you, and they tallied you into believing that you are justified by the Law. With this our
epistle we endeavor to undo the damage which the false apostles have inflicted upon you."

Like Paul, we struggle with the Word of God against the fanatical Anabaptists of our day; and
our efforts are not entirely in vain. The trouble is there are many who refuse to be instructed.
They will not listen to reason; they will not listen to the Scriptures, because they are bewitched
by the tricky devil who can make a lie look like the truth.

Since the devil has this uncanny ability to make us believe a lie until we would swear a thousand
times it were the truth, we must not be proud, but walk in fear and humility, and call upon
the Lord Jesus to save us from temptation.

Although I am a doctor of divinity, and have preached Christ and fought His battles for a long
time, I know from personal experience how difficult it is to hold fast to the truth. I cannot
always shake off Satan. I cannot always apprehend Christ as the Scriptures portray Him. Sometimes
the devil distorts Christ to my vision. But thanks be to God, who keeps us in His Word, in
faith, and in prayer.

The spiritual witchery of the devil creates in the heart a wrong idea of Christ. Those who
share the opinion that a person is justified by the works of the Law, are simply bewitched.
Their belief goes against faith and Christ.

  VERSE 1. That ye should not obey the truth.

Paul incriminates the Galatians in worse failure. "You are so bewitched that you no longer
obey the truth. I fear many of you have strayed so far that you will never return to the truth."

The apostasy of the Galatians is a fine indorsement of the Law, all right. You may preach the
Law ever so fervently; if the preaching of the Gospel does not accompany it, the Law will never
produce true conversion and heartfelt repentance. We do not mean to say that the preaching
of the Law is without value, but it only serves to bring home to us the wrath of God. The Law
bows a person down. It takes the Gospel and the preaching of faith in Christ to raise and save
a person.

  VERSE 1. Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth.

Paul's increasing severity becomes apparent as he reminds the Galatians that they disobeyed
the truth in defiance of the vivid description he had given them of Christ. So vividly had
he described Christ to them that they could almost see and handle Him. As if Paul were to say:
"No artist with all his colors could have pictured Christ to you as vividly as I have pictured
Him to you by my preaching. Yet you permitted yourselves to be seduced to the extent that you
disobeyed the truth of Christ."

  VERSE 1. Crucifed among you.

"You have not only rejected the grace of God, you have shamefully crucified Christ among you."
Paul employs the same phraseology in Hebrews 6:6: "Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son
of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."

It should make any person afraid to hear Paul say that those who seek to be justified by the
Law, not only deny Christ, but also crucify Him anew. If those who seek to be justified by
the Law and its works are crucifiers of Christ, what are they, I like to know, who seek salvation
by the filthy rags of their own work-righteousness?

Can there be anything more horrible than the papacy, an alliance of people who crucify Christ
in themselves, in the Church, and in the hearts of the believers?

Of all the diseased and vicious doctrines of the papacy the worst is this: "If you want to
serve God you must earn your own remission of sins and everlasting life, and in addition help
others to obtain salvation by giving them the benefit of your extra work-holiness." Monks,
friars, and all the rest of them brag that besides the ordinary requirements common to all
Christians, they do the works of supererogation, i.e., the performance of more than is required.
This is certainly a fiendish illusion.

No wonder Paul employs such sharp language in his effort to recall the Galatians from the doctrine
of the false apostles. He says to them: "Don't you realize what you have done? You have crucified
Christ anew because you seek salvation by the Law."

True, Christ can no longer be crucified in person, but He is crucified in us when we reject
grace, faith, free remission of sins and endeavor to be justified by our own works, or by the
works of the Law.

The Apostle is incensed at the presumptuousness of any person who thinks he can perform the
Law of God to his own salvation. He charges that person with the atrocity of crucifying anew
the Son of God.

There is a touch of irony in these words of the Apostle. "Come on now, my smart Galatians,
you who all of a sudden have become doctors, while I seem to be your pupil: Received ye the
Holy Ghost by the works of the Law, or by the preaching of the Gospel?" This question gave
them something to think about, because their own experience contradicted them.

"You cannot say that you received the Holy Spirit by the Law. As long as you were servants
of the Law, you never received the Holy Ghost. Nobody ever heard of the Holy Ghost being given
to anybody, be he doctor or dunce, as a result of the preaching of the Law. In your own case,
you have not only learned the Law by heart, you have labored with all your might to perform
it. You most of all should have received the Holy Ghost by the Law, if that were possible.
You cannot show me that this ever happened. But as soon as the Gospel came your way, you received
the Holy Ghost by the simple hearing of faith, before you ever had a chance to do a single
good deed." (Acts 11:15.)

Try to appreciate the force of Paul's argument which is so often repeated in the Book of Acts.
That Book was written for the express purpose of verifying Paul's assertion, that the Holy
Ghost comes upon men, not in response to the preaching of the Law, but in response to the preaching
of the Gospel. When Peter preached Christ at the first Pentecost, the Holy Ghost fell upon
the hearers, "and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls." Cornelius
received the Holy Ghost while Peter was speaking of Christ. "The Holy Ghost fell on all of
them which heard the word." These are actual experiences that cannot very well be denied. When
Paul and Barnabas returned to Jerusalem and reported what they had been able to accomplish
among the Gentiles, the whole Church was astonished, particularly when it heard that the uncircumcised
Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost by the preaching of faith in Christ.

Now as God gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles without the Law by the simple preaching of the
Gospel, so He gave the Holy Ghost also to the Jews, without the Law, through faith alone. If
the righteousness of the Law were necessary unto salvation, the Holy Ghost would never have
come to the Gentiles, because they did not bother about the Law. Hence the Law does not justify,
but faith in Christ justifies.

How was it with Cornelius? Cornelius and his friends whom he had invited over to his house,
do nothing but sit and listen. Peter is doing the talking. They just sit and do nothing. The
Law is far removed from their thoughts. They burn no sacrifices. They are not at all interested
in circumcision. All they do is to sit and listen to Peter. Suddenly the Holy Ghost enters
their hearts. His presence is unmistakable, "for they spoke with tongues and magnified God."

Right here we have one more difference between the Law and the Gospel. The Law does not bring
on the Holy Ghost. The Gospel, however, brings on the gift of the Holy Ghost, because it is
the nature of the Gospel to convey good gifts. The Law and the Gospel are contrary ideas. They
have contrary functions and purposes. To endow the Law with any capacity to produce righteousness
is to plagiarize the Gospel. The Gospel brings donations. It pleads for open hands to take
what is being offered. The Law has nothing to give. It demands, and its demands are impossible.

Our opponents come back at us with Cornelius. Because of these qualifications, he merited the
forgiveness of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. So reason our opponents.

  I answer: Cornelius was a Gentile. You cannot deny it. As a Gentile he
  was uncircumcised. As a Gentile he did not observe the Law. He never
  gave the Law any thought. For all that, he was justified and received
  the Holy Ghost. How can the Law avail anything unto righteousness?
Our opponents are not satisfied. They reply: "Granted that Cornelius was a
Gentile and did not receive the Holy Ghost by the Law, yet the text plainly
states that he was a devout man who feared God, gave alms, and prayed. Don't
you think he deserved the gift of the Holy Ghost?"

  I answer: Cornelius had the faith of the fathers who were saved by
  faith in the Christ to come. If Cornelius had died before Christ, he
  would have been saved because he believed in the Christ to come. But
  because the Messiah had already come, Cornelius had to be apprized of
  the fact. Since Christ has come we cannot be saved by faith in the
  Christ to come, but we must believe that he has come. The object of
  Peter's visit was to acquaint Cornelius with the fact that Christ was
  no longer to be looked for, because He is here.

As to the contention of our opponents that Cornelius deserved grace and the gift of the Holy
Ghost, because he was devout and just, we say that these attributes are the characteristics
of a spiritual person who already has faith in Christ, and not the characteristics of a Gentile
or of natural man. Luke first praises Cornelius for being a devout and God-fearing man, and
then Luke mentions the good works, the alms and prayers of Cornelius. Our opponents ignore
the sequence of Luke's words. They pounce on this one sentence, "which gave much alms to the
people," because it serves their assertion that merit precedes grace. The fact is that Cornelius
gave alms and prayed to God because he had faith. And because of his faith in the Christ to
come, Peter was delegated to preach unto Cornelius faith in the Christ who had already come.
This argument is convincing enough. Cornelius was justified without the Law, therefore the
Law cannot justify.

Take the case of Naaman, the Syrian, who was a Gentile and did not belong to the race of Moses.
Yet his flesh was cleansed, the God of Israel was revealed unto him, and he received the Holy
Ghost. Naaman confessed his faith: "Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth,
but in Israel." (II Kings 5:15.) Naaman does not do a thing. He does not busy himself with
the Law. He was never circumcised. That does not mean that his faith was inactive. What did
the Prophet tell him?" Go in peace." The Jews do not like to hear the prophet say this. "What,"
they exclaim, "should this heathen be justified without the Law? Should he be made equal to
us who are circumcised?"

Long before the time of Moses, God justified men without the Law. He justified many kings of
Egypt and Babylonia. He justified Job. Nineveh, that great city, was justified and received
the promise of God that He would not destroy the city. Why was Nineveh spared? Not because
it fulfilled the Law, but because Nineveh believed the word of God. They repented. Nowhere
in the Book of Jonah do you read that the Ninevites received the Law of Moses, or that they
were circumcised, or that they offered sacrifices.

All this happened long before Christ was born. If the Gentiles were justified without the Law
and quietly received the Holy Spirit at a time when the Law was in full force, why should the
Law count unto righteousness now, now that Christ has fulfilled the Law?

And yet many devote much time and labor to the Law, to the decrees of the fathers, and to the
traditions of the Pope. Many of these specialists have incapacitated themselves for any kind
of work, good or bad, by their rigorous attention to rules and laws. All the same, they could
not obtain a quiet conscience and peace in Christ. But the moment the Gospel of Christ touches
them, certainty comes to them, and joy, and a right judgment.

I have good reason for enlarging upon this point. The heart of man finds it difficult to believe
that so great a treasure as the Holy Ghost is gotten by the mere hearing of faith. The hearer
likes to reason like this: Forgiveness of sins, deliverance from death, the gift of the Holy
Ghost, everlasting life are grand things. If you want to obtain these priceless benefits, you
must engage in correspondingly great efforts. And the devil says, "Amen."

We must learn that forgiveness of sins, Christ, and the Holy Ghost, are freely granted unto
us at the preaching of faith, in spite of our sinfulness. We are not to waste time thinking
how unworthy we are of the blessings of God. We are to know that it pleased God freely to give
us His unspeakable gifts. If He offers His gifts free of charge, why not take them? Why worry
about our lack of worthiness? Why not accept gifts with joy and thanksgiving?

Right away foolish reason is once more offended. It scolds us. "When you say that a person
can do nothing to obtain the grace of God, you foster carnal security. People become shiftless
and will do no good at all. Better not preach this doctrine of faith. Rather urge the people
to exert and to exercise themselves in good works, so that the Holy Ghost will feel like coming
to them."

What did Jesus say to Martha when she was very "careful and troubled about many things" and
could hardly stand to see her sister Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus, just listening? A person
becomes a Christian not by working, but by hearing. The first step to being a Christian is
to hear the Gospel. When a person has accepted the Gospel, let him first give thanks unto God
with a glad heart, and then let him get busy on the good works to strive for, works that really
please God, and not man-made and self-chosen works.

Our opponents regard faith as an easy thing, but I know from personal experience how hard it
is to believe. That the Holy Ghost is received by faith, is quickly said, but not so quickly done.

All believers experience this difficulty. They would gladly embrace the Word with a full faith,
but the flesh deters them. You see, our reason always thinks it is too easy and cheap to have
righteousness, the Holy Spirit, and life everlasting by the mere hearing of the Gospel

  VERSE 3.

Paul now begins to warn the Galatians against a twofold danger. The first danger is: "Are ye
so foolish, that after ye have begun in the Spirit, ye would now end in the flesh?"

"Flesh" stands for the righteousness of reason which seeks justification by the accomplishment
of the Law. I am told that I began in the spirit under the papacy, but am ending up in the
flesh because I got married. As though single life were a spiritual life, and married life
a carnal life. They are silly. All the duties of a Christian husband, e.g., to love his wife,
to bring up his children, to govern his family, etc., are the very fruits of the Spirit.

The righteousness of the Law which Paul also terms the righteousness of the flesh is so far
from justifying a person that those who once had the Holy Spirit and lost Him, end up in the
Law to their complete destruction.

  VERSE 4. Have ye suffered so many things in vain?

The other danger against which the Apostle warns the Galatians is this: "Have ye suffered so
many things in vain?" Paul wants to say: "Consider not only the good start you had and lost,
but consider also the many things you have suffered for the sake of the Gospel and for the
name of Christ. You have suffered the loss of your possessions, you have borne reproaches,
you have passed through many dangers of body and life. You endured much for the name of Christ
and you endured it faithfully. But now you have lost everything, the Gospel, faith, and the
spiritual benefit of your sufferings for Christ's sake. What a miserable thing to endure so
many amictions for nothing."

  VERSE 4. If it be yet in vain.

The Apostle adds the afterthought: "If it be yet in vain. I do not despair of all hope for
you. But if you continue to look to the Law for righteousness, I think you should be told that
all your past true worship of God and all the afflictions that you have endured for Christ's
sake are going to help you not at all. I do not mean to discourage you altogether. I do hope
you will repent and amend."

  VERSE 5. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
  miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the
  hearing of faith?

This argument based on the experience of the Galatians, pleased the Apostle so well that he
returns to it after he had warned them against their twofold danger. "You have not only received
the Spirit by the preaching of the Gospel, but by the same Gospel you were enabled to do things."
"What things?" we ask. Miracles. At least the Galatians had manifested the striking fruits
of faith which true disciples of the Gospel manifested in those days. On one occasion the Apostle
wrote: "The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power." This "power" revealed itself not
only in readiness of speech, but in demonstrations of the supernatural ability of the Holy Spirit.

When the Gospel is preached unto faith, hope, love, and patience, God gives His wonder-working
Spirit. Paul reminds the Galatians of this. "God had not only brought you to faith by my preaching.
He had also sanctified you to bring forth the fruits of faith. And one of the fruits of your
faith was that you loved me so devotedly that you were willing to pluck out your eyes for me."
To love a fellow-man so devotedly as to be ready to bestow upon him money, goods, eyes in order
to secure his salvation, such love is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.

"These products of the Spirit you enjoyed before the false apostles misled you," the Apostle
reminds the Galatians. "But you haven't manifested any of these fruits under the regime of
the Law. How does it come that you do not grow the same fruits now? You no longer teach truly;
you do not believe boldly; you do not live well; you do not work hard; you do not bear things
patiently. Who has spoiled you that you no longer love me; that you are not now ready to pluck
out your eyes for me? What has happened to cool your personal interest in me?"

The same thing happened to me. When I began to proclaim the Gospel, there were many, very many
who were delighted with our doctrine and had a good opinion of us. And now? Now they have succeeded
in making us so odious to those who formerly loved us that they now hate us like poison.

Paul argues: "Your experience ought to teach you that the fruits of love do not grow on the
stump of the Law. You had not virtue prior to the preaching of the Gospel and you have no virtues
now under the regime of the false apostles."

We, too, may say to those who misname themselves "evangelical" and flout their new-found liberty:
Have you put down the tyranny of the Pope and obtained liberty in Christ through the Anabaptists
and other fanatics? Or have you obtained your freedom from us who preach faith in Christ Jesus?
If there is any honesty left in them they will have to confess that their freedom dates from
the preaching of the Gospel.

  VERSE 6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him
  for righteousness.

The Apostle next adduces the example of Abraham and reviews the testimony of the Scriptures
concerning faith. The first passage is taken from Genesis 16:6: "And he believed in the Lord;
and he counted it to him for righteousness." The Apostle makes the most of this passage. Abraham
may have enjoyed a good standing with men for his upright life, but not with God. In the sight
of God, Abraham was a condemned sinner. That he was justified before God was not due to his
own exertions, but due to his faith. The Scriptures expressly state: "Abraham believed in the
Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."

Paul places the emphasis upon the two words: Abraham believed. Faith in God constitutes the
highest worship, the prime duty, the first obedience, and the foremost sacrifice. Without faith
God forfeits His glory, wisdom, truth, and mercy in us. The first duty of man is to believe
in God and to honor Him with his faith. Faith is truly the height of wisdom, the right kind
of righteousness, the only real religion. This will give us an idea of the excellence of faith.

To believe in God as Abraham did is to be right with God because faith honors God. Faith says
to God: "I believe what you say." When we pay attention to reason, God seems to propose impossible
matters in the Christian Creed. To reason it seems absurd that Christ should offer His body
and blood in the Lord's Supper; that Baptism should be the washing of regeneration; that the
dead shall rise; that Christ the Son of God was conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary, etc.
Reason shouts that all this is preposterous. Are you surprised that reason thinks little of
faith? Reason thinks it ludicrous that faith should be the foremost service any person can
render unto God.

Let your faith supplant reason. Abraham mastered reason by faith in the Word of God. Not as
though reason ever yields meekly. It put up a fight against the faith of Abraham. Reason protested
that it was absurd to think that Sarah who was ninety years old and barren by nature, should
give birth to a son. But faith won the victory and routed reason, that ugly beast and enemy
of God. Everyone who by faith slays reason, the world's biggest monster, renders God a real
service, a better service than the religions of all races and all the drudgery of meritorious
monks can render.

Men fast, pray, watch, suffer. They intend to appease the wrath of God and to deserve God's
grace by their exertions. But there is no glory in it for God, because by their exertions these
workers pronounce God an unmerciful slave driver, an unfaithful and angry Judge. They despise
God, make a liar out of Him, snub Christ and all His benefits; in short they pull God from
His throne and perch themselves on it.

Faith truly honors God. And because faith honors God, God counts faith for righteousness.

Christian righteousness is the confidence of the heart in God through Christ Jesus. Such confidence
is accounted righteousness for Christ's sake. Two things make for Christian righteousness:
Faith in Christ, which is a gift of God; and God's acceptance of this imperfect faith of ours
for perfect righteousness. Because of my faith in Christ, God overlooks my distrust, the unwillingness
of my spirit, my many other sins. Because the shadow of Christ's wing covers me I have no fear
that God will cover all my sins and take my imperfections for perfect righteousness.

God "winks" at my sins and covers them up. God says: "Because you believe in My Son I will
forgive your sins until death shall deliver you from the body of sin."

Learn to understand the constitution of your Christian righteousness. Faith is weak, but it
means enough to God that He will not lay sin to our charge. He will not punish nor condemn
us for it. He will forgive our sins as though they amount to nothing at all. He will do it
not because we are worthy of such mercy. He will do it for Jesus' sake in whom we believe.

Paradoxically, a Christian is both right and wrong, holy and profane, an enemy of God and a
child of God. These contradictions no person can harmonize who does not understand the true
way of salvation. Under the papacy we were told to toil until the feeling of guilt had left
us. But the authors of this deranged idea were frequently driven to despair in the hour of
death. It would have happened to me, if Christ had not mercifully delivered me from this error.

We comfort the afflicted sinner in this manner: Brother, you can never be perfect in this life,
but you can be holy. He will say: "How can I be holy when I feel my sins?" I answer: You feel
sin? That is a good sign. To realize that one is ill is a step, and a very necessary step,
toward recovery. "But how will I get rid of my sin?" he will ask. I answer: See the heavenly
Physician, Christ, who heals the broken-hearted. Do not consult that Quackdoctor, Reason. Believe
in Christ and your sins will be pardoned. His righteousness will become your righteousness,
and your sins will become His sins.

On one occasion Jesus said to His disciples: "The Father loveth you." Why? Not because the
disciples were Pharisees, or circumcised, or particularly attentive to the Law. Jesus said:
"The Father loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
It pleased you to know that the Father sent me into the world. And because you believed it
the Father loves you." On another occasion Jesus called His disciples evil and commanded them
to ask for forgiveness.

A Christian is beloved of God and a sinner. How can these two contradictions be harmonized:
I am a sinner and deserve God's wrath and punishment, and yet the Father loves me? Christ alone
can harmonize these contradictions. He is the Mediator.

Do you now see how faith justifies without works? Sin lingers in us, and God hates sin. A transfusion
of righteousness therefore becomes vitally necessary. This transfusion of righteousness we
obtain from Christ because we believe in Him.

  VERSE 7. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
  the children of Abraham.

This is the main point of Paul's argument against the Jews: The children of Abraham are those
who believe and not those who are born of Abraham's flesh and blood. This point Paul drives
home with all his might because the Jews attached saving value to the genealogical fact: "We
are the seed and children of Abraham."

Let us begin with Abraham and learn how this friend of God was justified and saved. Not because
he left his country, his relatives, his father's house; not because he was circumcised; not
because he stood ready to sacrifice his own son Isaac in whom he had the promise of posterity.
Abraham was justified because he believed. Paul's argumentation runs like this: "Since this
is the unmistakable testimony of Holy Writ, why do you take your stand upon circumcision and
the Law? Was not Abraham, your father, of whom you make so much, justified and saved without
circumcision and the Law by faith alone?" Paul therefore concludes: "They which are of faith,
the same are the children of Abraham."

Abraham was the father of the faithful. In order to be a child of the believing Abraham you
must believe as he did. Otherwise you are merely the physical offspring of the procreating
Abraham, i.e., you were conceived and born in sin unto wrath and condemnation.

Ishmael and Isaac were both the natural children of Abraham. By rights Ishmael should have
enjoyed the prerogatives of the firstborn, if physical generation had any special value. Nevertheless
he was left out in the cold while Isaac was called. This goes to prove that the children of
faith are the real children of Abraham.

Some find fault with Paul for applying the term "faith" in Genesis 15:6 to Christ. They think
Paul's use of the term too wide and general. They think its meaning should be restricted to
the context. They claim Abraham's faith had no more in it than a belief in the promise of God
that he should have seed.

We reply: Faith presupposes the assurance of God's mercy. This assurance takes in the confidence
that our sins are forgiven for Christ's sake. Never will the conscience trust in God unless
it can be sure of God's mercy and promises in Christ. The faith of the fathers in the Old Testament
era, and our faith in the New Testament are one and the same faith in Christ Jesus, although
times and conditions may differ. Peter acknowledged this in the words: "Which neither our fathers
nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we
shall be saved, even as they." (I Cor. 10 :4.) And Christ Himself declared: "Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it and was glad." (John 8:56.) The faith of the fathers
was directed at the Christ who was to come, while ours rests in the Christ who has come. Time
does not change the object of true faith, or the Holy Spirit. There has always been and always
will be one mind, one impression, one faith concerning Christ among true believers whether
they live in times past, now, or in times to come. We too believe in the Christ to come as
the fathers did in the Old Testament, for we look for Christ to come again on the last day
to judge the quick and the dead.

  VERSE 7. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
  the children of Abraham.

Paul is saying: "You know from the example of Abraham and from the plain testimony of the Scriptures
that they are the children of Abraham, who have faith in Christ, regardless of their nationality,
regardless of the Law, regardless of works, regardless of their parentage. The promise was
made unto Abraham, 'Thou shalt be a father of many nations'; again, 'And in thee shall all
families of the earth be blessed."' To prevent the Jews from misinterpreting the word "nations,"
the Scriptures are careful to say "many nations." The true children of Abraham are the believers
in Christ from all nations.

  VERSE 8. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
  heathen through faith.

"Your boasting does not get you anywhere," says Paul to the Galatians, "because the Sacred
Scriptures foresaw and foretold long before the Law was ever given, that the heathen should
be justified by the blessed 'seed' of Abraham and not by the Law. This promise was made four
hundred and thirty years before the Law was given. Because the Law was given so many years
after Abraham, it could not abolish the promised blessing." This argument is strong because
it is based on the exact factor of time. "Why should you boast of the Law, my Galatians, when
the Law came four hundred and thirty years after the promise ?"

The false apostles glorified the Law and despised the promise made unto Abraham, although it
antedated the Law by many years. It was after Abraham was accounted righteous because of his
faith that the Scriptures first make mention of circumcision. "The Scriptures," says Paul,
"meant to forestall your infatuation for the righteousness of the Law by installing the righteousness
of faith before circumcision and the Law ever were ordained."

  VERSE 8. Preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall
  all nations be blessed.

The Jews misconstrue this passage. They want the term "to bless" to mean "to praise." They
want the passage to read: In thee shall all the nations of the earth be praised. But this is
a perversion of the words of Holy Writ. With the words "Abraham believed" Paul describes a
spiritual Abraham, renewed by faith and regenerated by the Holy Ghost, that he should be the
spiritual father of many nations. In that way all the Gentiles could be given to him for an
inheritance.

The Scriptures ascribe no righteousness to Abraham except through faith. The Scriptures speak
of Abraham as he stands before God, a man justified by faith. Because of his faith God extends
to him the promise: "In thee shall all nations be blessed."

  VERSE 9. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
  Abraham.

The emphasis lies on the words "with faithful Abraham." Paul distinguishes between Abraham
and Abraham. There is a working and there is a believing Abraham. With the working Abraham
we have nothing to do. Let the Jews glory in the generating Abraham; we glory in the believing
Abraham of whom the Scriptures say that he received the blessing of righteousness by faith,
not only for himself but for all who believe as he did. The world was promised to Abraham because
he believed. The whole world is blessed if it believes as Abraham believed.

The blessing is the promise of the Gospel. That all nations are to be blessed means that all
nations are to hear the Gospel. All nations are to be declared righteous before God through
faith in Christ Jesus. To bless simply means to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ's salvation.
This is the office of the New Testament Church which distributes the promised blessing by preaching
the Gospel, by administering the sacraments, by comforting the broken- hearted, in short, by
dispensing the benefits of Christ.

The Jews exhibited a working Abraham. The Pope exhibits a working Christ, or an exemplary Christ.
The Pope quotes Christ's saying recorded in John 13:15, "I have given you an example, that
ye should do as I have done to you." We do not deny that Christians ought to imitate the example
of Christ; but mere imitation will not satisfy God. And bear in mind that Paul is not now discussing
the example of Christ, but the salvation of Christ. That Abraham submitted to circumcision
at the command of God, that he was endowed with excellent virtues, that he obeyed God in all
things, was certainly admirable of him. To follow the example of Christ, to love one's neighbor,
to do good to them that persecute you, to pray for one's enemies, patiently to bear the ingratitude
of those who return evil for good, is certainly praiseworthy. But praiseworthy or not, such
virtues do not acquit us before God. It takes more than that to make us righteous before God.
We need Christ Himself, not His example, to save us. We need a redeeming, not an exemplary
Christ, to save us. Paul is here speaking of the redeeming Christ and the believing Abraham,
not of the model Christ or the sweating Abraham.

The believing Abraham is not to lie buried in the grave. He is to be dusted off and brought
out before the world. He is to be praised to the sky for his faith. Heaven and earth ought
to know about him and about his faith in Christ. The working Abraham ought to look pretty small
next to the believing Abraham.

Paul's words contain the implication of contrast. When he quotes Scripture to the effect that
all nations that share the faith of faithful Abraham are to be blessed, Paul means to imply
the contrast that all nations are accursed without faith in Christ.

  VERSE 10. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
  curse.

The curse of God is like a flood that swallows everything that is not of faith. To avoid the
curse we must hold on to the promise of the blessing in Christ.

The reader is reminded that all this has no bearing upon civil laws, customs, or political
matters. Civil laws and ordinances have their place and purpose. Let every government enact
the best possible laws. But civil

righteousness will never deliver a person from the condemnation of God's Law.

I have good reason for calling your attention to this. People easily mistake civil righteousness
for spiritual righteousness. In civil life we must, of course, pay attention to laws and deeds,
but in the spiritual life we must not think to be justified by laws and works, but always keep
in mind the promise and blessing of Christ, our only Savior.

According to Paul everything that is not of faith is sin. When our opponents hear us repeat
this statement of Paul, they make it appear as if we taught that governments should not be
honored, as if we favored rebellion against the constituted authorities, as if we condemned
all laws. Our opponents do us a great wrong, for we make a clear-cut distinction between civil
and spiritual affairs.

Governmental laws and ordinances are blessings of God for this life only. As for everlasting
life, temporal blessings are not good enough. Unbelievers enjoy more temporal blessings than
the Christians. Civil or legal righteousness may be good enough for this life but not for the
life hereafter. Otherwise the infidels would be nearer heaven than the Christians, for infidels
often excel in civil righteousness.

  VERSE 10. For it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in
   all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

Paul goes on to prove from this quotation out of the Book of Deuteronomy that all men who are
under the Law are under the sentence of sin, of the wrath of God, and of everlasting death.
Paul produces his proof in a roundabout way. He turns the negative statement, "Cursed is every
one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them,"
into a positive statement, "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse." These
two statements, one by Paul and the other by Moses, appear to conflict. Paul declares, "Whosoever
shall do the works of the Law, is accursed." Moses declares, "Whosoever shall not do the works
of the Law, is accursed." How can these two contradictory statements be reconciled? How can
the one statement prove the other? No person can hope to understand Paul unless he understands
the article of justification. These two statements are not at all inconsistent.

We must bear in mind that to do the works of the Law does not mean only to live up to the superficial
requirements of the Law, but to obey the spirit of the Law to perfection. But where will you
find the person who can do that? Let him step forward and we will praise him.

Our opponents have their answer ready-made. They quote Paul's own statement in Romans 2:13,
"The doers of the law shall be justified." Very well. But let us first find out who the doers
of the law are. They call a "doer" of the Law one who performs the Law in its literal sense.
This is not to "do" the Law. This is to sin. When our opponents go about to perform the Law
they sin against the first, the second, and the third commandments, in fact they sin against
the whole Law. For God requires above all that we worship Him in spirit and in faith. In observing
the Law for the purpose of obtaining righteousness without faith in Christ these law-workers
go smack against the Law and against God. They deny the righteousness of God, His mercy, and
His promises. They deny Christ and all His benefits.

In their folly our opponents rush into the Scriptures, pick out a sentence here and a sentence
there about the Law and imagine they know all about it. Their work-righteousness is plain idolatry
and blasphemy against God. No wonder they abide under the curse of God.

Because God saw that we could not fulfill the Law, He provided a way of salvation long before
the Law was ever given, a salvation that He promised to Abraham, saying, "In thee shall all
nations be blessed."

The very first thing for us to do is to believe in Christ. First, we must receive the Holy
Spirit, who enlightens and sanctifies us so that we can begin to do the Law, i.e., to love
God and our neighbor. Now, the Holy  Ghost is not obtained by the Law, but by faith in Christ.
In the last analysis,  to do the Law means to believe in Jesus Christ. The tree comes first,
and  then come the fruits.

The scholastics admit that a mere external and superficial performance of the Law without sincerity
and good will is plain hypocrisy. Judas acted like the other disciples. What was wrong with
Judas? Mark what Rome answers, "Judas was a reprobate. His motives were perverse, therefore
his works were hypocritical and no good." Well, well. Rome does admit, after all, that works
in themselves do not justify unless they issue from a sincere heart. Why do our opponents not
profess the same truth in spiritual matters? There, above all, faith must precede everything.
The heart must be purified by faith before a person can lift a finger to please God.

There are two classes of doers of the Law, true doers and hypocritical doers. The true doers
of the Law are those who are moved by faith in Christ to do the Law. The hypocritical doers
of the Law are those who seek to obtain righteousness by a mechanical performance of good works
while their hearts are far removed from God. They act like the foolish carpenter who starts
with the roof when he builds a house. Instead of doing the Law, these law-conscious hypocrites
break the Law. They break the very first commandment of God by denying His promise in Christ.
They do not worship God in faith. They worship themselves.

No wonder Paul was able to foretell the abominations that Antichrist would bring into the Church.
That Antichrists would come, Christ Himself prophesied, Matthew 24:5, "For many shall come
in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many." Whoever seeks righteousness by works
denies God and makes himself God. He is an Antichrist because he ascribes to his own works
the omnipotent capability of conquering sin, death, devil, hell, and the wrath of God. An Antichrist
lays claim to the honor of Christ. He is an idolater of himself. The law- righteous person
is the worst kind of infidel.

Those who intend to obtain righteousness by their own efforts do not say in so many words:
"I am God; I am Christ." But it amounts to that. They usurp the divinity and office of Christ.
The effect is the same as if they said, "I am Christ; I am a Savior. I save myself and others."
This is the impression the monks give out.

The Pope is the Antichrist, because he is against Christ, because he takes liberties with the
things of God, because he lords it over the temple of God.

I cannot tell you in words how criminal it is to seek righteousness before God without faith
in Christ, by the works of the Law. It is the abomination standing in the holy place. It deposes
the Creator and deifies the creature.

The real doers of the Law are the true believers. The Holy Spirit enables them to love God
and their neighbor. But because we have only the first- fruits of the Spirit and not the tenth-fruits,
we do not observe the Law perfectly. This imperfection of ours, however, is not imputed to
us, for Christ's sake.

Hence, the statement of Moses, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which
are written in the book of the law to do them," is not contrary to Paul. Moses requires perfect
doers of the Law. But where will you find them? Nowhere. Moses himself confessed that he was
not a perfect doer of the Law. He said to the Lord: "Pardon our iniquity and our sin." Christ
alone can make us innocent of any transgression. How so? First, by the forgiveness of our sins
and the imputation of His righteousness. Secondly, by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who engenders
new life and activity in us.

                Objections to the Doctrine of Faith Disproved

Here we shall take the time to enter upon the objections which our opponents raise against
the doctrine of faith. There are many passages in the Bible that deal with works and the reward
of works which our opponents cite against us in the belief that these will disprove the doctrine
of faith which we teach.

The scholastics grant that according to the reasonable order of nature being precedes doing.
They grant that any act is faulty unless it proceeds from a right motive. They grant that a
person must be right before he can do right. Why don't they grant that the right inclination
of the heart toward God through faith in Christ must precede works?

In the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews we find a catalogue of various works
and deeds of the saints of the Bible. David, who killed a lion and a bear, and defeated Goliath,
is mentioned. In the heroic deeds of David the scholastic can discover nothing more than outward
achievement. But the deeds of David must be evaluated according to the personality of David.
When we understand that David was a man of faith, whose heart trusted in the Lord, we shall
understand why he could do such heroic deeds. (I Samuel 17:37, 45, 46.) Before David could
achieve a single heroic deed he was already a man beloved of God, strong and constant in faith.
When the scholastics come upon the parallel passage in Genesis 4:4 they get no further than
the words: "And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering." "Aha!" they cry. "See,
God has respect to offerings. Works do justify." With mud in their eyes they cannot see that
the text says in Genesis that the Lord had respect to the person of Abel first. Abel pleased
the Lord because of his faith. Because the person of Abel pleased the Lord, the offering of
Abel pleased the Lord also.

In our dealings with God the work is worth nothing without faith, for "without faith it is
impossible to please him." (Hebrews 11:6.) The sacrifice of Abel was better than the sacrifice
of Cain, because Abel had faith. As to Cain he had no faith or trust in God's grace, but strutted
about in his own fancied worth. When God refused to recognize Cain's worth, Cain got angry
at God and at Abel. The Holy Spirit speaks of faith in different ways in the Sacred Scriptures.
Sometimes He speaks of faith independently of other matters. When the Scriptures speak of faith
in the absolute or abstract, faith refers to justification directly. But when the Scripture
speaks of rewards and works it speaks of compound or relative faith. We will furnish some examples.
Galatians 5:6, "Faith which worketh by love." Leviticus 18:5, "Which if a man do, he shall
live in them." Matthew 19:17, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." Psalm
37:27, "Depart from evil, and do good." In these and other passages where mention is made of
doing, the Scriptures always speak of a faithful doing, a doing inspired by faith. "Do this
and thou shalt live," means: First have faith in Christ, and Christ will enable you to do and
to live.

In the Word of God all things that are attributed to works are attributable to faith. Faith
is the divinity of works. Faith permeates all the deeds of the believer, as Christ's divinity
permeated His humanity. Abraham was accounted righteous because faith pervaded his whole personality
and his every action. (Hebrews 11:33.) In this way will we correctly interpret all those passages
that seem to support the righteousness of works. The Law is truly observed only through faith.
Hence, every "holy," "moral" law-worker is accursed.

Supposing that this explanation will not satisfy the scholastics, supposing that they should
completely wrap me up in their arguments (they cannot do it), I would rather be wrong and give
all credit to Christ alone. Here is Christ. I conclude, therefore, that it is up to Christ
to overcome my sins, and not up to the Law, or my own efforts. If He is the price of my redemption,
if He was made sin for my justification, I don't give a care if you quote me a thousand Scripture
passages for the righteousness of works against the righteousness of faith. I have the Author
and Lord of the Scriptures on my side. I would rather believe Him than all that riffraff of
"pious" law- workers.

The Apostle draws into his argument the testimony of the Prophet Habakkuk: "The just shall
live by his faith." This passage carries much weight because it eliminates the Law and the
deeds of the Law as factors in the process of our justification.

The scholastics misconstrue this passage by saying: "The just shall live by faith, if it is
a working faith, or a faith formed and performed by charitable works." Their annotation is
a forgery. To speak of formed or unformed faith, a sort of double faith, is contrary to the
Scriptures. If charitable works can form and perfect faith I am forced to say eventually that
charitable deeds constitute the essential factor in the Christian religion. Christ and His
benefits would be lost to us.

  VERSE 12. And the law is not of faith.

In direct opposition to the scholastics Paul declares: "The law is not of faith." What is this
charity the scholastics talk so much about? Does not the Law command charity? (Deut. 6:5.)
"Strewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments." (Exodus 20:6.)
"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." (Matt. 22:40.) If the law requires
charity, charity is part of the Law and not of faith. Since Christ has displaced the Law which
commands charity, it follows that charity has been abrogated with the Law as a factor in our
justification, and only faith is left.

  VERSE 12. But, The man that doeth them shall live in them.

Paul undertakes to explain the difference between the righteousness of the Law and the righteousness
of faith. The righteousness of the Law is the fulfillment of the Law according to the passage:
"The man that doeth them shall live in them." The righteousness of faith is to believe the
Gospel according to the passage: "The just shall live by faith." The Law is a statement of
debit, the Gospel a statement of credit. By this distinction Paul explains why charity which
is the commandment of the Law cannot justify, because the Law contributes nothing to our justification.

Indeed, works do follow after faith, but faith is not therefore a meritorious work. Faith is
a gift. The character and limitations of the Law must be rigidly maintained.

When we believe in Christ we live by faith. When we believe in the Law we may be active enough
but we have no life. The function of the Law is not to give life; the function of the Law is
to kill. True, the Law says: "The man that doeth them shall live in them." But where is the
person who can do "them," i.e., love God with all his heart, soul, and mind, and his neighbor
as himself?

Paul has nothing against those who are justified by faith and therefore are true doers of the
Law. He opposes those who think they can fulfill the Law when in reality they can only sin
against the Law by trying to obtain righteousness by the Law. The Law demands that we fear,
love, and worship God with a true faith. The law-workers fail to do this. Instead, they invent
new modes of worship and new kinds of works which God never commanded. (Matthew 15:9.) Hence,
the law-righteous workers are downright rebels against God, and idolaters who constantly sin
against the first commandment. In short, they are no good at-all though outwardly they seem
to be extremely solicitous of the honor of God.

We who are justified by faith as the saints of old, may be under the Law, but we are not under
the curse of the Law because sin is not imputed to us for Christ's sake. If the Law cannot
be fulfilled by the believers, if sin continues to cling to them despite their love for God,
what can you expect of people who are not yet justified by faith, who are still enemies of
God and His Word, like the unbelieving law-workers? It goes to show how impossible it is for
those who have not been justified by faith to fulfill the Law.

Jerome and his present-day followers rack their miserable brains over this comforting passage
in an effort to save Christ from the fancied insult of being called a curse. They say: "This
quotation from Moses does not apply to Christ. Paul is taking liberties with Moses by generalizing
the statements in Deuteronomy 21:23. Moses has 'he that is hanged.' Paul puts it 'every one
that hangeth.' On the other hand, Paul omits the words 'of God' in his quotation from Moses:
'For he that is hanged is accursed of God.' Moses speaks of a criminal who is worthy of death."
"How," our opponents ask, "can this passage be applied to the holy Christ as if He were accursed
of God and worthy to be hanged?" This piece of exegesis may impress the naive as a zealous
attempt to defend the honor and glory of Christ. Let us see what Paul has in mind.

Paul does not say that Christ was made a curse for Himself. The accent is on the two words
"for us." Christ is personally innocent. Personally, He did not deserve to be hanged for any
crime of His own doing. But because Christ took the place of others who were sinners, He was
hanged like any other transgressor. The Law of Moses leaves no loopholes. It says that a transgressor
should be hanged. Who are the other sinners? We are. The sentence of death and everlasting
damnation had long been pronounced over us. But Christ took all our sins and died for them
on the Cross. "He was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors." (Isaiah 53:12.)

All the prophets of old said that Christ should be the greatest transgressor, murderer, adulterer,
thief, blasphemer that ever was or ever could be on earth. When He took the sins of the whole
world upon Himself, Christ was no longer an innocent person. He was a sinner burdened with
the sins of a Paul who was a blasphemer; burdened with the sins of a Peter who denied Christ;
burdened with the sins of a David who committed adultery and murder, and gave the heathen occasion
to laugh at the Lord. In short, Christ was charged with the sins of all men, that He should
pay for them with His own blood. The curse struck Him. The Law found Him among sinners. He
was not only in the company of sinners. He had gone so far as to invest Himself with the flesh
and blood of sinners. So the Law judged and hanged Him for a sinner.

In separating Christ from us sinners and holding Him up as a holy exemplar, errorists rob us
of our best comfort. They misrepresent Him as a threatening tyrant who is ready to slaughter
us at the slightest provocation.

I am told that it is preposterous and wicked to call the Son of God a cursed sinner. I answer:
If you deny that He is a condemned sinner, you are forced to deny that Christ died. It is not
less preposterous to say, the Son of God died, than to say, the Son of God was a sinner.

John the Baptist called Him "the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." Being
the unspotted Lamb of God, Christ was personally innocent. But because He took the sins of
the world His sinlessness was defiled with the sinfulness of the world. Whatever sins I, you,
all of us have committed or shall commit, they are Christ's sins as if He had committed them
Himself. Our sins have to be Christ's sins or we shall perish forever.

Isaiah declares of Christ: "The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." We have no right
to minimize the force of this declaration. God does not amuse Himself with words. What a relief
for a Christian to know that Christ is covered all over with my sins, your sins, and the sins
of the whole world.

The papists invented their own doctrine of faith. They say charity creates and adorns their
faith. By stripping Christ of our sins, by making Him sinless, they cast our sins back at us,
and make Christ absolutely worthless to us. What sort of charity is this? If that is a sample
of their vaunted charity we want none of it.

Our merciful Father in heaven saw how the Law oppressed us and how impossible it was for us
to get out from under the curse of the Law. He therefore sent His only Son into the world and
said to Him: "You are now Peter, the liar; Paul, the persecutor; David, the adulterer; Adam,
the disobedient; the thief on the cross. You, My Son, must pay the world's iniquity." The Law
growls: "All right. If Your Son is taking the sin of the world, I see no sins anywhere else
but in Him. He shall die on the Cross." And the Law kills Christ. But we go free.

The argument of the Apostle against the righteousness of the Law is impregnable. If Christ
bears our sins, we do not bear them. But if Christ is innocent of our sins and does not bear
them, we must bear them, and we shall die in our sins. "But thanks be to God, which giveth
us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

Let us see how Christ was able to gain the victory over our enemies. The sins of the whole
world, past, present, and future, fastened themselves upon Christ and condemned Him. But because
Christ is God He had an everlasting and unconquerable righteousness. These two, the sin of
the world and the righteousness of God, met in a death struggle. Furiously the sin of the world
assailed the righteousness of God. Righteousness is immortal and invincible. On the other hand,
sin is a mighty tyrant who subdues all men. This tyrant pounces on Christ. But Christ's righteousness
is unconquerable. The result is inevitable. Sin is defeated and righteousness triumphs and
reigns forever.

In the same manner was death defeated. Death is emperor of the world. He strikes down kings,
princes, all men. He has an idea to destroy all life. But Christ has immortal life, and life
immortal gained the victory over death. Through Christ death has lost her sting. Christ is
the Death of death.

The curse of God waged a similar battle with the eternal mercy of God in Christ. The curse
meant to condemn God's mercy. But it could not do it because the mercy of God is everlasting.
The curse had to give way. If the mercy of God in Christ had lost out, God Himself would have
lost out, which, of course, is impossible. (Col. 2:15.) They cannot harm those who hide in
Christ. Sin, death, the wrath of God, hell, the devil are mortified in Christ. Where Christ
is near the powers of evil must keep their distance. St. John says: "And this is the victory
that overcometh the world, even our faith." (I John 5:4.)

You may now perceive why it is imperative to believe and confess the divinity of Christ. To
overcome the sin of a whole world, and death, and the wrath of God was no work for any creature.
The power of sin and death could be broken only by a greater power. God alone could abolish
sin, destroy death, and take away the curse of the Law. God alone could bring righteousness,
life, and mercy to light. In attributing these achievements to Christ the Scriptures pronounce
Christ to be God forever. The article of justification is indeed fundamental. If we remain
sound in this one article, we remain sound in all the other articles of the Christian faith.
When we teach justification by faith in Christ we confess at the same time that Christ is God.

I cannot get over the blindness of the Pope's theologians. To imagine that the mighty forces
of sin, death, and the curse can be vanquished by the righteousness of man's paltry works,
by fasting, pilgrimages, masses, vows, and such gewgaws. These blind leaders of the blind turn
the poor people over to the mercy of sin, death, and the devil. What chance has a defenseless
human creature against these powers of darkness? They train sinners who are ten times worse
than any thief, whore, murderer. The divine power of God alone can destroy sin and death, and
create righteousness and life.

When we hear that Christ was made a curse for us, let us believe it with joy and assurance.
By faith Christ changes places with us. He gets our sins, we get His holiness.

By faith alone can we become righteous, for faith invests us with the sinlessness of Christ.
The more fully we believe this, the fuller will be our joy. If you believe that sin, death,
and the curse are void, why, they are null, zero. Whenever sin and death make you nervous write
it down as an illusion of the devil. There is no sin now, no curse, no death, no devil because
Christ has done away with them. This fact is sure. There is nothing wrong with the fact. The
defect lies in our lack of faith.

In the Apostolic Creed we confess: "I believe in the holy Christian Church." That means, I
believe that there is no sin, no curse, no evil in the Church of God. Faith says: "I believe
that." But if you want to believe your eyes you will find many shortcomings and offenses in
the members of the holy Church. You see them succumb to temptation, you see them weak in faith,
you see them giving way to anger, envy, and other evil dispositions. "How can the Church be
holy?" you ask. It is with the Christian Church as it is with the individual Christian. If
I examine myself I find enough unholiness to shock me. But when I look at Christ in me I find
that I am altogether holy. And so it is with the Church.

Holy Writ does not say that Christ was under the curse. It says directly that Christ was made
a curse. Although this and similar passages may be properly explained by saying that Christ
was made a sacrifice for the curse and for sin, yet in my judgment it is better to leave these
passages stand as they read: Christ was made sin itself; Christ was made the curse itself.
When a sinner gets wise to himself he does not only feel miserable, he feels like misery personified;
he does not only feel like a sinner, he feels like sin itself.

To finish with this verse: All evils would have overwhelmed us, as they shall overwhelm the
unbelievers forever, if Christ had not become the great transgressor and guilty bearer of all
our sins. The sins of the world got Him down for a moment. They came around Him like water.
Of Christ, the Old Testament Prophet complained: "Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors
have cut me off." (Psalm 88 16.) By Christ's salvation we have been delivered from the terrors
of God to a life of eternal felicity.

  VERSE 14. That the blessing of Abraham might come, on the Gentiles
  through Jesus Christ.

Paul always keeps this text before him: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed." The blessing promised unto Abraham could come upon the Gentiles only by Christ, the
seed of Abraham. To become a blessing unto all nations Christ had to be made a curse to take
away the curse from the nations of the earth. The merit that we plead, and the work that we
proffer is Christ who was made a curse for us.

Let us become expert in the art of transferring our sins, our death, and every evil from ourselves
to Christ; and Christ's righteousness and blessing from Christ to ourselves.

  VERSE 14. That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

"The promise of the Spirit" is Hebrew for "the promised Spirit." The Spirit spells freedom
from the Law, sin, death, the curse, hell, and the judgment of God. No merits are mentioned
in connection with this promise of the Spirit and all the blessings that go with Him. This
Spirit of many blessings is received by faith alone. Faith alone builds on the promises of
God, as Paul says in this verse.

Long ago the prophets visualized the happy changes Christ would effect in all things. Despite
the fact that the Jews had the Law of God they never ceased to look longingly for Christ. After
Moses no prophet or king added a single law to the Book. Any changes or additions were deferred
to the time of Christ's coming. 18:15.)

God's people of old felt that the Law of Moses could not be improved upon until the Messiah
would bring better things than the Law, i.e., grace and remission of sins.

  VERSE 15.

After the preceding, well-taken argument, Paul offers another based on the similarity between
a man's testament and God's testament. A man's testament seems too weak a premise for the Apostle
to argue from in confirmation of so important a matter as justification. We ought to prove
earthly things by heavenly things, and not heavenly things by earthly things. But where the
earthly thing is an ordinance of God we may use it to prove divine matters.

To come to Paul's argument. Civil law, which is God's ordinance, prohibits tampering with any
testament of man. Any person's last will and testament must be respected. Paul asks: "Why is
it that man's last will is scrupulously respected and not God's testament? You would not think
of breaking faith with a man's testament. Why do you not keep faith with God's testament?"

The Apostle says that he is speaking after the manner of men. He means to say: "I will give
you an illustration from the customs of men. If a man's last will is respected. and it is,
how much more ought the testament of God be honored: 'In thy seed shall all the nations of
the earth be blessed.' When Christ died, this testament was sealed by His blood. After His
death the testament was opened, it was published to the nations. No man ought to alter God's
testament as the false apostles do who substitute the Law and traditions of men for the testament
of God."

As the false prophets tampered with God's testament in the days of Paul, so many do in our
day. They will observe human laws punctiliously, but the laws of God they transgress without
the flicker of an eyelid. But the time will come when they will find out that it is no joke
to pervert the testament of God.

The word testament is another name for the promise that God made unto Abraham concerning Christ.
A testament is not a law, but an inheritance. Heirs do not look for laws and assessments when
they open a last will; they look for grants and favors. The testament which God made out to
Abraham did not contain laws. It contained promises of great spiritual blessings.

The promises were made in view of Christ, in one seed, not in many seeds. The Jews will not
accept this interpretation. They insist that the singular "seed" is put for the plural "seeds."
We prefer the interpretation of Paul, who makes a fine case for Christ and for us out of the
singular "seed," and is after all inspired to do so by the Holy Ghost.

  VERSE 17.

The Jews assert that God was not satisfied with His promises, but after four hundred and thirty
years He gave the Law. "God," they say, "must have mistrusted His own promises, and considered
them inadequate for salvation. Therefore He added to His promises something better, the Law.
The Law," they say, "canceled the promises."

Paul answers: "The Law was given four hundred and thirty years after the promise was made to
Abraham. The Law could not cancel the promise because the promise was the testament of God,
confirmed by God in Christ many years before the Law. What God has once promised He does not
take back. Every promise of God is a ratified promise."

Why was the Law added to the promise? Not to serve as a medium by which the promise might be
obtained. The Law was added for these reasons: That there might be in the world a special people,
rigidly controlled by the Law, a people out of which Christ should be born in due time; and
that men burdened by many laws might sigh and long for Him, their Redeemer, the seed of Abraham.
Even the ceremonies prescribed by the Law foreshadowed Christ. Therefore the Law was never
meant to cancel the promise of God. The Law was meant to confirm the promise until the time
should come when God would open His testament in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

God did well in giving the promise so many years before the Law, that it may never be said
that righteousness is granted through the Law and not through the promise. If God had meant
for us to be justified by the Law, He would have given the Law four hundred and thirty years
before the promise, at least He would have given the Law at the same time He gave the promise.
But He never breathed a word about the Law until four hundred years after. The promise is therefore
better than the Law. The Law does not cancel the promise, but faith in the promised Christ
cancels the Law.

The Apostle is careful to mention the exact number of four hundred and thirty years. The wide
divergence in the time between the promise and the Law helps to clinch Paul's argument that
righteousness is not obtained by the Law.

Let me illustrate. A man of great wealth adopts a strange lad for his son. Remember, he does
not owe the lad anything. In due time he appoints the lad heir to his entire fortune. Several
years later the old man asks the lad to do something for him. And the young lad does it. Can
the lad then go around and say that he deserved the inheritance by his obedience to the old
man's request ? How can anybody say that righteousness is obtained by obedience to the Law
when the Law was given four hundred and thirty years after God's promise of the blessing?

One thing is certain, Abraham was never justified by the Law, for the simple reason that the
Law was not in his day. If the Law was non-existent how could Abraham obtain righteousness
by the Law? Abraham had nothing else to go by but the promise. This promise he believed and
that was counted unto him for righteousness. If the father obtained righteousness through faith,
the children get it the same way.

We use the argument of time also. We say our sins were taken away by the death of Christ fifteen
hundred years ago, long before there were any religious orders, canons, or rules of penance,
merits, etc. What did people do about their sins before these new inventions were hatched up?

Paul finds his arguments for the righteousness of faith everywhere. Even the element of time
serves to build his case against the false apostles. Let us fortify our conscience with similar
arguments. They help us in the trials of our faith. They turn our attention from the Law to
the promises, from sin to righteousness; from death to life.

It is not for nothing that Paul bears down on this argument. Truly neglect they go of themselves.

 In their ignorance the
papists spout about man's  good will and right judgment, and man's capacity to perform the
Law of  God. Ask the people of Israel who were present at the presentation of the  Law on Mount
Sinai whether what the scholastics say is true. Ask David,  who often complains in the Psalms
that he was cast away from God and in  hell, that he was frantic about his sin, and sick at
the thought of the wrath  and judgment of God. No, the Law does not justify.

  VERSE 20. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one.

Here the Apostle briefly compares the two mediators: Moses and Christ. "A mediator," says Paul,
"is not a mediator of one." He is necessarily a mediator of two: The offender and the offended.
Moses was such a mediator between the Law and the people who were offended at the Law. They
were offended at the Law because they did not understand its purpose. That was the veil which
Moses put over his face. The people were also offended at the Law because they could not look
at the bare face of Moses. It shone with the glory of God. When Moses addressed the people
he had to cover his face with that veil of his. They could not listen to their mediator Moses
without another mediator, the veil. The Law had to change its face and voice. In other words,
the Law had to be made tolerable to the people.

Thus covered, the Law no longer spoke to the people in its undisguised majesty. It became more
tolerable to the conscience. This explains why men fail to understand the Law properly, with
the result that they become secure and presumptuous hypocrites. One of two things has to be
done: Either the Law must be covered with a veil and then it loses its full effectiveness,
or it must be unveiled and then the full blast of its force kills. Man cannot stand the Law
without a veil over it. Hence, we are forced either to look beyond the Law to Christ, or we
go through life as shameless hypocrites and secure sinners.

Paul says: "A mediator is not a mediator of one." Moses could not be a mediator of God only,
for God needs no mediator. Again, Moses could not  be a mediator of the people only. He was
a mediator between God and the  people. It is the office of a mediator to conciliate the party
that is offended  and to placate the party that is the offender. However, Moses' mediation
consisted only in changing the tone of the Law to make it more tolerable  to the people. Moses
was merely a mediator of the veil. He could not  supply the ability to perform the Law.

What do you suppose would have happened if the Law had been given without a mediator and the
people had been denied the services of a go- between? The people would have perished, or in
case they had escaped they would have required the services of another mediator to preserve
them alive and to keep the Law in force. Moses came along and he was made the mediator. He
covered his face with a veil. But that is as much as he could do. He could not deliver men's
consciences from the terror of the Law. The sinner needs a better mediator.

That better mediator is Jesus Christ. He does not change the voice of the Law, nor does He
hide the Law with a veil. He takes the full blast of the wrath of the Law and fulfills its
demands most meticulously.

Of this better Mediator Paul says: "A mediator is not a mediator of one." We are the offending
party; God is the party offended. The offense is of such a nature that God cannot pardon it.
Neither can we render adequate satisfaction for our offenses. There is discord between God
and us. Could not God revoke His Law? No. How about running away from God? It cannot be done.
It took Christ to come between us and God and to reconcile God to us. How did Christ do it?
Otherwise we should not need a mediator.

In Christian theology the Law does not justify. In fact it has the contrary effect. The Law
alarms us, it magnifies our sins until we begin to hate the Law and its divine Author. Would
you call this being justified by the Law?

Can you imagine a more arrant outrage than to hate God and to abhor His Law? What an excellent
Law it is. "Let not God speak with us, lest we die," cried the children of Israel. Is it not
amazing that a person should refuse to hear things that are good for him? Any person would
be glad to hear, I should think, that he has a gracious God who shows mercy unto thousands.

The Law can do nothing for us except to arouse the conscience. Before the Law comes to me I
feel no sin. But when the Law comes, sin, death, and hell are revealed to me. You would not
call this being made righteous. You would call it being condemned to death and hell-fire.

  VERSE 20. But God is one.

God does not offend anybody, therefore He needs no mediator. But we offend God, therefore we
need a mediator. And we need a better mediator than Moses. We need Christ.

  VERSE 21. Is the law then against the promises of God?

Before he digressed Paul stated that the Law does not justify. Shall we then discard the Law?
No, no. It supplies a certain need. It supplies men with a needed realization of their sinfulness.
Now arises another question: If the Law does no more than to reveal sin, does it not oppose
the promises of God? The Jews believed that by the restraint and discipline of the Law the
promises of God would be hastened, in fact earned by them.

Paul answers: "Not so. On the contrary, if we pay too much attention to the Law the promises
of God will be slowed up. How can God fulfill His promises to a people that hates the Law?"

  VERSE 21. God forbid.

God never said to Abraham: "In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou
hast kept the Law." When Abraham was still uncircumcised and without the Law or any law, indeed,
when he was still an idol worshiper, God said to him: "Get thee out of thy country, etc.; I
am thy shield, etc.; In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." These are
unconditional promises which God freely made to Abraham without respect to works.

This is aimed especially at the Jews who think that the promises of God are impeded by their
sins. Paul says: "The Lord is not slack concerning His promises because of our sins, or hastens
His promises because of any merit on our part." God's promises are not influenced by our attitudes.
They rest in His goodness and mercy.

Just because the Law increases sin, it does not therefore obstruct the promises of God. The
Law confirms the promises, in that it prepares a person to look for the fulfillment of the
promises of God in Christ.

The proverb has it that Hunger is the best cook. The Law makes afflicted consciences hungry
for Christ. Christ tastes good to them. Hungry hearts appreciate Christ. Thirsty souls are
what Christ wants. He invites them: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest." Christ's benefits are so precious that He will dispense them only
to those who need them and really desire them.

  VERSE 21. For if there had been a law given which could have given
  life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.

The Law cannot give life. It kills. The Law does not justify a person before God; it increases
sin. The Law does not secure righteousness; it hinders righteousness. The Apostle declares
emphatically that the Law of itself cannot save.

Despite the intelligibility of Paul's statement, our enemies fail to grasp it. Otherwise they
would not emphasize free will, natural strength, the works of supererogation, etc. To escape
the charge of forgery they always have their convenient annotation handy, that Paul is referring
only to the ceremonial and not to the moral law. But Paul includes all laws. He expressly says:
"If there had been a law given."

There is no law by which righteousness may be obtained, not a single one. Why not?

  VERSE 22. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin.

Where? First in the promises concerning Christ in Genesis 3:15 and in Genesis 22:18, which
speak of the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham. The fact that these promises were made
unto the fathers concerning Christ implies that the fathers were subject to the curse of sin
and eternal death. Otherwise why the need of promises?

Next, Holy Writ "concludes" all under sin in this passage from Paul: "For as many as are of
the works of the law are under the curse." Again, in the passage which the Apostle quotes from
Deuteronomy 27:26, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written
in the book of the law to do them." This passage clearly submits all men to the curse, not
only those who sin openly against the Law, but also those who sincerely endeavor to perform
the Law, inclusive of monks, friars, hermits, etc.

The conclusion is inevitable: Faith alone justified without works. If the Law itself cannot
justify, much less can imperfect performance of the Law or the works of the Law, justify.

  VERSE 22. That the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to
  them that believe.

The Apostle stated before that "the Scripture hath concluded all under sin." Forever? No, only
until the promise should be fulfilled. The promise, you will recall, is the inheritance itself
or the blessing promised to Abraham, deliverance from the Law, sin, death, and the devil, and
the free gift of grace, righteousness, salvation, and eternal life. This promise, says Paul,
is not obtained by any merit, by any law, or by any work. This promise is given. To whom? To
those who believe. In whom? In Jesus Christ.

  VERSE 23. But before faith came.

The Apostle proceeds to explain the service which the Law is to render. Previously Paul had
said that the Law was given to reveal the wrath and death of God upon all sinners. Although
the Law kills, God brings good out of evil. He uses the Law to bring life. God saw that the
universal illusion of self-righteousness could not be put down in any other way but by the
Law. The Law dispels all self-illusions. It puts the fear of God in a man. Without this fear
there can be no thirst for God's mercy. God accordingly uses the Law for a hammer to break
up the illusion of self- righteousness, that we should despair of our own strength and efforts
at self-justification.

  VERSE 23. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
  unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

The Law is a prison to those who have not as yet obtained grace. No prisoner enjoys the confinement.
He hates it. If he could he would smash the prison and find his freedom at all cost. As long
as he stays in prison he refrains from evil deeds. Not because he wants to, but because he
has to. The bars and the chains restrain him. He does not regret the crime that put him in
jail. On the contrary, he is mighty sore that he cannot rob and kill as before. If he could
escape he would go right back to robbing and killing.

The Law enforces good behavior, at least outwardly. We obey the Law because if we don't we
will be punished. Our obedience is inspired by fear. We obey under duress and we do it resentfully.
Now what kind of righteousness is this when we refrain from evil out of fear of punishment?
Hence, the righteousness of the Law is at bottom nothing but love of sin and hatred of righteousness.

All the same, the Law accomplishes this much, that it will outwardly at least and to a certain
extent repress vice and crime.

But the Law is also a spiritual prison, a veritable hell. When the Law begins to threaten a
person with death and the eternal wrath of God, a man just cannot find any comfort at all.
He cannot shake off at will the nightmare of terror which the Law stirs up in his conscience.
Of this terror of the Law the Psalms furnish many glimpses.

The Law is a civil and a spiritual prison. And such it should be. For that the Law is intended.
Only the confinement in the prison of the Law must not be unduly prolonged. It must come to
an end. The freedom of faith must succeed the imprisonment of the Law.

Happy the person who knows how to utilize the Law so that it serves the purposes of grace and
of faith. Unbelievers are ignorant of this happy knowledge. When Cain was first shut up in
the prison of the Law he felt no pang at the fratricide he had committed. He thought he could
pass it off as an incident with a shrug of the shoulder. "Am I my brother's keeper?" he answered
God flippantly. Did he know how to get out of prison? No. He failed to call the Gospel to his
aid. He said: "My punishment is greater than I can bear." He could only think of the prison.
He forgot that he was brought face to face with his crime so that he should hurry to God for
mercy and for pardon. Cain remained in the prison of the Law and despaired.

As a stone prison proves a physical handicap, so the spiritual prison of the Law proves a chamber
of torture. But this it should only be until faith be revealed. The silly conscience must be
educated to this. Talk to your conscience. Say: "Sister, you are now in jail all right. But
you don't have to stay there forever. It is written that we are 'shut up unto faith which should
afterwards be revealed.' Christ will lead you to freedom. Do not despair like Cain, Saul, or
Judas. They might have gone free if they had called Christ to their aid. Just take it easy,
Sister Conscience. It's good for  you to be locked up for a while. It will teach you to appreciate
Christ."

How anybody can say that he by nature loves the Law is beyond me. The Law is a prison to be
feared and hated. Any unconverted person who says he loves the Law is a liar. He does not know
what he is talking about. We love the Law about as well as a murderer loves his gloomy cell,
his straight-jacket, and the iron bars in front of him. How then can the Law justify us?

  VERSE 23. Shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

We know that Paul has reference to the time of Christ's coming. It was then that faith and
the object of faith were fully revealed. But we may apply the historical fact to our inner
life. When Christ came He abolished the Law and brought liberty and life to light. This He
continues to do in the hearts of the believers. The Christian has a body in whose members,
as Paul says, sin dwells and wars. I take sin to mean not only the deed but root, tree, fruit,
and all. A Christian may perhaps not fall into the gross sins of murder, adultery, theft, but
he is not free from impatience, complaints, hatreds, and blasphemy of God. As carnal lust is
strong in a young man, in a man of full age the desire for glory, and in an old man covetousness,
so impatience, doubt, and hatred of God often prevail in the hearts of sincere Christians.
Examples of these sins may be garnered from the Psalms, Job, Jeremiah, and all the Sacred Scriptures.

Accordingly each Christian continues to experience in his heart times of the Law and times
of the Gospel. The times of the Law are discernible by heaviness of heart, by a lively sense
of sin, and a feeling of despair brought on by the Law. These periods of the Law will come
again and again as long as we live. To mention my own case. There are many times when I find
fault with God and am impatient with Him. The wrath and the judgment of God displease me, my
wrath and impatience displease Him. Then is the season of the Law, when "the flesh lusteth
against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."

The time of grace returns when the heart is enlivened by the promise of God's mercy. It soliloquizes:
"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Can you see nothing
but law, sin, death, and hell? Is there no grace, no forgiveness, no joy, peace, life, heaven,
no Christ and God? Trouble me no more, my soul. Hope in God who has not spared His own dear
Son but has given Him into death for thy sins." When the Law carries things too far, say: "Mister
Law, you are not the whole show. There are other and better things than you. They tell me to
trust in the Lord."

There is a time for the Law and a time for grace. Let us study to be good timekeepers. It is
not easy. Law and grace may be miles apart in essence, but in the heart, they are pretty close
together. In the heart fear and trust, sin and grace, Law and Gospel cross paths continually.

Whether reason hears that justification before God is obtained by grace alone, it draws the
inference that the Law is without value. The doctrine of the Law must therefore be studied
carefully lest we either reject the Law altogether, or are tempted to attribute to the Law
a capacity to save.

There are three ways in which the Law may be abused. First, by the self- righteous hypocrites
who fancy that they can be justified by the Law. Secondly, by those who claim that Christian
liberty exempts a Christian from the observance of the Law. "These," says Peter, "use their
liberty for a cloak of maliciousness," and bring the name and the Gospel of Christ into ill
repute. Thirdly, the Law is abused by those who do not understand that the Law is meant to
drive us to Christ. When the Law is properly used its value cannot be too highly appraised.
It will take me to Christ every time.

  VERSE 24. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
  Christ.

This simile of the schoolmaster is striking. Schoolmasters are indispensable. But show me a
pupil who loves his schoolmaster. How little love is lost upon them the Jews showed by their
attitude toward Moses. They would have been glad to stone Moses to death. (Ex. 17:4.) You cannot
expect anything else. How can a pupil love a teacher who frustrates his desires? And if the
pupil disobeys, the schoolmaster whips him, and the pupil has to like it and even kiss the
rod with which he was beaten. Do you think the schoolboy feels good about it? As soon as the
teacher turns his back, the pupil breaks the rod and throws it into the fire. And if he were
stronger than the teacher he would not take the beatings, but beat up the teacher. All the
same, teachers are indispensable, otherwise the children would grow up without discipline,
instruction, and training.

But how long are the scolding and the whippings of the schoolmaster to continue? Only for a
time, until the boy has been trained to be a worthy heir of his father. No father wants his
son to be whipped all the time. The discipline is to last until the boy has been trained to
be his father's worthy successor.

The Law is such a schoolmaster. Not for always, but until we have been brought to Christ. The
Law is not just another schoolmaster. The Law is a specialist to bring us to Christ. What would
you think of a schoolmaster who could only torment and beat a child? Yet of such schoolmasters
there were plenty in former times, regular bruisers. The Law is not that kind of a schoolmaster.
It is not to torment us always. With its lashings it is only too anxious to drive us to Christ.
The Law is like the good schoolmaster who trains his children to find pleasure in doing things
they formerly detested.

  VERSE 24. That we might be justified by faith.

The Law is not to teach us another Law. When a person feels the full force of the Law he is
likely to think: I have transgressed all the commandments of God; I am guilty of eternal death.
If God will spare me I will change and live right from now on. This natural but entirely wrong
reaction to the Law has bred the many ceremonies and works devised to earn grace and remission
of sins.

The Law means to enlarge my sins, to make me small, so that I may be justified by faith in
Christ. Faith is neither law nor word; but confidence in Christ "who is the end of the law."
How so is Christ the end of the Law? Not in this way that He replaced the old Law with new
laws. Nor is Christ the end of the Law in a way that makes Him a hard judge who has to be bribed
by works as the papists teach. Christ is the end or finish of the Law to all who believe in
Him. The Law can no longer accuse or condemn them.

But what does the Law accomplish for those who have been justified by Christ? Paul answers
this question next.

  VERSE 25. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
  schoolmaster.

The Apostle declares that we are free from the Law. Christ fulfilled the Law for us. We may
live in joy and safety under Christ. The trouble is, our flesh will not let us believe in Christ
with all our heart. The fault lies not with Christ, but with us. Sin clings to us as long as
we live and spoils our happiness in Christ. Hence, we are only partly free from the Law. "With
the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin." (Romans 7:25.)

As far as the conscience is concerned it may cheerfully ignore the Law. But because sin continues
to dwell in the flesh, the Law waits around to molest our conscience. More and more, however,
Christ increases our faith and in the measure in which our faith is increased, sin, Law, and
flesh subside.

If anybody objects to the Gospel and the sacraments on the ground that Christ has taken away
our sins once and for always, you will know what to answer. You will answer: Indeed, Christ
has taken away my sins. But my flesh, the world, and the devil interfere with my faith. The
little light of faith in my heart does not shine all over me at once. It is a gradual diffusion.
In the meanwhile I console myself with the thought that eventually my flesh will be made perfect
in the resurrection.

  VERSE 26. For we are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

Paul as a true apostle of faith always has the word "faith" on the tip of his tongue. By faith,
says he, we are the children of God. The Law cannot beget children of God. It cannot regenerate
us. It can only remind us of the old birth by which we were born into the kingdom of the devil.
The best the Law can do for us is to prepare us for a new birth through faith in Christ Jesus.
Faith in Christ regenerates us into the children of God.

  VERSE 27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
  put on Christ.

To "put on Christ" may be understood in two ways, according to the Law and according to the
Gospel. According to the Law as in Romans 13:14, "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ," which means
to follow the example of Christ.

To put on Christ according to the Gospel means to clothe oneself with the righteousness, wisdom,
power, life, and Spirit of Christ. By nature we are clad in the garb of Adam. This garb Paul
likes to call "the old man." Before we can become the children of God this old man must be
put off, as Paul says, Ephesians 4:29. The garment of Adam must come off like soiled clothes.
Of course, it is not as simple as changing one's clothes. But God makes it simple. He clothes
us with the righteousness of Christ by means of Baptism, as the Apostle says in this verse:
"As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." With this change of
garments a new birth, a new life stirs in us. New affections toward God spring up in the heart.
New determinations affect our will. All this is to put on Christ according to the Gospel. Needless
to say, when we have put on the robe of the righteousness of Christ we must not forget to put
on also the mantle of the imitation of Christ. The list might be extended indefinitely: There
is neither preacher nor hearer, neither teacher nor scholar, neither master nor servant, etc.
In the matter of salvation, rank, learning, righteousness, influence count for nothing.

With this statement Paul deals a death blow to the Law. When a person has put on Christ nothing
else matters. Whether a person is a Jew, a punctilious and circumcised observer of the Law
of Moses, or whether a person is a noble and wise Greek does not matter. Circumstances, personal
worth, character, achievements have no bearing upon justification. Before God they count for
nothing. What counts is that we put on Christ.

Whether a servant performs his duties well; whether those who are in authority govern wisely;
whether a man marries, provides for his family, and is an honest citizen; whether a woman is
chaste, obedient to her husband, and a good mother: all these advantages do not qualify a person
for salvation. These virtues are commendable, of course; but they do not count points for justification.
All the best laws, ceremonies, religions, and deeds of the world cannot take away sin guilt,
cannot dispatch death, cannot purchase life.

There is much disparity among men in the world, but there is no such disparity before God.
"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23.) Let the Jews, let
the Greeks, let the whole world keep silent in the presence of God. Those who are justified
are justified by Christ. Without faith in Christ the Jew with his laws, the monk with his holy
orders, the Greek with his wisdom, the servant with his obedience, shall perish forever.

  VERSE 28. For ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

There is much imparity among men in the world. And it is a good thing. If the woman would change
places with the man, if the son would change places with the father, the servant with the master,
nothing but confusion would result. In Christ, however, all are equal. We all have one and
the same Gospel, "one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all," one Christ and Savior
of all. The Christ of Peter, Paul, and all the saints is our Christ. Paul can always be depended
on to add the conditional clause, "In Christ Jesus." If we lose sight of Christ, we lose out.

"If ye be Christ's" means, if you believe in Christ. If you believe in Christ, then are you
the children of Abraham indeed. Through our faith in Christ Abraham gains paternity over us
and over the nations of the earth according to the promise: "In thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed." Through faith we belong to Christ and Christ to us.

                                  CHAPTER 4

  VERSE 1. Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
  nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all;

  VERSE 2. But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed
  of the father.

THE Apostle had apparently finished his discourse on justification when this illustration of
the youthful heir occurred to him. He throws it in for good measure. He knows that plain people
are sooner impressed by an apt illustration than by learned discussion.

"I want to give you another illustration from everyday life," he writes to the Galatians. "As
long as an heir is under age he is treated very much like a servant. He is not permitted to
order his own affairs. He is kept under constant surveillance. Such discipline is good for
him, otherwise he would waste his inheritance in no time. This discipline, however, is not
to last forever. It is to last only until 'the time appointed of the father.' "

  VERSE 3. Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage
  under the elements of the world.

As children of the Law we were treated like servants and prisoners. We were oppressed and condemned
by the Law. But the tyranny of the Law is not to last forever. It is to last only until "the
time appointed of the father," until Christ came and redeemed us.

  VERSE 3. Under the elements of the world.

By the elements of the world the Apostle does not understand the physical elements, as some
have thought. In calling the Law "the elements of the world" Paul means to say that the Law
is something material, mundane, earthly. It may restrain evil, but it does not deliver from
sin. The Law does not justify; it does not bring a person to heaven. I do not obtain eternal
life because I do not kill, commit adultery, steal, etc. Such mere outward decency does not
constitute Christianity. The heathen observe the same restraints to avoid punishment or to
secure the advantages of a good reputation. In the last analysis such restraint is simple hypocrisy.
When the Law exercises its higher function it accuses and condemns the conscience. All these
effects of the Law cannot be called divine or heavenly. These effects are elements of the world.

In calling the Law the elements of the world Paul refers to the whole Law, principally to the
ceremonial law which dealt with external matters, as meat, drink, dress, places, times, feasts,
cleansings, sacrifices, etc. These are mundane matters which cannot save the sinner. Ceremonial
laws are like the statutes of governments dealing with purely civil matters, as commerce, inheritance,
etc. As for the pope's church laws forbidding marriage and meats, Paul calls them elsewhere
the doctrines of devils. You would not call such laws elements of heaven.

The Law of Moses deals with mundane matters. It holds the mirror to the evil which is in the
world. By revealing the evil that is in us it creates a longing in the heart for the better
things of God. The Law forces us into the arms of Christ, "who is the end of the law for righteousness
to every one that believeth." (Romans 1:4.) Christ relieves the conscience of the Law. In so
far as the Law impels us to Christ it renders excellent service.

I do not mean to give the impression that the Law should be despised. Neither does Paul intend
to leave that impression. The Law ought to be honored. But when it is a matter of justification
before God, Paul had to speak disparagingly of the Law, because the Law has nothing to do with
justification. If it thrusts its nose into the business of justification we must talk harshly
to the Law to keep it in its place. The conscience ought not to be on speaking terms with the
Law. The conscience ought to know only Christ. To say this is easy, but in times of trial,
when the conscience writhes in the presence of God, it is not so easy to do. As such times
we are to believe in Christ as if there were no Law or sin anywhere, but only Christ. We ought
to say to the Law: "Mister Law, I do not get you. You stutter so much. I don't think that you
have anything to say to me."

When it is not a question of salvation or justification with us, we are to think highly of
the Law and call it "holy, just, and good." (Romans 7:12) The Law is of no comfort to a stricken
conscience. Therefore it should not be allowed to rule in our conscience, particularly in view
of the fact that Christ paid so great a price to deliver the conscience from the tyranny of
the Law. Let us understand that the Law and Christ are impossible bedfellows. The Law must
leave the bed of the conscience, which is so narrow that it cannot hold two, as Isaiah says,
chapter 28, verse 20.

Only Paul among the apostles calls the Law "the elements of the world, weak and beggarly elements,
the strength of sin, the letter that killeth," etc. The other apostles do not speak so slightingly
of the Law. Those who want to be first-class scholars in the school of Christ want to pick
up the language of Paul. Christ called him a chosen vessel and equipped with a facility of
expression far above that of the other apostles, that he as the chosen vessel should establish
the doctrine of justification in clear-cut words.

  VERSES 4, 5.

"The fullness of the time" means when the time of the Law was fulfilled and Christ was revealed.
Note how Paul explains Christ. "Christ," says he, "is the Son of God and the son of a woman.
He submitted Himself under the Law to redeem us who were under the Law." In these words the
Apostle explains the person and office of Christ. His person is divine and human. "God sent
forth His Son, made of a woman." Christ therefore is true God and true man. Christ's office
the Apostle describes in the words: "Made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law."

Paul calls the Virgin Mary a woman. This has been frequently deplored even by some of the ancient
fathers who felt that Paul should have written "virgin" instead of woman. But Paul is now treating
of faith and Christian righteousness, of the person and office of Christ, not of the virginity
of Mary. The inestimable mercy of God is sufficiently set forth by the fact that His Son was
born of a woman. The more general term "woman" indicates that Christ was born a true man. Paul
does not say that Christ was born of man and woman, but only of woman. That he has a virgin
in mind is obvious.

This passage furthermore declares that Christ's purpose in coming was the abolition of the
Law, not with the intention of laying down new laws, but "to redeem them that were under the
law." Christ himself declared: "I judge no man." (John 8:15.) Again, "I came not to judge the
world, but to save the world." (John 12:47.) In other words: "I came not to bring more laws,
or to judge men according to the existing Law. I have a higher and better office. I came to
judge and to condemn the Law, so that it may no more judge and condemn the world."

How did Christ manage to redeem us? "He was made under the law." When Christ came He found
us all in prison. What did He do about it? Although He was the Lord of the Law, He voluntarily
placed Himself under the Law and permitted it to exercise dominion over Him, indeed to accuse
and to condemn Him. When the Law takes us into judgment it has a perfect right to do so. "For
we are by nature the children of wrath, even as others." (Eph. 2:3.) Christ, however, "did
no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth." (I Pet. 2:22.) Hence the Law had no jurisdiction
over Him. Yet the Law treated this innocent, just, and blessed Lamb of God as cruelly as it
treated us. It accused Him of blasphemy and treason. It made Him guilty of the sins of the
whole world. It overwhelmed him with such anguish of soul that His sweat was as blood. The
Law condemned Him to the shameful death on the Cross.

It is truly amazing that the Law had the effrontery to turn upon its divine Author, and that
without a show of right. For its insolence the Law in turn was arraigned before the judgment
seat of God and condemned. Christ might have overcome the Law by an exercise of His omnipotent
authority over the Law. Instead, He humbled Himself under the Law for and together with them
that were under the Law. He gave the Law license to accuse and condemn Him. His present mastery
over the Law was obtained by virtue of His Sonship and His substitutionary victory.

Thus Christ banished the Law from the conscience. It dare no longer banish us from God. For
that matter,--the Law continues to reveal sin. It still raises its voice in condemnation. But
the conscience finds quick relief in the words of the Apostle: "Christ has redeemed us from
the law." The conscience can now hold its head high and say to the Law: "You are not so holy
yourself. You crucified the Son of God. That was an awful thing for you to do. You have lost
your influence forever."

The words, "Christ was made under the law," are worth all the attention we can bestow on them.
They declare that the Son of God did not only fulfill one or two easy requirements of the Law,
but that He endured all the tortures of the Law. The Law brought all its fright to bear upon
Christ until He experienced anguish and terror such as nobody else ever experienced. His bloody
sweat. His need of angelic comfort, His tremulous prayer in the garden, His lamentation on
the Cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" bear eloquent witness to the sting
of the Law. He suffered "to redeem them that were under the law."

The Roman conception of Christ as a mere lawgiver more stringent than Moses, is quite contrary
to Paul's teaching. Christ, according to Paul, was not an agent of the Law but a patient of
the Law. He was not a law-giver, but a law-taker.

True enough, Christ also taught and expounded the Law. But it was incidental. It was a sideline
with Him. He did not come into the world for the purpose of teaching the Law, as little as
it was the purpose of His coming to perform miracles. Teaching the Law and performing miracles
did not constitute His unique mission to the world. The prophets also taught the Law and performed
miracles. In fact, according to the promise of Christ, the apostles performed greater miracles
than Christ Himself. (John 14:12.) The true purpose of Christ's coming was the abolition of
the Law, of sin, and of death.

If we think of Christ as Paul here depicts Him, we shall never go wrong. We shall never be
in danger of misconstruing the meaning of the Law. We shall understand that the Law does not
justify. We shall understand why a Christian observes laws: For the peace of the world, out
of gratitude to God, and for a good example that others may be attracted to the Gospel.

  VERSE 5. That we might receive the adoption of sons.

Paul still has for his text Genesis 22:18, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed." In the course of his Epistle he calls this promise of the blessing righteousness,
life, deliverance from the Law, the testament, etc. Now he also calls the promise of blessing
"the adoption of sons," the inheritance of everlasting life.

What ever induced God to adopt us for His children and heirs? What claim can men who are subservient
to sin, subject to the curse of the Law, and worthy of everlasting death, have on God and eternal
life? That God adopted us is due to the merit of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who humbled
Himself under the Law and redeemed us law-ridden sinners.

In the early Church the Holy Spirit was sent forth in visible form. He descended upon Christ
in the form of a dove (Matt. 3:16), and in the likeness of fire upon the apostles and other
believers. (Acts 2:3.) This visible outpouring of the Holy Spirit was necessary to the establishment
of the early Church, as were also the miracles that accompanied the gift of the Holy Ghost.
Paul explained the purpose of these miraculous gifts of the Spirit in I Corinthians 14:22,
"Tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not." Once the
Church had been established and properly advertised by these miracles, the visible appearance
of the Holy Ghost ceased.

Next, the Holy Ghost is sent forth into the hearts of the believers, as here stated, "God sent
the Spirit of his Son into your hearts." This sending is accomplished by the preaching of the
Gospel through which the Holy Spirit inspires us with fervor and light, with new judgment,
new desires, and new motives. This happy innovation is not a derivative of reason or personal
development, but solely the gift and operation of the Holy Ghost.

This renewal by the Holy Spirit may not be conspicuous to the world, but it is patent to us
by our better judgment, our improved speech, and our unashamed confession of Christ. Formerly
we did not confess Christ to be our only merit, as we do now in the light of the Gospel. Why,
then, should we feel bad if the world looks upon us as ravagers of religion and insurgents
against constituted authority? We confess Christ and our conscience approves of it. Then, too,
we live in the fear of God. If we sin, we sin not on purpose, but unwittingly, and we are sorry
for it. Sin sticks in our flesh, and the flesh gets us into sin even after we have been imbued
by the Holy Ghost. Outwardly there is no great difference between a Christian and any honest
man. The activities of a Christian are not sensational. He performs his duty according to his
vocation. He takes good care of his family, and is kind and helpful to others. Such homely,
everyday performances are not much admired. But the setting-up exercises of the monks draw
great applause. Holy works, you know. Only the acts of a Christian are truly good and acceptable
to God, because they are done in faith, with a cheerful heart, out of gratitude to Christ.

We ought to have no misgivings about whether the Holy Ghost dwells in us. We are "the temple
of the Holy Ghost." (I Cor. 3:16.) When we have a love for the Word of God, and gladly hear,
talk, write, and think of Christ, we are to know that this inclination toward Christ is the
gift and work of the Holy Ghost. Where you come across contempt for the Word of God, there
is the devil. We meet with such contempt for the Word of God mostly among the common people.
They act as though the Word of God does not concern them. Wherever you find a love for the
Word, thank God for the Holy Spirit who infuses this love into the hearts of men. We never
come by this love naturally, neither can it be enforced by laws. It is the gift of the Holy Spirit.

The Roman theologians teach that no man can know for a certainty whether he stands in the favor
of God or not. This teaching forms one of the chief articles of their faith. With this teaching
they tormented men's consciences, excommunicated Christ from the Church, and limited the operations
of the Holy Ghost.

St. Augustine observed that "every man is certain of his faith, if he has faith." This the
Romanists deny. "God forbid," they exclaim piously, "that I should ever be so arrogant as to
think that I stand in grace, that I am holy, or that I have the Holy Ghost." We ought to feel
sure that we stand in the grace of God, not in view of our own worthiness, but through the
good services of Christ. As certain as we are that Christ pleases God, so sure ought we to
be that we also please God, because Christ is in us. And although we daily offend God by our
sins, yet as often as we sin, God's mercy bends over us. Therefore sin cannot get us to doubt
the grace of God. Our certainty is of Christ, that mighty Hero who overcame the Law, sin, death,
and all evils. So long as He sits at the right hand of God to intercede for us, we have nothing
to fear from the anger of God.

This inner assurance of the grace of God is accompanied by outward indications such as gladly
to hear, preach, praise, and to confess Christ, to do one's duty in the station in which God
has placed us, to aid the needy, and to comfort the sorrowing. These are the affidavits of
the Holy Spirit testifying to our favorable standing with God.

If we could be fully persuaded that we are in the good grace of God, that our sins are forgiven,
that we have the Spirit of Christ, that we are the beloved children of God, we would be ever
so happy and grateful to God. But because we often feel fear and doubt we cannot come to that
happy certainty.

Train your conscience to believe that God approves of you. Fight it out with doubt. Gain assurance
through the Word of God. Say: "I am all right with God. I have the Holy Ghost. Christ, in whom
I do believe, makes me worthy. I gladly hear, read, sing, and write of Him. I would like nothing
better than that Christ's Gospel be known throughout the world and that many, many be brought
to faith in Him."

  VERSE 6. Crying, Abba, Father.

Paul might have written, "God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, calling Abba,
Father." Instead, he wrote, "Crying, Abba, Father." In the eighth chapter of the Epistle to
the Romans the Apostle describes this crying of the Spirit as "groanings which cannot be uttered."

The fact that the Spirit of Christ in our hearts cries unto God and makes intercession for
us with groanings should reassure us greatly. However, there are many factors that prevent
such full reassurance on our part. We are born in sin. To doubt the good will of God is an
inborn suspicion of God with all of us. Besides, the devil, our adversary, goeth about seeking
to devour us by roaring: "God is angry at you and is going to destroy you forever." In all
these difficulties we have only one support, the Gospel of Christ. To hold on to it, that is
the trick. Christ cannot be perceived with the senses. We cannot see Him. The heart does not
feel His helpful presence. Especially in times of trials a Christian feels the power of sin,
the infirmity of his flesh, the goading darts of the devil, the agues of death, the scowl and
judgment of God. All these things cry out against us. The Law scolds us, sin screams at us,
death thunders at us, the devil roars at us. In the midst of the clamor the Spirit of Christ
cries in our hearts: "Abba, Father." And this little cry of the Spirit transcends the hullabaloo
of the Law, sin, death, and the devil, and finds a hearing with God.

The Spirit cries in us because of our weakness. Because of our infirmity the Holy Ghost is
sent forth into our hearts to pray for us according to the will of God and to assure us of
the grace of God.

Let the Law, sin, and the devil cry out against us until their outcry fills heaven and earth. But
to do that would have been but has the idiom could not be for destruction. To singularity, and
may not claim of resurrection of Paul but Paul, whom look themselves

 The
monasteries recruit the youth on the plea that their "holy" orders will assuredly recruit them
for heaven. But once inside the monastery the recruits are told to doubt the promises of God.
(Eccles. 9:1.) They take this hatred to mean the wrath of God to come. Others take it to mean
God's present anger. None of them seem to understand this passage from Solomon. On every page
the Scriptures urge us to believe that God is merciful, loving, and patient; that He is faithful
and true, and that He keeps His promises. All the promises of God were fulfilled in the gift
of His only- begotten Son, that "whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life." The Gospel is reassurance for sinners. Yet this one saying from Solomon, misinterpreted
at that, is made to count for more than all the many promises of all the Scriptures.

If our opponents are so uncertain about their status with God, and even go so far as to say
that the conscience ought to be kept in a state of doubt, why is it that they persecute us
as vile heretics? When it comes to persecuting us they do not seem to be in doubt and uncertainty
one minute.

Let us not fail to thank God for delivering us from the doctrine of doubt. The Gospel commands
us to look away from our own good works to the promises of God in Christ, the Mediator. The
pope commands us to look away from the promises of God in Christ to our own merit. No wonder
they are the eternal prey of doubt and despair. We depend upon God for salvation. No wonder
that our doctrine is certified, because it does not rest in our own strength, our own conscience,
our own feelings, our own person, our own works. It is built on a better foundation. It is
built on the promises and truth of God.

Besides, the passage from Solomon does not treat of the hatred and love of God towards men.
It merely rebukes the ingratitude of men. The more deserving a person is, the less he is appreciated.
Often those who should be his best friends, are his worst enemies. Those who least deserve
the praise of the world, get most. David was a holy man and a good king. Nevertheless he was
chased from his own country. The prophets, Christ, the apostles, were slain. Solomon in this
passage does not speak of the love and hatred of God, but of love and hatred among men. As
though Solomon wanted to say: "There are many good and wise men whom God uses for the advancement
of mankind. Seldom, if ever, are their efforts crowned with gratitude. They are usually repaid
with hatred and ingratitude."

We are being treated that way. We thought we would find favor with men for bringing them the
Gospel of peace, life, and eternal salvation. Instead of favor, we found fury. At first, yes,
many were delighted with our doctrine and received it gladly. We counted them as our friends
and brethren, and were happy to think that they would help us in sowing the seed of the Gospel.
But they revealed themselves as false brethren and deadly enemies of the Gospel. If you experience
the ingratitude of men, don't let it get you down. Say with Christ: "They hated me without
cause." And, "For my love they are my adversaries; but I give myself unto prayer." (Ps. 109:4.)

Let us never doubt the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, but make up our minds that God is pleased
with us, that He looks after us, and that we have the Holy Spirit who prays for us.

  VERSE 7. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son.

This sentence clinches Paul's argument. He says: "With the Holy Spirit in our hearts crying,
'Abba, Father,' there can be no doubt that God has adopted us for His children and that our
subjection to the Law has come to an end." We are now the free children of God. We may now
say to the Law: "Mister Law, you have lost your throne to Christ. I am free now and a son of
God. You cannot curse me any more." Do not permit the Law to lie in your conscience. Your conscience
belongs to Christ. Let Christ be in it and not the Law.

As the children of God we are the heirs of His eternal heaven. What a wonderful gift heaven
is, man's heart cannot conceive, much less describe. Until we enter upon our heavenly inheritance
we are only to have our little faith to go by. To man's reason our faith looks rather forlorn.
But because our faith rests on the promises of the infinite God, His promises are also infinite,
so much so that nothing can accuse or condemn us.

  VERSE 7. And if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

A son is an heir, not by virtue of high accomplishments, but by virtue of his birth. He is
a mere recipient. His birth makes him an heir, not his labors. In exactly the same way we obtain
the eternal gifts of righteousness, resurrection, and everlasting life. We obtain them not
as agents, but as beneficiaries. We are the children and heirs of God through faith in Christ.
We have Christ to thank for everything.

We are not the heirs of some rich and mighty man, but heirs of God, the almighty Creator of
all things. If a person could fully appreciate what it means to be a son and heir of God, he
would rate the might and wealth of nations small change in comparison with his heavenly inheritance.
What is the world to him who has heaven? No wonder Paul greatly desired to depart and to be
with Christ. Nothing would be more welcome to us than early death, knowing that it would spell
the end of all our miseries and the beginning of all our happiness. Yes, if a person could
perfectly believe this he would not long remain alive. The anticipation of his joy would kill him.

But the law of the members strives against the law of the mind, and makes perfect joy and faith
impossible. We need the continued help and comfort of the Holy Spirit. We need His prayers.
Paul himself cried out: "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?" The body of this death spoiled the joy of his spirit. He did not always entertain the
sweet and glad expectation of his heavenly inheritance. He often felt miserable.

This goes to show how hard it is to believe. Faith is feeble, because the flesh wars against
the spirit. If we could have perfect faith, our loathing for this life in the world would be
complete. We would not be so careful about this life. We would not be so attached to the world
and the things of the world. We would not feel so good when we have them; we would not feel
so bad when we lose them. We would be far more humble and patient and kind. But our faith is
weak, because our spirit is weak. In this life we can have only the first- fruits of the Spirit,
as Paul says.

  VERSE 7. Through Christ.

The Apostle always has Christ on the tip of his tongue. He foresaw that nothing would be less
known in the world some day than the Gospel of Christ. Therefore he talks of Christ continually.
As often as he speaks of righteousness, grace, the promise, the adoption, and the inheritance
of heaven, he adds the words, "In Christ," or "Through Christ," to show that these blessings
are not to be had by the Law, or the deeds of the Law, much less by our own exertions, or by
the observance of human traditions, but only by and through and in Christ.

  VERSES 8 and 9. Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service
  unto them which by nature are no gods.

This concludes Paul's discourse on justification. From now to the end of the Epistle the Apostle
writes mostly of Christian conduct. But before he follows up his doctrinal discourse with practical
precepts he once more reproves the Galatians. He is deeply displeased with them for relinquishing
their divine doctrine. He tells them: "You have taken on teachers who intend to recommit you
to the Law. By my doctrine I called you out of the darkness of ignorance into the wonderful
light of the knowledge of God. I led you out of bondage into the freedom of the sons of God,
not by the prescription of laws, but by the gift of heavenly and eternal blessings through
Christ Jesus. How could you so soon forsake the light and return to darkness? How could you
so quickly stray from grace into the Law, from freedom into bondage?"

The example of the Galatians, of Anabaptists, and other sectarians in our day bears testimony
to the ease with which faith may be lost. We take great pains in setting forth the doctrine
of faith by preaching and by writing. We are careful to apply the Gospel and the Law in their
proper turn. Yet we make little headway because the devil seduces people into misbelief by
taking Christ out of their sight and focusing their eyes upon the Law.

But why does Paul accuse the Galatians of reverting to the weak and beggarly elements of the
Law when they never had the Law? Why does he not say to them: "At one time you Galatians did
not know God. You then served idols that were no gods. But now that you have come to know the
true God, why do you go back to the worship of idols?" Paul seems to identify their defection
from the Gospel to the Law with their former idolatry. Indeed he does. Whoever gives up the
article of justification does not know the true God. It is one and the same thing whether a
person reverts to the Law or to the worship of idols. When the article of justification is
lost, nothing remains except error, hypocrisy, godlessness, and idolatry. Christ is the only
means whereby we can know God and His will. In Christ we perceive that God is not a cruel judge,
but a most loving and merciful Father who to bless and to save us "spared not his own Son,
but gave him up for us all." This is truly to know God.

Those who do not know God in Christ arrive at this erroneous conclusion: "I will serve God
in such and such a way. I will join this or that order. I will be active in this or that charitable
endeavor. God will sanction my good intentions and reward me with everlasting life. For is
He not a merciful and generous Father who gives good things even to the unworthy and ungrateful?
How much more will He grant unto me everlasting life as a due payment in return for my many
good deeds and merits." This is the religion of reason. This is the natural religion of the
world. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God. (I Cor. 2:14.) "There
is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God." (Romans 3:11.) Hence, there
is really no difference between a Jew, a Mohammedan, and any other old or new heretic. There
may be a difference of persons, places, rites, religions, ceremonies, but as far as their fundamental
beliefs are concerned they are all alike.

Is it therefore not extreme folly for Rome and the Mohammedans to fight each other about religion?
How about the monks? Why should one monk want to be accounted more holy than another monk because
of some silly ceremony, when all the time their basic beliefs are asmuch alike as one egg is
like the other? They all imagine, if we do this or that work, God will have mercy on us; if
not, God will be angry.

God never promised to save anybody for his religious observance of ceremonies and ordinances.
Those who rely upon such things do serve a god, but it is their own invention of a god, and
not the true God. The true God has this to say: No religion pleases Me whereby the Father is
not glorified through His Son Jesus. All who give their faith to this Son of Mine, to them
I am God and Father. I accept, justify, and save them. All others abide under My curse because
they worship creatures instead of Me.

Without the doctrine of justification there can be only ignorance of God. Those who refuse
to be justified by Christ are idolaters. They remain under the Law, sin, death, and the power
of the devil. Everything they do is wrong.

Nowadays there are many such idolaters who want to be counted among the true confessors of
the Gospel. They may even teach that men are delivered from their sins by the death of Christ.
But because they attach more importance to charity than to faith in Christ they dishonor Him
and pervert His Word. They do not serve the true God, but an idol of their own invention. The
true God has never yet smiled upon a person for his charity or virtues, but only for the sake
of Christ's merits.

The objection is frequently raised that the Bible commands that we should love God with all
our heart. True enough. But because God commands it, it does not follow that we do it. If we
could love God with all our heart we should undoubtedly be justified by our obedience, for
it is written, "Which if a man do, he shall live in them." (Lev. 18:5.) But now comes the Gospel
and says: "Because you do not do these things, you cannot live in them." The words, "Thou shalt
love the Lord, thy God," require perfect obedience, perfect fear, perfect trust, and perfect
love. But where are the people who can render perfection? Hence, this commandment, instead
of justifying men, only accuses and condemns them. "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness
to every one that believeth" (Romans 10:1.)

How may these two contradictory statements of the Apostle, "Ye knew not God," and "Ye worshipped
God," be reconciled? I answer: By nature all men know that there is a God, "because that which
may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible
things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen." (Romans 1:19, 20.) Furthermore,
the different religions to be found among all nations at all times bear witness to the fact
that all men have a certain intuitive knowledge of God.

If all men know God how can Paul say that the Galatians did not know God prior to the hearing
of the Gospel? I answer: There is a twofold knowledge of God, general and particular. All men
have the general and instinctive recognition that there is a God who created heaven and earth,
who is just and holy, and who punishes the wicked. How God feels about us, what His intentions
are, what He will do for us, or how He will save us, that men cannot know instinctively. It
must be revealed to them. I may know a person by sight, and still not know him, because I do
not know how he feels about me. Men know instinctively that there is a God. But what His will
is toward them, they do not know. It is written: "There is none that understandeth God." (Romans
3:11.) Again, "No man hath seen God." (John 1:18.) Now, what good does it do you if you know
that there is a God, if you do not know how He feels about you, or what He wants of you? People
have done a good deal of guessing. The Jew imagines he is doing the will of God if he concentrates
on the Law of Moses. The Mohammedan thinks his Koran is the will of God. The monk fancies he
is doing the will of God if he performs his vows. But they deceive themselves and become "vain
in their imaginations," as Paul says, Romans 1:21. Instead of worshipping the true God, they
worship the vain imaginations of their foolish hearts.

What Paul means by saying to the Galatians, "When ye knew not God," is simply this: "There
was a time when you did not know the will of God in Christ, but you worshipped gods of your
own invention, thinking that you had to perform this or that labor." Whether you understand
the "elements of the world" to mean the Law of Moses, or the religions of the heathen nations,
it makes no difference. Those who lapse from the Gospel to the Law are no better off than those
who lapse from grace into idolatry. Without Christ all religion is idolatry. Without Christ
men will entertain false ideas about God, call their ideas what you like, the laws of Moses,
the ordinances of the Pope, the Koran of the Mohammedans, or what have you.

  VERSE 9. But now, after that ye have known God.

"Is it not amazing," cries Paul, "that you Galatians who knew God intimately by the hearing
of the Gospel, should all of a sudden revert from the true knowledge of His will in which I
thought you were confirmed, to the weak and beggarly elements of the Law which can only enslave
you again?"

  VERSE 9. Or rather are known of God.

The Apostle turns the foregoing sentence around. He fears the Galatians have lost God altogether.
"Alas," he cries, "have you come to this, that you no longer know God? What else am I to think?
Nevertheless, God knows you." Our knowledge of God is rather passive than active. God knows
us better than we know God. "Ye are known of God" means that God brings His Gospel to our attention,
and endows us with faith and the Holy Spirit. Even in these words the Apostle denies the possibility
of our knowing God by the performance of the Law. "No man knoweth who the Father is, but the
Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him." (Luke 10:22.) "By his knowledge shall my righteous
servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities." (Isaiah 53:11.)

The Apostle frankly expresses his surprise to the Galatians that they who had known God intimately
through the Gospel, should so easily be persuaded by the false apostles to return to the weak
and beggarly elements of the Law. I would not be surprised to see my church perverted by some
fanatic through one or two sermons. We are no better than the apostles who had to witness the
subversion of the churches which they had planted with their own hands. Nevertheless, Christ
will reign to the end of the world, and that miraculously, as He did during the Dark Ages.

Paul seems to think rather ill of the Law. He calls it the elements of the world, the weak
and beggarly elements of the world. Was it not irreverent for him to speak that way about the
holy Law of God? The Law ought to prepare the way of Christ into the hearts of men. That is
the true purpose and function of the Law. But if the Law presumes to usurp the place and function
of the Gospel, it is no longer the holy Law of God, but a pseudo-Gospel.

If you care to amplify this matter you may add the observation that the Law is a weak and beggarly
element because it makes people weak and beggarly. The Law has no power and affluence to make
men strong and rich before God. To seek to be justified by the Law amounts to the same thing
as if a person who is already weak and feeble should try to find strength in weakness, or as
if a person with the dropsy should seek a cure by exposing himself to the pestilence, or as
if a leper should go to a leper, and a beggar to a beggar to find health and wealth.

Those who seek to be justified by the Law grow weaker and more destitute right along. They
are weak and bankrupt to begin with. They are by nature the children of wrath. Yet for salvation
they grasp at the straw of the Law. The Law can only aggravate their weakness and poverty.
The Law makes them ten times weaker and poorer than they were before.

I and many others have experienced the truth of this. I have known monks who zealously labored
to please God for salvation, but the more they labored the more impatient, miserable, uncertain,
and fearful they became. What else can you expect? You cannot grow strong through weakness
and rich through poverty. People who prefer the Law to the Gospel are like Aesop's dog who
let go of the meat to snatch at the shadow of the water. There is no satisfaction in the Law.
What satisfaction can there be in collecting laws with which to torment oneself and others?
One law breeds ten more until their number is legion.

Who would have thought it possible that the Galatians, taught as they were by that efficient
apostle and teacher, Paul, could so quickly be led astray by the false apostles? To fall away
from the Gospel is an easy matter because few people appreciate what an excellent treasure
the knowledge of Christ really is. People are not sufficiently exercised in their faith by
afflictions. They do not wrestle against sin. They live in security without conflict. Because
they have never been tried in the furnace of affliction they are not properly equipped with
the armor of God and know not how to use the sword of the Spirit. As long as they are being
shepherded by faithful pastors, all is well. But when their faithful shepherds are gone and
wolves disguised as sheep break into the fold, back they go to the weak and beggarly elements
of the Law.

Whoever goes back to the Law loses the knowledge of the truth, fails in the recognition of
his sinfulness, does not know God, nor the devil, nor himself, and does not understand the
meaning and purpose of the Law. Without the knowledge of Christ a man will always argue that
the Law is necessary for salvation, that it will strengthen the weak and enrich the poor. Wherever
this opinion holds sway the promises of God are denied, Christ is demoted, hypocrisy and idolatry
are established.

  VERSE 9. Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage.

The Apostle pointedly asks the Galatians whether they desire to be in bondage again to the
Law. The Law is weak and poor, the sinner is weak and poor--two feeble beggars trying to help
each other. They cannot do it. They only wear each other out. But through Christ a weak and
poor sinner is revived and enriched unto eternal life.

  VERSE 10. Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

The Apostle Paul knew what the false apostles were teaching the Galatians: The observance of
days, and months, and times, and years. The Jews had been obliged to keep holy the Sabbath
Day, the new moons, the feast of the passover, the feast of tabernacles, and other feasts.
The false apostles constrained the Galatians to observe these Jewish feasts under threat of
damnation. Paul hastens to tell the Galatians that they were exchanging their Christian liberty
for the weak and beggarly elements of the world.

  VERSE 11. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in
  vain.

It grieves the Apostle to think that he might have preached the Gospel to the Galatians in
vain. But this statement expresses more than grief. Behind his apparent disappointment at their
failure lurks the sharp reprimand that they had forsaken Christ and that they were proving
themselves to be obstinate unbelievers. Brooke Christ, state. Kayan has rejected the northerly darker surface.

 In Philippians 3:20, the Apostle uses the phrase: "Our conversation
is in heaven," not locally in heaven, but in spirit. When a believer accepts the heavenly gifts
of the Gospel he is in heaven. So also in Ephesians 1:3, "Who hath blessed us with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly places in Christ." Jerusalem here means the universal Christian Church
on earth.

Sarah, the Church, as the bride of Christ bears free children who are not subject to the Law.

  VERSE 27.

Paul quotes the allegorical prophecy of Isaiah to the effect that the mother of many children
must die desolately, while the barren woman shall have an abundance of children. (Isaiah 54:1.)
He applies this prophecy to Hagar and Sarah, to the Law and the Gospel. The Law as the husband
of the fruitful woman procreates many children. For men of all ages have had the idea that
they are right when they follow after the Law and outwardly perform its requirements.

Although the Law has many children, they are not free. They are slaves. As servants they cannot
have a share in the inheritance, but are driven from the house as Ishmael was cast out of the
house of Abraham. In fact the servants of the Law are even now barred from the kingdom of light
and liberty, for "he that believeth not, is condemned already." (John 3:18.) As the servants
of the Law they remain under the curse of the Law, under sin and death, under the power of
the devil, and under the wrath and judgment of God.

On the other hand, Sarah, the free Church, seems barren. The Gospel of the Cross which the
Church proclaims does not have the appeal that the Law has for men, and therefore it does not
find many adherents. The Church does not look prosperous. Unbelievers have always predicted
the death of the Church. The Jews were quite certain that the Church would not long endure.
They said to Paul: "As concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against."
(Acts 28:22.) No matter how barren and forsaken, how weak and desolate the Church may seem,
she alone is really fruitful before God. By the Gospel she procreates an infinite number of
children that are free heirs of everlasting life.

The Law, "the old husband," is really dead. But not all people know it, or want to know it.
They labor and bear the burden and the heat of the day, and bring forth many children, children
that are bastards like themselves, children born to be put out of the house like Ishmael to
perish forever. Accursed be that doctrine, life, and religion which endeavors to obtain righteousness
before God by the Law and its creeds.

The scholastics think that the judicial and ceremonial laws of Moses were abolished by the
coming of Christ, but not the moral law. They are blind. When Paul declares that we are delivered
from the curse of the Law he means the whole Law, particularly the moral law which more than
the other laws accuses, curses, and condemns the conscience. The Ten Commandments have no right
to condemn that conscience in which Jesus dwells, for Jesus has taken from the Ten Commandments
the right and power to curse us.

Not as if the conscience is now insensitive to the terrors of the Law, but the Law cannot drive
the conscience to despair. "There is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."
That is right. You cannot do a thing to be delivered from the tyranny of the Law. But listen
to the glad tidings which the Holy Ghost brings to you in the words of the prophet: "Rejoice,
thou barren." As Christ is greater than the Law, so much more excellent is the righteousness
of Christ than the righteousness of the Law.

In one more respect the Law has been abolished. The civil laws of Moses do not concern us,
and should not be put back in force. That does not mean that we are exempt from obedience to
the civil laws under which we live. On the contrary, the Gospel commands Christians to obey
government "not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake." (Romans 13:5.)

Neither do the ordinances of Moses or those of the Pope concern us. But because life cannot
go on without some ordinances, the Gospel permits regulations to be made in the Church in regard
to special days, times, places, etc., in order that the people may know upon what day, at what
hour, and in what place to assemble for the Word of God. Such directions are desirable that
"all things be done decently and in order." (I Cor. 14:40.) These directions may be changed
or omitted altogether, as long as no offense is given to the weak.

Paul, however, refers particularly to the abolition of the moral law. If faith alone in Christ
justifies, then the whole Law is abolished without exception. And this the Apostle proves by
the testimony of Isaiah, who bids the barren to rejoice because she will have many children,
whereas she that has a husband and many children will be forsaken.

Isaiah calls the Church barren because her children are born without effort by the Word of
faith through the Spirit of God. It is a matter of birth, not of exertion. The believer too
works, but not in an effort to become a son and an heir of God. He is that before he goes to
work. He is born a son and an heir. He works for the glory of God and the welfare of his fellowmen.

  VERSE 28. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

The Jews claimed to be the children of God because they were the children of Abraham. And in
verse 42: "If God were your Father, ye would love me." In other words: "You are not the children
of God. If you were, you would know and love me. Brothers born and living together in the same
house recognize each other. You do not recognize me. You are of your father, the devil."

We are not like these Jews, the children of the bondwoman, the Law, who were cast out of the
house by Jesus. We are children of the promise like Isaac, born of grace and faith unto an
everlasting inheritance.

  VERSE 29. But as that he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
  that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

This is a cheering thought. We who are born of the Gospel, and live in Christ, and rejoice
in our inheritance, have Ishmael for our enemy. The children of the Law will always persecute
the children of the Gospel. This is our daily experience. Our opponents tell us that everything
was at peace before the Gospel was revived by us. Since then the whole world has been upset.
People blame us and the Gospel for everything, for the disobedience of subjects to their rulers,
for wars, plagues, and famines, for revolutions, and every other evil that can be imagined.
No wonder our opponents think they are doing God a favor by hating and persecuting us. Ishmael
will persecute Isaac.

We invite our opponents to tell us what good things attended the preaching of the Gospel by
the apostles. Did not the destruction of Jerusalem follow on the heels of the Gospel? And how
about the overthrow of the Roman Empire? Did not the whole world seethe with unrest as the
Gospel was preached in the whole world? We do not say that the Gospel instigated these upheavals.
The iniquity of man did it.

Our opponents blame our doctrine for the present turmoil. But ours is a doctrine of grace and
peace. It does not stir up trouble. Trouble starts when the people, the nations and their rulers
of the earth rage and take counsel together against the Lord, and against His anointed. (Psalm
2.) But all their counsels shall be brought to naught. "He that sitteth in the heavens shall
laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision." (Psalm 2:4.) Let them cry out against us as much
as they like. We know that they are the cause of all their own troubles.

As long as we preach Christ and confess Him to be our Savior, we must be content to be called
vicious trouble makers. "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar," so said the Jews of Paul and Silas. (Acts
17:6, 7.) Of Paul they said: "We have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition
among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes." The
Gentiles uttered similar complaints: "These men do exceedingly trouble our city."

This man Luther is also accused of being a pestilent fellow who troubles the papacy and the
Roman empire. If I would keep silent, all would be well, and the Pope would no more persecute
me. The moment I open my mouth the Pope begins to fume and to rage. It seems we must choose
between Christ and the Pope. Let the Pope perish.

Christ foresaw the reaction of the world to the Gospel. He said: "I am come to send fire on
the earth, and what will I, if it be already kindled?" (Luke 12:49.)

Do not take the statement of our opponents seriously, that no good can come of the preaching
of the Gospel. What do they know? They would not recognize the fruits of the Gospel if they
saw them.

At any rate, our opponents cannot accuse us of adultery, murder, theft, and such crimes. The
worst they can say about us is that we have the Gospel. What is wrong with the Gospel? We teach
that Christ, the Son of God, has redeemed us from sin and everlasting death. This is not our
doctrine. It belongs to Christ. If there is anything wrong with it, it is not our fault. If
they want to condemn Christ for being our Savior and Redeemer, that is their lookout. We are
mere onlookers, watching to see who will win the victory, Christ or His opponents. I am the
one for whose sake you are killed. If you did not confess my name, the world would not hate
you. The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute
you."

Christ takes all the blame. He says: "You have not incurred the hatred and persecutions of
the world. I have. But be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."

  VERSE 30.

Sarah's demand that the bondwoman and her son be cast out of the house was undoubtedly a blow
to Abraham. He felt sorry for his son Ishmael. The Scripture explicitly states Abraham's grief
in the words: "And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son." (Gen.
21:12.)

The Holy Ghost contemptuously calls the admirers of the Law the children of the bondwoman.
"If you do not know your mother, I will tell you what kind of a woman she is. She is a slave.
And you are slaves. You are slaves of the Law and therefore slaves of sin, death, and everlasting
damnation. You are not fit to be heirs. You are put out of the house."

This is the sentence which God pronounces upon the Ishmaelites, the papists, and all others
who trust in their own merits, and persecute the Church of Christ. Because they are slaves
and persecutors of the children of the free woman, they shall be cast out of the house of God
forever. They shall have no inheritance with the children of the promise. This sentence stands
forever.

This sentence affects not only those popes, cardinals bishops, and monks who were notoriously
wicked and made their bellies their Gods. It strikes, also, those who lived in all sincerity
to please God and to merit the forgiveness of their sins through a life of self-denial. Even
these will be cast out, because they are children of the bondwoman.

Our opponents do not defend their own moral delinquency. The better ones deplore and abhor
it. But they defend and uphold their doctrine of works which is of the devil. Our quarrel is
not with those who live in manifest sins. Our quarrel is with those among them who think they
live like angels, claiming that they do not only perform the Ten Commandments of God, but also
the sayings of Christ, and many good works that God does not expect of them. We quarrel with
them because they refuse to have Jesus' merit count alone for righteousness.

St. Bernard was one of the best of the medieval saints. He lived a chaste and holy life. But
when it came to dying he did not trust in his chaste life for salvation. He prayed: "I have
lived a wicked life. But Thou, Lord Jesus, hast a heaven to give unto me. First, because Thou
art the Son of God. Secondly, because Thou hast purchased heaven for me by Thy suffering and
death. Thou givest heaven to me, not because I earned it, but because Thou hast earned it for
me." If any of the Romanists are saved it is because they forget their good deeds and merits
and feel like Paul: "Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which
is through the faith of Christ." (Phil. 3:9.)

  VERSE 31. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
  of the free.

With this sentence the Apostle Paul concludes his allegory of the barren Church. This sentence
forms a clear rejection of the righteousness of the Law and a confirmation of the doctrine
of justification. In the next chapter Paul lays special stress upon the freedom which the children
of the free woman enjoy. He treats of Christian liberty, the knowledge of which is very necessary.
The liberty which Christ purchased for us is a bulwark to us in our battle against spiritual
tyranny. Therefore we must carefully study this doctrine of Christian liberty, not only for
the confirmation of the doctrine of justification, but also for the comfort and encouragement
of those who are weak in faith.

                                  CHAPTER 5

IN this chapter the Apostle Paul presents the doctrine of Christian liberty in a final effort
to persuade the Galatians to give up the nefarious doctrine of the false apostles. To accomplish
his purpose he adduces threats and promises, trying in every way possible to keep them in the
liberty which Christ purchased for them.

"Be steadfast, not careless. Lie not down and sleep, but stand up. Be watchful. Hold fast the
liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free." Those who loll cannot keep this liberty. Satan
hates the light of the Gospel. When it begins to shine a little he fights against it with might
and main.

What liberty does Paul mean? Not civil liberty (for which we have the government to thank),
but the liberty which Christ has procured for us.

At one time the emperor was compelled to grant to the bishop of Rome certain immunities and
privileges. This is civil liberty. That liberty exempts the clergy from certain public charges.
Then there is also another kind of "liberty," when people obey neither the laws of God nor
the laws of men, but do as they please. This carnal liberty the people want in our day. We
are not now speaking of this liberty. Neither are we speaking of civil liberty.

Paul is speaking of a far better liberty, the liberty "wherewith Christ hath made us free,"
not from material bonds, not from the Babylonian captivity, not from the tyranny of the Turks,
but from the eternal wrath of God.

Where is this liberty?

In the conscience.

Our conscience is free and quiet because it no longer has to fear the wrath of God. This is
real liberty, compared with which every other kind of liberty is not worth mentioning. Who
can adequately express the boon that comes to a person when he has the heart-assurance that
God will nevermore be angry with him, but will forever be merciful to him for Christ's sake?
This is indeed a marvelous liberty, to have the sovereign God for our Friend and Father who
will defend, maintain, and save us in this life and in the life to come.

As an outgrowth of this liberty, we are at the same time free from the Law, sin, death, the
power of the devil, hell, etc. Since the wrath of God has been assuaged by Christ no Law, sin,
or death may now accuse and condemn us. These foes of ours will continue to frighten us, but
not too much. The worth of our Christian liberty cannot be exaggerated.

Our conscience must he trained to fall back on the freedom purchased for us by Christ. (Isa. 54:8.)

We shall appreciate this liberty all the more when we bear in mind that it was Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who purchased it with His own blood. Hence, Christ's liberty is given us not
by the Law, or for our own righteousness, but freely for Christ's sake. In the eighth chapter
of the Gospel of St. John, Jesus declares: "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed." He only stands between us and the evils which trouble and afflict us and which He
has overcome for us.

Reason cannot properly evaluate this gift. Who can fully appreciate the blessing of the forgiveness
of sins and of everlasting life? Our opponents claim that they also possess this liberty. But
they do not. When they are put to the test all their self-confidence slips from them. What
else can they expect when they trust in works and not in the Word of God?

Our liberty is founded on Christ Himself, who sits at the right hand of God and intercedes
for us. Therefore our liberty is sure and valid as long as we believe in Christ. As long as
we cling to Him with a steadfast faith we possess His priceless gifts. But if we are careless
and indifferent we shall lose them. It is not without good reason that Paul urges us to watch
and to stand fast. He knew that the devil delights in taking this liberty away from us.

  VERSE 1. And be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

Because reason prefers the righteousness of the Law to the righteousness of faith, Paul calls
the Law a yoke, a yoke of bondage. Peter also calls it a yoke. (Acts 15:10.)

In this passage Paul again disparages the pernicious notion that the Law is able to make men
righteous before God, a notion deeply rooted in man's reason. All mankind is so wrapped up
in this idea that it is hard to drag it out of people. Paul compares those who seek to be justified
by the Law to oxen that are hitched to the yoke. Like oxen that toil in the yoke all day, and
in the evening are turned out to graze along the dusty road, and at last are marked for slaughter
when they no longer can draw the burden, so those who seek to be justified by the Law are "entangled
with the yoke of bondage," and when they have grown old and broken-down in the service of the
Law they have earned for their perpetual reward God's wrath and everlasting torment.

We are not now treating of an unimportant matter. It is a matter that involves everlasting
liberty or everlasting slavery. For as a liberation from God's wrath through the kind office
of Christ is not a passing boon, but a permanent blessing, so also the yoke of the Law is not
a temporary but an everlasting affliction.

Rightly are the doers of the Law called devil's martyrs. They take more pains to earn hell
than the martyrs of Christ to obtain heaven. Theirs is a double misfortune. First they torture
themselves on earth with self- inflicted penances and finally when they die they gain the reward
of eternal damnation.

  VERSE 2. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
  shall profit you nothing.

Paul is incensed at the thought of the tyranny of the Law. His antagonism to the Law is a personal
matter with him. "Behold, I, Paul," he says, "I who have received the Gospel not from men,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ: I who have been commissioned from above to preach the
Gospel to you: I Paul say to you, If you submit to circumcision Christ will profit you nothing."
Paul emphatically declares that for the Galatians to be circumcised would mean for them to
lose the benefits of Christ's suffering and death. This passage may well serve as a criterion
for all the religions. To teach that besides faith in Christ other devices like works, or the
observance of rules, traditions, or ceremonies are necessary for the attainment of righteousness
and everlasting life, is to make Christ and His salvation of no benefit to anybody.

This passage is an indictment of the whole papacy. All priests, monks, and nuns--and I am now
speaking of the best of them--who repose their hope for salvation in their own works, and not
in Christ, whom they imagine to he an angry judge, hear this sentence pronounced against them
that Christ shall profit them nothing. If one can earn the forgiveness of sins and everlasting
life through one's own efforts to what purpose was Christ born? What was the purpose of His
suffering and death, His resurrection, His victory over sin, death, and the devil, if men may
overcome these evils by their own endeavor? Tongue cannot express, nor heart conceive what
a terrible thing it is to make Christ worthless.

The person who is not moved by these considerations to leave the Law and the confidence in
his own righteousness for the liberty in Christ, has a heart that is harder than stone and iron.

Paul does not condemn circumcision in itself. Circumcision is not injurious to the person who
does not ascribe any particular importance to it. Neither are works injurious provided a person
does not attach any saving value to them. The Apostle does not say that works are objectionable,
but to build one's hopes for righteousness on works is disastrous, for that makes Christ good
for nothing.

Let us bear this in mind when the devil accuses our conscience. When that dragon accuses us
of having done no good at all, but only evil, say to him: "You trouble me with the remembrance
of my past sins; you remind me that I have done no good. But this does not bother me, because
if I were to trust in my own good deeds, or despair because I have done no good deeds, Christ
would profit me neither way. I am not going to make him unprofitable to me. This I would do,
if I should presume to purchase for myself the favor of God and everlasting life by my good
deeds, or if I should despair of my salvation because of my sins."

  VERSE 3. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
  is a debtor to do the whole law.

The first fault with circumcision is that it makes Christ unprofitable. The second fault is
that it obligates those who are circumcised to observe the whole Law. Paul is so very much
in earnest about this matter that he confirms it with an oath. "I testify," he says, "I swear
by the living God." Paul's statement may be explained negatively to mean: "I testify to every
man who is being circumcised that he cannot perform the Law in any point. In the very act of
circumcision he is not being circumcised, and in the very act of fulfilling the Law he fulfills
it not." This seems to be the simple meaning of Paul's statement. Later on in the sixth chapter
he explicitly states, "They themselves which are circumcised keep not the law. The fact that
you are circumcised does not mean you are righteous and free from the Law. The truth is that
by circumcision you have become debtors and servants of the Law. The more you endeavor to perform
the Law, the more you will become tangled up in the yoke of the Law."

The truth of this I have experienced in myself and in others. I have seen many work themselves
down to the bones in their hungry effort to obtain peace of conscience. But the harder they
tried the more they worried. Especially in the presence of death they were so uneasy that I
have seen murderers die with better grace and courage.

This holds true also in regard to the church regulations. When I was a monk I tried ever so
hard to live up to the strict rules of my order. I used to make a list of my sins, and I was
always on the way to confession, and whatever penances were enjoined upon me I performed religiously.
In spite of it all, my conscience was always in a fever of doubt. The more I sought to help
my poor stricken conscience the worse it got. The more I paid attention to the regulations
the more I transgressed them.

Hence those that seek to be justified by the Law are much further away from the righteousness
of life than the publicans, sinners, and harlots. They know better than to trust in their own
works. They know that they cannot ever hope to obtain forgiveness by their sins.

Paul's statement in this verse may be taken to mean that those who submit to circumcision are
thereby submitting to the whole Law. To obey Moses in one point requires obedience to him in
all points. It does no good to say that only circumcision is necessary, and not the rest of
Moses' laws. The same reasons that obligate a person to accept circumcision also obligate a
person to accept the whole Law. Thus to acknowledge the Law is tantamount to declaring that
Christ is not yet come. And if Christ is not yet come, then all the Jewish ceremonies and laws
concerning meats, places, and times are still in force, and Christ must be awaited as one who
is still to come. The whole Scripture, however, testifies that Christ has come, that by His
death He has abolished the Law, and that He has fulfilled all things which the prophets have
foretold about Him.

Some would like to subjugate us to certain parts of the Mosaic Law. But this is not to be permitted
under any circumstances. If we permit Moses to rule over us in one thing, we must obey him
in all things.

Paul in this verse discloses that he is not speaking so much of circumcision as the trust which
men repose in the outward act. We can hear him say: "I do not condemn the Law in itself; what
I condemn is that men seek to be justified by the Law, as if Christ were still to come, or
as if He alone were unable to justify sinners. It is this that I condemn, because it makes
Christ of no effect. It makes you void of Christ so that Christ is not in you, nor can you
be partakers of the knowledge, the spirit, the fellowship, the liberty, the life, or the achievements
of Christ. You are completely separated from Him, so much so that He has nothing to do with
you any more, or for that matter you with Him." Can anything worse be said against the Law?
If you think Christ and the Law can dwell together in your heart, you may be sure that Christ
dwells not in your heart. For if Christ is in your heart He neither condemns you, nor does
He ever bid you to trust in your own good works. If you know Christ at all, you know that good
works do not serve unto righteousness, nor evil works unto condemnation. I do not want to withhold
from good works their due praise, nor do I wish to encourage evil works. But when it comes
to justification, I say, we must concentrate upon Christ alone, or else we make Him non-effective
.You must choose between Christ and the righteousness of the Law. If you choose Christ you
are righteous before God. If you stick to the Law, Christ is of no use to you.

  VERSE 4. Ye are fallen from grace.

That means you are no longer in the kingdom or condition of grace. When a person on board ship
falls into the sea and is drowned it makes no difference from which end or side of the ship
he falls into the water. Those who fall from grace perish no matter how they go about it. Those
who seek to be justified by the Law are fallen from grace and are in grave danger of eternal
death. If this holds true in the case of those who seek to be justified by the moral Law, what
will become of those, I should like to know, who endeavor to be justified by their own regulations
and vows? They will fall to the very bottom of hell. "Oh, no," they say, "we will fly straight
into heaven. If you live according to the rules of Saint Francis, Saint Dominick, Saint Benedict,
you will obtain the peace and mercy of God. If you perform the vows of chastity, obedience,
etc., you will be rewarded with everlasting life."

The words, "Ye are fallen from grace," must not be taken lightly. They are important. To fall
from grace means to lose the atonement, the forgiveness of sins, the righteousness, liberty,
and life which Jesus has merited for us by His death and resurrection. To lose the grace of
God means to gain the wrath and judgment of God, death, the bondage of the devil, and everlasting
condemnation.

  VERSE 6. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
  by faith.

Paul concludes the whole matter with the above statement. "You want to be justified by the
Law, by circumcision, and by works. We cannot see it. To be justified by such means would make
Christ of no value to us. We would be obliged to perform the whole law. We rather through the
Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness." The Apostle is not satisfied to say "justified
by faith." He adds hope to faith.

Holy Writ speaks of hope in two ways: as the object of the emotion, and hope as the emotion
itself. In the first chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians we have an instance of its first
use: "For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven," i.e., the thing hoped for. In the sense
of emotion we quote the passage from the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans: "For
we are saved by hope." As Paul uses the term "hope" here in writing to the Galatians, we may
take it in either of its two meanings. We may understand Paul to say, "We wait in spirit, through
faith, for the righteousness that we hope for, which in due time will be revealed to us." Or
we may understand Paul to say: "We wait in Spirit, by faith for righteousness with great hope
and desire." True, we are righteous, but our righteousness is not yet revealed; as long as
we live here sin stays with us, not to forget the law in our members striving against the law
of our mind. When sin rages in our body and we through the Spirit wrestle against it, then
we have cause for hope. We are not yet perfectly righteous. Perfect righteousness is still
to be attained. Hence we hope for it.

This is sweet comfort for us. And we are to make use of it in comforting the afflicted. We
are to say to them: "Brother, you would like to feel God's favor as you feel your sin. But
you are asking too much. Your righteousness rests on something much better than feelings. Wait
and hope until it will be revealed to you in the Lord's own time. Don't go by your feelings,
but go by the doctrine of faith, which pledges Christ to you."

The question occurs to us, What difference is there between faith and hope? We find it difficult
to see any difference. Faith and hope are so closely linked that they cannot be separated.
Still there is a difference between them.

  First, hope and faith differ in regard to their sources. Faith
  originates in the understanding, while hope rises in the will.

  Secondly, they differ in regard to their functions. Faith says what is
  to be done. Faith teaches, describes, directs. Hope exhorts the mind
  to be strong and courageous.

  Thirdly, they differ in regard to their objectives. Faith concentrates
  on the truth. Hope looks to the goodness of God.

  Fourthly, they differ in sequence. Faith is the beginning of life before
  tribulation. (Hebrews 11.) Hope comes later and is born of tribulation.
  (Romans 5.)

  Fifthly, they differ in regard to their effects. Faith is a judge. It
  judges errors. Hope is a soldier. It fights against tribulations, the
  Cross, despondency, despair, and waits for better things to come in the
  midst of evil.
Without hope faith cannot endure. On the other hand, hope without faith
is blind rashness and arrogance because it lacks knowledge. Before
anything else a Christian must have the insight of faith, so that the
intellect may know its directions in the day of trouble and the heart may
hope for better things. By faith we begin, by hope we continue.

This passage contains excellent doctrine and much comfort. It declares that we are justified
not by works, sacrifices, or ceremonies, but by Christ alone. The world may judge certain things
to be ever so good; without Christ they are all wrong. Circumcision and the law and good works
are carnal. "We," says Paul, "are above such things. We possess Christ by faith and in the
midst of our afflictions we hopefully wait for the consummation of our righteousness."

You may say, "The trouble is I don't feel as if I am righteous." You must not feel, but believe.
Unless you believe that you are righteous, you do Christ a great wrong, for He has cleansed
you by the washing of regeneration, He died for you so that through Him you may obtain righteousness
and everlasting life.

  VERSE 6.

Faith must of course be sincere. It must be a faith that performs good works through love.
If faith lacks love it is not true faith. Thus the Apostle bars the way of hypocrites to the
kingdom of Christ on all sides. He declares on the one hand, "In Christ Jesus circumcision
availeth nothing," i.e., works avail nothing, but faith alone, and that without any merit whatever,
avails before God. On the other hand, the Apostle declares that without fruits faith serves
no purpose. To think, "If faith justifies without works, let us work nothing," is to despise
the grace of God. Idle faith is not justifying faith. In this terse manner Paul presents the
whole life of a Christian. Inwardly it consists in faith towards God, outwardly in love towards
our fellow-men.

  VERSE 7. Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
  the truth?

This is plain speaking. Paul asserts that he teaches the same truth now which he has always
taught, and that the Galatians ran well as long as they obeyed the truth. But now, misled by
the false apostles, they no longer run. He compares the Christian life to a race. When everything
runs along smoothly the Hebrews spoke of it as a race. "Ye did run well," means that everything
went along smoothly and happily with the Galatians. They lived a Christian life and were on
the right way to everlasting life. The words, "Ye did run well," are encouraging indeed. Often
our lives seem to creep rather than to run. But if we abide in the true doctrine and walk in
the spirit, we have nothing to worry about. God judges our lives differently. What may seem
to us a life slow in Christian development may seem to God a life of rapid progression in grace.

  VERSE 7. Who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
The Galatians were hindered in the Christian life when they turned from
faith and grace to the Law. Covertly the Apostle blames the false apostles
for impeding the Christian progress of the Galatians. The false apostles
persuaded the Galatians to believe that they were in error and that they
had made little or no progress under the influence of Paul. Under the
baneful influence of the false apostles the Galatians thought they were
well off and advancing rapidly in Christian knowledge and living.

  VERSE 8. This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

Paul explains how those who had been deceived by false teachers may be restored to spiritual
health. The false apostles were amiable fellows. Apparently they surpassed Paul in learning
and godliness. The Galatians were easily deceived by outward appearances. They supposed they
were being taught by Christ Himself. Paul proved to them that their new doctrine was not of
Christ, but of the devil. In this way he succeeded in regaining many. We also are able to win
back many from the errors into which they were seduced by showing that their beliefs are imaginary,
wicked, and contrary to the Word of God.

The devil is a cunning persuader. He knows how to enlarge the smallest sin into a mountain
until we think we have committed the worst crime ever committed on earth. Such stricken consciences
must be comforted and set straight as Paul corrected the Galatians by showing them that their
opinion is not of Christ because it runs counter to the Gospel, which describes Christ as a
meek and merciful Savior.

Satan will circumvent the Gospel and explain Christ in this his own diabolical way: "Indeed
Christ is meek, gentle, and merciful, but only to those who are holy and righteous. If you
are a sinner you stand no chance. Did not Christ say that unbelievers are already damned? And
did not Christ perform many good deeds, and suffer many evils patiently, bidding us to follow
His example? You do not mean to say that your life is in accord with Christ's precepts or example?
You are a sinner. You are no good at all."

Satan is to be answered in this way: The Scriptures present Christ in a twofold aspect. First,
as a gift. "He of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption."
(I Cor. 1:30.) Hence my many and grievous sins are nullified if I believe in Him. Secondly,
the Scriptures present Christ for our example. As an exemplar He is to be placed before me
only at certain times. In times of joy and gladness that l may have Him as a mirror to reflect
upon my shortcomings. But in the day of trouble I will have Christ only as a gift. I will not
listen to anything else, except that Christ died for my sins.

To those that are cast down on account of their sins Christ must be introduced as a Savior
and Gift, and not as an example. But to sinners who live in a false assurance, Christ must
be introduced as an example. The hard sayings of Scripture and the awful judgments of God upon
sin must be impressed upon them. Defy Satan in times of despair. Say: "O cursed Satan, you
choose a nice time to talk to me about doing and working when you know very well that I am
in trouble over my sins. I will not listen to you. I will listen to Christ, who says that He
came into the world to save sinners. This is the true Christ and there is none other. I can
find plenty of examples for a holy life in Abraham, Isaiah, John the Baptist, Paul, and other
saints. But they cannot forgive my sins. They cannot save me. They cannot procure for me everlasting
life. Therefore I will not have you for my teacher, O Satan."

  VERSE 9. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

Paul's concern for them meant nothing to some of the Galatians. Many had disowned him as their
teacher and gone over to the false apostles. No doubt the false apostles took every occasion
to defame Paul as a stubborn and contemptuous fellow who thought nothing of disrupting the
unity of the churches for no other reason than his selfish pride and jealousy.

Others of the Galatians perhaps saw no harm in deviating a trifle from the doctrine of justification
and faith. When they noticed that Paul made so much ado about a matter that seemed of no particular
importance to them they raised their eyebrows and thought within themselves: "What if we did
deviate a little from the doctrine of Paul? What if we are a little to blame? He ought to overlook
the whole matter, and not make such an issue out of it, lest the unity of the churches be disturbed."
To this Paul replies: "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."

Our opponents record the same complaints about us. They put us down as contentious, ill-tempered
faultfinders. But these are the crafty passes of the devil, with which he seeks to overthrow
our faith. We answer with Paul: "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."

Small faults grow into big faults. To tolerate a trifling error inevitably leads to crass heresy.
The doctrine of the Bible is not ours to take or to allow liberties with. We have no right
to change even a tittle of it. When it comes to life we are ready to do, to suffer, to forgive
anything our opponents demand as long as faith and doctrine remain pure and uncorrupt. The
Apostle James says, "For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he
is guilty of all." This passage supports us over against our critics who claim that we disregard
all charity to the great injury of the churches. We protest we desire nothing more than peace
with all men. If they would only permit us to keep our doctrine of faith! The pure doctrine
takes precedence before charity, apostles, or an angel from heaven.

Let others praise charity and concord to the skies; we magnify the authority of the Word and
faith. Charity may be neglected at times without peril, but not the Word and faith. Charity
suffers all things, it gives in. Faith suffers nothing; it never yields. Charity is often deceived
but is never put out because it lies nothing to lose; it continues to do well even to the ungrateful.
When it comes to faith and salvation in the midst of lies and errors that parade as truth and
deceive many, charity has no voice or vote. Let us not be influenced by the popular cry for
charity and unity. If we do not love God and His Word what difference does it make if we love
anything at all?

Paul, therefore, admonishes both teachers and hearers not to esteem lightly the doctrine of
faith as if it were a toy with which to amuse oneself in idle hours.

  VERSE 10. l have confidence in you through the Lord.

"I have taught, admonished, and reproved you enough. I hope the best for you."

The question occurs to us whether Paul did well to trust the Galatians. Does not Holy Writ
forbid us to trust in men? Faith trusts in God and is never wrong. Charity trusts in men and
is often wrong. This charitable trust in man is necessary to life. Without it life would be
impossible in the world. What kind of life would ours be if nobody could trust anybody else?
True Christians are more ready to believe in men than the children of this world. Such charitable
confidence is the fruit of the Spirit. Paul had such trust in the Galatians although they had
forsaken his doctrine. He trusts them "through the Lord," insofar as they were in Christ and
Christ in them. Once they had forsaken Christ altogether, the Apostle will trust the Galatians
no longer.

  VERSE 10. That ye will be none otherwise minded.

"Not minded otherwise than I have taught you. In other words, I have confidence that you will
accept no doctrine that is contrary to the one you have learned from me."

  VERSE 10. But be that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever
  he be.

Paul assumes the role of a judge and condemns the false apostles as troublers of the Galatians.
He wants to frighten the Galatians with his severe judgments of the false apostles into avoiding
false doctrine like a contagious disease. We can hear him say to the Galatians: "Why do you
give these pestilent fellows a hearing in the first place? They only trouble you. The doctrine
they bring causes your conscience only trouble."

The clause, "whosoever he be," seems to indicate that the false apostles in outward appearance
at least were very good and devout men. It may be that among them was some outstanding disciple
of the apostles, a man of fame and authority. The Apostle must have been faced by this very
situation, otherwise his vehemence would have been uncalled for. No doubt many of the Galatians
were taken back with the vehemency of the Apostle. They perhaps thought: why should he be so
stubborn in such small matters? Why is he so quick to pronounce damnation upon his brethren
in the ministry?

I cannot say it often enough, that we must carefully differentiate between doctrine and life.
Doctrine is a piece of heaven, life is a piece of earth. Life is sin, error, uncleanness, misery,
and charity must forbear, believe, hope, and suffer all things. Forgiveness of sins must be
continuous so that sin and error may not be defended and sustained. But with doctrine there
must be no error, no need of pardon. There can be no comparison between doctrine and life.
The least little point of doctrine is of greater importance than heaven and earth. Therefore
we cannot allow the least jot of doctrine to be corrupted. We may overlook the offenses and
errors of life, for we daily sin much. Even the saints sin, as they themselves confess in the
Lord's Prayer and in the Creed. But our doctrine, God be praised, is pure, because all the
articles of our faith are grounded on the Holy Scriptures.

  VERSE 11. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
  suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.

In his great desire to recall the Galatians, Paul draws himself into the argument. He says:
"Because I refuse to recognize circumcision as a factor in our salvation, I have brought upon
myself the hatred and persecution of my whole nation. If I were to acknowledge circumcision
the Jews would cease to persecute me; in fact they would love and praise me. But because I
preach the Gospel of Christ and the righteousness of faith I must suffer persecution. The false
apostles know how to avoid the Cross and the deadly hatred of the Jewish nation. They preach
circumcision and thus retain the favor of the Jews. If they had their way they would ignore
all differences in doctrine and preserve unity at all cost. But their unionistic dreams cannot
be realized without loss to the pure doctrine of the Cross. It would be too bad if the offense
of the Cross were to cease." To the Corinthians he expressed the same conviction: "Christ sent
me. . .to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made
of none effect." (I Cor. 1:17.)

Here someone may be tempted to call the Christians crazy. Deliberately to court danger by preaching
and confessing the truth, and thus to bring upon ourselves the hatred and enmity of the whole
world, is this not madness? But Paul does not mind the enmity of the world. It made him all
the bolder to confess Christ. The enmity of the world in his estimation augurs well for the
success and growth of the Church, which fares best in times of persecution. When the offense
of the Cross ceases, when the rage of the enemies of the Cross abates, when everything is quiet,
it is a sign that the devil is the door-keeper of the Church and that the pure doctrine of
God's Word has been lost.

Saint Bernard observed that the Church is in best shape when Satan assaults it on every side
by trickery and violence; and in worst shape when it is at peace. In support of his statement
he quotes the passage from the song of Hezekiah: "Behold, for peace I had great bitterness."
Paul looks with suspicion upon any doctrine that does not provoke antagonism.

Persecution always follows on the heels of the Word of God as the Psalmist experienced. "I
believe, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted." (Ps. 116:10.) The Christians are
accused and slandered without mercy. Murderers and thieves receive better treatment than Christians.
The world regards true Christians as the worst offenders, for whom no punishment can be too
severe. The world hates the Christians with amazing brutality, and without compunction commits
them to the most shameful death, congratulating itself that it has rendered God and the cause
of peace a distinct service by ridding the world of the undesired presence of these Christians.
We are not to let such treatment cause us to falter in our adherence to Christ. As long as
we experience such persecutions we know all is well with the Gospel.

Jesus held out the same comfort to His disciples in the fifth chapter of St. Matthew. The Church
must not come short of this joy. I would not want to be at peace with the pope, the bishops,
the princes, and the sectarians, unless they consent to our doctrine. Unity with them would
be an unmistakable sign that we have lost the true doctrine. Briefly, as long as the Church
proclaims the doctrine she must suffer persecution, because the Gospel declares the mercy and
glory of God. This in turn stirs up the devil, because the Gospel shows him up for what he
is, the devil, and not God. Therefore as long as the Gospel holds sway persecution plays the
accompaniment, or else there is something the matter with the devil. When he is hit you will
know it by the havoc he raises everywhere.

So do not be surprised or offended when hell breaks loose. Look upon it as a happy indication
that all is well with the Gospel of the Cross. God forbid that the offense of the Cross should
ever be removed. This would be the case if we were to preach what the prince of this world
and his followers would be only too glad to hear, the righteousness of works. You would never
know the devil could be so gentle, the world so sweet, the Pope so gracious, and the princes
so charming. But because we seek the advantage and honor of Christ, they persecute us all around.

  VERSE 12. I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

It hardly seems befitting an apostle, not only to denounce the false apostles as troublers
of the Church, and to consign them to the devil, but also to wish that they were utterly cut
off--what else would you call it but plain cursing? Paul, I suppose, is alluding to the rite
of circumcision. As if he were saying to the Galatians: "The false apostles compel you to cut
off the foreskin of your flesh. Well, I wish they themselves were utterly cut off by the roots."

We had better answer at once the question, whether it is right for Christians to curse. Certainly
not always, nor for every little cause. But when things have come to such a pass that God and
His Word are openly blasphemed, then we must say: "Blessed be God and His Word, and cursed
be everything that is contrary to God and His Word, even though it should be an apostle, or
an angel from heaven."

This goes to show again how much importance Paul attached to the least points of Christian
doctrine, that he dared to curse the false apostles, evidently men of great popularity and
influence. What right, then, have we to make little of doctrine? No matter how nonessential
a point of doctrine may seem, if slighted it may prove the gradual disintegration of the truths
of our salvation.

Let us do everything to advance the glory and authority of God's Word. Every tittle of it is
greater than heaven and earth. Christian charity and unity have nothing to do with the Word
of God. We are bold to curse and condemn all men who in the least point corrupt the Word of
God, "for a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."

Paul does right to curse these troublers of the Galatians, wishing that they were cut off and
rooted out of the Church of God and that their doctrine might perish forever. Such cursing
is the gift of the Holy Ghost. Thus Peter cursed Simon the sorcerer, "Thy money perish with
thee." Many instances of this holy cursing are recorded in the sacred Scriptures, especially
in the Psalms, e.g., "Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell." (Ps.
55:15.)

                         THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS

Now come all kinds of admonitions and precepts. It was the custom of the apostles that after
they had taught faith and instructed the conscience they followed it up with admonitions unto
good works, that the believers might manifest the duties of love toward each other. In order
to avoid the appearance as if Christianity militated against good works or opposed civil government,
the Apostle also urges us to give ourselves unto good works, to lead an honest life, and to
keep faith and love with one another. This will give the lie to the accusations of the world
that we Christians are the enemies of decency and of public peace. The fact is we Christians
know better what constitutes a truly good work than all the philosophers and legislators of
the world because we link believing with doing.

  VERSE 13. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

In other words: "You have gained liberty through Christ, i.e., You are above all laws as far
as conscience is concerned. You are saved. Christ is your liberty and life. Therefore law,
sin, and death may not hurt you or drive you to despair. This is the constitution of your priceless
liberty. Now take care that you do not use your wonderful liberty for an occasion of the flesh."

Satan likes to turn this liberty which Christ has gotten for us into licentiousness. Already
the Apostle Jude complained in his day: "There are certain men crept in unawares. . .turning
the grace of our God into lasciviousness." (Jude 4.) The flesh reasons: "If we are without
the law, we may as well indulge ourselves. Why do good, why give alms, why suffer evil when
there is no law to force us to do so?"

This attitude is common enough. People talk about Christian liberty and then go and cater to
the desires of covetousness, pleasure, pride, envy, and other vices. Nobody wants to fulfill
his duties. Nobody wants to help out a brother in distress. This sort of thing makes me so
impatient at times that I wish the swine who trampled precious pearls under foot were back
once again under the tyranny of the Pope. You cannot wake up the people of Gomorrah with the
gospel of peace.

Even we creatures of the world do not perform our duties as zealously in the light of the Gospel
as we did before in the darkness of ignorance, because the surer we are of the liberty purchased
for us by Christ, the more we neglect the Word, prayer, well-doing, and suffering. If Satan
were not continually molesting us with trials, with the persecution of our enemies, and the
ingratitude of our brethren, we would become so careless and indifferent to all good works
that in time we would lose our faith in Christ, resign the ministry of the Word, and look for
an easier life. Many of our ministers are beginning to do that very thing. They complain about
the ministry, they maintain they cannot live on their salaries, they whimper about the miserable
treatment they receive at the hand of those whom they delivered from the servitude of the law
by the preaching of the Gospel. These ministers desert our poor and maligned Christ, involve
themselves in the affairs of the world, seek advantages for themselves and not for Christ.
With what results they shall presently find out.

Since the devil lies in ambush for those in particular who hate the world, and seeks to deprive
us of our liberty of the spirit or to brutalize it into the liberty of the flesh, we plead
with our brethren after the manner of Paul, that they may never use this liberty of the spirit
purchased for us by Christ as an excuse for carnal living, or as Peter expresses it, I Peter
2:16, "for a cloak of maliciousness."

In order that Christians may not abuse their liberty the Apostle encumbers them with the rule
of mutual love that they should serve each other in love. Let everybody perform the duties
of his station and vocation diligently and help his neighbor to the limit of his capacity.

Christians are glad to hear and obey this teaching of love. When others hear about this Christian
liberty of ours they at once infer, "If I am free, I may do what I like. If salvation is not
a matter of doing why should we do anything for the poor?" In this crude manner they turn the
liberty of the spirit into wantonness and licentiousness. We want them to know, however, that
if they use their lives and possessions after their own pleasure, if they do not help the poor,
if they cheat their fellow-men in business and snatch and scrape by hook and by crook everything
they can lay their hands on, we want to tell them that they are not free, no matter how much
they think they are, but they are the dirty slaves of the devil, and are seven times worse
than they ever were as the slaves of the Pope.

As for us, we are obliged to preach the Gospel which offers to all men liberty from the Law,
sin, death, and God's wrath. We have no right to conceal or revoke this liberty proclaimed
by the Gospel. And so we cannot do anything with the swine who dive headlong into the filth
of licentiousness. We do what we can, we diligently admonish them to love and to help their
fellow-men. If our admonitions bear no fruit, we leave them to God, who will in His own good
time take care of these disrespecters of His goodness. In the meanwhile we comfort ourselves
with the thought that our labors are not lost upon the true believers. They appreciate this
spiritual liberty and stand ready to serve others in love and, though their number is small,
the satisfaction they give us far outweighs the discouragement which we receive at the hands
of the large number of those who misuse this liberty.

Paul knows how to explain the law of God. He condenses all the laws of  Moses into one brief
sentence. Reason takes offense at the brevity with  which Paul treats the Law. Therefore reason
looks down upon the  doctrine of faith and its truly good works. To serve one another in love,
i.e., to instruct the erring, to comfort the afflicted, to raise the fallen, to  help one's
neighbor in every possible way, to bear with his infirmities, to  endure hardships, toil, ingratitude
in the Church and in the world, and on  the other hand to obey government, to honor one's parents,
to be patient  at home with a nagging wife and an unruly family, these things are not at  all
regarded as good works. The fact is, they are such excellent works that  the world cannot possibly
estimate them at their true value.

It is tersely spoken: "Love thy neighbour as thyself." But what more needs to be said? You
cannot find a better or nearer example than your own. If you want to know how you ought to
love your neighbor, ask yourself how much you love yourself. If you were to get into trouble
or danger, you would be glad to have the love and help of all men. You do not need any book
of instructions to teach you how to love your neighbor. All you have to do is to look into
your own heart, and it will tell you how you ought to love your neighbor as yourself.

My neighbor is every person, especially those who need my help, as Christ explained in the
tenth chapter of Luke. Even if a person has done me some wrong, or has hurt me in any way,
he is still a human being with flesh and blood. As long as a person remains a human being,
so long is he to be an object of our love.

Paul therefore urges his Galatians and, incidentally, all believers to serve each other in
love. "You Galatians do not have to accept circumcision. If you are so anxious to do good works,
I will tell you in one word how you can fulfill all laws. 'By love serve one another.' You
will never lack people to whom you may do good. The world is full of people who need your help."

  VERSE 15. But if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be
  not consumed one of another.

When faith in Christ is overthrown peace and unity come to an end in the church. Diverse opinions
and dissensions about doctrine and life spring up, and one member bites and devours the other,
i.e., they condemn each other until they are consumed. To this the Scriptures and the experience
of all times bear witness. The many sects at present have come into being because one sect
condemns the other. When the unity of the spirit has been lost there can be no agreement in
doctrine or life. New errors must appear without measure and without end.

For the avoidance of discord Paul lays down the principle: "Let every person do his duty in
the station of life into which God has called him. No person is to vaunt himself above others
or find fault with the efforts of others while lauding his own. Let everybody serve in love."

It is not an easy matter to teach faith without works, and still to require works. Unless the
ministers of Christ are wise in handling the mysteries of God and rightly divide the word,
faith and good works may easily be confused. Both the doctrine of faith and the doctrine of
good works must be diligently taught, and yet in such a way that both the doctrines stay within
their God-given sphere. If we only teach works, as our opponents do, we shall lose the faith.
If we only teach faith people will come to think that good works are superfluous.

  VERSE 16. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not
  fulfill the lust of the flesh.

exhort you to mutual love you are not to think that I have gone back on my teaching of justification
by faith alone. I am still of the same opinion. To remove every possibility for misunderstanding
I have added this explanatory note: 'Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust
of the flesh.'"

With this verse Paul explains how he wants this sentence to be understood: By love serve one
another. When I bid you to love one another, this is what I mean and require, 'Walk in the
Spirit.' I know very well you will not fulfill the Law, because you are sinners as long as
you live. Nevertheless, you should endeavor to walk in the spirit, i.e., fight against the
flesh and follow the leads of the Holy Ghost."

It is quite apparent that Paul had not forgotten the doctrine of justification,  for in bidding
the Galatians to walk in the Spirit he at the same time  denies that good works can justify.
"When I speak of the fulfilling of the  Law I do not mean to say that you are justified by
the Law. All I mean to  say is that you should take the Spirit for your guide and resist the
flesh.  That is the most you shall ever be able to do. Obey the Spirit and fight  against the
flesh."

   VERSE 16. And ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

The lust of the flesh is not altogether extinct in us. It rises up again and again and wrestles
with the Spirit. No flesh, not even that of the true believer, is so completely under the influence
of the Spirit that it will not bite or devour, or at least neglect, the commandment of love.
At the slightest provocation it flares up, demands to be revenged, and hates a neighbor like
an enemy, or at least does not love him as much as he ought to be loved.

Therefore the Apostle establishes this rule of love for the believers. Serve one another in
love. Bear the infirmities of your brother. Forgive one another. Without such bearing and forbearing,
giving and forgiving, there can be no unity because to give and to take offense are unavoidably
human.

Whenever you are angry with your brother for any cause, repress your violent emotions through
the Spirit. Bear with his weakness and love him. He does not cease to be your neighbor or brother
because he offended you. On the contrary, he now more than ever before requires your loving
attention.

The scholastics take the lust of the flesh to mean carnal lust. True, believers too are tempted
with carnal lust. Even the married are not immune to carnal lusts. Men set little value upon
that which they have and covet what they have not, as the poet says:

  "The things most forbidden we always desire, And things most denied
   we seek to acquire."

I do not deny that the lust of the flesh includes carnal lust. But it takes in more. It takes
in all the corrupt desires with which the believers are more or less infected, as pride, hatred,
covetousness, impatience. Later on Paul enumerates among the works of the flesh even idolatry
and heresy. The apostle's meaning is clear. "I want you to love one another. But you do not
do it. In fact you cannot do it, because of your flesh. Hence we cannot be justified by deeds
of love. Do not for a moment think that I am reversing myself on my stand concerning faith.
Faith and hope must continue. By faith we are justified, by hope we endure to the end. In addition
we serve each other in love because true faith is not idle. Our love, however, is faulty. In
bidding you to walk in the Spirit I indicate to you that our love is not sufficient to justify
us. Neither do I demand that you should get rid of the flesh, but that you should control and
subdue it."

  VERSE 17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit
  against the flesh.

When Paul declares that "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh,"
he means to say that we are not to think, speak or do the things to which the flesh incites
us. "I know," he says, "that the flesh courts sin. The thing for you to do is to resist the
flesh by the Spirit. But if you abandon the leadership of the Spirit for that of the flesh,
you are going to fulfill the lust of the flesh and die in your sins."

  VERSE 17. And these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye
  cannot do the things that ye would.

These two leaders, the flesh and the Spirit, are bitter opponents.

The scholastics are at a loss to understand this confession of Paul and feel obliged to save
his honor. That the chosen vessel of Christ should have had the law of sin in his members seems
to them incredible and absurd. Because the fourteenth point was thus be say in eld is not be sure:

 I told myself: "You have permitted this and
that sin, envy, impatience, and the like. Your joining this holy order has been in vain, and
all your good works are good for nothing." If at that time I had understood this passage, "The
flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh," I could have spared myself
many a day of self- torment. I would have said to myself: "Martin, you will never be without
sin, for you have flesh. Despair not, but resist the flesh."

I remember how Doctor Staupitz used to say to me: "I have promised God a thousand times that
I would become a better man, but I never kept my promise. From now on I am not going to make
any more vows. Experience has taught me that I cannot keep them. Unless God is merciful to
me for Christ's sake and grants unto me a blessed departure, I shall not be able to stand before
Him." His was a God-pleasing despair. (Ps. 130:3.)

No man is to despair of salvation just because he is aware of the lust of the flesh. Let him
be aware of it so long as he does not yield to it. The passion of lust, wrath, and other vices
may shake him, but they are not to get him down. Sin may assail him, but he is not to welcome
it. Yes, the better Christian a man is, the more he will experience the heat of the conflict.
This explains the many expressions of regret in the Psalms and in the entire Bible. Everybody
is to determine his peculiar weakness and guard against it. Watch and wrestle in spirit against
your weakness. Even if you cannot completely overcome it, at least you ought to fight against it.

According to this description a saint is not one who is made of wood and never feels any lusts
or desires of the flesh. A true saint confesses his righteousness and prays that his sins may
be forgiven. The whole Church prays for the forgiveness of sins and confesses that it believes
in the forgiveness of sins. If our antagonists would read the Scriptures they would soon discover
that they cannot judge rightly of anything, either of sin or of holiness.

  VERSE 18. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

Here someone may object: "How come we are not under the law? You yourself say, Paul, that we
have the flesh which wars against the Spirit, and brings us into subjection."

But Paul says not to let it trouble us. As long as we are led by the Spirit, and are willing
to obey the Spirit who resists the flesh, we are not under the Law. True believers are not
under the Law. The Law cannot condemn them although they feel sin and confess it.

Great then is the power of the Spirit. Led by the Spirit, the Law cannot condemn the believer
though he commits real sin. For Christ in whom we believe is our righteousness. He is without
sin, and the Law cannot accuse Him. As long as we cling to Him we are led by the Spirit and
are free from the Law. Even as he teaches good works, the Apostle does not lose sight of the
doctrine of justification, but shows at every turn that it is impossible for us to be justified
by works.

The words, "If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law," are replete with comfort.
It happens at times that anger, hatred, impatience, carnal desire, fear, sorrow, or some other
lust of the flesh so overwhelms a man that he cannot shake them off, though he try ever so
hard. What should he do? Should he despair? God forbid. Let him say to himself: "My flesh seems
to be on a warpath against the Spirit again. Go to it, flesh, and rage all you want to. But
you are not going to have your way. I follow the leading of the Spirit."

When the flesh begins to cut up the only remedy is to take the sword of the Spirit, the word
of salvation, and fight against the flesh. If you set the Word out of sight, you are helpless
against the flesh. I know this to be a fact. I have been assailed by many violent passions,
but as soon as I took hold of some Scripture passage, my temptations left me. Without the Word
I could not have helped myself against the flesh.

  VERSE 19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these.

Paul is saying: "That none of you may hide behind the plea of ignorance I will enumerate first
the works of the flesh, and then also the works of the Spirit."

There were many hypocrites among the Galatians, as there are also among us, who pretend to
be Christians and talk much about the Spirit, but they walk not according to the Spirit; rather
according to the flesh. Paul is out to show them that they are not as holy as they like to
have others think they are.

Every period of life has its own peculiar temptations. Not one true believer whom the flesh
does not again and again incite to impatience, anger, pride. But it is one thing to be tempted
by the flesh, and another thing to yield to the flesh, to do its bidding without fear or remorse,
and to continue in sin.

Christians also fall and perform the lusts of the flesh. David fell horribly into adultery.
Peter also fell grievously when he denied Christ. However great these sins were, they were
not committed to spite God, but from weakness. When their sins were brought to their attention
these men did not obstinately continue in their sin, but repented. Those who sin through weakness
are not denied pardon as long as they rise again and cease to sin. There is nothing worse than
to continue in sin. If they do not repent, but obstinately continue to fulfill the desires
of the flesh, it is a sure sign that they are not sincere.

No person is free from temptations. Some are tempted in one way, others in another way. One
person is more easily tempted to bitterness and sorrow of spirit, blasphemy, distrust, and
despair. Another is more easily tempted to carnal lust, anger, envy, covetousness. But no matter
to which sins we are disposed, we are to walk in the Spirit and resist the flesh. Those who
are Christ's own crucify their flesh.

Some of the old saints labored so hard to attain perfection that they lost the capacity to
feel anything. When I was a monk I often wished I could see a saint. I pictured him as living
in the wilderness, abstaining from meat and drink and living on roots and herbs and cold water.
This weird conception of those awesome saints I had gained out of the books of the scholastics
and church fathers. But we know now from the Scriptures who the true saints are. Not those
who live a single life, or make a fetish of days, meats, clothes, and such things. The true
saints are those who believe that they are justified by the death of Christ. Whenever Paul
writes to the Christians here and there he calls them the holy children and heirs of God. All
who believe in Christ, whether male or female, bond or free, are saints; not in view of their
own works, but in view of the merits of God which they appropriate by faith. Their holiness
is a gift and not their own personal achievement.

Ministers of the Gospel, public officials, parents, children, masters, servants, etc., are
true saints when they take Christ for their wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,
and when they fulfill the duties of their several vocations according to the standard of God's
Word and repress the lust and desires of the flesh by the Spirit. Not everybody can resist
temptations with equal facilities. Imperfections are bound to show up. But this does not prevent
them from being holy. Their unintentional lapses are forgiven if they pull themselves together
by faith in Christ. God forbid that we should sit in hasty judgment on those who are weak in
faith and life, as long as they love the Word of God and make use of the supper of the Lord.

I thank God that He has permitted me to see (what as a monk I so  earnestly desired to see)
not one but many saints, whole multitudes of true  saints. Not the kind of saints the papists
admire, but the kind of saints  Christ wants. I am sure I am one of Christ's true saints. I
am baptized. I  believe that Christ my Lord has redeemed me from all my sins, and  invested
me with His own eternal righteousness and holiness. To hide in  caves and dens, to have a bony
body, to wear the hair long in the mistaken  idea that such departures from normalcy will obtain
some special regard  in heaven is not the holy life. A holy life is to be baptized and to believe
in  Christ, and to subdue the flesh with the Spirit.

To feel the lusts of the flesh is not without profit to us. It prevents us from  being vain
and from being puffed up with the wicked opinion of our own work-righteousness. The monks were
so inflated with the opinion of their  own righteousness, they thought they had so much holiness
that they  could afford to sell some of it to others, although their own hearts  convinced
them of unholiness. The Christian feels the unholy condition  of his heart, and it makes him
feel so low that he cannot trust in his good  works. He therefore goes to Christ to find perfect
righteousness. This keeps  a Christian humble.

  VERSES 19, 20. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
  these: adultery, fornification, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
  witchcraft . . .

Paul does not enumerate all the works of the flesh, but only certain ones. First, he mentions
various kinds of carnal lusts, as adultery, fornication, wantonness, etc. But carnal lust is
not the only work of the flesh, and so he counts among the works of the flesh also idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, and the like. These terms are so familiar that they do not require lengthy
explanations.

                                  IDOLATRY

The best religion, the most fervent devotion without Christ is plain idolatry. It has been
considered a holy act when the monks in their cells meditate upon God and His works, and in
a religious frenzy kneel down to pray and to weep for joy. Yet Paul calls it simply idolatry.
Every religion which worships God in ignorance or neglect of His Word and will is idolatry.

They may think about God, Christ, and heavenly things, but they do it after their own fashion
and not after the Word of God. They have an idea that their clothing, their mode of living,
and their conduct are holy and pleasing to Christ. They not only expect to pacify Christ by
the strictness of their life, but also expect to be rewarded by Him for their good deeds. Hence
their best "spiritual" thoughts are wicked thoughts. Any worship of God, any religion without
Christ is idolatry. In Christ alone is God well pleased.

I have said before that the works of the flesh are manifest. But idolatry puts on such a good
front and acts so spiritual that the sham of it is recognized only by true believers.

                                 WITCHCRAFT

This sin was very common before the light of the Gospel appeared. When I was a child there
were many witches and sorcerers around who "bewitched" cattle, and people, particularly children,
and did much harm. But now that the Gospel is here you do not hear so much about it because
the Gospel drives the devil away. Now he bewitches people in a worse way with spiritual sorcery.

Witchcraft is a brand of idolatry. As witches used to bewitch cattle and men, so idolaters,
i.e., all the self-righteous, go around to bewitch God and to make Him out as one who justifies
men not by grace through faith in Christ but by the works of men's own choosing. They bewitch
and deceive themselves. If they continue in their wicked thoughts of God they will die in their
idolatry.

                                    SECTS

Under sects Paul here understands heresies. Heresies have always been found in the church.
What unity of faith can exist among all the different monks and the different orders? None
whatever. There is no unity of spirit, no agreement of minds, but great dissension in the papacy.
There is no conformity in doctrine, faith, and life. On the other hand, among evangelical Christians
the Word, faith, religion, sacraments, service, Christ, God, heart, and mind are common to
all. This unity is not disturbed by outward differences of station or of occupation.

                            DRUNKENNESS, GLUTTONY

Paul does not say that eating and drinking are works of the flesh, but intemperance in eating
and drinking, which is a common vice nowadays, is a work of the flesh. Those who are given
to excess are to know that they are not spiritual but carnal. Sentence is pronounced upon them
that they shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven. Paul desires that Christians avoid drunkenness
and gluttony, that they live temperate and sober lives, in order that the body may not grow
soft and sensual.

  VERSE 21. Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in
  the past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
  of God.

 Where this virtue is lacking men are suspicious, forward, and

necessary. What kind of life would this be if one person could not believe another person?

                                  MEEKNESS

A person is meek when he is not quick to get angry. Many things occur in daily life to provoke
a person's anger, but the Christian gets over his anger by meekness.

                                 TEMPERANCE

Christians are to lead sober and chaste lives. They should not be adulterers, fornicators,
or sensualists. They should not be quarrelers or drunkards. In the first and second chapters
of the Epistle to Titus, the Apostle admonishes bishops, young women, and married folks to
be  chaste and pure.

  VERSE 23. Against such there is no law.

There is a law, of course, but it does not apply to those who bear these fruits of the Spirit.
The Law is not given for the righteous man. A true Christian conducts himself in such a way
that he does not need any law to warn or to restrain him. He obeys the Law without compulsion.
The Law does not concern him. As far as he is concerned there would not have to be any Law.

  VERSE 24. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
  affections and lusts.

True believers are no hypocrites. They crucify the flesh with its evil desires and lusts. Inasmuch
as they have not altogether put off the sinful flesh they are inclined to sin. They do not
fear or love God as they should. They are likely to be provoked to anger, to envy, to impatience,
to carnal lust, and other emotions. But they will not do the things to which the flesh incites
them. They crucify the flesh with its evil desires and lusts by fasting and exercise and, above
all, by a walk in the Spirit.

To resist the flesh in this manner is to nail it to the Cross. Although the flesh is still
alive it cannot very well act upon its desires because it is bound and nailed to the Cross.

  VERSE 25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
A little while ago the Apostle had condemned those who are envious and
start heresies and schisms. As if he had forgotten that he had already
berated them, the Apostle once more reproves those who provoke and
envy others. Was not one reference to them sufficient? He repeats his
admonition in order to emphasize the viciousness of pride that had
caused all the trouble in the churches of Galatia, and has always caused the
Church of Christ no end of difficulties. In his Epistle to Titus the Apostle
states that a vainglorious man should not be ordained as a minister, for
pride, as St. Augustine points out, is the mother of all heresies.

Now vainglory has always been a common poison in the world. There is no village too small to
contain someone who wants to be considered wiser or better than the rest. Those who have been
bitten by pride usually stand upon the reputation for learning and wisdom. Vainglory is not
nearly so bad in a private person or even in an official as it is in a minister.

When the poison of vainglory gets into the Church you have no idea what havoc it can cause.
You may argue about knowledge, art, money, countries, and the like without doing particular
harm. But you cannot quarrel about salvation or damnation, about eternal life and eternal death
without grave damage to the Church. No wonder Paul exhorts all ministers of the Word to guard
against this poison. He writes: "If we live in the Spirit." Where the Spirit is, men gain new
attitudes. Where formerly they were vainglorious, spiteful and envious, they now become humble,
gentle and patient. Such men seek not their own glory, but the glory of God. They do not provoke
each other to wrath or envy, but prefer others to themselves.

As dangerous to the Church as this abominable pride is, yet there is nothing more common. The
trouble with the ministers of Satan is that they look upon the ministry as a stepping-stone
to fame and glory, and right there you have the seed for all sorts of dissensions.

Because Paul knew that the vainglory of the false Apostles had caused the churches of Galatia
endless trouble, he makes it his business to suppress this abominable vice. In his absence
the false apostles went to work in Galatia. They pretended that they had been on intimate terms
with the apostles, while Paul had never seen Christ in person or had much contact with the
rest of the apostles. Because of this they delivered him, rejected his doctrine, and boosted
their own. In this way they troubled the Galatians and caused quarrels among them until they
provoked and envied each other; which goes to show that neither the false apostles nor the
Galatians walked after the Spirit, but after the flesh.

The Gospel is not there for us to aggrandize ourselves. The Gospel is to aggrandize Christ
and the mercy of God. It holds out to men eternal gifts that are not gifts of our own manufacture.
What right have we to receive praise and glory for gifts that are not of our own making?

No wonder that God in His special grace subjects the ministers of the Gospel to all kinds of
afflictions, otherwise they could not cope with this ugly beast called vainglory. If no persecution,
no cross, or reproach trailed the doctrine of the Gospel, but only praise and reputation, the
ministers of the Gospel would choke with pride. Paul had the Spirit of Christ. Nevertheless
there was given unto him the messenger of Satan to buffet him in order that he should not come
to exalt himself, because of the grandeur of his revelations. St. Augustine's opinion is well
taken: "If a minister of the Gospel is praised, he is in danger; if he is despised, he is also
in danger."

The ministers of the Gospel should be men who are not too easily affected by praise or criticism,
but simply speak out the benefit and the glory of Christ and seek the salvation of souls.

Whenever you are being praised, remember it is not you who is being praised but Christ, to
whom all praise belongs. When you preach the Word of God in its purity and also live accordingly,
it is not your own doing, but God's doing. And when people praise you, they really mean to
praise God in you. When you understand this--and you should because "what hast thou that thou
didst not receive?"--you will not flatter yourself on the one hand and on the other hand you
will not carry yourself with the thought of resigning from the ministry when you are insulted,
reproached, or persecuted.

It is really kind of God to send so much infamy, reproach, hatred, and cursing our way to keep
us from getting proud of the gifts of God in us. We need a millstone around our neck to keep
us humble. There are a few on our side who love and revere us for the ministry of the Word,
but for every one of these there are a hundred on the other side who hate and persecute us.

The Lord is our glory. Such gifts as we possess we acknowledge to be the gifts of God, given
to us for the good of the Church of Christ. Therefore we are not proud because of them. We
know that more is required of them to whom much is given, than of such to whom little is given.
We also know that God is no respecter of persons. A plain factory hand who does his work faithfully
pleases God just as much as a minister of the Word.

  VERSE 26. Let us not be desirous of vain glory.

To desire vainglory is to desire lies, because when one person praises another he tells lies.
What is there in anybody to praise? But it is different when the ministry is praised. We should
not only desire people to praise the ministry of the Gospel but also do our utmost to make
the ministry worthy of praise because this will make the ministry more effective. Paul warns
the Romans not to bring Christianity into disrepute. "Let not then your good be evil spoken
of." (Rom. 14:16.) He also begged the Corinthians to "give no offense in anything, that the
ministry be not blamed." (I Cor. 6:3.) When people praise our ministry they are not praising
our persons, but God.

  VERSE 26. Provoking one another, envying one another.

Such is the ill effect of vainglory. Those who teach errors provoke others. When others disapprove
and reject the doctrine the teachers of errors get angry in turn, and then you have strife
and trouble. The sectarians hate us furiously because we will not approve their errors. We
did not attack them directly. We merely called attention to certain abuses in the Church. They
did not like it and became sore at us, because it hurt their pride. They wish to be the lone
rulers of the church.

IF we carefully weigh the words of the Apostle we perceive that he does not speak of doctrinal
faults and errors, but of much lesser faults by which a person is overtaken through the weakness
of his flesh. This explains why the Apostle chooses the softer term "fault." To minimize the
offense still more, as if he meant to excuse it altogether and to take the whole blame away
from the person who has committed the fault, he speaks of him as having been "overtaken," seduced
by the devil and of the flesh. As if he meant to say, "What is more human than for a human
being to fall, to be deceived and to err?" This comforting sentence at one time saved my life.
Because Satan always assails both the purity of doctrine which he endeavors to take away by
schisms and the purity of life which he spoils with his continual temptations to sin, Paul
explains how the fallen should be treated. Those who are strong are to raise up the fallen
in the spirit of meekness.

This ought to be borne in mind particularly by the ministers of the Word in order that they
may not forget the parental attitude which Paul here requires of those who have the keeping
of souls. Pastors and ministers must, of course, rebuke the fallen, but when they see that
the fallen are sorry they are to comfort them by excusing the fault as well as they can. As
unyielding as the Holy Spirit is in the matter of maintaining and defending the doctrine of
faith, so mild and merciful is He toward men for their sins as long as sinners repent.

The Pope's synagogue teaches the exact opposite of what the Apostle  commands. The clerics
are tyrants and butchers of men's conscience. Every  small offense is closely scrutinized.
To justify the cruel inquisitiveness they  quote the statement of Pope Gregory: "It is the
property of good lives to be  afraid of a fault where there is no fault." "Our censors must
be feared, even  if they are unjust and wrong." On these pronouncements the papists base  their
doctrine of excommunication. Rather than terrify and condemn  men's consciences, they ought
to raise them up and comfort them with the  truth.

Let the ministers of the Gospel learn from Paul how to deal with those who have sinned. "Brethren,"
he says, "if any man be overtaken with a fault, do not aggravate his grief, do not scold him,
do not condemn him, but lift him up and gently restore his faith. If you see a brother despondent
over a sin he has committed, run up to him, reach out your hand to him, comfort him with the
Gospel and embrace him like a mother. When you meet a willful sinner who does not care, go
after him and rebuke him sharply." But this is not the treatment for one who has been overtaken
by a sin and is sorry. He must be dealt with in the spirit of meekness and not in the spirit
of severity. A repentant sinner is not to be given gall and vinegar to drink.

  VERSE 1. Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
This consideration is very much needed to put a stop to the severity of
some pastors who show the fallen no mercy. St. Augustine says: "There is
no sin which one person has committed, that another person may not
commit it also." We stand in slippery places. If we become overbearing and
neglect our duty, it is easy enough to fall into sin. In the book entitled
"The Lives of Our Fathers," one of the Fathers is reported to have said
when informed that a brother had fallen into adultery: "He fell yesterday; I
may fall today." Paul therefore warns the pastors not to be too rigorous and
unmerciful towards offenders, but to show them every affection, always
remembering: "This man fell into sin; I may fall into worse sin. If those
who are always so eager to condemn others would investigate themselves
they would find that the sins of others are motes in comparison to their
own."

"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." (I Cor. 10:12.) If David
who was a hero of faith and did so many great things for the Lord, could fall so badly that
in spite of his advanced age he was overcome by youthful lust after he had withstood so many
different temptations with which the Lord had tested his faith, who are we to think that we
are more stable? Cannot be more passive.

 Who cares whether the world praises or hates us? We go ahead "by honour and dishonour,
by evil report and good report." (II Cor. 6:8.)

The Gospel entails persecution. The Gospel is that kind of a doctrine. Furthermore, the disciples
of the Gospel are not all dependable. Many embrace the Gospel today and tomorrow discard it.
To preach the Gospel for praise is bad business especially when people stop praising you. Find
your praise in the testimony of a good conscience.

This passage may also be applied to other work besides the ministry. When an official, a servant,
a teacher minds his business and performs his duty faithfully without concerning himself about
matters that are not in his line he may rejoice in himself. The best commendation of any work
is to know that one has done the work that God has given him well and that God is pleased with
his effort.

  VERSE 5. Every man shall bear his own burden.

That means: For anybody to covet praise is foolish because the praise of men will be of no
help to you in the hour of death. Before the judgment throne of Christ everybody will have
to bear his own burden. As it is the praise of men stops when we die. Before the eternal Judge
it is not praise that counts but your own conscience.

True, the consciousness of work well done cannot quiet the conscience. But it is well to have
the testimony of a good conscience in the last judgment that we have performed our duty faithfully
in accordance with God's will.

For the suppression of pride we need the strength of prayer. What man even if he is a Christian
is not delighted with his own praise? Only the Holy Spirit can preserve us from the misfortune
of pride.

  VERSE 6. Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
  teacheth in all good things.

Now the Apostle also addresses the hearers of the Word requesting them to bestow "all good
things" upon those who have taught them the Gospel. I have often wondered why all the apostles
reiterated this request with such embarrassing frequency. In the papacy I saw the people give
generously for the erection and maintenance of luxurious church buildings and for the sustenance
of men appointed to the idolatrous service of Rome. I saw bishops and priests grow rich until
they possessed the choicest real estate. I thought then that Paul's admonitions were overdone.
I thought he should have requested the people to curtail their contributions. I saw how the
generosity of the people of the Church was encouraging covetousness on the part of the clergy.
I know better now.

As often as I read the admonitions of the Apostle to the effect that the churches should support
their pastors and raise funds for the relief of impoverished Christians I am half ashamed to
think that the great Apostle Paul had to touch upon this subject so frequently. In writing
to the Corinthians he needed two chapters to impress this matter upon them. I would not want
to discredit Wittenberg as Paul discredited the Corinthians by urging them at such length to
contribute to the relief of the poor. It seems to be a by-product of the Gospel that nobody
wants to contribute to the maintenance of the Gospel ministry. When the doctrine of the devil
is preached people are prodigal in their willing support of those who deceive them.

We have come to understand why it is so necessary to repeat the admonition of this verse. When
Satan cannot suppress the preaching of the Gospel by force he tries to accomplish his purpose
by striking the ministers of the Gospel with poverty. He curtails their income to such an extent
that they are forced out of the ministry because they cannot live by the Gospel. Without ministers
to proclaim the Word of God the people go wild like savage beasts.

Paul's admonition that the hearers of the Gospel share all good things with their pastors and
teachers is certainly in order. (I Cor. 9:11.) In the old days when the Pope reigned supreme
everybody paid plenty for masses. The begging friars brought in their share. Commercial priests
counted the daily offerings. From these extortions our countrymen are now delivered by the
Gospel. You would think they would be grateful for their emancipation and give generously for
the support of the ministry of the Gospel and the relief of impoverished Christians. Instead,
they rob Christ. When the members of a Christian congregation permit their pastor to struggle
along in penury, they are worse than heathen.

Before very long they are going to suffer for their ingratitude. They
will lose their temporal and spiritual possessions. This sin merits the
severest punishment. The reason why the churches of Galatia, Corinth,
and other places were troubled by false apostles was this, that they had so
 little regard for their faithful ministers. You cannot refuse to give God a
penny who gives you all good things, even life eternal, and turn around
and give the devil, the giver of all evil and death eternal, pieces of gold,
and not be punished for it.

The words "in all good things: are not to be understood to mean that people are to give all
they have to their ministers, but that they should support them liberally and give them enough
to live well.

  VERSE 7. Be not deceived; God is not mocked.

The Apostle is so worked up over this matter that he is not content with a mere admonition.
He utters the threatening words, "God is not mocked." Our countrymen think it good sport to
despise the ministry. They like to treat the ministers like servants and slaves. "Be not deceived,"
warns the Apostle, "God is not mocked." God will not be mocked in His ministers. Christ said:
"He that despiseth you, despiseth me." (Luke 10:16.) To Samuel God said: "They have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me." (I Sam. 8:7.) Be careful, you scoffers. God may postpone
His punishment for a time, but He will find you out in time, and punish you for despising His
servants. But our ancestors do far surpassed the feasts. Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother
to Henry iii. had, and to certain marriage, (as is preached,) 30,000 virtues of meat. Among
the great feasts given of public occasions, may not be preached if given in 1612, and on revelation
Man is not palatine Apostle with Who, daughter of James i received.
the next was in 16, when Charles Creature. returned from his unhappy
and inefficacious mercy by Scotland.

   I am made to appear as if I am speaking for my own benefit. If
a minister preaches on money he is likely to be accused of covetousness. Still people must
be told these things that they may know their duty over against their pastors. Even so hath
the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel."

This simile of sowing and reaping also refers to the proper support of ministers. "He that
soweth to the Spirit," i.e., he that honors the ministers of God is doing a spiritual thing
and will reap everlasting life. "He that soweth to the flesh," i.e., he that has nothing left
for the ministers of God, but only thinks of himself, that person will reap of the flesh corruption,
not only in this life but also in the life to come. The Apostle wants to stir up his readers
to be generous to their pastors.

That the ministers of the Church need support any man with common sense can see. Though this
support is something physical the Apostle does not hesitate to call it sowing to the Spirit.
When people scrape up everything they can lay their hands on and keep everything for themselves
the Apostle calls it a sowing to the flesh. He pronounces those who sow to the Spirit blessed
for this life and the life to come, while those who sow to the flesh are accursed now and forever.

  VERSE 9. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
  shall reap, if we faint not.

The Apostle intends soon to close his Epistle and therefore repeats once more the general exhortation
unto good deeds. (1) such as truly have strong grounds when wrote on support, and does faint life before
we shall be good that they are crooked; and (9) the which to extinguish the destitute, and are

These three counts against the false apostles are of so serious a nature that no Christian
could have fellowship with them. But not all the Galatians obeyed the warning of Paul.

The Apostle's attack upon the false apostles was not unjustified. Neither are our attacks upon
the papacy. When we call the Pope the Antichrist and his minions an evil brood, we do not slander
them. We merely judge them by the touchstone of God's Word recorded in the first chapter of
this Epistle: "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."

  VERSE 13. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the
  law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your
  flesh.

In other words: "I shall tell you what kind of teachers you have now. They avoid the Cross,
they teach no certain truths. They think they are performing the Law, but they are not. They
have not the Holy Spirit and without Him nobody can keep the Law." Where the Holy Ghost does
not dwell in men there dwells an unclean spirit, a spirit that despises God and turns every
effort at keeping the Law into a double sin.

Mark what the Apostle is saying: Those who are circumcised do not fulfill the Law. No self-righteous
person ever does. To work, pray, or suffer apart from Christ is to work, pray, and to suffer
in vain, "for whatsoever is not of faith is sin." It does a person no good to be circumcised,
to fast, to pray, or to do anything, if in his heart he despises Christ.

"Why do the false apostles insist that you should be circumcised? Not for the sake of your
righteousness," although they give that impression, but "that they may glory in your flesh."
Now what sort of an ambition is that? Worst of all, they force circumcision upon you for no
other reason than the satisfaction they get out of your submission.

  VERSE 14.

"God forbid," says the Apostle, "that I should glory in anything as dangerous as the false
apostles glory in because what they glory in is a poison that destroys many souls, and I wish
it were buried in hell. Let them glory in the flesh if they wish and let them perish in their
glory. As for me I glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." He expresses the same sentiment
in the fifth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, where he says: "We glory in tribulations";
and in the twelfth chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians: "Most gladly, therefore,
will l rather glory in my infirmities." According to these expressions the glory of a Christian
consists in tribulations, reproaches, and infirmities.

And this is our glory today with the Pope and the whole world persecuting us and trying to
kill us. We know that we suffer these things not because we are thieves and murderers, but
for Christ's sake whose Gospel we proclaim. We have no reason to complain. The world, of course,
looks upon us as unhappy and accursed creatures, but Christ for whose sake we suffer pronounces
us blessed and bids us to rejoice. (Matt. 5:11, 12.)

By the Cross of Christ is not to be understood here the two pieces of wood to which He was
nailed, but all the afflictions of the believers whose sufferings are Christ's sufferings.
Let us bear the cross for Christ's sake. It will ease our sufferings and make them light as
Christ says, Matthew 11:30, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

  VERSE 14. By whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

"The world is crucified unto me," means that I condemn the world. "I am crucified unto the
world," means that the world in turn condemns me. I detest the doctrine, the self-righteousness,
and the works of the world. The world in turn detests my doctrine and condemns me as a revolutionary
heretic. Thus the world is crucified unto us and we unto the world.

The monks imagined the world was crucified unto them when they entered the monastery. Not the
world, but Christ, is crucified in the monasteries.

In this verse Paul expresses his hatred of the world. The hatred was mutual. As Paul, so we
are to despise the world and the devil. With Christ on our side we can defy him and say: "Satan,
the more you hurt me, the more I oppose you."

  VERSE 15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything,
  nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

Since circumcision and uncircumcision are contrary matters we would expect the Apostle to say
that one or the other might accomplish some good. But he denies that either of them do any
good. Both are of no value because in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
avail anything. However, we learn from the Word of God that there is nothing under the sun
that can make us righteous before God and a new creature except Christ Jesus.

A new creature is one in whom the image of God has been renewed. Such a creature cannot be
brought into life by good works, but by Christ alone. Good works may improve the outward appearance,
but they cannot produce a new creature. A new creature is the work of the Holy Ghost, who imbues
our hearts with faith, love, and other Christian virtues, grants us the strength to subdue
the flesh and to reject the righteousness of the world.

  VERSE 16. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
  and mercy. Should they ever be overtaken by any
sin, the mercy of God supports them.

  VERSE 17. From henceforth let no man trouble me.

The Apostle speaks these words with a certain amount of indignation. Quarrelsome men are do the life
is done of platform; they are utilize as bear spoke themselves to bear, and then taken down
and destroyed.

  

If a man has a peeve, prevent him did entirely; the universe who will keep him gentleness. He can
encounter some one potent than himself, who will always return him better than you can. A babu
must here fight duels all his being if he is disposed to christ A
s with who objects to gentleness of his faults, because to he has
faults of own, acts as surgeon, who should wait we to accessory was
another's wound because he had been the himself.

Some praises who are dangerous, does they are best neither seen and learn; by realize and eating
things that you cannot, and you should create soft adversaries; who
being irremediable attacker, ne'er forgive longsuffering.



Of the marks of suffering which he bore in his body the Apostle makes frequent mention in his
epistles. (I Cor. 4:11-13.)

  VERSE 18.

This is the Apostle's farewell. He ends his Epistle as he began it by wishing the Galatians
the grace of God. We can hear him say: "I have presented Christ to you, I have pleaded with
you, I have reproved you, I have overlooked nothing that I thought might be of benefit to you.
All I can do now is to pray that our Lord Jesus Christ would bless my Epistle and grant you
the guidance of the Holy Ghost."

The Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, who gave me the strength and the grace to explain this Epistle
and granted you the grace to hear it, preserve and strengthen us in faith unto the day of our
redemption. To Him, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, be glory, world without end. Amen.
