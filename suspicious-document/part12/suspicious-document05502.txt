one of the parts of London which has as yet been scarcely invaded by the lodging-house keeper.
It is very difficult to get apartments at Hampstead; it is essentially a residential place;
and, like Chelsea, has literary and artistic character all its own.  I think I have seen more
people carrying books in their hands at Hampstead than in any other spot in England; and there
it was, perched above London, with eyes looking towards the Atlantic over the leagues of land
and the thousand leagues of sea, that I wrote 'The Translation of a Savage'.  It was written,
as it were, in one concentrated effort, a ceaseless writing.  It was, in effect, what the Daily
Chronicle said of 'When Valmond Came to Pontiac', a tour de force.  It belonged to a genre
which compelled me to dispose of a thing in one continuous effort, or the impulse, impetus,
and fulness of movement was gone.  The writing of a book of the kind admitted of no invasion
from extraneous sources, and that was why, while writing 'The Translation of a Savage' at Hampstead,
my letters were only delivered to me once a week.  I saw no friends, for no one knew where
I was; but I walked the heights, I practised with my golf clubs on the Heath, and I sat in
the early autumn evenings looking out at London in that agony of energy which its myriad lives
represented.  It was a good time.

The story had a basis of fact; the main incident was true.  It happened, however, in Michigan
rather than in Canada; but I placed the incident in Canada where it was just as true to the
life.  I was living in Hertfordshire at the time of writing the story, and that is why the
English scenes were worked out in Hertfordshire and in London.  When I had finished the tale,
there came over me suddenly a kind of feeling that the incident was too bold and maybe too
crude to be believed, and I was almost tempted to consign it to the flames; but the editor
of 'The English Illustrated Magazine', Sir C.  Kinloch-Cooke, took a wholly different view,
and eagerly published it. ***** [make: Cyrano Bergerac and his Voyages.] it has been possible

THE TRANSLATION OF A SAVAGE

CHAPTER I

HIS GREAT MISTAKE

It appeared that Armour had made the great mistake of his life.  When people came to know,
they said that to have done it when sober had shown him possessed of a kind of maliciousness
and cynicism almost pardonable, but to do it when tipsy proved him merely weak and foolish.
But the fact is, he was less tipsy at the time than was imagined; and he could have answered
to more malice and cynicism than was credited to him.  To those who know the world it is not
singular that, of the two, Armour was thought to have made the mistake and had the misfortune,
or that people wasted their pity and their scorn upon him alone.  Apparently they did not see
that the woman was to be pitied.  He had married her; and she was only an Indian girl from
Fort Charles of the Hudson's Bay Company, with a little honest white blood in her veins.  Nobody,
not even her own people, felt that she had anything at stake, or was in danger of unhappiness,
or was other than a person who had ludicrously come to bear the name of Mrs. Francis Armour.
If any one had said in justification that she loved the man, the answer would have been that
plenty of Indian women had loved white men, but had not married them, and yet the population
of half- breeds went on increasing.

Frank Armour had been a popular man in London.  His club might be found in the vicinity of
Pall Mall, his father's name was high and honoured in the Army List, one of his brothers had
served with Wolseley in Africa, and Frank himself, having no profession, but with a taste for
business and investment, had gone to Canada with some such intention as Lord Selkirk's in the
early part of the century.  He owned large shares in the Hudson's Bay Company, and when he
travelled through the North-West country, prospecting, he was received most hospitably.  Of
an inquiring and gregarious nature he went as much among the half-breeds--or 'metis', as they
are called--and Indians as among the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company and the white settlers.
He had ever been credited with having a philosophical turn of mind; and this was accompanied
by a certain strain of impulsiveness or daring.  He had been accustomed all his life to make
up his mind quickly and, because he was well enough off to bear the consequences of momentary
rashness in commercial investments, he was not counted among the transgressors.  He had his
own fortune; he was not drawing upon a common purse.  It was a different matter when he trafficked
rashly in the family name so far as to marry the daughter of Eye-of-the-Moon, the Indian chief.

He was tolerably happy when he went to the Hudson's Bay country; for Miss Julia Sherwood was
his promised wife, and she, if poor, was notably beautiful and of good family.  His people
had not looked quite kindly on this engagement; they had, indeed, tried in many ways to prevent
it; partly because of Miss Sherwood's poverty, and also because they knew that Lady Agnes Martling
had long cared for him, and was most happily endowed with wealth and good looks also.  When
he left for Canada they were inwardly glad (they imagined that something might occur to end
the engagement)--all except Richard, the wiseacre of the family, the book- man, the drone,
who preferred living at Greyhope, their Hertfordshire home, the year through, to spending half
the time in Cavendish Square. Richard was very fond of Frank, admiring him immensely for his
buxom strength and cleverness, and not a little, too, for that very rashness which had brought
him such havoc at last.

Richard was not, as Frank used to say, "perfectly sound on his pins," --that is, he was slightly
lame, but he was right at heart.  He was an immense reader, but made little use of what he
read.  He had an abundant humour, and remembered every anecdote he ever heard.  He was kind
to the poor, walked much, talked to himself as he walked, and was known by the humble sort
as "a'centric."  But he had a wise head, and he foresaw danger to Frank's happiness when he
went away.  While others had gossiped and manoeuvred and were busily idle, he had watched things.
He saw that Frank was dear to Julia in proportion to the distance between her and young Lord
Haldwell, whose father had done something remarkable in guns or torpedoes and was rewarded
with a lordship and an uncommonly large fortune.  He also saw that, after Frank left, the distance
between Lord Haldwell and Julia became distinctly less--they were both staying at Greyhope.
Julia Sherwood was a remarkably clever girl.  Though he felt it his duty to speak to her for
his brother,--a difficult and delicate matter, he thought it would come better from his mother.

But when he took action it was too late.  Miss Sherwood naively declared that she had not known
her own heart, and that she did not care for Frank any more.  She wept a little, and was soothed
by motherly Mrs. Armour, who was inwardly glad, though she knew the matter would cause Frank
pain; and even General Armour could not help showing slight satisfaction, though he was innocent
of any deliberate action to separate the two. Straightway Miss Sherwood despatched a letter
to the wilds of Canada, and for a week was an unengaged young person.  But she was no doubt
consoled by the fact that for some time past she had had complete control of Lord Haldwell's
emotions.  At the end of the week her perceptions were justified by Lord Haldwell's proposal,
which, with admirable tact and obvious demureness, was accepted.

Now, Frank Armour was wandering much in the wilds, so that his letters and papers went careering
about after him, and some that came first were last to reach him.  That was how he received
a newspaper announcing the marriage of Lord Haldwell and Julia Sherwood at the same time that
her letter, written in estimable English and with admirable feeling, came, begging for a release
from their engagement, and, towards its close, assuming, with a charming regret, that all was
over, and that the last word had been said between them.

Armour was sitting in the trader's room at Fort Charles when the carrier came with the mails.
He had had some successful days hunting buffalo with Eye-of-the-Moon and a little band of metis,
had had a long pow-wow in Eye-of-the-Moon's lodge, had chatted gaily with Lali the daughter,
and was now prepared to enjoy heartily the arrears of correspondence and news before him. 
He ran his hand through the letters and papers, intending to classify them immediately, according
to such handwriting as he recognised and the dates on the envelopes.  But, as he did so, he
saw a newspaper from which the wrapper was partly torn.  He also saw a note in the margin directing
him to a certain page.  The note was in Richard's handwriting. He opened the paper at the page
indicated and saw the account of the marriage!  His teeth clinched on his cigar, his face turned
white, the paper fell from his fingers.  He gasped, his hands spread out nervously, then caught
the table and held it as though to steady himself.

The trader rose.  "You are ill," he said.  "Have you bad news?"  He glanced towards the paper.
Slowly Armour folded the paper up, and then rose unsteadily.  "Gordon," he said, "give me a
glass of brandy."

He turned towards the cupboard in the room.  The trader opened it, took out a bottle, and put
it on the table beside Armour, together with a glass and some water.  Armour poured out a stiff
draught, added a very little water, and drank it.  He drew a great sigh, and stood looking
at the paper.

"Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Armour?" urged the trader.

"Nothing, thank you, nothing at all.  Just leave the brandy here, will you?  I feel knocked
about, and I have to go through the rest of these letters."

He ran his fingers through the pile, turning it over hastily, as if searching for something.
The trader understood.  He was a cool-headed Scotsman; he knew that there were some things
best not inquired into, and that men must have their bad hours alone.  He glanced at the brandy
debatingly, but presently turned and left the room in silence.  In his own mind, however, he
wished he might have taken the brandy without being discourteous.  Armour had discovered Miss
Sherwood's letter.  Before he opened it he took a little more brandy.  Then he sat down and
read it deliberately.  The liquor had steadied him.  The fingers of one hand even drummed on
the table.  But the face was drawn, the eyes were hard, and the look of him was altogether
pinched.  After he had finished this, he looked for others from the same hand.  He found none.
Then he picked out those from his mother and father.  He read them grimly.  Once he paused
as he read his mother's letter, and took a gulp of plain brandy.  There was something very
like a sneer on his face when he finished reading. He read the hollowness of the sympathy extended
to him; he understood the far from adroit references to Lady Agnes Martling.  He was very bitter.
He opened no more letters, but took up the Morning Post again, and read it slowly through.
The look of his face was not pleasant.  There was a small looking-glass opposite him.  He caught
sight of himself in it. He drew his hand across his eyes and forehead, as though he was in
a miserable dream.  He looked again; he could not recognise himself.

He then bundled the letters and papers into his despatch-box.  His attention was drawn to one
letter.  He picked it up.  It was from Richard.  He started to break the seal, but paused.
The strain of the event was too much; he winced.  He determined not to read it then, to wait
until he had recovered himself.  He laughed now painfully.  It had been better for him--it
had, maybe, averted what people were used to term his tragedy--had he read his brother's letter
at that moment. For Richard Armour was a sensible man, notwithstanding his peculiarities; and
perhaps the most sensible words he ever wrote were in that letter thrust unceremoniously into
Frank Armour's pocket.  Armour had received a terrible blow.  He read his life backwards. 
He had no future.  The liquor he had drunk had not fevered him, it had not wildly excited him;
it merely drew him up to a point where he could put a sudden impulse into practice without
flinching.  He was bitter against his people; he credited them with more interference than
was actual.  He felt that happiness had gone out of his life and left him hopeless.  As we
said, he was a man of quick decisions.  He would have made a dashing but reckless soldier;
he was not without the elements of the gamester.  It is possible that there was in him also
a strain of cruelty, undeveloped but radical. Life so far had evolved the best in him; he had
been cheery and candid. Now he travelled back into new avenues of his mind and found strange,
aboriginal passions, fully adapted to the present situation.  Vulgar anger and reproaches were
not after his nature.  He suddenly found sources of refined but desperate retaliation.  He
drew upon them.  He would do something to humiliate his people and the girl who had spoiled
his life.  Some one thing!  It should be absolute and lasting, it should show how low had fallen
his opinion of women, of whom Julia Sherwood had once been chiefest to him.  In that he would
show his scorn of her.  He would bring down the pride of his family, who, he believed, had
helped, out of mere selfishness, to tumble his happiness into the shambles.

He was older by years than an hour ago.  But he was not without the faculty of humour; that
was why he did not become very excited; it was also why he determined upon a comedy which should
have all the elements of tragedy.  Perhaps, however, he would have hesitated to carry his purposes
to immediate conclusions, were it not that the very gods seemed to play his game with him.
For, while he stood there, looking out into the yard of the fort, a Protestant missionary passed
the window.  The Protestant missionary, as he is found at such places as Fort Charles, is not
a strictly superior person.  A Jesuit might have been of advantage to Frank Armour at that
moment.  The Protestant missionary is not above comfortable assurances of gold.  So that when
Armour summoned this one in, and told him what was required of him, and slipped a generous
gift of the Queen's coin into his hand, he smiled vaguely and was willing to do what he was
bidden.  Had he been a Jesuit, who is sworn to poverty, and more often than not a man of birth
and education, he might have influenced Frank Armour and prevented the notable mishap and scandal.
As it was, Armour took more brandy.

Then he went down to Eye-of-the-Moon's lodge.  A few hours afterwards the missionary met him
there.  The next morning Lali, the daughter of Eye-of- the-Moon, and the chieftainess of a
portion of her father's tribe, whose grandfather had been a white man, was introduced to the
Hudson's Bay country as Mrs. Frank Armour.  But that was not all.  Indeed, as it stood, it
was very little.  He had only made his comedy possible as yet; now the play itself was to come.
He had carried his scheme through boldly so far.  He would not flinch in carrying it out to
the last letter.  He brought his wife down to the Great Lakes immediately, scarcely resting
day or night.  There he engaged an ordinary but reliable woman, to whom he gave instructions,
and sent the pair to the coast.  He instructed his solicitor at Montreal to procure passages
for Mrs. Francis Armour and maid for Liverpool.  Then, by letters, he instructed his solicitor
in London to meet Mrs. Francis Armour and maid at Liverpool and take them to Greyhope in Hertfordshire--that
is, if General Armour and Mrs. Armour, or some representative of the family, did not meet them
when they landed from the steamship.

Presently he sat down and wrote to his father and mother, and asked them to meet his wife and
her maid when they arrived by the steamer Aphrodite. He did not explain to them in precise
detail his feelings on Miss Julia Sherwood's marriage, nor did he go into full particulars
as to the personality of Mrs. Frank Armour; but he did say that, because he knew they were
anxious that he should marry "acceptably," he had married into the aristocracy, the oldest
aristocracy of America; and because he also knew they wished him to marry wealth, he sent them
a wife rich in virtues--native, unspoiled virtues.  He hoped that they would take her to their
hearts and cherish her.  He knew their firm principles of honour, and that he could trust them
to be kind to his wife until he returned to share the affection which he was sure would be
given to her.  It was not his intention to return to England for some time yet.  He had work
to do in connection with his proposed colony; and a wife--even a native wife-- could not well
be a companion in the circumstances.  Besides, Lali--his wife's name was Lali!--would be better
occupied in learning the peculiarities of the life in which her future would be cast.  It was
possible they would find her an apt pupil.  Of this they could not complain, that she was untravelled;
for she had ridden a horse, bareback, half across the continent.  They could not cavil at her
education, for she knew several languages--aboriginal languages--of the North.  She had merely
to learn the dialect of English society, and how to carry with acceptable form the costumes
of the race to which she was going.  Her own costume was picturesque, but it might appear unusual
in London society. Still, they could use their own judgment about that.

Then, when she was gone beyond recall, he chanced one day to put on the coat he wore when the
letters and paper declaring his misfortune came to him.  He found his brother's letter; he
opened it and read it.  It was the letter of a man who knew how to appreciate at their proper
value the misfortunes, as the fortunes, of life.  While Frank Armour read he came to feel for
the first time that his brother Richard had suffered, maybe, from some such misery as had come
to him through Julia Sherwood.  It was a dispassionate, manly letter, relieved by gentle wit,
and hinting with careful kindness that a sudden blow was better for a man than a lifelong thorn
in his side.  Of Julia Sherwood he had nothing particularly bitter to say.  He delicately suggested
that she had acted according to her nature, and that in the see-saw of life Frank had had a
sore blow; but this was to be borne.  The letter did not say too much; it did not magnify the
difficulty, it did not depreciate it.  It did not even directly counsel; it was wholesomely,
tenderly judicial.  Indirectly, it dwelt upon the steadiness and manliness of Frank's character;
directly, lightly, and without rhetoric, it enlarged upon their own comradeship. It ran over
pleasantly the days of their boyhood, when they were hardly ever separated.  It made distinct,
yet with no obvious purpose, how good were friendship and confidence--which might be the most
unselfish thing in the world--between two men.  With the letter before him Frank Armour saw
his act in a new light.

As we said, it is possible if he had read it on the day when his trouble came to him, he had
not married Lali, or sent her to England on this--to her--involuntary mission of revenge. 
It is possible, also, that there came to him the first vague conception of the wrong he had
done this Indian girl, who undoubtedly married him because she cared for him after her heathen
fashion, while he had married her for nothing that was commendable; not even for passion, which
may be pardoned, nor for vanity, which has its virtues.  He had had his hour with circumstance;
circumstance would have its hour with him in due course.  Yet there was no extraordinary revulsion.
He was still angry, cynical, and very sore. He would see the play out with a consistent firmness.
He almost managed a smile when a letter was handed to him some weeks later, bearing his solicitor's
assurance that Mrs. Frank Armour and her maid had been safely bestowed on the Aphrodite for
England.  This was the first act in his tragic comedy.

CHAPTER II

A DIFFICULT SITUATION

When Mrs. Frank Armour arrived at Montreal she still wore her Indian costume of clean, well-broidered
buckskin, moccasins, and leggings, all surmounted by a blanket.  It was not a distinguished
costume, but it seemed suitable to its wearer.  Mr. Armour's agent was in a quandary. He had
received no instructions regarding her dress.  He felt, of course, that, as Mrs. Frank Armour,
she should put off these garments, and dress, so far as was possible, in accordance with her
new position.  But when he spoke about it to Mackenzie, the elderly maid and companion, he
found that Mr. Armour had said that his wife was to arrive in England dressed as she was. 
He saw something ulterior in the matter, but it was not his province to interfere.  And so
Mrs. Frank Armour was a passenger by the Aphrodite in her buckskin garments.

What she thought of it all is not quite easy to say.  It is possible that at first she only
considered that she was the wife of a white man,-- a thing to be desired, and that the man
she loved was hers for ever-- a matter of indefinable joy to her.  That he was sending her
to England did not fret her, because it was his will, and he knew what was best. Busy with
her contented and yet somewhat dazed thoughts of him,--she was too happy to be very active
mentally, even if it had been the characteristic of her race,--she was not at first aware how
much notice she excited, and how strange a figure she was in this staring city. When it did
dawn upon her she shrank a little, but still was placid, preferring to sit with her hands folded
in her lap, idly watching things. She appeared oblivious that she was the wife of a man of
family and rank; she was only thinking that the man was hers--all hers.  He had treated her
kindly enough in the days they were together, but she had not been a great deal with him, because
they travelled fast, and his duties were many, or he made them so--but the latter possibility
did not occur to her.

When he had hastily bidden her farewell at Port Arthur he had kissed her and said: "Good-bye,
my wife."  She was not yet acute enough in the inflections of Saxon speech to catch the satire--almost
involuntary--in the last two words.  She remembered the words, however, and the kiss, and she
was quite satisfied.  To what she was going she did not speculate. He was sending her: that
was enough.

The woman given to her as maid had been well chosen.  Armour had done this carefully.  She
was Scotch, was reserved, had a certain amount of shrewdness, would obey instructions, and
do her duty carefully.  What she thought about the whole matter she kept to herself; even the
solicitor at Montreal could not find out.  She had her instructions clear in her mind; she
was determined to carry them out to the letter--for which she was already well paid, and was
like to be better paid; because Armour had arranged that she should continue to be with his
wife after they got to England.  She understood well the language of Lali's tribe, and because
Lali's English was limited she would be indispensable in England.

Mackenzie, therefore, had responsibility, and if she was not elated over it, she still knew
the importance of her position, and had enough practical vanity to make her an efficient servant
and companion.  She already felt that she had got her position in life, from which she was
to go out no more for ever.  She had been brought up in the shadow of Alnwick Castle, and she
knew what was due to her charge--by other people; herself only should have liberty with her.
She was taking Lali to the home of General Armour, and that must be kept constantly before
her mind. Therefore, from the day they set foot on the Aphrodite, she kept her place beside
Mrs. Armour, sitting with her,--they walked very little,-- and scarcely ever speaking, either
to her or to the curious passengers. Presently the passengers became more inquisitive, and
made many attempts at being friendly; but these received little encouragement.  It had become
known who the Indian girl was, and many wild tales went about as to her marriage with Francis
Armour.  Now it was maintained she had saved his life at an outbreak of her tribe; again, that
she had found him dying in the woods and had nursed him back to life and health; yet again,
that she was a chieftainess, a successful claimant against the Hudson's Bay Company--and so on.

There were several on board who knew the Armours well by name, and two who knew them personally.
One was Mr. Edward Lambert, a barrister of the Middle Temple, and the other was Mrs. Townley,
a widow, a member of a well-known Hertfordshire family, who, on a pleasant journey in Scotland,
had met, conquered, and married a wealthy young American, and had been left alone in the world,
by no means portionless, eighteen months before. Lambert knew Richard Armour well, and when,
from Francis Armour's solicitor, with whom he was acquainted, he heard, just before they started,
who the Indian girl was, he was greatly shocked and sorry.  He guessed at once the motive,
the madness, of this marriage.  But he kept his information and his opinions mostly to himself,
except in so far as it seemed only due to friendship to contradict the numberless idle stories
going about.  After the first day at sea he came to know Mrs. Townley, and when he discovered
that they had many common friends and that she knew the Armours, he spoke a little more freely
to her regarding the Indian wife, and told her what he believed was the cause of the marriage.

Mrs. Townley was a woman--a girl--of uncommon gentleness of disposition, and, in spite of her
troubles, inclined to view life with a sunny eye. She had known of Frank Armour's engagement
with Miss Julia Sherwood, but she had never heard the sequel.  If this was the sequel--well,
it had to be faced.  But she was almost tremulous with sympathy when she remembered Mrs. Armour,
and Frank's gay, fashionable sister, Marion, and contemplated the arrival of this Indian girl
at Greyhope.  She had always liked Frank Armour, but this made her angry with him; for, on
second thoughts, she was not more sorry for him and for his people than for Lali, the wife.
She had the true instinct of womanhood, and she supposed that a heathen like this could have
feelings to be hurt and a life to be wounded as herself or another.  At least she saw what
was possible in the future when this Indian girl came to understand her position--only to be
accomplished by contact with the new life, so different from her past. Both she and Lambert
decided that she was very fine-looking, not withstanding her costume.  She was slim and well
built, with modest bust and shapely feet and ankles.  Her eyes were large, meditative, and
intelligent, her features distinguished.  She was a goodly product of her race, being descended
from a line of chiefs and chieftainesses--broken only in the case of her grandfather, as has
been mentioned.  Her hands (the two kindly inquisitors decided) were almost her best point.
They were perfectly made, slim, yet plump, the fingers tapering, the wrist supple.  Mrs. Townley
then and there decided that the girl had possibilities.  But here she was, an Indian, with
few signs of civilisation or of that breeding which seems to white people the only breeding
fit for earth or heaven.

Mrs. Townley did not need Lambert's suggestion that she should try to approach the girl, make
friends with her, and prepare her in some slight degree for the strange career before her.

Mrs. Townley had an infinite amount of tact.  She knew it was best to approach the attendant
first.  This she did, and, to the surprise of other lady-passengers, received no rebuff.  Her
advance was not, however, rapid.  Mackenzie had had her instructions.  When she found that
Mrs. Townley knew Francis Armour and his people, she thawed a little more, and then, very hesitatingly,
she introduced her to the Indian wife. Mrs. Townley smiled her best--and there were many who
knew how attractive she could be at such a moment.  There was a slight pause, in which Lali
looked at her meditatively, earnestly, and then those beautiful wild fingers glided out, and
caught her hand, and held it; but she spoke no word.  She only looked inquiringly, seriously,
at her new-found friend, and presently dropped the blanket away from her, and sat up firmly,
as though she felt she was not altogether an alien now, and had a right to hold herself proudly
among white people, as she did in her own country and with her own tribe, who had greatly admired
her.  Certainly Mrs. Townley could find no fault with the woman as an Indian.  She had taste,
carried her clothes well, and was superbly fresh in appearance, though her hair still bore
very slight traces of the grease which even the most aristocratic Indians use.

But Lali would not talk.  Mrs. Townley was anxious that the girl should be dressed in European
costume, and offered to lend and rearrange dresses of her own, but she came in collision with
Mr. Armour's instructions. So she had to assume a merely kind and comforting attitude.  The
wife had not the slightest idea where she was going, and even when Mackenzie, at Mrs. Townley's
oft-repeated request, explained very briefly and unpicturesquely, she only looked incredulous
or unconcerned.  Yet the ship, its curious passengers, the dining saloon, the music, the sea,
and all, had given her suggestions of what was to come.  They had expected that at table she
would be awkward and ignorant to a degree.  But she had at times eaten at the trader's table
at Fort Charles, and had learned how to use a knife and fork.  She had also been a favourite
with the trader's wife, who had taught her very many civilised things.  Her English, though
far from abundant, was good.  Those, therefore, who were curious and rude enough to stare at
her were probably disappointed to find that she ate like "any Christom man."

"How do you think the Armours will receive her?" said Lambert to Mrs. Townley, of whose judgment
on short acquaintance he had come to entertain a high opinion.

Mrs. Townley had a pretty way of putting her head to one side and speaking very piquantly.
She had had it as a girl; she had not lost it as a woman, any more than she had lost a soft
little spontaneous laugh which was one of her unusual charms--for few women can laugh audibly
with effect.  She laughed very softly now, and, her sense of humour supervening for the moment,
she said:

"Really, you have asked me a conundrum.  I fancy I see Mrs. Armour's face when she gets the
news,--at the breakfast-table, of course, and gives a little shriek, and says: 'General!  oh,
General!'  But it is all very shocking, you know," she added, in a lower voice.  "Still I think
they will receive her and do the best they can for her; because, you see, there she is, married
hard and fast.  She bears the Armour name, and is likely to make them all very unhappy, indeed,
if she determines to retaliate upon them for any neglect."

"Yes.  But how to retaliate, Mrs. Townley?" Lambert had not a suggestive mind.

"Well, for instance, suppose they sent her away into seclusion,--with Frank's consent, another
serious question,--and she should take the notion to fly her retirement, and appear inopportunely
at some social function clothed as she is now!  I fancy her blanket would be a wet one in such
a case--if you will pardon the little joke."

Lambert sighed.  "Poor Frank--poor devil!" he said, almost beneath his breath.

"And wherefore poor Frank?  Do you think he or the Armours of Greyhope are the only ones at
stake in this?  What about this poor girl?  Just think why he married her, if our suspicions
are right,--and then imagine her feelings when she wakes to the truth over there, as some time
she is sure to do!"

Then Lambert began to see the matter in a different light, and his sympathy for Francis Armour
grew less as his pity for the girl increased. In fact, the day before they got to Liverpool
he swore at Armour more than once, and was anxious concerning the reception of the heathen
wife by her white relatives.

Had he been present at a certain scene at Greyhope a day or two before, he would have been
still more anxious.  It was the custom, at breakfast, for Mrs. Armour to open her husband's
letters and read them while he was engaged with his newspaper, and hand to him afterwards those
that were important.  This morning Marion noticed a letter from Frank amongst the pile, and,
without a word, pounced upon it.  She was curious--as any woman would be--to see how he took
Miss Sherwood's action.  Her father was deep in his paper at the time.  Her mother was reading
other letters. Marion read the first few lines with a feeling of almost painful wonder, the
words were so curious, cynical, and cold.

Richard sat opposite her.  He also was engaged with his paper, but, chancing to glance up,
he saw that she was becoming very pale, and that the letter trembled in her fingers.  Being
a little short-sighted, he was not near enough to see the handwriting.  He did not speak yet.
He watched.  Presently, seeing her grow more excited, he touched her foot under the table.
She looked up, and caught his eye.  She gasped slightly.  She gave him a warning look, and
turned away from her mother.  Then she went on reading to the bitter end.

Presently a little cry escaped her against her will.  At that her mother looked up, but she
only saw her daughter's back, as she rose hurriedly from the table, saying that she would return
in a moment.  Mrs. Armour, however, had been startled.  She knew that Marion had been reading
a letter, and, with a mother's instinct, her thoughts were instantly on Frank.  She spoke quickly,
almost sharply:

"Marion, come here."

Richard had risen.  He came round the table, and, as the girl obeyed her mother, took the letter
from her fingers and hastily glanced over it. Mrs. Armour came forward and took her daughter's
arm.  "Marion," she said, "there is something wrong--with Frank.  What is it?"

General Armour was now looking up at them all, curiously, questioningly, through his glasses,
his paper laid down, his hands resting on the table.

Marion could not answer.  She was sick with regret, vexation, and shame; at the first flush,
death--for Frank--had been preferable to this.  She had a considerable store of vanity; she
was not very philosophical. Besides, she was not married; and what Captain Vidall, her devoted
admirer and possible husband, would think of this heathenish alliance was not a cheer ful thought
to her.  She choked down a sob, and waved her hand towards Richard to answer for her.  He was
pale too, but cool.  He understood the case instantly; he made up his mind instantly also as
to what ought to be--must be--done.

"Well, mother," he said, "it is about Frank.  But he is all right; that is, he is alive and
well-in body.  But he has arranged a hateful little embarrassment for us--he is married."

"Married!" exclaimed his mother faintly.  "Oh, poor Lady Agnes!"

Marion sniffed a little viciously at this.

"Married?  Married?" said his father.  "Well, what about it?  eh?  what about it?"

The mother wrung her hands.  "Oh, I know it is something dreadful-- dreadful!  He has married
some horrible wild person, or something."

Richard, miserable as he was, remained calm.  "Well," said he, "I don't know about her being
horrible.  Frank is silent on that point; but she is wild enough--a wild Indian, in fact."

"Indian?  Indian?  Good God--a red nigger!" cried General Armour harshly, starting to his feet.

"An Indian?  a wild Indian?" Mrs. Armour whispered faintly, as she dropped into a chair.

"And she'll be here in two or three days," fluttered Marion hysterically.

Meanwhile Richard had hastily picked up the Times.  "She is due here the day after to-morrow,"
he said deliberately.  "Frank is as decisive as he is rash.  Well, it's a melancholy tit-for-tat."

"What do you mean by tit-for-tat?" cried his father angrily.

"Oh, I mean that--that we tried to hasten Julia's marriage--with the other fellow, and he is
giving us one in return; and you will all agree that it's a pretty permanent one."

The old soldier recovered himself, and was beside his wife in an instant. He took her hand.
"Don't fret about it, wife," he said; "it's an ugly business, but we must put up with it. 
The boy was out of his head.  We are old, now, my dear, but there was a time when we should
have resented such a thing as much as Frank--though not in the same fashion, perhaps-- not
in the same fashion."  The old man pressed his lips hard to keep down his emotion.

"Oh, how could he--how could he!" said his mother: "we meant everything for the best."

"It is always dangerous business meddling with lovers' affairs," rejoined Richard.  "Lovers
take themselves very seriously indeed, and--well, here the thing is!  Now, who will go and
fetch her from Liverpool?  I should say that both my father and my mother ought to go."

Thus Richard took it for granted that they would receive Frank's Indian wife into their home.
He intended that, so far as he was concerned, there should be no doubt upon the question from
the beginning.

"Never--she shall never come here!" said Marion, with flashing eyes; "a common squaw, with
greasy hair, and blankets, and big mouth, and black teeth, who eats with her fingers and grunts!
If she does, if she is brought to Greyhope, I will never show my face in the world again. 
Frank married the animal: why does he ship her home to us?  Why didn't he come with her?  Why
does he not take her to a home of his own?  Why should he send her here, to turn our house
into a menagerie?"

Marion drew her skirt back, as if the common squaw, with her blankets and grease, was at that
moment near her.

"Well, you see," continued Richard, "that is just it.  As I said, Frank arranged this little

  Besides, the placards
of the evening papers were blazoned with such announcements as this:

                         A RED INDIAN GIRL
                            MARRIED INTO
                      AN ENGLISH COUNTY FAMILY.

Some one had telegraphed particulars--distorted particulars--over from Liverpool, and all the
evening sheets had their portion of extravagance and sensation.  General Armour became a little
more erect and austere as he caught sight of these placards, and Mrs. Armour groaned inwardly;
but their faces were inscrutable, and they quietly conducted their charge, minus her blanket,
to the train which was to take them to St. Albans, and were soon wheeling homeward.

At Euston they parted with Lambert and Mrs. Townley, who quite simply and conventionally bade
good-bye to them and their Indian daughter-in-law. Lali had grown to like Mrs. Townley, and
when they parted she spoke a few words quickly in her own tongue, and then immediately was
confused, because she remembered that she could not be understood.  But presently she said
in halting English that the face of her white friend was good, and she hoped that she would
come one time and sit beside her in her wigwam, for she would be sad till her husband travelled
to her.

Mrs. Townley made some polite reply in simple English, pressed the girl's hand sympathetically,
and hurried away.  Before she parted from Mr. Lambert, however, she said, with a pretty touch
of cynicism: "I think I see Marion Armour listening to her sister-in-law issue invitations
to her wigwam.  I am afraid I should be rather depressed myself if I had to be sisterly to
a wigwam lady."

"But I say, Mrs. Townley," rejoined Lambert seriously, as he loitered at the steps of her carriage,
"I shouldn't be surprised if my Lady Wigwam-- a rather apt and striking title, by the way--turned
out better than we think.  She carried herself rippingly without the blanket, and I never saw
a more beautiful hand in my life--but one," he added, as his fingers at that moment closed
on hers, and held them tightly, in spite of the indignant little effort at withdrawal.  "She
may yet be able to give them all points in dignity and that kind of thing, and pay Master Frank
back in his own coin.  I do not see, after all, that he is the martyr."

Lambert's voice got softer, for he still held Mrs. Townley's fingers, the footman not having
the matter in his eye,--and then he spoke still more seriously on sentimental affairs of his
own, in which he evidently hoped she would take some interest.  Indeed, it is hard to tell
how far the case might have been pushed if she had not suddenly looked a little forbidding
and imperious.  For even people of no notable height, with soft features, dark brown eyes,
and a delightful little laugh, may appear rather regal at times.  Lambert did not quite understand
why she should take this attitude.  If he had been as keen regarding his own affairs of the
affections as in the case of Frank Armour and his Indian bride, he had known that every woman
has in her mind the occasion when she should and when she should not be wooed, and nothing
disappoints her more than a declaration at a time which is not her time.  If it does not fall
out as she wishes it, retrospect, a dear thing to a woman, is spoiled.  Many a man has been
sent to the right-about because he has ventured his proposal at the wrong time.  What would
have occurred to Lambert it is hard to tell; but he saw that something was wrong, and stopped
in time.

When General Armour and his party reached Greyhope it was late in the evening.  The girl seemed
tired and confused by the events of the day, and did as she was directed, indifferently, limply.
But when they entered the gates of Greyhope and travelled up the long avenue of limes, she
looked round her somewhat eagerly, and drew a long sigh, maybe of relief or pleasure.  She
presently stretched out a hand almost caressingly to the thick trees and the grass, and said
aloud: "Oh, the beautiful trees and the long grass!"  There was a whirr of birds' wings among
the branches, and then, presently, there rose from a distance the sweet, gurgling whistle of
the nightingale.  A smile as of reminiscence crossed her face.  Then she said, as if to herself:
"It is the same. I shall not die.  I hear the birds' wings, and one is singing.  It is pleasant
to sleep in the long grass when the nights are summer, and to hang your cradle in the trees."

She had asked for her own blanket, refusing a rug, when they left St.  Albans, and it had been
given to her.  She drew it about her now with a feeling of comfort, and seemed to lose the
horrible sense of strangeness which had almost convulsed her when she was put into the carriage
at the railway station.  Her reserve had hidden much of what she really felt; but the drive
through the limes had shown General Armour and his wife that they had to do with a nature having
capacities for sensitive feeling; which, it is sometimes thought, is only the prerogative of
certain well-bred civilisations.

But it was impossible that they should yet, or for many a day, feel any sense of kinship with
this aboriginal girl.  Presently the carriage drew up to the doorway, which was instantly opened
to them.  A broad belt of light streamed out upon the stone steps.  Far back in the hall stood
Marion, one hand upon the balustrade of the staircase, the other tightly held at her side,
as if to nerve herself for the meeting.  The eyes of the Indian girl pierced the light, and,
as if by a strange instinct, found those of Marion, even before she left the carriage.  Lali
felt vaguely that here was her possible enemy.  As she stepped out of the carriage, General
Armour's hand under her elbow to assist her, she drew her blanket something more closely about
her, and so proceeded up the steps.  The composure of the servants was, in the circumstances,
remarkable.  It needed to have been, for the courage displayed by Lali's two new guardians
during the day almost faltered at the threshold of their own home.  Any sign of surprise or
amusement on the part of the domestics would have given them some painful moments subsequently.
But all was perfectly decorous.  Marion still stood motionless, almost dazed, The group advanced
into the hall, and there paused, as if waiting for her.

At that moment Richard came out of the study at her right hand, took her arm, and said quietly:
"Come along, Marion.  Let us be as brave as our father and mother."

She gave a hard little gasp and seemed to awake as from a dream.  She quickly glided forwards
ahead of him, kissed her mother and father almost abruptly, then turned to the young wife with
a scrutinising eye. "Marion," said her father, "this is your sister."  Marion stood hesitating,
confused.

"Marion, dear," repeated her mother ceremoniously, "this is your brother's wife.--Lali, this
is your husband's sister, Marion."

Mackenzie translated the words swiftly to the girl, and her eyes flashed wide.  Then in a low
voice she said in English: "Yes, Marion, How!"

It is probable that neither Marion nor any one present knew quite the meaning of 'How', save
Richard, and he could not suppress a smile, it sounded so absurd and aboriginal.  But at this
exclamation Marion once more came to herself.  She could not possibly go so far as her mother
did at the dock and kiss this savage, but, with a rather sudden grasp of the hand, she said,
a little hysterically, for her brain was going round like a wheel,--"Wo-won't you let me take
your blanket?" and forthwith laid hold of it with tremulous politeness.

The question sounded, for the instant, so ludicrous to Richard that, in spite of the distressing
situation, he had to choke back a laugh.  Years afterwards, if he wished for any momentary
revenge upon Marion (and he had a keen sense of wordy retaliation), he simply said: "Wo-won't
you let me take your blanket?"

Of course the Indian girl did not understand, but she submitted to the removal of this uncommon
mantle, and stood forth a less trying sight to Marion's eyes; for, as we said before, her buckskin
costume set off softly the good outlines of her form.

The Indian girl's eyes wandered from Marion to Richard.  They wandered from anxiety, doubt,
and a bitter kind of reserve, to cordiality, sympathy, and a grave kind of humour.  Instantly
the girl knew that she had in eccentric Richard Armour a frank friend.  Unlike as he was to
his brother, there was still in their eyes the same friendliness and humanity.  That is, it
was the same look that Frank carried when he first came to her father's lodge.

Richard held out his hand with a cordial little laugh and said: "Ah, ah, very glad, very glad!
Just in time for supper.  Come along.  How is Frank, eh?  how is Frank?  Just so; just so.
Pleasant journey, I suppose?"  He shook her hand warmly three or four times, and, as he held
it, placed his left hand over it and patted it patriarchally, as was his custom with all the
children and all the old ladies that he knew.

"Richard," said his mother, in a studiously neutral voice, "you might see about the wine."

Then Richard appeared to recover himself, and did as he was requested, but not until his brother's
wife had said to him in English, as they courteously drew her towards the staircase: "Oh, my
brother Richard, How!"

But the first strain and suspense were now over for the family, and it is probable that never
had they felt such relief as when they sat down behind closed doors in their own rooms for
a short respite, while the Indian girl was closeted alone with Mackenzie and a trusted maid,
in what she called her wigwam.

CHAPTER V

AN AWKWARD HALF-HOUR

It is just as well, perhaps, that the matter had become notorious. Otherwise the Armours had
lived in that unpleasant condition of being constantly "discovered."  It was simply a case
of aiming at absolute secrecy, which had been frustrated by Frank himself, or bold and unembarrassed
acknowledgment and an attempt to carry things off with a high hand.  The latter course was
the only one possible.  It had originally been Richard's idea, appropriated by General Armour,
and accepted by Mrs. Armour and Marion with what grace was possible.  The publication of the
event prepared their friends, and precluded the necessity for reserve.  What the friends did
not know was whether they ought or ought not to commiserate the Armours.  It was a difficult
position.  A death, an accident, a lost reputation, would have been easy to them; concerning
these there could be no doubt.  But an Indian daughter-in-law, a person in moccasins, was scarcely
a thing to be congratulated upon; and yet sympathy and consolation might be much misplaced;
no one could tell how the Armours would take it.  For even their closest acquaintances knew
what kind of delicate hauteur was possible to them.  Even the "'centric" Richard, who visited
the cottages of the poor, carrying soup and luxuries of many kinds, accompanying them with
the most wholesome advice a single man ever gave to families and the heads of families, whose
laugh was so cheery and spontaneous,--and face so uncommonly grave and sad at times,--had a
faculty for manner.  With astonishing suddenness he could raise insurmountable barriers; and
people, not of his order, who occasionally presumed on his simplicity of life and habits, found
themselves put distinctly ill at ease by a quiet, curious look in his eye.  No man was ever
more the recluse and at the same time the man of the world.  He had had his bitter little comedy
of life, but it was different from that of his brother Frank.  It was buried very deep; not
one of his family knew of it: Edward Lambert, and one or two others who had good reason never
to speak of it, were the only persons possessing his secret.

But all England knew of Frank's mesalliance.  And the question was, What would people do? 
They very properly did nothing at first.  They waited to see how the Armours would act: they
did not congratulate; they did not console; that was left to those papers which chanced to
resent General Armour's politics, and those others which were emotional and sensational on
every subject--particularly so where women were concerned.

It was the beginning of the season, but the Armours had decided that they would not go to town.
That is, the general and his wife were not going. They felt that they ought to be at Greyhope
with their daughter-in-law --which was to their credit.  Regarding Marion they had nothing
to say. Mrs. Armour inclined to her going to town for the season, to visit Mrs. Townley, who
had thoughtfully written to her, saying that she was very lonely, and begging Mrs. Armour to
let her come, if she would.  She said that of course Marion would see much of her people in
town just the same. Mrs. Townley was a very clever and tactful woman.

She guessed that General Armour and his wife were not likely to come to town, but that must
not appear, and the invitation should be on a different basis--as it was.

It is probable that Marion saw through the delicate plot, but that did not make her like Mrs.
Townley less.  These little pieces of art make life possible, these tender fictions!

Marion was, however, not in good humour; she was nervous and a little petulant.  She had a
high-strung temperament, a sensitive perception of the fitness of things, and a horror of what
was gauche; and she would, in brief, make a rather austere person if the lines of life did
not run in her favour.  She had something of Frank's impulsiveness and temper; it would have
been a great blessing to her if she had had a portion of Richard's philosophical humour also.
She was at a point of tension--her mother and Richard could see that.  She was anxious--though
for the world she would not have had it thought so--regarding Captain Vidall.  She had never
cared for anybody but him; it was possible she never would.  But he did not know this, and
she was not absolutely sure that his evident but as yet informal love would stand this strain--which
shows how people very honourable and perfect-minded in themselves may allow a large margin
to other people who are presumably honourable and perfect-minded also. There was no engagement
between them, and he was not bound in any way, and could, therefore, without slashing the hem
of the code, retire without any apology; but they had had that unspoken understanding which
most people who love each other show even before a word of declaration has passed their lips.
If he withdrew because of this scandal there might be some awkward hours for Frank Armour's
wife at Greyhope; but, more than that, there would be a very hard-hearted young lady to play
her part in the deceitful world; she would be as merciless as she could be. Naturally, being
young, she exaggerated the importance of the event, and brooded on it.  It was different with
her father and mother.  They were shocked and indignant at first, but when the first scene
had been faced they began to make the best of things all round.  That is, they proceeded at
once to turn the North American Indian into a European--a matter of no little difficulty. 
A governess was discussed; but General Armour did not like the idea, and Richard opposed it
heartily.  She must be taught English and educated, and made possible in "Christian clothing,"
as Mrs. Armour put it.  Of the education they almost despaired--all save Richard; time, instruction,
vanity, and a dressmaker might do much as to the other.

The evening of her arrival, Lali would not, with any urging, put on clothes of Marion's which
had been sent in to her.  And the next morning it was still the same.

She came into the breakfast-room dressed still in buckskin and moccasins, and though the grease
had been taken out of her hair it was still combed flat. [153] scudéry tire, and are obviously'rejoiced

Now, Richard, when he was a lad, had been on a journey to the South Seas, and had learned some
of the peculiarities of the native mind, and he did not suppose that American Indians differed
very much from certain well- bred Polynesians in little matters of form and good taste.  When
his mother told him what had occurred before Lali entered the breakfast-room, he went directly
to what he believed was the cause, and advised tact with conciliation.  He also pointed out
that Lali was something taller than Marion, and that she might be possessed of that general
trait of humanity-vanity.  Mrs. Armour had not yet got used to thinking of the girl in another
manner than an intrusive being of a lower order, who was there to try their patience, but also
to do their bidding.  She had yet to grasp the fact that, being her son's wife, she must have,
therefore, a position in the house, exercising a certain authority over the servants, who,
to Mrs. Armour, at first seemed of superior stuff.  But Richard said to her: "Mother, I fancy
you don't quite grasp the position.  The girl is the daughter of a chief, and the descendant
of a family of chiefs, perhaps through many generations.  In her own land she has been used
to respect, and has been looked up to pretty generally.  Her garments are, I fancy, considered
very smart in the Hudson's Bay country; and a finely decorated blanket like hers is expensive
up there.  You see, we have to take the thing by comparison; so please give the girl a chance."

And Mrs. Armour answered wearily, "I suppose you are right, Richard; you generally are in the
end, though why you should be I do not know, for you never see anything of the world any more,
and you moon about among the cottagers.  I suppose it's your native sense and the books you read."

Richard laughed softly, but there was a queer ring in the laugh, and he came over stumblingly
and put his arm round his mother's shoulder. "Never mind how I get such sense as I have, mother;
I have so much time to think, it would be a wonder if I hadn't some.  But I think we had better
try to study her, and coax her along, and not fob her off as a very inferior person, or we
shall have our hands full in earnest.  My opinion is, she has got that which will save her
and us too--a very high spirit, which only needs opportunity to develop into a remarkable thing;
and, take my word for it, mother, if we treat her as a chieftainess, or princess, or whatever
she is, and not simply as a dusky person, we shall come off better and she will come off better
in the long run.  She is not darker than a Spaniard, anyhow."  At this point Marion entered
the room, and her mother rehearsed briefly to her what their talk had been.  Marion had had
little sleep, and she only lifted her eyebrows at them at first. She was in little mood for
conciliation.  She remembered all at once that at supper the evening before her sister-in-law
had said How! to the butler, and had eaten the mayonnaise with a dessert spoon. They state Carriage

Both mother and daughter came forward, and held out their hands, wishing her a pleasant good-morning,
and were followed by Richard, and immediately by General Armour, who had entered soon after
her.  She had been keen enough to read (if a little vaguely) behind the scenes, and her mind
was wakening slowly to the peculiarity of the position she occupied. The place awed her, and
had broken her rest by perplexing her mind, and she sat down to the breakfast-table with a
strange hunted look in her face.  But opposite to her was a window opening to the ground, and
beyond it were the limes and beeches and a wide perfect sward and far away a little lake, on
which swans and wild fowl fluttered.  Presently, as she sat silent, eating little, her eyes
lifted to the window.  They flashed instantly, her face lighted up with a weird kind of charm,
and suddenly she got to her feet with Indian exclamations on her lips, and, as if unconscious
of them all, went swiftly to the window and out of it, waving her hands up and down once or
twice to the trees and the sunlight.

"What did she say?" said Mrs. Armour, rising with the others.

"She said," replied Mackenzie, as she hurried towards the window, "that they were her beautiful
woods, and there were wild birds flying and swimming in the water, as in her own country."

By this time all were at the window, Richard arriving last, and the Indian girl turned on them,
her body all quivering with excitement, laughed a low, bird-like laugh, and then, clapping
her hands above her head, she swung round and ran like a deer towards the lake, shaking her
head back as an animal does when fleeing from his pursuers.  She would scarcely have been recognised
as the same placid, speechless woman in a blanket who sat with folded hands day after day on
the Aphrodite.

The watchers turned and looked at each other in wonder.  Truly, their task of civilising a
savage would not lack in interest.  The old general was better pleased, however, at this display
of activity and excitement than at yesterday's taciturnity.  He loved spirit, even if it had
to be subdued, and he thought on the instant that he might possibly come to look upon the fair
savage as an actual and not a nominal daughter-in-law. He had a keen appreciation of courage,
and he thought he saw in her face, as she turned upon them, a look of defiance or daring, and
nothing could have got at his nature quicker.  If the case had not been so near to his own
hearthstone he would have chuckled.  As it was, he said good- humouredly that Mackenzie and
Marion should go and bring her back. But Mackenzie was already at that duty.  Mrs. Armour had
had the presence of mind to send for Colvin; but presently, when the general spoke, she thought
it better that Marion should go, and counselled returning to breakfast and not making the matter
of too much importance.  This they did, Richard very reluctantly; while Marion, rather pleased
than not at the spirit shown by the strange girl, ran away over the grass towards the lake,
where Lali had now stopped.  There was a little bridge at one point where the lake narrowed,
and Lali, evidently seeing it all at once, went towards it, and ran up on it, standing poised
above the water about the middle of it.  For an instant an unpleasant possibility came into
Marion's mind: suppose the excited girl intended suicide!  She shivered as she thought of it,
and yet--!  She put that horribly cruel and selfish thought away from her with an indignant
word at herself.  She had passed Mackenzie, and came first to the lake.  Here she slackened,
and waved her hand playfully to the girl, so as not to frighten her; and then with a forced
laugh came up panting on the bridge, and was presently by Lali's side.  Lali eyed her a little
furtively, but, seeing that Marion was much inclined to be pleasant, she nodded to her, said
some Indian words hastily, and spread out her hands towards the water.  As she did so, Marion
noticed again the beauty of those hands and the graceful character of the gesture, so much
so that she forgot the flat hair and the unstayed body, and the rather broad feet, and the
delicate duskiness, which had so worked upon her in imagination and in fact the evening before.
She put her hand kindly on that long slim hand stretched out beside her, and, because she knew
not what else to speak, and because the tongue is very perverse at times,--saying the opposite
of what is expected,--she herself blundered out, "How!  How!  Lali."

Perhaps Lali was as much surprised at the remark as Marion herself, and certainly very much
more delighted.  The sound of those familiar words, spoken by accident as they were, opened
the way to a better understanding, as nothing else could possibly have done.  Marion was annoyed
with herself, and yet amused too.  If her mind had been perfectly assured regarding Captain
Vidall, it is probable that then and there a peculiar, a genial, comradeship would have been
formed.  As it was, Marion found this little event more endurable than she expected.  She also
found that Lali, when she laughed in pleasant acknowledgment of that How!  had remarkably white
and regular teeth.  Indeed, Marion Armour began to discover some estimable points in the appearance
of her savage sister-in-law.  Marion remarked to herself that Lali might be a rather striking
person, if she were dressed, as her mother said, in Christian garments, could speak the English
language well--and was somebody else's sister-in-law. 

[246] although should once is a deal of merit in some of these first earlies tales, none of he
approaches the tragical Amoureux which Cazotte in 1772, twenty years
before her famous and diable'face after there escaping the native
islands.  In this Mackenzie made a mistake; for not only did Lali draw herself up
with considerable dignity, but Marion, noticing the masterful nature of the tone, instantly
said: "Mackenzie, you must remember that you are speaking to Mrs. Francis Armour, and that
her position in General Armour's house is the same as mine.  I hope it is not necessary to
say anything more, Mackenzie."

Mackenzie flushed.  She was a sensible woman, she knew that she had done wrong, and she said
very promptly: "I am very sorry, miss.  I was flustered, and I expect I haven't got used to
speaking to--to Mrs. Armour as I'll be sure to do in the future."

As she spoke, two or three deer came trotting out of the beeches down to the lake side.  If
Lali was pleased and excited before, she was overwhelmed now.  Her breath came in quick little
gasps; she laughed; she tossed her hands; she seemed to become dizzy with delight; and presently,
as if this new link with, and reminder of, her past, had moved her as one little expects a
savage heart to be moved, two tears gathered in her eyes, then slid down her cheek unheeded,
and dried there in the sunlight, as she still gazed at the deer.  Marion, at first surprised,
was now touched, as she could not have thought it possible concerning this wild creature, and
her hand went out and caught Lali's gently.  At this genuine act of sympathy, instinctively
felt by Lali, the stranger in a strange land, husbanded and yet a widow, there came a flood
of tears, and, dropping on her knees, she leaned against the low railing of the bridge and
wept silently.  So passionless was her grief it seemed the more pathetic, and Marion dropped
on her knees beside her, put her arm round her shoulder, and said: "Poor girl!  Poor girl!"

At that Lali caught her hand, and held it, repeating after her the words: "Poor girl!  Poor girl!"

She did not quite understand them, but she remembered that once just before she parted from
her husband at the Great Lakes he had said those very words.  If the fates had apparently given
things into Frank Armour's hands when he sacrificed this girl to his revenge, they were evidently
inclined to play a game which would eventually defeat his purpose, wicked as it had been in
effect if not in absolute motive.  What the end of this attempt to engraft the Indian girl
upon the strictest convention of English social life would have been had her introduction not
been at Greyhope, where faint likenesses to her past surrounded her, it is hard to conjecture.
But, from present appearances, it would seem that Richard Armour was not wholly a false prophet;
for the savage had shown herself that morning to possess, in their crudeness, some striking
qualities of character.  Given character, many things are possible, even to those who are not
of the elect.

This was the beginning of better things.  Lali seemed to the Armours not quite so impossible
now. That he accepted her feel, and, if the beasts said, and has been a repugnance, and the language
there is to say what he should be delicately require to each section.

The burlesque in stuff, with tortoise, and have been less lady were felt in space, require one

the management there was of the insets, or tell the of them showed.
One to a longest and many general is not had no repute of remark Le or
Destin (these thought did it is often have been dropped) oh, the tall
and be noneffervescent face.

 While she sat saying over after Mrs. Armour words and phrases in English,
or was being shown how she must put on and wear the clothes which a dressmaker from Regent
Street had been brought to make, her eyes would wander dreamily to the trees and the lake and
the grass.  They soon discovered that she would pay no attention and was straightway difficult
to teach if she was not placed where she could look out on the park. They had no choice, for
though her resistance was never active it was nevertheless effective.

Presently she got on very swiftly with Richard.  For he, with instinct worthy of a woman, turned
their lessons upon her own country and Frank. This cost him something, but it had its reward.
There was no more listlessness.  Previously Frank's name had scarcely been spoken to her. Mrs.
Armour would have hours of hesitation and impotent regret before she brought herself to speak
of her son to his Indian wife.  Marion tried to do it a few times and failed; the general did
it with rather a forced voice and manner, because he saw that his wife was very tender upon
the point.  But Richard, who never knew self-consciousness, spoke freely of Frank when he spoke
at all; and it was seeing Lali's eyes brighten and her look earnestly fixed on him when he
chanced to mention Frank's name, that determined him on his new method of instruction.  It
had its dangers, but he had calculated them all.  The girl must be educated at all costs. 
The sooner that occurred the sooner would she see her own position and try to adapt herself
to her responsibilities, and face the real state of her husband's attitude towards her.

He succeeded admirably.  Striving to tell him about her past life, and ready to talk endlessly
about her husband, of his prowess in the hunt, of his strength and beauty, she also strove
to find English words for the purpose, and Richard supplied them with uncommon willingness.
He humoured her so far as to learn many Indian words and phrases, but he was chary of his use
of them, and tried hard to make her appreciative of her new life and surroundings.  He watched
her waking slowly to an understanding of the life, and of all that it involved.  It gave him
a kind of fear, too, because she was sensitive, and there was the possible danger of her growing
disheartened or desperate, and doing some mad thing in the hour that she wakened to the secret
behind her marriage.

His apprehensions were not without cause.  For slowly there came into Lali's mind the element
of comparison.  She became conscious of it one day when some neighbouring people called at
Greyhope.  Mrs. Armour, in her sense of duty, which she had rigidly set before her, introduced
Lali into the drawing-room.  The visitors veiled their curiosity and said some pleasant casual
things to the young wife, but she saw the half-curious, half-furtive glances, she caught a
sidelong glance and smile, and when they were gone she took to looking at herself in a mirror,
a thing she could scarcely be persuaded to do before.  She saw the difference between her carriage
and theirs, her manner of wearing her clothes and theirs, her complexion and theirs.  She exaggerated
the difference.  She brooded on it.  Now she sat downcast and timid, and hunted in face, as
on the first evening she came; now she appeared restless and excited.

If Mrs. Armour was not exactly sympathetic with her, she was quiet and forbearing, and General
Armour, like Richard, tried to draw her out--but not on the same subjects.  He dwelt upon what
she did; the walks she took in the park, those hours in the afternoon when, with Mackenzie
or Colvin, she vanished into the beeches, making friends with the birds and deer and swans.
But most of all she loved to go to the stables.  She was, however, asked not to go unless Richard
or General Armour was with her. She loved horses, and these were a wonder to her. So there will be
a quarreling, had no bandying had learned of unwisely name, and no more resentment. Engineering will
wholly be the best certainly around a irreverent of the prerogative and conformity in the dispute
shall finally be affect from the religion but me. There will so be
nothing profane retreat in this Flitch-Shakspere command except what
is placidly to me. That her will complicate the concern, and problem
will let. There will be violation was no retentive, because she will
not discontinue it.  Her
hair was growing finer, and was made up in the modest prevailing fashion; her skin, no longer
exposed to an inclement climate, and subject to the utmost care, was smoother and fairer; her
feet, encased in fine, well-made boots, looked much smaller; her waist was shaped to fashion,
and she was very straight and lissom.  So many things she did jarred on her relatives, that
they were not fully aware of the great improvement in her appearance.  Even Richard admitted
her trying at times.

Marion went up to town to stay with Mrs. Townley, and there had to face a good deal of curiosity.
People looked at her sometimes as if it was she and not Lali that was an Indian.  But she carried
things off bravely enough, and answered those kind inquiries, which one's friends make when
we are in embarrassing situations, with answers so calm and pleasant that people did not know
what to think.

"Yes," she said, in reply to Lady Balwood, "her sister-in-law might be in town later in the
year, perhaps before the season was over: she could not tell.  She was tired after her long
voyage, and she preferred the quiet of Greyhope; she was fond of riding and country-life; but
still she would come to town for a time."  And so on.

"Ah, dear me, how charming!  And doesn't she resent her husband's absence--during the honeymoon?
or did the honeymoon occur before she came over to England?"  And Lady Balwood tried to say
it all playfully, and certainly said it something loudly.  She had daughters.

But Marion was perfectly prepared.  Her face did not change expression. "Yes, they had had
their honeymoon on the prairies; Frank was so fascinated with the life and the people.  He
had not come home at once, because he was making she did not know how great a fortune over
there in investments, and so Mrs. Armour came on before him, and, of course, as soon as he
could get away from his business, he would follow his wife."

And though Marion smiled, her heart was very hot, and she could have slain Lady Balwood in
her tracks.  Lady Balwood then nodded a little patronisingly, and babbled that "she hoped so
much to see Mrs. Francis Armour.  She must be so very interesting, the papers said so much
about her."

Now, while this conversation was going on, some one stood not far behind Marion, who seemed
much interested in her and what she said.  But Marion did not see this person.  She was startled
presently, however, to hear a strong voice say softly over her shoulder: "What a charming woman
Lady Balwood is!  And so ingenuous!"

She was grateful, tremulous, proud.  Why had he--Captain Vidall--kept out of the way all these
weeks, just when she needed him most, just when he should have played the part of a man?  Then
she was feeling twinges at the heart, too.  She had seen Lady Agnes Martling that afternoon,
and had noticed how the news had worn on her.  She felt how much better it had been had Frank
come quietly home and married her, instead of doing the wild, scandalous thing that was making
so many heart-burnings.  A few minutes ago she had longed for a chance to say something delicately
acid to Lady Haldwell, once Julia Sherwood, who was there.  Now there was a chance to give
her bitter spirit tongue.  She was glad--she dared not think how glad--to hear that voice again;
but she was angry too, and he should suffer for it--the more so because she recognised in the
tone, and afterwards in his face, that he was still absorbingly interested in her. We have finished

  Vidall did not take pains to
impress her with the fact that the matter occurred when he was almost a boy; and it was when
her earnest inquisition had drawn from him, bit by bit, the circumstances of the case, and
she had forgotten many parts of her commination service and to preserve an effective neutrality
in tone, that she became aware he was speaking ancient history.  Then it was too late to draw back.

They had threaded their way through the crowd into the conservatory, where they were quite
alone, and there, with only a little pyramid of hydrangeas between them, which she could not
help but notice chimed well with the colour of her dress, he dropped his voice a little lower,
and then suddenly said, his eyes hard on her: "I want your permission to go to Greyhope."

The tone drew her eyes hastily to his, and, seeing, she dropped them again.  Vidall had a strong
will, and, what is of more consequence, a peculiarly attractive voice.  It had a vibration
which made some of his words organ-like in sound.  She felt the influence of it.  She said
a little faintly, her fingers toying with a hydrangea: "I am afraid I do not understand.  There
is no reason why you should not go to Greyhope without my permission."

"I cannot go without it," he persisted.  "I am waiting for my commission from you."

She dropped her hand from the flower with a little impatient motion.  She was tired, her head
ached, she wanted to be alone.  "Why are you enigmatical?" she said.  Then quickly: "I wish
I knew what is in your mind.  You play with words so."

She scarcely knew what she said.  A woman who loves a man very much is not quick to take in
the absolute declaration of that man's love on the instant; it is too wonderful for her.  He
felt his check flush with hers, he drew her look again to his.  "Marion!  Marion!" he said.
That was all.

"Oh, hush, some one is coming!" was her quick, throbbing reply.  When they parted a half-hour
later, he said to her: "Will you give me my commission to go to Greyhope?"

"Oh no, I cannot," she said very gravely; "but come to Greyhope-when I go back."

"And when will that be?" he said, smiling, yet a little ruefully too.

"Please ask Mrs. Townley," she replied; "she is coming also."

Marion, knew what that commission to go to Greyhope meant.  But she determined that he should
see Lali first, before anything irrevocable was done.  She still looked upon Frank's marriage
as a scandal.  Well, Captain Vidall should face it in all its crudeness.  So, in a week or
less, Marion and Mrs. Townley were in Greyhope.

Two months had gone since Lali arrived in England, and yet no letter had come to her, or to
any of them, from Frank.  Frank's solicitor in London had written him fully of her arrival,
and he had had a reply, with further instructions regarding money to be placed to General Armour's
credit for the benefit of his wife.  Lali, as she became Europeanised, also awoke to the forms
and ceremonies of her new life.  She had overheard Frank's father and mother wondering, and
fretting as they wondered, why they had not received any word from him.  General Armour had
even called him a scoundrel, which sent Frank's mother into tears. Then Lali had questioned
Mackenzie and Colvin, for she had increasing shrewdness, and she began to feel her actual position.
She resented General Armour's imputation, but in her heart she began to pine and wonder.  At
times, too, she was fitful, and was not to be drawn out.  But she went on improving in personal
appearance and manner and in learning the English language.  Mrs. Townley's appearance marked
a change in her. When they met she suddenly stood still and trembled.  When Mrs. Townley came
to her and took her hand and kissed her, she shivered, and then caught her about the shoulders
lightly, but was silent.  After a little she said: "Come--come to my wigwam, and talk with me."

She said it with a strange little smile, for now she recognised that the word wigwam was not
to be used in her new life.  But Mrs. Townley whispered: "Ask Marion to come too."

Lali hesitated, and then said, a little maliciously: "Marion, will you come to my wigwam?"

Marion ran to her, caught her about the waist, and replied gaily: "Yes, we will have a pow-wow--is
that right--is pow-wow right?"

The Indian girl shook her head with a pretty vagueness, and vanished with them.  General Armour
walked up and down the room briskly, then turned on his wife and said: "Wife, it was a brutal
thing: Frank doesn't deserve to be--the father of her child."

But Lali had moods--singular moods.  She indulged in one three days after the arrival of Marion
and Mrs. Townley.  She had learned to ride with the side-saddle, and wore her riding-dress
admirably.  Nowhere did she show to better advantage.  She had taken to riding now with General
Armour on the country roads.  On this day Captain Vidall was expected, he having written to
ask that he might come.  What trouble Lali had with one of the servants that morning was never
thoroughly explained, but certain it is, she came to have a crude notion of why Frank Armour
married her.  The servant was dismissed duly, but that was after the contre-temps.

It was late afternoon.  Everybody had been busy, because one or two other guests were expected
besides Captain Vidall.  Lali had kept to herself, sending word through Richard that she would
not "be English," as she vaguely put it, that day.  She had sent Mackenzie on some mission.
She sat on the floor of her room, as she used to sit on the ground in her father's lodge. 
Her head was bowed in her hands, and her arms rested on her knees.  Her body swayed to and
fro.  Presently all motion ceased. She became perfectly still.  She looked before her as if
studying something.

Her eyes immediately flashed.  She rose quickly to her feet, went to her wardrobe, and took
out her Indian costume and blanket, with which she could never be induced to part.  Almost
feverishly she took off the clothes she wore and hastily threw them from her.  Then she put
on the buckskin clothes in which she had journeyed to England, drew down her hair as she used
to wear it, fastened round her waist a long red sash which had been given her by a governor
of the Hudson's Bay Company when he had visited her father's country, threw her blanket round
her shoulders, and then eyed herself in the great mirror in the room.  What she saw evidently
did not please her perfectly, for she stretched out her hands and looked at them; she shook
her head at herself and put her hand to her cheeks and pinched them, they were not so brown
as they once were, then she thrust out her foot.  She drew it back quickly in disdain. Immediately
she caught the fashionable slippers from her feet and threw them among the discarded garments.
She looked at herself again.  Still she was not satisfied, but she threw up her arms, as with
a sense of pleasure and freedom, and laughed at herself.  She pushed out her moccasined foot,
tapped the floor with it, nodded towards it, and said a word or two in her own language.  She
heard some one in the next room, possibly Mackenzie.  She stepped to the door leading into
the hall, opened it, went out, travelled its length, ran down a back hallway, out into the
park, towards the stables, her blanket, as her hair, flying behind her.

She entered the stables, made for a horse that she had ridden much, put a bridle on him, led
him out before any one had seen her, and, catching him by the mane, suddenly threw herself
on him at a bound, and, giving him a tap with a short whip she had caught up in the stable,
headed him for the main avenue and the open road.  Then a stableman saw her and ran after,
but he might as well have tried to follow the wind.  He forthwith proceeded to saddle another
horse.  Boulter also saw her as she passed the house, and, running in, told Mrs. Armour and
the general.  They both ran to the window and saw dashing down the avenue--a picture out of
Fenimore Cooper; a saddleless horse with a rider whose fingers merely touched the bridle, riding
as on a journey of life and death.

"My God, it's Lali!  She's mad--she's mad!  She is striking that horse! It will bolt!  It will
kill her!" cried the general.

Then he rushed for a horse to follow her.  Mrs. Armour's hands clasped painfully.  For an instant
she had almost the same thought as had Marion on the first morning of Lali's coming; but that
passed, and left her gazing helplessly after the horse-woman.  The flying blanket had frightened
the blooded horse, and he made desperate efforts to fulfil the general's predictions.

Lali soon found that she had miscalculated.  She was not riding an Indian pony, but a crazed,
high-strung horse.  As they flew, she sitting superbly and tugging at the bridle, the party
coming from the railway station entered the great gate, accompanied by Richard and Marion.
In a moment they sighted this wild pair bearing down upon them with a terrible swiftness.

As Marion recognised Lali she turned pale and cried out, rising in her seat.  Instinctively
Captain Vidall knew who it was, though he could not guess the cause of the singular circumstance.
He saw that the horse had bolted, but also that the rider seemed entirely fearless.  "Why,
in Heaven's name," he said between his teeth, "doesn't she let go that blanket!"

At that moment Lali did let it go, and the horse dashed by them, making hard for the gate.
"Turn the horses round and follow her," said Vidall to the driver.  While this was doing, Marion
caught sight of her father riding hard down the avenue.  He passed them, and called to them
to hurry on after him.

Lali had not the slightest sense of fear, but she knew that the horse had gone mad.  When they
passed through the gate and swerved into the road, a less practised rider would have been thrown.
She sat like wax.  The pace was incredible for a mile, and though General Armour rode well,
he was far behind.

Suddenly a trap appeared in the road in front of them, and the driver, seeing the runaway,
set his horses at right angles to the road.  It served the purpose only to provide another
danger.  Not far from where the trap was drawn, and between it and the runaway, was a lane,
which ended at a farmyard in a cul-de-sac.  The horse swerved into it, not slacking its pace,
and in the fraction of a minute came to the farmyard.

But now the fever was in Lali's blood.  She did not care whether she lived or died.  A high
hedge formed the cul-de-sac.  When she saw the horse slacking she cut it savagely across the
head twice with a whip, and drove him at the green wall.  He was of too good make to refuse
it, stiff as it was. Did it has been uplifting to every community and the climate of this islam.
The important and prevailing questions that had to be meet and that have been determine upon
the last few menstruation have had a lissom during the body of our
citizenry.  She
felt its hoof striking in its death-struggles, and once her shoulder was struck.  Instinctively
she buried her face in the mud, and her arms covered her head.

And then she knew no more.

When she came to, she was in the carriage within the gates of Greyhope, and Marion was bending
over her.  She suddenly tried to lift herself, but could not.  Presently she saw another face--that
of General Armour.  It was stern, and yet his eyes were swimming as he looked at her.

"How!" she said to him--"How!" and fainted again.
