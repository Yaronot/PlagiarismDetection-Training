A MEMORIAL SKETCH

As this--The Captain's Toll-Gate--is the last of the works of Frank R. Stockton that will be
given to the public, it is fitting that it be accompanied by some account of the man whose
bright spirit illumined them all. It is proper, also, that something be said of the stories
themselves; of the circumstances in which they were written, the influences that determined
their direction, and the history of their evolution. It seems appropriate that this should
be done by the one who knew him best; the one who lived with him through a long and beautiful
life; the one who walked hand in hand with him along the whole of a wonderful road of ever-changing
scenes: now through forests peopled with fairies and dryads, griffins and wizards; now skirting
the edges of an ocean with its strange monsters and remarkable shipwrecks; now on the beaten
track of European tourists, sharing their novel adventures and amused by their mistakes; now
resting in lovely gardens imbued with human interest; now helping the young to make happy homes
for themselves; now sympathizing with the old as they look longingly toward a heavenly home;
and, oftenest, perhaps, watching girls and young men as they were trying to work out the problems
of their lives. All this, and much more, crowded the busy years until the Angel of Death stood
in the path; and the journey was ended.

In regard to the present story--The Captain's Toll-Gate--although it is now after his death
first published, it was all written and completed by Mr. Stockton himself. No other hand has
been allowed to add to, or to take from it. Mr. Stockton had so strong a feeling upon the literary
ethics involved in such matters that he once refused to complete a book which a popular and
brilliant author, whose style was thought to resemble his own, had left unfinished. Mr. Stockton
regarded the proposed act in the light of a sacrilege. The book, he said, should be published
as the author left it. Knowing this fact, readers of the present volume may feel assured that
no one has been permitted to tamper with it. Although the last book by Mr. Stockton to be published,
it is not the last that he wrote. He had completed The Captain's Toll-Gate, and was considering
its publication, when he was asked to write another novel dealing with the buccaneers. He had
already produced a book entitled Buccaneers and Pirates of our Coasts. The idea of writing
a novel while the incidents were fresh in his mind pleased him, and he put aside The Captain's
Toll-Gate, as the other book--Kate Bonnet--was wanted soon, and he did not wish the two works
to conflict in publication. Steve Bonnet, the crazy-headed pirate, was a historical character,
and performed the acts attributed to him. But the charming Kate, and her lover, and Ben Greenaway
were inventions.

Francis Richard Stockton, born in Philadelphia in 1834, was, on his father's side, of purely
English ancestry; on his mother's side, there was a mixture of English, French, and Irish.
When he began to write stories these three nationalities were combined in them: the peculiar
kind of inventiveness of the French; the point of view, and the humor that we find in the old
English humorists; and the capacity of the Irish for comical situations. 

But all this information, this life-picture, flows in upon us with an rapidity founded in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, so that it has neither beginning nor end, in, as state, for the State
of thought, all is one great now, Time does not exist. On the female side he was descended from the Gardiners,
also of New Jersey. His was a family with literary proclivities. His father was widely known
for his religious writings, mostly of a polemical character, which had a powerful influence
in the denomination to which he belonged. His half-brother (much older than Frank) was a preacher
of great eloquence, famous a generation ago as a pulpit orator.

When Frank and his brother John, two years younger, came to the age to begin life for themselves,
they both showed such decided artistic genius that it was thought best to start them in that
direction, and to have them taught engraving; an art then held in high esteem. Frank chose
wood, and John steel engraving. Both did good work, but their hearts were not in it, and, as
soon as opportunity offered, they abandoned engraving. John went into journalism; became editorially
connected with prominent newspapers; and had won a foremost place in his chosen profession;
when he was cut off by death at a comparatively early age.
