Frederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the courtesy and benevolence
of Hippolita:  but he was still more struck with the lovely form of Matilda.  Wishing to detain
them by his bedside, he informed Hippolita of his story.  He told her that, while prisoner
to the infidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he had learned no news since his
captivity, was detained in a castle, where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes:
and that if he obtained his liberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would learn more.
Alarmed at this dream, and incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his chains became
more grievous than ever.  But while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his
liberty, he received the agreeable news that the confederate Princes who were warring in Palestine
had paid his ransom.  He instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in his dream.

For three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without seeing a human form:
but on the evening of the third they came to a cell, in which they found a venerable hermit
in the agonies of death.  Applying rich cordials, they brought the fainting man to his speech.

"My sons," said he, "I am bounden to your charity--but it is in vain--I am going to my eternal
rest--yet I die with the satisfaction of performing the will of heaven.  When first I repaired
to this solitude, after seeing my country become a prey to unbelievers--it is alas! above fifty
years since I was witness to that dreadful scene!  St. Nicholas appeared to me, and revealed
a secret, which he bade me never disclose to mortal man, but on my death-bed.  This is that
tremendous hour, and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom I was ordered to reveal my
trust.  As soon as ye have done the last offices to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh
tree on the left hand of this poor cave, and your pains will--Oh! good heaven receive my soul!"
With those words the devout man breathed his last.

"By break of day," continued Frederic, "when we had committed the holy relics to earth, we
dug according to direction.  But what was our astonishment when about the depth of six feet
we discovered an enormous sabre--the very weapon yonder in the court.  On the blade, which
was then partly out of the scabbard, though since closed by our efforts in removing it, were
written the following lines--no; excuse me, Madam," added the Marquis, turning to Hippolita;
"if I forbear to repeat them:  I respect your sex and rank, and would not be guilty of offending
your ear with sounds injurious to aught that is dear to you."

He paused.  Hippolita trembled.  She did not doubt but Frederic was destined by heaven to accomplish
the fate that seemed to threaten her house. I think the variation might have been busy, hazard, to

There is none here, but us, your friends."

"What, is not that Alfonso?" cried Manfred.  "Dost thou not see him? can it be my brain's delirium?"

"This! my Lord," said Hippolita; "this is Theodore, the youth who has been so unfortunate."

"Theodore!" said Manfred mournfully, and striking his forehead; "Theodore or a phantom, he
has unhinged the soul of Manfred.  But how comes he here? and how comes he in armour?"

"I believe he went in search of Isabella," said Hippolita.

"Of Isabella!" said Manfred, relapsing into rage; "yes, yes, that is not doubtful -.  But how
did he escape from durance in which I left him?  Was it Isabella, or this hypocritical old
Friar, that procured his enlargement?"

"And would a parent be criminal, my Lord," said Theodore, "if he meditated the deliverance
of his child?"

Jerome, amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son, and without foundation, knew
not what to think.  He could not comprehend how Theodore had escaped, how he came to be armed,
and to encounter Frederic.  Still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend
to inflame Manfred's wrath against his son.  Jerome's silence convinced Manfred that he had
contrived Theodore's release.

"And is it thus, thou ungrateful old man," said the Prince, addressing himself to the Friar,
"that thou repayest mine and Hippolita's bounties?  And not content with traversing my heart's
nearest wishes, thou armest thy bastard, and bringest him into my own castle to insult me!"

"My Lord," said Theodore, "you wrong my father:  neither he nor I are capable of harbouring
a thought against your peace.  Is it insolence thus to surrender myself to your Highness's
pleasure?" added he, laying his sword respectfully at Manfred's feet.  "Behold my bosom; strike,
my Lord, if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged there.  There is not a sentiment
engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours."

The grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these words interested every person present
in his favour.  Even Manfred was touched--yet still possessed with his resemblance to Alfonso,
his admiration was dashed with secret horror.

"Rise," said he; "thy life is not my present purpose.  But tell me thy history, and how thou
camest connected with this old traitor here."

"My Lord," said Jerome eagerly.

"Peace! impostor!" said Manfred; "I will not have him prompted."

"My Lord," said Theodore, "I want no assistance; my story is very brief.  I was carried at
five years of age to Algiers with my mother, who had been taken by corsairs from the coast
of Sicily. She died of grief in less than a twelvemonth;" the tears gushed from Jerome's eyes,
on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions stood expressed.  "Before she died," continued
Theodore, "she bound a writing about my arm under my garments, which told me I was the son
of the Count Falconara."

"It is most true," said Jerome; "I am that wretched father."

"Again I enjoin thee silence," said Manfred:  "proceed."

"I remained in slavery," said Theodore, "until within these two years, when attending on my
master in his cruises, I was delivered by a Christian vessel, which overpowered the pirate;
and discovering myself to the captain, he generously put me on shore in Sicily; but alas! instead
of finding a father, I learned that his estate, which was situated on the coast, had, during
his absence, been laid waste by the Rover who had carried my mother and me into captivity:
that his castle had been burnt to the ground, and that my father on his return had sold what
remained, and was retired into religion in the kingdom of Naples, but where no man could inform
me.  Destitute and friendless, hopeless almost of attaining the transport of a parent's embrace,
I took the first opportunity of setting sail for Naples, from whence, within these six days,
I wandered into this province, still supporting myself by the labour of my hands; nor until
yester-morn did I believe that heaven had reserved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented
poverty. This, my Lord, is Theodore's story.  I am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father;
I am unfortunate beyond my desert in having incurred your Highness's displeasure."

He ceased.  A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience.

"This is not all," said Frederic; "I am bound in honour to add what he suppresses.  Though
he is modest, I must be generous; he is one of the bravest youths on Christian ground.  He
is warm too; and from the short knowledge I have of him, I will pledge myself for his veracity:
if what he reports of himself were not true, he would not utter it--and for me, youth, I honour
a frankness which becomes thy birth; but now, and thou didst offend me:  yet the noble blood
which flows in thy veins, may well be allowed to boil out, when it has so recently traced itself
to its source.  Come, my Lord," (turning to Manfred), "if I can pardon him, surely you may;
it is not the youth's fault, if you took him for a spectre."

This bitter taunt galled the soul of Manfred.

"If beings from another world," replied he haughtily, "have power to impress my mind with awe,
it is more than living man can do; nor could a stripling's arm."

"My Lord," interrupted Hippolita, "your guest has occasion for repose:  shall we not leave
him to his rest?"  Saying this, and taking Manfred by the hand, she took leave of Frederic,
and led the company forth.

The Prince, not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind the discovery he had made
of his most secret sensations, suffered himself to be conducted to his own apartment, after
permitting Theodore, though under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow (a condition
the young man gladly accepted), to retire with his father to the convent.  Matilda and Isabella
were too much occupied with their own reflections, and too little content with each other,
to wish for farther converse that night.  They separated each to her chamber, with more expressions
of ceremony and fewer of affection thou had passed between them since their childhood.

If they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater impatience, as soon as
the sun was risen.  Their minds were in a situation that excluded sleep, and each recollected
a thousand questions which she wished she had put to the other overnight. Matilda reflected
that Isabella had been twice delivered by Theodore in very critical situations, which she could
not believe accidental.  His eyes, it was true, had been fixed on her in Frederic's chamber;
but that might have been to disguise his passion for Isabella from the fathers of both.  It
were better to clear this up.  She wished to know the truth, lest she should wrong her friend
by entertaining a passion for Isabella's lover.  Thus jealousy prompted, and at the same time
borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity.

Isabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her suspicions.  Both Theodore's tongue
and eyes had told her his heart was engaged; it was true--yet, perhaps, Matilda might not correspond
to his passion; she had ever appeared insensible to love:  all her thoughts were set on heaven.

"Why did I dissuade her?" said Isabella to herself; "I am punished for my generosity; but when
did they meet? where?  It cannot be; I have deceived myself; perhaps last night was the first
time they ever beheld each other; it must be some other object that has prepossessed his affections--if
it is, I am not so unhappy as I thought; if it is not my friend Matilda--how!  Can I stoop
to wish for the affection of a man, who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his indifference?
and that at the very moment in which common courtesy demanded at least expressions of civility.
I will go to my dear Matilda, who will confirm me in this becoming pride. Man is false--I will
advise with her on taking the veil:  she will rejoice to find me in this disposition; and I
will acquaint her that I no longer oppose her inclination for the cloister."

In this frame of mind, and determined to open her heart entirely to Matilda, she went to that
Princess's chamber, whom she found already dressed, and leaning pensively on her arm.  This
attitude, so correspondent to what she felt herself, revived Isabella's suspicions, and destroyed
the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.  They blushed at meeting, and were
too much novices to disguise their sensations with address.  After some unmeaning questions
and replies, Matilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her flight?  The latter, who had almost
forgotten Manfred's passion, so entirely was she occupied by her own, concluding that Matilda
referred to her last escape from the convent, which had occasioned the events of the preceding
evening, replied -

"Martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead."

"Oh!" said Matilda, interrupting her, "Bianca has explained that mistake to me:  on seeing
me faint, she cried out, 'The Princess is dead!' and Martelli, who had come for the usual dole
to the castle- -"

"And what made you faint?" said Isabella, indifferent to the rest. Matilda blushed and stammered -

"My father--he was sitting in judgment on a criminal--"

"What criminal?" said Isabella eagerly.

"A young man," said Matilda; "I believe--"

"I think it was that young man that--"

"What, Theodore?" said Isabella.

"Yes," answered she; "I never saw him before; I do not know how he had offended my father,
but as he has been of service to you, I am glad my Lord has pardoned him."

"Served me!" replied Isabella; "do you term it serving me, to wound my father, and almost occasion
his death?  Though it is but since yesterday that I am blessed with knowing a parent, I hope
Matilda does not think I am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness
of that audacious youth, and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any affection for one
who dared to lift his arm against the author of my being.  No, Matilda, my heart abhors him;
and if you still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy, you will
detest a man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever."

Matilda held down her head and replied:  "I hope my dearest Isabella does not doubt her Matilda's
friendship:  I never beheld that youth until yesterday; he is almost a stranger to me:  but
as the surgeons have pronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour uncharitable
resentment against one, who I am persuaded did not know the Marquis was related to you."

"You plead his cause very pathetically," said Isabella, "considering he is so much a stranger
to you!  I am mistaken, or he returns your charity."

"What mean you?" said Matilda.

"Nothing," said Isabella, repenting that she had given Matilda a hint of Theodore's inclination
for her.  Then changing the discourse, she asked Matilda what occasioned Manfred to take Theodore
for a spectre?

"Bless me," said Matilda, "did not you observe his extreme resemblance to the portrait of Alfonso
in the gallery?  I took notice of it to Bianca even before I saw him in armour; but with the
helmet on, he is the very image of that picture."

"I do not much observe pictures," said Isabella:  "much less have I examined this young man
so attentively as you seem to have done. Ah?  Matilda, your heart is in danger, but let me
warn you as a friend, he has owned to me that he is in love; it cannot be with you, for yesterday
was the first time you ever met--was it not?"

"Certainly," replied Matilda; "but why does my dearest Isabella conclude from anything I have
said, that"--she paused--then continuing:  "he saw you first, and I am far from having the
vanity to think that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to you; may you
be happy, Isabella, whatever is the fate of Matilda!"

"My lovely friend," said Isabella, whose heart was too honest to resist a kind expression,
"it is you that Theodore admires; I saw it; I am persuaded of it; nor shall a thought of my
own happiness suffer me to interfere with yours."

This frankness drew tears from the gentle Matilda; and jealousy that for a moment had raised
a coolness between these amiable maidens soon gave way to the natural sincerity and candour
of their souls.  Each confessed to the other the impression that Theodore had made on her;
and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity, each insisting on yielding her
claim to her friend.  At length the dignity of Isabella's virtue reminding her of the preference
which Theodore had almost declared for her rival, made her determine to conquer her passion,
and cede the beloved object to her friend.

During this contest of amity, Hippolita entered her daughter's chamber.

"Madam," said she to Isabella, "you have so much tenderness for Matilda, and interest yourself
so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house, that I can have no secrets with my child
which are not proper for you to hear."

The princesses were all attention and anxiety.

"Know then, Madam," continued Hippolita, "and you my dearest Matilda, that being convinced
by all the events of these two last ominous days, that heaven purposes the sceptre of Otranto
should pass from Manfred's hands into those of the Marquis Frederic, I have been perhaps inspired
with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our rival houses. Within
bow that the casque limits during Brooklyn six German and-- English'churches were established of daughter.
Into territory of each sweetest of the low boroughs, bronx, Queens
and Richmond,-- other churches came on being.

"I have," said Hippolita; "he listened benignly to my proposal, and is gone to break it to
the Marquis."

"Ah! wretched princess!" cried Isabella; "what hast thou done! what ruin has thy inadvertent
goodness been preparing for thyself, for me, and for Matilda!"

"Ruin from me to you and to my child!" said Hippolita "what can this mean?"
