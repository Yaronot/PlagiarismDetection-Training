INTRODUCTION

BY

THE REV. JOHN MACPHERSON,

Author of "The Life of Duncan Mathieson."

From East London to West Canada is a change pleasing to imagine. From dusky lane and fetid
alley to open, bright Canadian fields is, in the very thought, refreshing. A child is snatched
from pinching hunger, fluttering rags, and all the squalor of gutter life; from a creeping
existence in the noisome pool of slum society is lifted up into some taste for decency and
cleanliness; from being trained in the school whose first and last lesson is to fear neither
God nor man, is taught the beginnings of Christian faith and duty, and by a strong effort of
love and patience is borne away to the free, spacious regions of the western hemisphere, of
which it may be said, as of the King's feast, "yet there is room," and where even a hapless
waif may get a chance and a choice both for this world and the world that is to come. This
is a picture on which a kind heart loves to rest. But who shall make the picture real?

Go and first catch your little Arab, if you can. I say, if you can; for he is too old to be
caught by chaff, and you shall need as much guile as any fowler ever did. Then with patient
hands bestow on his body its first baptism of clean water, a task often unspeakably shocking;
reduce to fit size and shape a cast-off suit humbly begged for the occasion, and give him his
first experience of decent clothing. Thereafter, proceed to the work, sometimes the most trying
ever undertaken, of taming this singularly acute, desperately sly, and often ferociously savage
little Englishman, training him to be what he is not, or harder task still, to be not what
he is. Having, by dint of much pains and many prayers, obtained, as you hope, some beginnings
of victory over the most wayward of wills, and the most unaccountably strange of mixed natures,
with its intellectual sharpness and moral bluntness, its precocious knowingness and stereotyped
childishness, its quickness to learn and slowness to unlearn, prepare for the next stage of
your enterprise. Lay out your scheme of emigration, get the money where you can, that is to
say, call it flown from heaven and wile it out of earthly pockets, anticipate all possible
emergencies and wants by land and sea, finish for the time the much epistolary correspondence
to which this same fragment of humanity has given rise, tempt the deep with your restless charge,
bear the discomforts of the stormiest of seas, and inwardly groan at the signs of other and
worse tempests ready ever to burst forth in the Atlantic of that young sinner's future course;
and when after many weeks of anxious thought, fatiguing travel, and laborious inquiry you find
a home for the child, fold your hands, give thanks and say, "What an adventure! What a toil!
But now at length it is finished!" And yet perhaps it is not half finished.

Multiply all this thought and feeling, all this labour and prayer a thousandfold; and imagine
the work of a woman as tenderly attached to home and its peaceful ways as any one of her sisters
in the three kingdoms, who has made some twenty-eight voyages across the Atlantic "all for
love and nothing for reward;" has, by miracles of prayerful toil and self-denying kindness,
rescued from a worse than Egyptian bondage over three thousand waifs and strays, borne them
in her strong arms to the other side of the world, and planted them in a good land; meanwhile,
in the intervals of travel, facing the perils and storms of the troubled sea of East London
society at its very worst, and from a myriad wrecks of manhood and womanhood, snatching the
stragglers not yet past all hope, and, in a holy enthusiasm of love, parting with not a little
of her own life in order that those dead might live.

The outer part of the story alone can be told: the inner part only God and the patient toiler
on this field can know. Yet the inner work is by far the greater. The thought, the cares, the
fears, the prayers, the tears, the anguish, the heart-breaking disappointments, and the fiery
ordeals of spirit by which alone the motive is kept pure and the flame of a true zeal is fed,--in
short, all the lavish expenditure of soul that cannot be spoken, or written, or known, until
the Omniscient Recorder, who forgets nothing and repays even the good purpose of the heart,
will reveal it at the final award, is by far the most important service as it is ever the most
toilsome and painful.

In the work of the kingdom of God on earth the true worker is in point of importance first.
Apart from the wise, holy, beneficent soul, even the truth of the Gospel is but a dead letter.
It is in the intelligence, loveliness, magnanimity and sweetness of a human spirit, touched
finely by His own grace, that the Holy Ghost finds His chief instrumentality. Preparation for
a good work is usually begun in early life, and the worker, whose story is to fill the following
pages, unconsciously learnt her first lessons for this service in her father's house. There
was, indeed, seemingly little to be learned of any rare sort in the quiet village of Campsie,
where life passed as peacefully as the clouds sailing along the peaceful heavens. Almost the
only break in the even tenor of those days was an occasional sojourn in the house of her uncle,
the Rev. Dr. Edwards, a minister of the United Presbyterian Church in Glasgow, where that venerable
soldier of the cross still lingers, as if halfway betwixt the Church militant and the Church
triumphant But whether in the father's house or in the uncle's manse, kind and truthful speech
was the coin current, a good example the domestic stock-in-trade, and an interchange of cheerful,
loving service the main business. It was a quiet school, whose very hum was peaceful; and yet
the schooling was thorough; things strong often grow as quietly as things feeble. The oak rises
as silently in the forest as the lily in the garden. Strong characters, too, under any conditions
of life, school themselves much more than they are schooled. Active, inquisitive, resolute,
and possessing a fair share of the national perfervidum ingenium, not without some tincture
of those elements of the Scottish character known as the "canny" and the "dour," our worker
early developed that robust vigour of mind and body which has so long stood the wear and tear
of severely trying work.

One passage of significance in the family history deserves notice, especially as suggesting
a peculiar feature in her early training and supplying a link in the chain of providential
events. In work among the young her father was an enthusiast. With a heart bigger than her
own family circle, her mother took in two orphans to foster and rear. Thus in the work of caring
for the outcast and the forlorn Annie Macpherson was "to the manner born." Inheriting her father's
enthusiasm and her mother's sympathetic nature, the quick-witted, warm-hearted girl would not
fail to note the equal footing enjoyed by the stranger children, and would know the reason
why: the much tact employed to keep the new and difficult relations sweet would engage her
attention; and the exceeding tenderness with which the motherless little ones were treated,
would be a very practical Gospel to our young scholar in Christian philanthropy. Were matters
sometimes strained? did little jars arise and a shadow now and then gather on the faces of
the strangers because their own mother was not? The wise foster-mother would set all right
again by some merry quip, some gleesome turn, some one of those playful gleams of humour which
furnish a key to the secret of successful work among the young. To be a mother to those orphans,
to make life in its duties and joys, as far as possible, the same to them as if they had not
lost their own mother, ay, and to teach them to gather the brightest roses from the thorniest
bushes, was at once a good work in itself, and a model for one who was destined to similar
service, only on an immensely wider scale and on a tenfold more difficult field. The sisterly
fostering of the orphans was a providential training for her future life-work. To learn to
love and to serve over and above the claims of mere natural affection, could not fail to enlarge
the heart and awaken the sympathies of a quick, susceptible child. Little did her mother know
what she was doing when she took the orphans to her bosom. She only thought to make a warm
home and a bright future for the hapless pair; but in effect she was preparing a warm home
and a bright future for thousands of the poorest children on God's earth.

But there was something better in store. Girlish days swept by much as usual--the rapid growth
of warm thought and feeling making each revolving year a continuous springtide, an opening
summer. At nineteen, Annie Macpherson looked out on a world that always promises more to youthful
eyes than it ever fulfils. Eager hope was drawing much on a future whose furthest horizon was
Time. Suddenly a shadow fell. A word spoken by a friend was the vehicle of a divine message.
A more distant and awful horizon arose to view: Time with its hopes and joys, like a thin mist
in early morning, vanished in the light of eternity; and quickly from that young heart, pierced
with a new sorrow, went up the prayer, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"

How little the world understands that same old prayer. Yonder afar off stands a man who, having
trafficked in all iniquity, having matured in wickedness, and perfected himself in the fine
art of dodging truth and conscience, is at length found out in the thicket of his own vices
by a bull's eye that glares on him like hell. Well it befits such an one, even the world admits,
to smite upon his breast and cry for mercy. But for a girl in her teens, an innocent, merry-hearted,
pure-minded young thing, to raise a cry for mercy like a very publican or a prodigal, is confounding
to the world's sense of propriety and measure in things; and hence that world is angry, and
in effect repudiates the need of so much mercy, of so much abasement and urgency in a case
like this. The root and rise of this cry for mercy the natural man does not understand; but
that soul knows it right well, where the lightnings of Omniscient Holiness have gleamed and
the shadows of God's anger have fallen.

The cry was heard. Light arose on that troubled soul, the Saviour appeared and drew the sinking
one out of the waters. Even where there is little to be changed outwardly, conversion is always
followed by remarkable effects; the light of the morning is like a new creation on the cultivated
field as well as on the barren moor. Our young convert saw everything in a new light. She understood
now, as she had not before, why her mother, stealing precious hours from sleep, wearied her
fingers and weakened her eyes with the self-imposed task of providing for the necessities of
children not her own. If a ruling motive is one of the greatest things in the secret of a human
life, the grandest of all forces on earth is the love of Christ. This she felt, and it was
to her a divine revelation. From the feeble starlight of natural sympathies she had passed
into the clear day of Christian affections, and she now knew the secret joy and power of self-sacrifice.
A hundred lessons and practical illustrations given her by both her parents were suddenly lighted
up with a new meaning, and clothed with a beauty she had not heretofore seen, and a power she
had not hitherto felt. All she had learned before of truth, and prudence, and kindness, she
learned over again, and learned with the quickness characteristic of the young convert. Very
soon her whole treasury of knowledge and feeling, of experience and character, was laid with
youthful jubilance on the altar of the Lord. From that hour she began to work for Christ with
an intensity of enthusiasm that ever since has known no abatement.

GOD'S ANSWERS.

The winter of 1860-61 is a time to be had much in remembrance before the Lord. It was then
that the East of London, with all its sins and sorrows, was laid as a heavy, burden on the
heart of His faithful and beloved servant Reginald Radcliffe.

Before the commencement of his labours, a few Christian friends met for prayer at the invitation
of the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel. The East of London, and its "stunning-tide of human care
and crime," was not the only thought of that revered man of God. His faith looked forward to
greater things, and one well-remembered petition was, that blessing through the work then to
be begun in that deeply degraded and neglected region, might not be stayed there, but might
flow from thence to far-off lands. One then present, the Dowager Lady Rowley, was not long
permitted to sow precious seed with her own hand, but was instrumental in the fulfilment of
this petition, as it was through her leading that Miss Macpherson's voice was first heard in
the East of London.

At that time Miss Macpherson was residing in the neighbourhood of Cambridge with her sister
and brother-in-law, Mr. Merry, and, was already a worker in the Lord's vineyard.

She thus writes of the year 1861:--

"It was a turning point in my life. I made a pilgrimage to London to attend the preaching of
Reginald Radcliffe in the City of London Theatre, Shoreditch. There I met Dr. Elwin. On the
following evening, at the Young Men's Christian Association, Great Marlborough Street, he introduced
me to Lady Rowley, Mr. Morgan, and many other Christian friends. Through them I was led to
attend the next Barnet Conference, where I learned what it was to wait for the coming of the Lord."

With this bright and blessed hope she returned to work with a strength and power before unknown.
Many souls had already been awakened, but the full tide of blessing had not yet come. In the
villages around her hundreds of labourers were employed in digging for coprolites, a fossil
which, when ground, is useful as manure. Among these men were many of the wildest wanderers,
and Miss Macpherson's heart was deeply stirred for their spiritual welfare, and her time and
strength were given to reach them by every means in her power. She had established evening
schools, lending libraries and coffee-sheds, and of these and further efforts she wrote:--

"Second to the preaching of the gospel, we lay every laudable snare to induce men to learn
to read and write. In doing this, spare time is occupied to the best account, and the enemy
is foiled in some of his thousand-and-one ways of ensnaring the toil-worn navvy at the close
of day.

"The more our little band goes forward, the more we feel that drink, in all its forms and foolish
customs, must be resisted,--first, by the powerful influence of a felt example; and secondly,
by gently and kindly instructing the minds of those amongst whom we labour as to its hurtful
snares. We are accused by some of putting this subject before the blessed gospel. God forbid!
But when we look on every reclaimed one and know that this was his besetting sin, we regard
the giving it up as the rolling away of the stone before the Saviour's voice, 'Come forth,'
can be obeyed.

"These first endeavours to spread the gospel story in a more enlarged way were made in villages
where the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon had laboured when not yet twenty years of age, and where souls
had been blessed through the youthful preacher. Some of these converts became my helpers, and
are co-workers to this day.

"It was in 1863 that I first became an almoner for others, whilst filled with a desire to build
a missionhall among the coprolite diggers in Cambridgeshire.

"The friends attending the Barnet Conference heard of my wish and shared my burden."

The following letter to Dr. Elwin shows the sympathy that he felt in her work:--

"My DEAR FRIEND,--Thanking you for your daily remembrance of my continual wants in this the
Lord's work among these poor migratory coprolite diggers, I must say it was indeed refreshing
to think that this little hidden vineyard was laid on your heart to present to the Lord at
the Bristol Conference. The answer has come, and now it is my blessed privilege to ask you
to rejoice and praise our loving Father for another six souls born anew. Yes, dear brother,
they are those I have laid before you again and again to plead for, that the dead form of godliness
might be broken down. Though diggers, they are residents in a neighbouring village, and have
attended my ploughmen's Bible-class for some years. From the mouths of many witnesses, in a
series of outdoor gatherings every Lord's day evening in the past summer, they have heard,
on their own village green, a present, free, and full salvation.

"Is it not kind of the Master to employ us feeble women in His service, by allowing us to use
our quiet influence for Him, and to do many little things, such as inviting wanderers to listen,
providing hymns and seats, also refreshment for those sent to deliver the King's message? And
oh! it is indeed a hallowed privilege to be a 'Hur,' to hold up the hands of the speaker, and
watch the index of the soul as the message of love or of warning falls; to slip in and out
of the group, and meet the trembling soul with a blessed promise, or grasp the hand with Christian
sympathy. Then for us women such service affords opportunity of giving the little leaflet or
book, such as the case requires, and following it up in the home with Bible in hand.

"The Lord was very good in sending me helpers, i.e., brothers, to speak during all those summer
Lord's-Day evenings. On one occasion I was left alone, and yet not alone. At another time my
faith was tried. No one had come to speak. The people had gathered. I opened my Testament on
the passage, 'Come and see' (John iv.) If the Samaritan woman was led so boldly to say to wicked
men, 'Come and see,' surely my Lord knew my burden, and my need for a brother to speak to that
village gathering. We sang a hymn. I was led to pray. On arising from the grass, a young man
came round the corner and said, 'Miss, the Lord has laid it on my heart to come here and preach
to-night. Can I be of any service?' He took for his text, 'Yet there is room.'

"I know you like to trace the links in the chain of blessing, so I will enter a little into
detail. One village displayed the most perfect outward form of all that is considered correct
as to the using of means. There were clubs, saving of money, young men well dressed and regular
at their place of worship, four nights a week at their evening school; but oh! my friend, not
one soul of them with a warm heart towards the Lord Jesus Christ. They read and answered my
questions on Scripture better, and sought after the library books with more interest, than
any in the other villages; but it was all head-work, no heart; all intellect, no love. On Christmas
Day six of these joined our coprolite party to tea, and from eight to ten solemn prayer seemed
laid on every heart for them; and again the following evening nineteen young men met to pray
still for this village. Last evening eighteen Christians of various denominations met in a
cottage at this said village. There was no formal address, but after earnest prayer, one of
the brethren felt this passage laid solemnly on his heart, 'To-day, if ye will hear His voice,
harden not your hearts.' Then some converted stone-diggers pleaded for a blessing. The answer
of four years' prayers came, and the feeble infant wail was heard from one after another amid
weeping and sobbing. Surely the angelic host had songs of praise while, in that holy stillness,
these young men had a sight of themselves. Oh, pray on that our faith waver not, for we believe
we shall see still greater things.

"You remember the village where you preached upon 'Jesus passing by.' There is now a band of
more than a dozen praying young men meeting constantly in their little outhouse.

"The more we go forward in this labour of love the more evident it is that the cursed drink
is our great difficulty. This stone must be rolled away. Another evening home for these men
is a stern necessity, and must be provided; a place which they may call their own. Each building
would cost 30 pounds. The men would furnish it cheerfully and support it nobly. Two such buildings
have been erected, are now in operation, and answer beyond my most sanguine expectations. Morning,
noon, and evening, groups of men, while at their hasty meals, are willing to listen to the
Holy Scriptures or whatever else may be brought before them."

"The memory of the just is blessed." It is sweet to recall any incident in the life of him
who will ever live in the hearts of many. Miss Macpherson thus records the day of blessing:--

"It was at a meeting in July 1864, at Mildmay Park, that it was laid on my heart to gather
together, before the harvest-time, the stone-diggers, villagers, and their friends, and to
invite the Rev. W. and Mrs. Pennefather to see face to face the hundreds of souls for whom
they had wrestled with God. Early in the afternoon of the day appointed, streams of poor men
and women came, having walked distances of from two to ten miles to be with us. = of the ratables, Vitrioll,

 Here may be seen something of the Lord's purpose
in having permitted Miss Macpherson's voyage to New York. In that city she had seen the faith
and courage the Lord had given to women to "attempt great things" for Him, and the day is well
remembered when many prayers were answered that she would accept the post. It is a post far
advanced into the enemy's territory, for the adjoining streets are known as the "Thieves' Quarter."
Three thousand, it is supposed, have their headquarters here. In the square mile in the midst
of which the Refuge, (now called "Home of Industry"), is situated, 120,000 of our poorest population
are to be found. From the first Mr. and Mrs. Merry gave themselves as willing and invaluable
helpers to the enormous work connected with the undertaking. It appeared great from the beginning,
but little could any one have imagined how it would go on spreading and increasing. It is difficult,
or it may be impossible, to name any form of distress or any class which has not been here
relieved and blessed. Every hour of the day, and even far on into the night, the voice of praise
and prayer has been heard in some part of the building. Even in the vaults beneath the pavement
was a little sanctuary made. Under the very stones, before trodden by them as homeless wanderers,
some have joined in asking the Lord's blessing on those who had rescued them.

In February, 1869, the Lord granted us the desire of our hearts, and the Home of Industry was
opened with praise and prayer. "The Lord had done great things for us," but far more than any
heart then, conceived were the blessings yet in store.

On February 22, Miss Macpherson wrote as follows in the "Christian":--

"BELOVED HELPERS,--To-night how your hearts would have rejoiced to have seen me and my happy
hundreds of little toiling children in our new schoolroom in the Refuge. How varied their feelings!
One whispered, 'It was here my mother died of the cholera.' Another, 'Oh! I was once in this
ward before, so ill of black cholera.' Dear children! our prayer was that it might still be
a house of mercy to many a sin-wearied soul. We have never had such a large schoolroom before,
nor the advantage of desks. Their joy knew no bounds when told to invite their mothers to come
one afternoon in the week to help me to sew and to earn sixpence, my object being twofold,--to
secure an opportunity of telling them the gospel, and to endeavour to help them in the management
of their homes and little ones."

The following will show something of the trials attending "holding the fort" in such a spot:--

"Last night I felt it right to sleep at the Refuge for once, so as to be able to enter into
all its needs. No words can describe the sounds in the streets surrounding it throughout the
night;--yells of women, cries of 'Murder!' then of 'Police!'--with the rushing to and fro of
wild, drunken men and women into the street adjoining the building, whence more criminals come
than from any other street in London. At three o'clock the heavy rumble of market-waggons commenced,
and then the rush of the fire-brigade. Thus much by way of asking special prayer for those
whom God has made willing to live in the midst of such surroundings. On the other side of the
building is an empty space, known as 'Rag Fair,' filled in the morning with a horde of the
poorest women selling the veriest old rubbish. We are thankful to have among these a faithful
Christian woman, who, though a seller of rags, is able to testify of the great love of the
Lord Jesus."

Emigration had now for some time been in view as the only means of relieving the chronic poverty
of the East of London, and in April 1869 a circular to this effect was issued by Miss Macpherson
and Miss Ellen Logan. Fifty families were selected as being suitable for such help, and these
were gathered together at a farewell tea-meeting before leaving for Canada, all expressing
deep thankfulness for the opening given to them. The preparations for the voyage of these fathers,
mothers, and little ones required much thought and labour, both for their temporal and spiritual
welfare, but from the very beginning of the work, sisters in Christ came from a distance, giving
hours or days as a labour of love, and besides personal help on the spot, many busy fingers
were at work in their own homes. The first party was followed by others, all involving much
care and labour. Before the close of the year very encouraging accounts were received from
many of the travellers, and the contrast was great between their condition in the new country
and that which might here have been their lot. Whilst this important work was being carried
on, evening reading and sewing classes for the little matchbox-makers, and mothers' meetings,
were continued without intermission, together with the teaching and training of boys begun
at the first Homes; and on the Lord's Day, besides the very large gathering of matchbox-makers,
every effort was made to bring all around under the sound of the gospel. A stranger thus describes
his impressions after a visit to the Home of Industry, November, 1869:--

"'The mighty cry of anguish' that has gone up for so long from the East of London has, thank
God, touched many a heart, and led some to carry God's answering messages in person to the
suffering poor, and others to help in the lesser service of gifts.

"Determined to see how the matter stood as regards one portion of that great mass of misery,
I gave myself up to the skilful guidance of one whose whole life is spent in the service of
God and His poor.

"Leaving the rail, we proceeded to visit the sick-bed of one of the voluntary workers in the
Refuge. We found him recovering from a severe attack of enteric fever complicated with pneumonia
of the right lung. A fine, handsome young man, once the leader of the singing in a philharmonic
club, now the devoted servant of God, his whole anxiety seemed to be as to when he could return
to his work. During our visit, it was most touching to see the tenderness and anxious care
of his companion, a young man called Fred, a labourer in the large wine vaults at the docks,
who, though smelling of wine, and his clothes saturated with the fumes of spirits, was a staunch
teetotaller; and judging from the intelligent way in which he answered our questions, would
be a valuable witness before any commission of inquiry into the practices which wine-sellers
term 'mixing,' but which he vulgarly called 'adulteration.' Every night during the many weeks
of illness Fred had paid his friend a visit, and watched over him with all the love of a Jonathan
to a David.

"We now pressed him into our service to conduct us through some of the many licensed lodging-houses
and thieves' kitchens, which abound in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields.

"On our way we met two little girls, matchbox-makers. The outline of their lives was given
in a few moments. The father, a drunkard, had absconded six years ago, leaving his wife and
six children to struggle with awful poverty as best they might, having previously so beaten
and kicked his wife about the face, that she had become almost blind. 'Where's father now?'
'In the workhouse, stoneblind.'

"In a room with a roaring fire were seated some thirty men and a few women with infants. The
landlord's reception was anything but gracious. In answer to our 'Good evening,' he growled
out, 'We don't want talk; those men want bread.' And hungry enough many seemed. So while one
was sent for a supply of bread, which was received with unmistakable gladness, and devoured
greedily, we spoke to them of that living bread which came down from heaven. All were interested,
and one young man seemed to wince and to be ill at ease when the love of God was spoken of.
I could not but feel that conscience was at work, perhaps memory carrying back his mind to
a godly mother, who once had spoken the same loving words, but had gone to her rest in tears.

"We then entered a licensed lodging-house accommodating 350. This was a sad sight, because
three-fourths of the men were unemployed poor, chiefly dock-labourers, willing and glad to
work, if work could be got. On many a face there were stamped hopelessness and apathy. Two
poor fellows were sipping a cup of tea, without milk or sugar, given to them by a poor man,
but they had not a morsel of bread; and this was their breakfast,--a late one truly, for it
was ten at night. Out all day in search of work, their last coppers were paid for the night's
lodging, and a cup of poor tea was their only meal. It made one's spirit groan to think of
the misery that sin and selfishness had wrought for these poor fellows.

"The next visit was to a poor dying girl; in a room so small that there was only a margin of
about three feet round two sides of the bed for standing ground, the floor covered with rags,
(her mother being a rag-mender), lay one, who, though poor and miserable, was yet an heir of
glory, and was upheld in all her wretchedness by Him who was sent to be 'the Comforter.' We
thanked God for these two bright spots, where divine light and love were seen and felt.

"At the Home of Industry we had been invited to take tea with two hundred and fifty destitute
widows. The testimony of one of these, a clean, tidy old woman, was very precious. She had
once been in affluent circumstances and drove her carriage; her fortune lost in one day, she
was now reduced to poverty, but, 'Sir,' she said, 'I would not go back to it all and be as
I then was; no, not for all the world.' Possessing Christ as her own, she felt she had the
riches of God, and knew that there was an inheritance reserved for her in heaven, incorruptible,
and undefiled, and that fadeth not away."

The great lifework of Miss Macpherson and her devoted family may be said to have begun this
year. The need of emigration may be expressed in her own words:--

"Boys came to us for shelter instead of going to empty barrels, railway arches, and stairways.
We found they were grateful for all that was done for them. The simple gospel lesson was our
lever to lift them into new thoughts and desires. The sharp dividing knife of the Word of God
would discover the thief and liar, and rouse the conscience to confession more than anything
beside. But our walls had limits, and our failures in finding employment for many away from
their old haunts became a great difficulty, and the God-opened way of emigration to Canada
was pressed upon us."

"Thy God hath commanded thy strength." To the astonishment of many, Miss Macpherson expressed
her determination to pioneer the first band, and He Who of old sent forth His disciples two
and two, was mindful of the present need, and so strengthened the heart of a young sister (already
deeply interested in the work, and singularly gifted in many ways) to lay all at the feet of
her Master, and to offer to share whatever toils and trials might be in the way. "Ye have not
passed this way heretofore." It was a new way, an "untrodden way."

We have now been for many years so accustomed to hear of the kind welcome given in Canada,
and the prosperity of the young emigrants, that we cannot realise the faith and courage required
by Miss Macpherson, and her co-worker, Miss Bilbrough. Many misgivings arose in the hearts
of some at the thought of these two sisters in the Lord arriving uninvited in a new land where
neither owned a friend, and, greatest of all, fears were entertained that those who had known
the wild roaming life of city Arabs might defy the control and authority of the leaders. But
how vain were all these fears! Wisdom had been asked of the Lord in every step of the way,
and He had given "liberally," according to His gracious word. How blessedly was the title of
Counsellor as well as Leader and Commander of His people then fulfilled! The following description
of the departure of the first party was written at the time:--

  "Our souls are in God's mighty hand,
  We're precious in His sight."

These words, sweet and true at all times, surely never sounded sweeter than when sung by the
band of young emigrants gathered for the last time within the walls of the Refuge, which to
many of them is hallowed as no other spot on earth can ever be. How precious in His sight,
none can tell but He who watched over those young wanderers, and surrounded them with the loving
care and prayers which still follow them to a distant land.

The beloved helpers at a distance, who have toiled, and collected, and borne to a throne of
grace the burdens of their beloved sister in the Lord, Miss Macpherson, will like to know every
detail, even to the outward appearance of those once ragged, shoeless wanderers. Now they stood
in ranks ready to depart, dressed in rough blue jackets, corduroy suits, and strong boots,
all made within the Refuge, the work of their own hands. All alike had scarlet comforters and
Glengarry caps; a canvas bag across their shoulders contained a change of linen for the voyage,
towels, tin can, bowl and mug, knife, fork, and spoon; and one kind friend, the last day before
starting, brought them a present of a hundred strong pocket-knives. A Bible, a "Pilgrim's Progress,"
and a little case of stationery, were provided for each, and while they stood thus indoors,
singing their last farewell, a dense crowd filled the street without, having waited for hours
in the pouring rain. It was with difficulty the police could keep struck with the sight of
the boys, all remarking that they had never seen more intelligent countenances, and one observed,
after hearing something of their history, "This is real religion."

Liverpool was reached at 4 A.M., and all went at once on board the "Peruvian." Then came a
trial of patience,--they had to wait some hours for breakfast,--but restraining grace was so
manifest throughout, that one's heart was continually lifted up in praise and thanksgiving
for this mercy as well as for countless others, and most especially for the loving-kindness
of the Lord in strengthening and supporting His beloved servants at the time of parting.

From want of space, it appeared impossible, (as far as could be judged from the first day's
experience), to gather all the boys together, but even amid the difficulties attending first
going on board, Miss Macpherson succeeded in holding a little service with a portion of them.
Some of the passengers and crew gathered round; all were remembered in her supplications, and
a deep solemnity rested on all. Then she called on those boys who knew what it was to draw
near with assurance to the throne of grace to ask for blessing, and, with her undaunted energy,
exhorted them not to be afraid to speak for Jesus. Prayer was followed by the oft-repeated hymn,--

  "There is a better world, they say,
  Oh, so bright!"

The tender brought on board a band of Christian friends, who once more thronged around her,
till the parting signal was given, and then the last sounds heard on leaving were, "Yes, we
part, but not for ever," and "Shall we gather at the river?"

The following note of cheer quickly arrived, to the joy of many anxious hearts and the praise
of a prayer-hearing God:--

"On Board the 'Peruvian,' off the Coast of Ireland, May 13, 1870.

"MY DEAR SISTERS,--Fearing lest in your anxiety for us you may have imagined a rough night
for the first, I send a few lines to assure you that all is love, even to the smallest details.
Each rolling wave reminds me of that word in the Epistle of James, 'Let him ask in faith, nothing
wavering. Thus trial sends us to Jesus, the Captain of our salvation. Oh, to win his soul to
look to Jesus for everlasting life!"

The following extract will tell the answer to the many prayers by which Miss Macpherson was
upheld, and how assuredly it was the Lord who had guided her way across the pathless deep:--

"Mr. Stafford, the agent at Quebec, would willingly have kept the hundred boys there, but we
only left him eleven, and brought the rest on to Montreal; and there too they were anxious
to keep them, and said if it were made known, in three days we should not have one remaining.
As it was, we left twenty-three, and all in excellent situations. Some of the best were picked
out, numbers of them as house-servants. Then we left eight at Belleville, half way between
Montreal and Toronto." These boys were left in charge of Mr. Leslie Thom, who had acted as
schoolmaster at the Home of Industry, and whose help was invaluable on arrival in the new country.

Miss Macpherson's youngest sister, Mrs. Birt, thus writes concerning the departure of the second
family, so readily sent out in answer to the invitations of dear friends in Canada:--

"I am sure our dear friends will feel exceedingly pleased and gratified to hear that the departure
of our second band of boys for Canada this year, under the care of Mr. Merry, took place on
the 21st of July, leaving our hearts filled to overflowing with thankfulness and praise for
the very marked way in which the Lord has led us on step by step.

"Little did we think, a month ago, that it would be possible in so short a time to select,
teach, and outfit seventy boys, and to soften their manners, even if we had the necessary money
for their expenses. But the Lord has most wonderfully brought it all about in His own way.
The money was sent, boys anxiously in search of employment came beseeching help, the needful
work for their outfits was accomplished in far less than the usual time by faithful widows,
who sewed away as diligently as though each had been making garments for her own son. An active,
earnest, clever teacher was also provided by the Lord, to give to these rescued ones that punctual
and diligent, daily attention that seemed to us so important. Even the postponement of their
sailing from the 14th inst. to the 21st inst. was overruled for good; Mr. Merry was enabled
to become more personally acquainted with each, and we know that 'the good seed of the Word'
was sown in many hearts, we trust to bear fruit. On reaching the ship, we were told that our
band would have the benefit of a place set apart for themselves, whereas, had they sailed the
previous week, they would have been crowded up with other emigrants. After three days' rest
we return, the Lord willing, to the Refuge, to select and prepare a band of young girls. Our
sister Miss Macpherson writes to us that she has been besought most earnestly by the Canadian
ladies to send them out some little English maids; and that they promise to watch over them
and care for them as if they were their own."

After the arrival of Mr. Merry in Canada with the second party of boys, Miss Macpherson returned
to England and wrote as follows:--

"My BELOVED FELLOW-LABOURERS,--You will be surprised to hear that, after a pleasant voyage,
with renewed health, I am again in my privileged place of service in the East of London. My
song of praise is very full. The Council of the county of Hastings has given me a house capable
of holding 200, free of all expenses, situated in the town of Belleville, Ontario, leaving
the management in my hands, entirely untrammelled by conditions. Thus a work of faith is now
commenced on Canadian shores, where our little street wanderers can at once be sent and trained
under our own schoolmaster, Mr. Leslie Thom. The life of my advantage& fountaines unbequeathed, my

 She would start some sunshiny morning on a week's
tour, dining with one farmer, having tea at another's, and passing the night at some special
friend's, Charlie, the mission horse, receiving the best of fare; while next day the farmer
harnesses his horse and takes her round to the neighbouring farms where the little English
emigrants have found a resting-place; and oh! the joy of these children to see again the well-remembered
face, and hear the cheery voice of her who had first seen and relieved their misery in the
old country, and now bringing fresh cheer and comfort in the new! With what haste the table
is spread and soon loaded with substantial food, and afterwards what opportunities arise for
a few words of counsel! Some verses are read from the Word of God, and then kneeling down,
we and the new friends would commit the child to the care of Him who has said, 'I will never
leave thee nor forsake thee.'

"Here, too, the numerous tracts and books brought from England, 'God's Way of Peace,' 'The
Blood of Jesus,' 'British Workman,' 'Band of Hope,' and 'The Christian,' often containing a
letter from Miss Macpherson, are eagerly sought after and read; and when passing along the
road, Charlie seems now instinctively to stop when meeting some pedestrian, that out of our
well-filled handbags may be given some tract or book."

The following is a record of days of travel in the backwoods:--

"MARCHMONT, BELLEVILLE, October.

"My friend Miss Bilbrough and I started, after an early dinner, from Marchmont, having declined
the kind offer of a friend's conveyance, preferring to go by the usual stage-waggon, as our
object was to study the country people, and know those with whom our little ones mingle. In
so doing we increase our opportunities of distributing books and tracts,--a new thing in these
outlying districts. We ask prayer for a blessing on these, and for every dear boy and girl
who has been under our care, that the Holy Spirit may bring to each mind the remembrance of
the truth in Jesus, which has been set before them. Our faith is from time to time strengthened
by seeing one after another joining the Lord's people.

"The novelty of our position was increased when the driver and our fellow-passengers, seven
in number, discovered that we were the friends of the orphan children. Their politeness was
touching. We had to take the best seat, the curtains were drawn down to shelter us from the
wind, and the driver strove to interest us by telling us histories of such of our boys as he
knew at different points of his journey.

"For miles the country seemed well cleared, except where portions of forest were left to supply
wood for the years to come. The cedar-rail fence and 'Concession roads' marked all into well-defined
portions. On these roads the homesteads are built in every variety of style, from the log-hut
built of cedar-trees laid one upon the other, cemented together, and roofed with bark, to the
stone and brick edifice, with barns and stables, and other surroundings, like unto one of our
own old country farmhouses.

"Our fellow-travellers were farmers, returning from Toronto Fair. They seemed amused and willing
to listen to our conversation with the driver, and received our books most politely.

"The 'lumbering district' stretched away northwards, some seventy-five miles from where the
giants of the forest had been felled. The recollections of our fellow-passengers were interesting
as to the few years ago, when the very country we were passing through was a dense mass of
similar unhewn timber. Now on every side there were homesteads telling of plenty, and enlivened
by rosy, healthy little ones. Who will question the desirability of thus peopling our Father's
glorious landscapes, and gathering up our poor perishing children from our overcrowded dens
and alleys, where they are dying by thousands yearly for want of pure air and sunshine, many
becoming criminals ere they scarce leave their mother's knee?

"The past encourages us to hope that He will not permit us to go before Him, and will both
send sufficient strength for the day, and sufficient means for the support of all He would
have us rescue from misery, by bringing them under the influences of a pious home, placing
them in Sabbath schools, and above all, gathering them beneath the sheltering wing of the loving
Shepherd.

"We arrive at length at Roslin, and soon find the pretty house of our friend Dr. H---, where
we are warmly greeted for the Master's sake, and ere long introduced to the only little baby
prattler, its mother, and her widowed sister. They had lived in the city, had visited the old
country, were friends of Mr. Gosse, and readers of 'The Christian.' Hence we soon found that
though in a Canadian backwood settlement, we had tastes and topics in common, and one longing
especially united us--the burden of precious souls to be won for Him we all loved.

"Through a chain of circumstances, Dr. B--- had obtained one of our boys, who had been engaged
in a similar capacity in a suburb of London, but had lost his situation, and become an orphaned
wanderer in our great city. His knowledge of dispensing was a recommendation for his appointment
to another doctor; and, to my great joy, hitherto he had conducted himself so well, that in
all the neighbourhood around other boys were so much in demand, that we now have no less than
forty children in that district among the farmers.

"My friend, ever a true helper as secretary, remembered that a small boy named Smith, who had
left a mother sorely fretting after him, lived near, and proposed to go and get a report of
him at once. The Doctor's conveyance soon was at the door, and in less than an hour my friend
returned with a bright account of the comfortable home and the happiness of its young inmate.

"The short hours after tea swiftly passed in conversing over the basket of books and tracts,
many of these the gathered-up stores of my friends, which when read had been sent to the Refuge,
and were now being spread freely in Canadian homes. We also talked over the principle which
we were endeavouring to work out with these friendless children, namely, that as the Lord Jesus
had given Himself to save us, so we ought to reach out the hand of love, and endeavour to snatch
others from lives of misery and want. If we cannot open our own doors to the lost and wayward;
ought we not to help in finding out those who can, that the lost and wandering lambs outside
in the wilderness might be gathered beneath a sheltering wing inside some happy fold?

"Dr. H--- and his intelligent wife and sister held a long conversation with us on the method
best suited for those whom we are seeking to benefit--whether to educate them for a series
of years in our institutions in the old country, or to afford them only a temporary residence
with us, where their character, temper, and talents could be studied for a few months with
a view to determine what family they would suit best. Our experience with the three hundred
children now placed out and watched over by our co-labourers in Canada brought us to the latter
conclusion, and the testimony of others in Germany was to the same effect.

"Pastor Zeller, who himself founded an orphan asylum at Beuggen, had long before strongly advocated
the placing of bereaved children in Christian families as the very best method of training
them. Commenting on this, M. de Liefde observes--'An establishment which contains from fifty
to seventy children (and this surely is only a small one), however well managed, cannot help
being unnatural in many respects. Nature seldom puts more than twelve children together in
one house; quite enough for a man and his wife to control, if due attention be given to the
formation of the different characters and the development of the various talents. The training
of a band of children beyond that number cannot help assuming the character of wholesale education.
The larger the number, the greater the resemblance of the establishment to a barrack; it becomes
a depot of ready-made young citizens, got up for social life at a fixed price, and within a
fixed period of time. No wonder that they often turn out unfit for practical realities, and
uncured of inveterate defects.' The noble Immanuel Wichern felt this objection so forcibly,
that his famous 'Rauhe Haus' institution is like a village of families, each homestead with
its house-father and house-mother, and its twelve boys or girls, as the case may be. He considered
that he could not otherwise do justice to those whom God had committed to his care than by
bringing the principles of family life to bear upon each individual.

"In the course of conversation we asked, how it was that so far from the city they had heard
of our having boys to dispose of, and it was pleasant to hear that the weekly 'Christian' was
the link that led them to depute a relative to watch for our passing through Montreal. Family
worship closed this day of sweet service.

"The next morning our kind host studied the various Concessions in which our children had been
located, and soon the 'democrat' (a peculiar carriage suited for this country) was brought
to the door, and the doctor, and his sister accompanied us for the day's drive.

"The day was balmy, like one of our bright June days, and beeches and maples, firs and cedars,
were beautiful to behold in their autumn loveliness.

"Our first call was at Mr. V---'s. He was a widower, and, finding his home lonely, had sought
at Marchmont for a little one to love and cheer him. He had taken the twin-like brothers, Freddy
and Tommy, whose sweet little faces bore some resemblance to his own. We found the children
at school, looking hearty and happy in the playground as we passed the schoolhouse. Mr. V---
was from home, but his mother, a pious woman, received us most kindly, and spoke affectionately
of the children. She took us to see her lovely flowerbeds of annuals, all laid out with taste
in front of the wooden house, and tended by her own hands when house-work was over. My heart
longed for the joy of telling the happiness of these children to the aged pious grandmother
pining away in want and sickness, and forsaken by her own son, the father of these boys.

"Passing onwards, we drove past a rosy-cheeked little fellow climbing a bank. A month in the
fresh air had so changed him from the delicate, pale, thin boy, that we looked again ere we
recognised Alfred Bonkin. His widowed mother will sing for joy to hear of his being thus educated,
clothed, and fed, and growing up to an honest life.

"Alfred was 'fixed up' (to use a Canadian term) with two others of our children in a family
settlement. One was a grown-up lad, employed in farm work, and the other a little matchbox-maker.
The venerable couple who had adopted them had won our hearts when calling upon us at the Home. *****

 But here we were found out, and invited to one of the loveliest country-seats
we had ever seen. It had been an old Indian settlement, and from its groves we had a view of
the distant woodlands clothed in richest foliage. On a beautiful lawn, the old Scotchman, with
tearful tenderness, fed our dear boys with unaccustomed dainties, and jugs full of new milk."

"In the evening a Scotchman arrived from a still more western district, Arkona, deputed by
his neighbours to come for seven more boys. We could, however, only spare him five. The boy
he took from us last year had behaved so well, that the demand had increased. Then came those
painful leave-takings; and to see great boys of sixteen and seventeen sobbing, was no easy
work for my clinging heart; but He who scattered His disciples, and went Himself by lonely
pathways, knew our need, even at this time."

"Next day we went farther inland, nine miles beyond the railroad, to Embro. There we found
'democrats,' each with a pair of horses, for the boys and luggage, in which they went off in
high glee, under the care of a good man of my own name; and for myself and friend, a Highlander
long frae the hills of our native land, had sent a carriage and pair of splendid spirited horses."

"Our party of boys had by this time considerably decreased; and had they been hundreds instead
of ones, of similarly trained boys, there would have been no difficulty in distributing them
into good homes."

"Canada is just now in a most prosperous state. Farmers' sons do not remain at home, but either,
enter professions or stores, or go farther West to colonise. Hence the need of further help,
which is met by our boys, who take their place, beginning with the A B C of farm-work, or,
as Canadians express it, 'choring round.'

"This new district was very pleasing to a Scotch eye--hill and dale, rich woods, substantial
farmhouses, richly cultivated orchards, beautiful with blossom; picturesque views of gushing
rivers in wild gorges, with grand old monarchs of the forest telling the tales of years gone
by, ere the emigrant's axe had laid their companions low."

"We reached a lovely village, and were warmly welcomed by 'Macs' of every name, reminding one
of childhood's summers spent in the Highlands of old Scotia. Here we were at home; the sweet
assurance of a Saviour's love shone in the faces that now surrounded us; we were on the trail
of an evangelist, and Jesus 'lifted-up' had been beheld, making faces beam with thankfulness
to Him who had given Himself for them."

"The kind McAuley, who had opened his house and heart in expectation of the whole twenty boys
from London, had himself been overwhelmed with love-offerings in the shape of food the good
neighbours had sent in, vying with each other in showing kindness to the orphan and the stranger.

"Ah! what a power and privilege is granted to us women, in that we are permitted to arise and
second the work of the evangelist by showing our faith by our works, and giving to the Christians
in this land of plenty and no poverty objects upon which to work out their love! Words fail
to depict the extreme tenderness and delicate attention shown to us, for Jesus' sake, during
the forty-eight hours we spent in the midst of this kindred people.

"In the evening the old Scotch kirk was filled to the door, and after the singing of some sweet
hymns and several heart-breathings of prayer, we spoke of the dealings of the Lord in this
mission among the children of our million-peopled city. Whilst doing this, it was difficult
to realise that we were not at home, among the dear brothers and sisters who are wont to meet
with us for prayer at the Home of Industry.

"The thank-offering to the Lord at the close was spontaneous, also the supply of food sent
in by the farmers, and which was sufficient for a hundred children. It seemed almost more than
my poor heart could bear when I called to mind the starving multitudes gathered in, and ravenously
devouring the morsel of bread dealt out to them in London. It made me long that the Christian
women of our land would rise up in some great national movement, and help many thousands of
our oppressed families to come out to this land of plenty, where millions of acres are crying
for labour. It is no romance nor ideal of a heated brain, but a plain, practical way of showing
our Christianity, this bearing the burdens of many a sinking, crushed-down family.

"The much-dreaded Canadian winter is really the most enjoyable period of the whole year, and
when it is over one hears of nothing but sorrow that 'winter's noo awa.'"

Miss Macpherson had intended returning to England in October, but was delayed for a time by
many calls for service. From Montreal she writes:--

"Strike another note of praise for the answer to the many prayers of our Glasgow fellow-labourers.
A friend in Scotland has been stirred up to give 2000 pounds in order to build an Emigration
Refuge in that city, that homeless lads may be trained for Canada. Let us unite in asking that
ere long similar Homes may be opened in Edinburgh and Liverpool, where poor and oppressed orphans
abound. Before returning to you, we trust that corresponding Homes on this side will be in
course of preparation, one in the East and another in the West, so that when the 150 young
emigrants arrive at Quebec, fifty can proceed at once to each Home for distribution.

"We leave Marchmont accompanied in our mission carriage by two boys; and these two have histories
which contain a lesson for all boys. Their antecedents in England were much the same--orphanage,
want of caretakers, misery. One is still self-willed, having no mercy on himself, a runaway
from the home in which we had placed him, and was brought to us a second time by the police
as homeless. We are now taking him back to his master to hear all about the grievances, and
find out that they arose from his determination not to go to school. A boy that does not value
the opportunities afforded him, but prefers growing up in ignorance, must suffer for it sooner
or later. May all boys who read this determine to apply themselves to every lesson heartily;
each difficulty overcome will render it more easy to master the next.

"The other boy was one of the first hundred; he arrived by train from Toronto at midnight,
and rang us up, expecting admittance, for he felt that he was coming home to see his friends,
his master having given him a holiday. This boy, though utterly alone in the world, snatched
by us from a life in London stables, stands there, at fourteen, a self-reliant little man,
with his purpose in life clearly defined. He is not many minutes in the house before he discloses
the joy it is to come home, and tells us how he has as good a suit of Sunday-clothes to put
on as any gentleman.

"Next morning he sits during Bible-lesson in the schoolroom side by side with the ne'er-do-weel.
Both are received for Jesus' sake, the one in his poverty and self-will, the other in his good
suit and self-complacency, but both still wanting the 'one thing needful' to fit them for the
home and mansions on high. Whilst endeavouring to explain how Jesus had loved them, and wrought
out a righteousness for them, and was as willing to receive them as we had been, and that He
had a large and loving heart, and cared for the many hundreds still wandering about in the
great city, tears filled the eyes of the little group. Just picture what we felt as J--- P---,
in the most humble and childlike way, put his hand in his pocket and drew out twenty-five dollars,
saying, 'Miss, that will bring another.'

"My words ceased, and a choking feeling came into my throat as the lesson was being learnt
by half-a-dozen of self-willed returned boys. Much we longed that all our children could have
witnessed this scene. Very few of them, except the selfish and depraved, would like to be behind
J--- P--- in having the privilege of giving us so much encouragement in this work.

"The first year J--- P--- received no wagers, only his food and clothes; now, his services
having become valuable, he gets six dollars a month. He has purchased for himself a silver
watch, a good overcoat, and has also returned most honourably his passage-money, therefore
he has received his neatly framed and beautifully illuminated discharge, to hang up, showing
he is now no longer a poor emigrant.

"J--- holds that the habit of saving the cents is the secret of success, and he intends plodding
on until he can purchase a farm of his own, and we think it will not be very long before he
does so, if his life is spared. Thus he accompanies us as a son, and as such is received and
lodged in the various homes we visit.

"It was most amusing to hear him tell the runaway sitting by him in the carriage how to get
on and advise him not to give way to his own will and his own temper.

"By boys this advice is more easily given than taken, as was proved in this case. We left the
boy on his promising that he would be obedient and go to school. But the subtle enemy, ere
the day was out, gave this boy of fourteen years old the idea of being his own master, rather
than live out that wondrous word of four letters, obey. Again he escaped from a good home,
and after wandering many miles, knocked late at night at a ferryman's, and asked for food.
Here Robert Jack, a kind Scotchman, recognised the English corduroy, and at once met him with,
'You are one of Miss Macpherson's' boys.' He was fed and lodged, and strange to say, next day
we were led, in the course of our journey, to cross that very ferry. The young runaway seeing
us from the window exclaimed, 'Oh! here comes Mr. Thorn,' and would have hidden away from our
sight, knowing he was doing wrong, for he would not understand that we were his friends, willing
to help and love him. Oh, may all boys who read this seek earnestly to believe that Jesus is
their very best Friend, and He only can remove their self-will and blindness of heart!

"In crossing the ferry early in the summer, we had spoken faithfully to this ferryman, and
had sent him the 'Life of Robert Annan' by post. They had been schoolfellows together, and
after reading the book, he got many others to read it also. This small sixpenny gift, accompanied
by prayer, had done a work. Robert was willing to become a co-worker with us, and is now trying
to train to honest industry our little self-willed runaway. Thus we hope that in the log-hut
of the Scottish ferryman he may learn to read and write, and that the blessed Spirit will work
on the hearts of both master and boy.

"The experience of yearning over this orphan boy moved our hearts to speak of Jesus, who bore
with such long-suffering love our own rebelliousness ere we came to Him."

The story has been told before of the first poor girl rescued in the East of London through
Miss Macpherson's blessed agency, one whose father had died suddenly of cholera, whose mother
had thrown herself into a canal, and, though rescued, had been, through drink, a source of
misery to her children. The eldest brother [Footnote: This boy, now a shoemaker, has written
asking to be allowed to have one of the lads, as an apprentice.] of this poor girl, about sixteen
years of age, had been brought out the previous year to Canada, and appearing one day at Marchmont,
I thought from his looks and dress that he was one of the farmers' sons come to engage a boy,
little thinking that so short a time had passed since he was destitute as the poorest among them.

In England we are so accustomed to the sorrowful sight of neglected children, it can hardly
be imagined by us how such a fact strikes a Canadian. Often have I seen the tears in the eyes
of the farmers at the sight of little ones brought so far to seek a home at such an early age.
This was especially the case with regard to little Annie referred to in the following lines,
the youngest of three sisters left motherless in a workhouse. When I last saw this little sufferer
health and strength had been given to her, and she was the pet of all in a home of comfort.

  "OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES AND SUCKLINGS."

  "From the mouths of babes and sucklings,"
    Was the Psalmist's grateful word,
  "Thou hast perfected Thy praises,"
    And I thank Thee, gracious Lord.

  And e'en yet from infant voices
    Words of wondrous meaning fall,
  And the Christian's heart rejoices,
    For he knows his Father's call.

  Little Annie sat beside me,
    Smiles upon her baby face;
  Early sorrow, early suffering,
    On her cheek had left their trace.

  Little feet, too weak to wander
    Where the merry children play;
  'Neath the flickering aspen shadows,
    By broad Quinte's sunny bay.

  Thoughts of pitying love came thronging
    As I thought how Jesus came;
  How He blessed the little children,
    How He healed the sick and lame.

  So I asked the little maiden,
    "Annie, Jesus cares for you--
  If we saw Him now beside us,
    Can you think what He would do?"

  Strangely solemn, seemed the answer,
    (Listen, sisters o'er the sea);
  "Jesus, just to you would give me,
    And would bid you care for me."

  English sisters, rich and gifted!
    Ask your hearts, Can this be true?
  Christ hath many a homeless orphan,
    Is He saying this to you?

  "Take this child and nurse it for Me?"
    Will you dare to say Him nay?
  Dare to let His children perish,
    Or in evil paths to stray?

  If too stately are your dwellings,
    Send them hither, let them come;
  In our fair Canadian homesteads,
    Gladly we will make them room.

  Room where orchard boughs are dropping
    Fruit that waits their hands to pull;
  Room to rest, and room to labour,
    Room in home, in church, in school.

  When the winter snow lies sparkling,
    They shall share our winter joys,
  Tinkling bells and merry sleigh-ride,
    With our laughing girls and boys.

  When our maple pours its nectar,
    They shall share the luscious treat;
  Where the woodland strawb'ries cluster,
    Glad shall stray their little feet.

  When our Sabbath-scholars gather,
    They shall join the joyous throng;
  Sweet will sound their English voices,
    'Mid the burst of children's song.

  Sisters, shall we share the blessing?
    Bring the lambs to Jesu's fold?
  Ours are homes of peace and plenty,
    To your hands He gives the gold.

  S. R. GELDARD.

In her first letter on returning to England Miss Macpherson writes:--

"BELOVED FELLOW-WORKERS,--Once more at home among the old familiar scenes in the East of London,
the sadness and the sin shadows our joy and thanksgiving. My first visit in the immediate vicinity
of the Refuge I shall not soon forget.

"Taking good news of Andrew in Canada to his mother, I found his father lying dead drunk in
one corner, and his little brother lying dead waiting to be carried off to the grave by the
parish in the other.

"In the first low women's lodging-house, I found a poor misguided girl asking me, 'How's my
little sister?'

"Passing on to Mr. Holland in George Yard, I cheered him with answers to his many inquiries
as to the placing out of his rescued ones.

"Many a warm shake of the hand I had from poor costermongers and grey-headed men, for what
had been done for their belongings in taking them from the sin and want around.

"My way is now open to go forward, as means permit, to rescue girls and train them for Canada
or for service in England."

Miss Macpherson goes on to tell of the purchase of the Galt Home, 300 miles westward, and states
the need in these words:--

"We found that to educate our Canadian family, and thoroughly fit them to be of value to the
farmer, a few fields to work upon would be an advantage, that they might see the effects of
new soil and climate, in the growth of vegetables, shrubs, and farm produce."

"Thou hast tried us as silver is tried. We went through fire and through water, but Thou broughtest
us out into a wealthy place." This was the experience of the beginning of the year 1872. Miss
Bilbrough's letter brings to mind Deut. xxxiii. 12.

"BELLEVILLE, January 29, 1872.

"DEAREST ANNIE,--It is indeed difficult to begin a letter to you, when I know you always open
our letters feeling sure of good news. And yet this one brings you the best you ever had. Lives
spared, I trust, to work more than ever for Him who hath done such great things for us. Our
song is one of continual thankfulness and praise, and I know you will join us in giving thanks.
Our beautiful Home lies in ruins, only the walls standing, and there is one little grave dug
by Benjamin Stanley's, containing the ashes of little Robbie Gray.

"I hardly know how to begin, it still seems so terrible and real.

"We had had a happy Sabbath. We were to have an early breakfast next morning, and I awoke in
the night thinking it was daylight. Miss Baylis came to my door, which was shut, saying, 'Miss
Bilbrough, there's smoke!'

"I jumped up, and oh, the feeling, when I saw the house full of dense white smoke! I knew well
what it must be. I rushed to Mr. Thorn's room, he was sleeping heavily, but I roused him, saying
the house was on fire; then I went down to the boys, Philips and Keen, who were in the schoolroom,
called them up and told them to save the children, and rushed upstairs, nearly choked, calling
'Fire!'

"Mrs. Wade, Miss Baylis, Miss Moore, all came out. Downstairs I ran again and unfastened the
front door, and went to the corner of the verandah. Philips was getting out the children, and
the flames were coming on with frightful rapidity; it was blowing a perfect hurricane, and
the whole building was enveloped in smoke and ashes; I ran back half-way upstairs to see if
I could get a dress, or my cash-box, or watch, but I was too much suffocated, and had to get
back to the front door. Mrs. Wade, Miss Baylis, and the children, were making for the fence.
I saw Mr. Thorn, and called to him to search again with Philips for the children.

"The intense cold in the snow seemed almost worse to bear than fire. We all climbed the fence
and ran to the nearest house. Poor Mrs. Wade had got her hands frozen, even in that short time,
as the thermometer was about twelve or fifteen degrees below zero.

"Here we called over the names of the children; some were here, some in another house, sitting
over the stove with bare legs and only their little shirts on. Soon little Robbie was found
missing, but Philips had lifted him out, and he had been seen running with the others; we suppose
that the poor child, blinded with smoke, ran to the front door, and then went through into
the schoolroom, the place he knew best, where he must soon have been suffocated. It was all
over in a few minutes, all around was fearfully bright and lurid. The engine came, but was
of course too late, the fire spread with such terrible rapidity.

"We sat almost stunned with fright and cold. Soon the Shearings and Elliotts came, bringing
clothes, &c., and we went to dear Mrs. Elliott's house in a sleigh. It was not four A.M., and
the fire was almost out, burning round the verandah and the window-sills.

"Oh, how our hearts went up in thankfulness to God for sparing mercies! A few moments more,
and we dread to think of what might have been. Miss Baylis' door being ajar, the smoke got
in; mine was shut, my room was free, but I saw the light on the window. Miss Moore was in Miss
Lowe's bedroom; she could not realise it, and, after being first roused, was going to bed again.

"As soon as it was daylight I went with Mr. Thorn to see the ruins. All around the melted snow
had frozen like iron; the thermometer, which was hung on the verandah, was found uninjured;
nothing was found but a table and one stove; all gone. Books, papers, clothes, everything;
but there in the blackened ruin lay distinctly the charred frame of little Robbie. Mr. Thorn
went for Dr. Holden and a coffin, and the remains were brought to Mr. Elliott. Dear little
fellow, he was the most prepared of any of the little ones to go. This is such a comfort to me now.

"I had gathered the little ones round me in the evening before the fire, when the others were
at church, and we had sung some sweet hymns. I made Robbie especially stand beside me, and
made him sing alone. 'I will sing for Jesus,' was the hymn he chose. He sang it sweetly. How
little did I think in a few hours he would be singing the 'new song' before the throne! His
history in our book is very touching. 'Robert Gray, aged six; a happy little man, who can say
little or nothing about himself.' The rest of the page is blank, as he had never been away
from Marchmont. An inquest was held over the body. We wished it especially, so that we might
have an investigation as to the cause of the fire.

"Dearest Annie, when I think what it might have been, and the grief of all at home, and the
intense sorrow, oh, it makes one so thankful! I felt Jesus very precious through it all, recognising
His hand in so many ways. I had had much blessed communion with Him that Sunday, and several
seasons of sweet prayer. I can fully realise that for me it would have been all right, if the
Lord had ordered it otherwise; but for the sake of those at home I bless God for life spared,
and trust earnestly the Lord may give us all increased power and spiritual life. Having passed
through 'the fire,' may we also receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And oh, may our lives
be more and more devoted to His service! Not our own, but bought with a price, may we live
more and more unto Him who hath loved us!

"Miss Moore was out at nine o'clock in the woodshed; all was safe then. Mrs. Wade locked the
doors at ten with stable lantern in the wood-shed (the boys' summer dining-room), and then
all was safe; the fire in the kitchen stove was out. She came shivering in to-prayers a little
after ten. The parlour fire was nearly out, and Miss Baylis and I were quite cold. The fire
upstairs was not lit, nor had any ashes been taken up on Sunday morning. If any had been removed
on Saturday, they were placed in iron vessels in the first kitchen. The fire broke out in the
further corner of the wood-shed. The cause is so far quite unknown, and will, I suppose, ever
remain so.

"I send you the account of the inquest, and other papers, as I know well it is better to see
and know all particulars. I cannot, however, tell of all the kindness and sympathy we have
met with--a telegram from Mr. Claxton, offering money, &c., Hon. George Alien wishing to take
the children; Mr. Eason: 'I am praying for you, can I help by coming?' numbers of friends coming
with clothes of every kind; subscriptions got up to start a new Home immediately; sewing societies
at work and ladies canvassing the town in every direction for help to furnish another Home
at once. I could not even begin to particularise our friends. Mr. Flint came up at eight, begging
me to come to his house.

"This afternoon we have buried little Robin. The service was held in Mr. Elliott's church.

"How often we have thought of home friends during the last few days, and longed that you might
not hear the news in any way till this reaches you, which will be nearly three weeks! and now
you must fancy us happy at our work again, and as much under the loving care and protection
of our God as ever, trusting only to Him for everything, that whether absent from the body,
or still in the flesh, we may be more and more filled with faith and love for the Lord's work.

"Wednesday. We seem each day to realise only more fully our marvellous escape. The firemen
say they never remember such a night, nor saw a house burn so rapidly. Now every one is so
kind; things keep pouring in for the new Home;--it is to be Canadian this time, not English.
Mr. Flint says he has written to you, telling you all, but he could not tell you one quarter
of the kindness we have met with on every hand.

"Oh, that verse in Isa. lxiv. II, is so expressive:

"'Our beautiful house where we praised Thee is burnt up with fire, and all our pleasant things
are laid waste.' What a ruin Marchmont is now! the blackened ashes all around--nothing but
the walls standing. I feel such mingled feelings as I look at it--all the happy days we have
spent there--the holy associations never to return again.

"'We have no continuing city here,' was the text which filled Mr. Thorn's mind, and it is one
we hope more than ever to keep before us. This trial seems to have given the four of us deeper
sympathy and interest together. So nearly entering eternity together, and yet saved, we trust,
to render more devoted service to the Master, for having passed through this fiery trial.

"I can hardly bear to think of all the sorrow you are feeling for us; but oh! let thanksgiving
and praise be uppermost. It is the one thought that fills our minds. We are wonderful in health,
no cold, and are as occupied as possible, looking after the children, and preparing for the
new Home. Happily, Charlie the horse, the sleigh, and the buffalo robes are safe, and most
useful we find them now.

"I am so thankful that it will be nearly three weeks ere you know, and you must think of it
as past and gone, and, if possible, just at first see the beginning of great good in making
the work more known, and rousing the sympathies of others."

      What, Marchmont gone!
  That pleasant Home nought but a memory now;
  And yet, in humble thankfulness we bow,--
      Father, Thy will be done.

      It was but lent:
  Thou wilt not that Thy children fix their heart
  On aught below: theirs is a better part--
      A treasury unspent.

      Still are its memories dear!
  The maple shadows that around it lay,
  Stirred by the breezes from the silvery bay,
      Or bathed in moonlight clear--

      How fair were they!
  Lovely when decked with earliest buds of spring,
  Loveliest when radiant autumn came to fling
      A glory on each spray.

      Oh home of praise and prayer!
  Where glad sweet voices raised the morning hymn,
  Pleaded for blessing in the twilight dim,
      Or thrilled the midnight air.

      Can we forget
  The meetings and the partings we have known?
  The welcome glad, the farewell's sadder tone--
      Ah, we remember yet.

      We were not there
  When thro' its halls the fierce destroyer swept;
  But God was watching, while our dear ones slept--
      Safe were they in His care.

      All safe with Him;
  Yes, for our Robbie "sings for Jesus" now
  In sweeter tones, with far more sunny brow,
      And eyes no tear's can dim.

      They wait His word--
  Stanley and Robbie side by side--and we
  Caught up together with them soon shall be
      For ever with the Lord.

  S. R. GELDARD.

All former kindness was as nothing compared to that now received, as will be seen by the following
from Miss Bilbrough:--

"BELLEVILLE, February 2, 1872.

"I know that many many prayers are now being offered for us, and that the Lord is answering
them every minute, giving us sustaining grace and wisdom, and help as to the future. I knew
it would be five weeks before I could hear from you, and I could trust that all we might arrange
here would meet your approval, as it has generally done.

"However, the Belleville people, with Mr. Flint at their head, quite took the matter out of
my hand, being determined that they would provide and furnish themselves a still better house
than Marchmont. The sympathy awakened is great, and the pleasure of friends at hearing that
we could have a large substantial house on the Kingston Road for our orphan children was equally
so. Mr. Flint has secured it for three years, the Council paying the rent and taxes, and sufficient
is already gathered to furnish it. So that when the first arrivals come in May, all will be
ready for them.

"How good the Lord is! even out of apparent trial He brings the good. We had been praying for
special blessing, and in this way, (strange as it seems to us), we do recognise the answer."

In March, Miss Macpherson writes:--

"BELOVED FRIENDS,--While you are reading this, my pathway will again be upon the mighty deep.
The Lord willing, I look to leave Liverpool by steam-ship 'Scandinavian,' March 7th. Miss Reavell,
who has for two years been our scribe in the Refuge, accompanies me. Your prayers have gone
up that blessing may be ours, as a little band of feeble workers for our Lord, and if He has
been pleased to try our faith by the trial of fire, shall we not praise Him for anything His
loving hand doth send us? And as one has beautifully said, 'What God takes it is always gain
to lose.' Heaven is nearer now our little Robbie is there; Jesus is dearer, and has quickened
us all by His constraining love.

"My object in going now to Canada without children is twofold. Strength being given, my desire
is to visit the new districts, where I hope in the coming summer to place out the hundreds
now under excellent training and holy influence here and in Scotland, and to find out Christian
families who may be willing to receive them on arrival. Cannot Lawdee'best Nanny that i had,

The visit of Miss Barber, a Canadian lady of influence, to the Home of Industry, was the means
of interesting friends in the Eastern Townships' Province of Quebec, and of leading them to
open a Home at Knowlton.

The following letter is from Miss Macpherson:--

"The year's experiment in this new district will enable us to test it as to whether it will
be a suitable one for our children; if so, it will not cost many pounds of English money. The
old house we have taken was formerly a tavern, and its ball-room will make us an excellent
dormitory; the rent is only 20 pounds, and is paid entirely by a Canadian. Should the children
thrive under the fostering care of our dear friend Miss Barber (now doubly dear to us all after
the winter of help she has given us in the East of London), there will be no difficulty in
establishing a permanent Home, built of brick, half of the necessary sum having already been
subscribed in and around Sheffield, Leeds, and Nottingham; and the other half our friends in
the province of Quebec have freely offered to collect. Thus will those both on this side and
at home share the benefits; the old country seeing hundreds educated that might otherwise in
a few years become expensive criminals, and the new country, receiving, ere habits are fixed,
young life which, in future, will call Canada 'the home of its adoption.'

"Though, according to all accounts, this is an uncommonly heavy snow-season, I have no fears
for the children, the air is so dry and clear, and well fitted to invigorate their frames.
This morning I started about five o'clock, and soon forgot the fear which had crept over me
but a week ago, when I took my first winter journey among these snowy hills. 'Knowledge is
power,' and the experience of dangers met and passed gives quietness and confidence.

"You will be imagining that owing to these prolonged snow-storms all work is stayed. Not so;
everything goes on most vigorously-- lumbering, carting, cutting wood for summer's need. Ladies
seem always busy; yet as it is often seen, those who have most to do can best arrange to be
at leisure. There is an education of forethought caused by having to watch against the heat
and cold; this has deeply interested me in the practical manner in which they are going to
work in furnishing this Eastern Townships' Home. In return for the kindness shown to this Mission,
may the whole district be spiritually blessed, and may our loving Lord be the joy and strength
of each faithful labourer!

"The heavy calamity that it pleased our Father to send by fire, has accomplished in a few weeks
that which would otherwise, humanly speaking, have taken many years to make known. Our motives
and principles of service were all new, and even our simple faith and trust in prayer were
often misunderstood. Though we had travelled several thousands of miles in Canada, seeking
to stir up Christians to aid us in finding and watching over the right home for our children,
we had no medium on this side like 'The Christian,' by which we could communicate with those
like-minded, and tell them of our burdens.

"The Hon. B. Flint tells us how the hearts of his fellow-townsmen were moved with compassion
on hearing of the destruction of the Children's Home, on that terrible night, and that some
of them attempted to ascend the hill and offer aid, but had to turn back, unable to face the
hurricane and tempest.

"The citizens of Belleville have contributed freely towards replacing the Home, and the Lord's
dear children all over the land have sent their love-offerings. The County Council received
testimonies from many of the homesteads concerning the six hundred children placed out round
Belleville, and generously contributed 500 dollars to show their esteem for the work. Parent, i may

 There stood
Jamie D--, who, with his little brother Hughie, formed one of the saddest photographs of childish
wretchedness even Glasgow streets could produce; so bright, so well-dressed, though still with
a little of the old look of childish care. William C--, the little fellow of four years old,
whose mother died in India, and the father on his return sank in a London hospital, leaving
little Willie friendless, was here with a lovely bunch of hot-house flowers ready to present
to Miss Macpherson, and to receive from her one of the beautifully illustrated scrap-books
made by little English children. Willie has been nearly three years in his happy home, surrounded
by all the influences of education and refinement.

"Now the friends were gathering thickly, and listened while an earnest address was given to
the boys by Miss Macpherson. When she ceased, first one and then another gentleman stood up
and gave their earnest, hearty sympathy with and approval of the work, and of the character
of the boys. And here I must tell you, in passing, we attribute much to the loving, tender
training of your Hampton Home. It is not that Canadian farmers would put up with anything,
or that a bad boy is so useful that his faults are overlooked; for here every single boy is
thoroughly known, and discussed over all the country side. Mr. Grover, from the village of
Colborne, quite cheered our hearts with the good accounts of the twenty in his neighbourhood,
most of whom have joined his classes, and by their steady industrious conduct are recommending
themselves.

"He said, 'I do not speak without personal experience. W. O--- has been two years in my employ,
and a more truthful, upright, honest boy, I would not wish to have; he has left now to learn
further about farming, and I immediately applied for another one from Marchmont, and believe
W. S--- will prove as successful and honest a servant.' Then the Rev. William Bell stood up
and bore testimony to your favourite Tommy--one of the rescues from Mr. Holland's Shelter,
in 1869. 'I have boarded now over a year in the good farmer's home, where Tommy S---lives.
He is as good, and truthful, and honest a boy as I would wish to have about a house; and his
master so appreciates his services that he gives him fifty dollars for his first year. These
boys are in every way a blessing, and advantage to our country.' Mr. V., who has been already
alluded to, said, 'I sought guidance and direction from the Lord before I came to the Home,
now nearly three years ago, and then I only intended to take one boy; I have never regretted
I took two. Except one or two days, they have never missed school; indeed I do not believe
any one could hire them to stay away. I know that their labour morning and evening repays me
for any expense I am at, and they can be at school all the time.' Miss Macpherson then told
these two boys, F--- and T---, of her last visit to their grandmother in the tidy attic in
Bethnal Green, and how pleased she was to receive the five dollars they had sent her. Mr. Ward,
a farmer from Sidney, had brought his little boy, Tommy S---; and Johnnie, the brother, had
come from a home across the Bay of Quinte. So there was a touching meeting, and many experiences
for the two brothers to relate, during one month's absence. Mr. Ward told how he intended to
educate his boy, and trusted he might yet fill some prominent position, for which by natural
gifts he seemed well qualified. Speaking of the religious character of the work, he said, 'I
asked him who had taught him so much of Jesus? He told me he did not even know who He was till
he was taken into the Refuge; but now he knows about Him, and of His love for little children.'
I know you will like to hear particulars of H. W---, whose sad history excited so much sympathy,
and for whom the noble-man's little son gave up his pet pony that he might have the money to
emigrate him. Well, you could not tell the round-faced, happy boy, to be the same. He brought
four dollars he had earned towards his passage money; is in a good home, and doing well. Also
of George and Mary F---, who met, after ten months' separation, so changed that they hardly
recognised each other. How it would cheer their kind rescuer's heart (Mr. George Holland) could
he see them now! but I knew nothing, not even such joy as this, could tempt him away from his
special work; so I sent the children, to their great delight, to the town to get their likenesses
taken to send him.

"Altogether the day was a most happy one. But no onlooker could fully understand the deep,
rich joy of looking into those happy faces. Only those who had watched over and prayed with
them from the beginning could at all enter into this peculiar feeling; and many earnest prayers
ascended that these loving, tender hearts might be won for the Saviour, and from among them
many ambassadors for Jesus might yet go forth.

"My very dear Sister,--Could you but see me this morning, started on my peregrinations in these
snowy regions, you would be amazed. The poor worn head perfectly well, after a whole week in
the quiet, restful Home at Knowlton, where children are being trained, sewing-meetings and
Bible-readings held, farmers conversed with, and my privilege has been to hold up the hands
of my two companions, who went forth to address Sunday-schools or to preach the gospel.

"Fancy me starting yesterday morning, fixed up in my delightfully warm fur cloak, and many
other ingenious devices, to defy the cold, wintry blast, a drive of eighteen miles. During
the journey we stopped twice. The first time we met with one of our once poor, pale-faced rescues,
Katie D---. What a change, now happy and useful, compared to the time when we sheltered her
from the dreaded return of her drunken father from prison!

"As the night closed in, the cold caused us to hasten to our journey's end as quickly as the
strength of our Home horse would admit of. But cheery was it to be told by our friend, as we
passed one farmhouse after another, 'We have a boy here and a girl there doing well.' Sometimes
it would be, 'We have had to move a boy; his temper did not suit; but since he has been back
to the Home, and placed out again with a firmer master, he is doing much better.' A very hearty
Canadian welcome awaited us. Ushered into a warm room, our wraps taken off, soon we were seated,
enjoying a 'high' tea. It snowed all night, and drifted in at every crevice of our bedroom window.

"Snow fell all day, and to my idea it seemed improbable for many to gather for a meeting. The
village street was enlivened all day by the constant passing of the sleighs, with merry jingle
of bells. It was indeed a new scene to witness the gathering of a meeting to hear of the orphan
and destitute children, whose cause we had come to plead, and contradict a report which had
gone forth in their district, that it was a mass of jail-birds we had brought from England.

"As we arrived, a farmer kindly offered to broom the snow from our feet--a process all seemed
prepared to do for each other. Then, in a good-sized hall, about fifty of all ages gathered
around an immense stove--ministers, doctors, and farmers, with their belongings. Chairs in
front of the stove were set for the minister and myself.

"After singing 'Rock of Ages,' etc., and prayer, it was so like a family, that it became easy
just to tell real story after story as to how we find the children, where the means come from,
and what is required of those who receive them.

"The minister then present was one who, having heard of the work at the commencement; had gone
to the Home and received little Bessie, aged ten. She now came up and gave me a hearty kiss,
and then, so childlike, showed me her new winter garments. Now who was Bessie? The child of
a surgeon who had rained his family by intemperance. The mother, a teacher in a ladies' school
in Germany, earning her own bread, after a long and heavy struggle. Bessie is loved and is
being educated in everything to make her a useful woman.

"Next morning we started for visits to several children. Found the first child gone to school.
We saw her looking well as we passed the school-house, and called her out. All we saw that
day filled our hearts with deepest thankfulness. The meeting in the evening was held in the
Congregational Church, well warmed and lighted, and a most intelligent-looking gathering. Ere
long I espied one of the orphan lads, and called him to me, that he might speak for himself,
knowing that his own words would endorse the work more forcibly than anything I could say.
He was a bright, intellectual looking youth of fourteen, who in a most manly way answered me
a few questions. In this way we are securing the prayers of God's dear children, and, we trust,
opening many a heart and home for those who may yet come forth from the dens of sin and iniquity
of our great cities.

"Our Canadian horse seemed to enjoy the snow as much as we did, even though the depth had tripled
since our leaving home. How much on this journey we have learnt of the continued loving-kindness
of our covenant-keeping God, making our fears fly, and giving protection from the stormy blasts,
in forms so comparatively new to us. Every person is so kind to us that we are so glad we have
been led to yield to this service as a child. Many a door, we trust, will soon be wide open
for earnest evangelists to come and be fresh voices, cheering our brethren who are labouring
on in these small towns away from the front.

"Pray on for us, as a band, that we take not one step before the Lord, but that we hold not
back on account of our weakness or the fear of man. Ask for us that we may each one live so
close to the Lord, that we may be fitted to deal personally with those we meet with.

"We are frequently holding up your hands and praying that daily the Lord will send the means
with the children, and that you all be sustained in health. Grace and peace be with you all--Yours,
in sweet fellowship, A. MP.

"Eastern Townships, Prov. of Quebec, November 18, 1873."

In March, 1874, Miss Macpherson returned from Canada filled with praise for the encouragement
met with. She had been enabled to plead the cause of her children before many in positions
of influence, judges, merchants, lawyers, and doctors. A choice of two hundred homes, amidst
the love and affluence of that country, were now awaiting her little rescued ones. Her own
joy was increased by receiving the letter of which she thus writes:--

"The enclosed letter will cheer our brother Dr. Barnardo, by showing what a home God has provided
for a dear little boy he was permitted to rescue and train. Surely the departed mother, from
whom our brother received the child, would feel that the Lord is indeed the Father of the fatherless.

'DEAR MISS,--I embrace this early opportunity of letting you know how well pleased we all are
with, and how much we like, little Henry Tuppen. He is such a willing, obedient, and loving
fellow, he has won all our hearts, and we feel very much attached to him already. Many, very
many thanks to you and your fellow-labourers for the invaluable, yes, priceless, lessons he
has received under your kind care. Surely this is much more than "the cup of cold water," and
"you shall in no wise lose your reward." Oh, may we discharge our duty as you have towards
this dear little orphan! My visit to you and your home that morning was a great blessing to
me; never shall I forget it. To hear that dear little fellow sing "Bright Jewels," and look
around over the group of little ones, far from native home, and father and mother, brother
and sister, and think, "These are the jewels, precious jewels," it seemed to bring heaven near.
And truly the Saviour was present. I never think of it but the tear starts, and a silent prayer
is offered that the Lord will give them all good Christian homes, and that they may be all
'bright jewels,' and great shall be your reward. Their heavenly Father sees it all.

'But I am forgetting my main object in writing to you, which is to ask you if the little girl,
the elder of the two whom we saw, is yet provided with a home. If not, we have room for her,
and should be glad to have her. She would be such good company for my sister, who is at home
with mother. She would be treated in every way as a daughter and a sister. Father is very sorry
he did not bring her that morning. It seems he thought of it then, but wished to talk it over
with the rest of the family.'"

Miss Macpherson adds:--

"Who is the little girl asked for to become a daughter and sister? None other than the little
Eliza who was found deserted seven years ago, when only a few weeks old, and who has been most
carefully trained since then by our beloved sister-labourer, Miss Mittendorf, whose toil among
infant wanderers deserves the deepest gratitude of the children of God."

The Homes at Hampton, endeared as they were by recollections of many blessings, were this year
vacated. The distance from Spitalfields had always been a great strain on the strength of wearied
workers, and both time and fatigue were spared by removal to Hackney.

The opening of this Home is thus mentioned:--

November 5, 1874.

"On Saturday, the New Home situated in London-fields was opened with prayer and thanksgiving.
It consists of two large old-fashioned houses thrown into one, and the situation is, for the
neighbourhood, remarkably open and airy. Many friends assembled, Mr. Dobbin presided, and suggested,
at the opening of the meeting, an analogy between the Home of Industry, with its various stations,
and the pool of Bethesda 'having five porches.' Much prayer, and praise followed, and worshipful
hearts told themselves out in love and adoration. Such hymns as 'Call them in,' 'Till He come,'
and 'More to Follow,' aptly expressed the aspirations and hopes of the earnest workers. Mr.
Merry, Mr. Maude, and others spoke, and then Mrs. Birt, only two days since returned from Nova
Scotia, gave accounts of the success of the recent voyage, when eighty-three rescued children
found happy homes on the other side of the water, and most touching particulars of the death
of little Dickie, who went actually into the earthly harbour, and entered the heavenly haven
of rest at the same time. In the bustle of arrival, 'he was not, for God took him.'"

The Home of Industry has been already likened to the Pool of Bethesda with its fine porches.
Many sights there have been peculiar to itself, and in no instance has this in past years been
more remarkable, than in the meeting for Jewesses, which has been carried on ever since the
year 1870. From fifty to seventy daughters of Israel are gathered weekly, through the Lord's
blessing on the patient, unwearied labours of his honoured servant Mrs. Way. Greatly indeed
should she be honoured, for she diligently sought out these lost sheep, when few comparatively
could be found to "care for their souls." When first told of "the name at which every knee
shall bow," much scorn and contempt were manifested, but Mrs. Way is now cheered by many signs
of the Spirit's work, and when a hymn of praise to the "Crucified One," is heard from the inner
hall on the ground floor, visitors may be startled to know the voices are those of Hebrew mothers.

Again the Pool of Bethesda is brought to mind, as love for the sick and suffering is shown
in a way hitherto unthought of. In 1875, the Home of Industry became a centre of the now well-known
Bible Flower Mission. One of the much-loved helpers recorded this touching incident:--

"In the early spring of 1874, a snowdrop, primrose, and two or three violets which had been
casually enclosed in a letter from an East-end worker to Mrs. Merry, were passed round her
sewing class of 200 poor old widows, 'for each to have a smell,' and then divided and given
to three dying Christians, one of whom breathed her last fondly clasping them. From that time
flowers were collected through the medium of 'Woman's Work,' etc., and during the season distributed
by the ladies at the Home of Industry among the sick in the neighbouring courts, and in different
hospitals.

"Again the hedges, tipped with tiny coral buds, primroses, and daffodils peeping up amid the
brushwood, golden-eyed celandines and daisies lifting their sweet faces with smiles of welcome,
remind us of the near approach of the bright spring-time. But the heart is saddened, and the
joy of seeing this fresh burst of resurrection-- loveliness is clouded, when we turn to gloomy,
stifling courts and lanes in the crowded cities, where gleams of sunshine scarce ever penetrate;
the lives of whose miserable inhabitants are yet more utterly devoid of brightness; to whom
the voice of spring is an unmeaning sound; to sick ones in these courts, who have no easier
couch for the pain-filled limbs than a heap of shavings on the hard floor of a room filled
with noisy children, and disorderly men and women; to other sufferers tossing feverishly in
hospital wards, with nothing softer for the tired eyes to rest on than the endless stretch
of whitewashed walls, the background of long rows of patients whose sad pale cheeks vie in
whiteness with the sheets and walls: and the cry ascends?

"'Oh, that a tithe of the wealth of fragrant, many-coloured flowers so lavishly spread over
gardens, fields, and hedgerows, could be brought to cheer those who so dearly prize each separate
bloom!'

"And once more down, deeper down, into the haunts of vice, smiling so sweetly with the radiance
of heavensent gifts, these messengers may go--ready-made missionaries--to open doors and hearts
fast locked hitherto, but which must yield to their gentle influence; and thus prepare the
way for the ministry of the word of salvation.

"Oh, that men and women surrounded by loveliness could see as the angels do!--strong natures,
hardened by years of sin, whose stony hearts are melted at sight of the flowers, and weep (as
only such can) when the deep hidden springs are touched, and memory recalls days of childhood's
innocence, long, long past; lessons in that village Sabbath-school of the holy God; the story
of the Son of His love dying in die stead of guilty sinners, to raise them to the bright, pure
land above, where is no sin, no curse, no sorrow, but cloudless day and endless rest and joy;
and the spotless flowers seem to beckon them onwards and upwards, to seek and find the way
thither; for are not the flowers one of the first links in that chain of love which draws the
poor, wearied, sinful heart up to God and heaven?

"Ah! and would to God the country folk might hear! ay, and that the sounds could penetrate
into the halls and castles of our land; the silent cry of hospitals with several hundreds of
patients, and but rarely a flower?

"'I should so like a little buttercup.'

"And the weary murmur of gladness that steals through the wards when a chance bouquet is brought
in; and the heartfelt blessings from many dying lips on the flower-gatherers.

"'Tell them we may never meet on earth, but we shall thank them in heaven.'

"Oh! could the veil be lifted for a brief moment and the dull ears quickened to catch the pleading
accents of the blessed lord? 'Do it unto Me'? none would longer count their flowers and fruit
their own, the Royal seal would be seen on each, whether growing wild in copses, or carefully
nurtured in hothouse and conservatory, and these treasures would be poured out for those so
sadly needing them, 'For Jesus' sake!'"

THE BIBLE FLOWER MISSION.

It is needless to say that the appeal thus made has been answered by thousands of loving hearts.
The work at the Home of Industry is thus carried on:--Twice in the week one of the spacious
floors is devoted to receiving these fragrant treasures, and dear friends from a distance come,
some of them many miles, and spend one or two hours in arranging them, and attaching to each
little cluster an ornamented card with some message of redeeming love. By twelve o'clock the
baskets are generally filled, and all assemble to hear, either from Miss Macpherson or some
other tried servant of the Lord, words of counsel and cheer; and then to seek wisdom for the
labourers, and to spread before the Lord the spiritual needs of those to whom they are going,--many
cases continually occurring for whom the comfort of earnest united prayer is felt.

When the lovely burdens are carried forth, it is hard for the bearers to resist the entreaties
from many a doorstep for "one flower, one single flower." Of the thankfulness with which they
are received when they reach their destination, we might tell countless instances, and of conversions
through the messages they bring we believe not a few. Indeed who can say where the blessing
ends? for those who have found a blessing themselves will not keep the cards under their pillow,
but have sent them to soldier sons in India and China, and to sailors afar off upon the sea.

The following lines were written by a poor woman, aged 70, in the Mile-end Union:--

  "Many an eye with the film of death,
  With fading pulse, and bating breath,
  Have cast a look on those things so bright;
  And perchance a prayer with electric light,
  Has passed through the brain with magic power,
  Brought to the heart by a beautiful flower.
  Beautiful thought to bring to the sad,
  Sweet bright things to make them glad."

Of the numbers of labourers and abundance of texts and flowers required, some idea may be formed
when it is mentioned that thirteen Hospitals, four Unions, some containing over 1000 inmates,
and one Lunatic Asylum, are provided for from the Home of Industry. Nor is this all. The secretary
supplies Bible women and city missionaries with flowers for solitary sick ones at home, and
receives constant appeals from various, missions for these bright messengers of God's love.

Who can read the following without praise to the Giver of every good and perfect gift? Those
who knew the condition of Spain had earnestly prayed for evangelists for that dark land. One
(Senor Previ) was raised up through the instrumentality of the Bible Flower Mission, and the
following extract, from the report of a workers' meeting, as given in the "Christian," tells
of his conversion, and the way in which the Lord led a fellow-labourer to join him in this
almost untrodden path.

"He came from Malaga in the summer of 1875 to the Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields, for treatment.
One afternoon, two ladies belonging to the 'Bible Flower Mission' at the Home of Industry,
brought flowers and texts to give to the patients. One of the visitors was about to offer a
bouquet to the Spaniard, Senor Previ, when the nurse remarked, 'It's of no use giving him a
text, for he is a Roman Catholic, and besides he can't speak a word of English.' 'Never mind,'
was the reply, 'I will offer him a bunch of flowers, and then see what I can do.' But what
about a text? Surely it was the Lord's doing that for the first time she had brought one written
in French; and it was indeed appropriate? This he refused to do, saying, 'No, I cannot, for
it is a bad, forbidden book; besides, I shall leave the hospital to-morrow morning.' 'Nevertheless,
I will send you a copy,' was the answer. With great difficulty the lady procured a second-hand
Spanish Bible, and sent it off just in time for him to take away.

"Senor Previ then told us how, after studying that Bible for several months, the eyes of his
soul were opened to see Jesus as the 'one Mediator.' Thus was fulfilled that promise so precious
to all seed-sowers? 'My Word shall not return unto Me void.'

"Soon afterwards he entered Mr. Guinness's College, employing his free time in distributing
Gospels, &c., on board foreign ships, and assisting every Sunday at the services in the Spanish
Chapel, thus gaining experience for future work in the vineyard. He spoke most warmly of the
kindness of Miss Macpherson, and the happy hours spent in the 'dear Home of Industry,' where,
at a previous workers' meeting, the ardent desire had first been kindled in his heart to tell
the good news of Jesus, the 'one Mediator,' to his own countrymen. For some time he prayed
earnestly that the Lord would raise up a friend to go with him. This petition has been fully
answered.

"Mr. Lund then rose, and told us that whence, student in Stockholm the desire to work in Spain
had been laid on his heart for nearly four years. He studied the language, but, seeing no opening,
was on the point of starting for America, when he received a letter from Mr. Guinness which
entirely altered his plans. He came to London, and on meeting Senor Previ, offered to accompany
him to Spain. The two brethren earnestly requested the prayers of the meeting for their new
and difficult work."

The prayers here offered were more than answered. The first labourer has fallen in the field,
but others have filled the ranks, and the light kindled in a dark place is now shining brightly.

Miss Macpherson's own words here follow:--

"What is the cry from all ends of the earth? For men and women to witness of a Saviour's love
by His death and resurrection. And we are not only to pray the Lord to send forth labourers
into the fields that are white, but to look at the things we oft call our own as belonging
to another. There are hundreds of young men and women who have been brought to the truth, and
whose souls long to be free for Christ's service, but they need a helping hand in little things.

"Let us pray that, from this mission, there may be many results such as the following letter
shows. Six years ago the writer was the first-fruits after a winter's labour in the Bedford
Institute, Spitalfields --a wild, musical Shoreditch youth. We offered to teach him to write.
The Lord changed him, and he has ever since been a consistent Christian. He has been the means
of leading his mother to the Saviour. He went to Canada, earning sufficient money to place
himself this winter at Oberlin College. I was asked if I knew of one suited to become an artizan-missionary
among the tribe of the Basutos. His reply encourages our faith that many more, led thus simply
on, may soon go forth as working missionaries, after the pattern of St Paul, reaching souls
by their simple, holy life, as well as by their preaching."

"OBERLIN COLLEGE, OHIO, March 25, 1873.

"My DEAR MOTHER IN THE LORD,--Your welcome letter to hand on the 22nd, and the book on the
Basutos on the 24th. My soul doth bless the Lord for all that He hath done for me. My soul
was filled with praise when I read your proposition to go to Africa. I had been bound in spirit
for you, as you for me, and I had been asking the Lord for many days that He would incline
you to write to me.

"Previous to receiving the same, I had cast myself upon the Lord more than ever. I could not
see my way to run in debt, and I was wondering whether I should go and work on the road; but
I had a burning desire to labour most of all for Christ, and I was longing to go South, or
somewhere to tell the heathen of Jesus. But when I received your letter, I took it as an answer
to prayer from the Lord, and I could hardly finish reading it before I was telling my landlady
to rejoice with me. How blessed to trace the hand of the Lord in this! I have learned by this
to praise the Lord for what He has done, and it has enabled my soul to trust Him for what He
has promised.

"Believing this call is of God, and after much prayer, I have laid myself, all that I am or
hope to be, upon the altar, for Africa, to labour to lead souls to the Lamb of God, to the
blessed Lord Jesus. I expect to be consumed by the power of the Holy Ghost, to be fitted through
Him for the work I am called to, to be used as the ram's horn, to be spoken through, to lead
souls to Jesus, not to receive the praise of men, but of God.

"And I feel led to say, if it is for anything save for the glory of God that I accept this
call, to be used to the salvation of souls, may the Lord take me home to Himself on sea or
on land, that I see you not in the flesh but in glory.

"I have written this in prayer before God to you, and this is my burning desire, to be used
of God. I do pray the Lord to keep me, and put down all vain-glorying thoughts, which will
naturally rise at such a point as this, and He is doing it. I want to see Jesus more, the value
of precious souls, and all the realities I profess.

"I have read 'The Rides in the Mission Field of South Africa.' I was much interested, and I
had a longing to go, but I could see no place for such a hope; I hare lent it to others here
to read.

"I am reading 'The Basutos,' and I enjoy it; I am reading in prayer that the Lord will show
me what things would be necessary to take. I shall speak on this point presently.

"I had a letter lately from some of my old neighbours in Muskoka, telling me of the conversion
of a young man I had often spoken to and prayed for. I rejoice that my mother has given me
up joyfully for Africa, and I am so glad she continues bright in the Lord. I am praying that
I may have the privilege of seeing them all brought to Christ, before I leave for Africa, I
cease not to pray for you.--Your son in the faith, G. C."

Interest in the Basuto tribe could not but be deepened from the touching incident that in February
of this year a feast for the little matchbox-makers was provided from the contributions of
Basuto children,--those who had been blessed through the Lord's long-tried labourers, Mr. and
Mrs. Dyke. How little could any one then anticipate the deep waters through which those servants
of the Lord have since been called to pass.

The workers' meetings at the Home of Industry are often a time of mingled joy and sorrow. It
is not alone the little emigrants for Canada who are sent forth, but many a brother and sister
in the Lord, leaving home and kindred for His dear name's sake, have here been commended with
tearful prayers to His gracious keeping. The workers' meeting in July this year was a season
of peculiar interest, as George Clarke, the first-fruits of the work, was present on the eve
of his departure for China. The way had not been made open for him to join the mission in South
Africa, as he had desired, and since his departure at this time for China, he has laboured
in connection with the China Inland Mission, not once revisiting his native land.

A few incidents in home work are here recorded:--

"Having asked the Lord to send those He would have rescued for Him, no less than five children
came to the Refuge last Wednesday. Their touching histories need no comment.

"A struggling mother desires a start in life for her boy of ten, whose stepfather subjects
him to ill-treatment. The lady interested in him (for the woman attends her mothers' meeting)
writes: 'William would be saved from destruction, to which he is fast hastening from unkind
treatment.'

"Arthur's story is summed up in his own words: 'I saw my father kill my mother; he stamped
on her when he was drunk, and killed her, and I cried out.' Then, turning to his new friend
and protectress, the little fellow went on: 'But when I get a big man I'll work for you, and
pay you back for taking care of me when I was a little boy.'

"The next group, clad in deep mourning, is brought by a professional opera singer: a babe in
arms, a boy and girl aged two and four, evidently born in a much higher sphere--pretty, refined
children. At their mother's death this young woman took charge of them, their father having
promised to pay 1 pound a week for their support;--an empty promise it proved, for the 'gentleman'
absconded, heavily in debt to many others. The children's friend can no longer afford to keep
them, though she seems tenderly attached to them, and will not part with the baby as long as
she can maintain it. The only way open to her was to let the children wander on the street,
on the chance of their being taken up by the police and put in the workhouse, at the same time
risking her own imprisonment if discovered. Mercifully she heard of the Refuge, and came to
beg a home for these deserted lambs.

"A widowed mother, whose failing eyesight prevents her sewing, and whose earnings by charing
cannot support herself and four children, heard Miss Macpherson speak at the Moorgate Street
Hall Noon Prayer-Meeting, and was led to bring little Alice to her, pleading for Christian
care. Amid many tears she tells of the wayward wilfulness of the elder girl, out at all hours
of day and night, and whose pernicious example is too likely to ruin the little sisters."

Could such cases be sent away, or a deaf ear turned to the cry of these "young children asking
bread, and no man giving it them?" (Lam. iv. 4.)

Miss Macpherson also writes:--"Many of those, once the little match-box makers, are now Christian
girls taking our counsel and going as servants into Christian families.

"Thus our child-loving hearts cannot refuse to rescue the sorrowful children that come to us
to escape the atrocities of the almost unacknowledged bloodless war that goes on in our midst.
Most of the fifty rescues now under our care are here through the slain upon the battle-field
of drink, shaven heads telling the tale of neglect. The last two motherless little girls sent
to us were turned out by their drunken stepfather.

"The leader of our class for mothers and widows says that it is almost impossible to visit
them, their unmurmuring sufferings are so touching. In many of their little garrets almost
everything is sold. And these are the saints of the Lord--those who will very soon go in to
the King more than conquerors. Yes, these are they from whom we learn our best lessons of trust
and patience, how to deal with sceptics, and how to go down and share our crust with a suffering
sister."

"Oh, friends, listen to a mother's sad words. 'Some days nothing all day. A little relief comes
with the parish allowance; but many a morning those hungry voices ask? Mother, is this the
day for bread?' Hear in fancy your loved and cherished little ones asking this, and you will
feel for that mother's heart. She recalls one day that she left them crying for bread; but
she left One with them, the children's Friend. He quieted them; and when after two hours the
mother returned, she found them sleeping. 'But, oh,' she said, 'that sight just broke-my heart,
so starved they looked-- even the baby in Lizzie's arms--all just like little skeletons! I
couldn't help it; I just sat down and wept.' Only with tears could we hear such a tale. No
other response would come as we took in the picture; and it did not mend our sorrow when she
added, 'There were thousands such as these.'" Oh, the intense longing that her voice could
reach to those drawing-rooms yonder! Will not the echo of it, coming in this form, cause some,
not in imagination merely, but in reality, to "come and see?" Climb the dark stair, and hear
for yourself these melting stories, which will fill your heart with pity, and not leave you
wondering what will interest next. What a privilege, yea, high honour, it is to be allowed
to take messages for Jesus! It was stated lately in a crowded gathering of six thousand, as
the misery of the poor was dwelt on, that if God were to ask the angels in heaven if any were
willing to spend fifty or a hundred years down here to befriend some? little shoeless, homeless
boy, for whom no Christian was caring, to tell him of Jesus, and lead him to heaven, 'why,
in three minutes,' were the burning words, 'I don't believe there'd be an angel left within
the pearly gates.'"

"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." That which is called the day of rest, is at the Home
of Industry one of varied and incessant labour; one day may serve as a specimen. Before the
usual hour for morning service, two of the lady-workers start for the Fenchurch Street Station,
to hold a Bible-class with the railway porters; others at the same time leave for Bird Fair.
Bird Fair would he a sad sight to witness on any day in any place, how humiliating it is to
behold on that which is called the Lord's Day in a so-called Christian land. Here, from eleven
till one, dog-stealers parade their ill-gotten prey, and crowds through which it is scarcely
possible to make one's way, are occupied in gambling and betting on them, and on the beautiful
pigeons here made such an instrument of sin. The character of the neighbourhood may be, known
from the appeal made by two poor boys who came on a week day to ask shelter from a blind, Christian
woman. They were locked out of their own home (a bird and rabbit shop), for their parents were
both out drinking, and they said, "Father and mother keep sober only on Sundays, because there
is more business to be done." There, amid many interruptions, the Gospel is preached to those
who would never hear it elsewhere. The preaching station on this occasion was in a railway-arch,
here the harmonium was placed, and two brethren, who came purposely from a distance, gave the
help so much needed; for the strain is great on head, heart, and voice. In the afternoon the
spacious floor, well known to many who attend the workers' meetings, is filled by adult classes
of women. At the close an address is given, often by a returned missionary, and many among
these very poor of the flock bring their offerings, scanty in themselves, but surely much prized
in the sight of Him whose love has constrained them; twice over has a precious offering been
given to me for the Punrooty Mission--once from the adult classes, and again from the younger
Sunday scholars. The adult Sunday-school numbers more than 160 members. A class of working
men is held below. The tea hour is one of peculiar interest. Many young men who are engaged
in business in the week, and give this day of rest to the business of their King, meet here
after having spent the afternoon teaching in various schools. During this meal letters are
read from far-off lands, often written by those who had formerly met here, and who have gone
from this training to dark places of the earth. Many subjects for prayer are thus brought forward
and remembered before the Lord; then the building is again filled to overflowing. An infant
class of ninety in one room on the ground floor--when these disperse a Gospel meeting is held
in this room,--a class of factory girls in another, while above crowds of children press. But
there is much outside work besides, to occupy every helper. Lodging-houses in the thieves'
quarters are visited, and services held, and many hundreds are thus reached; and after nine
P.M., when the labourers return from their varied spheres, all join once more in praise and
prayer, and many walk a long mile and more to reach their own homes, none using any vehicle
or train oh the Lord's day.

It is impossible to follow every detail in this continually increasing work, and only brief
mention can be made of the goodness of the Lord in having once more preserved the lives of
dear ones in Canada, when, in 1875, the Home at Belleville was again destroyed by fire, and
again Canadian kindness and hospitality were manifested to the utmost. Each summer's sun had
shone upon band after band of young emigrants guided safely across the ocean, through the goodness
and mercy of Him, "Who carries the lambs in His bosom," and "Who holdeth the waters in the
hollow of His hand." In the labour of watching over these little ones on the voyage, as in
every other, the Lord raised up helpers like-minded with those who bore the burden of the work.
In May, 1876, the twenty-second party sailed under the care of Mr. Merry and Miss Macpherson,
and the following extracts are from her diary:--

"Friday, May 5.--Calm seas, children bright and happy, cloudless skies, weather charming and
exhilarating, though cold. Morning spent over our Bibles. Time seemed to fly rapidly while
we talked of 'the things concerning the King.' In the afternoon the bracing air and bright
skies invited vigorous exercise, and our Birmingham friend and I walked between two and three
miles. Faith was our theme of converse. May the result be that we both shall trust our God
more than heretofore, for ourselves and our work, and realise increased measure. (Phil. iv.
19) 'My God shall supply all your need.'

"Our children being on deck, we joined them in their games, and then assembled our large family
in their separate steerages; and standing in the doorway between, I was enabled to address
them and the helpers --140 in all. Their evening hymn attracted the sailors, and this gave
a double gathering on mid-decks. Our portion was Luke x. 38-42, 'The one thing needful.' Jesus
the need of each one, ere leaving us. A saddened look fell over every little face, as we referred
to parting, while many beamed with joy, as we talked of the meeting by and bye. We closed by
singing 'Around the throne of God in heaven.' During this hour Mr. Merry held a solemn meeting
among the sailors in the forecastle. May the Lord Jesus scatter His saints to the four quarters
of the globe, that His glory may be increased. If those who cannot go would only meet weekly,
in twos and threes, and pray for the foreign fields of perishing millions, surely we should
see greater results.

"This day ended in one of the most lovely of moonlight nights, and as we walked on deck we
were ever and anon led to praise God and admire the beauties of His hand. Venus was resplendent;
very large and full of soft lustrous beauty, while an aurora shed some lovely tinges of colour
across the sky. Our little group turned once more towards the chart room, and sang a hymn of
praise to 'Him who hath loved us.'

  "'If so much loveliness is sent
  To grace our earthly home,
  How beautiful, how beautiful
  Must be the world to come!'

"Saturday, May 6.--At early dawn we were awakened from a long brain-refreshing sleep by one
of the officers gently tapping at our door, and in a whisper saying, 'A glorious sunrise.'
We were soon with him on the bridge, filled with admiration as we gazed upon the scene before
us. The sun appeared rising from the ocean, its golden rays shedding a dazzling brilliance
on all around. While we watched, the scene changed, and a misty veil beclouded the whole horizon,
hiding from our view that which had been so lovely.

"After going down to an early cup of tea we sang our morning hymn of praise, and had a season
of prayer; a very hallowed opportunity it was, one which brought us again to feel our deep
need of grace, to live one more day to His praise and glory.

"About noon we bad another of those never-ending changes which are to be met with on this great
ocean; the sun came out bright and warm, the sky became brilliantly blue, and the sea was one
sheet of ice fields as far as the eye could reach.

"Our noble Scotch ironclad rode on her way majestically, leaving a pathway in the frozen fields
to be seen for miles behind, and as she struck her boom upon the massive sheets of ice, they
seemed to vibrate and cause a movement in huge sheets on before and on either side. Some magnificent
pieces, when touched by the ironclad's power, shiver into thousands of fragments, others pass
our vessel's side, hard as iron, to be wafted on to the Gulf Stream, there to come under a
warmer influence. This Arctic scene causes our captain and his officers to look rather serious,
and they mount at times to the fore-topgallant mast. Did we but know the dangers which beset
us through yielding to the allurements of the world, how often would we also mount aloft, and
get upon, our watch-tower and look out!

"You will naturally ask, How far did the ice reach? We were fourteen hours cutting through
it, passing sixty vessels and two steamers (many of them fixtures), signalling those we came
near. It was touching to see a barque make efforts to get into our opened-up pathway, but she
could not make the short distance to reach the cleared waters. Those who watched throughout
that long day as we triumphantly, though slowly, broke our ice-girt way, saw seals between
the fields of ice, porpoises and whales spouting and bounding in their glorious freedom, sea-gulls
and small red birds flying about.

"Our little fellows were constructing allegories after the fashion of their last course of
lessons on Banyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The ice field, they said, was like Satan, and the
ship was like Christian; and thus they went on, as they sat looking over the bulwarks at the
ice which so hindered our progress. There is not a child who has not had his constitution braced
by this most favourable voyage. To-day we passed a steamer in the ice, which had started a
week ahead of us from Glasgow. How we realised at this time the comfort and rest of having
a captain and officers who were men of prayer.

"The gun was now fired to tell the dwellers at Metis to telegraph the glad news to you that
we were safe in sight of land, though there are still Amaleks to be overcome,--narrow straits
lined with mountains full of minerals, which are a magnetic attraction to our ironclads, and
more ships have been lost here than anywhere else; fogs which come and go, ever keeping the
sailor as he nears the shore in anxious trepidation; and shallows that require skill in sounding.

"Sunday, May 7.--A cloudy day, after a week of unspeakable loving-kindness and tender mercy.
We could by faith hear His own voice within, saying 'My peace I give unto you.' Our children
all day were most obedient, and kind and loving to each other. We spent the morning together,
the last of the kind until we meet on that morning that hath no clouds. Ere commencing our
lesson, we asked a sailor to lift the hatchway wide open. This gave the suggestion for the
subject, 'The Man with the Palsy,' which was easily understood by supposing the sailors with
cords to let one more little boy down into our midst.

"The pilot met us at Father Point about 4 P.M., bringing a telegram of welcome from one of
our dear Canadian friends, also a verse from Philemon. Thus we feel assured loving hearts are
prayerfully awaiting us on the shores we are nearing, a sweet symbol of the better land and
the loved ones on before.

"Monday, May 8.--Mr. Merry was astir before five o'clock, and awaking the young helpers. Soon
they were in the steerage among the children; commenced packing of blankets, &c., as we were
expecting to make the port soon after breakfast In this, however, we were disappointed, as
in Travers's Strait the Mineral Mountains attracted the compass, and a dense fog hiding all
headlands retarded our progress, making it necessary to lower one of the boats to take the
soundings, and go before the great 'Sardinian,' showing her how to shape her course in the
narrow way. A sweet reminder this to us that our Lord was so condescending as to use the possessions
of a little lad when He needed the two small fishes. And we take encouragement that many of
our little ones are going on before, preparing the way in many a district by their sweet hymns
telling of the 'wondrous story,' for the devoted evangelists who are being raised up in Canada
to follow with deeper revealings of the blessed Bible, winning precious souls 'till He come.'

  "'I am coming! Are you working?
    Short your serving time will be;
  Are your talents idle lying?
    Are you using them for me?'

"Such is the effect of fog at sea, that we are told it may be 6 P.M. ere we arrive, and judging
from all appearances, great caution is required in the Gulf at this time of year. At 11 A.M.
we had a sweet season of thanksgiving for the many mercies received. At twelve o'clock the
fog lifted, and the engine went on with its accustomed vigour. At 5 P.M. we neared the shore,
and there stood a group of more than a dozen young ladies, waving a welcome. Soon they were
on deck, and saluted us and our children, telling us they had borne us up in prayer before
the Lord. After uniting with them in praise for the unspeakable mercies by the way, we bade
farewell to passengers, officers, and crew, and sliding down the long gangway from the I bulwarks,
felt our feet once more on terra firma. Shaking our captain's hand with a grateful heart for
all his kindness to us and ours, in a few minutes steam was up, and the 'Sardinian' on her
way to Montreal.

"We then went to see the little ones having tea in an adjoining hall, while Mr. Merry was very
busy among the agents and luggage. It being announced that the Quebec boat was ready to cross
the river, we had to part with our young friends, who told us they should all take a deeper
interest than ever in us now they had seen the bright faces Of our children. Front love to
Jesus, they had met during the past winter to make clothing, and presented me with a large
case to take on.

"After sending our telegrams to each Home, we found the first-class cars ready for our children,
so we put every one at full length, and soon all were soundly asleep, and we went on hour after
hour.

"Tuesday, May 9.--We arrived at Montreal at ten o'clock, where a most comfortable breakfast
was awaiting us, with nice washing accommodation. Here we had the pleasure of meeting the Secretary
of the Emigration Department of Ottawa, who kindly gave us some sound counsel on many points
bearing upon our work of emigration.

"At eleven o'clock we heard the summons, 'All aboard!' and were soon again on our way. We dined
at Prescott, and then still westward we travelled until midnight.

"All was mercy. For Sidney, our little delicate child, we feared the cold night-air would be
too much, so the cry went upwards for guidance with regard to this precious orphan, whose story
was so touching. A Christian widow had sheltered his mother from the streets when the child
was but two weeks old, and had kept him for five years, but now, her failing eyesight rendering
her unable to support him, with a breaking heart she gave him up to us. All my desire now our
journey was ending was to keep from making one special attachment, yet his delicacy drew us
all more than ever to him.

"Owing to a telegram not having been delivered, about midnight one of the trying incidents
of this part of our journey unexpectedly occurred. On arriving at Belleville, after awaking
our sleeping family, we found neither friend nor conveyance awaiting us. Mr. Merry walked the
mile to the Home, and soon our waggon was ready to take back a few of the most exhausted ones,
whilst our car was shunted to a siding for the night.

"Wednesday, May 10.--Ere seven o'clock, by help of a large omnibus, we were conveyed to the
new Belleville Home, where we met with a warm welcome. It was a day of reunion with loved fellow-workers,
talking of the way the Lord had led us, and the trials and joys of the past year. Twelve months
ago, I left this Home a mass of ruins and burnt embers; now a new and more efficient one for
the purpose is erected on the same spot My beloved friend Miss Bilbrough has indeed had many
a burden to bear, but her testimony to the Lord's faithfulness is greater than ever. Her heart
is more and more devoted to the children, and to carrying forward the work in all its never-ceasing
details.

"After a few hours' sleep, it was so very interesting to walk over our new and conveniently
arranged Home. Truly our hearts were filled with praise as we knelt together to thank the Lord.
Towards the afternoon I was introduced to a young man who was working as gardener. We had brought
him out from England in 1870, and he has ever since given great satisfaction to his employers,
has paid back his passage-money, joined the Church, and not long since was married to his late
master's daughter.

"In the evening we walked into town, and met with 'Daniel's Band,' which is composed of seventeen
Christian young men, who are uniting in prayer and work for the souls of their fellow-townsmen;
and through their instrumentality many conversions have taken place, and the churches have
been stirred up to greater activity. Mr. Merry gave a clear Gospel address, and another meeting
being asked for, a Bible-reading was arranged for the following evening. Thus we had the privilege
of witnessing for our blessed Master to about 200, and cheering the hearts of 'Daniel's Band.'

"Thursday, May 11.--Occupied the day writing English letters and receiving friends. Also went
to see an aged saint, who had from our first visit to these shores been a helper by her prayers.

"Friday, May 12.--Left Belleville for Galt soon after 6 A.M., taking with us thirty-eight children,
and travelling by rail along the shores of Lake Ontario. The morning hours passed quickly en
route, and as we neared Toronto, towns and villages became more frequent and more attractive.
At Berlin an unexpected kindness was shown us. Orders had been given to send us on by special
train, so that no delay was experienced in travelling the remaining fourteen miles of our journey.
Those who have travelled 3000 miles with a number of children can understand how this was appreciated
by us, when every nerve was strained, and nature was yearning for a long sleep free from the
shaking of the railway.

"At 5 P.M., on the seventeenth day after leaving London, we reached the end of our journey,
and found our farmer-nephew, with his team, awaiting our arrival. Soon we were on the hill,
looking at the little Home beyond. As we approached the gates the shout of welcome from more
than a score of young voices greeted us, and on the verandah we were received by our loved
niece, and the dear friends who have been assisting her in the absence of her parents. The
strain of travel now being over, we were able to enjoy a few hours' rest, our hearts full of
gratitude for the many mercies which had encompassed us all our journey through.

  "'How good is the God we adore,
    Our faithful, unchangeable Friend
  Whose love is as great as His power,
    And knows neither measure nor end.'"

During the winter, individual visitation of the children had been most effectually accomplished
by the four Inspectors appointed by the Canadian Government, the result of which proved to
be most favourable to the plan of placing the "Solitary in families." After two days rest at
Galt, Miss Macpherson started on the same loved work, and met with the usual cheering results.

On her return home Miss Macpherson thus writes:--

"July 20.

"In the providence of our covenant-keeping God, and Father of the fatherless, we have been
again permitted in peace to return from another visit to the adopted homes of our little ones.
To His praise, who is the Answerer of prayer, we record that 100,000 miles have been travelled
in connection with these special charges in the past six years, and no storm or accident has
been permitted to alarm, no death requiring the remains to be committed to the great deep.

"During the past year the Dominion Government chose four of their oldest officials to visit
all our children, (as their Blue-book records), 'deeming that from their experience they would
be best enabled to judge of the condition, position, and prospects of the children in their
situations.' The Government are satisfied (as parents of the State), that our children 'are
very carefully placed,' bringing out the fact that, ninety-eight out of every 100 are doing
well." Miss Macpherson adds:--

"A letter will often show the progress of an industrious young man, and being asked for details,
I give the following from a handful of similar encouraging testimonials:--

"MAGNETAWAN, DISTRICT PARRY SOUND, ONTARIO.

"DEAR MISS MACPHERSON,--This is from William Miller--one that came cut under your care three
years ago last June. I worked in the town of Galt as a substitute three months, for a man while
he went home to his friends in Scotland. After that I went to live in Pelham, in the county
of Welland, a situation that Miss Reavell directed me to, and there stayed three years, and
saved a little money; and now I have moved to Parry Sound, to the address which you will find
at the end of this note. Dear friend, I desire to hear of your welfare in the work that God
has put in your hands to do,--in bringing out the destitute ones from England into a land of
plenty, and where they can be well cared for. I have seen many of them around the country where
I have been, almost all looking well, and enjoying themselves much.

"I now live in the township of Croft. I have 186 acres of land, on the banks of Doe Lake. I
think if I had stayed in England I should not have had as many feet. I like England very well,
but it is a hard place for the poor. I took 100 acres of this land as free grant, and the rest
I bought. It is two miles and a half from the village. There are two stores, post-office, and
sawmill; I think a flour-mill will be built this summer. Magnetawan River runs through the
village. There are two waterfalls for mill purposes in the village. A day school will commence
in the summer, and there is also a church and Sunday-school, to which I go. In the winter it
is not held, because the roads are so bad, but when the country gets open more the roads will
be better.

"I humbly thank God for guiding and keeping me in good health, and under the banner of Christ,
and I trust walking in His ways, and hope to remain so unto death, and then live with Him above,
there to part no more.

"My brother is living here also; he has 200 acres of land. Remember me to all the workers at
the Home, praying that we may all, as Christians, work for the Lord of glory, and at last meet
together to praise Him. 'Wait on the Lord.'

"I remain, yours truly in Christ, W. MILLER."

Those who have been helped, help their kindred in after years. The following is an instance:--

"DOUGLAS, June 29, 1876.

"DEAR Miss MACPHERSON,--I have been here four years in August, I will be four years with my
master in October. I like this country well; the crops are growing well, and there is prospect
of a good harvest. Dear ma'am, I have a little brother nearly ten years old, and he is living
with my mother; he wants to come to this country, and mother is willing he should, and I think
I have enough to pay his passage out; and if it pleased you, would you take him into your Home,
and send him out with your boys. Please would you send him to the Belleville Home, as we would
then be able to get him, because the man that my brother is with says he would not object to
taking him. Please would you let me know how much it would take to pay for sending him to Belleville,
and where would I send the money to.

"I am able to plough now, and milk cows, chop wood, reap grain, and mow hay. I am raising fifty
young apple-trees of the Spitenberg kind. I am going to be a farmer myself some day; it is
very nice and healthy work. I get a good many rides on horseback. I have a lamb of my own;
my master gave it me when it was a small, little lamb, but now it has grown into a good-sized
sheep. The Premier of the Dominion was at this village, and I heard him speak. We will soon
begin to cut our hay; we have a mowing-machine, so that it does not take long to cut our hay.
There is a Sunday-school three miles away from us, quite near where my brother lives; it has
sixty scholars, and I go to it every Sunday, but the preaching is only once a fortnight. In
our Sunday-school we sing about the same hymns we used to sing when in the Refuge, and there
is three of us 'Home' boys go to that Sunday-school. We have seven head of horn-cattle, five
horses, ten sheep, and six lambs, thirty-six hens, forty-four hen chickens, two geese, and
nine goslings, two pigs, and one calf, so I will say good-bye for the present.--I remain, yours
sincerely,

JOHN HENEY MITCHELL.

"P.S.--Give my love to all the boys, and accept the, same from me, J. M."

The following incidents are told by Miss Macpherson:--

"Miss Bilbrough often goes off with half-a-dozen to see them placed in their new home. Whilst
on one of these journeys, the little ones were attracting the notice of fellow-travellers,
as some forty to fifty are generally in a compartment. From amongst these Miss Bilbrough is
accosted by a young gentleman, who lifts his hat to her, and sits down by her side. This was
one of our first party, now a young solicitor, just about to pass his last examination. He
was on the important business of going to some place in the backwoods to value a farm for the
firm by whom he was employed.

"Another young man, one of our second band in 1870, is now visiting his friends in England
for a month, ere beginning his career as a lawyer in Canada; and more than this, he is, we
rejoice to say, a consistent Christian of several years' standing. Now, when we want a lawyer's
counsel, our young friend is glad to give it us, and already has done us good service. Sweet
thank-offerings!

"My past birthday in June was spent in taking two little fellows to their homes. After travelling
nearly one hundred miles, as we neared our destination very tired, we wondered to ourselves
whether it would be in a log hut, farmhouse, or mansion we should find a welcome with our little
charges. It proved to be the last.

"The Lord had put it into the heart of a young married lady to rear an orphan boy, and thus
fulfil a long-cherished idea. She had also induced another Christian lady to do the same. It
was a sweet reward to His wearied servant, to know that two orphans would be so well cared for."

"They helped every one his neighbour, and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage"
(margin, be strong). Miss Macpherson writes in February this year, the eighth anniversary:--

"As a band, we need to 'be strong' for any emergency. At this season we are surrounded by hundreds
of men out of employment, and in want of food, who say now to us--'We have listened to your
Gospel; we are in want; show us thy faith by thy works.' This we are endeavouring to do by
providing for them suppers of soup and bread twice a week. The other evening a crowd had gathered
outside the door at the specified hour, when only 150 could be admitted. Did we but know the
gnawings of real hunger we should not wonder that the unsuccessful applicants attempted to
burst in; and one poor man falling in the crush, broke his arm.

"We need your prayers while dealing with this class for another month. Strong hearts quail
at the sight of these hopeless looking men. Our evening-school three times a week, taught by
ladies, we find to be the most successful plan of dealing with them. The being called by their
own names, man by man, wakes up an interest, and causes the public-house life to go into the shade.

"The friends of the match box-makers (our oldest love in this vineyard) will rejoice to hear
that we gathered 300 of them straight from their boxes to a New Year's tea, when a kind friend
helped to make the evening a pleasant one by exhibiting dissolving views. After this the gifts
of clothing, &c., with which we had been supplied by many contributors, were distributed among
them.

"Last week we had a very happy evening with our Christian band, many of whom were the matchbox-makers
of former days, now grown, into young women, and fellow-workers for Christ in their own homes,
and in the courts and alleys where they dwell. Deeply interesting were their testimonies of
answers to prayer, the power of the Word, and delivering grace in time of trial in the factories
where they labour. Dear helpers by prayer, you now behold what great things the Lord hath wrought
for us in giving us this band of young women to go forth on the Sunday afternoons in couples
with their tracts, and reach many whom perhaps we might not find. Some of these are also teachers
in our Sunday-school, sympathising with us in our East-end trials, teaching to others what
they have learned of Jesus through their own experience of His great love.

"The 'elder girls' of the East-end are a continual heavy burden on our heart; much thought
and care are being bestowed in devising and perfecting plans for winning their young lives
to the Saviour, and fitting them for honourable service for God and man. This great preventive
work among those young bread-winners can only be successfully accomplished by those who, through
studying their habits, temptations, and surroundings, by constant loving contact with them,
and by special training, are able to win their confidence and affection."

In this year a new and most important work was begun, one which has eminently received the
blessing of "Him who is the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of those who are afar
off upon the sea."

Miss Child, one like-minded with Miss Macpherson inter zeal for souls, and her longing to save
them from the curse of drink; had been residing in the Home of Industry, and visiting public-houses
in Ratcliff Highway. To those who have never seen the open parade of sin in that part, (long
notorious for every, evil), it is hard to describe the scene, where even in broad daylight
the unhappy captives of Satan seem to glory in their shame. Miss Child's heart yearned over
the sailors who crowd the public-houses, escaped from the perils of the sea only to fall into
worse dangers. She longed for some means of helping them. Miss Macpherson appealed to him whose
burning words in the City of London Theatre in 1861 had so stirred her own heart Mr. Reginald
Radcliffe had lately opened a Strangers' Rest in Liverpool, and only longed to see the same
established in every port in the world. In answer to the call, he came up to London and addressed
Christian workers assembled at the Home of Industry, stirring them up to undertake a new form
of attack on the strongholds of the enemy. Mr. James E. Matheson took the deepest interest
in this work, and a house was secured in Ratcliff Highway, the appearance of which was made
to contrast very strongly with all around. Gospel texts in many languages appeared in all the
windows, and invitations to sailors to enter and write their letters, materials provided free
of cost. This work needed many helpers. Preachers were required for the different nationalities.
Such were found, and willing listeners, so that soon a larger house was necessary. Notwithstanding
the many calls on her time and strength, Miss Macpherson was frequently to be found here, delighting
in seeking to save among a class hitherto difficult to reach. Many other sisters in the Lord
were, called on to help--some to play the harmoniums provided in each room, and lead the singing
in varied languages--others in writing letters for those who could not use a pen themselves,
and whose hearts were softened by kindness shown in this way--others in filling, bags with
books and tracts. The blessing which has followed these cannot be reckoned; none can tell what
these silent messengers, so often despised on shore, have been to sailors when read far away
from home and friends. Many of these bags have been made by Christian invalids, and are followed
by their prayers that the contents may ever be blessed.

As yet, however, nothing had been done for the women in Katcliff Highway, and Miss Macpherson,
when visiting that neighbourhood where Satan reigns so openly, longed to save some of her poor
lost sisters. On one occasion a young woman said most piteously to her: "Why don't you speak
to us as you do to the sailors, and we would be converted and be happy too?" This led to the
first decided effort being made, and the following year a small mission room for their use
alone was opened. Tea-meetings and Gospel addresses-were given here. Miss Macpherson's long-tried
helper, Miss May, added this work to her many other burdens for the Lord, and other kind friends
joined her in visiting and seeking out the lost.

Although, in Miss May's words, "humanly speaking all things were against us,"--for in this
neighbourhood the wages of iniquity are high, yet encouragement was met with, and it was felt
that the mission room was not sufficient, but some shelter must be taken wherein to receive'
poor applicants until they could be removed to a safer locality. A tiny three-roomed house
was secured and opened with, much prayer, and has fulfilled the promise of the name given to
it, "The Bridge of Hope." The Lord blessed Miss Macpherson in the choice of a helper, Miss
Underdown, the brave pioneer who volunteered to remain here alone, ready to welcome the poor
wanderer at any hour of the day or night. She is now working among sailors at Cape Town; but
the Lord has proved in this instance, as in many others, that when His summons to a distant
land is obeyed, the work at home will not be suffered to languish. Another devoted sister in
the Lord, Miss Steer, has given up home ties and home comforts, counting it all joy to rescue
those most deeply sunk in guilt and misery. The work has doubled and trebled in importance,
more than a hundred having been drawn out of this whirlpool of sin and infamy, and brought
under the sound of the Gospel within the walls of the larger Refuge, since opened for them.
More than once we have had to praise God for the help given by Christian sailors; their watchful
eyes have noticed in the "Highway" some who were evidently strangers to the haunts of vice,
and have brought them here for safety, and even borne part of the expense of their journey
homewards. The house originally taken for the Strangers' Rest having been found inadequate
for the accommodation of the crowds who frequented it, a larger house was taken, but it was
felt that after the many hallowed associations of the first house opened, where Miss Macpherson
and Miss Child had often rejoiced with the angels of God over repenting sinners, it was impossible
to relinquish it for ordinary uses,--it might be in that neighbourhood for some direct work
of Satan. To Miss Macpherson's great joy her faithful, co-worker, Miss Child, determined on
opening it as a Temperance Coffee House, or "Welcome Home" for the sailors, and thenceforth
made this place her abode, and the work of God has never ceased.

In the spring of this year Miss Macpherson had contemplated starting with a party for Canada,
but as the time drew near she was so much worn out by the continued strain of "holding the
fort" at Spitalfields for the last two years, that some of her friends almost feared she would
be unable to take the charge. She would not suffer her bodily weakness to hinder her, and on
May the 8th started on her twenty-first voyage in the "Sardinian," accompanied by her brother-in-law,
Mr. Merry, with a party of fifty children, and two young men who had gone out with her in 1870,
and had returned to see their friends, and were on their way back with her to the land of their
adoption. So many thousand miles had been traversed by land and sea, and hitherto thanksgivings
had gone up for preservation from even alarm of danger. Now a deeper thanksgiving was to be
called forth, for the Lord's preserving care in a scene which brought all face to face with
eternity. On the Monday before she left Miss Macpherson remarked to some friends, "The Word
is full of Deliverance, both individual deliverance and otherwise," little dreaming how soon
she would be called to realise this truth.

The following letter, which appeared in the "Times," tells of the strength given in time of need:--

"May 14, 1878.

"Captain Grills, of the Liverpool Mercantile Marine Service Association, going to Derry upon
a pleasure trip, was upon the bridge of the 'Sardinian' when the accident occurred, and speaks
in high terms of the discipline of officers and crew under the trying circumstances. He says:--'I
was on the bridge with Captain Dutton, looking for the approach of the tender, when in a moment
an explosion occurred down in the fore-hold, where a quantity of coal was stored, and blew
into the air thousands of fragments of wood. Immediately afterwards people came shrieking up
the companion ways, many, of them cut, bruised, and blackened. The scene was indescribable.
A great deal of confusion was caused by the separation of children from parents and husbands
from wives. One poor woman begged me to go and find her baby, which was torn from her arms.
The Captain, on hearing the explosion and seeing the smoke, sprang from the bridge, ordered
the hose to be instantly applied, and by dint of extraordinary exertions on the part of himself,
the officers, and crew, succeeded in saving several people who were in the midst of the debris.
The hold was flooded with water from the hose, but the smoke continued to pour out in dense
volumes, and ultimately they had to abandon all hope of saving the ship except by opening the
sluices and letting the water in. Before doing this the vessel was taken into five fathoms
of water, so that when she settled down her decks would be above water, and she might the more
easily be pumped out and raised. While these orders were being executed, the whole of the saloon
passengers, assisted by many of the crew, were engaged in transferring the emigrants to the
mail tender which had just come alongside. About 300 or 400 soon crowded her decks, and she
landed them at Moville pier, after which she returned for orders. Subsequently the second tender
took off most of the saloon passengers, many wounded, and a large quantity of baggage. The
boats were lowered in order to save the baggage. The mail tender returned and took the rest
of the people, and I went with them, and we reached Derry about nine o'clock that night. I
cannot refrain from referring to the heroic conduct of one lady, [Footnote: Miss Catherine
Ellis of Tryon House] a saloon passenger, who, while partially dressed, rescued a baby that
was fearfully burnt, at considerable risk to herself; the mother had proceeded to Derry, thinking
she had lost her child for ever. The promptitude and energy displayed by Captain Button was
in every way admirable, and his orders were executed with great decision. Miss Macpherson and
her little band of Canadian emigrants showed no small amount of true fortitude and heroism.
Most of the children behaved nobly under the trying circumstances, and exhibited much of the
fruit of their careful training. They kept repeating to one another many of the sayings they
had heard from Miss Macpherson about being patient, and brave, and good; I visited the infirmary
before leaving on Saturday, and spoke to each of the nine patients, who are all suffering seriously,
but I am hopeful of the recovery of some.'"

Miss Macpherson's own account follows:--

"Sunday morning.

"Since we parted from you and those beloved Christian friends at St. Pancras last Wednesday,
we seem to have lived years, and learnt more of the reality of the delivering power of our

   He hopes the pagan children will be
taught about Jesus. He is so touched by the care taken of these little ones and by the work
of the Christian lady who saves them. The Chief says he is very thankful I brought him here
to-day. The circle on the grass reminds him of how the Indian children sit to sacrifice the
white dog. He is going back to tell the children of his people all these blessed things.'

"During Mr. Needham's interpretation the Chief stood by him, his usually impassive face quite
lit up with animated interest. After a while he played to us on his cornet, his favourite tune
being 'God save the Queen.' Mr. Needham told us a few deeply interesting details of his work
among the Indians, and how the Lord is giving His blessing in conversions, and also in the
temperance work just begun among them. He told us of an Indian mother who would walk eight
miles to hear the Gospel, with one baby slung over her back, in its curious mummy-like cradle,
and another slung on her arm! The poor Indians are beginning really to value the care and labour
bestowed on them by the missionary whom God has so evidently prepared for and led into this
work. And surely such a mission as this has a deep and solemn claim on the help and sympathy
of those who have now possession of the land of the Red Indian, and enjoy the blessings he
has lost. Let the white man, who brought him the 'fire-water,'--dire instrument of death!--seek
now, though, alas! so late, to carry to him with all speed the blessed 'water of life,' that
he may drink and live for ever.

"As the shadows on the grass grew longer, and the west began to glow with the sunset crimson,
the little ones, tired yet happy, were taken home to bed, and our kind friends bade as all
farewell. When we look back on our happy picnic in the Bush, and raise our earnest prayers
for the dear children God has rescued and shall yet rescue, let us not forget to plead for
the mission to the Six Nation Indians, and to ask that the light of the glorious Gospel may
speedily bring hope and gladness to many a poor dark heart."

Miss Macpherson's next letter tells of many varied interests:--

"DEAR FELLOW-WORKERS,--Our proposed three days of Christian fellowship and conference at the
Galt Home are now over. Numbers were not large, the accommodation here being limited, bat several
ministers, evangelists, and devoted brothers and sisters, who have true sympathy in the Master's
work for the deaf children, waited on the Lord with us, and it has proved a time of great spiritual
blessing, preparing us to go forth in the days that remain, strong to labour for our blessed
Lord, just to do His will.

"Leaving matters at Galt going on in their even way, only varied by the occasional return of
children, who, from temper, ill-health, or some other cause, have not been able to remain in
the situations first found for them, (which shows the value of our Homes on this side the Atlantic),
we are again on the wing.

"The Sunday after the conference was spent at Sheffield, a village containing a thousand inhabitants.
On arriving we found the sheds around the church full of conveyances, betokening a good congregation.
The people, looking bright in their white summer costumes, joined with wonderful heartiness
in singing, 'All hail the power of Jesus' name.' Mr. Merry gave a powerful address on Ezek.
xxxvii. 1-10. During the afternoon we learned that a time of revival had sprung from a few
godly women meeting at each other's houses to pray for a blessing on the village. They felt
the need of a definite object for their prayers, and selected a young man who was a great drunkard,
and the disturber of every meeting. Soon they were rejoiced to learn that he was truly converted
to the Lord without any human agency. Now his face is the brightest of the congregation, and
none is more active to win souls than he. On leaving Sheffield we were grateful to know we
had secured many hearts to pray for us and our little ones.

"We took a large case of Testaments to the next place we visited; and an evangelist who had
been labouring for some weeks there, sold for us; on Henry Moorhouse's plan, in the market-place,
600 Testaments, and gave away 7200 Gospel leaflets.

"Since then we have stayed with the friends at St. Catharine's, exchanging words of cheer with
Presbyterian, Episcopal, Methodist, and other brethren. Now we are staying with members of
the Society of Friends at Fonthill. How sweet is this fellowship of saints, 'endeavouring to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace!' Here we learn with joy how our brother-in-law
was used to the conversion of many in the villages around during the past winter. We have been
comparing notes with four of the dear sisters here, contrasting our work at Ratcliff Highway,
with its three mission-houses, our elder girls, widows, and lodging-houses, with theirs among
navvies on Welland Canal, drunkards, and farmers and their wives living away in solitary nooks.
The work is one presenting a full, free, and present salvation by a once crucified and now
risen Lord.

"The dear wife of the Lord's honoured servant, Jonathan Grubb, is giving great joy and help
to the busy workers on this hill-top, by sending large parcels of tracts purchased from the
various societies in England, assorted into packets during her winter hours. From the friends
here they go to many a lone corner of the great continent. The postal charges are so small,
that surely many a sister might share with us in sending a fresh packet now and again to those
who have little reading of any kind; also the many gifts from the Tract Society have been most
valuable in these country places.

"Our children settled in the neighbourhood of Font-hill are growing up into manhood, some of
them becoming earnest Christians.

"Our stay is necessarily brief; distances are great, and strength small; but we ever realise,
'He leadeth us.'

"Dear fellow-workers, let us watch and pray, and labour on, 'till He come.'"

"Till He come!". It is sweet with these words to close this imperfect record of the labours
of the Lord's beloved handmaid; especially when we look back to the time twenty years' before,
when the "blessed hope" was first made the source of new strength and power to her soul. May
not the words of the letter quoted above be adopted with little alteration by every Christian
labourer? Our stay can be but brief,--perhaps not one working hour is yet left to us, and how
emphatically do the words now come to us, "Redeeming the time because the days are evil;" so
evil, that were it not for the sure word of prophecy, we should lie down in despair. If we
looked to present agency to change the scenes of sin and sorrow around us, all hope would vanish.
But we have "a hope that maketh not ashamed," and "that blessed hope" is an "anchor of the
soul" "The work is great," great it has always been, but how much greater now that doors hitherto
closed are open in every part of the world; from every country the cry is, "Come over and help
us." Many a solitary pioneer has fallen, oh! that others might come forth to fill up the ranks.
"Strength is small;" "Without me ye can do nothing;" "Is there not an appointed warfare (margin)
to man upon earth?" He, who has appointed the warfare will not send any at their own charges.
The "blessed hope" strengthens the weak hands and confirms the feeble knees. He will give the
grace, the wisdom, the strength, all that is needed, day by day. "Till He come." Three little
words--no more--but who can tell the comfort, the strength, the sweetness this hope brings
to those who are watching for the coming of their King?

       *       *       *       *       *

The following deeply affecting lines are from the same pen as those before quoted. Miss Geldard,
the gifted writer, was for a time a much valued fellow-labourer both in England and Canada:--

A HOME AND A HEARTY WELCOME.

  All day has the air been busy,
   As the daylight hours went by,
  With the laugh of the children's gladness,
   Or their pitiful, hopeless cry.

  But now all is hushed in silence,
   They are lying in slumber deep:
  While I ask, in this solemn midnight,
   Where do the children sleep?

  We know there are children sleeping
   In many a happy home,
  Where sickness rarely enters,
   Where want may never come.

  Their hands in prayer were folded
   Ere they laid them down to rest,
  And on rosy lip and soft white brow
   Were a mother's kisses pressed.

  They sleep and dream of angels;
   Ah! well may their dreams be fair!--
  Their home is now so like a heaven,
   They seem already there.

  But where are the children sleeping
    In these wretched streets around,
  Where sin, and want, and sorrow
    Their choicest haunt have found?

  Will you climb this broken staircase,
    And glance through this shattered door;
  Oh, can there be children sleeping
    On that filthy and crowded floor?

  Yes! old and young together,
    A restless, moaning heap;
  O God! while they thus are sleeping,
    How dare Thy children sleep?

  Does the night air make you shiver,
    As the stream sweeps coldly by?
  (Cold as the hearts of the heedless),
    Here, too, do the children lie.

  An archway their only shelter;
    The pavement their nightly bed;
  Thou, too, when on earth, dear Saviour,
    Hadst nowhere to lay Thy head.

men richer.

4. "Among the hundreds are there not some failures, some exceptions? What becomes of them?"

Yes, there are disappointments and failures in this work as well as in every other. We do not
take little angels to Canada, but very human little boys and girls with every variety of temper
and character, and sometimes hereditary disadvantages which it is hard to battle with. But
patient forbearance and gentle treatment and time do so much for them. And often a kind farmer
has asked to be allowed to keep, and "try again" the wilful little fellow who has tried to
run away or proved tiresome to manage.

"Ninety-eight per cent, of our children do well, and for the two per cent, we do the best we
can. If any circumstance arises making it desirable for a farmer to give up a boy, he is at
once returned to the Home, where he is received and kept until another more suitable place
is found for him."

Should any be still blinded to the blessings of emigration for the young, surely their eyes
will be opened on reading the following facts as related by Miss Macpherson:--

"William and Mary were brother and sister living in a terrible warren near Drury Lane. The
boy's employment was to gather rags and bones. Their parents had been buried by the workhouse.
Their condition was too deplorable to be described. A year's training was not lost upon this
sister and brother. They came to Canada in 1873. Now, could yon see them at nineteen and twenty-two--able
to read and write, well-clothed with their own honest earnings, having saved, in 1877, one
hundred dollars; and this year, 1879, William is having $100 as wages, and Mary $60. They come
from time to time to visit the Home. William is thinking of having a farm of his own.

companion to an only child, and lacks no earthly comfort. The poor mother was ill-used in the
dens where she lived by her neighbours, for having, they said, sold her child. We received
a photograph of the little one from her happy Canadian home; this closed every mouth, for it
could not be gainsaid.

"Whilst stopping at one of the railway stations, we were accosted by a young man, who told
us he was one of our old boys of ten years ago, but was now settled in that town. He had 'rolled'
about a good deal, he said, but at last had settled down, and never was so happy in his life
before. He had sent for his brother to come and live with him. Since then John and his wife
have spent a day at the Gait Home, and they think in another year, if they continue to prosper,
that they also would like to be entrusted with a little one. Thus openings are ever occurring
for those yet to follow."

Since the above was written other young emigrants, now married and settled in homes of their
own, have offered to adopt orphans and children, homeless as they once were themselves.

It is good to work in faith, as those in charge of this work do; but it is also good to have
evidence as an encouragement to faith, and as a corroboration of the work. Such evidence he,
as in a sense a special commissioner, had qualified himself to give, and it gave him much pleasure
to render it.

"WOODVILLE PLACE, DUNDEE, 13th August 1873.

"MY DEAR MISS MACPHERSON,--Various ministerial and pastoral occupations, since my return home,
have prevented me from carrying out my intention of putting into shape my impressions and thoughts
about Canada and your work. If the Lord will, I shall do so at no great distance of time. Meanwhile,
allow me to express in a few words my mature judgment in regard to the leading features of
your work. It seems to me to furnish the key to the solution of one of the most difficult problems
in Home Mission work.

"The character of the training to which the children are subjected previous to their removal
to Canada appears to be all that could be desired. I was delighted with their knowledge of
Scripture, their general intelligence, their respectful bearing to their superiors, their promptness
of obedience, and other evidences of religious conviction working itself out in their general
conduct. The extraordinary care exhibited in the selection of homes and in the placing of them
out in Canada strikes me as one of the most important and valuable elements of the work. Most
of all was I charmed with the noble Christian character of your fellow-workers, and was thoroughly
convinced that a very remarkable measure of the blessing of God rests upon the entire movement.
I anticipate the most precious results for time, and in view of eternity the issues of the
movement will exceed all calculation. I could say much more, but for the present must forbear.
For the sake of the poor, dear, lost little ones in our large towns; for the sake of Canada,
of whose wants I am not ignorant; for the sake of humanity, and, above all, for the Lord's
sake, I heartily wish you were enabled to carry every summer thousands instead of hundreds
of little children across the Atlantic to be settled in those beautiful Canadian regions, where
by God's blessing they may grow up 'trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that
He might be glorified.'

"Go on, my dear friend; the Lord is manifestly with you, and He will bless you still-aye, and
more than ever.

"JOHN MACPHERSON."

"November 5th, 1874.

"Having just returned from a six weeks' visit to Canada, I wish to add my testimony to the
many already given of the very valuable work of Miss Macpherson in the three Homes which she
has established in Canada for young British destitute children, each Home under the direction
of devoted and much esteemed Christian ladies.

"Lady Cavan and I found much pleasure in visiting all these Homes, situated in different parts
of the Dominion of Canada, in each of which children are received from two to twelve years
of age, looked after with motherly affection. The greater number sent out this year had been
provided for.

"There is a great demand for young children in this country, where domestic and farming servants
are so few, and numbers of these children are adopted into families, the greatest care being
taken to place them with kind and good people. They are either trained for the place which
they will occupy, or, for the most part, are loved and treated as children of the house.

"It needs but to see for oneself the happy, bright faces of the children, to be satisfied of
the value and importance of this transplanting institution for the rescuing of children from
their degraded position, for which they are in nowise responsible. May many be brought under
the Christian, happy influence of Miss Macpherson, through the liberality of those interested
in our poor."

"CAVAN."

What a work of blessing is being carried on by the different Homes here! My soul has been greatly
refreshed this Christmas in seeing some of the dear boys return to 'Blair Athol,' to spend
a few days with our sister Miss Macpherson. The change in appearance, from London's hapless
poverty and degradation, to this glorious clime,-- bright, rosy faces, full of laughter and
fun, and yet deeply interested in the dear, loving Saviour, whose Spirit thus practically tells
His own sweet story of love to their young hearts. One dear fellow specially delighted me.
I was present as he was ushered in with his little brother, his eyes full of tears of gratitude
and joy as he said to Miss Macpherson, 'Please, Miss, here's a present for you,' drawing a
large, fat, beautiful goose from under his arm, carefully packed. Excuse my adjectives, but
I cannot help it, for I fairly loved the boys; and when I looked back but four years, and contrasted
their hapless life (workhouse children) in one of our English provincial towns, my spirit was
full of gladness, and I thanked God for these broad lands, and the untiring energy of the band
of workers and friends who so intelligently and successfully save them from poverty, crime,
and wretchedness, and by change of position, sympathy, common sense, and Christian love, fit
them for useful, prosperous lives here, and, by grace, for eternal glory yonder.

"HENRY VARLEY"

The following is from a Canadian friend and benefactor:--

"Dear Miss Macpherson,--My attention has been called to a communication referring unfavourably
to your work in bringing out the little waifs and strays from England, and placing them in
farmers' homes in the country of this Canada of ours. I have thought that perhaps a letter
from me, giving my experience, might not be out of place.

"Fully eleven years ago I first heard of your intention to bring out some young emigrants to
Canada, and as I heard that they were of the degraded, vicious, and criminal class, I did not
look with favour upon the effort. Being in England shortly after the first lot came out, without
making my object known, I went down to the East End of London repeatedly, and personally inquired
into the working of the scheme, saw the gathering in from the widows' families, the orphans,
the destitute, and those worse than orphans. I saw the cleaning, the fresh clothing, the training
in work and discipline, and, above all, the schooling in religious teaching from God's Book,
and singing sweet Gospel hymns. I was satisfied that this part of the work was being well done
in England, and great care exercised in selecting only suitable cases and giving lengthened
training; so that the girls and boys from the youngest to those of thirteen and fourteen years
of age, when drafted to Canada in fifties and hundreds, looked likely youngsters for workers
in this land of plenty.

"After my return to Canada, having got thoroughly interested in the work, seeing at least that
it was doing a good work for London in relieving the over-population there, I decided, if in
my judgment the work was as well cared for in Canada, and as much care exercised in placing
them out in homes as in gathering in and training, then it would prove a good work for Canada also.

"Now, (after over ten years), I can say, from large personal experience, that the placing of
several thousands of these young, sturdy, willing workers in the homes of our Canadian fanners,
through this agency, has been a blessing to Canada, not only as workers, but also in many cases
carrying good religious influences with them. The greatest care is exercised in selecting suitable
homes, and in no case is a child placed out unless the applicant brings good certificates of
character from the minister or justice of the peace. I was aint be ne'er act we told beaten for neighbours.

 As it came, so
was the money spent, leaving us often with a very small balance, but always on the right side.

"When the funds have been low we have often been led to wonder and adore the love that placed
our burdens upon the hearts of others, causing them to consider Him who loved them, and who
had enjoined us to go forth and sympathise with the 'Christies' grinding their old organs,
and the 'Jessicas,' with broken hearts, crying for bread in the alleys of our great city.

"Our sainted sister, Miss Havergal, once earnestly entreated us to write on about the needs
of little children. Mrs. Herbert Taylor, now in glory, said, 'Oh continue unto the end pleading
the Christ-like cause.'

"Yes! we are stewards, and not of money only.

"Do these departed workers regret one effort made for Jesus? It is only now we can watch with
Him for the little children,--the opportunities for self-denial will soon be past. No more
long voyages, or sleepless nights,--soon the Lord Himself will come, our bungling and failures
all blotted out by the blood on the Mercy-seat. "been out much? Had been the visitors?"

She shook her head. "yesterday said out and are well had been own
horses." It find out if she went that this hospitality whom was so and
company. "I to find no we was nonplussed," never been, "him left i,"
more present. 47, 48). Would we follow Him, then shall we be faithful stewards
of every gift with which He has entrusted us. When we have had nothing left but Himself,-so
near to faith's vision,--then how inexpressibly full has shone out one or other of the 33,000
precious, never-failing promises.

"Precious Comforter! drawing ever near to His oft 'perplexed, reasoning, troubled' ones; waiting
to comfort them; showing them His hands and His feet, and lifting those hands to bless them
(Luke xxiv)."

  "And He who is Himself the Gift and Giver--
      The future glory and the present smile,
   With the bright promise of the glad 'for ever,'
      Will light the shadows of the 'little while!'"

"YET A LITTLE WHILE, AND HE THAT SHALL COME WILL COME, AND WILL NOT TARRY."

THE END.
