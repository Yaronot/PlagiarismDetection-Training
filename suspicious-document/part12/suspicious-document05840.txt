Any picture, print, or engraving, that represents a noble thought, that depicts a heroic act,
or that brings a bit of nature from the fields or the streets into our room, is a teacher,
a means of education, and a help to self-culture. It serves to make the home more pleasant
and attractive. It sweetens domestic life, and sheds a grace and beauty about it. It draws
the gazer away from mere considerations of self, and increases his store of delightful associations
with the world without, as well as with the world within.

The portrait of a great man, for instance, helps us to read his life. It invests him with a
personal interest. Looking at his features, we feel as if we knew him better, and were more
closely related to him. Such a portrait, hung up before us daily, at our meals and during our
leisure hours, unconsciously serves to lift us up and sustain us. It is a link that in some
way binds us to a higher and nobler nature.

It is said of a Catholic money-lender that when about to cheat, he was wont to draw a veil
over the face of his favourite saint. Thus the portraiture of a great and virtuous man is in
some measure a companionship of something better than ourselves; and though we may not reach
the standard of the hero, we may to a certain extent be influenced by his likeness on our walls.

It is not necessary that a picture should be high-priced in order to be beautiful and good.
We have seen things for which hundreds of guineas have been paid, that have not one-hundredth
part of the meaning or beauty that is to be found in Linton's woodcut of Rafaelle's Madonna,
which may be had for twopence. The head reminds one of the observation made by Hazlitt upon
a picture, that it seems as if an unhandsome act would be impossible in its presence. It embodies
the ideas of mother's love, womanly beauty, and earnest piety. As some one said of the picture:
"It looks as if a bit of Heaven were in the room."

Picture-fanciers pay not so much for the merit, as for the age and the rarity of their works.
The poorest may have the seeing eye for beauty, while the rich man may be blind to it. The
cheapest engraving may communicate the sense of beauty to the artizan, while the thousand-guinea
picture may fail to communicate to the millionaire anything,--excepting perhaps the notion
that he has got possession of a work which the means of other people cannot compass.

Does the picture give you pleasure on looking at it? That is one good test of its worth. You
may grow tired of it; your taste may outgrow it, and demand something better, just as the reader
may grow out of Montgomery's poetry into Milton's. Then you will take down the daub, and put
up a picture with a higher idea in its place. There may thus be a steady progress of art made
upon the room walls. If the pictures can be put in frames, so much the better; but if they
cannot, no matter; up with them! We know that Owen Jones says it is not good taste to hang
prints upon walls--he would merely hang room papers there. But Owen Jones may not be infallible;
and here we think he is wrong. To our eyes, a room always looks unfurnished, no matter how
costly and numerous the tables, chairs, and ottomans, unless there be pictures upon the walls.

It ought to be, and no doubt it is, a great stimulus to artists to know that their works are
now distributed in prints and engravings, to decorate and beautify the homes of the people.
The wood-cutter, the lithographer, and the engraver, are the popular interpreters of the great
artist. Thus Turner's pictures are not confined to the wealthy possessors of the original works,
but may be diffused through all homes by the Millars, and Brandards, and Wilmotts, who have
engraved them. Thus Landseer finds entrance, through woodcuts and mezzotints, into every dwelling.
Thus Cruikshank preaches temperance, and Ary Scheffer purity and piety. The engraver is the
medium by which art in the palace is conveyed into the humblest homes in the kingdom.

The Art of Living may be displayed in many ways. It may be summed up in the words,--Make the
best of everything. Nothing is beneath its care; even common and little things it turns to
account. It gives a brightness and grace to the home, and invests Nature with new charms. Through
it, we enjoy the rich man's parks and woods, as if they were our own. We inhale the common
air, and bask under the universal sunshine. We glory in the grass, the passing clouds, and
the flowers. We love the common earth, and hear joyful voices through all Nature. It extends
to every kind of social intercourse. It engenders cheerful goodwill and loving sincerity. By
its help we make others happy, and ourselves blest. We elevate our being and ennoble our lot.
We rise above the grovelling creatures of earth, and aspire to the Infinite. And thus we link
time to eternity; where the true Art of Living has its final consummation.
