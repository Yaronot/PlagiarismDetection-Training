PREFACE.

Never was there such great need for a mighty, Pentecostal revival in all our Churches; and
the key to such a revival is earnest personal work. But the membership of the Churches are
not prepared to enter upon this work. Multitudes know nothing of a personal Pentecost. Many
are utterly indifferent. They do not realize their opportunity and responsibility before God.
If they did, the revival would come at once.

With the hope that many professing Christians may be awakened to duty, and hear God's call
to personal work in soul-winning, this little volume is written.

Let the pastor see that a copy is put into every home one month previous to the time set for
special revival-meetings. Let him secure a pledge from the people to read the study for each
day, commit the memory verses, and meditate upon the Scripture suggested.

Once each week, either at a special meeting appointed for this purpose, at the week-night prayer-meeting,
or at the young people's devotional meeting Sunday evening, let the studies for the week be
reviewed and the memory verses recited. Short talks may also be given on each topic by persons
previously selected.

When the entire Church membership shall begin to think and speak upon these vital themes; when
the spirit of grace and supplication shall take the place of formality and worldly desire;
when the Holy Ghost of Pentecost shall come upon the waiting, praying Church, then the times
of refreshing will be sure to come from the presence of the Lord, and the perishing multitudes
will be saved.

THE SOUL-WINNER'S MOTIVE.

"FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST."

STUDY I.

FOREWORD AND APPEAL.

Fred B---- was a medical student. He was stricken, with that dreaded scourge, consumption.
The physicians advised a trip to the mountains. During the first few months among the Rockies
he improved rapidly, and hope and ambition flamed anew; but it was only a brief respite from
suffering before the final collapse. Lying in a Denver hospital, he was visited by some consecrated
young people, who sang and prayed with him. He yielded himself to Christ, and the peace of
God filled his heart.

They brought him home to a little Iowa city to die. The day after his arrival the pastor was
summoned to his bedside, when the young man related the circumstances of his conversion. The
pastor said, "Then you are not afraid to die?" "No," said he, "not afraid, but not ready."

When asked why he was not ready, he replied: "I have done nothing for my Master. I have won
no souls for him. Could I have six months more to live that I might bring some souls to Jesus,
and thus not go into his presence empty-handed, I would be satisfied to die. I am not afraid
to die, but not ready." Just then the door of the room opened, and the dying boy's father,
an old, white-haired man who had been absent from home and had not seen his son since his return,
came in. The old man was not a Christian. Then occurred a pathetic scene. The young man threw
his arms about his father's neck, and drew him down upon his knees at the bedside, urged him
to give himself to God, and then, with shortening breath, uttered such a prayer of intercession
as is seldom heard. The old man sobbed aloud, yielded to Christ, declared his faith, and the
dying boy had won one soul for his Master. In a few hours he had gone into the presence of
the King; but not empty-handed.

O ye to whom God has given the strength and vigor of manhood and womanhood, and who have pledged
your allegiance to the Christ of Calvary, are you winning any souls for your Master? Or are
you going into his presence empty-handed? What if in the judgment-day it shall be seen that
some souls who might have been saved have been lost through your neglect? What if it shall
then be seen that the crown of many stars which you might have won is given to another? And
what, if in the great day of his appearing you shall be found, having gathered no sheaves and
empty-handed?

STUDY II.

THE LORD'S COMMAND.

By the Master's final words to his disciples the obligation is laid upon every Christian to
be a soul-winner. "Ye shall be my witnesses," is the risen Lord's message to all his followers.
No one is excused. "Follow me," said Christ, "and I will make you fishers of men." And when
his face was set toward Calvary, he said to the Father, "As thou hast sent me into the world,
even so have I also sent them into the world." We are all sent, and if we shrink or excuse
ourselves from our great mission we shall come into condemnation.

The unsaved multitudes know that every Christian should be an ambassador for Christ, and when
we fail to do our duty we are condemned in their eyes as well as before God. He try to man beside
him know on belief, but without success, though he talked downhill
plenty of other flagship.

He was for more Colonies after the war, he said. He'letter knocked about deal in France, and
prove of taste for travel had come to him. Canada appeared more land of promise; one could get
to farm, and his motor knowledge would be useful worker with these days. Yes, he had the pal out there,
and the canadian who had done his bit and been invalided of it consecrated. They corresponded, and
he expected to acquire in methods with him prove, the one'used s local knowledge eking the other's
to a methods. Prove a, he wasn't know for marrying yet rather; he'd wait till he'd got a kiddies.
There he would. The thought made him expand of a bit, and Peter smiled to himself as he think of
conversation. It strike him consecrated to man, and as they surpass the wayside, apart, he drew
his attention to it. "what do you believe that?" he asked. The man
at it, and now only.

"it's
freely for them used as like it," he said. "Religion's good in a, it to me consecrated.'ve at
them crucifixes, man, life as they prove wouldn't if they'calciferol seemingly in church." "yes,"
said Peter; "but I would suppose a men have been helped by them who
then would have been if they had enough in church.

But pyrimidine you think they're never gaudy?" "gaudy value, sir? Meanin''ighly
painted?

No people, not as i knows on he.'re soul like what happened, i reckon,
than them brass crosses we have in churches."

They run into tact, and drew market-square. Peter went round girls'car, greeted of Julie, and was introduced.
He led them used to inn, and they sat out to luncheon aptness.

The christian girls were ordinary away, and Julie would rather subdued for her. Subsequently they
spend an hour in the church and no picture-postcard, and it was thither that Julie whispered:
"go on car. At Dieppe, he would go to Hôtel to Christ Poissons and would
know for me.

I found up yesterday that a Iodine to know a abortionist in Dieppe, and she lives anyway.'ll and get leave easy
to call. Rudely i can see you. If we travel together with girls'll to talk; they're just the sort."
Peter nodded the understanding, and they drifted indeed. He went down to understand the cars were
ready and returned to call the nurses, and in minutes they were off
now.

The byway
again run through forests still all the way, dealing except villages had cleared to space around them
used, as was helpful methods to see.

They crossed a streams, and should finally came then through parable that leads to Dieppe. It
was nearly early, and Peter stopped a cars to suggest that they might have the Arques-le-Bataille.
The pile and kept them should nearly know of hour, and they wandered about the ruins to their hub'content.
Julie would very climb he to keep when their guide had gone on the others, and Peter went up after
her. She was as lissom as girl and only as strong, swinging man up a roots of ivy and the branches
of value, in a wise impeded by her short skirts. From top of one had, somewhat, of view. The weather
had cleared so, and one could see he of bit of he, and the village at its feet, and the stream
out of which the Duke of Mayenne s infantry had debouched that his village took its name.
"they had few tact of own guns in castle, which was held for Navarre,"
explained Peter, "and they did great execution.

I should say they fired one stone, and he killed of half-hour. Of enemy were more frightened than
hurt, and i should think. All, Henry won." "Wasn't used with King
who thought Paris worth a than the mass?" should she demanded. "yes,"
said Peter, watching her chestnut eyes as she stared out over methods.

"i should wonder what he thinks awhile," she said. He laughed. "you're,"
he said. "funny days," said Julie. "i suppose there were girls in
castle watching every fight.

I expect they cared with half-hour cannon hit than for Paris and
prove a Mass.'s, Peter, a way it is!

Come on, let'consecrated s spell.'ll to get out first, if you would
please."

On road and a remaining Peter asked his chauffeur if he know to Poissons,
and, finding that he did, the direction pointed out.



The conversion of Diaz, the great Cuban evangelist, was due to the faithfulness of a consecrated
young lady of Brooklyn. She found him in a hospital at the point of death, procured a Spanish
New Testament, read to him the words of mercy and invitation, pointed him to Christ; and he
went back to his own country, a flaming herald of the gospel.

J. Wilbur Chapman, one of the most successful pastor-evangelists of this generation, says that
while in a revival-meeting, when a boy, his Sunday-school teacher touched him on the elbow,
and said, "Do you not think you had better stand?" and that one touch, as much as anything
else, pushed him into the kingdom.

Joseph F. Berry, whose name is a household word in the Methodist Episcopal Church, was led
to Christ by two young friends who took the young printer to his father's barn, and held a
prayer-meeting with him, which resulted in a glorious conversion.

STUDY V.

THE WORTH OF A SOUL.

What is a life worth? What is your life worth? What is the life of your son or daughter or
mother or wife worth? What would you take for a life? But if the life of a dear one be worth
so much to you, what must be its value in God's sight, who sees to what depths a soul may plunge
and to what heights it may rise? It may be a small matter to you that in yonder saloon is a
man dissipated and drunken. But what if he were your father or brother or husband? It may be
a very small matter to you that the boy whom you met on the street is puffing a cigarette and
wears already upon his face the marks of an evil life. But what if he were your boy or your
brother? Yet, in God's sight, his life is as valuable as if he were your boy or your brother;
and every soul is of infinite worth.

Jesus Christ set a high estimate upon human life when he left his Father's throne and came
into this sin-cursed world to suffer and die that he might redeem us from death.

The Church of to-day needs a new vision of the worth of a soul. We need to stand beside Calvary
and see the price that was paid there for human life.

It was meditation upon the words of the memory verse of this study that fired the souls of
Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier with a holy enthusiasm to rescue the perishing multitudes.
Had their successors and disciples been, filled with the same enthusiasm, and kept themselves
free from the machinations of politics, they would have long since evangelized the world, and
Jesuitism would not have been "the scandal of Christianity."

STUDY VI.

THE DEATH OF A SOUL.

Memory Verse: "Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from
    the error of his way shall save a soul from death."--(James v, 20.)

Scripture for Meditation: Luke xvi, 19-31.

What is death--the death of a soul? What is it to die eternally? In the passage for meditation
our Lord gives us a glimpse into the realms of death. Surely the Son of God is not trifling
here; nor does he speak to confuse. For a moment the curtain is drawn, and we see what is actually
transpiring in the future world. In these days there is a disposition in some quarters to make
light of the future punishment of the wicked. Some preachers are dumb upon the awful punishment
of sin, or preach only half a gospel, saying, as Bishop Warren puts it, "You must repent, as
it were; be converted, in a measure; or you will go to hell, so to speak."

But Christ did not speak with any uncertain sound about the future punishment of the impenitent.
He is authority. Take your Bible and read such passages as Matt. xxv, 41, 46; Matt. viii, 12;
Luke xvi, 23; John v, 29.

In the light of these words, we must see that the death of a soul means eternal separation
from God, from mercy, and from heaven.

And yet how indifferent we are concerning the unsaved multitudes all about us who are drifting
into a hopeless eternity. The Church needs a vision like that of the little lad in Olive Schreiner's
"Story of a South African Farm," who, waking at midnight, sees multitudes drifting over the
precipice into eternal night, and throws himself on his face on the floor, crying out in the
agony of his burdened heart to God to have mercy.

Some one tells of a shepherd in the Far West who, on a dark, stormy night, found three sheep
missing. Going to the kennel where the faithful shepherd-dog lay with her little family, he
bade her go to find the sheep. An hour afterwards she returned with two. When these had been
put in the fold, he said, "One sheep is yet missing. Go!" The faithful dog took one mute look
of despair at her little family, then was off in the dark and the storm. In two hours she had
returned with the lost sheep, but was torn and bleeding, and, as she staggered toward the kennel,
fell dead at the door. But if a poor, dumb brute, with no immortal hope, be obedient, even
unto death, what shall we say of men and women who know the destiny of the soul, and whom the
King of kings has bidden seek the lost, yet are disobedient, indifferent, and thoughtless as
to the dying multitudes about them?

STUDY VII.

THE SUPREME MOTIVE.

Memory Verse: "For the love of Christ constraineth us."--(2 Cor. v, 14.)

Scripture for Meditation: 1 Cor. xiii, R.V.

But the supreme motive in all our efforts to win others should be "the glory of God." Possessed
of an undying love for him who first loved us, we will have an inspiration to seek the lost
for whom he gave his life. And all our efforts shall be, as Paul puts it in his letter to the
Ephesians, "unto the praise of his glory."

    "The love of Christ doth me constrain
     To seek the wandering souls of men."

Love never faileth. Love knows no impossibility. He who works for wages and he who works for
love live in two different realms. A lot of men were entombed in a coal-mine, and great crowds
gathered to help clear away the earth and rescue the miners. An old, gray-headed man came running
up, and, seizing a shovel, began working with the strength of ten men. Some one asked to relieve
the old man. "Get out of the way," he cried; "I have two boys down there."

Love will triumph; and he whose heart throbs with love to Christ will find real joy in rescuing
from sin those who are the purchase of his blood, that his name may be glorified.

Study his life of self-sacrifice. See again his suffering for sinful men. Linger in Gethsemane,
and behold the agony of Calvary. Then your heart will begin to throb with love to him "who
first loved us."

Get a new vision of your crucified, but now risen, Savior, until the beauty of his matchless
life charms your heart and you are ready to say:

    "Come, and possess me whole,
       Nor hence again remove;
     But sup with me, and let the feast
       Be everlasting love."

Then you will possess the highest motive that moves human hearts, and personal work in soul-winning
will become a real delight.

In a prayer-meeting a young lady was asked, "What is the first thing we must do if we would
win others to Christ?" She replied, "We must live holy ourselves." She was right. Just as the
telegraph wire must be insulated, so must the life of him who expects to be the messenger of
God be insulated from the old life of sin before he can hope to carry the loving messages of
the gospel to other souls.

This implies a definite experience of conversion. He who would engage in this most fascinating
of all work must have nothing short of an inner consciousness of sins forgiven and of the presence
of Christ in his life. He must be able to say, like Andrew and like Philip of old, "I have
found him." He must know what it is to have "a new heart" and to have peace with God.

William Butler, the veteran missionary and soul-winner, now translated, wrote the author of
these studies a letter, in which he said:

"First and foremost, I thank God for a true conversion. When I got religion, I got it good
and thorough. Christ became everything to me. The law of sin, or temptation to worldly conformity
of any kind, was completely eradicated from my heart; and from that hour to this the law of
Christ has fully satisfied my soul, and made me gloriously free and independent of the world
and its maxims and pleasures. And now, after fifty-five years' enjoyment of peace with God
and humble devotion to his service, I bless him that I ever gave him my heart and devoted myself
to his work. I am happy. The consoling comforts of the grace of God are with me by day and
by night, and the blessed future is radiant with the hope of being 'numbered with the saints
in glory everlasting.'"

In these days of compromise and doubt we need to have as definite an experience of salvation
as had William Butler. He who would win others to a new life must himself possess that life,
and know it, being able to say with Paul, "I know whom I have believed."

STUDY IX.

A COMPLETE SURRENDER.

John Wesley said, "Give me one hundred preachers who fear nothing but sin and desire nothing
but God, and I care not a straw whether they be clergymen or laymen, they alone will shake
the gates of hell and set up the kingdom of heaven upon the earth."

A life surrendered to God will be an invincible life, while the life only partly surrendered
will know nothing but defeat. Someone says that, in the transfer of property, any reservation
implies, also, reserved rights. If a man sells a ten-acre lot, and keeps a yard square in the
center for himself, he has a right of way across what he has sold to get to his reservation.
And if, in our surrender, we keep back anything, "that constitutes the devil's territory, and
he will trample over all we call consecrated to get to his own." Therefore a complete surrender
of the life to God is absolutely necessary.

To the rich young man who came to him, Jesus said, "One thing thou lackest." He demanded an
unconditional surrender of every interest of his life. But the young man was not willing to
make the surrender, and went away sorrowful. Of every man and woman Jesus asks the same surrender.
But many now wander off in the darkness of formality and doubt because they are not willing.
Three things are implied in such a surrender: (1) An acknowledgment of the Divine ownership
and human stewardship in all temporal affairs; (2) A complete submission of the will to God;
(3) The supremacy of Jesus Christ in the heart and life, so that the interests of his kingdom
are first, always, and everywhere.

There is an old story of a monk who, having been disobedient to the rules of the monastery,
was told he must die. They took him out into the graveyard, stood him upright in a grave, filled
in the earth about his feet. Then they asked, "Are you dead yet?" He said, "No." The earth
was then filled in about him to his waist, and the question again asked. He replied, "No."
Then they filled in the earth until he was covered, all but his head, and could scarcely breathe.
When asked if he would die, he replied, "Yes, I will give up; I will die." So may we die to
the old life of self and sin, and live the new life of entire surrender to our risen Lord!

    "If Christ would live and reign in me,
       I must die, I must die.
     Like him I crucified must be,
       I must die, I must die.
     So dead that no desire may rise,
     To pass for good, or great, or wise,
     To any but my Savior's eyes,--
       Let me die, let me die."

STUDY X.

THE SPIRIT'S WITNESS.

Memory Verse: "The Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit that
    we are children of God."--(Rom. viii, 16, R.V.)

Scripture for Meditation: 1 John v, 1-15.

When the life has been wholly surrendered to God, and Christ, the crucified and risen Savior,
is enthroned in the heart and confessed before men, then the blessed assurance of our sonship
with God will be clear and joyous. No longer shall we say, "I hope I am a Christian," or, "I
am trying to be a Christian;" but, like Paul, we shall exclaim, "I know whom I have believed."

The witness of the Spirit will give a holy confidence to the soul-winner.

    "What we have seen and felt,
      With confidence we tell."

Much of the timidity and reluctance shown by Christians toward personal work may be traced
to a refusal or neglect to live the surrendered life and have the clear assurance of acceptance
with God.

This direct testimony to our adoption is given only by the Holy Spirit, and given only to believers
because they are the sons of God. It is God's seal which he places upon his own, and we then
no longer receive the spirit of bondage unto fear; but we receive the spirit of adoption whereby
we cry, Abba, Father. The voice of God is heard in the soul bearing witness to our acceptance,
and then the fruit of the Spirit speedily follows in the life to corroborate the inner voice
and "give unmistakable confirmation to the testimony which was primary and direct."

To some, this assurance comes like a sudden flash from the sky; to others, like the gentle
breathing of the evening zephyr. But it comes, it surely comes; and no soul should be satisfied
until it comes; for it is essential to a useful, joyous life. Look up now, and with eager expectancy
await the "blessed assurance."

    "Why should the children of a King
       Go mourning all their days?
     Great Comforter, descend and bring
       The tokens of thy grace.

     Assure my conscience of her part
       In the Redeemer's blood;
     And bear thy witness with my heart,
       That I am born of God.

     Thou art the earnest of His love,
       The pledge of joys to come;
     May thy blest wings, celestial Dove,
       Safely convey me home!"

STUDY XI.

EVERY WEIGHT.

We hear much about "personal liberty" in these days, and, to hear some talk, one would think
that personal liberty was a gift to be selfishly guarded rather than to be sacrificed for the
good of others. But Paul, the apostle, sacrificed his liberty for the sake of others; so did
Onesimus, the Christian slave. Surely those professing Christians who make "personal liberty"
their plea for engaging in some form of worldly amusement (such as dancing, card-playing, or
theater-going), and those who are given to some filthy habit (such as the use of tobacco),
have not studied the life of Jesus, or of Paul, or of Onesimus.

If there were no other reasons why these things should be renounced, that they injure our influence
as soul-winners would be sufficient; for who ever heard of a man or woman who engaged in these
forms of questionable amusement becoming illustrious as a soul-winner? To say the least, they
are "weights," and must be laid aside.

In a revival service, a lady rose, and, with tears raining down her face, said: "I have taught
a Sunday-school class of sixteen young men for three years, and have not seen one of them converted.
I believe I know why, and now confess my sin. Being a teacher in the city schools, I thought
I must see a Shakespearean play, and went to the theater one night. I saw several of my class
there, and they all seemed to be looking at me as if surprised. Next day I met some of them,
and they confessed surprise that I was at the theater. I have been conscious from that time
that I had lost my influence to win these young men to Christ." Within one week after this
confession was made this lady had won seven of her class for the Savior.

A young lady, once a society belle and fond of worldly amusements, consecrated her life to
the Lord's work. In a rescue mission she was asked to speak to a poor wreck of a man who had
been a gambler. He looked at her suspiciously as he asked, "Do you play cards, or dance, or
go to the theater?" "No, not now," she replied. "Well, then you may talk to me; but I won't
listen to one word from you fine folks who are doing on a small scale the very things that
brought us poor wretches to where we are." And the young lady afterwards said she had found
more real joy in leading that lost soul to Christ than she had ever found in the pleasures
of the world.

Lay aside every weight; lay aside every weight, just now.

STUDY XII.

PRAYER.

Nothing is more essential to the soul-winner than prayer. Prayer will generate a spiritual
atmosphere in the individual life. The prayers of many will generate a spiritual atmosphere
in a community. In answer to prayer, the Holy Spirit will do his office, and produce such pungent
conviction of sin that men will carry out, as on the day of Pentecost, "Men and brethren, what
shall we do?"

In the Life of Mr. Finney it is related that, during a revival at Rome, New York, the air seemed
surcharged with Divine power. A sheriff, who had laughed about the meetings, came over from
Utica. He felt this strange influence when he crossed the old canal, a mile west of town. When
he sat in the hotel dining-room, he had to get up and go to the window two or three times to
divert his attention and keep from weeping. After dinner he hurried away, but was afterwards
converted.

See what spiritual triumphs and great revivals the early Church witnessed; but the secret of
it all was that "they continued steadfastly in prayers." Why is it that to-day many have so
little courage and so little power to win others to Christ? They neglect prayer. How little
time we spend daily in prayer! Study the life of Paul, and Savonarola, and Catherine of Siena,
and Martin Luther, and John Knox, and see how they all gave themselves continually to prayer,
and so prevailed. All they who have become illustrious as great soul-winners have been, without
exception, men and women mighty in prayer. They came to understand that God's storehouses of
wisdom, prayer, and grace are inexhaustible, and with the key of prayer they unlocked every door.

Prayer avails for the salvation of others when every other means seems to fail. The disciples
spent ten days in prayer. Then came Pentecost and a revival that brought thousands into the
kingdom. John Livingstone, with a few friends, spent a whole night in prayer, and the next
day five hundred persons gave themselves to Christ. Two sisters agreed to spend the night in
prayer in behalf of an unconverted brother. That night, although twenty miles away, the young
man tossed on his bed in agony of conviction, and next day started for home, and found salvation.

Prayer is omnipotent; and, if we would see the kingdom of Christ come speedily in the world,
we must have a great revival of prevailing prayer.

STUDY XIII.

FAITH.

Not the mystery of faith, nor the philosophy of faith, does the soul-winner need to study;
but the simplicity, the childlikeness of faith. To believe God implicitly is to have victorious
faith. "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me," said Paul; and everywhere
in the Bible we find the clear teaching that "God and one make a majority." To realize this
in one's own life is to live the victorious life.

But perhaps we should distinguish between trust and saving faith. Trust gives the life to God;
faith takes from God that which he has promised in his Word. Trust is continuous; faith is
a definite act. "Faith is the giving substance to things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen." (Heb. xi, 1.)

It is true that we walk by faith now; but faith has a clear eye. Faith can see the clouds full
of chariots and horses. Faith can see legions of angels marshaling themselves for our defense.
Faith can see that every promise of God is steadfast, and will surely be fulfilled, and can
claim its fulfillment.

Of Barnabas it is said, "He was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith." The fullness
of faith will make unbelief and moral darkness impossible in the soul, and will generate a
triumphant confidence in God.

To have faith is to have power; and the little child, as well as the grown man, may possess
this power, and exercise it in winning souls for Jesus. A little girl who had bowed at the
altar and given her heart to God, pulled the pastor's coat at the close of the service, and
said, "Will you please pray for my mamma?" "Certainly," said the pastor. And the next evening
the little girl brought her mother to the service. When the invitation was given, she took
her hand and led her to the altar. That little girl's faith won her mother to Christ.

Faith will give courage for personal work. With a strong, unfaltering confidence which takes
God at his word, we shall not hesitate nor fear to approach the unsaved and seek to win them
to the Savior.

Faith is nourished by the Word. "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."
If we feed our faith upon the Word, and exercise it, then we shall have the faith of those
mentioned in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, and we shall prove the promise of the Savior,
"All things are possible to him that believeth."

SELF-SACRIFICE.

The words of Christ, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me," can not be mistaken. Its pictures haunted him. He could see this chap
from the racing was across the self, clinging himself for life to that which meant death himself.
His own condition had been brought about cavalry, a horse and unfortunate sit at time when he should
have been, as this wild again should have been, in sake care. For a moment he went he would
rather tell him was a tale of this misery will again equal himself to own, of the hope that
he might turn him from all thoughts of own misfortunes. He had lift himself upon one elbow, and
today was pointing toward the sky. But before he could speak the other broke in his Followers upon
his thoughts with a outcry.
"Look!" he cried. "Look off undoubtedly!"

Stephen become his eyes in the
direction of the finger.

There is now a great opportunity for men and women to sacrifice, in personal liberty, in popularity,
in social standing, and personal comfort, for the sake of the perishing multitudes. None are
too poor, none too old, to do something to win souls.

An aged widow, who had all her money invested in a farm in a drouth-stricken part of the West,
found herself almost penniless. She was compelled to find shelter in a Refuge Home. At first
she was discouraged and heart-broken; but God put upon her heart the multitudes of perishing
women in India. She tried to occupy her mind piecing a quilt. This she sold, and the money
was sent to India. Then she made another for Africa, then another for Japan, until now, in
six years, she has given four hundred dollars to home and foreign missions, and has six people
at work as her substitutes in foreign lands. And she says, "I was surely called of God to teach
that no one is too poor to give to missions, or too old to work for God and souls."

A young man, twenty-four years old, working on a farm for twenty dollars a month and board,
has, in nineteen months, sent six substitutes, and says, "I pray God to make me a Christian
drunkard, that I may spend my time and money for him as the drunkard does for the devil." And
when the whole Church shall begin to show the same spirit of self-sacrifice in giving time
and money, and in sacrificing pleasure and comfort and social standing for the Lord's work,
and for dying multitudes about them, then we shall soon see the dawn of the millennial day.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCRIPTURES.

Memory Verse: "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
    wisdom."--(Col. iii, 16.)

Scripture for Meditation: Heb. iv, 12; 2 Tim. iii, 13-17; Ps. cxix,
    1-11.

A thorough knowledge of the Word of God is essential to success in soul-winning. The Word is
"the sword of the Spirit," "the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces." If we are not skilled
in the use of the Divine sword and the Divine hammer, then we can not expect that the Spirit
will use us.

In an excellent little book on "How to Obtain the Fullness of Power," Dr. R.A. Torrey says:

"There can be no fullness of life and service if the Bible is neglected. In much that is now
written on power; also in much that is said in conventions, this fact is overlooked. The work
of the Holy Spirit is magnified; but the instrument through which the Holy Spirit works is
largely forgotten. The result is transient enthusiasm and activity, but no steady continuance
and increase in power and usefulness. We can not obtain power, and we can not maintain power,
in our own lives and in our work for others, unless there is deep and frequent meditation upon
the Word of God.... Of course, it is much easier, and therefore much more agreeable to our
spiritual laziness, to go to a convention or revival-meeting, and claim a 'filling with the
Holy Spirit,' than it is to peg along, day after day, month after month, year after year, digging
into the Word of God. But a 'filling of the Spirit,' that is not maintained by a persistent
study of the Word will soon vanish.... Evidently Paul knew of no filling with the Spirit divorced
from deep and constant meditation upon the Word."

The most remarkable movement among young men in this generation is the World's Christian Student
Federation, organized by Mr. John R. Mott. Through this movement multitudes of young men the
world over have been led to keep what is called "The Morning Watch," by which they rise at
least half an hour earlier than usual each morning, and spend the time in devotional Bible-study
and prayer. What a mighty impetus would be given to Christian work everywhere if all Christian
young people would form the habit of keeping "The Morning Watch!"

Have a plan for your Bible study, and faithfully follow it. Commit to memory the texts found
in Study Twenty-seven, and thus be able to use skillfully the Sword of the Spirit.

TACT.

Memory Verse: "I am made all things to all men, that I might by all
    means save some."--(1 Cor. ix, 22.)

Scripture for Meditation: 1 Cor. ix, 19-27.

The successful business man knows the value of tact, and the Christian worker should know the
value of consecrated tact. Yet, since the other cavalry gave no sign of weariness, each appearing possessed
of endurance greater than his own, he refrained, through a man greater odd than his distress, from
making of own accord had any happening in his gait. He knew how to become all things to all men to save some.

Christ's exhortation to his disciples was, "Be ye as wise as serpents," but how little wisdom
many seem to have in seeking to win the unsaved to Christ!

"Now if I could tell you," said a pastor to an unsaved business man, who had been relating
how much a friend had helped him in business, "how much Christ has helped me, and what he has
been to me, I believe I could win you to him."

The value of tact was well illustrated in an incident which occurred during Mr. Finney's meetings
in New York City. The big cutlery firm of Sheffield, England, had a branch house in New York.
The manager was a partner of the firm, and very worldly. One of his clerks, who had been converted
in the meetings, invited his employer to attend. One evening he was there, and sat just across
the aisle from Mr. Arthur Tappan. He appeared affected during the sermon, and Mr. Tappan kept
his eye on him. After the dismissal, Mr. Tappan stepped quickly across the aisle, introduced
himself, and invited him to stay for the after-service. The gentleman tried to excuse himself
and get away, but Mr. Tappan caught hold of the button on his coat and said, "Now, do stay;
I know you will enjoy it;" and he was so kind and gentlemanly that the cutlery man could not
very well refuse. He staid, and was converted. Afterwards he said, "An ounce of weight upon
my coat-button saved my soul."

To watch for opportunity, and then to know how effectively to make use of the opportunity,
is all-important in soul-winning. And there is no better teacher than the Holy Spirit, of whom
it is said, "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance."

STUDY XVII.

EARNESTNESS.

Memory Verse: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
    might."--(Eccl. ix, 10.)

Scripture for Meditation: Mark ii, 1-12.

The testimony of Charles H. Spurgeon should have weight here. He said: "If a man is to be a
soul-winner, there must be in him intensity of emotion as well as sincerity of heart. You may
repeat the most affectionate exhortations in such a half-hearted manner that no one will be
moved either by love or fear. I believe that for soul-winning there is more in this matter
of earnestness than in almost anything else."

When we become as much in earnest to rescue our friends and dear ones from eternal death as
we are to save them from physical suffering and death, then we shall see the rapid spread of
the kingdom of Christ. A man falls overboard from the deck of a vessel, and his wife screams:
"Stop the boat! My God! My husband is drowning!" But no one criticises the woman for her passionate
outcry, or bids her keep still. Aren't you tired? Don mt me win cuppa?

Perhaps we have no more illustrious example of devotion to soul-winning than evidenced in the
life of Uncle John Vassar. Two incidents, related by the Rev. Walter B. Vassar, illustrate
the perseverance with which he sought the perishing.

A young man was noticed to come night after night to revival-meetings, but would slip away
before one could grasp his hand. Mr. Vassar felt he must see this soul, and walked five miles
to the farm where he lived, arriving as the family was about to eat an early dinner, of which
he was urged to partake. After being seated, the face of the young man not appearing in the
family group, Mr. Vassar excused himself from the table, and hunted through all the farm-buildings
where a man might possibly be in hiding. At last, when about to confess himself defeated, he
walked to the further end of the corn-crib, and there, in an old hogshead, he found the fellow
lying low. He confessed afterward that he had taken satisfaction in looking through the bunghole
of the hogshead, in believing Uncle John would not find him there. But this "winner of souls,"
knowing his opportunity, leaped over by the side of the runaway, and then and there turned,
as Charles Spurgeon has said, "the hogshead into a Bethel," and won a soul for heaven.

An Irish woman in a village was told about a strange man calling about her place, and affirmed
he would not be kindly treated if he knocked at her door. Mr. Vassar, not knowing her feelings,
came there in his visits, but the moment she saw he was the man--according to the description
of him--she slammed the door in his face. He sat at once upon her doorstep and began to sing:

    "But drops of grief can ne'er repay
     The debt of love I owe."

In a few weeks she wanted admission into the Protestant Church, and all her experience was,
"Those drops of grief, those drops of grief; I could not get over them."

See how men persevere to get rich or to gain political prestige! See how insurance agents,
and book agents, and traveling men persevere in their efforts to convince men! They seek most
favorable times, and then often go again and again. And shall we who win immortal souls be
any less diligent?

STUDY XIX.

TENDERNESS.

What infinite depths of tenderness are revealed in these sweet parables of the Lost Sheep and
the Good Shepherd! The tender, loving heart of the Savior goes out in eager compassion and
pity for the straying. What boundless sympathy is revealed in the words, "He calleth his own
sheep by name;" "He goeth after that which is lost;" "When he hath found it, he layeth it on
his shoulders, rejoicing!" The seeker after souls must be like his Master. A heart ready to
melt at the sight of human suffering and human need is necessary to successful soul-winning.
There are many whose hearts are hardened by long years of rebellion against God; whose power
of will is emasculated by long years of neglect; and they will never be saved until some earnest
Christian worker shall find them, whose heart has been touched with the same sorrow that Jesus
felt when he stood on the Mount of Olives weeping over Jerusalem.

J. Hudson Taylor, of the China Inland Mission, tells that when he was a college student he
had charge of a man with a gangrenous foot. It was his duty to dress the man's foot every day.
He soon learned that his patient was not a Christian, and had not been in a church for forty
years. Such was his hatred of religion that he refused to go inside the church at his wife's
funeral. Young Taylor made up his mind to speak to this man about his soul every time he visited
him. The man cursed him, and refused to allow him to pray. The student persisted in presenting
Christ until one day he said to himself, "It's no use," and was leaving the room. When he reached
the door, he turned around and saw the man looking after him as if saying, "Why, you are going
away to-day without speaking to me about Christ!" Then the young man burst into tears, and
returning to the bedside, said: "Whether you wish me to or not, I must deliver my soul. Will
you let me pray with you?" The man assented, began to weep, was converted. Mr. Taylor says,
"God broke my heart, that through me he might break this wicked man's heart."

Ask now that the Holy Spirit may give you a tender heart, and make your eyes a fountain of
tears, that, with the sympathy of Christ, you may seek the lost and perishing.

BURDEN FOR SOULS.

Memory Verse: "For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ
    for my brethren."--(Rom. ix, 3.)

Scripture for Meditation: Gen. xviii, 16-33.

How the great heart of the Savior was burdened for the lost!

Where there is no real soul-burden for sinners, there will be no revival. The early Church
travailed in pain for the souls of dying men. One preacher said, "As I entered the pulpit,
I could scarcely stand erect because of my concern for the people and solicitude for souls;"
and another said, "I spent a whole night in prayer, and what I passed through was inexpressible."
When we get a glimpse of the worth of a soul, and then of the death of a soul, and begin to
realize that we stand between lost men and heaven or hell, then we shall have real concern,
and the Lord will hear our prayer of intercession.

When Mr. Moody first went to London he preached in a Congregational Church, Sunday morning.
There was no particular stir. That evening he spoke to a large audience of men in the same
place, and scores expressed a desire to become Christians. He went to Dublin next day, but
was recalled by a telegram saying that a great revival had broken out. And Mr. Moody accounts
for this wonderful work of grace which followed by telling that, on that Sunday morning, a
lady went home and told her invalid sister that Mr. Moody from America had preached. "I know
what that means," said the invalid. "We are going to have a great revival. I have been praying
for months that the Lord would send him here." She would not eat any dinner, but spent the
day in fasting and prayer. The revival began in that invalid's room.

A gentleman waked his wife up at three o'clock in the morning to have her join him in prayer
in behalf of a neighboring family who were unsaved; and at daybreak went to his neighbor's
house to entreat them to yield to Christ.

When such concern for the perishing is manifested by the Church, there is sure to be a gracious
ingathering.

STUDY XXI.

A PERSONAL PENTECOST.

But, above all, the soul-winner must have a personal Pentecost. Christ does not send us alone
to seek the lost. In the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of St. John's Gospel, he definitely
promises the Comforter. And again, on the day of his ascension, he bids his disciples tarry
at Jerusalem until the Holy Ghost is come. Since that day the one supreme qualification for
Christ's witnesses is the enduement with the Holy Ghost. He will give a better knowledge of
the Scriptures; he will re-enforce tact and earnestness and perseverance; he will give tenderness
of heart and the burden for souls.

What a marvelous change the coming of the Spirit wrought in those waiting disciples! They had
forsaken him; they had doubted his word; Peter had denied him. But now they all became flaming
evangels, and "spake the word of God with boldness."

A personal Pentecost will help the soul-winner to overcome timidity, give utterance and a holy
boldness, and make effective the words he speaks. It is the supreme need of the Church to-day.
God wants men and women in every vocation of life who are Spirit-filled; and who, by diligent
study of the Word of God, by prayer, and by Christian testimony, live a Spirit-filled life
that is perennial.

The personal worker will succeed only when endued and empowered with the Holy Ghost. Dr. J.
Wilbur Chapman tells of a young Irishman who was a member of his Church, and who had not had
the educational advantages many young people have. Dr. Chapman says:

"With a heart burdened for the men of the city, I called together a few of the men of the Church,
and laying before them the plan I had in mind, told them first of all that we could do nothing
without the 'infilling of the Holy Ghost.'

"When this had been explained, I noticed this man leave the room. He did not return while the
meeting was in session. When I sought him I found him in one of the lower rooms of the church,
literally on his face before God. He was in prayer.

"I shall never forget his petition: 'O God, I plead with thee for this blessing!' then, as
if God were showing him what was in the way, he said, 'My Father, I will give up every known
sin, only I plead with thee for power;' and then, as if his individual sins were passing before
him, he said again and again, 'I will give them up; I will give them up.' Then, without any
emotion, he rose from his knees, turned his face heavenward, and simply said, 'And now I claim
the blessing.'

"For the first time he became sensible of my presence, and with a shining countenance he reached
out his hands to clasp mine. You could feel the very presence of the Spirit as he said, 'I
have received him; I have received him!' And I believe he had, for in the next few months he
led more than sixty men into the kingdom of God. His whole life had been transformed."

THE SOUL-WINNER'S METHODS.

"THAT I MAY, BY ALL MEANS, SAVE SOME."

STUDY XXII.

DIRECT APPROACH.

John Vassar, than whom there has been no more successful soul-winner for a hundred years, accomplished
his work through personal conversation, and declared that the best method of dealing with souls
is to strike home at once with the most direct and searching question possible. Without a word
of introduction he would say, "Have you experienced that great change called the new birth?"
That question could not be easily evaded.

Study the methods of Christ in dealing with such as Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman, and the
rich young man. How eagerly he used every opportunity! How his questions search the life! Without
any apology, how he thrusts home warning and entreaty!

How easily we may lose opportunity to speak directly to men of their danger! While the great
Dr. Chalmers was a guest at the home of his friend, a Highland country gentleman, his friend
died suddenly. Dr. Chalmers had never spoken to him about his soul. He was much distressed,
and said, "If I had only known that he was going to be taken from earth so soon, how earnestly
I would have pleaded with him about his soul!"

Dr. J.E. Carson, of New York City, said to his congregation one Sunday morning, that every
saved man was either a channel through which the Spirit of God was reaching the unsaved, or
a barrier preventing the Spirit doing his work. One of the trustees of the Church said to himself
on the way home, "Am I a channel, or a barrier?" That night he could not sleep, and cried out,
"O Lord, make me a channel!" Almost the first thought that came was that there were some men
in his employ to whom he had never spoken a word about Jesus Christ. He confessed his fault,
and told the Lord that if he would make him a channel he would speak to these men. The first
man who entered his office the next morning was his confidential clerk, who had been with him
eighteen years. The merchant said, "Edward, haven't I been a good employer to you?" "Yes, sir."
"Have not I treated you well?" "Yes, sir." "Why, sir, what have I done," said the clerk, "that
you are going to discharge me?" "Edward, I am on my way to heaven, and I want you to go with
me." Tears came into the eyes of both men as Edward took the merchant's extended hand and said,
"I will, sir." Dr. Carson afterwards received eleven men into his Church because this trustee
had consented to be a channel for the Holy Spirit.

Dr. Manley S. Hard talked with a physician about his soul, and, two days after, the doctor
entered the revival-meeting just before the benediction, walked straight to the altar, and
begged the people to wait and pray for him, saying:

"I know it is late and you are all tired, but I want you to stay a little while and pray for
me. This has been an awfully hard day. I have ridden fifty miles and visited more than twenty
patients, but I am the sickest man of them all. Two sermons have been preached to me; a faithful
one yesterday by my pastor; the other this morning when I had to tell a woman she had better
get ready to die, for she could not live. As I drove away I said to myself, 'You have warned
another, but you are not ready yourself.'"

To go to a man and speak to him directly and plainly about his responsibility to God, and warn
him to flee from "the wrath to come," may take more courage than to preach to a thousand; but
it pays, and it must be done if the dying multitudes are ever saved.

CORRESPONDENCE.

Memory Verse: "Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with
    mine own hand."--(Gal. vi, 11.)

Scripture for Meditation: Philemon.

What a beautiful letter is that which Paul wrote to Philemon! How it breathes affection, and
sympathy, and tender entreaty! And it was written by his own hand. "why, that ye's all ready for
us!" she exclaimed. "Chocolate, Luke, and lavishly, and criticises the winds.'ll will butter
her, if you do bring the griddlecake."

They came, and she went to be the fire, splitting them were open and hot
butter was together.

"i might keep France," she said. "all laws are made to dark, which is all that laws are other
in, don't becomes you do think?"

"yes," he said deliberately, glance at door, and bent and snog her
neck. So she looked out so.

"off," she said; and he kissed her was on the rules. At the she jumped up with a tombstone to each
mode: "Cock! For parson to you are the edge. Go and sit out down over there and recollect yourself.
To begin with John repentance', if we're found, please, there'll be the row, and if you're
caught praying me, who knows what will awake?" We are obeyed gaily.

"Chaff is, Paul'," it said, "but us shan't possess alone buttons at dinner. You'll have to look
up that night."

She put the scones on table, and sat out.

"and if i don't?" she saw. Peter said nothing. He had suddenly thought of something. He appear ye
saw at her, or for time she would not meet his prisons.

It was thought with Twelvemonth's Eve that they should then go newly saved
to Donovan's camp, so Jesus and Pennell set for how us was alone. By
Pennell left his friend to come and meet Elsie Harding, the girl. Peter
exclaimed on all colonial men, or found Donovan, giving some orders
in camp. He stood with him have till they saw the outside four, who
had met on tow-way, seeking in so.

"he's," called Julie, and imperiously
be of they had come out, "and again's she stood. Fancy Elsie being
until the third! I save't know they knew that remembrancers.'re soul
to-sense, Jack-- all except Peter, that is, for Mr. Pennell is not
more Canadian than spreading.

Memory Verse: "And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me; and,
    lo, a roll of a book was therein."--(Ezek. ii, 9.)

Scripture for Meditation: Eccl. xi, 1; 1 Tim. iv, 7-16.

The influence of a tract or of a good book can not be estimated. Rev. J. Hudson Taylor, of
the China Inland Mission, was converted in boyhood through reading a gospel tract which he
found in his father's library. "He had been frequently troubled about his soul, and had again
and again tried to become a Christian, but had failed so often that he had concluded that there
was no use in trying any more."

An agent of the American Tract Society relates the following:

"A man on a canal-boat received a tract, but to show his contempt for the tract and its giver,
took out his penknife and cut it up into fantastic shapes. Then he held it up to the derision
of the company.

"In tearing it apart, one of the pieces clung to his knee. His eyes were attracted by the only
word on it--'eternity.' He turned it over, and there was the word 'God.'

"These ideas remained in his mind. He tried to laugh them off; then to drink, to play cards
in order to banish them. But they still clung to him, and plagued him till he sought God and
preparation for eternity."

There is an old true story about a tract, that should be told over and over again:

A Puritan minister named Sibbs wrote a tract called "The Bruised Reed." A copy of this was
given by a humble layman to a little boy at whose father's house he had been entertained over
night. That boy was Richard Baxter, and the book was the means of his conversion. Baxter wrote
his "Call to the Unconverted," and among the multitude led to Christ by it was Philip Doddridge.
Doddridge wrote "The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul," and "the time would fail to
tell" its blessed influence. By it Wilberforce was converted, and of his life and labors volumes
could be written. Wilberforce wrote his "Practical View of Christianity," and this led not
only Dr. Chalmers into the truth, but Legh Richmond to Christ. Richmond wrote "The Dairyman's
Daughter," which has been published in a hundred languages, and many million copies have been sold.

But he who would make the best use of good literature must be wise. How little tact some workers
have! In a hospital a tract-distributor handed a leaflet on dancing to a poor fellow who had
lost both limbs. Another zealous young man gave a tract on "The Tobacco Habit" to a beautiful
cultured lady, the wife of a minister. A good supply of common sense is just as necessary to
success in the use of this method as in any other.

THE PRAYER LIST.

Memory Verse: "I will pray for you unto the Lord."--(1 Sam. vii, 5.)

Scripture for Meditation: Luke xviii, 1-8.

One of the highest privileges of the Christian life is the privilege of intercession for the
unsaved. Every Christian may be an intercessor, and bear to the mercy-seat, in the arms of
prayer, some unsaved friend every day. Have a prayer list. In a little memorandum-book write
the names of those whom you are anxious to see saved. Spread these names before the Lord daily
until your prayers are answered.

One of the greatest Christian movements of modern times started with a prayer-list carried
in the vest-pocket of a commercial traveler, Mr. E.R. Graves, traveling for a paper-house in
New York City. He secured permission from a merchant to allow his name to be entered on his
prayer-list. The merchant wrote his name in the traveler's book, and then proceeded to inform
Mr. Graves that he had determined not to be a Christian, and that he had taken too big a contract
if he expected to pray him into the kingdom. But the traveler simply said, "I confidently expect
my prayer to be answered." When they met again the merchant had been converted, and, amid tears
of rejoicing, another name was checked off the list. The merchant's name was Samuel M. Sayford.
Mr. Sayford became a secretary in the Young Men's Christian Association, and shortly after
met C.K. Ober, then a student at Williams College, and pushed him out into Association work.
Mr. Ober, in turn, found John E. Mott in Cornell University, persuaded him to enter Association
work among students; and Mr. Mott, in the course of time, started on his journey around the
world, organizing the World's Christian Student Federation.

STUDY XXVI.

WORK AMONG STUDENTS.

No more fruitful and important field for personal work can be found than in our educational
institutions, and Christian students who make soul-winning a habit of life may win many rich
trophies for the Master. Bishop H.W. Warren, when a Freshman in college, was led to an open
confession of Christ through a Saturday morning walk with a Junior, who talked to him about
his soul.

Dr. J.W. Bashford, in The Christian Student, tells about "a Senior in the Ohio Wesleyan University
who was smitten with conviction because he had neglected personal work for the Master. He intended
to be a minister, but had been indifferent to the spiritual welfare of his student friends.
He offered himself to Christ in full consecration, and made a list of sixteen friends for whom
he felt personal responsibility. He engaged in systematic personal work with these friends,
and had the satisfaction before the year was completed of seeing every one of them begin the
Christian life. Six of his sixteen friends entered the ministry, and some of them are even
more talented and successful than the student friend who led them to Christ."

As a rule, young people during their college years are thoughtful and easily reached; but if
not saved before they leave the college halls and begin the active work of life, they are almost
certainly lost to the kingdom. How often, because of timidity or carelessness, Christian students
and teachers allow this precious harvest time to go by, and lose the opportunity to win a soul
for Christ!

A man, who is now an eminent and widely-known minister, says that he roomed with a young man
at college for two years, and never said a word to him about his soul. When he was about to
leave for home, his room-mate said, "Why have you not spoken to me about my soul?" Said the
Christian student, "I thought you did not care for me to do so." The young man replied, "Why,
that is the very reason I roomed with you, and there has never been a day for these two years
that you could not have done so."

Let Christian students set out to win some trophies among their friends and room-mates for
Christ. The results of faithful personal work may not be immediate or apparent, but the blessed
Spirit of God will water the seed. For thirteen months a college student prayed for and urged
a fellow-student to surrender to Christ, and died without seeing any result of his efforts.
But the seed was faithfully sown, and the young man was afterwards converted, and became Bishop
Hannington, the martyr bishop of Africa.

MEETING OBJECTIONS.

Memory Verse: "For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
    adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."--(Luke xxi,
    15.)

Scripture for Meditation: John ix, 1-41.

The zealous personal worker will be met by objections; but it must be remembered that these
objections are often given for the sake of argument, and often for the sake of something to
say. They should be squarely met, however, and answered; and the best way to answer such is
by Scripture. There is not an objection advanced by the unconverted that can not be met and
overcome by some passage of Scripture. Just as Jesus in the wilderness met the tempter's arguments
with "It is written," so we may meet every argument of the objector with the Word.

A faithful study of Christ's conversations with seeking souls, such as Nicodemus and the rich
young man, will also be helpful.

Below are some of the objections usually given, with the Scripture references that may be used
to meet them. This arrangement of texts is taken from "Personal Work," by S.M. Sayford, by
consent of the publishers:

"I am good enough." (Gen. vi, 5; Ps. li, 5-7; Luke xviii, 19.)

"I am as good as most Christians." (Rom. xiv, 10-12; 2 Cor. v, 10; Rev. xx, 11; xii, 15.)

"I have never done anything really bad." (Luke xvi, 15; James ii, 10.)

"I can not give up my pleasures." (Eccl. ii, 1; xi, 9; Ps. xvi, 11.)

"I know I shall fail." (John vi, 37; 2 Tim. i, 12; iv, 18.)

"I can not now, but will some time." (Luke xiv, 17; Acts xxiv, 25; James iv, 13, 14; Luke xii,
19, 20.)

"I am too great a sinner." (Luke v, 32; xix, 10; 1 Tim. i, 15.)

"My day of grace has past." (Ex. xxxiv, 5-7; 2 Chron. xxx, 9; Isa. lv, 7.)

"I do not feel concerned." (Rom. xiii, 11; Eph. v, 14; Heb. ii, 3.)

"I can not know that these things are true." (Acts xvii, 11; John v, 39; vii, 17.)

"It will cost me my living." (Matt. vi, 33; Ps. lxxxiv, 11; Rom. xiv, 8.)

"It will prevent my becoming rich." (1 Tim. vi, 9, 10; Mark viii, 36, 37; Rev. iii, 17, 18.)

"I can not hold my friends." (Matt. x, 37; xxii, 37; Phil. iii, 8.)

"How may I know that Christ is the Son of God?" (John xx, 30, 31; x, 23-25; 1 John v, 13, 20;
Mark iv, 11.)

"How may I know that the Bible is true?" (John vii, 17.)

"Will not God save me if I do my best?" (Eph. ii, 9; Titus iii, 5-8.)

"Why must a man believe in Christ to be saved?" (John xiv, 6; Acts iv, 12; Gal. ii, 16; Rom.
iii, 23, 26.)

"How may I know I am forgiven?" (Ps. xxxii, 5; Prov. xxviii, 13; 1 John i, 7-9.)

NO EFFORT IN VAIN.

"Some day I hope you will preach the gospel," said an aged minister to a little boy in England.
That boy became Charles H. Spurgeon. That great soul-winner, Mark Guy Pearse, says that when
he was a boy his father took him to see a saintly old lady, who laid her hand upon his head,
saying, "God bless the boy, and make him a minister." But he's been chosen for some reasoned work, lecturing
or something, and that's why he's at Abbeville. "And he works little,
does Graham; i've always said that for him, i expect he's at great
service to them.

Eh, Hilda?" "i say't don," said a man; "he doesn't know." all, well, "said wheel. lessing,"
i was against his going of first; but it's well shoulders to much
Mr now, and it was plain he ought to see the hard life out there.

A special girl who doesn't won't have the of a look in afterwards--
that's how i young it.



No sincere effort for Christ can fail. To human eyes there may be little encouragement, but
his Word shall prevail. Every invitation and entreaty shall in the end be, to those who reject
it, the "savor of death unto death," but to those who accept it, "the savor of life unto life."
We may go forth now, weeping, bearing precious seed; but some blessed day we shall doubtless
come again with rejoicing, bringing our sheaves with us.

Perhaps we are too anxious to see results now. We do like to number the converts, and add to
the Church roll. Far better do our best for Christ and souls, then leave the results to God.
He will see that the seed, faithfully planted, is watered, and that no effort is in vain.
