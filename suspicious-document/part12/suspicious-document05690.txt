 Over the moor grasses waved silver and red flowering sorrel. The Foliage of the
birches was already getting dark, but bright green of the beech forest stand in the distance.
And white round summer clouds floated through the sky, a mild, breezy wind swayed and flickered
through all the floating, moving branches and leaves, and blew through the flowering grass waves
that her on the chill Erten thousands of fine colors and soft lines, waved and waved.

Richard reeling with happiness this spring rush that he, the big city child, between dusty classrooms
and the sunless Hofwohnung bound, never in the fullness of his Gloss had met. Each morning drive
through the gray-green silk of sprouting oat fields by the gold of the sun rape widths, past the
emerald of the rich marshes, of which the black and white spotted cows stood out as effective in the Frame
of the flowering Hedges in the sand ravines - where it chirped and whistled from the life
of the nesting bird families - Each way to school with brave brown Liese, the unfit for military
service been found, it was an experience. Sometimes he let the reins hang and good animal
trotted on the usual way - but he looked into the blue sky and followed the Vertebrate flight
of the skylark, the smooth glide that gently melt the white summer clouds. In the Night he ran
out into the marsh, saw the mist blowing in the mild and the white moon reflected that began to shine the
Geschwebe opal - heard sunk on the Liebesgequake and din of the frogs - on all the sliding, slipping,
slipping in the small animal world strangely excited the night awake through - the magical toad
looked mighty and dreadful hop contracts with their warts on the back of his way as an enchanted
Hexenweib saw the strangely stunted figures of the old alder in the dark rivers Crouch and
to take something incomprehensible - their branches as wide longing arms in the air. The Ground
swayed and shook under his feet, which sank here - fell - he had to jump hastily on safe ground
- and knew a thousand times before orbenes, transformed and new stationary life there in the
brown depth that the sucking going down, which also ventured incautiously on them. And the shudder
of mortality by waving his cool blood that throbbed and glowed still flat in his veins, while the
nostrils of the heavy giddy love sweet scents of spring night . Entwine one

And so it happened that he came home, hair and clothes in the moist freshness, the tangy smell
of the nebula, the budding Gekräuts, boots covered with mud and earth, a young Forest and
Moorschratt, his eyes lit by the moonlight all. Light he saw earlier in the Studio window, under
the roof. It drove him hinaufzuspringen, cautiously ascended the stairs, at the door of the
sleeping mother over to "him, he knew up there to give a piece of his good luck. Nothing else.
Darkness all around, humidity, heavy air trapped. He felt it a contradiction, again a downright hostility between
his character and Rolfes' beings. The man - the world's artists, for which there were no borders,
no national differences - only differences in strength and weakness, in beautiful and ugly, for the
mean of this war no upward movement, but a collapse, a collapse of
his world of good Europeanism.

"Good
Europeans" - even as a term hated the boy.

Perhaps he should also have a good Egyptians - no, he thanked him. This Egyptian Art, the heck
out of the professor so much that he had inspected often enough in the Old Museum - curious how
he was curious about everything foreign. If she had not the least - he was quite blankly before the Titans
- the strange gods smile fixed only infuriated him. What they had so smile, far beyond the world and all
its oppressive wonderful beauty! He wanted to smash it, cut up, all together, barbaric in his young
destructiveness because it offended their rest, their grandeur, their strict style to rage. The eye
of his foals on the palace lawn was more to him than all the strict gods and kings, as Amenophis with the
over-refined witty and sickly face and the nobility of his princess's daughters. As the pupil of the animal
in wet blue in the milk of the Black Iris floated - as the creature could see him - so stupid and innocent
... Was not that a scream ... nice? And strangely clumsy soft horse's mouth with the big NÃ¼sterlÃ¶chern about
the delicate pink at their edges ... God - - that strangeness of form and color in a damp foal foot
- in a floating animal eye.

No, really, he would put up a fight against anything that was not of joy, of happiness from himself!
The frenzied admiration of the most peculiar sensation that beat
sky-high in the air ... and to no other!

And if it should become enemies with the most wonderful man in all eternity. In it, the battle
raged around his own becoming, and who was really wild and hard enough! Just can not cheat - not of
love and respect! Did it hurt that could have been yelling, but it was just German fighters and swallowed
his pain. * * * * * Mrs. Martha scolded her son.
 As a child he had often imagined that he would
kill his father - that this skill as a dark necessity hovering over him. And he had always imagined
how it would happen. He looked for the first Rolfers face and raise the dagger - horrible, short,
violent, beautiful ... Now he had only to poison him injected, according to the defenseless,
like a cowardly woman. Community - wicked ...

- His passion was shaken unruly heart of infinite compassion. At this time he had forfeited the esteem of the professor. There
would be no chance of forgiveness. Richard could never himself, and this would alwasy stand
between them. This hurt more than he could ever have imagined. A volatile, very small token of affection, confidence, let her
live for days in happy silence that few would know. She sought her
own rare sacrifice.

Franz Rolfers probably saw the change and would have mixed feelings
about it.
