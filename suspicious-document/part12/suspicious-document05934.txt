For the close of Henry the Eighth's reign as for the reigns of Edward and Mary we possess copious
materials. Strype covers this period in his "Memorials" and in his lives of Cranmer, Cheke,
and Smith; Hayward's "Life of Edward the Sixth" may be supplemented by the young king's own
Journal; "Machyn's Diary" gives us the aspect of affairs as they presented themselves to a
common Englishman; while Holinshed is near enough to serve as a contemporary authority. The
troubled period of the Protectorate is illustrated by Mr. Tytler in the correspondence which
he has published in his "England under Edward the Sixth and Mary," while much light is thrown
on its close by Mr. Nicholls in the "Chronicle of Queen Jane," published by the Camden Society.
In spite of countless errors, of Puritan prejudices, and some deliberate suppressions of the
truth, its mass of facts and wonderful charm of style will always give importance to the "Acts

outer observers, the Venetian Soranzo throws some light on the Protectorate; and the despatches
of Giovanni Michiel, published by Mr. Friedmann, give us a new insight into the events of Mary's
reign.

For the succeeding reign we have a valuable contemporary account in Camden's "Life of Elizabeth."
The "Annals" of Sir John Hayward refer to the first four years of the Queen's rule. Its political
and diplomatic side is only now being fully unveiled in the Calendar of State Papers for this
period, which are being issued by the Master of the Rolls, and fresh light has yet to be looked
for from the Cecil Papers and the documents at Simancas, some of which are embodied in the
history of this reign by Mr. Froude. Among the published materials for this time we have the
Burleigh Papers, the Sidney Papers, the Sadler State Papers, much correspondence in the Hardwicke

CHAPTER I

THE PROTESTANT REVOLUTION

1540-1553

[Sidenote: Cromwell and the Monarchy.]

At the death of Cromwell the success of his policy was complete. The Monarchy had reached the
height of its power. The old liberties of England lay prostrate at the feet of the king. The
Lords were cowed and spiritless; the House of Commons was filled with the creatures of the
Court and degraded into an engine of tyranny. Royal proclamations were taking the place of
parliamentary legislation; royal benevolences were encroaching more and more on the right of
parliamentary taxation. Justice was prostituted in the ordinary courts to the royal will, while
the boundless and arbitrary powers of the royal Council were gradually superseding the slower
processes of the Common Law. The religious changes had thrown an almost sacred character over
the "majesty" of the king. Henry was the Head of the Church. From the primate to the meanest
deacon every minister of it derived from him his sole right to exercise spiritual powers. The
voice of its preachers was the echo of his will. He alone could define orthodoxy or declare
heresy. The forms of its worship and belief were changed and rechanged at the royal caprice.
Half of its wealth went to swell the royal treasury, and the other half lay at the king's mercy.
It was this unprecedented concentration of all power in the hands of a single man that overawed
the imagination of Henry's subjects. He was regarded as something high above the laws which
govern common men. The voices of statesmen and priests extolled his wisdom and authority as
more than human. The Parliament itself rose and bowed to the vacant throne when his name was
mentioned. An absolute devotion to his person replaced the old loyalty to the law. When the
Primate of the English Church described the chief merit of Cromwell, it was by asserting that
he loved the king "no less than he loved God."

[Sidenote: Cromwell and the Parliament.]

It was indeed Cromwell who more than any man had reared this fabric of king-worship. But he
had hardly reared it when it began to give way. The very success of his measures indeed brought
about the ruin of his policy. One of the most striking features of Cromwell's system had been
his developement of parliamentary action. The great assembly which the Monarchy had dreaded
and silenced from the days of Edward the Fourth to the days of Wolsey had been called to the
front again at the Cardinal's fall. Proud of his popularity, and conscious of his people's
sympathy with him in his protest against a foreign jurisdiction, Henry set aside the policy
of the Crown to deal a heavier blow at the Papacy. Both the parties represented in the ministry
that followed Wolsey welcomed the change, for the nobles represented by Norfolk and the men
of the New Learning represented by More regarded Parliament with the same favour. More indeed
in significant though almost exaggerated phrases set its omnipotence face to face with the
growing despotism of the Crown. The policy of Cromwell fell in with this revival of the two
Houses. The daring of his temper led him not to dread and suppress national institutions, but
to seize them and master them, and to turn them into means of enhancing the royal power. As
he saw in the Church a means of raising the king into the spiritual ruler of the faith and
consciences of his people, so he saw in the Parliament a means of shrouding the boldest aggressions
of the monarchy under the veil of popular assent, and of giving to the most ruthless acts of
despotism the stamp and semblance of law. He saw nothing to fear in a House of Lords whose
nobles cowered helpless before the might of the Crown, and whose spiritual members his policy
was degrading into mere tools of the royal will. Nor could he find anything to dread in a House
of Commons which was crowded with members directly or indirectly nominated by the royal Council.
With a Parliament such as this Cromwell might well trust to make the nation itself through
its very representatives an accomplice in the work of absolutism.

[Sidenote: Growth of Parliamentary power.]

His trust seemed more than justified by the conduct of the Houses. It was by parliamentary
statutes that the Church was prostrated at the feet of the Monarchy. It was by bills of attainder
that great nobles were brought to the block. It was under constitutional forms that freedom
was gagged with new treasons and oaths and questionings. One of the first bills of Cromwell's
Parliaments freed Henry from the need of paying his debts, one of the last gave his proclamations
the force of laws. In the action of the two Houses the Crown seemed to have discovered a means
of carrying its power into regions from which a bare despotism has often had to shrink. Henry
might have dared single-handed to break with Rome or to send Sir Thomas More to the block.
But without Parliament to back him he could hardly have ventured on such an enormous confiscation
of property as was involved in the suppression of the monasteries or on such changes in the
national religion as were brought about by the Ten Articles and the Six. It was this discovery
of the use to which the Houses could be turned that accounts for the immense developement of
their powers, the immense widening of their range of action, which they owe to Cromwell. Now
that the great engine was at his own command, he used it as it had never been used before.
Instead of rare and short assemblies of Parliament, England saw it gathered year after year.
All the jealousy with which the Crown had watched its older encroachments on the prerogative
was set aside. Matters which had even in the days of their greatest influence been scrupulously
withheld from the cognizance of the Houses were now absolutely forced on their attention. It
was by Parliament that England was torn from the great body of Western Christendom. It was
by parliamentary enactment that the English Church was reft of its older liberties and made
absolutely subservient to the Crown. It was a parliamentary statute that defined the very faith
and religion of the land. The vastest confiscation of landed property which England had ever
witnessed was wrought by Parliament. It regulated the succession to the throne. It decided
on the validity of the king's marriages and the legitimacy of the king's children. Former sovereigns
had struggled against the claim of the Houses to meddle with the royal ministers or with members
of the royal household. Now Parliament was called on by the king himself to attaint his ministers
and his Queens.

[Sidenote: The New Nobles.]

The fearlessness and completeness of such a policy as this brings home to us more than any
other of his plans the genius of Cromwell. But its success depended wholly on the absolute
servility of Parliament to the will of the Crown, and Cromwell's own action made the continuance
of such a servility impossible. The part which the Houses were to play in after years shows
the importance of clinging to the forms of constitutional freedom, even when their life is
all but lost. In the inevitable reaction against tyranny they furnish centres for the reviving
energies of the people, while the returning tide of liberty is enabled through their preservation
to flow quietly and naturally along its traditional channels. And even before Cromwell passed
to his doom the tide of liberty was returning. On one occasion during his rule a "great debate"
on the suppression of the lesser monasteries showed that elements of resistance still survived;
and these elements developed rapidly as the power of the Crown declined under the minority
of Edward and the unpopularity of Mary. To this revival of a spirit of independence the spoliation
of the Church largely contributed. Partly from necessity, partly from a desire to build up
a faction interested in the maintenance of their ecclesiastical policy, Cromwell and the king
squandered the vast mass of wealth which flowed into the Treasury from the dissolution of the
monasteries with reckless prodigality. Three hundred and seventy-six smaller houses had been
suppressed in 1536; six hundred and forty-five greater houses were surrendered or seized in
1539. Some of the spoil was devoted to the erection of six new bishopricks; a larger part went
to the fortification of the coast. But the bulk of these possessions was granted lavishly away
to the nobles and courtiers about the king, and to a host of adventurers who "had become gospellers
for the abbey lands." Something like a fifth of the actual land in the kingdom was in this
way transferred from the holding of the Church to that of nobles and gentry. Not only were
the older houses enriched, but a new aristocracy was erected from among the dependants of the
Court. The Russells and the Cavendishes are familiar instances of families which rose from
obscurity through the enormous grants of Church-land made to Henry's courtiers. The old baronage
was thus hardly crushed before a new aristocracy took its place. "Those families within or
without the bounds of the peerage," observes Mr. Hallam, "who are now deemed the most considerable,
will be found, with no great number of exceptions, to have first become conspicuous under the
Tudor line of kings and, if we could trace the title of their estates, to have acquired no
small portion of them mediately or immediately from monastic or other ecclesiastical foundations."
The leading part which these freshly-created peers took in the events which followed Henry's
death gave strength and vigour to the whole order. But the smaller gentry shared in the general
enrichment of the landed proprietors, and the new energy of the Lords was soon followed by
a display of political independence among the Commons themselves.

[Sidenote: Results of the Religious Changes.]

While the prodigality of Cromwell's system thus brought into being a new check upon the Crown
by enriching the nobles and the lesser gentry, the religious changes it brought about gave
fire and vigour to the elements of opposition which were slowly gathering. What did most to
ruin the king-worship that Cromwell set up was Cromwell's ecclesiastical policy. In reducing
the Church to mere slavery beneath the royal power he believed himself to be trampling down
the last constitutional force which could hold the Monarchy in check. What he really did was
to give life and energy to new forces which were bound from their very nature to battle with
the Monarchy for even more than the old English freedom. When Cromwell seized on the Church
he held himself to be seizing for the Crown the mastery which the Church had wielded till now
over the consciences and reverence of men. But the very humiliation of the great religious
body broke the spell beneath which Englishmen had bowed. In form nothing had been changed.
The outer constitution of the Church remained utterly unaltered. The English bishop, freed
from the papal control, freed from the check of monastic independence, seemed greater and more
imposing than ever. The priest still clung to rectory and church. If images were taken out
of churches, if here and there a rood-loft was pulled down or a saint's shrine demolished,
no change was made in form of ritual or mode of worship. The mass was untouched. Every hymn,
every prayer, was still in Latin; confession, penance, fastings and feastings, extreme unction,
went on as before. There was little to show that any change had taken place; and yet every
ploughman felt that all was changed. The bishop, gorgeous as he might be in mitre and cope,
was a mere tool of the king. The priest was trembling before heretics he used to burn. Farmer
or shopkeeper might enter their church any Sunday morning to find mass or service utterly transformed.
The spell of tradition, of unbroken continuance, was over; and with it the power which the
Church had wielded over the souls of men was in great part done away.

It was not that the new Protestantism was as yet formidable, for, violent and daring as they
were, the adherents of Luther were few in number, and drawn mostly from the poorer classes
among whom Wyclifite heresy had lingered or from the class of scholars whose theological studies
drew their sympathy to the movement over sea. It was that the lump was now ready to be leavened
by this petty leaven, that men's hold on the firm ground of custom was broken and their minds
set drifting and questioning, that little as was the actual religious change, the thought of
religious change had become familiar to the people as a whole. And with religious change was
certain to come religious revolt. The human conscience was hardly likely to move everywhere
in strict time to the slow advance of Henry's reforms. Men who had been roused from implicit
obedience to the Papacy as a revelation of the Divine will by hearing the Pope denounced in
royal proclamations as a usurper and an impostor were hardly inclined to take up submissively
the new official doctrine which substituted implicit belief in the King for implicit belief
in the "Bishop of Rome." But bound as Church and King now were together, it was impossible
to deny a tenet of the one without entering on a course of opposition to the other. Cromwell
had raised against the Monarchy the most fatal of all enemies, the force of the individual
conscience, the enthusiasm of religious belief, the fire of religious fanaticism. Slowly as
the area of the new Protestantism extended, every man that it gained was a possible opponent
of the Crown. And should the time come, as the time was soon to come, when the Crown moved
to the side of Protestantism, then in turn every soul that the older faith retained was pledged
to a lifelong combat with the Monarchy.

[Sidenote: The Imperial Alliance.]

How irresistible was the national drift was seen on Cromwell's fall. Its first result indeed
promised to be a reversal of all that Cromwell had done. Norfolk returned to power, and his
influence over Henry seemed secured by the king's repudiation of Anne of Cleves and his marriage
in the summer of 1540 to a niece of the Duke, Catharine Howard. But Norfolk's temper had now
become wholly hostile to the movement about him. "I never read the Scripture nor never will!"
the Duke replied hotly to a Protestant arguer. "It was merry in England afore the new learning
came up; yea, I would all things were as hath been in times past." In his preference of an
Imperial alliance to an alliance with Francis and the Lutherans Henry went warmly with his
minister. Parted as he had been from Charles by the question of the divorce, the King's sympathies
had remained true to the Emperor; and at this moment he was embittered against France by the
difficulties it threw in the way of his projects for gaining a hold upon Scotland. Above all
the king still clung to the hope of a purification of the Church by a Council, as well as of
a reconciliation of England with the general body of this purified Christendom, and it was
only by the Emperor that such a Council could be convened or such a reconciliation brought
about. An alliance with him was far from indicating any retreat from Henry's position of independence
or any submission to the Papacy. To the men of his own day Charles seemed no Catholic bigot.
On the contrary the stricter representatives of Catholicism such as Paul the Fourth denounced
him as a patron of heretics, and attributed the upgrowth of Lutheranism to his steady protection
and encouragement. Nor was the charge without seeming justification. The old jealousy between
Pope and Emperor, the more recent hostility between them as rival Italian powers, had from
the beginning proved Luther's security. At the first appearance of the reformer Maximilian
had recommended the Elector of Saxony to suffer no harm to be done to him; "there might come
a time," said the old Emperor, "when he would be needed." Charles had looked on the matter
mainly in the same political way. In his earliest years he bought Leo's aid in his recovery
of Milan from the French king by issuing the ban of the Empire against Luther in the Diet of
Worms; but every Italian held that in suffering the reformer to withdraw unharmed Charles had
shown not so much regard to his own safe-conduct as a purpose still "to keep the Pope in check
with that rein." And as Charles dealt with Luther so he dealt with Lutheranism. The new faith
profited by the Emperor's struggle with Clement the Seventh for the lordship over Italy. It
was in the midst of this struggle that his brother and representative, Ferdinand, signed in
the Diet of Spires an Imperial decree by which the German States were left free to arrange
their religious affairs "as each should best answer to God and the Emperor." The decree gave
a legal existence to the Protestant body in the Empire which it never afterwards lost.

[Sidenote: Charles and the Council.]

Such a step might well encourage the belief that Charles was himself inclining to Lutheranism;
and the belief gathered strength as he sent Lutheran armies over the Alps to sack Rome and
to hold the Pope a prisoner. The belief was a false one, for Charles remained utterly untouched
by the religious movement about him; but even when his strife with the Papacy was to a great
extent lulled by Clement's submission, he still turned a deaf ear to the Papal appeals for
dealing with Lutheranism by fire and sword. His political interests and the conception which
he held of his duty as Emperor alike swayed him to milder counsels. He purposed indeed to restore
religious unity. His political aim was to bring Germany to his feet as he had brought Italy;
and he saw that the religious schism was the great obstacle in the way of his realizing this
design. As the temporal head of the Catholic world he was still more strongly bent to heal
the breaches of Catholicism. But he had no wish to insist on an unconditional submission to
the Papacy. He believed that there were evils to be cured on the one side as on the other;
and Charles saw the high position which awaited him if as Emperor he could bring about a reformation
of the Church and a reunion of Christendom. Violent as Luther's words had been, the Lutheran
princes and the bulk of Lutheran theologians had not yet come to look on Catholicism as an
irreconcileable foe. Even on the papal side there was a learned and active party, a party headed
by Contarini and Pole, whose theological sympathies went in many points with the Lutherans,
and who looked to the winning back of the Lutherans as the needful prelude to any reform in
the doctrine and practice of the Church; while Melancthon was as hopeful as Contarini that
such a reform might be wrought and the Church again become universal. In his proposal of a
Council to carry on the double work of purification and reunion therefore Charles stood out
as the representative of the larger part both of the Catholic and the Protestant world. Against
such a proposal however Rome struggled hard. All her tradition was against Councils, where
the assembled bishops had in earlier days asserted their superiority to the Pope, and where
the Emperor who convened the assembly and carried out its decrees rose into dangerous rivalry
with the Papacy. Crushed as he was, Clement the Seventh throughout his lifetime held the proposal
of a Council stubbornly at bay. But under his successor, Paul the Third, the influence of Contarini
and the moderate Catholics secured a more favourable reception of plans of reconciliation.
In April, 1541, conferences for this purpose were in fact opened at Augsburg in which Contarini,
as Papal legate, accepted a definition of the moot question of justifications by faith which
satisfied Bucer and Melancthon. On the other side, the Landgrave of Hesse and the Elector of
Brandenburg publicly declared that they believed it possible to come to terms on the yet more
vexed questions of the Mass and the Papal supremacy.

[Sidenote: Charles and Henry.]

Never had the reunion of the world seemed so near; and the hopes that were stirring found an
echo in England as well as in Germany. We can hardly doubt indeed that it was the revival of
these hopes which had brought about the fall of Cromwell and the recall of Norfolk to power.
Norfolk, like his master, looked to a purification of the Church by a Council as the prelude
to a reconciliation of England with the general body of Catholicism; and both saw that it was
by the influence of the Emperor alone that such a Council could be brought about. Charles on
the other hand was ready to welcome Henry's advances. The quarrel over Catharine had ended
with her death; and the wrong done her had been in part atoned for by the fall of Anne Boleyn.
The aid of Henry too was needed to hold in check the opposition of France. The chief means
which France still possessed of holding the Emperor at bay lay in the disunion of the Empire,
and it was resolute to preserve this weapon against him at whatever cost to Christendom. While
Francis remonstrated at Rome against the concessions made to the Lutherans by the Legates,
he urged the Lutheran princes to make no terms with the Papacy. To the Protestants he held
out hopes of his own conversion, while he promised Pope Paul that he would defend him with
his life against Emperor and heretics. His intrigues were aided by the suspicions of both the
religious parties. Luther refused to believe in the sincerity of the concessions made by the
Legates; Paul the Third held aloof from them in sullen silence. Meanwhile Francis was preparing
to raise more material obstacles to the Emperor's designs. Charles had bought his last reconciliation
with the king by a promise of restoring the Milanese, but he had no serious purpose of ever
fulfilling his pledge, and his retention of the Duchy gave the French king a fair pretext for
threatening a renewal of the war.

[Sidenote: James the Fifth.]

England, as Francis hoped, he could hold in check through his alliance with the Scots. After
the final expulsion of Albany in 1524 Scottish history became little more than a strife between
Margaret Tudor and her husband, the Earl of Angus, for power; but the growth of James the Fifth
to manhood at last secured rest for the land. James had all the varied ability of his race,
and he carried out with vigour its traditional policy. The Highland chieftains, the great lords
of the Lowlands, were brought more under the royal sway; the Church was strengthened to serve
as a check on the feudal baronage; the alliance with France was strictly preserved, as the
one security against English aggression. Nephew as he was indeed of the English king, James
from the outset of his reign took up an attitude hostile to England. He was jealous of the
influence which the two Henries had established in his realm by the marriage of Margaret and
by the building up of an English party under the Douglases; the great Churchmen who formed
his most trusted advisers dreaded the influence of the religious changes across the border;
while the people clung to their old hatred of England and their old dependence on France. It
was only by two inroads of the border lords that Henry checked the hostile intrigues of James
in 1532; his efforts to influence his nephew by an interview and alliance were met by the king's
marriage with two French wives in succession, Magdalen of Valois, a daughter of Francis, and
Mary, a daughter of the Duke of Guise. In 1539 when the projected coalition between France
and the Empire threatened England, it had been needful to send Norfolk with an army to the
Scotch frontier, and now that France was again hostile Norfolk had to move anew to the border
in the autumn of 1541.

[Sidenote: Defeat at the Solway.]

While the Duke was fruitlessly endeavouring to bring James to fresh friendship a sudden blow
at home weakened his power. At the close of the year Catharine Howard was arrested on a charge
of adultery; a Parliament which assembled in January 1542 passed a Bill of Attainder; and in
February the Queen was sent to the block. She was replaced by the widow of Lord Latimer, Catharine
Parr; and the influence of Norfolk in the king's counsels gradually gave way to that of Bishop
Gardiner of Winchester. But Henry clung to the policy which the Duke favoured. At the end of
1541 two great calamities, the loss of Hungary after a victory of the Turks and a crushing
defeat at Algiers, so weakened Charles that in the summer of the following year Francis ventured
to attack him. The attack served only to draw closer the negotiations between England and the
Emperor; and Francis was forced, as he had threatened, to give Henry work to occupy him at
home. The busiest counsellor of the Scotch king, Cardinal Beaton, crossed the seas to negotiate
a joint attack, and the attitude of Scotland became so menacing that in the autumn of 1542
Norfolk was again sent to the border with twenty thousand men. But terrible as were his ravages,
he could not bring the Scotch army to an engagement, and want of supplies soon forced him to
fall back over the border. It was in vain that James urged his nobles to follow him in a counter-invasion.
They were ready to defend their country; but the memory of Flodden was still fresh, and success
in England would only give dangerous strength to a king in whom they saw an enemy. But James
was as stubborn in his purpose as the lords. Anxious only to free himself from their presence,
he waited till the two armies had alike withdrawn, and then suddenly summoned his subjects
to meet him in arms on the western border. A disorderly host gathered at Lochmaben and passed
into Cumberland; but the English borderers followed on them fast, and were preparing to attack
when at nightfall on the twenty-fifth of November a panic seized the whole Scotch force. Lost
in the darkness and cut off from retreat by the Solway Firth, thousands of men with all the
baggage and guns fell into the hands of the pursuers. The news of this rout fell on the young
king like a sentence of death. For a while he wandered desperately from palace to palace till
at the opening of December the tidings met him at Falkland that his queen, Mary of Guise, had
given birth to a child. His two boys had both died in youth, and he was longing passionately
for an heir to the crown which was slipping from his grasp. But the child was a daughter, the
Mary Stuart of later history. "The deil go with it," muttered the dying king, as his mind fell
back to the close of the line of Bruce and the marriage with Robert's daughter which brought
the Stuarts to the Scottish throne, "The deil go with it! It will end as it began. It came
with a lass, and it will go with a lass." A few days later he died.

[Sidenote: The Marriage Treaty.]

The death of James did more than remove a formidable foe. It opened up for the first time a
prospect of that union of the two kingdoms which was at last to close their long hostility.
Scotland, torn by factions and with a babe for queen, seemed to lie at Henry's feet: and the
king seized the opportunity of completing his father's work by a union of the realms. At the
opening of 1543 he proposed to the Scotch regent, the Earl of Arran, the marriage of the infant
Mary Stuart with his son Edward. To ensure this bridal he demanded that Mary should at once
be sent to England, the four great fortresses of Scotland be placed in English hands, and a
voice given to Henry himself in the administration of the Scotch Council of Regency. Arran
and the Queen-mother, rivals as they were, vied with each other in apparent goodwill to the
marriage; but there was a steady refusal to break the league with France, and the "English
lords," as the Douglas faction were called, owned themselves helpless in the face of the national
jealousy of English ambition. The temper of the nation itself was seen in the answer made by
the Scotch Parliament which gathered in the spring. If they consented to the young Queen's
betrothal, they not only rejected the demands which accompanied the proposal, but insisted
that in case of such a union Scotland should have a perpetual regent of its own, and that this
office should be hereditary in the House of Arran. Warned by his very partizans that the delivery
of Mary was impossible, that if such a demand were pressed "there was not so little a boy but
he would hurl stones against it, the wives would handle their distaffs, and the commons would
universally die in it," Henry's proposals dropped in July to a treaty of alliance, offensive
and defensive, he suffered France to be included among the allies of Scotland named in it,
he consented that the young Queen should remain with her mother till the age of ten, and offered
guarantees for the maintenance of Scotch independence.

[Sidenote: Scotland and France.]

But modify it as he might, Henry knew that such a project of union could only be carried out
by a war with Francis. His negotiations for a treaty with Charles had long been delayed through
Henry's wish to drag the Emperor into an open breach with the Papacy, but at the moment of
the King's first proposals for the marriage of Mary Stuart with his son the need of finding
a check upon France forced on a formal alliance with the Emperor in February 1543. The two
allies agreed that the war should be continued till the Duchy of Burgundy had been restored
to the Emperor and till England had recovered Normandy and Guienne; while the joint fleets
of Henry and Charles held the Channel and sheltered England from any danger of French attack.
The main end of this treaty was doubtless to give Francis work at home which might prevent
the despatch of a French force into Scotland and the overthrow of Henry's hopes of a Scotch
marriage. These hopes were strengthened as the summer went on by the acceptance of his later
proposals in a Parliament which was packed by the Regent, and by the actual conclusion of a
marriage-treaty. But if Francis could spare neither horse nor man for action in Scotland his
influence in the northern kingdom was strong enough to foil Henry's plans. The Churchmen were
as bitterly opposed to such a marriage as the partizans of France; and their head, Cardinal
Beaton, who had held aloof from the Regent's Parliament, suddenly seized the Queen-mother and
her babe, crowned the infant Mary, called a Parliament in December which annulled the marriage-treaty,
and set Henry at defiance.

[Sidenote: War with France.]

The king's wrath at this overthrow of his hopes showed itself in a brutal and impolitic act
of vengeance. He was a skilful shipbuilder; and among the many enterprises which the restless
genius of Cromwell undertook there was probably none in which Henry took so keen an interest
as in his creation of an English fleet. Hitherto merchant ships had been impressed when a fleet
was needed; but the progress of naval warfare had made the maintenance of an armed force at
sea a condition of maritime power, and the resources furnished by the dissolution of the abbeys
had been devoted in part to the building of ships of war, the largest of which, the Mary Rose,
carried a crew of seven hundred men. The new strength which England was to wield in its navy
was first seen in 1544. An army was gathered under Lord Hertford; and while Scotland was looking
for the usual advance over the border the Earl's forces were quietly put on board and the English
fleet appeared on the third of May in the Firth of Forth. The surprise made resistance impossible.
Leith was seized and sacked, Edinburgh, then a town of wooden houses, was given to the flames,
and burned for three days and three nights. The country for seven miles round was harried into
a desert. The blow was a hard one, but it was little likely to bring Scotchmen round to Henry's
projects of union. A brutal raid of the English borderers on Melrose and the destruction of
his ancestors' tombs estranged the Earl of Angus, and was quickly avenged by his overthrow
of the marauders at Ancrum Moor. Henry had yet to learn the uselessness of mere force to compass
his ends. "I shall be glad to serve the king of England, with my honour," said the Lord of
Buccleugh to an English envoy, "but I will not be constrained thereto if all Teviotdale be
burned to the bottom of hell."

Hertford's force returned in good time to join the army which Henry in person was gathering
at Calais to co-operate with the forces assembled by Charles on the north-eastern frontier
of France. Each sovereign found himself at the head of forty thousand men, and the Emperor's
military ability was seen in his proposal for an advance of both armies upon Paris. But though
Henry found no French force in his front, his cautious temper shrank from the risk of leaving
fortresses in his rear; and while their allies pushed boldly past Châlons on the capital, the
English troops were detained till September in the capture of Boulogne, and only left Boulogne
to form the siege of Montreuil. The French were thus enabled to throw their whole force on
the Emperor, and Charles found himself in a position from which negotiation alone could extricate
him.

[Sidenote: Growth of Lutheranism.]

His ends were in fact gained by the humiliation of France, and he had as little desire to give
England a strong foothold in the neighbourhood of his own Netherlands as in Wolsey's days.
The widening of English territory there could hardly fail to encourage that upgrowth of heresy
which the Emperor justly looked upon as the greatest danger to the hold of Spain upon the Low
Countries, while it would bring Henry a step nearer to the chain of Protestant states which
began on the Lower Rhine. The plans which Charles had formed for uniting the Catholics and
Lutherans in the conferences of Augsburg had broken down before the opposition both of Luther
and the Pope. On both sides indeed the religious contest was gathering new violence. A revival
had begun in the Church itself, but it was the revival of a militant and uncompromising orthodoxy.
In 1542 the fanaticism of Cardinal Caraffa forced on the establishment of a supreme Tribunal
of the Inquisition at Rome. The next year saw the establishment of the Jesuits. Meanwhile Lutheranism
took a new energy. The whole north of Germany became Protestant. In 1539 the younger branches
of the house of Saxony joined the elder in a common adherence to Lutheranism; and their conversion
had been followed by that of the Elector of Brandenburg. Southern Germany seemed bent on following
the example of the north. The hereditary possessions of Charles himself fell away from Catholicism.
The Austrian duchies were overrun with heresy. Bohemia promised soon to become Hussite again.
Persecution failed to check the triumph of the new opinions in the Low Countries. The Empire
itself threatened to become Protestant. In 1540 the accession of the Elector Palatine robbed
Catholicism of Central Germany and the Upper Rhine; and three years later, at the opening of
the war with France, that of the Archbishop of Koln gave the Protestants not only the Central
Rhineland but a majority in the College of Electors. It seemed impossible for Charles to prevent
the Empire from repudiating Catholicism in his lifetime, or to hinder the Imperial Crown from
falling to a Protestant at his death.

[Sidenote: England and France.]

The great fabric of power which had been built up by the policy of Ferdinand of Aragon was
thus threatened with utter ruin, and Charles saw himself forced into the struggle he had so
long avoided, if not for the interests of religion, at any rate for the interests of the House
of Austria. He still hoped for a reunion from the Council which was assembling at Trent, and
from which a purified Catholicism was to come. But he no longer hoped that the Lutherans would
yield to the mere voice of the Council. They would yield only to force, and the first step
in such a process of compulsion must be the breaking up of their League of Schmalkald. Only
France could save them; and it was to isolate them from France that Charles availed himself
of the terror his march on Paris had caused, and concluded a treaty with that power in September
1544. The progress of Protestantism had startled even France itself; and her old policy seemed
to be abandoned in her promises of co-operation in the task of repressing heresy in the Empire.
But a stronger security against French intervention lay in the unscrupulous dexterity with
which, while withdrawing from the struggle, Charles left Henry and Francis still at strife.
Henry would not cede Boulogne, and Francis saw no means of forcing him to a peace save by a
threat of invasion. While an army closed round Boulogne, and a squadron carried troops to Scotland,
a hundred and fifty French ships were gathered in the Channel and crossed in the summer of
1545 to the Isle of Wight. But their attacks were feebly conducted and the fleet at last returned
to its harbours without striking any serious blow, while the siege of Boulogne dragged idly
on through the year. Both kings however drew to peace. In spite of the treaty of Crépy it was
impossible for France to abandon the Lutherans, and Francis was eager to free his hands for
action across the Rhine. Henry on the other hand, deserted by his ally and with a treasury
ruined by the cost of the war, was ready at last to surrender his gains in it. In June 1546
a peace was concluded by which England engaged to surrender Boulogne on payment of a heavy
ransom, and France to restore the annual subsidy which had been promised in 1525.

[Sidenote: The Peace.]

What aided in the close of the war was a new aspect of affairs in Scotland. Since the death
of James the Fifth the great foe of England in the north had been the Archbishop of St. Andrews,
Cardinal Beaton. In despair of shaking his power his rivals had proposed schemes for his assassination
to Henry, and these schemes had been expressly approved. But plot after plot broke down; and
it was not till May 1546 that a group of Scotch nobles who favoured the Reformation surprised
his castle at St. Andrews. Shrieking miserably, "I am a priest! I am a priest! Fie! Fie! All
is gone!" the Cardinal was brutally murdered, and his body hung over the castle-walls. His
death made it easy to include Scotland in the peace with France which was concluded in the
summer. But in England itself peace was a necessity. The Crown was penniless. In spite of the
confiscation of the abbey lands in 1539 the treasury was found empty at the very opening of
the war: the large subsidies granted by the Parliament were expended; and conscious that a
fresh grant could hardly be expected even from the servile Houses the government in 1545 fell
back on its old resource of benevolences. Of two London merchants who resisted this demand
as illegal one was sent to the Fleet, the second ordered to join the army on the Scotch border;
but it was significant that resistance had been offered, and the failure of the war-taxes which
were voted at the close of the year to supply the royal needs drove the Council to fresh acts
of confiscation. A vast mass of Church property still remained for the spoiler, and by a bill
of 1545 more than two thousand chauntries and chapels, with a hundred and ten hospitals, were
suppressed to the profit of the Crown. Enormous as this booty was, it could only be slowly
realized; and the immediate pressure forced the Council to take refuge in the last and worst
measure any government can adopt, a debasement of the currency. The evils of such a course
were felt till the reign of Elizabeth. But it was a course that could not be repeated; and
financial exhaustion played its part in bringing the war to an end.

[Sidenote: Charles and the League of Schmalkald.]

A still greater part was played by the aspect of affairs in the Empire. Once freed from the
check of the war Charles had moved fast to his aim. In 1545 he had adjusted all minor differences
with Paul the Third, and Pope and Emperor had resolved on the immediate convocation of the
Council, and on the enforcement of its decisions by weight of arms. Should the Emperor be driven
to war with the Lutheran princes, the Pope engaged to support him with all his power. "Were
it needful" Paul promised "he would sell his very crown in his service." In December the Council
was actually opened at Trent, and its proceedings soon showed that no concessions to the Lutherans
could be looked for. The Emperor's demand that the reform of the Church should first be taken
in hand was evaded; and on the two great questions of the authority of the Bible as a ground
of faith, and of justification, the sentence of the Council directly condemned the Protestant
opinions. The Lutherans showed their resolve to make no submission by refusing to send representatives
to Trent; and Charles carried out his pledges to the Papacy by taking the field in the spring
of 1546 to break up the League of Schmalkald. But the army gathered under the Elector of Saxony
and the Landgrave of Hesse so far outnumbered the Imperial forces that the Emperor could not
venture on a battle. Henry watched the course of Charles with a growing anxiety. The hopes
of a purified and united Christendom which had drawn him a few years back to the Emperor's
side faded before the stern realities of the Council. The highest pretensions of the Papacy
had been sanctioned by the bishops gathered at Trent; and to the pretensions of the Papacy
Henry was resolved not to bow. He was driven, whether he would or no, on the policy of Cromwell;
and in the last months of his life he offered aid to the League of Schmalkald. His offers were
rejected; for the Lutheran princes had no faith in his sincerity, and believed themselves strong
enough to deal with the Emperor without foreign help.

[Sidenote: Effect on English Religion.]

But his attitude without told on his policy at home. To the hotter Catholics as to the hotter
Protestants the years since Cromwell's fall had seemed years of a gradual return to Catholicism.
There had been a slight sharpening of persecution for the Protestants, and restrictions had
been put on the reading of the English Bible. The alliance with Charles and the hope of reconciling
England anew with a pacified Christendom gave fresh cause for suppressing heresy. Neither Norfolk
nor his master indeed desired any rigorous measure of reaction, for Henry remained proud of
the work he had done. His bitterness against the Papacy only grew as the years went by; and
at the very moment that heretics were suffering for a denial of the mass, others were suffering
by their side for a denial of the supremacy. But strange and anomalous as its system seemed,
the drift of Henry's religious government had as yet been in one direction, that of a return
to and reconciliation with the body of the Catholic Church. With the decision of the Council
and the new attitude of the Emperor this drift was suddenly arrested. It was not that Henry
realized the revolution that was opening before him or the vast importance of the steps which
his policy now led him to take. His tendency, like that of his people, was religious rather
than theological, practical rather than speculative. Of the immense problems which were opening
in the world neither he nor England saw anything. The religious strife which was to break Europe
asunder was to the king as to the bulk of Englishmen a quarrel of words and hot temper; the
truth which Christendom was to rend itself to pieces in striving to discover was a thing that
could easily be found with the aid of God. There is something humorous as there is something
pathetic in the warnings which Henry addressed to the Parliament at the close of 1545. The
shadow of death as it fell over him gave the king's words a new gentleness and tenderness.
"The special foundation of our religion being charity between man and man, it is so refrigerate
as there never was more dissension and lack of love between man and man, the occasions whereof
are opinions only and names devised for the continuance of the same. Some are called Papists,
some Lutherans, and some Anabaptists; names devised of the devil, and yet not fully without
ground, for the severing of one man's heart by conceit of opinion from the other." But the
remedy was a simple one. Every man was "to travail first for his own amendment." Then the bishops
and clergy were to agree in their teaching, "which, seeing there is but one truth and verity,
they may easily do, calling therein for the grace of God." Then the nobles and laity were to
be pious and humble, to read their new Bibles "reverently and humbly ... and in any doubt to
resort to the learned or at best the higher powers." "I am very sorry to know and hear how
unreverendly that precious jewel, the Word of God, is disputed, rimed, sung, and jangled in
every alehouse and tavern. This kind of man is depraved and that kind of man, this ceremony
and that ceremony." All this controversy might be done away by simple charity. "Therefore be
in charity one with another like brother and brother. Have respect to the pleasing of God;
and then I doubt not that love I spoke of shall never be dissolved between us."

[Sidenote: The Religious Truce.]

There is something wonderful in the English coolness and narrowness, in the speculative blindness
and practical good sense which could look out over such a world at such a moment, and could
see nothing in it save a quarrel of "opinions, and of names devised for the continuance of
the same." But Henry only expressed the general feeling of his people. England indeed was being
slowly leavened with a new spirit. The humiliation of the clergy, the Lutheran tendencies of
half the bishops, the crash of the abbeys, the destruction of chauntries and mass-chapels,
a measure which told closely on the actual worship of the day, the new articles of faith, the
diffusion of Bibles, the "jangling" and discussion which followed on every step in the king's
course, were all telling on the thoughts of men. But the temper of the nation as a whole remained
religiously conservative. It drifted rather to the moderate reforms of the New Learning than
to any radical reconstruction of the Church. There was a general disinclination indeed to push
matters to either extreme, a general shrinking from the persecution which the Catholic called
for as from the destruction which the Protestant was desiring. It was significant that a new
heresy bill which passed through the Lords in 1545 quietly disappeared when it reached the
Commons. But this shrinking rested rather on national than on theological grounds, on a craving
for national union which Henry expressed in his cry for "brotherly love," and on an imperfect
appreciation of the real nature or consequence of the points at issue which made men shrink
from burning their neighbours for "opinions and names devised for the continuance of the same."
What Henry and what the bulk of Englishmen wanted was, not indeed wholly to rest in what had
been done, but to do little more save the remedying of obvious abuses or the carrying on of
obvious improvements. One such improvement was the supplying men with the means of private
devotion in their own tongue, a measure from which none but the fanatics of either side dissented.
This process went slowly on in the issuing of two primers in 1535 and 1539, the rendering into
English of the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, the publication of an English
Litany for outdoor processions in 1544, and the adding to this of a collection of English prayers
in 1545.

[Sidenote: The Court Factions.]

But the very tone of Henry shows his consciousness that this religious truce rested on his
will alone. Around him as he lay dying stood men who were girding themselves to a fierce struggle
for power, a struggle that could not fail to wake the elements of religious discord which he
had striven to lull asleep. Adherents of the Papacy, advocates of a new submission to a foreign
spiritual jurisdiction there were few or none; for the most conservative of English Churchmen
or nobles had as yet no wish to restore the older Roman supremacy. But Norfolk and Gardiner
were content with this assertion of national and ecclesiastical independence; in all matters
of faith they were earnest to conserve, to keep things as they were, and in front of them stood
a group of nobles who were bent on radical change. The marriages, the reforms, the profusion
of Henry had aided him in his policy of weakening the nobles by building up a new nobility
which sprang from the Court and was wholly dependent on the Crown. Such were the Russells,
the Cavendishes, the Wriothesleys, the Fitzwilliams. Such was John Dudley, a son of the Dudley
who had been put to death for his financial oppression in Henry the Seventh's days, but who
had been restored in blood, attached to the court, raised to the peerage as Lord Lisle, and
who, whether as adviser or general, had been actively employed in high stations at the close
of this reign. Such above all were the two brothers of Jane Seymour. The elder of the two,
Edward Seymour, had been raised to the earldom of Hertford, and entrusted with the command
of the English army in its operations against Scotland. As uncle of Henry's boy Edward, he
could not fail to play a leading part in the coming reign; and the nobles of the "new blood,"
as their opponents called them in disdain, drew round him as their head. Without any historical
hold on the country, raised by the royal caprice, and enriched by the spoil of the monasteries,
these nobles were pledged to the changes from which they had sprung and to the party of change.
Over the mass of the nation their influence was small; and in the strife for power with the
older nobles which they were anticipating they were forced to look to the small but resolute
body of men who, whether from religious enthusiasm or from greed of wealth or power, were bent
on bringing the English Church nearer to conformity with the reformed Churches of the Continent.
As Henry drew to his grave the two factions faced each other with gathering dread and gathering
hate. Hot words betrayed their hopes. "If God should call the king to his mercy," said Norfolk's
son, Lord Surrey, "who were so meet to govern the Prince as my lord my father?" "Rather than
it should come to pass," retorted a partizan of Hertford's, "that the Prince should be under
the governance of your father or you, I would abide the adventure to thrust a dagger in you!"

[Sidenote: Lord Surrey.]

In the history of English poetry the name of Lord Surrey takes an illustrious place. The dull
moralizings of the rimers who followed Chaucer, the rough but vivacious doggrel of Skelton,
made way in the hands of Wyatt and Surrey for delicate imitations of the songs, sonnets, and
rondels of Italy and France. With the Italian conceits came an Italian refinement whether of
words or of thought; and the force and versatility of Surrey's youth showed itself in whimsical
satires, in classical translations, in love-sonnets, and in paraphrases of the Psalms. In his
version of two books of the Æneid he was the first to introduce into England the Italian blank
verse which was to play so great a part in our literature. But with the poetic taste of the
Renascence Surrey inherited its wild and reckless energy. Once he was sent to the Fleet for
challenging a gentleman to fight. Release enabled him to join his father in an expedition against
Scotland, but he was no sooner back than the Londoners complained how at Candlemas the young
lord and his comrades "went out with stone bows at midnight," and how next day "there was great
clamour of the breaking of many glass windows both of houses and churches, and shooting at
men that might be in the streets." In spite of his humorous excuse that the jest only purposed
to bring home to men that "from justice' rod no fault is free, but that all such as work unright
in most quiet are next unrest," Surrey paid for this outbreak with a fresh arrest which drove
him to find solace in paraphrases of Ecclesiastes and the Psalms. Soon he was over sea with
the English troops in Flanders, and in 1544 serving as marshal of the camp to conduct the retreat
after the siege of Montreuil. Sent to relieve Boulogne, he remained in charge of the town till
the spring of 1546, when he returned to England to rime sonnets to a fair Geraldine, the daughter
of the Earl of Kildare, and to plunge into the strife of factions around the dying king.

[Sidenote: Fall of the Howards.]

All moral bounds had been loosened by the spirit of the Renascence, and, if we accept the charge
of his rivals, Surrey now aimed at gaining a hold on Henry by offering him his sister as a
mistress. It is as possible that the young Earl was aiming simply at the displacement of Catharine
Parr, and at the renewal by his sister's elevation to the throne of that matrimonial hold upon
Henry which the Howards had already succeeded in gaining through the unions with Anne Boleyn
and Catharine Howard. But a temper such as Surrey's was ill matched against the subtle and
unscrupulous schemers who saw their enemy in a pride that scorned the "new men" about him and
vowed that when once the king was dead "they should smart for it." The turn of foreign affairs
gave a fresh strength to the party which sympathized with the Protestants and denounced that
alliance with the Emperor which had been throughout the policy of the Howards. Henry's offer
of aid to the Lutheran princes marked the triumph of this party in the royal councils; and
the new steps which Cranmer was suffered to make towards an English Liturgy showed that the
religious truce of Henry's later years was at last abandoned. Hertford, the head of the "new
men," came more to the front as the waning health of the king brought Jane Seymour's boy, Edward,
nearer to the throne. In the new reign Hertford, as the boy's uncle, was sure to play a great
part; and he used his new influence to remove the only effective obstacle to his future greatness.
Surrey's talk of his royal blood, the Duke's quartering of the royal arms to mark his Plantagenet
descent, and some secret interviews with the French ambassador, were adroitly used to wake
Henry's jealousy of the dangers which might beset the throne of his child. Norfolk and his
son were alike committed to the Tower at the close of 1546. A month later Surrey was condemned
and sent to the block, and his father was only saved by the sudden death of Henry the Eighth
in January, 1547.

[Sidenote: Hertford made Protector.]

By an Act passed in the Parliament of 1544 it had been provided that the crown should pass
to Henry's son Edward, and on Edward's death without issue to his sister Mary. Should Mary
prove childless it was to go to Elizabeth, the child of Anne Boleyn. Beyond this point the
Houses would make no provision, but power was given to the king to make further dispositions
by will. At his death it was found that Henry had passed over the line of his sister Margaret
of Scotland, and named as next in the succession to Elizabeth the daughters of his younger
sister Mary by her marriage with Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. As Edward was but nine years
old Henry had appointed a carefully-balanced Council of Regency; but the will fell into Hertford's
keeping, and when the list of regents was at last disclosed Gardiner, who had till now been
the leading minister, was declared to have been excluded from the number of executors. Whether
the exclusion was Henry's act or the act of the men who used his name, the absence of the bishop
with the imprisonment of Norfolk threw the balance of power on the side of the "new men" who
were represented by Hertford and Lisle. Their chief opponent, the Chancellor Wriothesley, struggled
in vain against their next step towards supremacy, the modification of Henry's will by the
nomination of Hertford as Protector of the realm and governor of Edward's person. Alleged directions
from the dying king served as pretexts for the elevation of the whole party to higher rank
in the state. It was to repair "the decay of the old English nobility" that Hertford raised
himself to the dukedom of Somerset and his brother to the barony of Seymour, the queen's brother
Lord Parr to the marquisate of Northampton, Lisle to the earldom of Warwick, Russell to that
of Bedford, Wriothesley to that of Southampton. Ten of their partizans became barons, and as
the number of peers in spite of recent creations still stood at about fifty such a group constituted
a power in the Upper House. Alleged directions of the king were conveniently remembered to
endow the new peers with public money, though the treasury was beggared and the debt pressing.
The expulsion of Wriothesley from the Chancellorship and Council soon left the "new men" without
a check; but they were hardly masters of the royal power when a bold stroke of Somerset laid
all at his feet. A new patent of Protectorate, drawn out in the boy-king's name, empowered
his uncle to act with or without the consent of his fellow-executors, and left him supreme
in the realm.

[Sidenote: Somerset and the Protestants.]

Boldly and adroitly as the whole revolution had been managed, it was none the less a revolution.
To crush their opponents the Council had first used, and then set aside, Henry's will. Hertford
in turn by the use of his nephew's name set aside both the will and the Council. A country
gentleman, who had risen by the accident of his sister's queenship to high rank at the Court,
had thus by sheer intrigue and self-assertion made himself ruler of the realm. But daring and
self-confident as he was, Somerset was forced by his very elevation to seek support for the
power he had won by this surprise in measures which marked the retreat of the Monarchy from
that position of pure absolutism which it had reached at the close of Henry's reign. The Statute
that had given to royal proclamations the force of law was repealed, and several of the new
felonies and treasons which Cromwell had created and used with so terrible an effect were erased
from the Statute Book. The popularity however which such measures won was too vague a force
to serve in the strife of the moment. Against the pressure of the conservative party who had
so suddenly found themselves jockeyed out of power Somerset and the "new men" could look for
no help but from the Protestants. The hope of their support united with the new Protector's
personal predilections in his patronage of the innovations against which Henry had battled
to the last. Cranmer had now drifted into a purely Protestant position; and his open break
with the older system followed quickly on Seymour's rise to power. "This year," says a contemporary,
"the Archbishop of Canterbury did eat meat openly in Lent in the Hall of Lambeth, the like
of which was never seen since England was a Christian country." This notable act was followed
by a rapid succession of sweeping changes. The legal prohibitions of Lollardry were rescinded;
the Six Articles were repealed; a royal injunction removed all pictures and images from the
churches. A formal Statute gave priests the right to marry. A resolution of Convocation which
was confirmed by Parliament brought about the significant change which first definitely marked
the severance of the English Church in doctrine from the Roman, by ordering that the sacrament
of the altar should be administered in both kinds.

[Sidenote: The Common Prayer.]

A yet more significant change followed. The old tongue of the Church was now to be disused
in public worship. The universal use of Latin had marked the Catholic and European character
of the older religion: the use of English marked the strictly national and local character
of the new system. In the spring of 1548 a common Communion Service in English was added to
the solitary Mass of the priest; an English book of Common Prayer, the Liturgy which with slight
alterations is still used in the Church of England, soon replaced the Missal and Breviary from
which its contents are mainly drawn. The name "Common Prayer," which was given to the new Liturgy,
marked its real import. The theory of worship which prevailed through Mediæval Christendom,
the belief that the worshipper assisted only at rites wrought for him by priestly hands, at
a sacrifice wrought through priestly intervention, at the offering of prayer and praise by
priestly lips, was now set at naught. "The laity," it has been picturesquely said, "were called
up into the Chancel." The act of devotion became a "common prayer" of the whole body of worshippers.
The Mass became a "communion" of the whole Christian fellowship. The priest was no longer the
offerer of a mysterious sacrifice, the mediator between God and the worshipper; he was set
on a level with the rest of the Church, and brought down to be the simple mouthpiece of the
congregation.

[Sidenote: The Triumph of the Emperor.]

What gave a wider importance to these measures was their bearing on the general politics of
Christendom. The adhesion of England to the Protestant cause came at a moment when Protestantism
seemed on the verge of ruin. The confidence of the Lutheran princes in their ability to resist
the Emperor had been seen in their refusal of succour from Henry the Eighth. But in the winter
of Henry's death the secession of Duke Maurice of Saxony with many of his colleagues from the
League of Schmalkald so weakened the Protestant body that Charles was able to put its leaders
to the ban of the Empire. Hertford was hardly Protector when the German princes called loudly
for aid; but the fifty thousand crowns which were secretly sent by the English Council could
scarcely have reached them when in April 1547 Charles surprised their camp at Muhlberg and
routed their whole army. The Elector of Saxony was taken prisoner; the Landgrave of Hesse surrendered
in despair. His victory left Charles master of the Empire. The jealousy of the Pope indeed
at once revived with the Emperor's success, and his recall of the bishops from Trent forced
Charles to defer his wider plans for enforcing religious unity; while in Germany itself he
was forced to reckon with Duke Maurice and the Protestant princes who had deserted the League
of Schmalkald, but whose one object in joining the Emperor had been to provide a check on his
after movements. For the moment therefore he was driven to prolong the religious truce by an
arrangement called the "Interim." But the Emperor's purpose was now clear. Wherever his power
was actually felt the religious reaction began; and the Imperial towns which held firmly to
the Lutheran creed were reduced by force of arms. It was of the highest moment that in this
hour of despair the Protestants saw their rule suddenly established in a new quarter, and the
Lutheranism which was being trampled under foot in its own home triumphant in England. England
became the common refuge of the panic-struck Protestants. Bucer and Fagius were sent to lecture
at Cambridge, Peter Martyr advocated the anti-sacramentarian views of Calvin at Oxford. Cranmer
welcomed refugees from every country, Germans, Italians, French, Poles, and Swiss, to his palace
at Lambeth. When persecution broke out in the Low Countries the fugitive Walloons were received
at London and Canterbury, and allowed to set up in both places their own churches.

[Sidenote: Pinkie Cleugh.]

But Somerset dreamed of a wider triumph for "the religion." On his death-bed Henry was said
to have enforced on the Council the need of carrying out his policy of a union of Scotland
with England through the marriage of its Queen with his boy. A wise statesmanship would have
suffered the Protestant movement which had been growing stronger in the northern kingdom since
Beaton's death to run quietly its course; and his colleagues warned Somerset to leave Scotch
affairs untouched till Edward was old enough to undertake them in person. But these counsels
were set aside; and a renewal of the border warfare enforced the Protector's demands for a
closer union of the kingdoms. The jealousy of France was roused at once, and a French fleet
appeared off the Scottish coast to reduce the castle of St. Andrews, which had been held since
Beaton's death by the English partizans who murdered him. The challenge called Somerset himself
to the field; and crossing the Tweed with a fine army of eighteen thousand men in the summer
of 1547 the Protector pushed along the coast till he found the Scots encamped behind the Esk
on the slopes of Musselburgh, six miles eastward of Edinburgh. The English invasion had drawn
all the factions of the kingdom together against the stranger, and a body of "Gospellers" under
Lord Angus formed the advance-guard of the Scotch army as it moved by its right on the tenth
of September to turn the English position and drive Somerset into the sea. The English horse
charged the Scottish front only to be flung off by its pikemen; but their triumph threw the
Lowlanders into disorder, and as they pushed forward in pursuit their advance was roughly checked
by the fire of a body of Italian musketeers whom Somerset had brought with him. The check was
turned into a defeat by a general charge of the English line, a fatal panic broke the Scottish
host, and ten thousand men fell in its headlong flight beneath the English lances.

[Sidenote: Somerset's Policy.]

Victor as he was at Pinkie Cleugh, Somerset was soon forced by famine to fall back from the
wasted country. His victory indeed had been more fatal to the interests of England than a defeat.
The Scots in despair turned as of old to France, and bought its protection by consenting to
the child-queen's marriage with the son of Henry the Second, who had followed Francis on the
throne. In the summer of 1548 Mary Stuart sailed under the escort of a French fleet and landed
safely at Brest. Not only was the Tudor policy of union foiled, as it seemed, for ever, but
Scotland was henceforth to be a part of the French realm. To north as to south England would
feel the pressure of the French king. Nor was Somerset's policy more successful at home. The
religious changes he was forcing on the land were carried through with the despotism, if not
with the vigour, of Cromwell. In his acceptance of the personal supremacy of the sovereign,
Gardiner was ready to bow to every change which Henry had ordered, or which his son, when of
age to be fully king, might order in the days to come. But he denounced all ecclesiastical
changes made during the king's minority as illegal and invalid. Untenable as it was, this protest
probably represented the general mind of Englishmen; but the bishop was committed by the Council
to prison in the Fleet, and though soon released was sent by the Protector to the Tower. The
power of preaching was restricted by the issue of licences only to the friends of the Primate.
While all counter-arguments were rigidly suppressed, a crowd of Protestant pamphleteers flooded
the country with vehement invectives against the Mass and its superstitious accompaniments.
The suppression of chauntries and religious gilds which was now being carried out enabled Somerset
to buy the assent of noble and landowner to his measures by glutting their greed with the last
spoils of the Church.

[Sidenote: The Revolts.]

But it was impossible to buy off the general aversion of the people to the Protector's measures;
and German and Italian mercenaries had to be introduced to stamp out the popular discontent
which broke out in the east, in the west, and in the midland counties. Everywhere men protested
against the new changes and called for the maintenance of the system of Henry the Eighth. The
Cornishmen refused to receive the new service "because it is like a Christmas game." In 1549
Devonshire demanded by open revolt the restoration of the Mass and the Six Articles as well
as a partial re-establishment of the suppressed abbeys. The agrarian discontent woke again
in the general disorder. Enclosures and evictions were going steadily on, and the bitterness
of the change was being heightened by the results of the dissolution of the abbeys. Church
lands had always been underlet, the monks were easy landlords, and on no estates had the peasantry
been as yet so much exempt from the general revolution in culture. But the new lay masters
to whom the abbey lands fell were quick to reap their full value by a rise of rents and by
the same processes of eviction and enclosure as went on elsewhere. The distress was deepened
by the change in the value of money which was now beginning to be felt from the mass of gold
and silver which the New World was yielding to the Old, and still more by a general rise of
prices that followed on the debasement of the coinage which had begun with Henry and went on
yet more unscrupulously under Somerset. The trouble came at last to a head in the manufacturing
districts of the eastern counties. Twenty thousand men gathered round an "oak of Reformation"
near Norwich, and repulsing the royal troops in a desperate engagement renewed the old cries
for a removal of evil counsellors, a prohibition of enclosures, and redress for the grievances
of the poor.

[Sidenote: Somerset's Fall.]

The revolt of the Norfolk men was stamped out in blood by the energy of Lord Warwick, as the
revolt in the west had been put down by Lord Russell, but the risings had given a fatal blow
to Somerset's power. It had already been weakened by strife within his own family. His brother
Thomas had been created Lord Seymour and raised to the post of Lord High Admiral; but, glutted
as he was with lands and honours, his envy at Somerset's fortunes broke out in a secret marriage
with the Queen-dowager, Catharine Parr, in an attempt on her death to marry Elizabeth, and
in intrigues to win the confidence of the young king and detach him from his brother. Abruptly found while

 But the temper of the whole
people rebelled against so lawless a usurpation. The eastern counties rose as one man to support
Mary; and when Northumberland marched from London with ten thousand at his back to crush the
rising, the Londoners, Protestant as they were, showed their ill-will by a stubborn silence.
"The people crowd to look upon us," the Duke noted gloomily, "but not one calls 'God speed
ye.'" While he halted for reinforcements his own colleagues struck him down. Eager to throw
from their necks the yoke of a rival who had made himself a master, the Council no sooner saw
the popular reaction than they proclaimed Mary Queen; and this step was at once followed by
a declaration of the fleet in her favour, and by the announcement of the levies in every shire
that they would only fight in her cause. As the tidings reached him the Duke's courage suddenly
gave way. His retreat to Cambridge was the signal for a general defection. Northumberland himself
threw his cap into the air and shouted with his men for Queen Mary. But his submission failed
to avert his doom; and the death of the Duke drew with it the imprisonment in the Tower of
the hapless girl whom he had made the tool of his ambition.

CHAPTER II

THE CATHOLIC REACTION

1553-1558

[Sidenote: Mary and the Monarchy.]

The triumph of Mary was a fatal blow at the system of despotism which Henry the Eighth had
established. It was a system that rested not so much on the actual strength possessed by the
Crown as on the absence of any effective forces of resistance. At Henry's death the one force
of opposition which had developed itself was that of the Protestants, but whether in numbers
or political weight the Protestants were as yet of small consequence, and their resistance
did little to break the general drift of both nation and king. For great as were the changes
which Henry had wrought in the severance of England from the Papacy and the establishment of
the ecclesiastical supremacy of the Crown, they were wrought with fair assent from the people
at large; and when once the discontent roused by Cromwell's violence had been appeased by his
fall England as a whole acquiesced in the conservative system of the king. This national union
however was broken by the Protectorate. At the moment when it had reached its height the royal
authority was seized by a knot of nobles and recklessly used to further the revolutionary projects
of a small minority of the people. From the hour of this revolution a new impulse was given
to resistance. The older nobility, the bulk of the gentry, the wealthier merchants, the great
mass of the people, found themselves thrown by the very instinct of conservatism into opposition
to the Crown. It was only by foreign hirelings that revolt was suppressed; it was only by a
reckless abuse of the system of packing the Houses that Parliament could be held in check.
At last the Government ventured on an open defiance of law; and a statute of the realm was
set aside at the imperious bidding of a boy of fifteen. Master of the royal forces, wielding
at his will the royal authority, Northumberland used the voice of the dying Edward to set aside
rights of succession as sacred as his own. But the attempt proved an utter failure. The very
forces on which the Duke relied turned against him. The whole nation fronted him in arms. The
sovereign whom the voice of the young king named as his successor passed from the throne to
the Tower, and a sovereign whose title rested on parliamentary statute took her place.

[Sidenote: The religious reaction.]

At the opening of August Mary entered London in triumph. Short and thin in figure, with a face
drawn and colourless that told of constant ill-health, there was little in the outer seeming
of the new queen to recall her father; but her hard, bright eyes, her manlike voice, her fearlessness
and self-will, told of her Tudor blood, as her skill in music, her knowledge of languages,
her love of learning, spoke of the culture and refinement of Henry's Court. Though Mary was
thirty-seven years old, the strict retirement in which she had lived had left her as ignorant
of the actual temper of England as England was ignorant of her own. She had founded her resistance
to the changes of the Protectorate on a resolve to adhere to her father's system till her brother
came of age to rule, and England believed her to be longing like itself simply for a restoration
of what Henry had left. The belief was confirmed by her earlier actions. The changes of the
Protectorate were treated as null and void. Gardiner, Henry's minister, was drawn from the
Tower to take the lead as Chancellor at the Queen's Council-board. Bonner and the deposed bishops
were restored to their sees. Ridley with the others who had displaced them was again expelled.
Latimer, as a representative of the extreme Protestants, was sent to the Tower; and the foreign
refugees, as anti-sacramentarians, were ordered to leave England. On an indignant protest from
Cranmer against reports that he was ready to abandon the new reforms the Archbishop was sent
for his seditious demeanour to the Tower, and soon put on his trial for treason with Lady Jane
Grey, her husband, and two of his brothers. Each pleaded guilty; but no attempt was made to
carry out the sentence of death. In all this England went with the Queen. The popular enthusiasm
hardly waited in fact for the orders of the Government. The whole system which had been pursued
during Edward's reign fell with a sudden crash. London indeed retained much of its Protestant
sympathy, but over the rest of the country the tide of reaction swept without a check. The
married priests were driven from their churches, the images were replaced. In many parishes
the new Prayer Book was set aside and the mass restored. The Parliament which met in October
annulled the laws made respecting religion during the past reign, and re-established the form
of service as used in the last year of Henry the Eighth.

[Sidenote: Mary's aim.]

Up to this point the temper of England went fairly with that of the Queen. But there were from
the first signs of a radical difference between the aim of Mary and that of her people. With
the restoration of her father's system the nation as a whole was satisfied. Mary on the other
hand looked on such a restoration simply as a step towards a complete revival of the system
which Henry had done away. Through long years of suffering and peril her fanaticism had been
patiently brooding over the hope of restoring to England its older religion. She believed,
as she said at a later time to the Parliament, that "she had been predestined and preserved
by God to the succession of the Crown for no other end save that He might make use of her above
all else in the bringing back of the realm to the Catholic faith." Her zeal however was checked
by the fact that she stood almost alone in her aim, as well as by cautious advice from her
cousin, the Emperor; and she assured the Londoners that "albeit her own conscience was stayed
in matters of religion, yet she meant not to compel or strain men's consciences otherwise than
God should, as she trusted, put in their hearts a persuasion of the truth that she was in,
through the opening of his word unto them by godly, and virtuous, and learned preachers." She
had in fact not ventured as yet to refuse the title of "Head of the Church next under God"
or to disclaim the powers which the Act of Supremacy gave her; on the contrary she used these
powers in the regulation of preaching as her father had used them. The strenuous resistance
with which her proposal to set aside the new Prayer Book was met in Parliament warned her of
the difficulties that awaited any projects of radical change. The proposal was carried, but
only after a hot conflict which lasted over six days and which left a third of the Lower House
still opposed to it. Their opposition by no means implied approval of the whole series of religious
changes of which the Prayer Book formed a part, for the more moderate Catholics were pleading
at this time for prayers in the vulgar tongue, and on this question followers of More and Colet
might have voted with the followers of Cranmer. But it showed how far men's minds were from
any spirit of blind reaction or blind compliance with the royal will.

[Sidenote: The Spanish Marriage.]

The temper of the Parliament indeed was very different from that of the Houses which had knelt
before Henry the Eighth. If it consented to repeal the enactment which rendered her mother's
marriage invalid and to declare Mary "born in lawful matrimony," it secured the abolition of
all the new treasons and felonies created in the two last reigns. The demand for their abolition
showed that jealousy of the growth of civil tyranny had now spread from the minds of philosophers
like More to the minds of common Englishmen. Still keener was the jealousy of any marked revolution
in the religious system which Henry had established. The wish to return to the obedience of
Rome lingered indeed among some of the clergy and in the northern shires. But elsewhere the
system of a national Church was popular, and it was backed by the existence of a large and
influential class who had been enriched by the abbey lands. Forty thousand families had profited
by the spoil, and watched anxiously any approach of danger to their new possessions, such as
submission to the Papacy was likely to bring about. On such a submission however Mary was resolved:
and it was to gain strength for such a step that she determined to seek a husband from her
mother's house. The policy of Ferdinand of Aragon, so long held at bay by adverse fortune,
was now to find its complete fulfilment. To one line of the house of Austria, that of Charles
the Fifth, had fallen not only the Imperial Crown but the great heritage of Burgundy, Aragon,
Naples, Castille, and the Castillian dependencies in the New World. To a second, that of the
Emperor's brother Ferdinand, had fallen the Austrian duchies, Bohemia and Hungary. The marriage
of Catharine was now, as it seemed, to bear its fruits by the union of Mary with a son of Charles,
and the placing a third Austrian line upon the throne of England. The gigantic scheme of bringing
all western Europe together under the rule of a single family seemed at last to draw to its
realization.

[Sidenote: Its political grounds.]

It was no doubt from political as well as religious motives that Mary set her heart on this
union. Her rejection of Gardiner's proposal that she should marry the young Courtenay, Earl
of Devon, a son of the Marquis of Exeter whom Henry had beheaded, the resolve which she expressed
to wed "no subject, no Englishman," was founded in part on the danger to her throne from the
pretensions of Mary Stuart, whose adherents cared little for the exclusion of the Scotch line
from the succession by Henry's will and already alleged the illegitimate births of both Mary
Tudor and Elizabeth through the annulling of their mothers' marriages as a ground for denying
their right to the throne. Such claims became doubly formidable through the marriage of Mary
Stuart with the heir of the French Crown, and the virtual union of both Scotland and France
in this claimant's hands. It was only to Charles that the Queen could look for aid against
such a pressure as this, and Charles was forced to give her aid. His old dreams of a mastery
of the world had faded away before the stern realities of the Peace of Passau and his repulse
from the walls of Metz. His hold over the Empire was broken. France was more formidable than
ever. To crown his difficulties the growth of heresy and of the spirit of independence in the
Netherlands threatened to rob him of the finest part of the Burgundian heritage. With Mary
Stuart once on the English throne, and the great island of the west knit to the French monarchy,
the balance of power would be utterly overthrown, the Low Countries lost, and the Imperial
Crown, as it could hardly be doubted, reft from the house of Austria. He was quick therefore
to welcome the Queen's advances, and to offer his son Philip, who though not yet twenty-six
was already a widower, as a candidate for her hand.

[Sidenote: Opposition of Parliament.]

The offer came weighted with a heavy bribe. The keen foresight of the Emperor already saw the
difficulty of holding the Netherlands in union with the Spanish monarchy; and while Spain,
Naples, and Franche Comté descended to Philip's eldest son, Charles promised the heritage of
the Low Countries with England to the issue of Philip and Mary. He accepted too the demand
of Gardiner and the Council that in the event of such a union England should preserve complete
independence both of policy and action. In any case the marriage would save England from the
grasp of France, and restore it, as the Emperor hinted, to the obedience of the Church. But
the project was hardly declared when it was met by an outburst of popular indignation. Gardiner
himself was against a union that would annul the national independence which had till now been
the aim of Tudor policy, and that would drag England helplessly in the wake of the House of
Austria. The mass of conservative Englishmen shrank from the religious aspects of the marriage.
For the Emperor had now ceased to be an object of hope or confidence as a mediator who would
at once purify the Church from abuses, and restore the unity of Christendom; he had ranged
himself definitely on the side of the Papacy and of the Council of Trent; and the cruelties
of the Inquisition which he had introduced into Flanders gave a terrible indication of the
bigotry which he was to bequeath to his House. The marriage with Philip meant, it could hardly
be doubted, a submission to the Papacy, and an undoing not only of the religious changes of
Edward but of the whole system of Henry. Loyal and conservative as was the temper of the Parliament,
it was at one in its opposition to a Spanish marriage and in the request which it made through
a deputation of its members to the Queen that she would marry an Englishman. The request was
a new step forward on the part of the Houses to the recovery of their older rights. Already
called by Cromwell's policy to more than their old power in ecclesiastical matters, their dread
of revolutionary change pushed them to an intervention in matters of state. Mary noted the
advance with all a Tudor's jealousy. She interrupted the speaker; she rebuked the Parliament
for taking too much on itself; she declared she would take counsel on such a matter "with God
and with none other." But the remonstrance had been made, the interference was to serve as
a precedent in the reign to come, and a fresh proof had been given that Parliament was no longer
the slavish tool of the Crown.

[Sidenote: Wyatt's rising.]

But while the nation grumbled and the Parliament remonstrated, one party in the realm was filled
with absolute panic by the news of the Spanish match. The Protestants saw in the marriage not
only the final overthrow of their religious hopes, but a close of the religious truce, and
an opening of persecution. The general opposition to the match, with the dread of the holders
of Church lands that their possessions were in danger, encouraged the more violent to plan
a rising; and France, naturally jealous of an increase of power by its great opponent, promised
to support them by an incursion from Scotland and an attack on Calais. The real aim of the
rebellion was, no doubt, the displacement of Mary, and the setting either of Jane Grey, or,
as the bulk of the Protestants desired, of Elizabeth, on the throne. But these hopes were cautiously
hidden; and the conspirators declared their aim to be that of freeing the Queen from evil counsellors,
and of preventing her union with the Prince of Spain. The plan combined three simultaneous
outbreaks of revolt. Sir Peter Carew engaged to raise the west, the Duke of Suffolk to call
the midland counties to arms, while Sir Thomas Wyatt led the Kentishmen on London. The rising
was planned for the spring of 1554. But the vigilance of the Government drove it to a premature
explosion in January, and baffled it in the centre and the west. Carew fled to France; Suffolk,
who appeared in arms at Leicester, found small response from the people, and was soon sent
prisoner to the Tower. The Kentish rising however proved a more formidable danger. A cry that
the Spaniards were coming "to conquer the realm" drew thousands to Wyatt's standard. The ships
in the Thames submitted to be seized by the insurgents. A party of the train-bands of London,
who marched with the royal guard under the old Duke of Norfolk against them, deserted to the
rebels in a mass with shouts of "A Wyatt! a Wyatt! we are all Englishmen!"

[Sidenote: Its failure.]

Had the Kentishmen moved quickly on the capital, its gates would have been flung open and success
would have been assured. But at the critical moment Mary was saved by her queenly courage.
Riding boldly to the Guildhall she appealed with "a man's voice" to the loyalty of the citizens,
and denounced the declaration of Wyatt's followers as "a Spanish cloak to cover their purpose
against our religion." She pledged herself, "on the word of a Queen, that if it shall not probably
appear to all the nobility and commons in the high court of Parliament that this marriage shall
be for the high benefit and commodity of all the whole realm, then will I abstain from marriage
while I live." The pledge was a momentous one, for it owned the very claim of the two Houses
which the Queen had till now haughtily rejected; and with the remonstrance of the Parliament
still fresh in their ears the Londoners may well have believed that the marriage-project would
come quietly to an end. The dread too of any change in religion by the return of the violent
Protestantism of Edward's day could hardly fail to win Mary support among the citizens. The
mayor answered for their loyalty, and when Wyatt appeared on the Southwark bank the bridge
was secured against him. But the rebel leader knew that the issue of the revolt hung on the
question which side London would take, and that a large part of the Londoners favoured his
cause. Marching therefore up the Thames he seized a bridge at Kingston, threw his force across
the river, and turned rapidly back on the capital. But a night march along miry roads wearied
and disorganized his men; the bulk of them were cut off from their leader by a royal force
which had gathered in the fields at what is now Hyde Park Corner, and only Wyatt himself with
a handful of followers pushed desperately on past the palace of St. James, whence the Queen
refused to fly even while the rebels were marching beneath its walls, along the Strand to Ludgate.
"I have kept touch," he cried as he sank exhausted at the gate. But it was closed: his adherents
within were powerless to effect their promised diversion in his favour; and as he fell back
the daring leader was surrounded at Temple Bar and sent to the Tower.

[Sidenote: The marriage.]

The failure of the revolt was fatal to the girl whom part at least of the rebels would have
placed on the throne. Lady Jane Grey, who had till now been spared and treated with great leniency,
was sent to the block; and her father, her husband, and her uncle, atoned for the ambition
of the House of Suffolk by the death of traitors. Wyatt and his chief adherents followed them
to execution, while the bodies of the poorer insurgents were dangling on gibbets round London.
Elizabeth, who had with some reason been suspected of complicity in the insurrection, was sent
to the Tower; and only saved from death by the interposition of the Council. The leading Protestants
fled in terror over sea. But the failure of the revolt did more than crush the Protestant party;
it enabled the Queen to lay aside the mask of moderation which had been forced on her by the
earlier difficulties of her reign. An order for the expulsion of all married clergy from their
cures, with the deprivation of nine bishops who had been appointed during the Protectorate
and who represented its religious tendencies, proved the Queen's resolve to enter boldly on
a course of reaction. Her victory secured the Spanish marriage. It was to prevent Philip's
union with Mary that Wyatt had risen, and with his overthrow the Queen's policy stood triumphant.
The whole strength of the conservative opposition was lost when opposition could be branded
as disloyalty. Mary too was true to the pledge she had given that the match should only be
brought about with the assent of Parliament. But pressure was unscrupulously used to secure
compliant members in the new elections, and a reluctant assent to the marriage was wrung from
the Houses when they assembled in the spring. Philip was created king of Naples by his father
to give dignity to his union; and in the following July Mary met him at Winchester and became
his wife.

[Sidenote: Philip.]

As he entered London with the Queen, men noted curiously the look of the young king whose fortunes
were to be so closely linked with those of England for fifty years to come. Far younger than
his bride, for he was but twenty-six, there was little of youth in the small and fragile frame,
the sickly face, the sedentary habits, the Spanish silence and reserve, which estranged Englishmen
from Philip as they had already estranged his subjects in Italy and his future subjects in
the Netherlands. Here however he sought by an unusual pleasantness of demeanour as well as
by profuse distributions of gifts to win the national goodwill, for it was only by winning
it that he could accomplish the work he came to do. His first aim was to reconcile England
with the Church. The new Spanish marriage was to repair the harm which the earlier Spanish
marriage had brought about by securing that submission to Rome on which Mary was resolved.
Even before Philip's landing in England the great obstacle to reunion had been removed by the
consent of Julius the Third under pressure from the Emperor to waive the restoration of the
Church lands in the event of England's return to obedience. Other and almost as great obstacles
indeed seemed to remain. The temper of the nation had gone with Henry in his rejection of the
Papal jurisdiction. Mary's counsellors had been foremost among the men who advocated the change.
Her minister, Bishop Gardiner, seemed pledged to oppose any submission to Rome. As secretary
of state after Wolsey's fall he had taken a prominent part in the measures which brought about
a severance between England and the Papacy; as Bishop of Winchester he had written a famous
tract "On True Obedience" in which the Papal supremacy had been expressly repudiated; and to
the end of Henry's days he had been looked upon as the leading advocate of the system of a
national and independent Church. Nor had his attitude changed in Edward's reign. In the process
for his deprivation he avowed himself ready as ever to maintain as well "the supremacy and
supreme authority of the king's majesty that now is as the abolishing of the usurped power
of the Bishop of Rome."

[Sidenote: The submission to Rome.]

But with the later changes of the Protectorate Gardiner had seen his dream of a national yet
orthodox Church vanish away. He had seen how inevitably severance from Rome drew with it a
connexion with the Protestant Churches and a repudiation of Catholic belief. In the hours of
imprisonment his mind fell back on the old ecclesiastical order with which the old spiritual
order seemed inextricably entwined, and he was ready now to submit to the Papacy as the one
means of preserving the faith to which he clung. His attitude was of the highest significance,
for Gardiner more than any one was a representative of the dominant English opinion of his
day. As the moderate party which had supported the policy of Henry the Eighth saw its hopes
disappear, it ranged itself, like the Bishop, on the side of a unity which could now only be
brought about by reconciliation with Rome. The effort of the Protestants in Wyatt's insurrection
to regain their power and revive the system of the Protectorate served only to give a fresh
impulse to this drift of conservative opinion. Mary therefore found little opposition to her
plans. The peers were won over by Philip through the pensions he lavished among them, while
pressure was unscrupulously used by the Council to secure a compliant House of Commons. When
the Parliament met in November these measures were found to have been successful. The attainder
of Reginald Pole, who had been appointed by the Pope to receive the submission of the realm,
was reversed; and the Legate entered London by the river with his cross gleaming from the prow
of his barge. He was solemnly welcomed in full Parliament. The two Houses decided by a formal
vote to return to the obedience of the Papal See; on the assurance of Pole in the Pope's name
that holders of Church lands should not be disturbed in their possession the statutes abolishing
Papal jurisdiction in England were repealed; and Lords and Commons received on their knees
an absolution which freed the realm from the guilt incurred by its schism and heresy.

[Sidenote: Mary's difficulties.]

But, even in the hour of her triumph, the temper both of Parliament and the nation warned the
Queen of the failure of her hope to bind England to a purely Catholic policy. The growing independence
of the two Houses was seen in the impossibility of procuring from them any change in the order
of succession. The victory of Rome was incomplete so long as its right of dispensation was
implicitly denied by a recognition of Elizabeth's legitimacy, and Mary longed to avenge her
mother by humbling the child of Anne Boleyn. But in spite of Pole's efforts and the Queen's
support a proposal to oust her sister from the line of succession could not even be submitted
to the Houses, nor could their assent be won to the postponing the succession of Elizabeth
to that of Philip. The temper of the nation at large was equally decided. In the first Parliament
of Mary a proposal to renew the laws against heresy had been thrown out by the Lords, even
after the failure of Wyatt's insurrection. Philip's influence secured the re-enactment of the
statute of Henry the Fourth in the Parliament which followed his arrival; but the sullen discontent
of London compelled its Bishop, Bonner, to withdraw a series of articles of enquiry, by which
he hoped to purge his diocese of heresy, and even the Council was divided on the question of
persecution. In the very interests of Catholicism the Emperor himself counselled prudence and
delay. Philip gave the same counsel. From the moment of his arrival the young king exercised
a powerful influence over the Government, and he was gradually drawing into his hands the whole
direction of affairs. But, bigot as he was in matters of faith, Philip's temper was that of
a statesman, not of a fanatic. If he came to England resolute to win the country to union with
the Church, his conciliatory policy was already seen in the concessions he wrested from the
Papacy in the matter of the Church lands, and his aim was rather to hold England together and
to give time for a reaction of opinion than to revive the old discord by any measures of severity.
It was indeed only from a united and contented England that he could hope for effective aid
in the struggle of his house with France, and in spite of his pledges Philip's one aim in marrying
Mary was to secure that aid.

[Sidenote: The persecution.]

But whether from without or from within warning was wasted on the fierce bigotry of the Queen.
It was, as Gardiner asserted, not at the counsel of her ministers but by her own personal will
that the laws against heresy had been laid before Parliament; and now that they were enacted
Mary pressed for their execution. Her resolve was probably quickened by the action of the Protestant
zealots. The failure of Wyatt's revolt was far from taming the enthusiasm of the wilder reformers.
The restoration of the old worship was followed by outbreaks of bold defiance. A tailor of
St. Giles in the Fields shaved a dog with the priestly tonsure. A cat was found hanging in
the Cheap "with her head shorn, and the likeness of a vestment cast over her, with her forefeet
tied together and a round piece of paper like a singing cake between them." Yet more galling
were the ballads which were circulated in mockery of the mass, the pamphlets which came from
the exiles over sea, the seditious broadsides dropped in the streets, the interludes in which
the most sacred acts of the old religion were flouted with ribald mockery. All this defiance
only served to quicken afresh the purpose of the Queen. But it was not till the opening of
1555, when she had already been a year and a half on the throne, that the opposition of her
councillors was at last mastered and the persecution began. In February the deprived bishop
of Gloucester, Hooper, was burned in his cathedral city, a London vicar, Lawrence Saunders,
at Coventry, and Rogers, a prebendary of St. Paul's, at London. Ferrar, the deprived bishop
of St. David's, who was burned at Caermarthen, was one of eight victims who suffered in March.
Four followed in April and May, six in June, eleven in July, eighteen in August, eleven in
September. In October Ridley, the deprived bishop of London, was drawn with Latimer from their
prison at Oxford.

[Sidenote: Rowland Taylor.]

If the Protestants had not known how to govern, indeed, they knew how to die; and the cause
which prosperity had ruined revived in the dark hour of persecution. The memory of their violence
and greed faded away as they passed unwavering to their doom. Such a story as that of Rowland
Taylor, the Vicar of Hadleigh, tells us more of the work which was now begun, and of the effect
it was likely to produce, than pages of historic dissertation. Taylor, who as a man of mark
had been one of the first victims chosen for execution, was arrested in London, and condemned
to suffer in his own parish. His wife, "suspecting that her husband should that night be carried
away," had waited through the darkness with her children in the porch of St. Botolph's beside
Aldgate. "Now when the sheriff his company came against St. Botolph's Church Elizabeth cried,
saying, 'O my dear father! Mother! mother! here is my father led away!' Then cried his wife,
'Rowland, Rowland, where art thou?'--for it was a very dark morning, that the one could not
see the other. Dr. Taylor answered, 'I am here, dear wife,' and stayed. The sheriff's men would
have led him forth, but the sheriff said, 'Stay a little, masters, I pray you, and let him
speak to his wife.' Then came she to him, and he took his daughter Mary in his arms, and he
and his wife and Elizabeth knelt down and said the Lord's prayer. At which sight the sheriff
wept apace, and so did divers others of the company. After they had prayed he rose up and kissed
his wife and shook her by the hand, and said, 'Farewell, my dear wife, be of good comfort,
for I am quiet in my conscience! God shall still be a father to my children.'... Then said
his wife, 'God be with thee, dear Rowland! I will, with God's grace, meet thee at Hadleigh.'

"All the way Dr. Taylor was merry and cheerful as one that accounted himself going to a most
pleasant banquet or bridal.... Coming within two miles of Hadleigh he desired to light off
his horse, which done he leaped and set a frisk or twain as men commonly do for dancing. 'Why,
master Doctor,' quoth the Sheriff, 'how do you now?' He answered, 'Well, God be praised, Master
Sheriff, never better; for now I know I am almost at home. I lack not past two stiles to go
over, and I am even at my Father's house!'... The streets of Hadleigh were beset on both sides
with men and women of the town and country who waited to see him; whom when they beheld so
led to death, with weeping eyes and lamentable voices, they cried, 'Ah, good Lord! there goeth
our good shepherd from us!'" The journey was at last over. One of the executioners "cruelly
cast a fagot at him, which hit upon his head and brake his face that the blood ran down his
visage. Then said Dr. Taylor, 'O friend, I have harm enough--what needed that?'" One more act
of brutality brought his sufferings to an end.

[Sidenote: The area of the Martyrdoms.]

The terror of death was powerless against men like these. Bonner, the Bishop of London, to
whom, as bishop of the diocese in which the Council sate, its victims were generally delivered
for execution, but who, in spite of the nickname and hatred which his official prominence in
the work of death earned him, seems to have been naturally a good-humoured and merciful man,
asked a youth who was brought before him whether he thought he could bear the fire. The boy
at once held his hand without flinching in the flame of a candle that stood by. Rogers, a fellow-worker
with Tyndale in the translation of the Bible, and one of the foremost among the Protestant
preachers, died bathing his hands in the flame "as if it had been in cold water." Even the
commonest lives gleamed for a moment into poetry at the stake. "Pray for me," a boy, William
Brown, who had been brought home to Brentwood to suffer, asked of the bystanders. "I will pray
no more for thee," one of them replied, "than I will pray for a dog." "'Then,' said William,
'Son of God, shine upon me'; and immediately the sun in the elements shone out of a dark cloud
so full in his face that he was constrained to look another way; whereat the people mused because
it was so dark a little time before." Brentwood lay within a district on which the hand of
the Queen fell heavier than elsewhere. The persecution was mainly confined to the more active
and populous parts of the country, to London, Kent, Sussex, and the Eastern Counties. Of the
two hundred and eighty whom we know to have suffered during the last three years and a half
of Mary's reign more than forty were burned in London, seventeen in the neighbouring village
of Stratford-le-Bow, four in Islington, two in Southwark, and one each at Barnet, St. Albans,
and Ware. Kent, at that time a home of mining and manufacturing industry, suffered as heavily
as London. Of its sixty martyrs more than forty were furnished by Canterbury, which was then
but a city of some few thousand inhabitants, and seven by Maidstone. The remaining eight suffered
at Rochester, Ashford, and Dartford. Of the twenty-five who died in Sussex the little town
of Lewes sent seventeen to the fire. Seventy were contributed by the Eastern Counties, the
seat of the woollen manufacture. Beyond these districts executions were rare. Westward of Sussex
we find the record of but a dozen martyrdoms, six of which were at Bristol, and four at Salisbury.
Chester and Wales contributed but four sufferers to the list. In the Midland Counties between
Thames and the Humber only twenty-four suffered martyrdom. North of the Humber we find the
names of but two Yorkshiremen burned at Bedale.

[Sidenote: Failure of the persecution.]

But heavily as the martyrdoms fell on the district within which they were practically confined,
and where as we may conclude Protestantism was more dominant than elsewhere, the work of terror
failed in the very ends for which it was wrought. The old spirit of insolent defiance, of outrageous
violence, rose into fresh life at the challenge of persecution. A Protestant hung a string
of puddings round a priest's neck in derision of his beads. The restored images were grossly
insulted. The old scurrilous ballads against the mass and relics were heard in the streets.
Men were goaded to sheer madness by the bloodshed and violence about them. One miserable wretch,
driven to frenzy, stabbed the priest of St. Margaret's as he stood with the chalice in his
hand. It was a more formidable sign of the times that acts of violence such as these no longer
stirred the people at large to their former resentment. The horror of the persecution swept
away all other feelings. Every death at the stake won hundreds to the cause for which the victims
died. "You have lost the hearts of twenty thousands that were rank Papists within these twelve
months," a Protestant wrote triumphantly to Bonner. Bonner indeed, who had never been a very
zealous persecutor, was sick of his work; and the energy of the bishops soon relaxed. But Mary
had no thought of hesitation in the course she had entered on, and though the Imperial ambassador
noted the rapid growth of public discontent "rattling letters" from the council pressed the
lagging prelates to fresh activity. Yet the persecution had hardly begun before difficulties
were thickening round the Queen. In her passionate longing for an heir who would carry on her
religious work Mary had believed herself to be with child; but in the summer of 1555 all hopes
of any childbirth passed away, and the overthrow of his projects for the permanent acquisition
of England to the House of Austria at once disenchanted Philip with his stay in the realm.
But even had all gone well it was impossible for the king to remain longer in England. He was
needed in the Netherlands to play his part in the memorable act which was to close the Emperor's
political life. Already King of Naples and Lord of Milan, Philip received by his father's solemn
resignation on the twenty-fifth of October the Burgundian heritage; and a month later Charles
ceded to him the crowns of Castille and Aragon with their dependencies in the New World and
in the Old. The Empire indeed passed to his uncle Ferdinand of Austria; but with this exception
the whole of his father's vast dominions lay now in the grasp of Philip. Of the realms which
he ruled, England was but one and far from the greatest one, and even had he wished to return
his continued stay there became impossible.

[Sidenote: The Catholic revival.]

He was forced to leave the direction of affairs to Cardinal Pole, who on the death of Gardiner
in November 1555 took the chief place in Council. At once Papal Legate and chief minister of
the Crown, Pole carried on that union of the civil and ecclesiastical authority which had been
first seen in Wolsey and had formed the groundwork of the system of Cromwell. But he found
himself hampered by difficulties which even the ability of Cromwell or Wolsey could hardly
have met. The embassy which carried to Rome the submission of the realm found a fresh Pope,
Paul the Fourth, on the throne. His accession marked the opening of a new era in the history
of the Papacy. Till now the fortunes of Catholicism had been steadily sinking to a lower ebb.
With the Peace of Passau the Empire seemed lost to it. The new Protestant faith stood triumphant
in the north of Germany, and it was already advancing to the conquest of the south. The nobles
of Austria were forsaking the older religion. A Venetian ambassador estimated the German Catholics
at little more than a tenth of the whole population of Germany. Eastward the nobles of Hungary
and Poland became Protestants in a mass. In the west France was yielding more and more to heresy,
and England had hardly been rescued from it by Mary's accession. Only where the dead hand of
Spain lay heavy, in Castille, in Aragon, or in Italy, was the Reformation thoroughly crushed
out; and even the dead hand of Spain failed to crush heresy in the Low Countries. But at the
moment when ruin seemed certain the older faith rallied to a new resistance. While Protestantism
was degraded and weakened by the prostitution of the Reformation to political ends, by the
greed and worthlessness of the German princes who espoused its cause, by the factious lawlessness
of the nobles in Poland and the Huguenots in France, while it wasted its strength in theological
controversies and persecutions, in the bitter and venomous discussions between the Churches
which followed Luther and the Churches which followed Zwingli or Calvin, the great communion
which it assailed felt at last the uses of adversity. The Catholic world rallied round the
Council of Trent. In the very face of heresy the Catholic faith was anew settled and defined.
The Papacy was owned afresh as the centre of Catholic union. The enthusiasm of the Protestants
was met by a counter-enthusiasm among their opponents. New religious orders rose to meet the
wants of the day; the Capuchins became the preachers of Catholicism, the Jesuits became not
only its preachers but its directors, its schoolmasters, its missionaries, its diplomatists.
Their organization, their blind obedience, their real ability, their fanatical zeal, galvanized
the pulpit, the school, the confessional, into a new life.

[Sidenote: Paul the Fourth.]

It was this movement, this rally of Catholicism, which now placed its representative on the
Papal throne. At the moment when Luther was first opening his attack on the Papacy Giovanni
Caraffa had laid down his sees of Chieti and Brindisi to found the order of Theatines in a
little house on the Pincian Hill. His aim was the reformation of the clergy, but the impulse
which he gave told on the growing fervour of the Catholic world, and its issue was seen in
the institution of the Capuchins and the Jesuits. Created Cardinal by Paul the Third, he found
himself face to face with the more liberal theologians who were longing for a reconciliation
between Lutheranism and the Papacy, such as Contarini and Pole, but his violent orthodoxy foiled
their efforts in the conference at Ratisbon, and prevailed on the Pope to trust to the sterner
methods of the Inquisition. As Caraffa wielded its powers, the Inquisition spread terror throughout
Italy. At due intervals groups of heretics were burned before the Dominican Church at Rome;
scholars like Peter Martyr were driven over sea; and the publication of an index of prohibited
books gave a death-blow to Italian literature. On the verge of eighty the stern Inquisitor
became Pope as Paul the Fourth. His conception of the Papal power was as high as that of Hildebrand
or Innocent the Third, and he flung contemptuously aside the system of compromise which his
predecessor had been brought to adopt by the caution of the Emperor. "Charles," he said, was
a "favourer of heretics," and he laid to his charge the prosperity of Lutheranism in the Empire.
That England should make terms for its return to obedience galled his pride, while his fanaticism
would hear of no surrender of the property of the Church. Philip, who had wrested the concession
from Julius the Third, had no influence over a Pope who hoped to drive the Spaniards from Italy,
and Pole was suspected by Paul of a leaning to heresy.

[Sidenote: England and the Papacy.]

The English ambassadors found therefore a rough greeting when the terms of the submission were
laid before the Pope. Paul utterly repudiated the agreement which had been entered into between
the Legate and the Parliament; he demanded the restoration of every acre of Church property;
and he annulled all alienation of it by a general bull. His attitude undid all that Mary had
done. In spite of the pompous reconciliation in which the Houses had knelt at the feet of Pole,
England was still unreconciled to the Papacy, for the country and the Pope were at issue on
a matter where concession was now impossible on either side. The Queen's own heart went with
the Pope's demand. But the first step on which she ventured towards a compliance with it showed
the difficulties she would have to meet. The grant of the first-fruits to Henry the Eighth
had undoubtedly rested on his claim of supremacy over the Church; and now that this was at
an end Mary had grounds for proposing their restoration to church purposes. But the proposal
was looked on as a step towards the resumption of the monastic lands, and after a hot and prolonged
debate at the close of 1555 the Commons only assented to it by a small majority. It was plain
that no hearing would be given to the Pope's demand for a restoration of all Church property;
great lords were heard to threaten that they would keep their lands so long as they had a sword
by their side; and England was thus left at hopeless variance with the Papacy.

[Sidenote: Cranmer.]

But, difficult as Mary's task became, she clung as tenaciously as ever to her work of blood.
The martyrdoms went steadily on, and at the opening of 1556 the sanction of Rome enabled the
Queen to deal with a victim whose death woke all England to the reality of the persecution.
Far as he stood in character beneath many who had gone before him to the stake, Cranmer stood
high above all in his ecclesiastical position. To burn the Primate of the English Church for
heresy was to shut out meaner victims from all hope of escape. And on the position of Cranmer
none cast a doubt. The other prelates who had suffered had been placed in their sees after
the separation from Rome, and were hardly regarded as bishops by their opponents. But, whatever
had been his part in the schism, Cranmer had received his Pallium from the Pope. He was, in
the eyes of all, Archbishop of Canterbury, the successor of St. Augustine and of St. Thomas
in the second see of Western Christendom. Revenge however and religious zeal alike urged the
Queen to bring Cranmer to the stake. First among the many decisions in which the Archbishop
had prostituted justice to Henry's will stood that by which he had annulled the king's marriage
with Catharine and declared Mary a bastard. The last of his political acts had been to join,
whether reluctantly or no, in the shameless plot to exclude Mary from the throne. His great
position too made Cranmer more than any man a representative of the religious revolution which
had passed over the land. His figure stood with those of Henry and of Cromwell on the frontispiece
of the English Bible. The decisive change which had been given to the character of the Reformation
under Edward was due wholly to Cranmer. It was his voice that men heard and still hear in the
accents of the English Liturgy.

[Sidenote: His death.]

As an Archbishop, Cranmer's judgment rested with no meaner tribunal than that of Rome, and
his execution had been necessarily delayed till its sentence could be given. It was not till
the opening of 1556 that the Papal see convicted him of heresy. As a heretic he was now condemned
to suffer at the stake.

[Sidenote: War with France.]

It was with the unerring instinct of a popular movement that, among a crowd of far more heroic
sufferers, the Protestants fixed, in spite of his recantations, on the martyrdom of Cranmer
as the death-blow to Catholicism in England. For one man who felt within him the joy of Rowland
Taylor at the prospect of the stake, there were thousands who felt the shuddering dread of
Cranmer. The triumphant cry of Latimer could reach only hearts as bold as his own, while the
sad pathos of the Primate's humiliation and repentance struck chords of sympathy and pity in
the hearts of all. It is from that moment that we may trace the bitter remembrance of the blood
shed in the cause of Rome; which, however partial and unjust it must seem to an historic observer,
still lies graven deep in the temper of the English people. But the Queen struggled desperately
on. She did what was possible to satisfy the unyielding Pope. In the face of the Parliament's
significant reluctance even to restore the first-fruits to the Church, she refounded all she
could of the abbeys which had been suppressed. One of the greatest of these, the Abbey of Westminster,
was re-established before the close of 1556, and John Feckenham installed as its abbot. Such
a step could hardly fail to wake the old jealousy of any attempt to reclaim the Church lands,
and thus to alienate the nobles and gentry from the Queen. They were soon to be alienated yet
more by her breach of the solemn covenant on which her marriage was based. Even the most reckless
of her counsellors felt the unwisdom of aiding Philip in his strife with France. The accession
of England to the vast dominion which the Emperor had ceded to his son in 1555 all but realized
the plans of Ferdinand the Catholic for making the house of Austria master of Western Christendom.
France was its one effective foe; and the overthrow of France in the war which was going on
between the two powers would leave Philip without a check. How keenly this was felt at the
English council-board was seen in the resistance which was made to Philip's effort to drag
his new realm into the war. Such an effort was in itself a crowning breach of faith, for the
king's marriage had been accompanied by a solemn pledge that England should not be drawn into
the strifes of Spain. But Philip knew little of good faith when his interest was at stake.
The English fleet would give him the mastery of the seas, English soldiers would turn the scale
in Flanders, and at the opening of 1557 the king again crossed the Channel and spent three
months in pressing his cause on Mary and her advisers.

[Sidenote: Loss of Calais.]

"He did more," says a Spanish writer of the time, "than any one would have believed possible
with that proud and indomitable nation." What he was most aided by was provocation from France.
A body of refugees who had found shelter there landed in Yorkshire in the spring; and their
leader, Thomas Stafford, a grandson of the late Duke of Buckingham, called the people to rise
against the tyranny of foreigners and "the satanic designs of an unlawful Queen." The French
king hoped that a rising would give the Queen work at home; but the revolt was easily crushed,
and the insult enabled Mary to override her counsellors' reluctance and to declare war against
France. The war opened with triumphs both on land and at sea. The junction of the English fleet
made Philip master of the Channel. Eight thousand men, "all clad in their green," were sent
to Flanders under Lord Pembroke, and joined Philip's forces in August in time to take part
in the great victory of St. Quentin. In October the little army returned home in triumph, but
the gleam of success vanished suddenly away. In the autumn of 1557 the English ships were defeated
in an attack on the Orkneys. In January 1558 the Duke of Guise flung himself with characteristic
secrecy and energy upon Calais and compelled it to surrender before succour could arrive. "The
chief jewel of the realm," as Mary herself called it, was suddenly reft away; and the surrender
of Guisnes, which soon followed, left England without a foot of land on the Continent.

[Sidenote: Mary and Ireland.]

Bitterly as the blow was felt, the Council, though passionately pressed by the Queen, could
find neither money nor men for any attempt to recover the town. The war indeed went steadily
for Spain and her allies; and Philip owed his victory at Gravelines in the summer of 1558 mainly
to the opportune arrival of ten English ships of war which opened fire on the flank of the
French army that lay open to the sea. But England could not be brought to take further part
in the contest. The levies which were being raised mutinied and dispersed. The forced loan
to which Mary was driven to resort came in slowly. The treasury was drained not only by the
opening of the war with France but by the opening of a fresh strife in Ireland. To the struggle
of religion which had begun there under the Protectorate the accession of Mary had put an end.
The shadowy form of the earlier Irish Protestantism melted quietly away. There were in fact
no Protestants in Ireland save the new bishops; and when Bale had fled over sea from his diocese
of Ossory and his fellow-prelates had been deprived the Irish Church resumed its old appearance.
No attempt indeed was made to restore the monasteries; and Mary exercised her supremacy, deposed
or appointed bishops, and repudiated Papal interference with her ecclesiastical acts as vigorously
as her father. But the Mass was restored, the old modes of religious worship were again held
in honour, and religious dissension between the Government and its Irish subjects came for
the time to an end. With the close however of one danger came the rise of another. England
was growing tired of the policy of conciliation which had been steadily pursued by Henry the
Eighth and his successor. As yet it had been rewarded with precisely the sort of success which
Wolsey and Cromwell anticipated. The chiefs had come quietly in to the plan, and their septs
had followed them in submission to the new order. "The winning of the Earl of Desmond was the
winning of the rest of Munster with small charges. The making O'Brien an Earl made all that
country obedient." The Macwilliam became Lord Clanrickard, and the Fitzpatricks Barons of Upper
Ossory. A visit of the great northern chief who had accepted the title of Earl of Tyrone to
the English Court was regarded as a marked step in the process of civilization.

[Sidenote: The Irish War.]

In the south, where the system of English law was slowly spreading, the chieftains sate on
the bench side by side with the English justices of the peace; and something had been done
to check the feuds and disorder of the wild tribes between Limerick and Tipperary. "Men may
pass quietly throughout these countries without danger of robbery or other displeasure." In
the Clanrickard county, once wasted with war, "ploughing increaseth daily." In Tyrone and the
north however the old disorder reigned without a check; and everywhere the process of improvement
tried the temper of the English Deputies by the slowness of its advance. The only hope of any
real progress lay in patience; and there were signs that the Government at Dublin found it
hard to wait. The "rough handling" of the chiefs by Sir Edward Bellingham, a Lord Deputy under
the Protector Somerset, roused a spirit of revolt that only subsided when the poverty of the
Exchequer forced him to withdraw the garrisons he had planted in the heart of the country.
His successor in Mary's reign, Lord Sussex, made raid after raid to no purpose on the obstinate
tribes of the north, burning in one the Cathedral of Armagh and three other churches. A far
more serious breach in the system of conciliation was made when the project of English colonization
which Henry had steadily rejected was adopted by the same Lord Deputy, and when the country
of the O'Connors was assigned to English settlers and made shire-land under the names of King's
and Queen's Counties in honour of Philip and Mary. A savage warfare began at once between the
planters and the dispossessed septs, a warfare which only ended in the following reign in the
extermination of the Irishmen, and commissioners were appointed to survey waste lands with
the aim of carrying the work of colonization into other districts. The pressure of the war
against France put an end to these wider projects, but the strife in Meath went savagely on
and proved a sore drain to the Exchequer.

[Sidenote: Scotland and Protestantism.]

Nor was Mary without difficulties in the North. Religiously as well as politically her reign
told in a marked way on the fortunes of Scotland. If the Queen's policy failed to crush Protestantism
in England, it gave a new impulse to it in the northern realm. In Scotland the wealth and worldliness
of the great churchmen had long ago spread a taste for heresy among the people; and Lollardry
survived as a power north of the border long after it had almost died out to the south of it.
The impulse of the Lutheran movement was seen in the diffusion of the new opinions by a few
scholars, such as Wishart and Hamilton; but though Henry the Eighth pressed his nephew James
the Fifth to follow him in the work he was doing in England, it was plain that the Scotch reformers
could look for little favour from the Crown. The policy of the Scottish kings regarded the
Church as their ally against the turbulent nobles, and James steadily held its enemies at bay.
The Regent, Mary of Guise, clung to the same policy. But stoutly as the whole nation withstood
the English efforts to acquire a political supremacy, the religious revolution in England told
more and more on the Scotch nobles. No nobility was so poor as that of Scotland, and nowhere
in Europe was the contrast between their poverty and the riches of the Church so great. Each
step of the vast spoliation that went on south of the border, the confiscation of the lesser
abbeys, the suppression of the greater, the secularization of chauntries and hospitals, woke
a fresh greed in the baronage of the north. The new opinions soon found disciples among them.
It was a group of Protestant nobles who surprised the Castle of St. Andrews and murdered Cardinal
Beaton. The "Gospellers" from the Lowlands already formed a marked body in the army that fought
at Pinkie Cleugh. As yet however the growth of the new opinions had been slow, and there had
been till now little public show of resistance to the religion of the State.

[Sidenote: Knox.]

With the accession of Mary however all was changed. Under Henry and Edward the Catholicism
of Scotland had profited by the national opposition to a Protestant England; but now that Catholicism
was again triumphant in England Protestantism became far less odious to the Scotch statesmen.
A still greater change was wrought by the marriage with Philip. Such a match, securing as it
did to England the aid of Spain in any future aggression upon Scotland, became a danger to
the northern realm which not only drew her closer to France but forced her to give shelter
and support to the sectaries who promised to prove a check upon Mary. Many of the exiles therefore
who left England for the sake of religion found a refuge in Scotland. Amongst these was John
Knox. Knox had been one of the followers of Wishart; he had acted as pastor to the Protestants
who after Beaton's murder held the Castle of St. Andrews, and had been captured with them by
a French force in the summer of 1547. The Frenchmen sent the heretics to the galleys; and it
was as a galley slave in one of their vessels that Knox next saw his native shores. As the
vessel lay tossing in the bay of St. Andrews, a comrade bade him look to the land, and asked
him if he knew it. "I know it well" was the answer; "for I see the steeple of that place where
God first in public opened my mouth to His glory; and I am fully persuaded, how weak that ever
I now appear, I shall not depart this life till my tongue glorify His holy name in the same
place!" It was long however before he could return. Released at the opening of 1549, Knox found
shelter in England, where he became one of the most stirring among the preachers of the day,
and was offered a bishoprick by Northumberland. Mary's accession drove him again to France.
But the new policy of the Regent now opened Scotland to the English refugees, and it was as
one of these that Knox returned in 1555 to his own country. Although he soon withdrew to take
charge of the English congregation at Frankfort and Geneva his energy had already given a decisive
impulse to the new movement. In a gathering at the house of Lord Erskine he persuaded the assembly
to "refuse all society with idolatry, and bind themselves to the uttermost of their power to
maintain the true preaching of the Evangile, as God should offer to their preachers an opportunity."
The confederacy woke anew the jealousy of the government, and persecution revived. But some
of the greatest nobles now joined the reforming cause. The Earl of Morton, the head of the
house of Douglas, the Earl of Argyle, the greatest chieftain of the west, and above all a bastard
son of the late king, Lord James Stuart, who bore as yet the title of prior of St. Andrews,
but who was to be better known afterwards as the Earl of Murray, placed themselves at the head
of the movement. The remonstrances of Knox from his exile at Geneva stirred them to interfere
in behalf of the persecuted Protestants; and at the close of 1557 these nobles united with
the rest of the Protestant leaders in an engagement which became memorable as the first among
those Covenants which were to give shape and colour to Scotch religion.

[Sidenote: Scotland and Protestantism.]

The Covenant of the Scotch nobles marked a new epoch in the strife of religions. Till now the
reformers had opposed the doctrine of nationality to the doctrine of Catholicism. In the teeth
of the pretensions which the Church advanced to a uniformity of religion in every land, whatever
might be its differences of race or government, the first Protestants had advanced the principle
that each prince or people had alone the right to determine its form of faith and worship.
"Cujus regio" ran the famous phrase which embodied their theory, "ejus religio." It was the
acknowledgement of this principle that the Lutheran princes obtained at the Diet of Spires;
it was on this principle that Henry based his Act of Supremacy. Its strength lay in the correspondence
of such a doctrine with the political circumstances of the time. It was the growing feeling
of nationality which combined with the growing developement of monarchical power to establish
the theory that the political and religious life of each nation should be one, and that the
religion of the people should follow the faith of the prince. Had Protestantism, as seemed
at one time possible, secured the adhesion of all the European princes, such a theory might
well have led everywhere as it led in England to the establishment of the worst of tyrannies,
a tyranny that claims to lord alike over both body and soul. The world was saved from this
danger by the tenacity with which the old religion still held its power. In half the countries
of Europe the disciples of the new opinions had soon to choose between submission to their
conscience and submission to their prince; and a movement which began in contending for the
religious supremacy of kings ended in those wars of religion which arrayed nation after nation
against their sovereigns. In this religious revolution Scotland led the way. Her Protestantism
was the first to draw the sword against earthly rulers. The solemn "Covenant" which bound together
her "Congregation" in the face of the regency, which pledged its members to withdraw from all
submission to the religion of the State and to maintain in the face of the State their liberty
of conscience, opened that vast series of struggles which ended in Germany with the Peace of
Westphalia and in England with the Toleration Act of William the Third.

[Sidenote: The Exiles.]

The "Covenant" of the lords sounded a bold defiance to the Catholic reaction across the border.
While Mary replaced the Prayer-Book by the Mass, the Scotch lords resolved that wherever their
power extended the Common Prayer should be read in all churches. While hundreds were going
to the stake in England the Scotch nobles boldly met the burning of their preachers by a threat
of war. "They trouble our preachers," ran their bold remonstrance against the bishops in the
Queen-mother's presence; "they would murder them and us! shall we suffer this any longer? No,
madam, it shall not be!" and therewith every man put on his steel bonnet. The Regent was helpless
for the moment and could find refuge only in fair words, words so fair that for a while the
sternest of the reformers believed her to be drifting to their faith. She was in truth fettered
by the need of avoiding civil strife at a time when the war of England against France made
a Scotch war against England inevitable. The nobles refused indeed to cross the border, but
the threat of a Scotch invasion was one of the dangers against which Mary Tudor now found herself
forced to provide. Nor was the uprise of Protestantism in Scotland the only result of her policy
in giving fire and strength to the new religion. Each step in the persecution had been marked
by a fresh flight of preachers, merchants, and gentry across the seas. "Some fled into France,
some into Flanders, and some into the high countries of the Empire." As early as 1554 we find
groups of such refugees at Frankfort, Emden, Zürich, and Strassburg. Calvin welcomed some of
them at Geneva; the "lords of Berne" suffered a group to settle at Aarau; a hundred gathered
round the Duchess of Suffolk at Wesel. Amongst the exiles we find many who were to be bishops
and statesmen in the coming reign. Sir Francis Knollys was at Frankfort, Sir Francis Walsingham
travelled in France; among the divines were the later archbishops Grindal and Sandys, and the
later bishops Horne, Parkhurst, Aylmer, Jewel, and Cox. Mingled with these were men who had
already played their part in Edward's reign, such as Poinet, the deprived Bishop of Winchester,
Bale, the deprived Bishop of Ossory, and the preachers Lever and Knox.

[Sidenote: The Extreme Protestants.]

Gardiner had threatened that the fugitives should gnaw their fingers from hunger, but ample
supplies reached them from London merchants and other partizans in England, and they seem to
have lived in fair comfort while their brethren at home were "going to the fire." Their chief
troubles sprang from strife among themselves. The hotter spirits among the English Protestants
had seen with discontent the retention of much that they looked on as superstitious and Popish
in even the last liturgy of Edward's reign. That ministers should still wear white surplices,
that litanies should be sung, that the congregation should respond to the priest, that babes
should be signed in baptism with the sign of the cross, that rings should be given in marriage,
filled them with horror. Hooper, the leader of this party, refused when made bishop to don
his rochet; and had only been driven by imprisonment to vest himself in "the rags of Popery."
Trivial indeed as such questions seemed in themselves, an issue lay behind them which was enough
to make men face worse evils than a prison. The royal supremacy, the headship of the Church,
which Henry the Eighth claimed for himself and his successors, was, as we have seen, simply
an application of the principle which the states of North Germany had found so effective in
meeting the pretensions of the Emperor or the Pope. The same sentiment of national life took
a new form in the preservation of whatever the change of religious thought left it possible
to preserve in the national tradition of faith and worship. In the Lutheran churches, though
the Mass was gone, reredos and crucifix remained untouched. In England the whole ecclesiastical
machinery was jealously preserved. Its Church was still governed by bishops who traced their
succession to the Apostles. The words of its new Prayer-Book adhered as closely as they might
to the words of Missal and Breviary. What made such an arrangement possible was the weakness
of the purely religious impulse in the earlier stages of the Reformation. In Germany indeed
or in England, the pressure for theological change was small; the religious impulse told on
but a small part, and that not an influential part, of the population; it did in fact little
more than quicken and bring into action the older and widely-felt passion for ecclesiastical
independence.

[Sidenote: Protestantism and the Supremacy.]

But the establishment of this independence at once gave fresh force to the religious movement.
From denouncing the Pope as a usurper of national rights men passed easily to denounce the
Papal system as in itself Antichristian. In setting aside the voice of the Papacy as a ground
of faith the new churches had been forced to find a ground of faith in the Bible. But the reading
and discussion of the Bible opened up a thousand questions of belief and ritual, and the hatred
of Rome drew men more and more to find answers to such questions which were antagonistic to
the creed and usages of a past that was identified in their eyes with the Papacy. Such questions
could hardly fail to find an echo in the people at large. To the bulk of men ecclesiastical
institutions are things dim and remote; and the establishment of ecclesiastical independence,
though it gratified the national pride, could have raised little personal enthusiasm. But the
direct and personal interest of every man seemed to lie in the right holding of religious truth,
and thus the theological aspect of the Reformation tended more and more to supersede its political
one. All that is generous and chivalrous in human feeling told in the same direction. To statesmen
like Gardiner or Paget the acceptance of one form of faith or worship after another as one
sovereign after another occupied the throne seemed, no doubt, a logical and inevitable result
of their acceptance of the royal supremacy. But to the people at large there must have been
something false and ignoble in the sight of a statesman or a priest who had cast off the Mass
under Edward to embrace it again under Mary, and who was ready again to cast it off at the
will of Mary's successor. If worship and belief were indeed spiritual things, if they had any
semblance of connexion with divine realities, men must have felt that it was impossible to
put them on and off at a king's caprice. It was this, even more than the natural pity which
they raised, that gave their weight to the Protestant martyrdoms under Mary. They stood out
in emphatic protest against the doctrine of local religion, of a belief dictated by the will
of kings. From the Primate of the Church to the "blind girl" who perished at Colchester, three
hundred were found in England who chose rather to go to the fire than to take up again at the
Queen's will what their individual conscience had renounced as a lie against God.

[Sidenote: Calvin.]

But from the actual assertion of such a right of the individual conscience to find and hold
what was true, even those who witnessed for it by their death would have shrunk. Driven by
sheer force of fact from the theory of a national and royal faith, men still shuddered to stand
alone. The old doctrine of a Catholic Christianity flung over them its spell. Rome indeed they
looked on as Antichrist, but the doctrine which Rome had held so long and so firmly, the doctrine
that truth should be coextensive with the world and not limited by national boundaries, that
the Church was one in all countries and among all peoples, that there was a Christendom which
embraced all kingdoms and a Christian law that ruled peoples and kings, became more and more
the doctrine of Rome's bitterest opponents. It was this doctrine which found its embodiment
in John Calvin, a young French scholar, driven in early manhood from his own country by the
persecution of Francis the First. Calvin established himself at Basle, and produced there in
1535 at the age of twenty-six a book which was to form the theology of the Huguenot churches,
his "Institutes of the Christian Religion." What was really original in this work was Calvin's
doctrine of the organization of the Church and of its relation to the State. The base of the
Christian republic was with him the Christian man, elected and called of God, preserved by
His grace from the power of sin, predestinate to eternal life. Every such Christian man is
in himself a priest, and every group of such men is a Church, self-governing, independent of
all save God, supreme in its authority over all matters ecclesiastical and spiritual. The constitution
of such a church, where each member as a Christian was equal before God, necessarily took a
democratic form. In Calvin's theory of Church government it is the Church which itself elects
its lay elders and lay deacons for purposes of administration; it is with the approval and
consent of the Church that elders and deacons with the existing body of pastors elect new ministers.
It is through these officers that the Church exercises its power of the keys, the power of
diffusing the truth and the power of correcting error. To the minister belong the preaching
of the word and the direction of all religious instruction; to the body of ministers belong
the interpretation of scripture and the decision of doctrine. On the other hand the administration
of discipline, the supervision of the moral conduct of each professing Christian, the admonition
of the erring, the excommunication and exclusion from the body of the Church of the unbelieving
and the utterly unworthy, belong to the Consistory, the joint assembly of ministers and elders.
To this discipline princes as well as common men are alike subject; princes as well as common
men must take their doctrine from the ministers of the Church.

[Sidenote: Calvinism.]

The claims of the older faith to spiritual and ecclesiastical supremacy over the powers of
earth reappeared in this theory. Calvin like the Papacy ignored all national independence,
all pretensions of peoples as such to create their own system of church doctrine or church
government. Doctrine and government he held to be already laid down in the words of the Bible,
and all questions that rose out of those words came under the decision of the ecclesiastical
body of ministers. Wherever a reformed religion appeared, there was provided for it a simple
but orderly organization which in its range and effectiveness rivalled that of the older Catholicism.
On the other hand this organization rested on a wholly new basis; spiritual and ecclesiastical
power came from below not from above; the true sovereign in this Christian state was not Pope
or Bishop but the Christian man. Despotic as the authority of pastor and elders seemed, pastor
and elders were alike the creation of the whole congregation, and their judgement could in
the last resort be adopted or set aside by it. Such a system stood out in bold defiance against
the tendencies of the day. On its religious side it came into conflict with that principle
of nationality, of ecclesiastical as well as civil subjection to the prince, on which the reformed
Churches and above all the Church of England had till now been built up. As a vast and consecrated
democracy it stood in contrast with the whole social and political framework of the European
nations. Grave as we may count the faults of Calvinism, alien as its temper may in many ways
be from the temper of the modern world, it is in Calvinism that the modern world strikes its
roots, for it was Calvinism that first revealed the worth and dignity of Man. Called of God,
and heir of heaven, the trader at his counter and the digger in his field suddenly rose into
equality with the noble and the king.

[Sidenote: Calvin and the Exiles.]

It was this system that Calvin by a singular fortune was able to put into actual working in
the little city of Geneva, where the party of the Reformation had become master and called
him in 1536 to be their spiritual head. Driven out but again recalled, his influence made Geneva
from 1541 the centre of the Protestant world. The refugees who crowded to the little town from
persecution in France, in the Netherlands, in England, found there an exact and formal doctrine,
a rigid discipline of manners and faith, a system of church government, a form of church worship,
stripped, as they held, of the last remnant of the superstitions of the past. Calvin himself
with his austere and frugal life, his enormous industry, his power of government, his quick
decision, his undoubting self-confidence, his unswerving will, remained for three-and-twenty
years till his death in 1564 supreme over Protestant opinion. His influence told heavily on
England. From the hour of Cromwell's fall the sympathies of the English reformers had drawn
them, not to the Lutheran Churches of North Germany, but to the more progressive Churches of
the Rhineland and the Netherlands: and on the critical question of the Lord's Supper which
mainly divided the two great branches of the Reformation Cranmer and his partizans became more
definitely anti-sacramentarian as the years went by. At Edward's death the exiles showed their
tendencies by seeking refuge not with the Lutheran Churches of North Germany but with the Calvinistic
Churches of Switzerland or the Rhine; and contact with such leaders as Bullinger at Zürich
or Calvin at Geneva could hardly fail to give fresh vigour to the party which longed for a
closer union with the foreign churches and a more open breach with the past.

[Sidenote: The troubles at Frankfort.]

The results of this contact first showed themselves at Frankfort. At the instigation of Whittingham,
who in Elizabeth's days became Dean of Durham, a body of English exiles that had found shelter
there resolved to reform both worship and discipline. The obnoxious usages were expunged from
the Prayer-Book, omissions were made in the communion service, a minister and deacons chosen,
and rules drawn up for church government after the Genevan model. Free at last "from all dregs
of superstitious ceremonies" the Frankfort refugees thanked God "that had given them such a
church in a strange land wherein they might hear God's holy word preached, the sacraments rightly
ministered, and discipline used, which in their own country could never be obtained." But their
invitation to the other English exiles to join them in the enjoyment of these blessings met
with a steady repulse. Lever and the exiles at Zürich refused to come unless they might "altogether
serve and praise God as freely and uprightly as the order last taken in the Church of England
permitteth and presenteth, for we are fully determined to admit and use no other." The main

 The post and
the knighthood which accompanied it hardly compensated for the yoke which Northumberland's
pride laid upon all who served him, or for the risks in which his ambition involved them. Cecil
saw with a fatal clearness the silent opposition of the whole realm to the system of the Protectorate,
and the knowledge of this convinced him that the Duke's schemes for a change in the succession
were destined to failure. On the disclosure of the plot to set Mary aside he withdrew for some
days from the court, and even meditated flight from the country, till fear of the young king's
wrath drew him back to share in the submission of his fellow-counsellors and to pledge himself
with them to carry the new settlement into effect. But Northumberland had no sooner quitted
London than Cecil became the soul of the intrigues by which the royal Council declared themselves
in Mary's favour. His desertion of the Duke secured him pardon from the Queen, and though he
was known to be in heart "a heretic" he continued at court, conformed like Elizabeth to the
established religion, confessed and attended mass. Cecil was employed in bringing Pole to England
and in attending him in embassies abroad. But his caution held him aloof from any close connexion
with public affairs. He busied himself in building at Burghley and in the culture of the Church
lands he had won from Edward the Sixth, while he drew closer to the girl who alone could rescue
England from the misgovernment of Mary's rule. Even before the Queen's death it was known that
Cecil would be the chief counsellor of the coming reign. "I am told for certain," the Spanish
ambassador wrote to Philip after a visit to Elizabeth during the last hours of Mary's life,
"that Cecil who was secretary to King Edward will be her secretary also. He has the character
of a prudent and virtuous man, although a heretic." But it was only from a belief that Cecil
retained at heart the convictions of his earlier days that men could call him a heretic. In
all outer matters of faith or worship he conformed to the religion of the state.

[Sidenote: The Politicals.]

It is idle to charge Cecil, or the mass of Englishmen who conformed with him in turn to the
religion of Henry, of Edward, of Mary, and of Elizabeth, with baseness or hypocrisy. They followed
the accepted doctrine of the time--that every realm, through its rulers, had the sole right
of determining what should be the form of religion within its bounds. What the Marian persecution
was gradually pressing on such men was a conviction, not of the falsehood of such a doctrine,
but of the need of limiting it. Under Henry, under Edward, under Mary, no distinction had been
drawn between inner belief and outer conformity. Every English subject was called upon to adjust
his conscience as well as his conduct to the varying policy of the state. But the fires of
Smithfield had proved that obedience such as this could not be exacted save by a persecution
which filled all England with horror. Such a persecution indeed failed in the very end for
which it was wrought. Instead of strengthening religious unity, it gave a new force to religious
separation; it enlisted the conscience of the zealot in the cause of resistance; it secured
the sympathy of the great mass of waverers to those who withstood the civil power. To Cecil,
as to the purely political statesmen of whom he was the type, such a persecution seemed as
needless as it was mischievous. Conformity indeed was necessary, for men could as yet conceive
of no state without a religion or of civil obedience apart from compliance with the religious
order of the state. But only outer conformity was needed. That no man should set up a worship
other than that of the nation at large, that every subject should duly attend at the national
worship, Cecil believed to be essential to public order. But he saw no need for prying into
the actual beliefs of those who conformed to the religious laws of the realm, nor did he think
that such beliefs could be changed by the fear of punishment. While refusing freedom of worship
therefore, Cecil, like Elizabeth, was ready to concede freedom of conscience. And in this concession
we can hardly doubt that the bulk of Englishmen went with him. Catholics shared with Protestants
the horror of Mary's persecution. To Protestantism indeed the horror of the persecution had
done much to give a force such as it had never had before. The number of Protestants grew with
every murder done in the cause of Catholicism. But they still remained a small part of the
realm. What the bulk of Englishmen had been driven to by the martyrdoms was not a change of
creed, but a longing for religious peace and for such a system of government as, without destroying
the spiritual oneness of the nation, would render a religious peace possible. And such a system
of government Cecil and Elizabeth were prepared to give.

[Sidenote: Mary's death.]

We may ascribe to Cecil's counsels somewhat of the wise patience with which Elizabeth waited
for the coming crown. Her succession was assured, and the throng of visitors to her presence
showed a general sense that the Queen's end was near. Mary stood lonely and desolate in her
realm. "I will not be buried while I am living, as my sister was," Elizabeth said in later
years. "Do I not know how during her life every one hastened to me at Hatfield?" The bloodshed
indeed went on more busily than ever. It had spread now from bishops and priests to the people
itself, and the sufferers were sent in batches to the flames. In a single day thirteen victims,
two of them women, were burned at Stratford-le-Bow. Seventy-three Protestants of Colchester
were dragged through the streets of London tied to a single rope. A new commission for the
suppression of heresy was exempted by royal authority from all restrictions of law which fettered
its activity. But the work of terror broke down before the silent revolt of the whole nation.
The persecution failed even to put an end to heretical worship. Not only do we find ministers
moving about in London and Kent to hold "secret meetings of the Gospellers," but up to the
middle of 1555 four parishes in Essex still persisted in using the English-Prayer Book. Open
marks of sympathy at last began to be offered to the victims at the stake. "There were seven
men burned in Smithfield the twenty-eighth day of July," a Londoner writes in 1558, "a fearful
and a cruel proclamation being made that under pain of present death no man should either approach
nigh unto them, touch them, neither speak to them nor comfort them. Yet were they so comfortably
taken by the hand and so goodly comforted, notwithstanding that fearful proclamation and the
present threatenings of the sheriffs and serjeants, that the adversaries themselves were astonished."
The crowd round the fire shouted "Amen" to the martyrs' prayers, and prayed with them that
God would strengthen them. What galled Mary yet more was the ill will of the Pope. Paul the
Fourth still adhered to his demand for full restoration of the Church lands, and held England
as only partly reconciled to the Holy See. He was hostile to Philip; he was yet more hostile
to Pole. At this moment he dealt a last blow at the Queen by depriving Pole of his legatine
power, and was believed to be on the point of calling him to answer a charge of heresy. Even
when she was freed from part of her troubles in the autumn of 1558 by the opening of conferences
for peace at Cambray a fresh danger disclosed itself. The demands of the queen's envoys for
the restoration of Calais met with so stubborn a refusal from France that it seemed as if England
would be left alone to bear the brunt of a future struggle, for Mary's fierce pride, had she
lived, could hardly have bowed to the surrender of the town. But the Queen was dying. Her health
had long been weak, and the miseries and failure of her reign hastened the progress of disease.
Already enfeebled, she was attacked as winter drew near by a fever which was at this time ravaging
the country, and on the seventeenth of November, 1558, she breathed her last.

CHAPTER III

THE ENGLAND OF ELIZABETH

1558-1561

[Sidenote: Elizabeth's accession.]

Tradition still points out the tree in Hatfield Park beneath which Elizabeth was sitting when
she received the news of her peaceful accession to the throne. She fell on her knees, and drawing
a long breath, exclaimed at last, "It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes."
To the last these words remained stamped on the golden coinage of the Queen. The sense never
left her that her preservation and her reign were the issues of a direct interposition of God.
Daring and self-confident indeed as was her temper, it was awed into seriousness by the weight
of responsibility which fell on her with her sister's death. Never had the fortunes of England
sunk to a lower ebb. Dragged at the heels of Philip into a useless and ruinous war, the country
was left without an ally save Spain. The loss of Calais gave France the mastery of the Channel,
and seemed to English eyes "to introduce the French King within the threshold of our house."
"If God start not forth to the helm," wrote the Council in an appeal to the country, "we be
at the point of greatest misery that can happen to any people, which is to become thrall to
a foreign nation." Ireland too was torn with civil war, while Scotland, always a danger in
the north, had become formidable through the French marriage of its queen. In presence of enemies
such as these, the country lay helpless, without army or fleet, or the means of manning one,
for the treasury, already drained by the waste of Edward's reign, had been utterly exhausted
by the restoration of the Church lands in possession of the Crown and by the cost of the war
with France. But formidable as was the danger from without, it was little to the danger from
within. The country was humiliated by defeat and brought to the verge of rebellion by the bloodshed
and misgovernment of Mary's reign. The social discontent which had been trampled down for a
while by the horsemen of Somerset remained a menace to further order. Above all, the religious
strife had passed beyond hope of reconciliation now that the reformers were parted from their
opponents by the fires of Smithfield and the party of the New Learning all but dissolved. The
more earnest Catholics were bound helplessly to Rome. The temper of the Protestants, burned
at home or driven into exile abroad, had become a fiercer thing, and the Calvinistic refugees
were pouring back from Geneva with dreams of revolutionary changes in Church and State.

[Sidenote: Her religious policy.]

It was with the religious difficulty that Elizabeth was called first to deal; and the way in
which she dealt with it showed at once the peculiar bent of her mind. The young Queen was not
without a sense of religion; at moments of peril or deliverance throughout her reign her acknowledgements
of a divine protection took a strange depth and earnestness. But she was almost wholly destitute
of spiritual emotion, or of any consciousness of the vast questions with which theology strove
to deal. While the world around her was being swayed more and more by theological beliefs and
controversies, Elizabeth was absolutely untouched by them. She was a child of the Italian Renascence
rather than of the New Learning of Colet or Erasmus, and her attitude towards the enthusiasm
of her time was that of Lorenzo de' Medici towards Savonarola. Her mind was untroubled by the
spiritual problems which were vexing the minds around her; to Elizabeth indeed they were not
only unintelligible, they were a little ridiculous. She had been brought up under Henry amidst
the ritual of the older Church; under Edward she had submitted to the English Prayer-Book,
and drunk in much of the Protestant theology; under Mary she was ready after a slight resistance
to conform again to the mass. Her temper remained unchanged through the whole course of her
reign. She showed the same intellectual contempt for the superstition of the Romanist as for
the bigotry of the Protestant. While she ordered Catholic images to be flung into the fire,
she quizzed the Puritans as "brethren in Christ." But she had no sort of religious aversion
from either Puritan or Papist. The Protestants grumbled at the Catholic nobles whom she admitted
to the presence. The Catholics grumbled at the Protestant statesmen whom she called to her
council-board. To Elizabeth on the other hand the arrangement was the most natural thing in
the world. She looked at theological differences in a purely political light. She agreed with
Henry the Fourth that a kingdom was well worth a mass. It seemed an obvious thing to her to
hold out hopes of conversion as a means of deceiving Philip, or to gain a point in negotiation
by restoring the crucifix to her chapel. The first interest in her own mind was the interest
of public order, and she never could understand how it could fail to be the first in every
one's mind.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth's toleration.]

One memorable change marked the nobler side of the policy she brought with her to the throne.
Elizabeth's accession was at once followed by a close of the religious persecution. Whatever
might be the changes that awaited the country, conformity was no longer to be enforced by the
penalty of death. At a moment when Philip was presiding at autos-de-fé and Henry of France
plotting a massacre of his Huguenot subjects, such a resolve was a gain for humanity as well
as a step towards religious toleration. And from this resolve Elizabeth never wavered. Through
all her long reign, save a few Anabaptists whom the whole nation loathed as blasphemers of
God and dreaded as enemies of social order, no heretic was "sent to the fire." It was a far
greater gain for humanity when the Queen declared her will to meddle in no way with the consciences
of her subjects. She would hear of no inquisition into a man's private thoughts on religious
matters or into his personal religion. Cecil could boldly assert in her name at a later time
the right of every Englishman to perfect liberty of religious opinion. Such a liberty of opinion
by no means implied liberty of public worship. On the incompatibility of freedom of worship
with public order Catholic and Protestant were as yet at one. The most advanced reformers did
not dream of contending for a right to stand apart from the national religion. What they sought
was to make the national religion their own. The tendency of the reformation had been to press
for the religious as well as the political unity of every state. Even Calvin looked forward
to the winning of the nations to a purer faith without a suspicion that the religious movement
which he headed would end in establishing the right even of the children of "antichrist" to
worship as they would in a Protestant commonwealth. If the Protestant lords in Scotland had
been driven to assert a right of nonconformity, if the Huguenots of France were following their
example, it was with no thought of asserting the right of every man to worship God as he would.
From the claim of such a right Knox or Coligni would have shrunk with even greater horror than
Elizabeth. What they aimed at was simply the establishment of a truce till by force or persuasion
they could win the realms that tolerated them for their own. In this matter therefore Elizabeth
was at one with every statesman of her day. While granting freedom of conscience to her subjects,
she was resolute to exact an outward conformity to the established religion.

[Sidenote: Religion unchanged.]

But men watched curiously to see what religion the Queen would establish. Even before her accession
the keen eye of the Spanish ambassador had noted her "great admiration for the king her father's
mode of carrying on matters," as a matter of ill omen for the interests of Catholicism. He
had marked that the ladies about her and the counsellors on whom she seemed about to rely were,
like Cecil, "held to be heretics." "I fear much," he wrote, "that in religion she will not
go right." As keen an instinct warned the Protestants that the tide had turned. The cessation
of the burnings, and the release of all persons imprisoned for religion, seemed to receive
their interpretation when Elizabeth on her entry into London kissed an English Bible which
the citizens presented to her and promised "diligently to read therein." The exiles at Strassburg
or Geneva flocked home with wild dreams of a religious revolution and of vengeance upon their
foes. But hopes and fears alike met a startling check. For months there was little change in
either government or religion. If Elizabeth introduced Cecil and his kinsman, Sir Nicholas
Bacon, to her council-board, she retained as yet most of her sister's advisers. The Mass went
on as before, and the Queen was regular in her attendance at it. As soon as the revival of
Protestantism showed itself in controversial sermons and insults to the priesthood it was bridled
by a proclamation which forbade unlicensed preaching and enforced silence on the religious
controversy. Elizabeth showed indeed a distaste for the elevation of the Host, and allowed
the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments to be used in English. But months passed after
her accession before she would go further than this. A royal proclamation which ordered the
existing form of worship to be observed "till consultation might be had in Parliament by the
Queen and the Three Estates" startled the prelates; and only one bishop could be found to assist
at the coronation of Elizabeth. But no change was made in the ceremonies of the coronation;
the Queen took the customary oath to observe the liberties of the Church, and conformed to
the Catholic ritual. There was little in fact to excite any reasonable alarm among the adherents
of the older faith, or any reasonable hope among the adherents of the new. "I will do," the
Queen said, "as my father did." Instead of the reforms of Edward and the Protectorate, the
Protestants saw themselves thrown back on the reforms of Henry the Eighth. Even Henry's system
indeed seemed too extreme for Elizabeth. Her father had at any rate broken boldly from the
Papacy. But the first work of the Queen was to open negotiations for her recognition with the
Papal Court.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth and Philip.]

What shaped Elizabeth's course in fact was hard necessity. She found herself at war with France
and Scotland, and her throne threatened by the claim of the girl who linked the two countries,
the claim of Mary Stuart, at once Queen of Scotland and wife of the Dauphin Francis. On Elizabeth's
accession Mary and Francis assumed by the French king's order the arms and style of English
sovereigns: and if war continued it was clear that their pretensions would be backed by Henry's
forces as well as by the efforts of the Scots. Against such a danger Philip of Spain was Elizabeth's
only ally. Philip's policy was at this time a purely conservative one. The vast schemes of
ambition which had so often knit both Pope and Protestants, Germany and France, against his
father were set aside by the young king. His position indeed was very different from that of
Charles the Fifth. He was not Emperor. He had little weight in Germany. Even in Italy his influence
was less than his father's. He had lost with Mary's death the crown of England. His most valuable
possessions outside Spain, the provinces of the Netherlands, were disaffected to a foreign
rule. All the king therefore aimed at was to keep his own. But the Netherlands were hard to
keep: and with France mistress of England as of Scotland, and so mistress of the Channel, to
keep them would be impossible. Sheer necessity forbade Philip to suffer the union of the three
crowns of the west on the head of a French king; and the French marriage of Mary Stuart pledged
him to oppose her pretensions and support Elizabeth's throne. For a moment he even dreamed
of meeting the union of France with Scotland by that union of England with Spain which had
been seen under Mary. He offered Elizabeth his hand. The match was a more natural one than
Philip's union with her sister, for the young king's age was not far from her own. The offer
however was courteously put aside, for Elizabeth had no purpose of lending England to the ambition
of Spain, nor was it possible for her to repeat her sister's unpopular experiment. But Philip
remained firm in his support of her throne. He secured for her the allegiance of the Catholics
within her realm, who looked to him as their friend while they distrusted France as an ally
of heretics. His envoys supported her cause in the negotiations at Cateau-Cambrésis; he suffered
her to borrow money and provide herself with arms in his provinces of the Netherlands. At such
a crisis Elizabeth could not afford to alienate Philip by changes which would roughly dispel
his hopes of retaining her within the bounds of Catholicism.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth and the Papacy.]

Nor is there any sign that Elizabeth had resolved on a defiance of the Papacy. She was firm
indeed to assert her father's claim of supremacy over the clergy and her own title to the throne.
But the difficulties in the way of an accommodation on these points were such as could be settled
by negotiation; and, acting on Cecil's counsel, Elizabeth announced her accession to the Pope.
The announcement showed her purpose of making no violent break in the relations of England
with the Papal See. But between Elizabeth and the Papacy lay the fatal question of the Divorce.
To acknowledge the young Queen was not only to own her mother's marriage, but to cancel the
solemn judgement of the Holy See in Catharine's favour and its solemn assertion of her own
bastardy. The temper of Paul the Fourth took fire at the news. He reproached Elizabeth with
her presumption in ascending the throne, recalled the Papal judgement which pronounced her
illegitimate, and summoned her to submit her claims to his tribunal. Much of this indignation
was no doubt merely diplomatic. If the Pope listened to the claims of Mary Stuart, which were
urged on him by the French Court, it was probably only with the purpose of using them to bring
pressure to bear on Elizabeth and on the stubborn country which still refused to restore its
lands to the Church and to make the complete submission which Paul demanded. But Cecil and
the Queen knew that, even had they been willing to pay such a price for the crown, it was beyond
their power to bring England to pay it. The form too in which Paul had couched his answer admitted
of no compromise. The summons to submit the Queen's claim of succession to the judgement of
Rome produced its old effect. Elizabeth was driven, as Henry had been driven, to assert the
right of the nation to decide on questions which affected its very life. A Parliament which
met in January, 1559, acknowledged the legitimacy of Elizabeth and her title to the crown.

[Sidenote: The Supremacy re-established.]

Such an acknowledgement in the teeth of the Papal repudiation of Anne Boleyn's marriage carried
with it a repudiation of the supremacy of the Papacy. It was in vain that the clergy in convocation
unanimously adopted five articles which affirmed their faith in transubstantiation, their acceptance
of the supreme authority of the Popes as "Christ's vicars and supreme rulers of the Church,"
and their resolve "that the authority in all matters of faith and discipline belongs and ought
to belong only to the pastors of the Church, and not to laymen." It was in vain that the bishops
unanimously opposed the Bill for restoring the royal supremacy when it was brought before the
Lords. The "ancient jurisdiction of the Crown over the Estate ecclesiastical and spiritual"
was restored; the Acts which under Mary re-established the independent jurisdiction and legislation
of the Church were repealed; and the clergy were called on to swear to the supremacy of the
Crown and to abjure all foreign authority and jurisdiction. Further Elizabeth had no personal
wish to go. A third of the Council and at least two-thirds of the people were as opposed to
any radical changes in religion as the Queen. Among the gentry the older and wealthier were
on the conservative side, and only the younger and meaner on the other. In the Parliament itself
Sir Thomas White protested that "it was unjust that a religion begun in such a miraculous way
and established by such grave men should be abolished by a set of beardless boys." Yet even
this "beardless" Parliament had shown a strong conservatism. The Bill which re-established
the royal supremacy met with violent opposition in the Commons, and only passed through Cecil's
adroit manoeuvring.

[Sidenote: Prayer-Book restored.]

But the steps which Elizabeth had taken made it necessary to go further. If the Protestants
were the less numerous, they were the abler and the more vigorous party, and the break with
Rome threw Elizabeth, whether she would or no, on their support. It was a support that could
only be bought by theological concessions, and above all by the surrender of the Mass; for
to every Protestant the Mass was identified with the fires of Smithfield, while the Prayer-Book
which it had displaced was hallowed by the memories of the Martyrs. The pressure of the reforming
party indeed would have been fruitless had the Queen still been hampered by danger from France.
Fortunately for their cause the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis at this juncture freed Elizabeth's
hands. By this treaty, which was practically concluded in March 1559, Calais was left in French
holding on the illusory pledge of its restoration to England eight years later; but peace was
secured and the danger of a war of succession, in which Mary Stuart would be backed by the
arms of France, for a while averted. Secure from without, Elizabeth could venture to buy the
support of the Protestants within her realm by the restoration of the English Prayer-Book.
Such a measure was far indeed from being meant as an open break with Catholicism. The use of
the vulgar tongue in public worship was still popular with a large part of the Catholic world;
and the Queen did her best by the alterations she made in Edward's Prayer-Book to strip it
of its more Protestant tone. To the bulk of the people the book must have seemed merely a rendering
of the old service in their own tongue. As the English Catholics afterwards represented at
Rome when excusing their own use of it, the Prayer-Book "contained neither impiety nor false
doctrine; its prayers were those of the Catholic Church, altered only so far as to omit the
merits and intercession of the saints." On such a concession as this the Queen felt it safe
to venture in spite of the stubborn opposition of the spiritual estate. She ordered a disputation
to be held in Westminster Abbey before the Houses on the question, and when the disputation
ended in the refusal of the bishops to proceed, an Act of Uniformity, which was passed in spite
of their strenuous opposition, restored at the close of April the last Prayer-Book of Edward,
and enforced its use on the clergy on pain of deprivation.

[Sidenote: Pius the Fourth.]

At Rome the news of these changes stirred a fiercer wrath in Paul the Fourth, and his threats
of excommunication were only held in check by the protests of Philip. The policy of the Spanish
king still bound him to Elizabeth's cause, for the claims of Mary Stuart had been reserved
in the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis and the refusal of France to abandon them held Spain to its
alliance with the Queen. Vexed as he was at the news of the Acts which re-established the supremacy,
Philip ordered his ambassador to assure Elizabeth he was as sure a friend as ever, and to soothe
the resentment of the English Catholics if it threatened to break out into revolt. He showed
the same temper in his protest against action at Rome. Paul had however resolved to carry out
his threats when his death and the interregnum which followed gave Elizabeth a fresh respite.
His successor, Pius the Fourth, was of milder temper and leaned rather to a policy of conciliation.
Decisive indeed as the Queen's action may seem in modern eyes, it was far from being held as
decisive at the time. The Act of Supremacy might be regarded as having been forced upon Elizabeth
by Paul's repudiation of her title to the crown. The alterations which were made by the Queen's
authority in the Prayer-Book showed a wish to conciliate those who clung to the older faith.
It was clear that Elizabeth had no mind merely to restore the system of the Protectorate. She
set up again the royal supremacy, but she dropped the words "Head of the Church" from the royal
title. The forty-two Articles of Protestant doctrine which Cranmer had drawn up were left in
abeyance. If the Queen had had her will, she would have retained the celibacy of the clergy
and restored the use of crucifixes in the churches.

[Sidenote: The Clergy and the oath.]

The caution and hesitation with which she enforced on the clergy the oath required by the Act
of Supremacy showed Elizabeth's wish to avoid the opening of a religious strife. The higher
dignitaries indeed were unsparingly dealt with. The bishops, who with a single exception refused
to take the oath, were imprisoned and deprived. The same measure was dealt out to most of the
archdeacons and deans. But with the mass of the parish priests a very different course was
taken. The Commissioners appointed in May 1559 were found to be too zealous in October, and
several of the clerical members were replaced by cooler laymen. The great bulk of the clergy
seem neither to have refused nor to have consented to the oath, but to have left the Commissioners'
summons unheeded and to have stayed quietly at home. Of the nine thousand four hundred beneficed
clergy only a tenth presented themselves before the Commissioners. Of those who attended and
refused the oath a hundred and eighty-nine were deprived, but many of the most prominent went
unharmed. At Winchester, though the dean and canons of the cathedral, the warden and fellows
of the college, and the master of St. Cross, refused the oath, only four of these appear in
the list of deprivations. Even the few who suffered proved too many for the purpose of the
Queen. In the more remote parts of the kingdom the proceedings of the visitors threatened to
wake the religious strife which she was endeavouring to lull to sleep. On the northern border,
where the great nobles, Lord Dacres and the Earls of Cumberland and Westmoreland, were zealous
Catholics, and refused to let the bishop "meddle with them," the clergy held stubbornly aloof.
At Durham a parson was able to protest without danger that the Pope alone had power in spiritual
matters. In Hereford the town turned out to receive in triumph a party of priests from the
west who had refused the oath. The University of Oxford took refuge in sullen opposition. In
spite of pressure from the Protestant prelates, who occupied the sees vacated by the deprived
bishops, Elizabeth was firm in her policy of patience, and in December she ordered the Commissioners
in both provinces to suspend their proceedings.

[Sidenote: The Religious Chaos.]

In part indeed of her effort she was foiled by the bitterness of the reformers. The London
mob tore down the crosses in the streets. Her attempt to retain the crucifix, or to enforce
the celibacy of the priesthood, fell dead before the opposition of the Protestant clergy. But
to the mass of the nation the compromise of Elizabeth seems to have been fairly acceptable.
They saw but little change. Their old vicar or rector in almost every case remained in his
parsonage and ministered in his church. The new Prayer-Book was for the most part an English
rendering of the old service. Even the more zealous adherents of Catholicism held as yet that
in complying with the order for attendance at public worship "there could be nothing positively
unlawful." Where party feeling ran high indeed the matter was sometimes settled by a compromise.
A priest would celebrate mass at his parsonage for the more rigid Catholics, and administer
the new communion in church to the more rigid Protestants. Sometimes both parties knelt together
at the same altar-rails, the one to receive hosts consecrated by the priest at home after the
old usage, the other wafers consecrated in church after the new. In many parishes of the north
no change of service was made at all. Even where priest and people conformed it was often with
a secret belief that better times were soon to bring back the older observances. As late as
1569 some of the chief parishes in Sussex were still merely bending to the storm of heresy.
"In the church of Arundel certain altars do stand yet, to the offence of the godly, which murmur
and speak much against the same. In the town of Battle when a preacher doth come and speak
anything against the Pope's doctrine they will not abide but get them out of the church. They
have yet in the diocese in many places thereof images hidden and other popish ornaments ready
to set up the mass again within twenty-four hours warning. In many places they keep yet their
chalices, looking to have mass again." Nor was there much new teaching as yet to stir up strife
in those who clung to the older faith. Elizabeth had no mind for controversies which would
set her people by the ears. "In many churches they have no sermons, not one in seven years,
and some not one in twelve." The older priests of Mary's days held their peace. The Protestant
preachers were few and hampered by the exaction of licences. In many cases churches had "neither
parson, vicar, nor curate, but a sorry reader." Even where the new clergy were of higher intellectual
stamp they were often unpopular. Many of those who were set in the place of the displaced clergy
roused disgust by their violence and greed. Chapters plundered their own estates by leases
and fines and by felling timber. The marriages of the clergy became a scandal, which was increased
when the gorgeous vestments of the old worship were cut up into gowns and bodices for the priests'
wives. The new services sometimes turned into scenes of utter disorder where the ministers
wore what dress they pleased and the communicant stood or sat as he liked; while the old altars
were broken down and the communion-table was often a bare board upon trestles. Only in the
few places where the more zealous of the reformers had settled was there any religious instruction.
"In many places," it was reported after ten years of the Queen's rule, "the people cannot yet
say their commandments, and in some not the articles of their belief." Naturally enough, the
bulk of Englishmen were found to be "utterly devoid of religion," and came to church "as to
a May game."

[Sidenote: Parker.]

To modern eyes the Church under Elizabeth would seem little better than a religious chaos.
But England was fairly used to religious confusion, for the whole machinery of English religion
had been thrown out of gear by the rapid and radical changes of the last two reigns. And to
the Queen's mind a religious chaos was a far less difficulty than the parting of the nation
into two warring Churches which would have been brought about by a more rigorous policy. She
trusted to time to bring about greater order; and she found in Matthew Parker, whom Pole's
death at the moment of her accession enabled her to raise to the See of Canterbury, an agent
in the reorganization of the Church whose patience and moderation were akin to her own. To
the difficulties which Parker found indeed in the temper of the reformers and their opponents
new difficulties were sometimes added by the freaks of the Queen herself. If she had no convictions,
she had tastes; and her taste revolted from the bareness of Protestant ritual and above all
from the marriage of priests. "Leave that alone," she shouted to Dean Nowell from the royal
closet as he denounced the use of images--"stick to your text, Master Dean, leave that alone!"
When Parker was firm in resisting the introduction of the crucifix or of celibacy, Elizabeth
showed her resentment by an insult to his wife. Married ladies were addressed at this time
as "Madam," unmarried ladies as "Mistress"; but the marriage of the clergy was still unsanctioned
by law, for Elizabeth had refused to revive the statute of Edward by which it was allowed,
and the position of a priest's wife was legally a very doubtful one. When Mrs. Parker therefore
advanced at the close of a sumptuous entertainment at Lambeth to take leave of the Queen, Elizabeth
feigned a momentary hesitation. "Madam," she said at last, "I may not call you, and Mistress
I am loath to call you; however, I thank you for your good cheer." But freaks of this sort
had little real weight beside the steady support which the Queen gave to the Primate in his
work of order. The vacant sees were filled with men from among the exiles, for the most part
learned and able, though far more Protestant than the bulk of their flocks; the plunder of
the Church by the nobles was checked; and at the close of 1559 England seemed to settle quietly
down in a religious peace.

[Sidenote: England Protestant.]

But cautious as had been Elizabeth's movements and skilfully as she had hidden the real drift
of her measures from the bulk of the people, the religion of England was changed. The old service
was gone. The old bishops were gone. The royal supremacy was again restored. All connexion
with Rome was again broken. The repudiation of the Papacy and the restoration of the Prayer-Book
in the teeth of the unanimous opposition of the priesthood had established the great principle
of the Reformation, that the form of a nation's faith should be determined not by the clergy
but by the nation itself. Different therefore as was the temper of the government, the religious
attitude of England was once more what it had been under the Protectorate. At the most critical
moment of the strife between the new religion and the old England had ranged itself on the
side of Protestantism. It was only the later history of Elizabeth's reign which was to reveal
of what mighty import this Protestantism of England was to prove. Had England remained Catholic
the freedom of the Dutch Republic would have been impossible. No Henry the Fourth would have
reigned in France to save French Protestantism by the Edict of Nantes. No struggle over far-off
seas would have broken the power of Spain and baffled the hopes which the House of Austria
cherished of winning a mastery over the western world. Nor could Calvinism have found a home
across the northern border. The first result of the religious change in England was to give
a new impulse to the religious revolution in Scotland.

[Sidenote: Scotch Calvinism.]

In the midst of anxieties at home Elizabeth had been keenly watching the fortunes of the north.
We have seen how the policy of Mary of Guise had given life and force to the Scottish Reformation.
Not only had the Regent given shelter to the exiled Protestants and looked on at the diffusion
of the new doctrines, but her "fair words" had raised hopes that the government itself would
join the ranks of the reformers. Mary of Guise had regarded the religious movement in a purely
political light. It was as enemies of Mary Tudor that she gave shelter to the exiles, and it
was to avoid a national strife which would have left Scotland open to English attack in the
war which closed Mary's reign that the Regent gave "fair words" to the preachers. But with
the first Covenant, with the appearance of the Lords of the Congregation in an avowed league
in the heart of the land, with their rejection of the state worship and their resolve to enforce
a change of religion, her attitude suddenly altered. To the Regent the new religion was henceforth
but a garb under which the old quarrel of the nobles was breaking out anew against the Crown.
Smooth as were her words, men knew that Mary of Guise was resolute to withstand religious change.
But Elizabeth's elevation to the throne gave a new fire to the reformers. Conservative as her
earlier policy seemed, the instinct of the Protestants told them that the new Queen's accession
was a triumph for Protestantism. The Lords at once demanded that all bishops should be chosen
by the nobles and gentry, each priest by his parish, and that divine service should be henceforth
in the vulgar tongue. These demands were rejected by the bishops, while the royal court in
May 1559 summoned the preachers to its bar and on their refusal to appear condemned them to
banishment as rebels. The sentence was a signal for open strife. The Protestants, whose strength
as yet lay mainly in Fife, had gathered in great numbers at Perth, and the news stirred them
to an outbreak of fury. The images were torn down from the churches, the monasteries of the
town were sacked and demolished. The riot at Perth was followed by a general rising. The work
of destruction went on along the east coast and through the Lowlands, while the "Congregation"
sprang up everywhere in its train. The Mass came to an end. The Prayer-Book of Edward was heard
in the churches. The Lords occupied the capital and found its burghers as zealous in the cause
of reformation as themselves. Throughout all these movements the Lords had been in communication
with England, for the old jealousy of English annexation was now lost in a jealousy of French
conquest. Their jealousy had solid grounds. The marriage of Mary Stuart with the Dauphin of
France had been celebrated in April 1558 and three days before the wedding the girl-queen had
been brought to convey her kingdom away by deed to the House of Valois. The deed was kept secret;
but Mary's demand of the crown matrimonial for her husband roused suspicions. It was known
that the government of Scotland was discussed at the French council-board, and whispers came
of a suggestion that the kingdom should be turned into an appanage for a younger son of the
French king. Meanwhile French money was sent to the Regent, a body of French troops served
as her bodyguard, and on the advance of the Lords in arms the French Court promised her the
support of a larger army.

[Sidenote: Scotland and Elizabeth.]

Against these schemes of the French Court the Scotch Lords saw no aid save in Elizabeth. Their
aim was to drive the Frenchmen out of Scotland; and this could only be done by help both in
money and men from England. Nor was the English Council slow to promise help. To Elizabeth
indeed the need of supporting rebels against their sovereign was a bitter one. The need of
establishing a Calvinistic Church on her frontier was yet bitterer. It was not a material force
which upheld the fabric of the monarchy, as it had been built up by the Houses of York and
of Tudor, but a moral force. England held that safety against anarchy within and against attacks
on the national independence from without was to be found in the Crown alone, and that obedience
to the Crown was the first element of national order and national greatness. In their religious
reforms the Tudor sovereigns had aimed at giving a religious sanction to the power which sprang
from this general conviction, and at hallowing their secular supremacy by blending with it
their supremacy over the Church. Against such a theory, either of Church or State, Calvinism
was an emphatic protest, and in aiding Calvinism to establish itself in Scotland the Queen
felt that she was dealing a heavy blow to her political and religious system at home. But,
struggle as she might against the necessity, she had no choice but to submit. The assumption
by Francis and Mary of the style of king and queen of England, the express reservation of this
claim, even in the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, made a French occupation of Scotland a matter
of life and death to the kingdom over the border. The English Council believed "that the French
mean, after their forces are brought into Scotland, first to conquer it,--which will be neither
hard nor long--and next that they and the Scots will invade this realm." They were soon pressed
to decide on their course. The Regent used her money to good purpose, and at the approach of
her forces the Lords withdrew from Edinburgh to the west. At the end of August two thousand
French soldiers landed at Leith, as the advance guard of the promised forces, and entrenched
themselves strongly. It was in vain that the Lords again appeared in the field, demanded the
withdrawal of the foreigners, and threatened Mary of Guise that as she would no longer hold
them for her counsellors "we also will no longer acknowledge you as our Regent." They were
ordered to disperse as traitors, beaten off from the fortifications of Leith, and attacked
by the French troops in Fife itself.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth's action.]

The Lords called loudly for aid from the English Queen. To give such assistance would have
seemed impossible but twelve months back. But the appeal of the Scots found a different England
from that which had met Elizabeth on her accession. The Queen's diplomacy had gained her a
year, and her matchless activity had used the year to good purpose. Order was restored throughout
England, the Church was reorganized, the debts of the Crown were in part paid off, the treasury
was recruited, a navy created, and a force made ready for action in the north. Neither religiously
nor politically indeed had Elizabeth any sympathy with the Scotch Lords. Knox was to her simply
a firebrand of rebellion; her political instinct shrank from the Scotch Calvinism with its
protest against the whole English system of government, whether in Church or State; and as
a Queen she hated revolt. But the danger forced her hand. Elizabeth was ready to act, and to
act even in the defiance of France. As yet she stood almost alone in her self-reliance. Spain
believed her ruin to be certain. Her challenge would bring war with France, and in a war with
France the Spanish statesmen held that only their master's intervention could save her. "For
our own sake," said one of Philip's ministers, "we must take as much care of England as of
the Low Countries." But that such a care would be needed Granvelle never doubted; and Philip's
councillors solemnly debated whether it might not be well to avoid the risk of a European struggle
by landing the six thousand men whom Philip was now withdrawing from the Netherlands on the
English shore, and coercing Elizabeth into quietness. France meanwhile despised her chances.
Her very Council was in despair. The one minister in whom she dared to confide throughout these
Scotch negotiations was Cecil, the youngest and boldest of her advisers, and even Cecil trembled
for her success. The Duke of Norfolk refused at first to take command of the force destined
as he held for a desperate enterprise. Arundel, the leading peer among the Catholics, denounced
the supporters of a Scottish war as traitors. But lies and hesitation were no sooner put aside
than the Queen's vigour and tenacity came fairly into play. In January 1560, at a moment when
D'Oysel, the French commander, was on the point of crushing the Lords of the Congregation,
an English fleet appeared suddenly in the Forth and forced the Regent's army to fall back upon
Leith.

[Sidenote: The Huguenot rising.]

Here however it again made an easy stand against the Protestant attacks, and at the close of
February the Queen was driven to make a formal treaty with the Lords by which she promised
to assist them in the expulsion of the strangers. The treaty was a bold defiance of the power
from whom Elizabeth had been glad to buy peace only a year before, even by the sacrifice of
Calais. But the Queen had little fear of a counter-blow from France. The Reformation was fighting
for her on the one side of the sea as on the other. From the outset of her reign the rapid
growth of the Huguenots in France had been threatening a strife between the old religion and
the new. It was to gird himself for such a struggle that Henry the Second concluded the treaty
of Cateau-Cambrésis; and though Henry's projects were foiled by his death, the Duke of Guise,
who ruled his successor, Francis the Second, pressed on yet more bitterly the work of persecution.
It was believed that he had sworn to exterminate "those of the religion." But the Huguenots
were in no mood to bear extermination. Their Protestantism, like that of the Scots, was the
Protestantism of Calvin. As they grew in numbers, their churches formed themselves on the model
of Geneva, and furnished in their synods and assemblies a political as well as a religious
organization; while the doctrine of resistance even to kings, if kings showed themselves enemies
to God, found ready hearers, whether among the turbulent French noblesse, or among the traders
of the towns who were stirred to new dreams of constitutional freedom. Theories of liberty
or of resistance to the crown were as abhorrent to Elizabeth as to the Guises, but again necessity
swept her into the current of Calvinism. She was forced to seize on the religious disaffection
of France as a check on the dreams of aggression which Francis and Mary had shown in assuming
the style of English Sovereigns. The English ambassador, Throckmorton, fed the alarms of the
Huguenots and pressed them to take up arms. It is probable that the Huguenot plot which broke
out in the March of 1560 in an attempt to surprise the French Court at Amboise was known beforehand
by Cecil; and, though the conspiracy was ruthlessly suppressed, the Queen drew fresh courage
from a sense that the Guises had henceforth work for their troops at home.

[Sidenote: Treaty of Edinburgh.]

At the end of March therefore Lord Grey pushed over the border with 8000 men to join the Lords
of the Congregation in the siege of Leith. The Scots gave little aid; and an assault on the
town signally failed. Philip too in a sudden jealousy of Elizabeth's growing strength demanded
the abandonment of the enterprise, and offered to warrant England against any attack from the
north if its forces were withdrawn. But eager as Elizabeth was to preserve Philip's alliance,
she preferred to be her own security. She knew that the Spanish king could not abandon her
while Mary Stuart was queen of France, and that at the moment of his remonstrances Philip was
menacing the Guises with war if they carried out their project of bringing about a Catholic
rising by a descent on the English coast. Nor were the threats of the French Court more formidable.
The bloody repression of the conspiracy of Amboise had only fired the temper of the Huguenots;
southern and western France were on the verge of revolt; the House of Bourbon had adopted the
reformed faith, and put itself at the head of the Protestant movement. In the face of dangers
such as these the Guises could send to Leith neither money nor men. Elizabeth therefore remained
immoveable while famine did its work on the town. At the crisis of the siege the death of Mary
of Guise threw the direct rule over Scotland into the hands of Francis and Mary Stuart; and
the exhaustion of the garrison forced the two sovereigns to purchase its liberation by two
treaties which their envoys concluded at Edinburgh in June 1560. That with the Scotch pledged
them to withdraw for ever the French from the realm, and left the government of Scotland to
a Council of the Lords. The treaty with England was a more difficult matter. Francis and Mary
had forbidden their envoys to sign any engagement with Elizabeth as to the Scottish realm,
or to consent to any abandonment of their claims on the royal style of England. It was only
after long debate that Cecil wrested from them the acknowledgement that the realms of England
and Ireland of right appertained to Elizabeth, and a vague clause by which the French sovereigns
promised the English Queen that they would fulfil their pledges to the Scots.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth's character.]

Stubborn however as was the resistance of the French envoys the signature of the treaty proclaimed
Elizabeth's success. The issue of the Scotch war revealed suddenly to Europe the vigour of
the Queen and the strength of her throne. What her ability really was no one, save Cecil, had
as yet suspected. There was little indeed in her outward demeanour to give any indication of
her greatness. To the world about her the temper of Elizabeth recalled in its strange contrasts
the mixed blood within her veins. She was at once a daughter of Henry and of Anne Boleyn. From
her father she inherited her frank and hearty address, her love of popularity and of free intercourse
with the people, her dauntless courage and her amazing self-confidence. Her harsh, manlike
voice, her impetuous will, her pride, her furious outbursts of anger came to her with her Tudor
blood. She rated great nobles as if they were schoolboys; she met the insolence of Lord Essex
with a box on the ear; she broke now and then into the gravest deliberations to swear at her
ministers like a fishwife. Strangely in contrast with these violent outlines of her father's
temper stood the sensuous, self-indulgent nature she drew from Anne Boleyn. Splendour and pleasure
were with Elizabeth the very air she breathed. Her delight was to move in perpetual progresses
from castle to castle through a series of gorgeous pageants, fanciful and extravagant as a
caliph's dream. She loved gaiety and laughter and wit. A happy retort or a finished compliment
never failed to win her favour. She hoarded jewels. Her dresses were innumerable. Her vanity
remained, even to old age, the vanity of a coquette in her teens. No adulation was too fulsome
for her, no flattery of her beauty too gross. She would play with her rings that her courtiers
might note the delicacy of her hands; or dance a coranto that an ambassador, hidden dexterously
behind a curtain, might report her sprightliness to his master. Her levity, her frivolous laughter,
her unwomanly jests gave colour to a thousand scandals. Her character in fact, like her portraits,
was utterly without shade. Of womanly reserve or self-restraint she knew nothing. No instinct
of delicacy veiled the voluptuous temper which broke out in the romps of her girlhood and showed
itself almost ostentatiously through her later life. Personal beauty in a man was a sure passport
to her liking. She patted handsome young squires on the neck when they knelt to kiss her hand,
and fondled her "sweet Robin," Lord Leicester, in the face of the Court.

It was no wonder that the statesmen whom she outwitted held Elizabeth to be little more than
a frivolous woman, or that Philip of Spain wondered how "a wanton" could hold in check the
policy of the Escurial. But the Elizabeth whom they saw was far from being all of Elizabeth.
Wilfulness and triviality played over the surface of a nature hard as steel, a temper purely
intellectual, the very type of reason untouched by imagination or passion. Luxurious and pleasure-loving
as she seemed, the young Queen lived simply and frugally, and she worked hard. Her vanity and
caprice had no weight whatever with her in state affairs. The coquette of the presence-chamber
became the coolest and hardest of politicians at the council-board. Fresh from the flattery
of her courtiers, she would tolerate no flattery in the closet; she was herself plain and downright
of speech with her counsellors, and she looked for a corresponding plainness of speech in return.
The very choice of her advisers indeed showed Elizabeth's ability. She had a quick eye for
merit of any sort, and a wonderful power of enlisting its whole energy in her service. The
sagacity which chose Cecil and Walsingham was just as unerring in its choice of the meanest
of her agents. Her success indeed in securing from the beginning of her reign to its end, with
the single exception of Leicester, precisely the right men for the work she set them to do
sprang in great measure from the noblest characteristic of her intellect. If in loftiness of
aim the Queen's temper fell below many of the tempers of her time, in the breadth of its range,
in the universality of its sympathy it stood far above them all. Elizabeth could talk poetry
with Spenser and philosophy with Bruno; she could discuss Euphuism with Lilly, and enjoy the
chivalry of Essex; she could turn from talk of the last fashions to pore with Cecil over despatches
and treasury books; she could pass from tracking traitors with Walsingham to settle points
of doctrine with Parker, or to calculate with Frobisher the chances of a north-west passage
to the Indies. The versatility and many-sidedness of her mind enabled her to understand every
phase of the intellectual movement about her, and to fix by a sort of instinct on its higher
representatives.

It was only on its intellectual side indeed that Elizabeth touched the England of her day.
All its moral aspects were simply dead to her. It was a time when men were being lifted into
nobleness by the new moral energy which seemed suddenly to pulse through the whole people,
when honour and enthusiasm took colours of poetic beauty, and religion became a chivalry. But
the finer sentiments of the men about her touched Elizabeth simply as the fair tints of a picture
would have touched her. She made her market with equal indifference out of the heroism of William
of Orange or the bigotry of Philip. The noblest aims and lives were only counters on her board.
She was the one soul in her realm whom the news of St. Bartholomew stirred to no thirst for
vengeance; and while England was thrilling with the triumph over the Armada, its Queen was
coolly grumbling over the cost, and making her profit out of the spoiled provisions she had
ordered for the fleet that saved her. No womanly sympathy bound her even to those who stood
closest to her life. She loved Leicester indeed; she was grateful to Cecil. But for the most
part she was deaf to the voices either of love or gratitude. She accepted such services as
were never rendered to any other English sovereign without a thought of return. Walsingham
spent his fortune in saving her life and her throne, and she left him to die a beggar. But,
as if by a strange irony, it was to this very lack of womanly sympathy that she owed some of
the grandest features of her character. If she was without love she was without hate. She cherished
no petty resentments; she never stooped to envy or suspicion of the men who served her. She
was indifferent to abuse. Her good humour was never ruffled by the charges of wantonness and
cruelty with which the Jesuits filled every Court in Europe. She was insensible to fear. Her
life became at last a mark for assassin after assassin, but the thought of peril was the thought
hardest to bring home to her. Even when Catholic plots broke out in her very household she
would listen to no proposals for the removal of Catholics from her court.

If any trace of her sex lingered in the Queen's actual statesmanship, it was seen in the simplicity
and tenacity of purpose that often underlies a woman's fluctuations of feeling. It was the
directness and steadiness of her aims which gave her her marked superiority over the statesmen
of her time. No nobler group of ministers ever gathered round a council-board than those who
gathered round the council-board of Elizabeth. But she was the instrument of none. She listened,
she weighed, she used or put by the counsels of each in turn, but her policy as a whole was
her own. It was a policy, not of genius, but of good sense. Her aims were simple and obvious:
to preserve her throne, to keep England out of war, to restore civil and religious order. Something
of womanly caution and timidity perhaps backed the passionless indifference with which she
set aside the larger schemes of ambition which were ever opening before her eyes. In later
days she was resolute in her refusal of the Low Countries. She rejected with a laugh the offers
of the Protestants to make her "head of the religion" and "mistress of the seas." But her amazing
success in the end sprang mainly from this wise limitation of her aims. She had a finer sense
than any of her counsellors of her real resources; she knew instinctively how far she could
go and what she could do. Her cold, critical intellect was never swayed by enthusiasm or by
panic either to exaggerate or to underestimate her risks or her power. Of political wisdom
indeed in its larger and more generous sense Elizabeth had little or none; but her political
tact was unerring. She seldom saw her course at a glance, but she played with a hundred courses,
fitfully and discursively, as a musician runs his fingers over the keyboard, till she hit suddenly
upon the right one. Her nature was essentially practical and of the present. She distrusted
a plan in fact just in proportion to its speculative range or its outlook into the future.
Her notion of statesmanship lay in watching how things turned out around her, and in seizing
the moment for making the best of them.

Such a policy as this, limited, practical, tentative as it always was, had little of grandeur
and originality about it; it was apt indeed to degenerate into mere trickery and finesse. But
it was a policy suited to the England of her day, to its small resources and the transitional
character of its religious and political belief, and it was eminently suited to Elizabeth's
peculiar powers. It was a policy of detail, and in details her wonderful readiness and ingenuity
found scope for their exercise. "No War, my Lords," the Queen used to cry imperiously at the
council-board, "No War!" but her hatred of war sprang not so much from aversion to blood or
to expense, real as was her aversion to both, as from the fact that peace left the field open
to the diplomatic manoeuvres and intrigues in which she excelled. Her delight in the consciousness
of her ingenuity broke out in a thousand puckish freaks, freaks in which one can hardly see
any purpose beyond the purpose of sheer mystification. She revelled in "bye-ways" and "crooked
ways." She played with grave cabinets as a cat plays with a mouse, and with much of the same
feline delight in the mere embarrassment of her victims. When she was weary of mystifying foreign
statesmen she turned to find fresh sport in mystifying her own ministers. Had Elizabeth written
the story of her reign she would have prided herself, not on the triumph of England or the
ruin of Spain, but on the skill with which she had hoodwinked and outwitted every statesman
in Europe during fifty years. A falsehood was to her simply an intellectual means of meeting
a difficulty; and the ease with which she asserted or denied whatever suited her purpose was
only equalled by the cynical indifference with which she met the exposure of her lies as soon
as their purpose was answered. Her trickery in fact had its political value. Ignoble and wearisome
as the Queen's diplomacy seems to us now, tracking it as we do through a thousand despatches,
it succeeded in its main end, for it gained time, and every year that was gained doubled Elizabeth's
strength. She made as dexterous a use of the foibles of her temper. Her levity carried her
gaily over moments of detection and embarrassment where better women would have died of shame.
She screened her tentative and hesitating statesmanship under the natural timidity and vacillation
of her sex. She turned her very luxury and sports to good account. There were moments of grave
danger in her reign when the country remained indifferent to its perils, as it saw the Queen
give her days to hawking and hunting, and her nights to dancing and plays. Her vanity and affectation,
her womanly fickleness and caprice, all had their part in the diplomatic comedies she played
with the successive candidates for her hand. If political necessities made her life a lonely
one, she had at any rate the satisfaction of averting war and conspiracies by love sonnets
and romantic interviews, or of gaining a year of tranquillity by the dexterous spinning out
of a flirtation.

As we track Elizabeth through her tortuous mazes of lying and intrigue, the sense of her greatness
is almost lost in a sense of contempt. But, wrapped as they were in a cloud of mystery, the
aims of her policy were throughout temperate and simple, and they were pursued with a rare
tenacity. The sudden acts of energy which from time to time broke her habitual hesitation proved
that it was no hesitation of weakness. Elizabeth could wait and finesse; but when the hour
was come she could strike, and strike hard. Her natural temper indeed tended to a rash self-confidence
rather than to self-distrust. "I have the heart of a King," she cried at a moment of utter
peril, and it was with a kingly unconsciousness of the dangers about her that she fronted them
for fifty years. She had, as strong natures always have, an unbounded confidence in her luck.
"Her Majesty counts much on Fortune," Walsingham wrote bitterly; "I wish she would trust more
in Almighty God." The diplomatists who censured at one moment her irresolution, her delay,
her changes of front, censure at the next her "obstinacy," her iron will, her defiance of what
seemed to them inevitable ruin. "This woman," Philip's envoy wrote after a wasted remonstrance,
"this woman is possessed by a hundred thousand devils." To her own subjects, who knew nothing
of her manoeuvres and flirtations, of her "bye-ways" and "crooked ways," she seemed the embodiment
of dauntless resolution. Brave as they were, the men who swept the Spanish Main or glided between
the icebergs of Baffin's Bay never doubted that the palm of bravery lay with their Queen.

[Sidenote: Catharine of Medicis.]

It was this dauntless courage which backed Elizabeth's good luck in the Scottish war. The issue
of the war wholly changed her position at home and abroad. Not only had she liberated herself
from the control of Philip and successfully defied the threats of the Guises, but at a single
blow she had freed England from what had been its sorest danger for two hundred years. She
had broken the dependence of Scotland upon France. That perpetual peace between England and
the Scots which the policy of the Tudors had steadily aimed at was at last sworn in the Treaty
of Edinburgh. If the Queen had not bound to her all Scotland, she had bound to her the strongest
and most vigorous party among the nobles of the north. The Lords of the Congregation promised
to be obedient to Elizabeth in all such matters as might not lead to the overthrow of their
country's rights or of Scottish liberties. They were bound to her not only by the war but by
the events that followed the war. A Parliament at Edinburgh accepted the Calvinistic confession
of Geneva as the religion of Scotland, abolished the temporal jurisdiction of the bishops,
and prohibited the celebration of the Mass. The Act and the Treaty were alike presented for
confirmation to Francis and Mary. They were roughly put aside, for the French king would give
no sanction to a successful revolt, and Mary had no mind to waive her claim to the English
throne. But from action the two sovereigns were held back by the troubles in France. It was
in vain that the Guises strove to restore political and religious unity by an assembly of the
French notables: the notables met only to receive a demand for freedom of worship from the
Huguenots of the west, and to force the Government to promise a national council for the settlement
of the religious disputes as well as a gathering of the States-General. The counsellors of
Francis resolved to anticipate this meeting by a sudden stroke at the heretics; and as a preliminary
step the chiefs of the House of Bourbon were seized at the court and the Prince of Condé threatened
with death. The success of this measure roused anew the wrath of the young king at the demands
of the Scots, and at the close of 1560 Francis was again nursing plans of vengeance on the
Lords of the Congregation. But Elizabeth's good fortune still proved true to her. The projects
of the Guises were suddenly foiled by the young king's death. The power of Mary Stuart and
her kindred came to an end, for the childhood of Charles the Ninth gave the regency over France
to the queen-mother, Catharine of Medicis, and the policy of Catharine secured England and
Scotland alike from danger of attack. Her temper, like that of Elizabeth, was a purely political
temper; her aim was to balance Catholics against Protestants to the profit of the throne. She
needed peace abroad to preserve this political and religious balance at home, and though she
made some fruitless efforts to renew the old friendship with Scotland, she had no mind to intrigue
like the Guises with the English Catholics nor to back Mary Stuart's pretensions to the English
throne.

[Sidenote: Philip's policy.]

With Scotland as an ally and with France at peace Elizabeth's throne at last seemed secure.
The outbreak of the strife between the Old Faith and the New indeed, if it gave the Queen safety
abroad, somewhat weakened her at home. The sense of a religious change which her caution had
done so much to disguise broke slowly on England as it saw the Queen allying herself with Scotch
Calvinists and French Huguenots; and the compromise she had hoped to establish in matters of
worship became hourly less possible as the more earnest Catholics discerned the Protestant
drift of Elizabeth's policy. But Philip still held them back from any open resistance. There
was much indeed to move him from his old support of the Queen. The widowhood of Mary Stuart
freed him from his dread of a permanent annexation of Scotland by France as well as of a French
annexation of England, while the need of holding England as a check on French hostility to
the House of Austria grew weaker as the outbreak of civil war between the Guises and their
opponents rendered French hostility less possible. Elizabeth's support of the Huguenots drove
the Spanish king to a burst of passion. A Protestant France not only outraged his religious
bigotry, but, as he justly feared, it would give an impulse to heresy throughout his possessions
in the Netherlands which would make it hard to keep his hold upon them. Philip noted that the
success of the Scotch Calvinists had been followed by the revolt of the Calvinists in France.
He could hardly doubt that the success of the French Huguenots would be followed by a rising
of the Calvinists in the Low Countries. "Religion" he told Elizabeth angrily "was being made
a cloak for anarchy and revolution." But, vexed as Philip was with her course both abroad and
at home, he was still far from withdrawing his support from Elizabeth. Even now he could not
look upon the Queen as lost to Catholicism. He knew how her course both at home and abroad
had been forced on her not by religious enthusiasm but by political necessity, and he still
"trusted that ere long God would give us either a general council or a good Pope who would
correct abuses and then all would go well. That God would allow so noble and Christian a realm
as England to break away from Christendom and run the risk of perdition he could not believe."

[Sidenote: Pius the Fourth.]

What was needed, Philip thought, was a change of policy in the Papacy. The bigotry of Paul
the Fourth had driven England from the obedience of the Roman See. The gentler policy of Pius
the Fourth might yet restore her to it. Pius was as averse from any break with Elizabeth as
Philip was. He censured bitterly the harshness of his predecessor. The loss of Scotland and
the threatened loss of France he laid to the charge of the wars which Paul had stirred up against
Philip and which had opened a way for the spread of Calvinism in both kingdoms. England, he
held, could have been easily preserved for Catholicism but for Paul's rejection of the conciliatory
efforts of Pole. When he ascended the Papal throne at the end of 1559 indeed the accession
of England to the Reformation seemed complete. The royal supremacy was re-established: the
Mass abolished: the English Liturgy restored. A new episcopate, drawn from the Calvinistic
refugees, was being gathered round Matthew Parker. But Pius would not despair. He saw no reason
why England should not again be Catholic. He knew that the bulk of its people clung to the
older religion, if they clung also to independence of the Papal jurisdiction and to the secularization
of the Abbey-lands. The Queen, as he believed, had been ready for a compromise at her accession,
and he was ready to make terms with her now. In the spring of 1560 therefore he despatched
Parpaglia, a follower of Pole, to open negotiations with Elizabeth. The moment which the Pope
had chosen was a critical one for the Queen. She was in the midst of the Scotch war, and her
forces had just been repulsed in an attempt to storm the walls of Leith. Such a repulse woke
fears of conspiracy among the Catholic nobles of the northern border, and a refusal to receive
the legate would have driven them to an open rising. On the other hand the reception of Parpaglia
would have alienated the Protestants, shaken the trust of the Lords of the Congregation in
the Queen's support, and driven them to make terms with Francis and Mary. In either case Scotland
fell again under the rule of France, and the throne of Elizabeth was placed in greater peril
than ever. So great was the Queen's embarrassment that she availed herself of Cecil's absence
in the north to hold out hopes of the legate's admission to the realm and her own reconciliation
with the Papacy. But she was freed from these difficulties by the resolute intervention of
Philip. If he disapproved of her policy in Scotland he had no mind that Scotland should become
wholly French or Elizabeth be really shaken on her throne. He ordered the legate therefore
to be detained in Flanders till his threats had obtained from the Pope an order for his recall.

[Sidenote: The Council of Trent.]

But Pius was far from abandoning his hopes. After ten years suspension he had again summoned
the Council of Trent. The cry for Church reform, the threat of national synods in Spain and
in France, forced this measure on the Pope; and Pius availed himself of the assembly of the
Council to make a fresh attempt to turn the tide of the Reformation and to win back the Protestant
Churches to Catholicism. He called therefore on the Lutheran princes of Germany to send doctors
to the Council, and in May 1561, eight months after Parpaglia's failure, despatched a fresh
nuncio, Martinengo, to invite Elizabeth to send ambassadors to Trent. Philip pressed for the
nuncio's admission to the realm. His hopes of the Queen's return to the faith were now being
fed by a new marriage-negotiation; for on the withdrawal of the Archduke of Austria in sheer
weariness of Elizabeth's treachery, she had encouraged her old playfellow, Lord Robert Dudley,
to hope for her hand and to amuse Philip by pledges of bringing back "the religion," should
the help of the Spanish king enable him to win it. Philip gave his help, but Dudley remained
a suitor, and the hopes of a Catholic revolution became fainter than ever. The Queen would
suffer no landing of a legate in her realm. The invitation to the Council fared no better.
The Lutheran states of North Germany had already refused to attend. The Council, they held,
was no longer a council of reunion. In its earlier session it had formally condemned the very
doctrine on which Protestantism was based; and to join it now would simply be to undo all that
Luther had done. Elizabeth showed as little hesitation. The hour of her triumph, when a Calvinistic
Scotland and a Calvinistic France proved the mainstays of her policy, was no hour of submission
to the Papacy. In spite of Philip's entreaties she refused to send envoys to what was not "a
free Christian Council." The refusal was decisive in marking Elizabeth's position. The long
period of hesitation, of drift, was over. All chance of submission to the Papacy was at an
end. In joining the Lutheran states in their rejection of this Council, England had definitely
ranged itself on the side of the Reformation.

CHAPTER IV

ENGLAND AND MARY STUART

1561-1567

[Sidenote: The English Catholics.]

What had hitherto kept the bulk of Elizabeth's subjects from opposition to her religious system
was a disbelief in its permanence. Englishmen had seen English religion changed too often to
believe that it would change no more. When the Commissioners forced a Protestant ritual on
St. John's College at Oxford, its founder, Sir Thomas White, simply took away its vestments
and crucifixes, and hid them in his house for the better times that every zealous Catholic
trusted would have their turn. They believed that a Catholic marriage would at once bring such
a turn about; and if Elizabeth dismissed the offer of Philip's hand she played long and assiduously
with that of a son of the Emperor, an archduke of the same Austrian house. But the alliance
with the Scotch heretics proved a rough blow to this trust: and after the repulse at Leith
there were whispers that the two great Catholic nobles of the border, the Earls of Northumberland
and Westmoreland, were only waiting for the failure of the Scotch enterprise to rise on behalf
of the older faith. Whatever their projects were, they were crushed by the Queen's success.
With the Lords of the Congregation masters across the border the northern Earls lay helpless
between the two Protestant realms. In the mass of men loyalty was still too strong for any
dream of revolt; but there was a growing uneasiness lest they should find themselves heretics
after all, which the failure of the Austrian match and the help given to the Huguenots was
fanning into active discontent. It was this which gave such weight to the Queen's rejection
of the summons to Trent. Whatever colour she might strive to put upon it, the bulk of her subjects
accepted the refusal as a final break with Catholicism, as a final close to all hope of their
reunion with the Catholic Church.

[Sidenote: Mary Stuart.]

The Catholic disaffection which the Queen was henceforth to regard as her greatest danger was
thus growing into life when in August 1561, but a few months after the Queen's refusal to acknowledge
the Council, Mary Stuart landed at Leith. Girl as she was, and she was only nineteen, Mary
was hardly inferior in intellectual power to Elizabeth herself, while in fire and grace and
brilliancy of temper she stood high above her. She brought with her the voluptuous refinement
of the French Renascence; she would lounge for days in bed, and rise only at night for dances
and music. But her frame was of iron, and incapable of fatigue; she galloped ninety miles after
her last defeat without a pause save to change horses. She loved risk and adventure and the
ring of arms; as she rode in a foray to the north the swordsmen beside her heard her wish she
was a man "to know what life it was to lie all night in the fields, or to walk on the cawsey
with a jack and knapschalle, a Glasgow buckler and a broadsword." Be accepted thus, became, and

 It was
the fight, not of French factions, but of Protestantism and Catholicism, that was to be fought
out on the fields of France. The two warring elements of Protestantism were represented in
the Huguenot camp where German Lutherans stood side by side with the French Calvinists. On
the other hand the French Catholics were backed by soldiers from the Catholic cantons of Switzerland,
from the Catholic states of Germany, from Catholic Italy, and from Catholic Spain. The encounter
was a desperate one, but it ended in a virtual triumph for the Guises. While the German troops
of Coligni clung to the Norman coast in the hope of subsidies from Elizabeth, the Duke of Guise
was able to march at the opening of 1563 on the Loire, and form the siege of Orleans.

[Sidenote: Mary and Protestantism.]

In Scotland Mary Stuart was watching her uncle's progress with ever-growing hope. The policy
of Murray had failed in the end to which she mainly looked. Her acceptance of the new religion,
her submission to the Lords of the Congregation, had secured her a welcome in Scotland and
gathered the Scotch people round her standard. But it had done nothing for her on the other
side of the border. Two years had gone by, and any recognition of her right of succession to
the English crown seemed as far off as ever. But Murray's policy was far from being Mary's
only resource. She had never surrendered herself in more than outer show to her brother's schemes.
In heart she had never ceased to be a bigoted Catholic, resolute for the suppression of Protestantism
as soon as her toleration of it had given her strength enough for the work. It was this that
made the strife between the two Queens of such terrible moment for English freedom. Elizabeth
was fighting for more than personal ends. She was fighting for more than her own occupation
of the English throne. Consciously or unconsciously she was struggling to avert from England
the rule of a Queen who would have undone the whole religious work of the past half-century,
who would have swept England back into the tide of Catholicism, and who in doing this would
have blighted and crippled its national energies at the very moment of their mightiest developement.
It was the presence of such a danger that sharpened the eyes of Protestants on both sides the
border. However she might tolerate the reformed religion or hold out hopes of her compliance
with a reformed worship, no earnest Protestant either in England or in Scotland could bring
himself to see other than an enemy in the Scottish Queen. Within a few months of her arrival
the cool eye of Knox had pierced through the veil of Mary's dissimulation. "The Queen," he
wrote to Cecil, "neither is nor shall be of our opinion." Her steady refusal to ratify the
Treaty of Edinburgh or to confirm the statutes on which the Protestantism of Scotland rested
was of far greater significance than her support of Murray or her honeyed messages to Elizabeth.
While the young Queen looked coolly on at the ruin of the Catholic house of Huntly, at the
persecution of Catholic recusants, at so strict an enforcement of the new worship that "none
within the realm durst more avow the hearing or saying of Mass than the thieves of Liddesdale
durst avow their stealth in presence of an upright judge," she was in secret correspondence
with the Guises and the Pope. Her eye was fixed upon France. While Catharine of Medicis was
all-powerful, while her edict secured toleration for the Huguenots on one side of the sea,
Mary knew that it was impossible to refuse toleration on the other. But with the first movement
of the Duke of Guise fiercer hopes revived. Knox was "assured that the Queen danced till after
midnight because that she had received letters that persecution was begun in France, and that
her uncles were beginning to stir their tail, and to trouble the whole realm of France." Whether
she gave such open proof of her joy or no, Mary woke to a new energy at the news of Guise's
success. She wrote to Pope Pius to express her regret that the heresy of her realm prevented
her sending envoys to the Council of Trent. She assured the Cardinal of Lorraine that she would
restore Catholicism in her dominions, even at the peril of her life. She pressed on Philip
of Spain a proposal for her marriage with his son, Don Carlos, as a match which would make
her strong enough to restore Scotland to the Church.

[Sidenote: The Papal Brief.]

The echo of the French conflict was felt in England as in the north. The English Protestants
saw in it the approach of a struggle for life and death at home. The English Queen saw in it
a danger to her throne. So great was Elizabeth's terror at the victory of Dreux that she resolved
to open her purse-strings and to hire fresh troops for the Huguenots in Germany. But her dangers
grew at home as abroad. The victory of Guise dealt the first heavy blow at her system of religious
conformity. Rome had abandoned its dreams of conciliation on her refusal to own the Council
of Trent, and though Philip's entreaties brought Pius to suspend the issue of a Bull of Deposition,
the Papacy opened the struggle by issuing in August 1562 a brief which pronounced joining in
the Common Prayer schismatic and forbade the attendance of Catholics at church. On no point
was Elizabeth so sensitive, for on no point had her policy seemed so successful. Till now,
whatever might be their fidelity to the older faith, few Englishmen had carried their opposition
to the Queen's changes so far as to withdraw from religious communion with those who submitted
to them. But with the issue of the brief this unbroken conformity came to an end. A few of
the hotter Catholics withdrew from church. Heavy fines were laid on them as recusants; fines
which, as their numbers increased, became a valuable source of supply for the royal exchequer.
But no fines could compensate for the moral blow which their withdrawal dealt. It was the beginning
of a struggle which Elizabeth had averted through three memorable years. Protestant fanaticism
met Catholic fanaticism, and as news of the massacre at Vassy spread through England the Protestant
preachers called for the death of "Papists." The tidings of Dreux spread panic through the
realm. The Parliament which met again in January 1563 showed its terror by measures of a new
severity. There had been enough of words, cried one of the Queen's ministers, Sir Francis Knollys,
"it was time to draw the sword."

[Sidenote: The Test Act.]

The sword was drawn in the first of a series of penal statutes which weighed upon English Catholics
for two hundred years. By this statute an oath of allegiance to the Queen and of abjuration
of the temporal authority of the Pope was exacted from all holders of office, lay or spiritual,
within the realm, with the exception of peers. Its effect was to place the whole power of the
realm in the hands either of Protestants or of Catholics who accepted Elizabeth's legitimacy
and her ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the teeth of the Papacy. The oath of supremacy was already
exacted from every clergyman and every member of the universities. But the obligation of taking
it was now widely extended. Every member of the House of Commons, every officer in the army
or the fleet, every schoolmaster and private tutor, every justice of the peace, every municipal
magistrate, to whom the oath was tendered, was pledged from this moment to resist the blows
which Rome was threatening to deal. Extreme caution indeed was used in applying this test to
the laity, but pressure was more roughly put on the clergy. A great part of the parish priests,
though they had submitted to the use of the Prayer-Book, had absented themselves when called
on to take the oath prescribed by the Act of Uniformity, and were known to be Catholics in
heart. As yet Elizabeth had cautiously refused to allow any strict enquiry into their opinions.
But a commission was now opened by her order at Lambeth, to enforce the Act of Uniformity in
public worship; while thirty-nine of the Articles of Faith drawn up under Edward the Sixth,
which had till now been left in suspense by her Government, were adopted in Convocation as
a standard of faith, and acceptance of them demanded from all the clergy.

[Sidenote: Mary and Knox.]

With the Test Act and the establishment of the High Commission the system which the Queen had
till now pursued in great measure ceased. Elizabeth had "drawn the sword." It is possible she
might still have clung to her older policy had she foreseen how suddenly the danger which appalled
her was to pass away. At this crisis, as ever, she was able to "count on Fortune." The Test
Act was hardly passed when in February 1563 the Duke of Guise was assassinated by a Protestant
zealot, and with his murder the whole face of affairs was changed. The Catholic army was paralyzed
by its leader's loss, while Coligni, who was now strengthened with money and forces from England,
became master of Normandy. The war however came quietly to an end; for Catharine of Medicis
regained her power on the Duke's death, and her aim was still an aim of peace. A treaty with
the Huguenots was concluded in March, and a new edict of Amboise restored the truce of religion.
Elizabeth's luck indeed was chequered by a merited humiliation. Now that peace was restored
Huguenot and Catholic united to demand the surrender of Havre; and an outbreak of plague among
its garrison compelled the town to capitulate. The new strife in which England thus found itself
involved with the whole realm of France moved fresh hopes in Mary Stuart. Mary had anxiously
watched her uncle's progress, for his success would have given her the aid of a Catholic France
in her projects on either side of the border. But even his defeat failed utterly to dishearten
her. The war between the two Queens which followed it might well force Catharine of Medicis
to seek Scottish aid against England, and the Scottish Queen would thus have secured that alliance
with a great power which the English Catholics demanded before they would rise at her call.
At home troubles were gathering fast around her. Veil her hopes as she might, the anxiety with
which she had followed the struggle of her kindred had not been lost on the Protestant leaders,
and it is probable that Knox at any rate had learned something of her secret correspondence
with the Pope and the Guises. The Scotch Calvinists were stirred by the peril of their brethren
in France, and the zeal of the preachers was roused by a revival of the old worship in Clydesdale
and by the neglect of the Government to suppress it. In the opening of 1563 they resolved "to
put to their own hands," and without further plaint to Queen or Council to carry out "the punishment
that God had appointed to idolaters in his law." In Mary's eyes such a resolve was rebellion.
But her remonstrances only drew a more formal doctrine of resistance from Knox. "The sword
of justice, madam, is God's," said the stern preacher, "and is given to princes and rulers
for an end; which, if they transgress, they that in the fear of God execute judgements when
God has commanded offend not God. Neither yet sin they that bridle kings who strike innocent
men in their rage." The Queen was forced to look on while nearly fifty Catholics, some of them
high ecclesiastics, were indicted and sent to prison for celebrating mass in Paisley and Ayrshire.

[Sidenote: Peace with France.]

The zeal of the preachers was only heightened by the coolness of the Lords. A Scotch Parliament
which assembled in the summer of 1563 contented itself with securing the spoilers in their
possession of the Church lands, but left the Acts passed in 1560 for the establishment of Protestantism
unconfirmed as before. Such a silence Knox regarded as treason to the faith. He ceased to have
any further intercourse with Murray, and addressed a burning appeal to the Lords, "Will ye
betray God's cause when ye have it in your hands to establish it as ye please? The Queen, ye
say, will not agree with you. Ask ye of her that which by God's word ye may justly require,
and if she will not agree with ye in God, ye are not bound to agree with her in the devil!"
The inaction of the nobles proved the strength which Mary drew from the attitude of France.
So long as France and England were at war, so long as a French force might at any moment be
despatched to Mary's aid, it was impossible for them to put pressure on the Queen; and bold
as was the action of the preachers the Queen only waited her opportunity for dealing them a
fatal blow. But whatever hopes Mary may have founded on the strife, they were soon brought
to an end. Catharine used her triumph only to carry out her system of balance, and to resist
the joint remonstrance of the Pope, the Emperor, and the King of Spain against her edict of
toleration. The policy of Elizabeth, on the other hand, was too much identified with Catharine's
success to leave room for further hostilities; and a treaty of peace between the two countries
was concluded in the spring of 1564.

[Sidenote: Darnley.]

The peace with France marked a crisis in the struggle between the rival Queens. It left Elizabeth
secure against a Catholic rising and free to meet the pressure from the north. But it dashed
the last hopes of Mary Stuart to the ground. The policy which she had pursued from her landing
in Scotland had proved a failure in the end at which it aimed. Her religious toleration, her
patience, her fair speeches, had failed to win from Elizabeth a promise of the succession.
And meanwhile the Calvinism she hated was growing bolder and bolder about her. The strife of
religion in France had woke a fiercer bigotry in the Scotch preachers. Knox had discovered
her plans of reaction, had publicly denounced her designs of a Catholic marriage, and had met
her angry tears, her threats of vengeance, with a cool defiance. All that Murray's policy seemed
to have really done was to estrange from her the English Catholics. Already alienated from
Mary by her connexion with France, which they still regarded as a half-heretic power, and by
the hostility of Philip, in whom they trusted as a pure Catholic, the adherents of the older
faith could hardly believe in the Queen's fidelity to their religion when they saw her abandoning
Scotland to heresy and holding out hopes of her acceptance of the Anglican creed. Her presence
had roused them to a new energy, and they were drifting more and more as the strife waxed warmer
abroad to dreams of forcing on Elizabeth a Catholic successor. But as yet their hopes turned
not so much to Mary Stuart as to the youth who stood next to the Scottish Queen in the line
of blood. Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was a son of the Countess of Lennox, Margaret Douglas,
a daughter of Margaret Tudor by her second marriage with the Earl of Angus. Lady Lennox was
the successor whom Mary Tudor would willingly have chosen in her sister's stead, had Philip
and the Parliament suffered her; and from the moment of Elizabeth's accession the Countess
had schemed to drive her from the throne. She offered Philip to fly with her boy to the Low
Countries and to serve as a pretender in his hands. She intrigued with the partizans of the
old religion. Though the house of Lennox conformed to the new system of English worship, its
sympathies were known to be Catholic, and the hopes of the Catholics wrapped themselves round
its heir. "Should any disaster befall the Queen," wrote a Spanish ambassador in 1560, "the
Catholics would choose Lord Darnley for King." "Not only," he adds in a later letter, "would
all sides agree to choose him were the Queen to die, but the Catholic Lords, if opportunity
offer, may declare for him at once."

[Sidenote: Mary and Darnley.]

His strongest rival was Mary Stuart, and before Mary landed in Scotland Lady Lennox planned
the union of both their claims by the marriage of her son with the Scottish Queen. A few days
after her landing Mary received a formal offer of his hand. Hopes of yet greater matches, of
a marriage with Philip's son, Don Carlos, or with the young French king, Charles the Ninth,
had long held the scheme at bay; but as these and her policy of conciliation proved alike fruitless
Mary turned to the Lennoxes. The marriage was probably planned by David Rizzio, a young Piedmontese
who had won the Scotch Queen's favour, and through whom she conducted the intrigues, both in
England and abroad, by which she purposed to free herself from Murray's power and to threaten
Elizabeth. Her diplomacy was winning Philip to her cause. The Spanish king had as yet looked
upon Mary's system of toleration and on her hopes from France with equal suspicion. But he
now drew slowly to her side. Pressed hard in the Mediterranean by the Turks, he was harassed
more than ever by the growing discontent of the Netherlands, where the triumph of Protestantism
in England and Scotland and the power of the Huguenots in France gave fresh vigour to the growth
of Calvinism, and where the nobles were stirred to new outbreaks against the foreign rule of
Spain by the success of the Scottish Lords in their rising and by the terms of semi-independence
which the French nobles wrested from the Queen. It was to hold the Netherlands in check that
Philip longed for Mary's success. Her triumph over Murray and his confederates would vindicate
the cause of monarchy; her triumph over Calvinism would vindicate that of Catholicism both
in her own realm and in the realm which she hoped to win. He sent her therefore assurances
of his support, and assurances as strong reached her from the Vatican. The dispensation which
was secretly obtained for her marriage with Darnley was granted on the pledge of both to do
their utmost for the restoration of the old religion.

[Sidenote: The Darnley Marriage.]

Secret as was the pledge, the mere whisper of the match revealed their danger to the Scotch
Protestants. The Lords of the Congregation woke with a start from their confidence in the Queen.
Murray saw that the policy to which he had held his sister since her arrival in the realm was
now to be abandoned. Mary was no longer to be the Catholic ruler of a Protestant country, seeking
peaceful acknowledgement of her right of succession to Elizabeth's throne; she had placed herself
at the head of the English Catholics, and such a position at once threatened the safety of
Protestantism in Scotland itself. If once Elizabeth were overthrown by a Catholic rising, and
a Catholic policy established in England, Scotch Protestantism was at an end. At the first
rumour of the match therefore Murray drew Argyle and the Hamiltons round him in a band of self-defence,
and refused his signature to a paper recommending Darnley as husband to the Queen. But Mary's
diplomacy detached from him lord after lord, till his only hope lay in the opposition of Elizabeth.
The marriage with Darnley was undoubtedly a danger even more formidable to England than to
Scotland. It put an end to the dissensions which had till now broken the strength of the English
Catholics. It rallied them round Mary and Darnley as successors to the throne. It gathered
to their cause the far greater mass of cautious conservatives who had been detached from Mary
by her foreign blood and by dread of her kinship with the Guises. Darnley was reckoned an Englishman,
and with an English husband to sway her policy Mary herself seemed to become an Englishwoman.
But it was in vain that the Council pronounced the marriage a danger to the realm, that Elizabeth
threatened Mary with war, or that she plotted with Murray for the seizure of Mary and the driving
Darnley back over the border. Threat and plot were too late to avert the union, and at the
close of July 1565, Darnley was married to Mary Stuart and proclaimed king of Scotland. Murray
at once called the Lords of the Congregation to arms. But the most powerful and active stood
aloof. As heir of the line of Angus, Darnley was by blood the head of the house of Douglas,
and, Protestants as they were, the Douglases rallied to their kinsman. Their actual chieftain,
the Earl of Morton, stood next to Murray himself in his power over the Congregation; he was
chancellor of the realm; and his strength as a great noble was backed by a dark and unscrupulous
ability. By waiving their claim to the earldom of Angus and the lands which he held, the Lennoxes
won Morton to his kinsman's cause, and the Earl was followed in his course by two of the sternest
and most active among the Protestant Lords, Darnley's uncle, Lord Ruthven, and Lord Lindesay,
who had married a Douglas. Their desertion broke Murray's strength; and his rising was hardly
declared when Mary marched on his little force with pistols in her belt, and drove its leaders
over the border.

[Sidenote: Mary and Catholicism.]

The work which Elizabeth had done in Scotland had been undone in an hour. Murray was a fugitive.
The Lords of the Congregation were broken or dispersed. The English party was ruined. And while
Scotland was lost it seemed as if the triumph of Mary was a signal for the general revival
of Catholicism. The influence of the Guises had again become strong in France, and though Catharine
of Medicis held firmly to her policy of toleration, an interview which she held with Alva at
Bayonne led every Protestant to believe in the conclusion of a league between France and Spain
for a common war on Protestantism. To this league the English statesmen held that Mary Stuart
had become a party, and her pressure upon Elizabeth was backed by the suspicion that the two
great monarchies had pledged her their support. No such league existed, nor had such a pledge
been given, but the dread served Mary's purpose as well as the reality could have done. Girt
in, as she believed, with foes, Elizabeth took refuge in the meanest dissimulation, while Mary
Stuart imperiously demanded a recognition of her succession as the price of peace. But her
aims went far beyond this demand. She found herself greeted at Rome as the champion of the
Faith. Pius the Fifth, who mounted the Papal throne at the moment of her success, seized on
the young Queen to strike the first blow in the crusade against Protestantism on which he was
set. He promised her troops and money. He would support her, he said, so long as he had a single
chalice to sell. "With the help of God and your Holiness," Mary wrote back, "I will leap over
the wall." In England itself the marriage and her new attitude rallied every Catholic to Mary's
standard; and the announcement of her pregnancy which followed gave her a strength that swept
aside Philip's counsels of caution and delay. The daring advice of Rizzio fell in with her
natural temper. She resolved to restore Catholicism in Scotland. Yield as she might to Murray's
pressure, she had dexterously refrained from giving legal confirmation to the resolutions of
the Parliament by which Calvinism had been set up in Scotland; and in the Parliament which
she summoned for the coming spring she trusted to do "some good anent restoring the old religion."
The appearance of the Catholic lords, the Earls of Huntly, Athol, and Bothwell, at Mary's court
showed her purpose to attempt this religious revolution. Nor were her political schemes less
resolute. She was determined to wring from the coming Parliament a confirmation of the banishment
of the lords who had fled with Murray which would free her for ever from the pressure of the
Protestant nobles. Mistress of her kingdom, politically as well as religiously, Mary could
put a pressure on Elizabeth which might win for her more than an acknowledgement of her right
to the succession. She still clung to her hopes of the crown; and she knew that the Catholics
of Northumberland and Yorkshire were ready to revolt as soon as she was ready to aid them.

[Sidenote: The murder of Rizzio.]

No such danger had ever threatened Elizabeth as this. But again she could "trust to fortune."
Mary had staked all on her union with Darnley, and yet only a few months had passed since her
wedding-day when men saw that she "hated the King." The boy turned out a dissolute, insolent
husband; and Mary's scornful refusal of his claim of the "crown matrimonial," which would have
given him an equal share of the royal power with herself, widened the breach between them.
Darnley attributed this refusal to Rizzio's counsels; and his father, Lord Lennox, joined with
him in plotting vengeance against the secretary. They sought aid from the very party whom Darnley's
marriage had been planned to crush. Though the strength of the Protestant nobles had been broken
by the flight of Murray, the Douglases remained at the court. Morton had no purpose of lending
himself to the ruin of the religion he professed, and Ruthven and Lindesay were roused to action
when they saw themselves threatened with a restoration of Catholicism, and with a legal banishment
of Murray and his companions in the coming Parliament, which could only serve as a prelude
to their own ruin. Rizzio was the author of this policy; and when Darnley called on his kinsmen
to aid him in attacking Rizzio, the Douglases grasped at his proposal. Their aid and their
promise of the crown matrimonial were bought by Darnley's consent to the recall of the fugitive
lords and of Murray. The plot of the Douglases was so jealously hidden that no whisper of it
reached the Queen. Her plans were on the brink of success. The Catholic nobles were ready for
action at her court. Huntly and Bothwell were called into the Privy Council. At the opening
of March 1566 the Parliament which was to carry out her projects was to assemble; and the Queen
prepared for her decisive stroke by naming men whom she could trust as Lords of the Articles--a
body with whom lay the proposal of measures to the Houses--and by restoring the bishops to
their old places among the peers. But at the moment when Mary revealed the extent of her schemes
by her dismissal of the English ambassador, the young king, followed by Lord Ruthven, burst
into her chamber, dragged Rizzio from her presence, and stabbed him in an outer chamber, while
Morton and Lord Lindesay with their followers seized the palace gate. Mary found herself a
prisoner in the hands of her husband and his confederates. Her plans were wrecked in an hour.
A proclamation of the king dissolved the Parliament which she had called for the ruin of her
foes; and Murray, who was on his way back from England when the deed was done, was received
at Court and restored to his old post at the Council-board.

[Sidenote: Mary's revenge.]

Terrible as the blow had been, it roused the more terrible energies which lay hid beneath the
graceful bearing of the Queen. The darker features of her character were now to develope themselves.
With an inflexible will she turned to build up again the policy which seemed shattered in Rizzio's
murder. Her passionate resentment bent to the demands of her ambition. "No more tears," she
said when they brought her news of Rizzio's murder; "I will think upon revenge." But even revenge
was not suffered to interfere with her political schemes. Keen as was Mary's thirst for vengeance
on him, Darnley was needful to the triumph of her aims, and her first effort was to win him
back. He was already grudging at the supremacy of the nobles and his virtual exclusion from
power, when Mary masking her hatred beneath a show of affection succeeded in severing the wretched
boy from his fellow-conspirators, and in gaining his help in an escape to Dunbar. Once free,
a force of eight thousand men under the Earl of Bothwell quickly gathered round her, and with
these troops she marched in triumph on Edinburgh. An offer of pardon to all save those concerned
in Rizzio's murder broke up the force of the Lords; Glencairn and Argyle joined the Queen,
while Morton, Ruthven, and Lindesay fled in terror over the border. But Mary had learned by
a terrible lesson the need of dissimulation. She made no show of renewing her Catholic policy.
On the contrary, she affected to resume the system which she had pursued from the opening of
her reign, and suffered Murray to remain at the court. Rizzio's death, had in fact strengthened
her position. With him passed away the dread of a Catholic reaction. Mary's toleration, her
pledges of extending an equal indulgence to Protestantism in England, should she mount its
throne, her marriage to one who was looked upon as an English noble, above all the hope of
realizing through her succession the dream of a union of the realms, again told on the wavering
body of more Conservative statesmen, like Norfolk, and even drew to her side some of the steadier
Protestants who despaired of a Protestant succession. Even Elizabeth at last seemed wavering
towards a recognition of her as her successor. But Mary aimed at more than the succession.
Her intrigues with the English Catholics were never interrupted. Her seeming reconciliation
with the young king preserved that union of the whole Catholic body which her marriage had
brought about and which the strife over Rizzio threatened with ruin. Her court was full of
refugees from the northern counties. "Your actions," Elizabeth wrote in a sudden break of fierce
candour, "are as full of venom as your words are of honey." Fierce words however did nothing
to break the clouds that gathered thicker and thicker round England: and in June the birth
of a boy, the future James the Sixth of Scotland and First of England, doubled Mary's strength.
Elizabeth felt bitterly the blow. "The Queen of Scots," she cried, "has a fair son, and I am
but a barren stock." The birth of James in fact seemed to settle the long struggle in Mary's
favour. The moderate Conservatives joined the ranks of her adherents. The Catholics were wild
with hope. "Your friends are so increased," her ambassador, Melville, wrote to her from England,
"that many whole shires are ready to rebel, and their captains named by election of the nobility."
On the other hand, the Protestants were filled with despair. It seemed as if no effort could
avert the rule of England by a Catholic Queen.

[Sidenote: The developement of England.]

It was at this moment of peril that the English Parliament was again called together. Its action
showed more than the natural anxiety of the time; it showed the growth of those national forces
which far more than the schemes of Mary or the counter-schemes of Elizabeth were to determine
the future of England. While the two Queens were heaping intrigue on intrigue, while abroad
and at home every statesman held firmly that national welfare or national misery hung on the
fortune of the one or the success of the other, the English people itself was steadily moving
forward to a new spiritual enlightenment and a new political liberty. The intellectual and
religious impulses of the age were already combining with the influence of its growing wealth
to revive a spirit of independence in the nation at large. It was impossible for Elizabeth
to understand this spirit, but her wonderful tact enabled her from the first to feel the strength
of it. Long before any open conflict arose between the people and the Crown we see her instinctive
perception of the changes which were going on around her in the modifications, conscious or
unconscious, which she introduced into the system of the monarchy. Of its usurpations upon
English liberty she abandoned none. But she curtailed and softened down almost all. She tampered,
as her predecessors had tampered, with personal freedom; there was the same straining of statutes
and coercion of juries in political trials as before, and an arbitrary power of imprisonment
was still exercised by the Council. The duties she imposed on cloth and sweet wines were an
assertion of her right of arbitrary taxation. Proclamations in Council constantly assumed the
force of law. But, boldly as it was asserted, the royal power was practically wielded with
a caution and moderation that showed the sense of a growing difficulty in the full exercise
of it. The ordinary course of justice was left undisturbed. The jurisdiction of the Council
was asserted almost exclusively over the Catholics; and defended in their case as a precaution
against pressing dangers. The proclamations issued were temporary in character and of small
importance. The two duties imposed were so slight as to pass almost unnoticed in the general
satisfaction at Elizabeth's abstinence from internal taxation. She abandoned the benevolences
and forced loans which had brought home the sense of tyranny to the subjects of her predecessors.
She treated the Privy Seals, which on emergencies she issued for advances to her Exchequer,
simply as anticipations of her revenue (like our own Exchequer Bills), and punctually repaid
them. The monopolies with which she fettered trade proved a more serious grievance; but during
her earlier reign they were looked on as a part of the system of Merchant Associations, which
were at that time regarded as necessary for the regulation and protection of the growing commerce.

[Sidenote: The advance of the Parliament.]

The political developement of the nation is seen still more in the advance of the Parliament
during Elizabeth's reign. The Queen's thrift enabled her in ordinary times of peace to defray
the current expenses of the Crown from its ordinary revenues. But her thrift was dictated not
so much by economy as by a desire to avoid summoning fresh Parliaments. We have seen how boldly
the genius of Thomas Cromwell set aside on this point the tradition of the New Monarchy. His
confidence in the power of the Crown revived the Parliament as an easy and manageable instrument
of tyranny. The old forms of constitutional freedom were turned to the profit of the royal
despotism, and a revolution which for the moment left England absolutely at Henry's feet was
wrought out by a series of parliamentary statutes. Throughout Henry's reign Cromwell's confidence
was justified by the spirit of slavish submission which pervaded the Houses. But the effect
of the religious change for which his measures made room began to be felt during the minority
of Edward the Sixth; and the debates and divisions on the religious reaction which Mary pressed
on the Parliament were many and violent. A great step forward was marked by the effort of the
Crown to neutralize by "management" an opposition which it could no longer overawe. Not only
was the Parliament packed with nominees of the Crown but new constituencies were created whose
members would follow implicitly its will. For this purpose twenty-two new boroughs were created
under Edward, fourteen under Mary; some, indeed, places entitled to representation by their
wealth and population, but the bulk of them small towns or hamlets which lay wholly at the
disposal of the Royal Council.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth and the Houses.]

Elizabeth adopted the system of her two predecessors both in the creation of boroughs and the
recommendation of candidates; but her keen political instinct soon perceived the inutility
of both expedients. She saw that the "management" of the Houses, so easy under Cromwell, was
becoming harder every day. The very number of the members she called up into the Commons from
nomination boroughs, sixty-two in all, showed the increasing difficulty which the government
found in securing a working majority. The rise of a new nobility enriched by the spoils of
the Church and trained to political life by the stress of events around them was giving fresh
vigour to the House of Lords. The increased wealth of the country gentry as well as the growing
desire to obtain a seat among the Commons brought about the cessation at this time of the old
payment of members by their constituencies. A change too in the borough representation, which
had long been in progress but was now for the first time legally recognized, tended greatly
to increase the vigour and independence of the Lower House. By the terms of the older writs
borough members were required to be chosen from the body of the burgesses; and an act of Henry
the Fifth gave this custom the force of law. But the passing of such an act shows that the
custom was already widely infringed, and by Elizabeth's day act and custom alike had ceased
to have force. Most seats were now filled by representatives who were strange to the borough
itself, and who were often nominees of the great landowners round. But they were commonly men
of wealth and blood whose aim in entering Parliament was a purely political one, and whose
attitude towards the Crown was far bolder and more independent than that of the quiet tradesmen
who preceded them. Elizabeth saw that "management" was of little avail with a house of members
such as these; and she fell back as far as she could on Wolsey's policy of practical abolition.
She summoned Parliaments at longer and longer intervals. By rigid economy, by a policy of balance
and peace, she strove, and for a long time successfully strove, to avoid the necessity of assembling
them at all. But Mary of Scotland and Philip of Spain proved friends to English liberty in
its sorest need. The struggle with Catholicism forced Elizabeth to have more frequent recourse
to her Parliaments, and as she was driven to appeal for increasing supplies the tone of the
Houses rose higher and higher.

[Sidenote: The struggle with the Parliament.]

What made this revival of Parliamentary independence more important was the range which Cromwell's
policy had given to Parliamentary action. In theory the Tudor statesman regarded three cardinal
subjects, matters of trade, matters of religion, and matters of State, as lying exclusively
within the competence of the Crown. But in actual fact such subjects had been treated by Parliament
after Parliament. The whole religious fabric of the realm rested on Parliamentary enactments.
The very title of Elizabeth rested in a Parliamentary statute. When the Houses petitioned at
the outset of her reign for the declaration of a successor and for the Queen's marriage it
was impossible for her to deny their right to intermeddle with these "matters of State," though
she rebuked the demand and evaded an answer. But the question of the succession was a question
too vital for English freedom and English religion to remain prisoned within Elizabeth's council-chamber.
It came again to the front in the Parliament which the pressure from Mary Stuart forced Elizabeth
to assemble after six prorogations and an interval of four years in September 1566. The Lower
House at once resolved that the business of supply should go hand in hand with that of the
succession. Such a step put a stress on the monarchy which it had never known since the War
of the Roses. The Commons no longer confined themselves to limiting or resisting the policy
of the Crown; they dared to dictate it. Elizabeth's wrath showed her sense of the importance
of their action. "They had acted like rebels!" she said, "they had dealt with her as they dared
not have dealt with her father." "I cannot tell," she broke out angrily to the Spanish ambassador,
"what these devils want!" "They want liberty, madam," replied the Spaniard, "and if princes
do not look to themselves and work together to put such people down they will find before long
what all this is coming to!" But Elizabeth had to front more than her Puritan Commons. The
Lords joined with the Lower House in demanding the Queen's marriage and a settlement of the
succession, and after a furious burst of anger Elizabeth gave a promise of marriage, which
she was no doubt resolved to evade as she had evaded it before. But the subject of the succession
was one which could not be evaded. Yet any decision on it meant civil war. It was notorious
that if the Commons were resolute to name the Lady Catharine Grey, the heiress of the House
of Suffolk, successor to the throne, the Lords were as resolute to assert the right of Mary
Stuart. To settle such a matter was at once to draw the sword. The Queen therefore peremptorily
forbade the subject to be approached. But the royal message was no sooner delivered than Wentworth,
a member of the House of Commons, rose to ask whether such a prohibition was not "against the
liberties of Parliament." The question was followed by a hot debate, and a fresh message from
the Queen commanding "that there should be no further argument" was met by a request for freedom
of deliberation while the subsidy bill lay significantly unnoticed on the table. A new strife
broke out when another member of the Commons, Mr. Dalton, denounced the claims put forward
by the Scottish Queen. Elizabeth at once ordered him into arrest. But the Commons prayed for
leave "to confer upon their liberties," and the Queen's prudence taught her that it was necessary
to give way. She released Dalton; she protested to the Commons that "she did not mean to prejudice
any part of the liberties heretofore granted them"; she softened the order of silence into
a request. Won by the graceful concession, the Lower House granted the subsidy and assented
loyally to her wish. But the victory was none the less a real one. No such struggle had taken
place between the Crown and the Commons since the beginning of the New Monarchy; and the struggle
had ended in the virtual defeat of the Crown.

[Sidenote: Shane O'Neill.]

The strife with the Parliament hit Elizabeth hard. It was "secret foes at home," she told the
House as the quarrel passed away in a warm reconciliation, "who thought to work me that mischief
which never foreign enemies could bring to pass, which is the hatred of my Commons. Do you
think that either I am so unmindful of your surety by succession, wherein is all my care, or
that I went about to break your liberties? No! it never was my meaning; but to stay you before
you fell into the ditch." But it was impossible for her to explain the real reasons for her
course, and the dissolution of the Parliament in January 1567 left her face to face with a
national discontent added to the ever-deepening peril from without. To the danger from the
north and from the east was added a danger from the west. The north of Ireland was in full
revolt. From the moment of her accession Elizabeth had realized the risks of the policy of
confiscation and colonization which had been pursued in the island by her predecessor: and
the prudence of Cecil fell back on the safer though more tedious policy of Henry the Eighth.
But the alarm at English aggression had already spread among the natives; and its result was
seen in a revolt of the north, and in the rise of a leader more vigorous and able than any
with whom the Government had had as yet to contend. An acceptance of the Earldom of Tyrone
by the chief of the O'Neills brought about the inevitable conflict between the system of succession
recognized by English and that recognized by Irish law. On the death of the Earl of Tyrone
England acknowledged his eldest son as the heir of his Earldom; while the sept of which he
was the head maintained their older right of choosing a chief from among the members of the
family, and preferred Shane O'Neill, a younger son of less doubtful legitimacy. The Lord Deputy,
the Earl of Sussex, marched northward to settle the question by force of arms; but ere he could
reach Ulster the activity of Shane had quelled the disaffection of his rivals, the O'Donnells
of Donegal, and won over the Scots of Antrim. "Never before," wrote Sussex, "durst Scot or
Irishman look Englishman in the face in plain or wood since I came here"; but Shane fired his
men with a new courage, and charging the Deputy's army with a force hardly half its number
drove it back in rout on Armagh. A promise of pardon induced the Irish chieftain to visit London,
and make an illusory submission, but he was no sooner safe home again than its terms were set
aside; and after a wearisome struggle, in which Shane foiled the efforts of the Lord Deputy
to entrap or to poison him, he remained virtually master of the north. His success stirred
larger dreams of ambition. He invaded Connaught, and pressed Clanrickard hard; while he replied
to the remonstrances of the Council at Dublin with a bold defiance. "By the sword I have won
these lands," he answered, "and by the sword will I keep them." But defiance broke idly against
the skill and vigour of Sir Henry Sidney, who succeeded Sussex as Lord Deputy. The rival septs
of the north were drawn into a rising against O'Neill, while the English army advanced from
the Pale; and in 1567 Shane, defeated by the O'Donnells, took refuge in Antrim, and was hewn
to pieces in a drunken squabble by his Scottish entertainers.

[Sidenote: Bothwell.]

The victory of Sidney marked the turn of the tide which had run so long against Elizabeth.
The danger which England dreaded from Mary Stuart, the terror of a Catholic sovereign and a
Catholic reaction, reached its height only to pass irretrievably away. At the moment when the
Irish revolt was being trampled under foot a terrible event suddenly struck light through the
gathering clouds in the north. Mary had used Darnley as a tool to bring about the ruin of his
confederates and to further her policy; but from the moment that she discovered his actual
complicity in the plot for Rizzio's murder she had loathed and avoided him. Ominous words dropped
from her lips. "Unless she were free of him some way," Mary was heard to mutter, "she had no
pleasure to live." The lords whom he had drawn into his plot only to desert and betray them
hated him with as terrible a hatred, and in their longing for vengeance a new adventurer saw
the road to power. Of all the border nobles James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, was the boldest
and the most unscrupulous. But, Protestant as he was, he had never swerved from the side of
the Crown; he had supported the Regent, and crossed the seas to pledge as firm a support to
Mary; and his loyalty and daring alike appealed to the young Queen's heart. Little as he was
touched by Mary's passion, it stirred in the Earl dreams of a union with the Queen; and great
as were the obstacles to such a union which presented themselves in Mary's marriage and his
own, Bothwell was of too desperate a temper to recoil before obstacles such as these. Divorce
would free him from his own wife. To free himself from Darnley he seized on the hatred which
the lords whom Darnley had deserted and betrayed bore to the king. Bothwell joined Murray and
the English ambassador in praying for the recall of Morton and the exiles. The pardon was granted;
the nobles returned to court, and the bulk of them joined readily in a conspiracy to strike
down one whom they still looked on as their bitterest foe.

[Sidenote: Darnley's murder.]

Morton alone stood aloof. He demanded an assurance of the Queen's sanction to the deed; and
no such assurance was given him. On the contrary Mary's mood seemed suddenly to change. Her
hatred to Darnley passed all at once into demonstration of the old affection. He had fallen
sick with vice and misery, and she visited him on his sick-bed, and persuaded him to follow
her to Edinburgh. She visited him again in a ruinous and lonely house near the palace in which
he was lodged by her order, on the ground that its purer air would further his recovery, kissed
him as she bade him farewell, and rode gaily back to a wedding-dance at Holyrood. If Mary's
passion had drawn her to share Bothwell's guilt, these acts were but awful preludes to her
husband's doom. If on the other hand her reconciliation was a real one, it only drove Bothwell
to hurry on his deed of blood without waiting for the aid of the nobles who had sworn the king's
death. The terrible secret is still hid in a cloud of doubt and mystery which will probably
never be wholly dispelled. But Mary had hardly returned to her palace when, two hours after
midnight on the ninth of February 1567, an awful explosion shook the city. The burghers rushed
out from the gates to find the house of Kirk o' Field destroyed and Darnley's body dead beside
the ruins.

[Sidenote: Mary's fall.]

The murder was undoubtedly the deed of Bothwell. It was soon known that his servant had stored
the powder beneath the king's bedchamber and that the Earl had watched without the walls till
the deed was done. But, in spite of gathering suspicion and of a charge of murder made formally
against Bothwell by Lord Lennox, no serious steps were taken to investigate the crime; and
a rumour that Mary purposed to marry the murderer drove her friends to despair. Her agent in
England wrote to her that "if she married that man she would lose the favour of God, her own
reputation, and the hearts of all England, Ireland, and Scotland." But whatever may have been
the ties of passion or guilt which united them, Mary was now powerless in Bothwell's hands.
While Murray withdrew to France on pretext of travel, the young Earl used the plot against
Darnley into which he had drawn the lords to force from them a declaration that he was guiltless
of the murder and their consent to his marriage with the Queen. He boasted that he would marry
Mary, whether she would or no. Every stronghold in the kingdom was placed in his hands, and
this step was the prelude to a trial and acquittal which the overwhelming force of his followers
in Edinburgh turned into a bitter mockery. The Protestants were bribed by the assembling of
a Parliament in which Mary for the first time gave her sanction to the laws which established
the reformation in Scotland. A shameless suit for his divorce removed the last obstacle to
Bothwell's ambition; and a seizure of the Queen as she rode to Linlithgow, whether real or
fictitious, was followed three weeks later by their union on the fifteenth of May. Mary may
have yielded to force; she may have yielded to passion; it is possible that in Bothwell's vigour
she saw the means of at last mastering the kingdom and wreaking her vengeance on the Lords.
But whatever were her hopes or fears, in a month more all was over. The horror at the Queen's
marriage with a man fresh from her husband's blood drove the whole nation to revolt. The Catholic
party held aloof from a Queen who seemed to have forsaken them by a Protestant marriage and
by her acknowledgement of the Protestant Church. The Protestant Lords seized on the general
horror to free themselves from a master whose subtlety and bloodshed had placed them at his
feet. Morton and Argyle rallied the forces of the Congregation at Stirling, and were soon joined
by the bulk of the Scottish nobles of either religion. Their entrance into Edinburgh roused
the capital into insurrection. On the fifteenth of June Mary and her husband advanced with
a fair force to Seton to encounter the Lords; but their men refused to fight, and Bothwell
galloped off into lifelong exile, while the Queen was brought back to Edinburgh in a frenzy
of despair, tossing back wild words of defiance to the curses of the crowd.

CHAPTER V

ENGLAND AND THE PAPACY

1567-1582

[Sidenote: England and religious change.]

The fall of Mary freed Elizabeth from the most terrible of her outer dangers. But it left her
still struggling with ever-growing dangers at home. The religious peace for which she had fought
so hard was drawing to an end. Sturdily as she might aver to her subjects that no change had
really been made in English religion, that the old faith had only been purified, that the realm
had only been freed from Papal usurpation, jealously as she might preserve the old episcopate,
the old service, the old vestments and usages of public worship, her action abroad told too
plainly its tale. The world was slowly drifting to a gigantic conflict between the tradition
of the past and a faith that rejected the tradition of the past; and in this conflict men saw
that England was ranging itself not on the side of the old belief but of the new. The real
meaning of Elizabeth's attitude was revealed in her refusal to own the Council of Trent. From
that moment the hold which she had retained on all who still clung strongly to Catholic doctrine
was roughly shaken. Her system of conformity received a heavy blow from the decision of the
Papacy that attendance at the common prayer was unlawful. Her religious compromise was almost
destroyed by the victory of the Guises. In the moment of peril she was driven on Protestant
support, and Protestant support had to be bought by a Test Act which excluded every zealous
Catholic from all share in the government or administration of the realm, while the re-enactment
of Edward's Articles by the Convocation of the clergy was an avowal of Protestantism which
none could mistake. Whatever in fact might be Elizabeth's own predilections, even the most
cautious of Englishmen could hardly doubt of the drift of her policy. The hopes which the party
of moderation had founded on a marriage with Philip, or a marriage with the Austrian Archduke,
or a marriage with Dudley, had all passed away. The conciliatory efforts of Pope Pius had been
equally fruitless. The last hope of a quiet undoing of the religious changes lay in the succession
of Mary Stuart. But with the fall of Mary a peaceful return to the older faith became impossible;
and the consciousness of this could hardly fail to wake new dangers for Elizabeth, whether
at home or abroad.

[Sidenote: Progress of the Reformation.]

It was in fact at this moment of seeming triumph that the great struggle of her reign began.
In 1565 a pontiff was chosen to fill the Papal chair whose policy was that of open war between
England and Rome. At no moment in its history had the fortunes of the Roman See sunk so low
as at the accession of Pius the Fifth. The Catholic revival had as yet done nothing to arrest
the march of the Reformation. In less than half a century the new doctrines had spread from
Iceland to the Pyrenees and from Finland to the Alps. When Pius mounted the throne Lutheranism
was firmly established in Scandinavia and in Northern Germany. Along the Eastern border of
the Empire it had conquered Livonia and Old Prussia; its adherents formed a majority of the
nobles of Poland; Hungary seemed drifting towards heresy; and in Transylvania the Diet had
already confiscated all Church lands. In Central Germany the great prelates whose princedoms
covered so large a part of Franconia opposed in vain the spread of Lutheran doctrine. It seemed
as triumphant in Southern Germany, for the Duchy of Austria was for the most part Lutheran,
and many of the Bavarian towns with a large part of the Bavarian nobles had espoused the cause
of the Reformation. In Western Europe the fiercer doctrines of Calvinism took the place of
the faith of Luther. At the death of Henry the Second Calvin's missionaries poured from Geneva
over France, and in a few years every province of the realm was dotted with Calvinistic churches.
The Huguenots rose into a great political and religious party which struggled openly for the
mastery of the realm and wrested from the Crown a legal recognition of its existence and of
freedom of worship. The influence of France told quickly on the regions about it. The Rhineland
was fast losing its hold on Catholicism. In the Netherlands, where the persecutions of Charles
the Fifth had failed to check the upgrowth of heresy, his successor saw Calvinism win state
after state, and gird itself to a desperate struggle at once for religious and for civil independence.
Still farther west a sudden revolution had won Scotland for the faith of Geneva; and a revolution
hardly less sudden, though marked with consummate subtlety, had in effect added England to
the Churches of the Reformation. Christendom in fact was almost lost to the Papacy; for only
two European countries owned its sway without dispute. "There remain firm to the Pope," wrote
a Venetian ambassador to his State, "only Spain and Italy with some few islands, and those
countries possessed by your Serenity in Dalmatia and Greece."

[Sidenote: Pius the Fifth.]

It was at this moment of defeat that Pius the Fifth mounted the Papal throne. His earlier life
had been that of an Inquisitor; and he combined the ruthlessness of a persecutor with the ascetic
devotion of a saint. Pius had but one end, that of reconquering Christendom, of restoring the
rebel nations to the fold of the Church, and of stamping out heresy by fire and sword. To his
fiery faith every means of warfare seemed hallowed by the sanctity of his cause. The despotism
of the prince, the passion of the populace, the sword of the mercenary, the very dagger of
the assassin, were all seized without scruple as weapons in the warfare of God. The ruthlessness
of the Inquisitor was turned into the world-wide policy of the Papacy. When Philip doubted
how to deal with the troubles in the Netherlands, Pius bade him deal with them by force of
arms. When the Pope sent soldiers of his own to join the Catholics in France he bade their
leader "slay instantly whatever heretic fell into his hands." The massacres of Alva were rewarded
by a gift of the consecrated hat and sword, as the massacre of St. Bartholomew was hailed by
the successor of Pius with a solemn thanksgiving. The force of the Pope's effort lay in its
concentration of every energy on a single aim. Rome drew in fact a new power from the ruin
of her schemes of secular aggrandizement. The narrower hopes and dreads which had sprung from
their position as Italian princes told no longer on the Popes. All hope of the building up
of a wider princedom passed away. The hope of driving the stranger from Italy came equally
to an end. But on the other hand Rome was screened from the general conflicts of the secular
powers. It was enabled to be the friend of every Catholic State, and that at a moment when
every Catholic State saw in the rise of Calvinism a new cause for seeking its friendship. Calvinism
drew with it a thirst for political liberty, and religious revolution became the prelude to
political revolution. From this moment therefore the cause of the Papacy became the cause of
kings, and a craving for self-preservation rallied the Catholic princes round the Papal throne.
The same dread of utter ruin rallied round it the Catholic Church. All strife, all controversy
was hushed in the presence of the foe. With the close of the Council of Trent came a unity
of feeling and of action such as had never been seen before. Faith was defined. The Papal authority
stood higher than ever. The bishops owned themselves to be delegates of the Roman See. The
clergy were drawn together into a disciplined body by the institution of seminaries. The new
religious orders carried everywhere the watchword of implicit obedience. As the heresy of Calvin
pressed on to one victory after another, the Catholic world drew closer and closer round the
standard of Rome.

[Sidenote: England and Rome.]

What raised the warfare of Pius into grandeur was the scale upon which he warred. His hand
was everywhere throughout Christendom. Under him Rome became the political as well as the religious
centre of Western Europe. The history of the Papacy widened again, as in the Middle Ages, into
the history of the world. Every scheme of the Catholic resistance was devised or emboldened
at Rome. While her Jesuit emissaries won a new hold in Bavaria and Southern Germany, rolled
back the tide of Protestantism in the Rhineland, and by school and pulpit laboured to re-Catholicize
the Empire, Rome spurred Mary Stuart to the Darnley marriage, urged Philip to march Alva on
the Netherlands, broke up the religious truce which Catharine had won for France, and celebrated
with solemn pomp the massacre of the Huguenots. England above all was the object of Papal attack.
The realm of Elizabeth was too important for the general Papal scheme of reconquering Christendom
to be lightly let go. England alone could furnish a centre to the reformed communions of Western
Europe. The Lutheran states of North Germany were too small. The Scandinavian kingdoms were
too remote. Scotland hardly ranked as yet as a European power. Even if France joined the new
movement her influence would long be neutralized by the strife of the religious parties within
her pale. But England was to outer seeming a united realm. Her government held the country
firmly in hand. Whether as an island or from her neighbourhood to the chief centres of the
religious strife, she was so placed as to give an effective support to the new opinions. Protestant
refugees found a safe shelter within her bounds. Her trading ships diffused heresy in every
port they touched at. She could at little risk feed the Calvinistic revolution in France or
the Netherlands. In the great battle of the old faith and the new England was thus the key
of the reformed position. With England Protestant the fight against Protestantism could only
be a slow and doubtful one. On the other hand a Catholic England would render religious revolution
in the west all but hopeless. Hand in hand with Philip religiously, as she already was politically,
the great island might turn the tide of the mighty conflict which had so long gone against
the Papacy.

[Sidenote: Philip and the Netherlands.]

It was from this sense of the importance of England in the world-wide struggle which it was
preparing that Rome had watched with such a feverish interest the effort of Mary Stuart. Her
victory would have given to Catholicism the two westernmost realms of the Reformation, England
and Scotland; it would have aided it in the reconquest of the Netherlands and of France. No
formal bond indeed, such as the Calvinists believed to exist, bound Mary and Pius and Philip
and Catharine of Medicis together in a vast league for the restoration of the Faith; their
difference of political aim held France and Spain obstinately apart both from each other and
from Mary Stuart, and it was only at the Vatican that the great movement was conceived as a
whole. But practically the policy of Mary and Philip worked forward to the same end. While
the Scottish Queen prepared her counter-reformation in England and Scotland, Philip was gathering
a formidable host which was to suppress Calvinism as well as liberty in the Netherlands. Of
the seventeen provinces which Philip had inherited from his father, Charles, in this part of
his dominions, each had its own constitution, its own charter and privileges, its own right
of taxation. All clung to their local independence; and resistance to any projects of centralization
was common to the great nobles and the burghers of the towns. Philip on the other hand was
resolute to bring them by gradual steps to the same level of absolute subjection and incorporation
in the body of the monarchy as the provinces of Castille. The Netherlands were the wealthiest
part of his dominions. Flanders alone contributed more to his exchequer than all his kingdoms
in Spain. With a treasury drained by a thousand schemes Philip longed to have this wealth at
his unfettered disposal, while his absolutism recoiled from the independence of the States,
and his bigotry drove him to tread their heresy under foot. Policy backed the impulses of greed
and fanaticism. In the strangely-mingled mass of the Spanish monarchy, the one bond which held
together its various parts, divided as they were by blood, by tradition, by tongue, was their
common faith. Philip was in more than name the "Catholic King." Catholicism alone united the
burgher of the Netherlands to the nobles of Castille, or Milanese and Neapolitan to the Aztec
of Mexico and Peru. With such an empire heresy meant to Philip political chaos, and the heresy
of Calvin, with its ready organization and its doctrine of resistance, promised not only chaos
but active revolt. In spite therefore of the growing discontent in the Netherlands, in spite
of the alienation of the nobles and the resistance of the Estates, he clung to a system of
government which ignored the liberties of every province, and to a persecution which drove
thousands of skilled workmen to the shores of England.

[Sidenote: Alva.]

At last the general discontent took shape in open resistance. The success of the French Huguenots
in wresting the free exercise of their faith from the monarchy told on the Calvinists of the
Low Countries. The nobles gathered in leagues. Riots broke out in the towns. The churches were
sacked, and heretic preachers preached in the open fields to multitudes who carried weapons
to protect them. If Philip's system was to continue it must be by force of arms, and the king
seized the disturbances as a pretext for dealing a blow he had long meditated at the growing
heresy of this portion of his dominions. Pius the Fifth pressed him to deal with heresy by
the sword, and in 1567 an army of ten thousand men gathered in Italy under the Duke of Alva
for a march on the Low Countries. Had Alva reached the Netherlands while Mary was still in
the flush of her success, it is hard to see how England could have been saved. But again Fortune
proved Elizabeth's friend. The passion of Mary shattered the hopes of Catholicism, and at the
moment when Alva led his troops over the Alps Mary passed a prisoner within the walls of Lochleven.
Alone however the Duke was a mighty danger: nor could any event have been more embarrassing
to Elizabeth than his arrival in the Netherlands in the autumn of 1567. The terror he inspired
hushed all thought of resistance. The towns were occupied. The heretics were burned. The greatest
nobles were sent to the block or driven, like William of Orange, from the country. The Netherlands
lay at Philip's feet; and Alva's army lowered like a thundercloud over the Protestant West.

[Sidenote: Mary's abdication.]

The triumph of Catholicism and the presence of a Catholic army in a country so closely connected
with England at once revived the dreams of a Catholic rising against Elizabeth's throne, while
the news of Alva's massacres stirred in every one of her Protestant subjects a thirst for revenge
which it was hard to hold in check. Yet to strike a blow at Alva was impossible. Antwerp was
the great mart of English trade, and a stoppage of the trade with Flanders, such as war must
bring about, would have broken half the merchants in London. Elizabeth could only look on while
the Duke trod resistance and heresy under foot, and prepared in the Low Countries a securer
starting-point for his attack on Protestantism in the West. With Elizabeth, indeed, or her
cautious and moderate Lutheranism Philip had as yet little will to meddle, however hotly Rome
might urge him to attack her. He knew that the Calvinism of the Netherlands looked for support
to the Calvinism of France; and as soon as Alva's work was done in the Low Countries the Duke
had orders to aid the Guises in assailing the Huguenots. But the terror of the Huguenots precipitated
the strife, and while Alva was still busy with attacks from the patriots under the princes
of the house of Orange a fresh rising in France woke the civil war at the close of 1567. Catharine
lulled this strife for the moment by a new edict of toleration; but the presence of Alva was
stirring hopes and fears in other lands than France. Between Mary Stuart and the lords who
had imprisoned her in Lochleven reconciliation was impossible. Elizabeth, once lightened of
her dread from Mary, would have been content with a restoration of Murray's actual supremacy.
Already alarmed by Calvinistic revolt against monarchy in France, she was still more alarmed
by the success of Calvinistic revolt against monarchy in Scotland; and the presence of Alva
in the Netherlands made her anxious above all to settle the troubles in the north and to devise
some terms of reconciliation between Mary and her subjects. But it was in vain that she demanded
the release of the Queen. The Scotch Protestants, with Knox at their head, called loudly for
Mary's death, as a murderess. If the lords shrank from such extremities, they had no mind to
set her free and to risk their heads for Elizabeth's pleasure. As the price of her life they
forced Mary to resign her crown in favour of her child, and to name Murray, who was now returning
from France, as regent during his minority. In July 1567 the babe was solemnly crowned as James
the Sixth.

[Sidenote: Langside.]

But Mary had only consented to abdicate because she felt sure of escape. With an infant king
the regency of Murray promised to be a virtual sovereignty; and the old factions of Scotland
woke again into life. The house of Hamilton, which stood next in succession to the throne,
became the centre of a secret league which gathered to it the nobles and prelates who longed
for the re-establishment of Catholicism, and who saw in Alva's triumph a pledge of their own.
The regent's difficulties were doubled by the policy of Elizabeth. Her wrath at the revolt
of subjects against their Queen, her anxiety that "by this example none of her own be encouraged,"
only grew with the disregard of her protests and threats. In spite of Cecil she refused to
recognize Murray's government, renewed her demands for the Queen's release, and encouraged
the Hamiltons in their designs of freeing her. She was in fact stirred by more fears than her
dread of Calvinism and of Calvinistic liberty. Philip's triumph in the Netherlands and the
presence of his army across the sea was filling the Catholics of the northern counties with
new hopes, and scaring Elizabeth from any joint action with the Scotch Calvinists which might
call the Spanish forces over sea. She even stooped to guard against any possible projects of
Philip by fresh negotiations for a marriage with one of the Austrian archdukes. But the negotiations
proved as fruitless as before, while Scotland moved boldly forward in its new career. A Parliament
which assembled at the opening of 1568 confirmed the deposition of the Queen, and made Catholic
worship punishable with the pain of death. The triumph of Calvinistic bigotry only hastened
the outbreak which had long been preparing, and at the beginning of May an escape of Mary from
her prison was a signal for civil war. Five days later six thousand men gathered round her
at Hamilton, and Argyle joined the Catholic lords who rallied to her banner. The news found
different welcomes at the English court. Elizabeth at once offered to arbitrate between Mary
and her subjects. Cecil, on the other hand, pressed Murray to strike quick and hard. But the
regent needed little pressing. Surprised as he was, Murray was quickly in arms; and cutting
off Mary's force as it moved on Dumbarton, he brought it to battle at Langside on the Clyde
on the thirteenth of May, and broke it in a panic-stricken rout. Mary herself, after a fruitless
effort to reach Dumbarton, fled southwards to find a refuge in Galloway. A ride of ninety miles
brought her to the Solway, but she found her friends wavering in her support and ready to purchase
pardon from Murray by surrendering her into the regent's hands. From that moment she abandoned
all hope from Scotland. She believed that Elizabeth would in the interests of monarchy restore
her to the throne; and changing her designs with the rapidity of genius, she pushed in a light
boat across the Solway, and was safe before the evening fell in the castle of Carlisle.

[Sidenote: Mary in England.]

The presence of Alva in Flanders was a far less peril than the presence of Mary in Carlisle.
To restore her, as she demanded, by force of arms was impossible. If Elizabeth was zealous
for the cause of monarchy, she had no mind to crush the nobles who had given her security against
her rival simply to seat that rival triumphantly on the throne. On the other hand to retain
her in England was to furnish a centre for revolt. Mary herself indeed threatened that "if
they kept her prisoner they should have enough to do with her." If the Queen would not aid
in her restoration to the throne, she demanded a free passage to France. But compliance with
such a request would have given the Guises a terrible weapon against Elizabeth and have ensured
French intervention in Scotland. For a while Elizabeth hoped to bring Murray to receive Mary
back peaceably as Queen. But the regent refused to sacrifice himself and the realm to Elizabeth's
policy. When the Duke of Norfolk with other commissioners appeared at York to hold a formal
enquiry into Mary's conduct with a view to her restoration, Murray openly charged the Queen
with a share in the murder of her husband, and he produced letters from her to Bothwell, which
if genuine substantiated the charge. Till Mary was cleared of guilt, Murray would hear nothing
of her return, and Mary refused to submit to such a trial as would clear her. So eager however
was Elizabeth to get rid of the pressing peril of her presence in England that Mary's refusal
to submit to any trial only drove her to fresh devices for her restoration. She urged upon
Murray the suppression of the graver charges, and upon Mary the leaving Murray in actual possession
of the royal power as the price of her return. Neither however would listen to terms which
sacrificed both to Elizabeth's self-interest. The Regent persisted in charging the Queen with
murder and adultery. Mary refused either to answer or to abdicate in favour of her infant son.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth's difficulties.]

The triumph indeed of her bold policy was best advanced, as the Queen of Scots had no doubt
foreseen, by simple inaction. Her misfortunes, her resolute denials, were gradually wiping
away the stain of her guilt and winning back the Catholics of England to her cause. Already
there were plans for her marriage with Norfolk, the head of the English nobles, as for her
marriage with the heir of the Hamiltons. The first match might give her the English crown,
the second could hardly fail to restore her to the crown of Scotland. In any case her presence,
rousing as it did fresh hopes of a Catholic reaction, put pressure on her sister Queen. Elizabeth
"had the wolf by the ears," while the fierce contest which Alva's presence roused in France
and in the Netherlands was firing the temper of the two great parties in England. In the Court,
as in the country, the forces of progress and of resistance stood at last in sharp and declared
opposition to each other. Cecil at the head of the Protestants demanded a general alliance
with the Protestant churches throughout Europe, a war in the Low Countries against Alva, and
the unconditional surrender of Mary to her Scotch subjects for the punishment she deserved.
The Catholics on the other hand, backed by the mass of the Conservative party with the Duke
of Norfolk at its head, and supported by the wealthier merchants who dreaded the ruin of the
Flemish trade, were as earnest in demanding the dismissal of Cecil and the Protestants from
the council-board, a steady peace with Spain, and, though less openly, a recognition of Mary's
succession. Elizabeth was driven to temporize as before. She refused Cecil's counsels; but
she sent money and arms to Condé, and hampered Alva by seizing treasure on its way to him,
and by pushing the quarrel even to a temporary embargo on shipping either side the sea. She
refused the counsels of Norfolk; but she would hear nothing of a declaration of war, or give
any judgement on the charges against the Scottish Queen, or recognize the accession of James
in her stead.

[Sidenote: Norfolk.]

But to the pressure of Alva and Mary was now added the pressure of Rome. With the triumph of
Philip in the Netherlands and of the Guises in France Pius the Fifth held that the time had
come for a decisive attack on Elizabeth. If Philip held back from playing the champion of Catholicism,
if even the insults to Alva failed to stir him to active hostility, Rome could still turn to
its adherents within the realm. Pius had already sent two envoys in 1567 with powers to absolve
the English Catholics who had attended church from their schism, but to withdraw all hope of
future absolution for those who continued to conform. The result of their mission however had
been so small that it was necessary to go further. The triumph of Alva in the Netherlands,
the failure of the Prince of Orange in an attempt to rescue them from the Spanish army, the
terror-struck rising of the French Huguenots, the growing embarrassments of Elizabeth both
at home and abroad, seemed to offer Rome its opportunity of delivering a final blow. In February
1569 the Queen was declared a heretic by a Bull which asserted in their strongest form the
Papal claims to a temporal supremacy over princes. As a heretic and excommunicate, she was
"deprived of her pretended right to the said kingdom," her subjects were absolved from allegiance
to her, commanded "not to dare to obey her," and anathematized if they did obey. The Bull was
not as yet promulgated, but Dr. Morton was sent into England to denounce the Queen as fallen
from her usurped authority, and to promise the speedy issue of the sentence of deposition.
The religious pressure was backed by political intrigue. Ridolfi, an Italian merchant settled
in London, who had received full powers and money from Rome, knit the threads of a Catholic
revolt in the north, and drew the Duke of Norfolk into correspondence with Mary Stuart. The
Duke was the son of Lord Surrey and grandson of the Norfolk who had headed the Conservative
party through the reign of Henry the Eighth. Like the rest of the English peers, he had acquiesced
in the religious compromise of the Queen. It was as a Protestant that the more Conservative
among his fellow-nobles now supported a project for his union with the Scottish Queen. With
an English and Protestant husband it was thought that Murray and the lords might safely take
back Mary to the Scottish throne, and England again accept her as the successor to her crown.
But Norfolk was not contented with a single game. From the Pope and Philip he sought aid in
his marriage-plot as a Catholic at heart, whose success would bring about a restoration of
Catholicism throughout the realm. With the Catholic lords he plotted the overthrow of Cecil
and the renewal of friendship with Spain. To carry out schemes such as these however required
a temper of subtler and bolder stamp than the Duke's: Cecil found it easy by playing on his
greed to part him from his fellow-nobles; his marriage with Mary as a Protestant was set aside
by Murray's refusal to accept her as Queen; and Norfolk promised to enter into no correspondence
with Mary Stuart but with Elizabeth's sanction.

[Sidenote: The Catholic Earls.]

The hope of a crown, whether in Scotland or at home, proved too great however for his good
faith, and Norfolk was soon wrapped anew in the net of papal intrigue. But it was not so much
on Norfolk that Rome counted as on the nobles of the North. The three great houses of the northern
border--the Cliffords of Cumberland, the Nevilles of Westmoreland, the Percies of Northumberland--had
remained Catholics at heart; and from the moment of Mary's entrance into England they had been
only waiting for a signal of revolt. They looked for foreign aid, and foreign aid now seemed
assured. In spite of Elizabeth's help the civil war in France went steadily against the Huguenots.
In March 1569 their army was routed at Jarnac, and their leader, Condé, left dead on the field.
The joy with which the victory was greeted by the English Catholics sprang from a consciousness
that the victors looked on it as a prelude to their attack on Protestantism across the sea.
No sooner indeed was this triumph won than Mary's uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine, as the head
of the house of Guise, proposed to Philip to complete the victory of Catholicism by uniting
the forces of France and Spain against Elizabeth. The moment was one of peril such as England
had never known. Norfolk was still pressing forward to a marriage with Mary; he was backed
by the second great Conservative peer, Lord Arundel, and supported by a large part of the nobles.
The Northern Earls with Lords Montague and Lumley and the head of the great house of Dacres
were ready to take up arms, and sure--as they believed--of the aid of the Earls of Derby and
Shrewsbury. Both parties of plotters sought Philip's sanction and placed themselves at his
disposal. A descent of French and Spanish troops would have called both to the field. But much
as Philip longed for a triumph of religion he had no mind for a triumph of France. France now
meant the Guises, and to set their niece Mary Stuart on the English throne was to ensure the
close union of England and the France they ruled. Though he suffered Alva therefore to plan
the despatch of a force from the Netherlands should a Catholic revolt prove successful, he
refused to join in a French attack.

[Sidenote: The revolt of the Earls.]

But the Papal exhortations and the victories of the Guises did their work without Philip's
aid. The conspirators of the north only waited for Norfolk's word to rise in arms. But the
Duke dissembled and delayed, while Elizabeth, roused at last to her danger, struck quick and
hard. Mary Stuart was given in charge to the Puritan Lord Huntingdon. The Earls of Arundel
and Pembroke, with Lord Lumley, were secured. Norfolk himself, summoned peremptorily to court,
dared not disobey; and found himself at the opening of October a prisoner in the Tower. The
more dangerous plot was foiled, for whatever were Norfolk's own designs, most of his Conservative
partizans were good Protestants, and their aim of securing the succession by a Protestant marriage
for Mary was one with which the bulk of the nation would have sympathized. But the Catholic
plot remained; and in October the hopes of its leaders were stirred afresh by a new defeat
of the Huguenots at Montcontour; while a Papal envoy, Dr. Morton, goaded them to action by
news that a Bull of Deposition was ready at Rome. At last a summons to court tested the loyalty
of the Earls, and on the tenth of November 1569 Northumberland gave the signal for a rising.
He was at once joined by the Earl of Westmoreland, and in a few days the Earls entered Durham
and called the North to arms. They shrank from an open revolt against the Queen, and demanded
only the dismissal of her ministers and the recognition of Mary's right of succession. But
with these demands went a pledge to re-establish the Catholic religion. The Bible and Prayer-Book
were torn to pieces, and Mass said once more at the altar of Durham Cathedral, before the Earls
pushed on to Doncaster with an army which soon swelled to thousands of men. Their cry was "to
reduce all causes of religion to the old custom and usage"; and the Earl of Sussex, her general
in the North, wrote frankly to Elizabeth that "there were not ten gentlemen in Yorkshire that
did allow [approve] her proceedings in the cause of religion." But he was as loyal as he was
frank, and held York stoutly while the Queen ordered Mary's hasty removal to a new prison at
Coventry. The storm however broke as rapidly as it had gathered. Leonard Dacres held aloof.
Lord Derby proved loyal. The Catholic lords of the south refused to stir without help from
Spain. The mass of the Catholics throughout the country made no sign; and the Earls no sooner
halted irresolute in presence of this unexpected inaction than their army caught the panic
and dispersed. Northumberland and Westmoreland fled in the middle of December, and were followed
in their flight by Leonard Dacres of Naworth, while their miserable adherents paid for their
disloyalty in bloodshed and ruin.

[Sidenote: The Bull of Deposition.]

The ruthless measures of repression which followed this revolt were the first breach in the
clemency of Elizabeth's rule. But they were signs of terror which were not lost on her opponents.
It was the general inaction of the Catholics which had foiled the hopes of the northern Earls;
and Pope Pius resolved to stir them to activity by publishing in March 1570 the Bull of Excommunication
and Deposition which had been secretly issued in the preceding year. In his Bull Pius declared
that Elizabeth had forfeited all right to the throne, released her subjects from their oath
of allegiance to her, and forbade her nobles and people to obey her on pain of excommunication.
In spite of the efforts of the Government to prevent the entry of any copies of this sentence
into the realm the Bull was found nailed in a spirit of ironical defiance on the Bishop of
London's door. Its effect was far from being what Rome desired. With the exception of one or
two zealots the English Catholics treated the Bull as a dead letter. The duty of obeying the
Queen seemed a certain thing to them, while that of obeying the Pope in temporal matters was
denied by most and doubted by all. Its spiritual effect indeed was greater. The Bull dealt
a severe blow to the religious truce which Elizabeth had secured. In the North the Catholics
withdrew stubbornly from the national worship, and everywhere throughout the realm an increase
in the number of recusants showed the obedience of a large body of Englishmen to the Papal
command. To the minds of English statesmen such an obedience to the Papal bidding in matters
of religion only heralded an obedience to the Papal bidding in matters of state. In issuing
the Bull of Deposition Pius had declared war upon the Queen. He had threatened her throne.
He had called on her subjects to revolt. If his secret pressure had stirred the rising of the
Northern Earls, his open declaration of war might well rouse a general insurrection of Catholics
throughout the realm, while the plots of his agents threatened the Queen's life.

[Sidenote: The Ridolfi plot.]

How real was the last danger was shown at this moment by the murder of Murray. In January 1570
a Catholic partizan, James Hamilton, shot the Regent in the streets of Linlithgow; and Scotland
plunged at once into war between the adherents of Mary and those of her son. The blow broke
Elizabeth's hold on Scotland at a moment when conspiracy threatened her hold on England itself.
The defeat of the Earls had done little to check the hopes of the Roman court. Its intrigues
were busier than ever. At the close of the rising Norfolk was released from the Tower, but
he was no sooner free than he renewed his correspondence with the Scottish Queen. Mary consented
to wed him, and the Duke, who still professed himself a Protestant, trusted to carry the bulk
of the English nobles with him in pressing a marriage which seemed to take Mary out of the
hands of French and Catholic intriguers, to make her an Englishwoman, and to settle the vexed
question of the succession to the throne. But it was only to secure this general adhesion that
Norfolk delayed to declare himself a Catholic. He sought the Pope's approval of his plans,
and appealed to Philip for the intervention of a Spanish army. At the head of this appeal stood
the name of Mary; while Norfolk's name was followed by those of many lords of "the old blood,"
as the prouder peers styled themselves. The significance of the request was heightened by gatherings
of Catholic refugees at Antwerp in the heart of Philip's dominions in the Low Countries round
the fugitive leaders of the Northern Revolt. The intervention of the Pope was brought to quicken
Philip's slow designs. Ridolfi, as the agent of the conspirators, appeared at Rome and laid
before Pius their plans for the marriage of Norfolk and Mary, the union of both realms under
the Duke and the Scottish Queen, and the seizure of Elizabeth and her counsellors at one of
the royal country houses. Pius backed the project with his warm approval, and Ridolfi hurried
to secure the needful aid from Philip of Spain.

[Sidenote: Norfolk's death.]

Enough of these conspiracies was discovered to rouse a fresh ardour in the menaced Protestants.
While Ridolfi was negotiating at Rome and Madrid, the Parliament met to pass an act of attainder
against the Northern Earls, and to declare the introduction of Papal Bulls into the country
an act of high treason. It was made treason to call the Queen heretic or schismatic, or to
deny her right to the throne. The rising indignation against Mary, as "the daughter of Debate,
who discord fell doth sow," was shown in a statute, which declared any person who laid claim
to the Crown during the Queen's lifetime incapable of ever succeeding to it. The disaffection
of the Catholics was met by imposing on all magistrates and public officers the obligation
of subscribing to the Articles of Faith, a measure which in fact transferred the administration
of justice and public order to their Protestant opponents, by forbidding conversions to Catholicism
or the bringing into England of Papal absolutions or objects consecrated by the Pope. Meanwhile
Ridolfi was struggling in vain against Philip's caution. The king made no objection to the
seizure or assassination of Elizabeth. The scheme secured his fullest sympathy; no such opportunity,
he held, would ever offer again; and he longed to finish the affair quickly before France should
take part in it. But he could not be brought to send troops to England before Elizabeth was
secured. If troops were once sent, the failure of the plot would mean war with England; and
with fresh troubles threatening Alva's hold on the Netherlands Philip had no mind to risk an
English war. Norfolk on the other hand had no mind to risk a rising before Spanish troops were
landed, and Ridolfi's efforts failed to bring either Duke or king to action. But the clue to
these negotiations had long been in Cecil's hands; and at the opening of 1571 Norfolk's schemes
of ambition were foiled by his arrest. He was convicted of treason, and after a few months'
delay executed at the Tower.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth and England.]

With the death of Norfolk and that of Northumberland, who followed him to the scaffold, the
dread of revolt within the realm which had so long hung over England passed quietly away. The
failure of the two attempts not only showed the weakness and disunion of the party of discontent
and reaction, but it revealed the weakness of all party feeling before the rise of a national
temper which was springing naturally out of the peace of Elizabeth's reign, and which a growing
sense of danger to the order and prosperity around it was fast turning into a passionate loyalty
to the Queen. It was not merely against Cecil's watchfulness or Elizabeth's cunning that Mary
and Philip and the Percies dashed themselves in vain; it was against a new England. And this
England owed its existence to the Queen. "I have desired," Elizabeth said proudly to her Parliament,
"to have the obedience of my subjects by love, and not by compulsion." Through the fourteen
years which had passed since she mounted the throne, her subjects' love had been fairly won
by justice and good government. The current of political events had drawn men's eyes chiefly
to the outer dangers of the country, to the policy of Philip and of Rome, to the revolutions
of France, to the pressure from Mary Stuart. No one had watched these outer dangers so closely
as the Queen. But buried as she seemed in foreign negotiations and intrigues, Elizabeth was
above all an English sovereign. She devoted herself ably and energetically to the task of civil
administration. At the first moment of relief from the pressure of outer troubles, after the
treaty of Edinburgh, she faced the two main causes of internal disorder. The debasement of
the coinage was brought to an end in 1560. In 1561 a commission was issued to enquire into
the best means of facing the problem of social pauperism.

[Sidenote: The Poor Laws.]

Time, and the natural developement of new branches of industry, were working quietly for the
relief of the glutted labour market; but a vast mass of disorder still existed in England,
which found a constant ground of resentment in the enclosures and evictions which accompanied
the progress of agricultural change. It was on this host of "broken men" that every rebellion
could count for support; their mere existence was an encouragement to civil war; while in peace
their presence was felt in the insecurity of life and property, in bands of marauders which
held whole counties in terror, and in "sturdy beggars" who stripped travellers on the road.
Under Elizabeth as under her predecessors the terrible measures of repression, whose uselessness
More had in vain pointed out, went pitilessly on. We find the magistrates of Somersetshire
capturing a gang of a hundred at a stroke, hanging fifty at once on the gallows, and complaining
bitterly to the Council of the necessity for waiting till the Assizes before they could enjoy
the spectacle of the fifty others hanging beside them. But the Government were dealing with
the difficulty in a wiser and more effectual way. The old powers to enforce labour on the idle
and settlement on the vagrant class which had been given by statutes of Henry the Eighth were
continued; and each town and parish was held responsible for the relief of its indigent and
disabled poor, as well as for the employment of able-bodied mendicants. But a more efficient
machinery was gradually devised for carrying out the relief and employment of the poor. Funds
for this purpose had been provided by the collection of alms in church; but by an Act of 1562
the mayor of each town and the churchwardens of each country parish were directed to draw up
lists of all inhabitants able to contribute to such a fund, and on a persistent refusal the
justices in sessions were empowered to assess the offender at a fitting sum and to enforce
its payment by imprisonment.

The principles embodied in these measures, that of local responsibility for local distress,
and that of a distinction between the pauper and the vagabond, were more clearly defined in
a statute of 1572. By this Act the justices in the country districts, and mayors and other
officers in towns, were directed to register the impotent poor, to settle them in fitting habitations
and to assess all inhabitants for their support. Overseers were appointed to enforce and superintend
their labour, for which wool, hemp, flax, or other stuff was to be provided at the expense
of the inhabitants; and houses of correction were established in every county for obstinate
vagabonds or for paupers refusing to work at the overseer's bidding. A subsequent Act transferred
to these overseers the collection of the poor rate, and powers were given to bind poor children
as apprentices, to erect buildings for the improvident poor, and to force the parents and children
of such paupers to maintain them. The well-known Act which matured and finally established
this system, the 43rd of Elizabeth, remained the base of our system of pauper-administration
until a time within the recollection of living men. Whatever flaws a later experience has found
in these measures, their wise and humane character formed a striking contrast to the legislation
which had degraded our statute-book from the date of the Statute of Labourers; and their efficacy
at the time was proved by the cessation of the social danger against which they were intended
to provide.

[Sidenote: Growth of wealth.]

Its cessation however was owing, not merely to law, but to the natural growth of wealth and
industry throughout the country. A middle class of wealthier landowners and merchants was fast
rising into importance. "The wealth of the meaner sort," wrote one to Cecil, "is the very fount
of rebellion, the occasion of their indolence, of the contempt of the nobility, and of the
hatred they have conceived against them." But Cecil and his mistress could watch the upgrowth
of national wealth with cooler eyes. In the country its effect was to undo much of the evil
which the diminution of small holdings had done. Whatever social embarrassment it might bring
about, the revolution in agriculture which Latimer deplored undoubtedly favoured production.
Not only was a larger capital brought to bear upon the land, but the mere change in the system
of cultivation introduced a taste for new and better modes of farming; the breed of horses
and of cattle was improved, and a far greater use made of manure and dressings. One acre under
the new system produced, it was said, as much as two under the old. As a more careful and constant
cultivation was introduced, a greater number of hands came to be required on every farm; and
much of the surplus labour which had been flung off the land in the commencement of the new
system was thus recalled to it.

[Sidenote: Growth of manufactures.]

A yet more efficient agency in absorbing the unemployed was found in the developement of manufactures.
The linen trade was as yet of small value, and that of silk-weaving was only just introduced.
But the woollen manufacture was fast becoming an important element in the national wealth.
England no longer sent her fleeces to be woven in Flanders and to be dyed at Florence. The
spinning of yarn, the weaving, fulling and dyeing of cloth, were spreading rapidly from the
towns over the country-side. The worsted trade, of which Norwich was the centre, extended over
the whole of the Eastern counties. Farmers' wives began everywhere to spin their wool from
their own sheep's backs into a coarse "home-spun." The South and the West however still remained
the great seats of industry and of wealth, for they were the homes of mining and manufacturing
activity. The iron manufactures were limited to Kent and Sussex, though their prosperity in
this quarter was already threatened by the growing scarcity of the wood which fed their furnaces,
and by the exhaustion of the forests of the Weald. Cornwall was then, as now, the sole exporter
of tin; and the exportation of its copper was just beginning. The broadcloths of the West claimed
the palm among the woollen stuffs of England. The Cinque Ports held almost a monopoly of the
commerce of the Channel. Every little harbour from the Foreland to the Land's End sent out
its fleets of fishing boats, manned with bold seamen who were to furnish crews for Drake and
the Buccaneers. Northern England still lagged far behind the rest of the realm in its industrial
activity. But in the reign of Elizabeth the poverty and inaction to which it had been doomed
for so many centuries began at last to be broken. We see the first sign of the revolution which
has transferred English manufactures and English wealth to the north of the Mersey and of the
Humber in the mention which now meets us of the friezes of Manchester, the coverlets of York,
the cutlery of Sheffield, and the cloth-trade of Halifax.

[Sidenote: Growth of commerce.]

The growth however of English commerce far outstripped as yet that of its manufactures. We
must not judge of it by any modern standard; for the whole population of the country can hardly
have exceeded five or six millions, and the burthen of all the vessels engaged in ordinary
commerce was estimated at little more than fifty thousand tons. The size of the vessels employed
in it would nowadays seem insignificant; a modern collier brig is probably as large as the
biggest merchant vessel which then sailed from the port of London. But it was under Elizabeth
that English commerce began the rapid career of developement which has made us the carriers
of the world. The foundation of the Royal Exchange at London by Sir Thomas Gresham in 1566
was a mark of the commercial progress of the time. By far the most important branch of our
trade was the commerce with Flanders. Antwerp and Bruges were in fact the general marts of
the world in the early part of the sixteenth century, and the annual export of English wool
and drapery to their markets was estimated at a sum of more than two millions in value. But
the religious troubles of the Netherlands were already scaring capital and industry from their
older seats. As early as 1560 Philip's envoy reported to his master that "ten thousand of your
Majesty's servants in the Low Countries are already in England with their preachers and ministers."
Alva's severities soon raised the number of refugees to fifty thousand; and the outbreak of
war which followed drove trade as well as traders from the Low Countries. It was with the ruin
of Antwerp at the time of its siege and capture by the Duke of Parma that the commercial supremacy
of our own capital was first established. A third of the merchants and manufacturers of the
ruined city are said to have found a refuge on the banks of the Thames. The export trade to
Flanders died away as London developed into the general mart of Europe, where the gold and
sugar of the New World were found side by side with the cotton of India, the silks of the East,
and the woollen stuffs of England itself.

[Sidenote: New trade routes.]

Not only was much of the world's older trade transferred by this change to English shores,
but the burst of national vigour which characterized the time found new outlets for its activity.
The fisheries grew more and more valuable. Those of the Channel and the German Ocean gave occupation
to the ports which lined the coast from Yarmouth to Plymouth Haven; while Bristol and Chester
were rivals in the fisheries of Ulster. The merchant-navy of England was fast widening its
sphere of commerce. The Venetian carrying fleet still touched at Southampton; but as far back
as the reign of Henry the Seventh a commercial treaty had been concluded with Florence, and
the trade with the Mediterranean which began under Richard the Third constantly took a wider
developement. The trade between England and the Baltic ports had hitherto been conducted by
the Hanseatic merchants; but the extinction at this time of their London depot, the Steel Yard,
was a sign that this trade too had now passed into English hands. The growth of Boston and
Hull marked an increase of commercial intercourse with the Scandinavian states. The prosperity
of Bristol, which depended in great measure on the trade with Ireland, was stimulated by the
conquest and colonization of that island at the close of the Queen's reign and the beginning
of her successor's. The dream of a northern passage to India opened up a trade with a land
as yet unknown. Of three ships which sailed in the reign of Mary under Hugh Willoughby to discover
this passage, two were found frozen with their crews and their hapless commander on the coast
of Lapland; but the third, under Richard Chancellor, made its way safely to the White Sea and
by the discovery of Archangel created the trade with Russia. A more lucrative traffic had already
begun with the coast of Guinea, to whose gold dust and ivory the merchants of Southampton owed
their wealth. The guilt of the Slave Trade which sprang out of it rests with John Hawkins.
In 1562 he returned from the African coast with a cargo of negroes; and the arms, whose grant
rewarded this achievement (a demi-moor, proper, bound with a cord), commemorated his priority
in the transport of slaves to the labour-fields of the New World. But the New World was already
furnishing more honest sources of wealth. The voyage of Sebastian Cabot from Bristol to the
mainland of North America had called English vessels to the stormy ocean of the North. From
the time of Henry the Eighth the number of English boats engaged on the cod-banks of Newfoundland
steadily increased, and at the close of Elizabeth's reign the seamen of Biscay found English
rivals in the whale-fishery of the Polar seas.

[Sidenote: General comfort.]

Elizabeth lent a ready patronage to the new commerce, she shared in its speculations, she considered
its extension and protection as a part of public policy, and she sanctioned the formation of
the great Merchant Companies which could alone secure the trader against wrong or injustice
in distant countries. The Merchant-Adventurers of London, a body which had existed long before,
and had received a charter of incorporation under Henry the Seventh, furnished a model for
the Russia Company and the Company which absorbed the new commerce to the Indies. But it was
not wholly with satisfaction that either the Queen or her ministers watched the social change
which wealth was producing around them. They feared the increased expenditure and comfort which
necessarily followed it, as likely to impoverish the land and to eat out the hardihood of the
people. "England spendeth more on wines in one year," complained Cecil, "than it did in ancient
times in four years." In the upper classes the lavishness of a new wealth combined with a lavishness
of life, a love of beauty, of colour, of display, to revolutionize English dress. Men "wore
a manor on their backs." The Queen's three thousand robes were rivalled in their bravery by
the slashed velvets, the ruffs, the jewelled purpoints of the courtiers around her. But signs
of the growing wealth were as evident in the lower class as in the higher. The disuse of salt-fish
and the greater consumption of meat marked the improvement which had taken place among the
country folk. Their rough and wattled farm-houses were being superseded by dwellings of brick
and stone. Pewter was replacing the wooden trenchers of the early yeomanry, and there were
yeomen who could boast of a fair show of silver plate. It is from this period indeed that we
can first date the rise of a conception which seems to us now a peculiarly English one, the
conception of domestic comfort. The chimney-corner, so closely associated with family life,
came into existence with the general introduction of chimneys, a feature rare in ordinary houses
at the beginning of this reign. Pillows, which had before been despised by the farmer and the
trader as fit only "for women in childbed," were now in general use. Carpets superseded the
filthy flooring of rushes. "go of father if it travel me had been the time and are wrong."

 The life of the Middle Ages concentrated itself in the vast castle hall, where
the baron looked from his upper dais on the retainers who gathered at his board. But the great
households were fast breaking up; and the whole feudal economy disappeared when the lord of
the household withdrew with his family into his "parlour" or "withdrawing-room" and left the
hall to his dependants. The Italian refinement of life which told on pleasance and garden told
on the remodelling of the house within, raised the principal apartments to an upper floor--a
change to which we owe the grand staircases of the time--surrounded the quiet courts by long
"galleries of the presence," crowned the rude hearth with huge chimney-pieces adorned with
fauns and cupids, with quaintly-interlaced monograms and fantastic arabesques, hung tapestries
on the walls, and crowded each chamber with quaintly-carved chairs and costly cabinets. The
prodigal use of glass became a marked feature in the domestic architecture of the time, and
one whose influence on the general health of the people can hardly be overrated. Long lines
of windows stretched over the fronts of the new manor halls. Every merchant's house had its
oriel. "You shall have sometimes," Lord Bacon grumbled, "your houses so full of glass, that
we cannot tell where to come to be out of the sun or the cold."

[Sidenote: Elizabeth and English order.]

What Elizabeth contributed to this upgrowth of national prosperity was the peace and social
order from which it sprang. While autos-de-fé were blazing at Rome and Madrid, while the Inquisition
was driving the sober traders of the Netherlands to madness, while Scotland was tossing with
religious strife, while the policy of Catharine secured for France but a brief respite from
the horrors of civil war, England remained untroubled and at peace. Religious order was little
disturbed. Recusants were few. There was little cry as yet for freedom of worship. Freedom
of conscience was the right of every man. Persecution had ceased. It was only as the tale of
a darker past that men recalled how ten years back heretics had been sent to the fire. Civil
order was even more profound than religious order. The failure of the northern revolt proved
the political tranquillity of the country. The social troubles from vagrancy and evictions
were slowly passing away. Taxation was light. The country was firmly and steadily governed.
The popular favour which had met Elizabeth at her accession was growing into a passionate devotion.
Of her faults indeed England beyond the circle of her court knew little or nothing. The shiftings
of her diplomacy were never seen outside the royal closet. The nation at large could only judge
her foreign policy by its main outlines, by its temperance and good sense, and above all by
its success. But every Englishman was able to judge Elizabeth in her rule at home, in her love
of peace, her instinct of order, the firmness and moderation of her government, the judicious
spirit of conciliation and compromise among warring factions which gave the country an unexampled
tranquillity at a time when almost every other country in Europe was torn with civil war. Every
sign of the growing prosperity, the sight of London as it became the mart of the world, of
stately mansions as they rose on every manor, told, and justly told, in the Queen's favour.
Her statue in the centre of the London Exchange was a tribute on the part of the merchant class
to the interest with which she watched and shared personally in its enterprises. Her thrift
won a general gratitude. The memories of the Terror and of the Martyrs threw into bright relief
the aversion from bloodshed which was conspicuous in her earlier reign, and never wholly wanting
through its fiercer close. Above all there was a general confidence in her instinctive knowledge
of the national temper. Her finger was always on the public pulse. She knew exactly when she
could resist the feeling of her people, and when she must give way before the new sentiment
of freedom which her policy unconsciously fostered. But when she retreated, her defeat had
all the grace of victory; and the frankness and unreserve of her surrender won back at once
the love that her resistance lost. Her attitude at home in fact was that of a woman whose pride
in the well-being of her subjects and whose longing for their favour was the one warm touch
in the coldness of her natural temper. If Elizabeth could be said to love anything, she loved
England. "Nothing," she said to her first Parliament in words of unwonted fire, "nothing, no
worldly thing under the sun, is so dear to me as the love and goodwill of my subjects." And
the love and goodwill which were so dear to her she fully won.

[Sidenote: The religious truce.]

It was this personal devotion that enabled Elizabeth to face the religious difficulties of
her reign. Formidable as these had been from its outset, they were now growing into actual
dangers. The attack of the Papacy from without had deepened the tide of religious fanaticism
within. For the nation at large Elizabeth's system was no doubt a wise and healthy one. Single-handed,
unsupported by any of the statesmen or divines about her, the Queen had forced on the warring
religions a sort of armed truce. While the main principles of the Reformation were accepted
the zeal of the ultra-reformers was held at bay. Outer conformity, attendance at the common
prayer, was exacted from all, but changes in ritual which would have drawn attention to the
change in religion were steadily resisted. The Bible was left open. Public discussion was unrestrained.
On the other hand the warfare of pulpit against pulpit was silenced by the licensing of preachers.
In 1576 Elizabeth gave the Protestant zealots a rough proof that she would not suffer them
to draw the Catholics into controversy and rouse the opposition to her system which controversy
could not fail to bring with it. Parker's successor, Archbishop Grindal, who had been one of
the Marian exiles and returned with much of the Calvinistic fanaticism, showed favour to a
"liberty of prophesying" or preaching which would have flooded the realm with Protestant disputants.
Elizabeth at once interposed. The "liberty of prophesying" was brought to an end; even the
number of licensed preachers was curtailed; and the Primate himself was suspended from the
exercise of his functions.

[Sidenote: The religious change.]

No stronger proof could have been given of the Queen's resolve to watch jealously over the
religious peace of her realm. In her earlier years such a resolve went fairly with the general
temper of the people at large. The mass of Englishmen remained true in sentiment to the older
creed. But they conformed to the new worship. They shrank from any open defiance of the government.
They shrank from reawakening the fierce strife of religions, of calling back the horsemen of
Somerset or the fires of Mary. They saw little doctrinal difference between the new prayer
and the old. Above all they trusted to patience. They had seen too many religious revolutions
to believe that any revolution would be lasting. They believed that the changes would be undone
again as they had been undone before. They held that Elizabeth was only acting under pressure,
and that her real inclination was towards the old religion. They trusted in Philip's influence,
in an Austrian marriage, in the Queen's dread of a breach with the Papacy, in the pressure
of Mary Stuart. And meanwhile the years went by, and as the memories of the past became dimmer,
and custom laid a heavier and heavier hand on the mass of men, and a new generation grew up
that had never known the spell of Catholicism, the nation drifted from its older tradition
and became Protestant in its own despite.

[Sidenote: The Puritan pressure.]

It was no doubt a sense that the religious truce was doing their work, as well as a dread of
alienating the Queen and throwing her into the hands of their opponents by a more violent pressure,
which brought the more zealous reformers to acquiesce through Elizabeth's earlier years in
this system of compromise. But it was no sooner denounced by the Papacy than it was attacked
by the Puritans. The rebellion of the Northern Earls, the withdrawal from the public worship,
the Bull of Deposition, roused a fanatical zeal among the Calvinistic party which predominated
in the Parliament of 1571. The movement in favour of a more pronounced Protestantism, of a
more utter break with the Catholic past, which had slowly spread from the knot of exiles who
returned to Geneva, now gathered a new strength; and a bill was brought in for the reform of
the book of Common Prayer by the omission of the practices which displeased the Genevan party
among the clergy. A yet closer approach to the theocratic system of Calvin was seen when the
Lower House refused its assent to a statute that would have bound the clergy to subscribe to
those articles which recognised the royal supremacy, the power of the Church to ordain rites
and ceremonies, and the actual form of Church government. At such a crisis even the weightiest
statesmen at Elizabeth's council-board believed that in the contest with Rome the Crown would
have to rely on Protestant zeal, and the influence of Cecil and Walsingham backed the pressure
of the Parliament. But the Queen was only stirred to a burst of anger; she ordered Strickland,
who had introduced the bill for liturgical reform, to appear no more in Parliament, and though
she withdrew the order as soon as she perceived the House was bent on his restoration, she
would hear nothing of the changes on which the Commons were set.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth's resistance.]

Her resistance showed the sagacity with which the Queen caught the general temper of her people.
The Catholic pressure had made it needful to exclude Catholics from the Commons and from the
council-board, but a Protestant Council and a Protestant Parliament were by no means fair representatives
of the general drift of English opinion. Her religious indifference left Elizabeth a better
judge of the timid and hesitating advance of religious sentiment, of the stubborn clinging
to the past, of the fear of change, of the dread of revolution, which made the winning of the
people as a whole to the Reformation a slow and tedious process. The Protestants were increasing
in number, but they were still a minority of the nation. The zealous Catholics, who withdrew
from church at the Pope's bidding, were a still smaller minority. The bulk of Englishmen were
striving to cling to their religious prejudice and to loyalty as well, to obey their conscience
and their Queen at once, and in such a temper of men's minds any sudden and decisive change
would have fallen like a thunderbolt. Elizabeth had no will to follow in the track of Rome,
and to help the Pope to drive every waverer into action. Weakened and broken as it was, she
clung obstinately to her system of compromise; and the general opinion gave her a strength
which enabled her to resist the pressure of her council and her Parliament. So difficult however
was her position that a change might have been forced on her had she not been aided at this
moment by a group of clerical bigots who gathered under the banner of Presbyterianism.

[Sidenote: Cartwright.]

Of these Thomas Cartwright was the chief. He had studied at Geneva; he returned with a fanatical
faith in Calvinism, and in the system of Church government which Calvin had devised; and as
Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge he used to the full the opportunities which his
chair gave him of propagating his opinions. No leader of a religious party ever deserved less
of after sympathy. Cartwright was unquestionably learned and devout, but his bigotry was that
of a mediæval inquisitor. He were safely it found sometimes is the Achievement, and state but discover

 For heresy there was the punishment of death. Never had the
doctrine of persecution been urged with such a blind and reckless ferocity. "I deny," wrote
Cartwright, "that upon repentance there ought to follow any pardon of death.... Heretics ought
to be put to death now. If this be bloody and extreme, I am content to be so counted with the
Holy Ghost." The violence of language such as this was as unlikely as the dogmatism of his
theological teaching to commend Cartwright's opinions to the mass of Englishmen. Popular as
the Presbyterian system became in Scotland, it never took any popular hold on England. It remained
to the last a clerical rather than a national creed, and even in the moment of its seeming
triumph under the Commonwealth it was rejected by every part of England save London and Lancashire.
But the bold challenge which Cartwright's party delivered to the Government in 1572 in an "admonition
to the Parliament," which denounced the government of bishops as contrary to the word of God
and demanded the establishment in its place of government by Presbyters, raised a panic among
English statesmen and prelates which cut off all hopes of a quiet treatment of the merely ceremonial
questions which really troubled the consciences of the more advanced Protestants. The natural
progress of opinion abruptly ceased, and the moderate thinkers who had pressed for a change
in ritual which would have satisfied the zeal of the reformers withdrew from union with a party
which revived the worst pretensions of the Papacy.

[Sidenote: Revolt of the Netherlands.]

But the eyes of Elizabeth as of her subjects were drawn from difficulties at home to the conflict
which took fresh fire oversea. In Europe, as in England, the tide of religious passion which
had so long been held in check was now breaking over the banks which restrained it; and with
this outbreak of forces before which the diplomacy and intrigues of its statesmen fell powerless
the political face of Europe was changed. In 1572 the power of the king of Spain had reached
its height. The Netherlands were at his feet. In the East his trouble from the pressure of
the Turks seemed brought to an end by a brilliant victory at Lepanto in which his fleet with
those of Venice and the Pope annihilated the fleet of the Sultan. He could throw his whole
weight upon the Calvinism of the West, and above all upon France, where the Guises were fast
sinking into mere partizans of Spain. The common danger drew France and England together; and
Catharine of Medicis strove to bind the two countries in one political action by offering to
Elizabeth the hand of her son Henry, the Duke of Anjou. But at this moment of danger the whole
situation was changed by the rising of the Netherlands. Driven to despair by the greed and
persecution of Alva, the Low Countries rose in a revolt which after strange alternations of
fortune gave to the world the Republic of the United Provinces. Of the Protestants driven out
by the Duke's cruelties, many had taken to the seas and cruised as pirates in the Channel,
making war on Spanish vessels under the flag of the Prince of Orange. Like the Huguenot privateers
who had sailed under Condé's flag, these freebooters found shelter in the English ports. But
in the spring of 1572 Alva demanded their expulsion; and Elizabeth, unable to resist, sent
them orders to put to sea. The Duke's success proved fatal to his master's cause. The "water-beggars,"
a little band of some two hundred and fifty men, were driven by stress of weather into the
Meuse. There they seized the city of Brill, and repulsed a Spanish force which strove to recapture
it. The repulse was the signal for a general rising. All the great cities of Holland and Zealand
drove out their garrisons. The northern Provinces of Gelderland, Overyssel, and Friesland,
followed their example, and by the summer half of the Low Countries were in revolt.

[Sidenote: The massacre of St. Bartholomew.]

A yet greater danger threatened Alva in the south, where Mons had been surprised by Lewis of
Nassau, and where the Calvinists were crying for support from the Huguenots of France. The
opening which their rising afforded was seized by the Huguenot leaders as a political engine
to break the power which Catharine of Medicis exercised over Charles the Ninth, and to set
aside her policy of religious balance by placing France at the head of Protestantism in the
West. Weak and passionate in temper, jealous of the warlike fame which his brother, the Duke
of Anjou, had won at Montcontour, dreading above all the power of Spain and eager to grasp
the opportunity of breaking it by a seizure of the Netherlands, Charles listened to the counsels
of Coligni, who pressed for war upon Philip and promised the support of the Huguenots in an
invasion of the Low Countries. Never had a fairer prospect opened to French ambition. But Catharine
had no mind to be set aside. To her cool political temper the supremacy of the Huguenots seemed
as fatal to the Crown as the supremacy of the Catholics. A triumph of Calvinism in the Netherlands,
wrought out by the swords of the French Calvinists, would decide not only the religious but
the political destinies of France; and Catharine saw ruin for the monarchy in a France at once
Protestant and free. She suddenly united with the Guises and suffered them to rouse the fanatical
mob of Paris, while she won back the king by picturing the royal power as about to pass into
the hands of Coligni. On the twenty-fourth of August, St. Bartholomew's day, the plot broke
out in an awful massacre. At Paris the populace murdered Coligni and almost all the Huguenot
leaders. A hundred thousand Protestants fell as the fury spread from town to town. In that
awful hour Philip and Catholicism were saved. The Spanish king laughed for joy. The new Pope,
Gregory the Thirteenth, ordered a Te Deum to be sung. Instead of conquering the Netherlands
France plunged madly back into a chaos of civil war, and the Low Countries were left to cope
single-handed with the armies of Spain.

[Sidenote: Elizabeth and the Netherlands.]

They could look for no help from Elizabeth. Whatever enthusiasm the heroic struggle of the
Prince of Orange for their liberties excited among her subjects, it failed to move Elizabeth
even for an instant from the path of cold self-interest. To her the revolt of the Netherlands
was simply "a bridle of Spain, which kept war out of our own gate." At the darkest moment of
the contest, when Alva had won back all but Holland and Zealand and even William of Orange
despaired, the Queen bent her energies to prevent him from finding succour in France. That
the Low Countries could in the end withstand Philip, neither she nor any English statesmen
believed. They held that the struggle must close either in their subjection to him, or in their
selling themselves for aid to France; and the accession of power which either result must give
to one of her two Catholic foes the Queen was eager to avert. Her plan for averting it was
by forcing the Provinces to accept the terms which were now offered by Alva's successor, Requesens,
a restoration of their constitutional privileges on condition of their submission to the Church.
Peace on such a footing would not only restore English commerce, which suffered from the war;
it would leave the Netherlands still formidable as a weapon against Philip. The freedom of
the Provinces would be saved; and the religious question involved in a fresh submission to
the yoke of Catholicism was one which Elizabeth was incapable of appreciating. To her the steady
refusal of William the Silent to sacrifice his faith was as unintelligible as the steady bigotry
of Philip in demanding such a sacrifice. It was of more immediate consequence that Philip's
anxiety to avoid provoking an intervention on the part of England left Elizabeth tranquil at
home. The policy of Requesens after Alva's departure at the close of 1573 was a policy of pacification;
and with the steady resistance of the Netherlands still foiling his efforts Philip saw that
his one hope of success rested on the avoidance of intervention from without. The civil war
which followed the massacre of St. Bartholomew removed all danger of such an intervention on
the side of France. A weariness of religious strife enabled Catharine again to return to her
policy of toleration in the summer of 1573; but though the death of Charles the Ninth and accession
of his brother Henry the Third in the following year left the queen-mother's power unbroken,
the balance she preserved was too delicate to leave room for any schemes without the realm.

[Sidenote: England becomes Protestant.]

English intervention it was yet more needful to avoid; and the hopes of an attack upon England
which Rome had drawn from Philip's fanaticism were thus utterly blasted. To the fiery exhortations
of Gregory the Thirteenth the king only answered by counsels of delay. But Rome could not delay
her efforts. All her hopes of recovering England lay in the Catholic sympathies of the mass
of Englishmen, and every year that went by weakened her chance of victory. The firm refusal
of Elizabeth to suffer the Puritans to break in with any violent changes on her ecclesiastical
policy was justified by its slow but steady success. Silently, almost unconsciously, England
became Protestant as the traditionary Catholicism which formed the religion of three-fourths
of the people at the Queen's accession died quietly away. At the close of her reign the only
parts of England where the old faith retained anything of its former vigour were the north
and the extreme west, at that time the poorest and least populated parts of the kingdom. One
main cause of the change lay in the gradual dying out or removal of the Catholic priesthood
and the growth of a new Protestant clergy who supplied their place. The older parish priests,
though they had almost to a man acquiesced in the changes of ritual and doctrine which the
various phases of the Reformation imposed upon them, remained in heart utterly hostile to its
spirit. As Mary had undone the changes of Edward, they hoped for a Catholic successor to undo
the changes of Elizabeth; and in the meantime they were content to wear the surplice instead
of the chasuble, and to use the Communion office instead of the Mass-book. But if they were
forced to read the Homilies from the pulpit the spirit of their teaching remained unchanged;
and it was easy for them to cast contempt on the new services, till they seemed to old-fashioned
worshippers a mere "Christmas game." But the lapse of years did its work in emptying parsonage
after parsonage. In 1579 the Queen felt strong enough to enforce for the first time a general
compliance with the Act of Uniformity; and the jealous supervision of Parker and the bishops
ensured an inner as well as an outer conformity to the established faith in the clergy who
took the place of the dying priesthood. The new parsons were for the most part not merely Protestant
in belief and teaching, but ultra-Protestant. The old restrictions on the use of the pulpit
were silently removed as the need for them passed away, and the zeal of the young ministers
showed itself in an assiduous preaching which moulded in their own fashion the religious ideas
of the new generation. But their character had even a greater influence than their preaching.
Under Henry the priests had in large part been ignorant and sensual men; and the character
of the clergy appointed by the greedy Protestants under Edward or at the opening of Elizabeth's
reign was even worse than that of their Catholic rivals. But the energy of the successive Primates,
seconded as it was by the general increase of zeal and morality at the time, did its work;
and by the close of the Queen's reign the moral temper as well as the social character of the
clergy had greatly changed. Scholars like Hooker could now be found in the ranks of the priesthood,
and the grosser scandals which disgraced the clergy as a body for the most part disappeared.
It was impossible for a Puritan libeller to bring against the ministers of Elizabeth's reign
the charges of drunkenness and immorality which Protestant libellers had been able to bring
against the priesthood of Henry's.

[Sidenote: Patriotism and Protestantism.]

But the influence of the new clergy was backed by a general revolution in English thought.
The grammar schools were diffusing a new knowledge and mental energy through the middle classes
and among the country gentry. The tone of the Universities, no unfair test of the tone of the
nation at large, changed wholly as the Queen's reign went on. At its opening Oxford was "a
nest of Papists" and sent its best scholars to feed the Catholic seminaries. At its close the
University was a hot-bed of Puritanism, where the fiercest tenets of Calvin reigned supreme.
The movement was no doubt hastened by the political circumstances of the time. Under the rule
of Elizabeth loyalty became more and more a passion among Englishmen; and the Bull of Deposition
placed Rome in the forefront of Elizabeth's foes. The conspiracies which festered around Mary
were laid to the Pope's charge; he was known to be pressing on France and on Spain the invasion
and conquest of the heretic kingdom; he was soon to bless the Armada. Every day made it harder
for a Catholic to reconcile Catholicism with loyalty to his Queen or devotion to his country;
and the mass of men, who are moved by sentiment rather than by reason, swung slowly round to
the side which, whatever its religious significance might be, was the side of patriotism, of
liberty against tyranny, of England against Spain. A new impulse was given to this silent drift
of religious opinion by the atrocities which marked the Catholic triumph on the other side
of the Channel. The horror of Alva's butcheries or of the massacre in Paris on St. Bartholomew's
day revived the memories of the bloodshed under Mary. The tale of Protestant sufferings was
told with a wonderful pathos and picturesqueness by John Foxe, an exile during the persecution;
and his "Book of Martyrs," which was set up by royal order in the churches for public reading,
passed from the churches to the shelves of every English household. The trading classes of
the towns had been the first to embrace the doctrines of the Reformation, but their Protestantism
became a passion as the refugees of the Continent brought to shop and market their tale of
outrage and blood. Thousands of Flemish exiles found a refuge in the Cinque Ports, a third
of the Antwerp merchants were seen pacing the new London Exchange, and a Church of French Huguenots
found a home which it still retains in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral.

[Sidenote: The Seminary Priests.]

But the decay of Catholicism appealed strongly to the new spirit of Catholic zeal which, in
its despair of aid from Catholic princes, was girding itself for its own bitter struggle with
heresy. Pius the Fifth had now passed away, but the policy of the Papal court remained unchanged.
His successor, Gregory the Thirteenth, showed the same restless zeal, the same world-wide energy
in the work of winning back the nations to the Catholic Church. Rome was still the centre of
the Catholic crusade. It wielded material as well as spiritual arms. If the Papacy had ceased
to be a military power, it remained a financial power. Taxes were multiplied, expenses reduced,
estates confiscated, free towns reduced to servitude, with the one aim of enabling Gregory
and his successors to build up a vast system of loans which poured the wealth of Europe into
the treasury of Catholicism. It was the treasure of the Vatican which financed the Catholic
movement. Subsidies from the Papacy fitted out the fleet that faced the Turk at Lepanto, and
gathered round the Guises their lance-knights from the Rhine. Papal supplies equipped expeditions
against Ireland, and helped Philip to bear the cost of the Armada. It was the Papal exchequer
which supported the world-wide diplomacy that was carrying on negotiations in Sweden and intrigues
in Poland, goading the lukewarm Emperor to action or quickening the sluggish movements of Spain,
plotting the ruin of Geneva or the assassination of Orange, stirring up revolt in England and
civil war in France. It was the Papacy that bore the cost of the religious propaganda that
was fighting its stubborn battle with Calvinist and Lutheran on the Rhine and the Elbe, or
sending its missionaries to win back the lost isle of the west. As early as 1568 Dr. Allen,
a scholar who had been driven from Oxford by the test prescribed in the Act of Uniformity,
had foreseen the results of the dying out of the Marian priests, and had set up a seminary
at Douay to supply their place. The new college was liberally supported by the Catholic peers,
and supplied with pupils by a stream of refugees from Oxford and the English grammar schools.
Three years after its opening the college numbered a hundred and fifty members. It was in these
"seminary priests" that Gregory the Thirteenth saw the means of reviving Catholic zeal in England,
and at the Pope's bidding they began in 1576 to pass over to English shores.

[Sidenote: The English Panic.]

Few as the new-comers were at first, their presence was at once felt in the check which it
gave to the gradual reconciliation of the Catholic gentry to the English Church. No check could
have been more galling to Elizabeth, and her resentment was quickened by the sense of danger.
Rome had set itself in the forefront of her foes. She had accepted the issue of the Bull of
Deposition as a declaration of war on the part of the Papacy, and she viewed the Douay priests
with some justice as its political emissaries. The comparative security of the Catholics from
active persecution during the early part of her reign had arisen, partly from the sympathy
and connivance of the gentry who acted as justices of the peace, and still more from her own
religious indifference. But the Test Act placed the magistracy in Protestant hands; and as
Elizabeth passed from indifference to suspicion and from suspicion to terror she put less restraint
on the bigotry around her. In quitting Euston Hall which she had visited in one of her pilgrimages
the Queen gave its master, young Rookwood, thanks for his entertainment and her hand to kiss.
The Council's pleasure was seen in his committal to the town prison at Norwich, while "seven
more gentlemen of worship" were fortunate enough to escape with a simple sentence of arrest
at their own homes. The Queen's terror became a panic in the nation at large. The few priests
who landed from Douay were multiplied into an army of Papal emissaries despatched to sow treason
and revolt throughout the land. Parliament, which the working of the Test Act had made a wholly
Protestant body, save for the presence of a few Catholics among the peers, was summoned to
meet the new danger, and declared by formal statute the landing of these priests and the harbouring
of them to be treason. The Act proved no idle menace; and the execution of Cuthbert Mayne,
a young priest who was arrested in Cornwall with the Papal Bull of Deposition hidden about
him, gave a terrible indication of the character of the struggle upon which Elizabeth was about
to enter.

[Sidenote: Don John of Austria.]

The execution of Cuthbert Mayne was far from being purposed as the opening of a religious persecution.
To modern eyes there is something even more revolting than open persecution in a policy which
branded every Catholic priest as a traitor and all Catholic worship as disloyalty; but the
first step towards toleration was won when the Queen rested her system of repression on purely
political grounds. If Elizabeth was a persecutor, she was the first English ruler who felt
the charge of religious persecution to be a stigma on her rule. Nor can it be denied that there
was a real political danger in the new missionaries. Allen was a restless conspirator, and
the work of his seminary priests was meant to aid a new plan of the Papacy for the conquest
of England. In 1576, on the death of Requesens, the Spanish governor of the Low Countries,
a successor was found for him in Don John of Austria, a natural brother of Philip, the victor
of Lepanto, and the most famous general of his day. The temper of Don John was daring and ambitious;
his aim was a crown; and he sought in the Netherlands the means of winning one. His ambition
lent itself easily to the schemes of Mary Stuart and of Rome; and he resolved to bring about
by quick concessions a settlement in the Low Countries, to cross with the Spanish forces employed
there to England, to raise the Catholics in revolt, to free and marry Mary Stuart, and reign
in her right as an English king. The plan was an able one; but it was foiled ere he reached
his post. The Spanish troops had mutinied on the death of Requesens; and their sack of Antwerp
drew the States of the Netherlands together in a "Pacification of Ghent." All differences of
religion were set aside in a common purpose to drive out the stranger. Baffled as he was, the
subtlety of Don John turned even this league to account. Their demand for the withdrawal of
the Spanish troops, though fatal to Philip's interests in the Low Countries, could be made
to serve the interests of Don John across the seas. In February 1577, therefore, he ratified
the Pacification of Ghent, consented to the maintenance of the liberties of the States, and
engaged to withdraw the army. He stipulated only for its withdrawal by sea, and for a delay
of three months, which was needful for the arrangement of his descent on the English coast.
Both demands however were refused; he was forced to withdraw his troops at once and by land,
and the scheme of the Papacy found itself utterly foiled.

[Sidenote: The Prince of Parma.]

Secret as were the plans of Don John, Elizabeth had seen how near danger had drawn to her.
Fortune once more proved her friend, for the efforts of Don John to bring about a reconciliation
of the Netherlands proved fruitless, and negotiations soon passed again into the clash of arms.
But the Queen was warned at last. On the new outbreak of war in 1577 she allied herself with
the States and sent them money and men. Such a step, though not in form an act of hostility
against Philip, for the Provinces with which she leagued herself still owned themselves as
Philip's subjects, was a measure which proved the Queen's sense of her need of the Netherlands.
Though she had little sympathy with their effort for freedom, she saw in them "the one bridle
to Spain to keep war out of our own gate." But she was to see the war drift nearer and nearer
to her shores. Now that the Netherlands were all but lost Philip's slow stubborn temper strung
itself to meet the greatness of the peril. The Spanish army was reinforced; and in January
1578 it routed the army of the States on the field of Gemblours. The sickness and death of
Don John arrested its progress for a few months; but his successor, Philip's nephew, Alexander
Farnese, the Prince of Parma, soon proved his greatness whether as a statesman or a general.
He seized on the difference of faith between the Catholic and Protestant States as a means
of division. The Pacification of Ghent was broken at the opening of 1579 by the secession of
the Walloon provinces of the southern border. It was only by a new league of the seven northern
provinces, where Protestantism was dominant, in the Union of Utrecht that William of Orange
could meet Parma's stroke. But the general union of the Low Countries was fatally broken, and
from this moment the ten Catholic states passed one by one into the hands of Spain.

[Sidenote: The Papal attack.]

The new vigour of Philip in the West marked a change in the whole policy of Spain. Till now,
in spite of endless provocations, Philip had clung to the English alliance. Fear of Elizabeth's
union with France, dread of her help to the Netherlands, had steeled him to bear patiently
her defiance of his counsels, her neglect of his threats, her seizure of his treasure, her
persecution of the Catholic party which looked to him as its head. But patience had only been
met by fresh attacks. The attempt of Don John had spurred Elizabeth to ally herself to France.
She was expected every hour to marry the Duke of Anjou. She had given friendship and aid to
the revolted provinces. Above all her freebooters were carrying war into the far Pacific, and
challenging the right of Spain to the New World of the West. Philip drifted whether he would
or no into a position of hostility. He had not forbidden the projects of Don John; he at last
promised aid to the projects of Rome. In 1579 the Papacy planned the greatest and most comprehensive
of its attacks upon Elizabeth. If the Catholic powers still hesitated and delayed, Rome was
resolute to try its own strength in the West. The spiritual reconciliation of England was not
enough. However successful the efforts of the seminary priests might prove they would leave
Elizabeth on the throne, and the reign of Elizabeth was a defeat to the Papacy. In issuing
its Bull of Deposition Rome had staked all on the ruin of the Queen, and even if England became
Catholic Gregory could not suffer his spiritual subjects to obey a ruler whom his sentence
had declared an unlawful possessor of the throne. And now that the temper of Spain promised
more vigorous action Rome could pave the way for a landing of Philip's troops by stirring up
a threefold danger for Elizabeth. While fresh and more vigorous missionaries egged on the English
Catholics to revolt, the Pope hastened to bring about a Catholic revolution in Scotland and
a Catholic insurrection in Ireland.

[Sidenote: Ireland.]

In Ireland Sidney's victory had been followed by ten years of peace. Had the land been left
to itself there would have been nothing more than the common feuds and disturbances of the
time. The policy of driving its people to despair by seizing their lands for English settlements
had been abandoned since Mary's day. The religious question had hardly any practical existence.
On the Queen's accession indeed the ecclesiastical policy of the Protestants had been revived
in name; Rome was again renounced; the Act of Uniformity forced on the island the use of the
English Prayer-Book and compelled attendances at the services where it was used. There was
as before a general air of compliance with the law. Even in the districts without the Pale
the bishops generally conformed; and the only exceptions of which we have any information were
to be found in the extreme south and in the north, where resistance was distant enough to be
safe. But the real cause of this apparent submission to the Act of Uniformity lay in the fact
that it remained, and necessarily remained, a dead letter. It was impossible to find any considerable
number of English ministers, or of Irish priests acquainted with English. Meath was one of
the most civilized dioceses of the island, and out of a hundred curates in it hardly ten knew
any tongue save their own. The promise that the service-book should be translated into Irish
was never carried out, and the final clause of the Act itself authorized the use of a Latin
rendering of it till further order could be taken. But this, like its other provisions, was
ignored; and throughout Elizabeth's reign the gentry of the Pale went unquestioned to Mass.
There was in fact no religious persecution, and in the many complaints of Shane O'Neill we
find no mention of a religious grievance.

[Sidenote: Ireland and the Papacy.]

But this was far from being the view of Rome or of Spain, of the Catholic missionaries, or
of the Irish exiles abroad. They represented and perhaps believed the Irish people to be writhing
under a religious oppression which it was burning to shake off. They saw in the Irish loyalty
to Catholicism a lever for overthrowing the heretic Queen. Stukely, an Irish refugee, had pressed
on the Pope and Spain as early as 1571 the policy of a descent on Ireland; and though a force
gathered in 1578 by the Pope for this purpose was diverted to a mad crusade against the Moors,
his plans were carried out in 1579 by the landing of a few soldiers under the brother of the
Earl of Desmond, James Fitzmaurice, on the coast of Kerry. The Irish however held aloof, and
Fitzmaurice fell in a skirmish; but the revolt of the Earl of Desmond gave fresh hope of success,
and the rising was backed by the arrival in 1580 of two thousand Papal soldiers "in five great
ships." These mercenaries were headed by an Italian captain, San Giuseppe, and accompanied
by a Papal Legate, the Jesuit Sanders, who brought plenary indulgence for all who joined the
sacred enterprise and threats of damnation for all who resisted it. "What will you answer to
the Pope's treatment," ran his letter to the Irish, "when he, bringing us the Pope's and other
Catholic princes' aid, shall charge you with the crime and pain of heretics for maintaining
an heretical pretensed Queen against the public sentence of Christ's vicar? Can she with her
feigned supremacy absolve and acquit you from the Pope's excommunication and curse?" The news
of the landing of this force stirred in England a Protestant frenzy that foiled the scheme
for a Catholic marriage with the Duke of Anjou; while Elizabeth, panic-stricken, urged the
French king to save her from Philip by an invasion of the Netherlands. But the danger passed
quickly away. The Papal attempt ended in a miserable failure. The fort of Smerwick, in which
the invaders entrenched themselves, was forced to surrender, and its garrison put ruthlessly
to the sword. The Earl of Desmond, who after long indecision rose to support them, was defeated
and hunted over his own country, which the panic-born cruelty of his pursuers harried into
a wilderness.

[Sidenote: The Jesuit landing.]

Pitiless as it was, the work done in Munster spread a terror over Ireland which served England
in good stead when the struggle of Catholicism culminated in the fight with the Armada; and
not a chieftain stirred during that memorable year save to massacre the miserable men who were
shipwrecked along the coast of Bantry or Sligo. But the Irish revolt did much to give fresh
strength to the panic which the efforts of the seminary priests had roused in England. This
was raised to frenzy by news that to the efforts of the seminary priests were now added those
of Jesuit missionaries. Pope Gregory had resolved to support his military effort in Ireland
by a fresh missionary effort in England itself. Philip would only promise to invade England
if the co-operation of its Catholics was secured; and the aim of the new mission was to prepare
them for revolt. While the force of San Giuseppe was being equipped for Kerry a young convert,
William Gilbert, was despatched to form a Catholic association in England; among whose members
the chief were afterwards found engaged in conspiracies for the death of Elizabeth or sharing
in the Gunpowder Plot. As soon as this was organized, as many as fifty priests, if we may trust
Allen's statement, were sent to land secretly on the coast. They were headed by two men of
remarkable talents and energy. A large number of the Oxford refugees at Douay had joined the
Order of Jesus, whose members were already famous for their blind devotion to the will and
judgements of Rome; and the two ablest and most eloquent of these exiles, Campian, once a fellow
of St. John's, and Parsons, once a fellow of Balliol, were despatched in the spring of 1580
as the heads of a Jesuit mission in England. Their special aim was to win the nobility and
gentry to the Church, and for the moment their success seemed overwhelming. "It is supposed,"
wrote Allen triumphantly, "that there are twenty thousand more Catholics this year than last."
The eagerness shown to hear Campian was so great that in spite of the rewards offered for his
arrest by the Government he was able to preach with hardly a show of concealment to a large
audience at Smithfield. From London the Jesuits wandered in the disguise of captains or serving-men,
sometimes even in the cassocks of the English clergy, through many of the counties; and wherever
they went the zeal of the Catholic gentry revived. The list of nobles won back to the older
faith by these wandering apostles was headed by the name of Lord Oxford, Cecil's own son-in-law,
and the proudest among English peers.

[Sidenote: The Protestant terror.]

Their success in undoing the Queen's work of compromise was shown in a more public way by the
growing withdrawal of the Catholics from attendance at the worship of the English Church. It
was plain that a fierce religious struggle was at hand, and men felt that behind this lay a
yet fiercer political struggle. Philip's hosts were looming over sea, and the horrors of foreign
invasion seemed about to be added to the horrors of civil war. The panic of the Protestants
and of the Parliament outran even the real greatness of the danger. The little group of missionaries
was magnified by popular fancy into a host of disguised Jesuits; and the invasion of this imaginary
host was met by the seizure and torture of as many priests as the government could lay hands
on, the imprisonment of recusants, the securing of the prominent Catholics throughout the country,
and by the assembling of Parliament at the opening of 1581. An Act "to retain the Queen's Majesty's
subjects in due obedience" prohibited the saying of Mass even in private houses, increased
the fine on recusants to twenty pounds a month, and enacted that "all persons pretending to
any power of absolving subjects from their allegiance, or practising to withdraw them to the
Romish religion, with all persons after the present session willingly so absolved or reconciled
to the See of Rome, shall be guilty of High Treason." The way in which the vast powers conferred
on the Crown by this statute were used by Elizabeth was not only characteristic in itself,
but important as at once defining the policy to which, in theory at least, her successors adhered
for more than a hundred years. No layman was brought to the bar or to the block under its provisions.
The oppression of the Catholic gentry was limited to an exaction, more or less rigorous at
different times, of the fines for recusancy or non-attendance at public worship. The work of
bloodshed was reserved wholly for priests, and under Elizabeth this work was done with a ruthless
energy which for the moment crushed the Catholic reaction. The Jesuits were tracked by pursuivants
and spies, dragged from their hiding-places, and sent in batches to the Tower. So hot was the
pursuit that Parsons was forced to fly across the Channel; while Campian was arrested in July
1581, brought a prisoner through the streets of London amidst the howling of the mob, and placed
at the bar on the charge of treason. "Our religion only is our crime," was a plea which galled
his judges; but the political danger of the Jesuit preaching was disclosed in his evasion of
any direct reply when questioned as to his belief in the validity of the excommunication or
deposition of the Queen by the Papal See, and after much hesitation he was executed as a traitor.

[Sidenote: The Catholic resistance.]

Rome was now at open war with England. Even the more conservative Englishmen looked on the
Papacy as the first among England's foes. In striving to enforce the claims of its temporal
supremacy, Rome had roused against it that national pride which had battled with it even in
the middle ages. From that hour therefore the cause of Catholicism was lost. England became
Protestant in heart and soul when Protestantism became identified with patriotism. But it was
not to Protestantism only that this attitude of Rome and the policy it forced on the Government
gave a new impulse. The death of Campian was the prelude to a steady, pitiless effort at the
extermination of his class. If we adopt the Catholic estimate of the time, the twenty years
which followed saw the execution of two hundred priests, while a yet greater number perished
in the filthy and fever-stricken gaols into which they were plunged. The work of reconciliation
to Rome was arrested by this ruthless energy; but, on the other hand, the work which the priests
had effected could not be undone. The system of quiet compulsion and conciliation to which
Elizabeth had trusted for the religious reunion of her subjects was foiled; and the English
Catholics, fined, imprisoned at every crisis of national danger, and deprived of their teachers
by the prison and the gibbet, were severed more hopelessly than ever from the national Church.
A fresh impulse was thus given to the growing current of opinion which was to bring England
at last to recognize the right of every man to freedom both of conscience and of worship. "In
Henry's days, the father of this Elizabeth," wrote a Catholic priest at this time, "the whole
kingdom with all its bishops and learned men abjured their faith at one word of the tyrant.
But now in his daughter's days boys and women boldly profess the faith before the judge, and
refuse to make the slightest concession even at the threat of death." What Protestantism had
first done under Mary, Catholicism was doing under Elizabeth. It was deepening the sense of
personal religion. It was revealing in men who had till now cowered before the might of kingship
a power greater than the might of kings. It was breaking the spell which the monarchy had laid
on the imagination of the people. The Crown ceased to seem irresistible when "boys and women"
dared to resist it: it lost its mysterious sacredness when half the nation looked on their
sovereign as a heretic. The "divinity that doth hedge a king" was rudely broken in upon when
Jesuit libellers were able to brand the wearer of the crown not only as a usurper but as a
profligate and abandoned woman. The mighty impulse of patriotism, of national pride, which
rallied the whole people round Elizabeth as the Armada threatened England or Drake threatened
Spain, shielded indeed Elizabeth from much of the natural results of this drift of opinion.
But with her death the new sentiment started suddenly to the front. The divine right of kings,
the divine right of bishops, found themselves face to face with a passion for religious and
political liberty which had gained vigour from the dungeon of the Catholic priest as from that
of the Protestant zealot.

CHAPTER VI

ENGLAND AND SPAIN

1582-1593

[Sidenote: The popular passion.]

The work of the Jesuits, the withdrawal of the Catholics from the churches, the panic of the
Protestants, were signs that the control of events was passing from the hands of statesmen
and diplomatists, and that the long period of suspense which Elizabeth's policy had won was
ending in the clash of national and political passions. The rising fanaticism of the Catholic
world was breaking down the caution and hesitation of Philip; while England was setting aside
the balanced neutrality of her Queen and pushing boldly forward to a contest which it felt
to be inevitable. The public opinion, to which Elizabeth was so sensitive, took every day a
bolder and more decided tone. Her cold indifference to the heroic struggle in Flanders was
more than compensated by the enthusiasm it roused among the nation at large. The earlier Flemish
refugees found a home in the Cinque Ports. The exiled merchants of Antwerp were welcomed by
the merchants of London. While Elizabeth dribbled out her secret aid to the Prince of Orange,
the London traders sent him half-a-million from their own purses, a sum equal to a year's revenue
of the Crown. Volunteers stole across the Channel in increasing numbers to the aid of the Dutch,
till the five hundred Englishmen who fought in the beginning of the struggle rose to a brigade
of five thousand, whose bravery turned one of the most critical battles of the war. Dutch privateers
found shelter in English ports, and English vessels hoisted the flag of the States for a dash
at the Spanish traders. Protestant fervour rose steadily among Englishmen as "the best captains
and soldiers" returned from the campaigns in the Low Countries to tell of Alva's atrocities,
or as privateers brought back tales of English seamen who had been seized in Spain and the
New World, to linger amidst the tortures of the Inquisition, or to die in its fires. In the
presence of this steady drift of popular passion the diplomacy of Elizabeth became of little
moment. If the Queen was resolute for peace, England was resolute for war. A new daring had
arisen since the beginning of her reign, when Cecil and Elizabeth stood alone in their belief
in England's strength, and when the diplomatists of Europe regarded her obstinate defiance
of Philip's counsels as "madness." The whole English people had caught the self-confidence
and daring of their Queen.

[Sidenote: Spain.]

It was the instinct of liberty as well as of Protestantism that drove England forward to a
conflict with Philip of Spain. Spain was at this moment the mightiest of European powers. The
discoveries of Columbus had given it the New World of the West; the conquests of Cortes and
Pizarro poured into its treasury the plunder of Mexico and Peru; its galleons brought the rich
produce of the Indies, their gold, their jewels, their ingots of silver, to the harbour of
Cadiz. To the New World the Spanish king added the fairest and wealthiest portions of the Old;
he was master of Naples and Milan, the richest and most fertile districts of Italy; in spite
of revolt he was still lord of the busy provinces of the Low Countries, of Flanders, the great
manufacturing district of the time, and of Antwerp, which had become the central mart for the
commerce of the world. His native kingdom, poor as it was, supplied him with the steadiest
and the most daring soldiers that Europe had seen since the fall of the Roman Empire. The renown
of the Spanish infantry had been growing from the day when it flung off the onset of the French
chivalry on the field of Ravenna; and the Spanish generals stood without rivals in their military
skill, as they stood without rivals in their ruthless cruelty.

[Sidenote: Philip.]

The whole too of this enormous power was massed in the hands of a single man. Served as he
was by able statesmen and subtle diplomatists, Philip of Spain was his own sole minister; labouring
day after day, like a clerk, through the long years of his reign, amidst the papers which crowded
his closet; but resolute to let nothing pass without his supervision, and to suffer nothing
to be done save by his express command. His scheme of rule differed widely from that of his
father. Charles had held the vast mass of his dominions by a purely personal bond. He chose
no capital, but moved ceaselessly from land to land; he was a German in the Empire, a Spaniard
in Castille, a Netherlander in the Netherlands. But in the hands of Philip his father's heritage
became a Spanish realm. His capital was fixed at Madrid. The rest of his dominions sank into
provinces of Spain, to be governed by Spanish viceroys, and subordinated to the policy and
interests of a Spanish minister. All local liberties, all varieties of administration, all
national differences were set aside for a monotonous despotism which was wielded by Philip
himself. It was his boast that everywhere in the vast compass of his dominions he was "an absolute
king." It was to realize this idea of unshackled power that he crushed the liberties of Aragon,
as his father had crushed the liberties of Castille, and sent Alva to tread under foot the
constitutional freedom of the Low Countries. His bigotry went hand in hand with his thirst
for rule. Catholicism was the one common bond that knit his realms together, and policy as
well as religious faith made Philip the champion of Catholicism. Italy and Spain lay hushed
beneath the terror of the Inquisition, while Flanders was being purged of heresy by the stake
and the sword.

[Sidenote: Philip and Elizabeth.]

The shadow of this gigantic power fell like a deadly blight over Europe. The new Protestantism,
like the new spirit of political liberty, saw its real foe in Philip. It was Spain, rather
than the Guises, against which Coligni and the Huguenots struggled in vain; it was Spain with
which William of Orange was wrestling for religious and civil freedom; it was Spain which was
soon to plunge Germany into the chaos of the Thirty Years War, and to which the Catholic world
had for twenty years been looking, and looking in vain, for a victory over heresy in England.
Vast in fact as Philip's resources were, they were drained by the yet vaster schemes of ambition
into which his religion and his greed of power, as well as the wide distribution of his dominions,
perpetually drew him. To coerce the weaker States of Italy, to command the Mediterranean, to
keep a hold on the African coast, to preserve his influence in Germany, to support Catholicism
in France, to crush heresy in Flanders, to despatch one Armada against the Turk and another
against England, were aims mighty enough to exhaust even the power of the Spanish monarchy.
But it was rather on the character of Philip than on the exhaustion of his treasury that Elizabeth
counted for success in the struggle which had so long been going on between them. The king's
temper was slow, cautious even to timidity, losing itself continually in delays, in hesitations,
in anticipating remote perils, in waiting for distant chances; and on the slowness and hesitation
of his temper his rival had been playing ever since she mounted the throne. The agility, the
sudden changes of Elizabeth, her lies, her mystifications, though they failed to deceive Philip,
puzzled and impeded his mind. The diplomatic contest between the two was like the fight which
England was soon to see between the ponderous Spanish galleon and the light pinnace of the
buccaneers.

[Sidenote: Philip's policy.]

But amidst all the cloud of intrigue which disguised their policy, the actual course of their
relations had been clear and simple. In the earlier years of Elizabeth Philip had been driven
to her alliance by his fear of France and his dread of the establishment of a French supremacy
over England and Scotland through the accession of Mary Stuart. As time went on, the discontent
and rising of the Netherlands made it of hardly less import to avoid a strife with the Queen.
Had revolt in England prospered, or Mary Stuart succeeded in her countless plots, or Elizabeth
fallen beneath an assassin's knife, Philip was ready to have struck in and reaped the fruits
of other men's labours. But his stake was too vast to risk an attack while the Queen sat firmly
on her throne; and the cry of the English Catholics, or the pressure of the Pope, failed to
drive the Spanish king into strife with Elizabeth. But as the tide of religious passion which
had so long been held in check broke over its banks the political face of Europe changed. Philip
had less to dread from France or from an English alliance with France. The abstinence of Elizabeth
from intervention in the Netherlands was neutralized by the intervention of the English people.
Above all, the English hostility threatened Philip in a quarter where he was more sensitive
than elsewhere, his dominion in the West.

[Sidenote: Spain and the New World.]

Foiled as the ambition of Charles the Fifth had been in the Old World, his empire had widened
with every year in the New. At his accession to the throne the Spanish rule had hardly spread
beyond the Island of St. Domingo, which Columbus had discovered twenty years before. But greed
and enterprise drew Cortes to the mainland, and in 1521 his conquest of Mexico added a realm
of gold to the dominions of the Emperor. Ten years later the great empire of Peru yielded to
the arms of Pizarro. With the conquest of Chili the whole western coast of South America passed
into the hands of Spain; and successive expeditions planted the Spanish flag at point upon
point along the coast of the Atlantic from Florida to the river Plate. A Papal grant had conveyed
the whole of America to the Spanish crown, and fortune seemed for long years to ratify the
judgement of the Vatican. No European nation save Portugal disputed the possession of the New
World, and Portugal was too busy with its discoveries in Africa and India to claim more than
the territory of Brazil. Though Francis the First sent seamen to explore the American coast,
his ambition found other work at home; and a Huguenot colony which settled in Florida was cut
to pieces by the Spaniards. Only in the far north did a few French settlers find rest beside
the waters of the St. Lawrence. England had reached the mainland even earlier than Spain, for
before Columbus touched its shores Sebastian Cabot, a seaman of Genoese blood but born and
bred in England, sailed with an English crew from Bristol in 1497, and pushed along the coast
of America to the south as far as Florida, and northward as high as Hudson's Bay. But no Englishman
followed on the track of this bold adventurer; and while Spain built up her empire in the New
World, the English seamen reaped a humbler harvest in the fisheries of Newfoundland.

[Sidenote: The Sea-dogs.]

There was little therefore in the circumstances which attended the first discovery of the western
continent that promised well for freedom. Its one result as yet was to give an enormous impulse
to the most bigoted and tyrannical among the powers of Europe, and to pour the gold of Mexico
and Peru into the treasury of Spain. But as the reign of Elizabeth went on the thoughts of
Englishmen turned again to the New World. A happy instinct drew them from the first not to
the southern shores that Spain was conquering, but to the ruder and more barren districts of
the north. In 1576 the dream of finding a passage to Asia by a voyage round the northern coast
of the American continent drew a west-country seaman, Martin Frobisher, to the coast of Labrador;
and, foiled as he was in his quest, the news he brought back of the existence of gold mines
there set adventurers cruising among the icebergs of Baffin's Bay. Elizabeth herself joined
in the venture; but the settlement proved a failure, the ore which the ships brought back turned
out to be worthless, and England was saved from that greed of gold which was to be fatal to
the energies of Spain. But, failure as it was, Frobisher's venture had shown the readiness
of Englishmen to defy the claims of Spain to the exclusive possession of America or the American
seas. They were already defying these claims in a yet more galling way. The seamen of the southern
and south-western coasts had long been carrying on a half-piratical war on their own account.
Four years after Elizabeth's accession the Channel swarmed with "sea-dogs," as they were called,
who sailed under letters of marque from Condé and the Huguenot leaders, and took heed neither
of the complaints of the French Court nor of their own Queen's efforts at repression. Her efforts
broke against the connivance of every man along the coast, of the very port officers of the
Crown, who made profit out of the spoil which the plunderers brought home, and of the gentry
of the west, whose love of venture made them go hand in hand with the sea-dogs. They broke
above all against the national craving for open fight with Spain, and the Protestant craving
for open fight with Catholicism. If the Queen held back from any formal part in the great war
of religions across the Channel, her subjects were keen to take their part in it. Young Englishmen
crossed the sea to serve under Condé or Henry of Navarre. The war in the Netherlands drew hundreds
of Protestants to the field. Their passionate longing for a religious war found a wider sphere
on the sea. When the suspension of the French contest forced the sea-dogs to haul down the
Huguenot flag, they joined in the cruises of the Dutch "sea-beggars." From plundering the vessels
of Havre and Rochelle they turned to plunder the galleons of Spain.

[Sidenote: Drake.]

Their outrages tried Philip's patience; but his slow resentment only quickened into angry alarm
when the sea-dogs sailed westward to seek a richer spoil. The Papal decree which gave the New
World to Spain, the threats of the Spanish king against any Protestant who should visit its
seas, fell idly on the ears of English seamen. Philip's care to save his new dominions from
the touch of heresy was only equalled by his resolve to suffer no trade between them and other
lands than Spain. But the sea-dogs were as ready to traffic as to fight. It was in vain that
their vessels were seized, and the sailors flung into the dungeons of the Inquisition, "laden
with irons, without sight of sun or moon." The profits of the trade were large enough to counteract
its perils; and the bigotry of Philip was met by a bigotry as merciless as his own. The Puritanism
of the sea-dogs went hand in hand with their love of adventure. To break through the Catholic
monopoly of the New World, to kill Spaniards, to sell negroes, to sack gold-ships, were in
these men's minds a seemly work for "the elect of God." The name of Francis Drake became the
terror of the Spanish Indies. In Drake a Protestant fanaticism went hand in hand with a splendid
daring. He conceived the design of penetrating into the Pacific, whose waters had till then
never seen an English flag; and backed by a little company of adventurers, he set sail in 1577
for the southern seas in a vessel hardly as big as a Channel schooner, with a few yet smaller
companions who fell away before the storms and perils of the voyage. But Drake with his one
ship and eighty men held boldly on; and passing the Straits of Magellan, untraversed as yet
by any Englishman, swept the unguarded coast of Chili and Peru, loaded his bark with the gold
dust and silver ingots of Potosi, as well as with the pearls, emeralds, and diamonds which
formed the cargo of the great galleon that sailed once a year from Lima to Cadiz. With spoils
of above half-a-million in value the daring adventurer steered undauntedly for the Moluccas,
rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and in 1580, after completing the circuit of the globe, dropped
anchor again in Plymouth harbour.

[Sidenote: Conquest of Portugal.]

The romantic daring of Drake's voyage as well as the vastness of his spoil roused a general
enthusiasm throughout England. But the welcome which he received from Elizabeth on his return
was accepted by Philip as an outrage which could only be expiated by war. Sluggish as it was,
the blood of the Spanish king was fired at last by the defiance with which the Queen listened
to all demands for redress. She met a request for Drake's surrender by knighting the freebooter
and by wearing in her crown the jewels he offered her as a present. When the Spanish ambassador
threatened that "matters would come to the cannon," she replied "quietly, in her most natural
voice, as if she were telling a common story," wrote Mendoza, "that if I used threats of that
kind she would fling me into a dungeon." Outraged indeed as Philip was, she believed that with
the Netherlands still in revolt and France longing for her alliance to enable it to seize them,
the king could not afford to quarrel with her. But the victories and diplomacy of Parma were
already reassuring Philip in the Netherlands; while the alliance of Elizabeth with the revolted
Provinces convinced him at last that their reduction could best be brought about by an invasion
of England and the establishment of Mary Stuart on its throne. With this conviction he lent
himself to the plans of Rome, and waited only for the rising in Ireland and the revolt of the
English Catholics which Pope Gregory promised him to despatch forces from both Flanders and
Spain. But the Irish rising was over before Philip could act; and before the Jesuits could
rouse England to rebellion the Spanish king himself was drawn to a new scheme of ambition by
the death of King Sebastian of Portugal in 1580. Philip claimed the Portuguese crown; and in
less than two months Alva laid the kingdom at his feet. The conquest of Portugal was fatal
to the Papal projects against England, for while the armies of Spain marched on Lisbon Elizabeth
was able to throw the leaders of the expected revolt into prison and to send Campian to the
scaffold. On the other hand it raised Philip into a far more formidable foe. The conquest almost
doubled his power. His gain was far more than that of Portugal itself. While Spain had been
winning the New World her sister-kingdom had been winning a wide though scattered dominion
on the African coast, the coast of India, and the islands of the Pacific. Less in extent, the
Portuguese settlements were at the moment of even greater value to the mother country than
the colonies of Spain. The gold of Guinea, the silks of Goa, the spices of the Philippines
made Lisbon one of the marts of Europe. The sword of Alva had given Philip a hold on the richest
trade of the world. It had given him the one navy that as yet rivalled his own. His flag claimed
mastery in the Indian and the Pacific seas, as it claimed mastery in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.

[Sidenote: The marriage with Anjou.]

The conquest of Portugal therefore wholly changed Philip's position. It not only doubled his
power and resources, but it did this at a time when fortune seemed everywhere wavering to his
side. The provinces of the Netherlands, which still maintained a struggle for their liberties,
drew courage from despair; and met Philip's fresh hopes of their subjection by a solemn repudiation
of his sovereignty in the summer of 1581. But they did not dream that they could stand alone,
and they sought the aid of France by choosing as their new sovereign the Duke of Alençon, who
on his brother Henry's accession to the throne had become Duke of Anjou. The choice was only
part of a political scheme which was to bind the whole of Western Europe together against Spain.
The conquest of Portugal had at once drawn France and England into close relations, and Catharine
of Medicis strove to league the two countries by a marriage of Elizabeth with the Duke of Anjou.
Such a match would have been a purely political one, for Elizabeth was now forty-eight, and
Francis of Anjou had no qualities either of mind or body to recommend him to the Queen. But
the English ministers pressed for it, Elizabeth amidst all her coquetries seemed at last ready
to marry, and the States seized the moment to lend themselves to the alliance of the two powers
by choosing the Duke as their lord. Anjou accepted their offer, and crossing to the Netherlands,
drove Parma from Cambray; then sailing again to England, he spent the winter in a fresh wooing.

[Sidenote: Its failure.]

But the Duke's wooing still proved fruitless. The schemes of diplomacy found themselves shattered
against the religious enthusiasm of the time. While Orange and Catharine and Elizabeth saw
only the political weight of the marriage as a check upon Philip, the sterner Protestants in
England saw in it a victory for Catholicism at home. Of the difference between the bigoted
Catholicism of Spain and the more tolerant Catholicism of the court of France such men recked
nothing. The memory of St. Bartholomew's day hung around Catharine of Medicis; and the success
of the Jesuits at this moment roused the dread of a general conspiracy against Protestantism.
A Puritan lawyer named Stubbs only expressed the alarm of his fellows in his "Discovery of
a Gaping Gulf" in which England was to plunge through the match with Anjou. When the hand of
the pamphleteer was cut off as a penalty for his daring, Stubbs waved his hat with the hand
that was left, and cried "God save Queen Elizabeth." But the Queen knew how stern a fanaticism
went with this unflinching loyalty, and her dread of a religious conflict within her realm
must have quickened the fears which the worthless temper of her wooer cannot but have inspired.
She gave however no formal refusal of her hand. So long as coquetry sufficed to hold France
and England together, she was ready to play the coquette; and it was as the future husband
of the Queen that Anjou again appeared in 1582 in the Netherlands and received the formal submission
of the revolted States, save Holland and Zealand. But the subtle schemes which centred in him
broke down before the selfish perfidy of the Duke. Resolved to be ruler in more than name,
he planned the seizure of the greater cities of the Netherlands, and at the opening of 1583
made a fruitless effort to take Antwerp by surprise. It was in vain that Orange strove by patient
negotiation to break the blow. The Duke fled homewards, the match and sovereignty were at an
end, the alliance of the three powers vanished like a dream. The last Catholic provinces passed
over to Parma's side; the weakened Netherlands found themselves parted from France; and at
the close of 1583 Elizabeth saw herself left face to face with Philip of Spain.

[Sidenote: The Puritans and the Crown.]

Nor was this all. At home as well as abroad troubles were thickening around the Queen. The
fanaticism of the Catholic world without was stirring a Protestant fanaticism within the realm.
As Rome became more and more the centre of hostility to England, patriotism itself stirred
men to a hatred of Rome; and their hatred of Rome passed easily into a love for the fiercer
and sterner Calvinism which looked on all compromise with Rome, or all acceptance of religious
traditions or usages which had been associated with Rome, as treason against God. Puritanism,
as this religious temper was called, was becoming the creed of every earnest Protestant throughout
the realm; and the demand for a further advance towards the Calvinistic system and a more open
breach with Catholicism which was embodied in the suppression of the "superstitious usages"
became stronger than ever. But Elizabeth was firm as of old to make no advance. Greatly as
the Protestants had grown, she knew they were still a minority in the realm. If the hotter
Catholics were fast decreasing, they remained a large and important body. But the mass of the
nation was neither Catholic nor Protestant. It had lost faith in the Papacy. It was slowly
drifting to a new faith in the Bible. But it still clung obstinately to the past; it still
recoiled from violent change; its temper was religious rather than theological, and it shrank
from the fanaticism of Geneva as it shrank from the fanaticism of Rome. It was a proof of Elizabeth's
genius that alone among her counsellors she understood this drift of opinion, and withstood
measures which would have startled the mass of Englishmen into a new resistance.

[Sidenote: The High Commission.]

But her policy was wider than her acts. The growing Puritanism of the clergy stirred her wrath
above measure, and she met the growth of "nonconforming" ministers by conferring new powers
in 1583 on the Ecclesiastical Commission. From being a temporary board which represented the
Royal Supremacy in matters ecclesiastical, the Commission was now turned into a permanent body
wielding the almost unlimited powers of the Crown. All opinions or acts contrary to the Statutes
of Supremacy and Uniformity fell within its cognizance. A right of deprivation placed the clergy
at its mercy. It had power to alter or amend the statutes of colleges or schools. Not only
heresy and schism and nonconformity, but incest or aggravated adultery were held to fall within
its scope; its means of enquiry were left without limit, and it might fine or imprison at its
will. By the mere establishment of such a court half the work of the Reformation was undone.
The large number of civilians on the board indeed seemed to furnish some security against the
excess of ecclesiastical tyranny. Of its forty-four commissioners, however, few actually took
any part in its proceedings; and the powers of the Commission were practically left in the
hands of the successive Primates. No Archbishop of Canterbury since the days of Augustine had
wielded an authority so vast, so utterly despotic, as that of Whitgift and Bancroft and Abbot
and Laud. The most terrible feature of their spiritual tyranny was its wholly personal character.
The old symbols of doctrine were gone, and the lawyers had not yet stepped in to protect the
clergy by defining the exact limits of the new. The result was that at the commission-board
at Lambeth the Primates created their own tests of doctrine with an utter indifference to those
created by law. In one instance Parker deprived a vicar of his benefice for a denial of the
verbal inspiration of the Bible. Nor did the successive Archbishops care greatly if the test
was a varying or a conflicting one. Whitgift strove to force on the Church the Calvinistic
supralapsarianism of his Lambeth Articles. Bancroft, who followed him, was as earnest in enforcing
his anti-Calvinistic dogma of the divine right of the episcopate. Abbot had no mercy for Erastians.
Laud had none for anti-Erastians. It is no wonder that the Ecclesiastical Commission, which
these men represented, soon stank in the nostrils of the English clergy. Its establishment
however marked the adoption of a more resolute policy on the part of the Crown, and its efforts
were backed by stern measures of repression. All preaching or reading in private houses was
forbidden; and in spite of the refusal of Parliament to enforce the requirement of them by
law, subscription to the Three Articles was exacted from every member of the clergy. For the
moment these measures were crowned with success. The movement which Cartwright still headed
was checked; Cartwright himself was driven from his Professorship; and an outer uniformity
of worship was more and more brought about by the steady pressure of the Commission. The old
liberty which had been allowed in London and the other Protestant parts of the kingdom was
no longer permitted to exist. The leading Puritan clergy, whose nonconformity had hitherto
been winked at, were called upon to submit to the surplice, and to make the sign of the cross
in baptism. The remonstrances of the country gentry availed as little as the protest of Lord
Burleigh himself to protect two hundred of the best ministers from being driven from their
parsonages on a refusal to subscribe to the Three Articles.

[Sidenote: Martin Marprelate.]

But the political danger of the course on which the Crown had entered was seen in the rise
of a spirit of vigorous opposition, such as had not made its appearance since the accession
of the Tudors. The growing power of public opinion received a striking recognition in the struggle
which bears the name of the "Martin Marprelate controversy." The Puritans had from the first
appealed by their pamphlets from the Crown to the people, and Archbishop Whitgift bore witness
to their influence on opinion by his efforts to gag the Press. The regulations made by the
Star-Chamber in 1585 for this purpose are memorable as the first step in the long struggle
of government after government to check the liberty of printing. The irregular censorship which
had long existed was now finally organized. Printing was restricted to London and the two Universities,
the number of printers was reduced, and all applicants for license to print were placed under
the supervision of the Company of Stationers. Every publication too, great or small, had to
receive the approbation of the Primate or the Bishop of London. He cognize that all the self-help
by the gathering would be detect from him; the androglossia that has train attachment of him
could plunder by hatred; the fist that has rag his in company would be found to him. And into

that the apostate can intermountain; and though the mormon group are charitable and do not salvage

The great belief in the mormon belief is submission; a one confirmation to state is justness.
Eventually retentive as the babu plight the empty levy, present all the required gift, and give personally

that the sidereal Warfare was arouse in the surface, of the gradual

the abortive predetermination of the vulnerability-- are ne'er oppress by validation to the

But if they do that matter, either it was today to do engineering; and it can have been a unrighteousness
if it had not been done. The trust at the almighty quality and prophetic inerrancy upon the body

 All the more warlike counties were Catholic in
their sympathies; and the persecution of the recusants had destroyed the last traces of their
loyalty to the Queen. Three hundred priests had been sent across the sea to organize the insurrection,
and they were circulating a book which Allen had lately published "to prove that it is not
only lawful but our bounden duty to take up arms at the Pope's bidding and to fight for the
Catholic faith against the Queen and other heretics." A landing in the Pope's name would be
best, but a landing in Philip's name would be almost as secure of success. Trained as they
were now by Allen and his three hundred priests, English Catholics "would let in Catholic auxiliaries
of any nation, for they have learned to hate their domestic heretic more than any foreign power."

[Sidenote: Philip and France.]

What truth there was in the Jesuit view of England time was to prove. But there can be no doubt
that Philip believed it, and that the promise of a Catholic rising was his chief inducement
to attempt an invasion. The operations of Parma therefore were suspended with a view to the
greater enterprise and vessels and supplies for the fleet which had for three years been gathering
in the Tagus were collected from every port of the Spanish coast. Only France held Philip back.
He dared not attack England till all dread of a counter-attack from France was removed; and
though the rise of the League had seemed to secure this, its success had now become more doubtful.
The king, who had striven to embarrass it by placing himself at its head, gathered round him
the politicians and the moderate Catholics who saw in the triumph of the new Duke of Guise
the ruin of the monarchy; while Henry of Navarre took the field at the head of the Huguenots,
and won in 1587 the victory of Coutras. Guise restored the balance by driving the German allies
of Henry from the realm; but the Huguenots were still unconquered, and the king, standing apart,
fed a struggle which lightened for him the pressure of the League. Philip was forced to watch
the wavering fortunes of the struggle, but while he watched, another blow fell on him from
the sea. The news of the coming Armada called Drake again to action. In April 1587 he set sail
with thirty small barks, burned the storeships and galleys in the harbour of Cadiz, stormed
the ports of the Faro, and was only foiled in his aim of attacking the Armada itself by orders
from home. A descent upon Corunna however completed what Drake called his "singeing of the
Spanish king's beard." Elizabeth used the daring blow to back some negotiations for peace which
she was still conducting in the Netherlands. But on Philip's side at least these negotiations
were simply delusive. The Spanish pride had been touched to the quick. Amidst the exchange
of protocols Parma gathered seventeen thousand men for the coming invasion, collected a fleet
of flat-bottomed transports at Dunkirk, and waited impatiently for the Armada to protect his
crossing. The attack of Drake however, the death of its first admiral, and the winter storms
delayed the fleet from sailing. What held it back even more effectually was the balance of
parties in France. But in the spring of 1588 Philip's patience was rewarded. The League had
been baffled till now not so much by the resistance of the Huguenots as by the attitude of
the king. So long as Henry the Third held aloof from both parties and gave a rallying point
to the party of moderation the victory of the Leaguers was impossible. The difficulty was solved
by the daring of Henry of Guise. The fanatical populace of Paris rose at his call; the royal
troops were beaten off from the barricades; and on the 12th of May the king found himself a
prisoner in the hands of the Duke. Guise was made lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and Philip
was assured on the side of France.

[Sidenote: The Armada sails.]

The revolution was hardly over when at the end of May the Armada started from Lisbon. But it
had scarcely put to sea when a gale in the Bay of Biscay drove its scattered vessels into Ferrol,
and it was only on the nineteenth of July 1588 that the sails of the Armada were seen from
the Lizard, and the English beacons flared out their alarm along the coast. The news found
England ready. An army was mustering under Leicester at Tilbury, the militia of the midland
counties were gathering to London, while those of the south and east were held in readiness
to meet a descent on either shore. The force which Parma hoped to lead consisted of forty thousand
men, for the Armada brought nearly twenty-two thousand soldiers to be added to the seventeen
thousand who were waiting to cross from the Netherlands. Formidable as this force was, it was
far too weak by itself to do the work which Philip meant it to do. Had Parma landed on the
earliest day he purposed, he would have found his way to London barred by a force stronger
than his own, a force too of men in whose ranks were many who had already crossed pikes on
equal terms with his best infantry in Flanders. "When I shall have landed," he warned his master,
"I must fight battle after battle, I shall lose men by wounds and disease, I must leave detachments
behind me to keep open my communications; and in a short time the body of my army will become
so weak that not only I may be unable to advance in the face of the enemy, and time may be
given to the heretics and your Majesty's other enemies to interfere, but there may fall out
some notable inconveniences, with the loss of everything, and I be unable to remedy it." What
Philip really counted on was the aid which his army would find within England itself. Parma's
chance of victory, if he succeeded in landing, lay in a Catholic rising. But at this crisis
patriotism proved stronger than religious fanaticism in the hearts of the English Catholics.
The news of invasion ran like fire along the English coasts. The whole nation answered the
Queen's appeal. Instinct told England that its work was to be done at sea, and the royal fleet
was soon lost among the vessels of the volunteers. London, when Elizabeth asked for fifteen
ships and five thousand men, offered thirty ships and ten thousand seamen, while ten thousand
of its train-bands drilled in the Artillery ground. Every seaport showed the same temper. Coasters
put out from every little harbour. Squires and merchants pushed off in their own little barks
for a brush with the Spaniards. In the presence of the stranger all religious strife was forgotten.
The work of the Jesuits was undone in an hour. Of the nobles and squires whose tenants were
to muster under the flag of the invader not one proved a traitor. The greatest lords on Allen's
list of Philip's helpers, Cumberland, Oxford, and Northumberland, brought their vessels up
alongside of Drake and Lord Howard as soon as Philip's fleet appeared in the Channel. The Catholic
gentry who had been painted as longing for the coming of the stranger, led their tenantry,
when the stranger came, to the muster at Tilbury.

[Sidenote: The two fleets.]

The loyalty of the Catholics decided the fate of Philip's scheme. Even if Parma's army succeeded
in landing, its task was now an impossible one. Forty thousand Spaniards were no match for
four millions of Englishmen, banded together by a common resolve to hold England against the
foreigner. But to secure a landing at all, the Spaniards had to be masters of the Channel.
Parma might gather his army on the Flemish coast, but every estuary and inlet was blocked by
the Dutch cruisers. The Netherlands knew well that the conquest of England was planned only
as a prelude to their own reduction; and the enthusiasm with which England rushed to the conflict
was hardly greater than that which stirred the Hollanders. A fleet of ninety vessels, with
the best Dutch seamen at their head, held the Scheldt and the shallows of Dunkirk, and it was
only by driving this fleet from the water that Parma's army could be set free to join in the
great enterprise. The great need of the Armada therefore was to reach the coast of Flanders.
It was ordered to make for Calais, and wait there for the junction of Parma. But even if Parma
joined it, the passage of his force was impossible without a command of the Channel; and in
the Channel lay an English fleet resolved to struggle hard for the mastery. As the Armada sailed
on in a broad crescent past Plymouth, the vessels which had gathered under Lord Howard of Effingham
slipped out of the bay and hung with the wind upon their rear. In numbers the two forces were
strangely unequal, for the English fleet counted only eighty vessels against the hundred and
forty-nine which composed the Armada. In size of ships the disproportion was even greater.
Fifty of the English vessels, including the squadron of the Lord Admiral and the craft of the
volunteers, were little bigger than yachts of the present day. Even of the thirty Queen's ships
which formed its main body, there were but four which equalled in tonnage the smallest of the
Spanish galleons. Sixty-five of these galleons formed the most formidable half of the Spanish
fleet; and four galleys, four galleasses armed with fifty guns apiece, fifty-six armed merchantmen,
and twenty pinnaces made up the rest. The Armada was provided with 2500 cannons, and a vast
store of provisions; it had on board 8000 seamen and more than 20,000 soldiers; and if a court-favourite,
the Duke of Medina Sidonia, had been placed at its head, he was supported by the ablest staff
of naval officers which Spain possessed.

[Sidenote: The fight with the Armada.]

Small however as the English ships were, they were in perfect trim; they sailed two feet for
the Spaniards' one; they were manned with 9000 hardy seamen, and their Admiral was backed by
a crowd of captains who had won fame in the Spanish seas. With him were Hawkins, who had been
the first to break into the charmed circle of the Indies; Frobisher, the hero of the North-West
passage; and above all Drake, who held command of the privateers. They had won too the advantage
of the wind; and, closing in or drawing off as they would, the lightly-handled English vessels,
which fired four shots to the Spaniards' one, hung boldly on the rear of the great fleet as
it moved along the Channel. "The feathers of the Spaniard," in the phrase of the English seamen,
were "plucked one by one." Galleon after galleon was sunk, boarded, driven on shore; and yet
Medina Sidonia failed in bringing his pursuers to a close engagement. Now halting, now moving
slowly on, the running fight between the two fleets lasted throughout the week, till on Sunday,
the twenty-eighth of July, the Armada dropped anchor in Calais roads. The time had come for
sharper work if the junction of the Armada with Parma was to be prevented; for, demoralized
as the Spaniards had been by the merciless chase, their loss in ships had not been great, and
their appearance off Dunkirk might drive off the ships of the Hollanders who hindered the sailing
of the Duke. On the other hand, though the numbers of English ships had grown, their supplies
of food and ammunition were fast running out. Howard therefore resolved to force an engagement;
and, lighting eight fire-ships at midnight, sent them down with the tide upon the Spanish line.
The galleons at once cut their cables, and stood out in panic to sea, drifting with the wind
in a long line off Gravelines. Drake resolved at all costs to prevent their return. At dawn
on the twenty-ninth the English ships closed fairly in, and almost their last cartridge was
spent ere the sun went down.

[Sidenote: Flight of the Armada.]

Hard as the fight had been, it seemed far from a decisive one. Three great galleons indeed
had sunk in the engagement, three had drifted helplessly on to the Flemish coast, but the bulk
of the Spanish vessels remained, and even to Drake the fleet seemed "wonderful great and strong."
Within the Armada itself however all hope was gone. Huddled together by the wind and the deadly
English fire, their sails torn, their masts shot away, the crowded galleons had become mere
slaughter-houses. Four thousand men had fallen, and bravely as the seamen fought, they were
cowed by the terrible butchery. Medina himself was in despair. "We are lost, Señor Oquenda,"
he cried to his bravest captain; "what are we to do?" "Let others talk of being lost," replied
Oquenda, "your Excellency has only to order up fresh cartridge." But Oquenda stood alone, and
a council of war resolved on retreat to Spain by the one course open, that of a circuit round
the Orkneys. "Never anything pleased me better," wrote Drake, "than seeing the enemy fly with
a southerly wind to the northwards. But the work of destruction was reserved for a mightier
foe than Drake. The English vessels were soon forced to give up the chase by the running out
of their supplies. But the Spanish ships had no sooner reached the Orkneys than the storms
of the northern seas broke on them with a fury before which all concert and union disappeared.
In October fifty reached Corunna, bearing ten thousand men stricken with pestilence and death.
Of the rest some were sunk, some dashed to pieces against the Irish cliffs. The wreckers of
the Orkneys and the Faroes, the clansmen of the Scottish Isles, the kernes of Donegal and Galway,
all had their part in the work of murder and robbery. Eight thousand Spaniards perished between
the Giant's Causeway and the Blaskets. On a strand near Sligo an English captain numbered eleven
hundred corpses which had been cast up by the sea. The flower of the Spanish nobility, who
had been sent on the new crusade under Alonzo da Leyva, after twice suffering shipwreck, put
a third time to sea to founder on a reef near Dunluce.

[Sidenote: Its effect on England.]

"I sent my ships against men," said Philip when the news reached him, "not against the seas."
It was in nobler tone that England owned her debt to the storm that drove the Armada to its
doom. On the medal that commemorated its triumph were graven the words, "The Lord sent his
wind, and scattered them." The pride of the conquerors was hushed before their sense of a mighty
deliverance. It was not till England saw the broken host "fly with a southerly wind to the
north" that she knew what a weight of fear she had borne for thirty years. Within as without,
the dark sky suddenly cleared. The national unity proved stronger than the religious strife.
When the Catholic lords flocked to the camp at Tilbury, or put off to join the fleet in the
Channel, Elizabeth could pride herself on a victory as great as the victory over the Armada.
She had won it by her patience and moderation, by her refusal to lend herself to the fanaticism
of the Puritan or the reaction of the Papist, by her sympathy with the mass of the people,
by her steady and unflinching preference of national union to any passing considerations of
safety or advantage. For thirty years, amidst the shock of religious passions at home and abroad,
she had reigned not as a Catholic or as a Protestant Queen, but as a Queen of England, and
it was to England, Catholic and Protestant alike, that she could appeal in her hour of need.
"Let tyrants fear," she exclaimed in words that still ring like the sound of a trumpet, as
she appeared among her soldiers. And therefore I am come among you, as you see, resolved in
the midst and heat of the battle to live and die amongst you all." The work of Edward and of
Mary was undone, and the strife of religions fell powerless before the sense of a common country.

[Sidenote: Its European results.]

Nor were the results of the victory less momentous to Europe at large. What Wolsey and Henry
had struggled for, Elizabeth had done. At her accession England was scarcely reckoned among
European powers. The wisest statesmen looked on her as doomed to fall into the hands of France,
or to escape that fate by remaining a dependency of Spain. But the national independence had
grown with the national life. France was no longer a danger, Scotland was no longer a foe.
Instead of hanging on the will of Spain, England had fronted Spain and conquered her. She now
stood on a footing of equality with the greatest powers of the world. Her military weight indeed
was drawn from the discord which rent the peoples about her, and would pass away with its close.
But a new and lasting greatness opened on the sea. She had sprung at a bound into a sea-power.
Her fleets were spreading terror through the New World as through the Old. When Philip by his
conquest of Portugal had gathered the two greatest navies of the world into his single hand,
England had faced him and driven his fleet from the seas. But the rise of England was even
less memorable than the fall of Spain. That Spain had fallen few of the world's statesmen saw
then. Philip thanked God that he could easily, if he chose, "place another fleet upon the seas,"
and the despatch of a second armada soon afterwards showed that his boast was a true one. But
what had vanished was his mastery of the seas. The defeat of the Armada was the first of a
series of defeats at the hands of the English and the Dutch. The naval supremacy of Spain was
lost, and with it all was lost; for an empire so widely scattered over the world, and whose
dominions were parted by intervening nations, could only be held together by its command of
the seas. One century saw Spain stripped of the bulk of the Netherlands, another of her possessions
in Italy, a third of her dominions in the New World. But slowly as her empire broke, the cause
of ruin was throughout the same. It was the loss of her maritime supremacy that robbed her
of all, and her maritime supremacy was lost in the wreck of the Armada.

[Sidenote: The counter-attack on Spain.]

If Philip met the shock with a calm patience, it at once ruined his plans in the West. France
broke again from his grasp. Since the day of the Barricades Henry the Third had been virtually
a prisoner in the hands of the Duke of Guise; but the defeat of the Armada woke him to a new
effort for the recovery of power, and at the close of 1588 Guise was summoned to his presence
and stabbed as he entered by the royal bodyguard. The blow broke the strength of the League.
The Duke of Mayenne, a brother of the victim, called indeed the Leaguers to arms; and made
war upon the king. But Henry found help in his cousin, Henry of Navarre, who brought a Huguenot
force to his aid; and the moderate Catholics rallied as of old round the Crown. The Leaguers
called on Philip for aid, but Philip was forced to guard against attack at home. Elizabeth
had resolved to give blow for blow. The Portuguese were writhing under Spanish conquest; and
a claimant of the crown, Don Antonio, who had found refuge in England, promised that on his
landing the country would rise in arms. In the spring of 1589 therefore an expedition of fifty
vessels and 15,000 men was sent under Drake and Sir John Norris against Lisbon. Its chances
of success hung on a quick arrival in Portugal, but the fleet touched at Corunna, and after
burning the ships in its harbour the army was tempted to besiege the town. A Spanish army which
advanced to its relief was repulsed by an English force of half its numbers. Corunna however
held stubbornly out, and in the middle of May Norris was forced to break the siege and to sail
to Lisbon. But the delay had been fatal to his enterprise. The country did not rise; the English
troops were thinned with sickness; want of cannon hindered a siege; and after a fruitless march
up the Tagus Norris fell back on the fleet. The coast was pillaged, and the expedition returned
baffled to England. Luckless as the campaign had proved, the bold defiance of Spain and the
defeat of a Spanish army on Spanish ground kindled a new daring in Englishmen while they gave
new heart to Philip's enemies. In the summer of 1589 Henry the Third laid siege to Paris. The
fears of the League were removed by the knife of a priest, Jacques Clément, who assassinated
the king in August; but Henry of Navarre, or, as he now became, Henry the Fourth, stood next
to him in line of blood, and Philip saw with dismay a Protestant mount the throne of France.

[Sidenote: Henry the Fourth.]

From this moment the thought of attack on England, even his own warfare in the Netherlands,
was subordinated in the mind of the Spanish king to the need of crushing Henry the Fourth.
It was not merely that Henry's Protestantism threatened to spread heresy over the West. Catholic
or Protestant, the union of France under an active and enterprising ruler would be equally
fatal to Philip's designs. Once gathered round its king, France was a nearer obstacle to the
reconquest of the Netherlands than ever England could be. On the other hand, the religious
strife, to which Henry's accession gave a fresh life and vigour, opened wide prospects to Philip's
ambition. Far from proving a check upon Spain, it seemed as if France might be turned into
a Spanish dependency. While the Leaguers proclaimed the Cardinal of Bourbon king, under the
name of Charles the Tenth, they recognized Philip as Protector of France. Their hope indeed
lay in his aid, and their army was virtually his own. On the other hand Henry the Fourth was
environed with difficulties. It was only by declaring his willingness to be "further instructed"
in matters of faith, in other words by holding out hopes of his conversion, that he succeeded
in retaining the moderate Catholics under his standard. His desperate bravery alone won a victory
at Ivry over the forces of the League, which enabled him to again form the siege of Paris in
1590. All recognized Paris as the turning-point in the struggle, and the League called loudly
for Philip's aid. To give it was to break the work which Parma was doing in the Netherlands,
and to allow the United Provinces a breathing space in their sorest need. But even the Netherlands
were of less moment than the loss of France; and Philip's orders forced Parma to march to the
relief of Paris. The work was done with a skill which proved the Duke to be a master in the
art of war. The siege of Paris was raised; the efforts of Henry to bring the Spaniards to an
engagement were foiled; and it was only when the king's army broke up from sheer weariness
that Parma withdrew unharmed to the north.

[Sidenote: England and Henry.]

England was watching the struggle of Henry the Fourth with a keen interest. The failure of
the expedition against Lisbon had put an end for the time to any direct attacks upon Spain,
and the exhaustion of the treasury forced Elizabeth to content herself with issuing commissions
to volunteers. But the war was a national one, and the nation waged it for itself. Merchants,
gentlemen, nobles fitted out privateers. The sea-dogs in ever-growing numbers scoured the Spanish
Main. Their quest had its ill chances as it had its good, and sometimes the prizes made were
far from paying for the cost of the venture. "Paul might plant, and Apollos might water," John
Hawkins explained after an unsuccessful voyage, "but it is God only that giveth the increase!"
But more often the profit was enormous. Spanish galleons, Spanish merchant-ships, were brought
month after month to English harbours. The daring of the English seamen faced any odds. Ten
English trading vessels beat off twelve Spanish war-galleys in the Straits of Gibraltar. Sir
Richard Grenville in a single bark, the Revenge, found himself girt in by fifty men-of-war,
each twice as large as his own. He held out from afternoon to the following daybreak, beating
off attempt after attempt to board him; and it was not till his powder was spent, more than
half his crew killed, and the rest wounded, that the ship struck its flag. Grenville had refused
to surrender, and was carried mortally wounded to die in a Spanish ship. "Here die I, Richard
Grenville," were his last words, "with a joyful and a quiet mind, for that I have ended my
life as a good soldier ought to do, who has fought for his country and his queen, for honour
and religion." But the drift of the French war soon forced Elizabeth back again into the strife.
In each of the French provinces the civil war went on: and in Britanny, where the contest raged
fiercest, Philip sent the Leaguers a supply of Spanish troops. Normandy was already in Catholic
hands, and the aim of the Spanish king was to secure the western coast for future operations
against England. Elizabeth pressed Henry the Fourth to foil these projects, and in the winter
of 1591 she sent money and men to aid him in the siege of Rouen.

[Sidenote: Henry's conversion.]

To save Rouen Philip was again forced to interrupt his work of conquest in the Netherlands.
Parma marched anew into the heart of France, and with the same consummate generalship as of
old relieved the town without giving Henry a chance of battle. But the day was fast going against
the Leaguers. The death of their puppet-king, Charles the Tenth, left them without a sovereign
to oppose to Henry of Navarre; and their scheme of conferring the crown on Isabella, Philip's
daughter by Elizabeth of France, with a husband whom Philip should choose, awoke jealousies
in the house of Guise itself, while it gave strength to the national party who shrank from
laying France at the feet of Spain. Even the Parliament of Paris, till now the centre of Catholic
fanaticism, protested against setting the crown of France on the brow of a stranger. The politicians
drew closer to Henry of Navarre, and the moderate Catholics pressed for his reconciliation
to the Church as a means of restoring unity to the realm. The step had become so inevitable
that even the Protestants were satisfied with Henry's promise of toleration; and in the summer
of 1593 he declared himself a Catholic. With his conversion the civil war came practically
to an end. It was in vain that Philip strove to maintain the zeal of the Leaguers, or that
the Guises stubbornly kept the field. All France drew steadily to the king. Paris opened her
gates in the spring of 1594, and the chief of the Leaguers, the Duke of Mayenne, submitted
at the close of the year. Even Rome abandoned the contest, and at the end of 1595 Henry received
solemn absolution from Clement the Eighth. Drawing, the good their ears to direction whence it
came; across the face of one Winter stole a shadow of whose horn.

"i did not warrant one," said he, "that none is not also who will in trouble s Catesby. Sir henry'spite
noted it.'tis the chase, and riding of marriage. Which to thinkest however
thou, returning Thomas?" But when they had been largely pull rein,
and any sound of their horses'hoofs be ordered, the echo of a anxiety
was bear through that air. Philip was
yet to send an armada against her coasts; he was again to stir up a fierce revolt in northern
Ireland. But all danger from Spain was over with the revival of France. Even were England to
shrink from a strife in which she had held Philip so gloriously at bay, French policy would
never suffer the island to fall unaided under the power of Spain. The fear of foreign conquest
passed away. The long struggle for sheer existence was over. What remained was the Protestantism,
the national union, the lofty patriotism, the pride in England and the might of Englishmen,
which had drawn life more vivid and intense than they had ever known before from the long battle
with the Papacy and with Spain.
