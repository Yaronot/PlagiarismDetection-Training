 

With the smog, the snarling drunk again, and cleared his throat, and coughing, as if trying to
remember yes. The blind did not make him more attention than a dog, attentive only to their
prayers in that language know whether it was Arabic or Hebrew, covering one eye in each hand,
and lowering them later on mouth to kiss. Median time spent in meditation, and when finished, was
sitting before him with eyes slut lloricones elusive and, because of the itching caused by
the thick incense, looked at him. Seriously presenting palms, Almudena I let these words:

"Great
pick, not having more than one God ... b'rracha, b'rrachona not be
more than one God ... a God, a God alone, alone.

"

He dropped another hearty laugh, and touching his chest, he wanted to clean up the mess concerned
that the hand of his roommate had caused in that part interesting of person. Clumsy sleep out alcoholic
who could not quite put everything in its site or to cover the modesty seeks and ever sought
to be covered. "Jai, you I've arregistrao.

- Yes ... Not have more than one God, one God alone.

- And to me,
what?

For me who have already two or forty, all that they themselves want to have ... But tell me, sponger,
I've removed the peseta. I do not care. Pa ti era.

- A God alone! ".

And seeing him take the stick, put women on guard, saying, "Hey, do
not hit, Jai.

Enough and of incense, and get to make dinner. How much money do you have? What do you bring?
...

- B'rrachona! diniero failing ... Take the Embaixador, you sleep.

- What do you bring? - Murmured the black woman staggered and closing
his eyes -.

Aguárdate a little bit. I have dream, Jai. "

He fell back into deep sleep, and Almudena, which had required the club with intentions using
it as an infallible remedy for drunkenness, took pity and sighed hard, muttering these or similar
words: "Paste you another day."

VI

Almost is not hyperbole to say that the Sena Benina, after leaving Santa Casilda, possessing
incomplete hard that calmed his mortal anguish, going in rounds, and street crossings as an arrow.
With sixty years back, kept his agility and alertness, coupled with
perseverance inexhaustible. He had spent the best of life in an eager
rush, which required much activity as a prank, crazy efforts of the
mind and muscles, and that teaching was fortified in body and spirit,
it formed the special temple woman will know who read this timely
story of his life. With amazing alacrity entered in a drugstore in
the Calle de Toledo, collected medicines had ordered early in the
morning, then did stop at the butcher shop and grocery store, carrying
her shopping distinct wrapping paper, and finally entered a house
in Imperial Street, near the Rinconada that is the True almotacén
and Contrast. Total, that will to die of shame, and if a hand comes, rejoice in see a poor beggar
on the floor. "

Almudena his face turned toward her, and could even be said to be looked at, if you look at
is direct eyes toward an object, making them, since you have not seen, intent, and in some attention
mode, as sustained as ineffective. Squeezing her hand, said, "Amri,
you know that he serve Almudena, Almudena me, like Pierre.

Amri, dicermi things you ... tigo things.

- Let's go down, and talk on the road. Are you going home?

- I do want you.

- It seems that you get tired. We very quickly. Is it all right for us to sit a while in the Progress
Square to talk peacefully? ".

No doubt The blind man said yes, because five minutes after they were seen sitting side by side
in the base of the fence surrounding the statue of Mendizabal. The face Almudena, an ugly
expression, dark citrine, with wispy beard, black as the raven's wing, was characterized mainly
by the excessive grandeur of the mouth, when he smiled, affected a curve whose ends, replicating
the loose skin of the cheek, got too close ears. The eyes were like sores and dry and insensitive,
surrounded by patches sanguine; medium size, crooked legs. His body
had lost its graceful shape by the habit of walking in the dark, and
spend long hours sitting on the floor with legs Moorish folded. Decency
wore on, as his clothes, but old and full of dirt, did not tear or
damage which were not amended by a darned smart patches or applications
and patches. The room we lived in was the last of the Almudena ground
floor, at ground level, and we did not have to cross a single step to enter it. The house was
made up of the two pieces separated by a mat roof slope. Next was the kitchen, another room,
also a room or cabinet, with a well-beaten dirt floor, white walls, which were not as dirty as others
of the same human or burrows mansion. A saddle was the only piece of furniture, because the
bed was a mattress and brown blankets, leaning around an angle. The stove was not without pots,
pans, bottles, nor food. In the center of the room, he saw a black
figure Benina, something like a bundle of clothes, or an abandoned
bag. I get tired of suffering, I also tired of waiting. My hope is treacherous, and
as always fool me, I do not want to expect good things and bad I hope to come ... even regular.

- For me that Mrs. - said Benina giving the bellows - have trust in God, and would happy ... You
see, I'm ... Did I not see? I always think that when we least expect it We come the stroke of
luck, and we so richly, remembering the days of trouble, and retribution of them with the great
life that we're going to give.

- I do not aspire to the good life, Nina - said almost crying Mrs. -: I aspire only to rest.

-
Who do you think about death?

That does not: I feel very comfortable in this world fandanguero,
and until I have him for odd jobs law happened.

Not die.

- Would you settle for this life?

- I'm satisfied because it is not
in my power to give me another.

Come all before death, and we suffer provided they do not miss a piece of bread and can eat
with two sauces a very good: hunger and hope.

- And support, and of misery, shame, humiliation so, due to worldwide not pay anyone to live a
thousand tangles, traps and tricks, not to find who you rely value two real keepers ourselves
persecuted and sellers?

- Go if you take it! ... Everyone in this life, as can be defended. It would be good We starve,
while the shops so full of things of substance! That does not: God does not want no one would
cool the roof of the mouth by not eating, and when it gives us money, assume, gives us the
subtlety of caletre to invent ways of gathering what he does fail,
without stealing ... not that.

Because I promise to pay, and pay when we have it. You know we are
poor ... formality at home there as haiga no more. It would be good
afflict us because the shopkeepers do not charge these miseries, knowing,
as we know, which are rich! ...

- Is that you have no shame, Nina,
I mean, decency, I mean dignity. So nervous was the man, that it uncovered
what should be covered, and hid that which enjoys the light of day. There he took out rosaries, scapulae,
a bundle of pawn tickets rolled in a piece of newspaper, pieces of horseshoe picked up from the
streets, animal or people's molars, and other knickknacks. With the search finished, Benina entered,
already back from her task, which she had taken care of so quickly, like she was taken from and
back on wings by the angels of heaven. The poor woman came suffocated from the quick running in the
streets; she barely could breathe, and her sweat covered face emanated
fire, joy from her eyes.

"They have given me three -- she said while showing the coins --, one in quarters. I hadn't small
luck that Valeriano was there; that if the mistress was there, Reimunda,
it would be difficult to get two and change out of them".

Answering to the happiness of the old lady, Almudena, with a face full of joy and triumph, she
showed a quarter between her fingers.

"I found it here in her chest... Grab it Tigo. -- Oh, what luck!

Could she have more? Search well, son. -- it doesn't have more.

I moved things around her chest".

Benina tossed the clothes around the drunkard's clothes hoping to
see a coin jump out.

But nothing jumped out other than two hairpins, and some bits of coal.
"She doesn't have any more".

The blind man kept talking, and by the explanations given by the
character and customs of the big woman, he could understand that if
they had found her sober, she would have given them the quarter just
by asking.

 

And seizing him by the arm affectionate request, handed from one sidewalk to another. Soon gained
the Urosas Street, and standing on the corner, safe from cars and passers-by, again to say,
"I have to talk to you, because you can only get me a big commitment; yourself, because other
knowledge of the parish to serve me anything. "You find you? They are selfish hearts of flint
... Which has, because it has, who does not have, because no.
 They were always of brick or stone; they were of graceful shape, they had
vines and flowers about them already, and around them the grass was bright and green, and showed
that it was carefully looked after. 

With this came the gathering and tranquility that the vehemence of some altered so often, and
either order groaning and yawning pray they spent their sad hours.

Now it must be said that the absence of the Sena and blind Benina Almudena was no accident that
day for which there are explanations of an event that deserves mention in this true history.
They left two, as has been said, one after another, unlike a few minutes; but as the old woman
stopped at the gate for a while, talking to Pulido, the blind Moroccan
joined him and both went away together through the streets of San
Sebastian and Atocha.

"I stopped to chat with Polished wait, friend Almudena. I have to
talk to you. " 

And Cassian cut face with a horse, to give to monstrous proportions, said in a gloomy tone of compassion:
"Poor Don Carlos! is crazier than a goat."

The next morning, taking advantage of the community happy about which led to the parish or Almudena Benin
Sena blind, what a strange event comments. Demetra D. Carlos said shyly that he wanted to Benin
at your disposal, because it has enjoyed a reputation as a great chef, which he said, in effect,
this would have been a cooking teacher, but did not want in any part
of the old. "And ssion - Cassian said, emphasizing the word with
a vengeance -.

 Some
have had it hard and others were searching. Collectors use the Bankâs Satchel to cart beer
and soda bottles. Hearses are used to carry dead body to the cemetery.
