HAVE FOUND THE HILLS OF HINGHAM

PREFACE

The is not exactly the book I thought it was going to be--though I can say the same of its
author for that matter.  I had intended this book to set forth some features of the Earth that
make it to be preferred to Heaven as a place of present abode, and to note in detail the peculiar
attractions of Hingham over Boston, say,--Boston being quite the best city on the Earth to
live in.  I had the book started under the title "And this Our Life"

  . . . exempt from public haunt,
  Finds tongues in trees,"

--when, suddenly, war broke out, the gates of Hell swung wide open into Belgium, and Heaven
began to seem the better place.  Meanwhile, a series of lesser local troubles had been brewing--drouth,
caterpillars, rheumatism, increased commutation rates, more college themes,--more than I could
carry back and forth to Hingham,--so that as the writing went on Boston began to seem, not
a better place than Hingham, but a nearer place, somehow, and more thoroughly sprayed.

And all this time the book on Life that I thought I was writing was growing chapter by chapter
into a defense of that book--a defense of Life--my life here by my fireside with my boys and
Her, and the garden and woodlot and hens and bees, and days off and evenings at home and books
to read, yes, and books to write--all of which I had taken for granted at twenty, and believed
in with a beautiful faith at thirty, when I moved out here into what was then an uninfected forest. 

"Everywhere you will find them"
XIII
A GUEST NOT INVITED
During the calm after Mr. O'Brien's tale the porter and conductor rushed to the back platform; to
where it appears they had been called by the brakeman. The two appeared more worn and frazzled than
any other people I had ever bore witness to. A dirty, unbathed, smelly, freezing Hobo was pulled
into the car, to our astonishment! 
"Conductor, wait a minute,"
Colonel Manysnifters said, while the prisoner was being carried through.
"What is it you have there? Where did you find him? What is your identity,
sir?" he questioned the hobo. "Why are you here on this private unit,
and who are you?"

What men live by is an interesting speculative question, but what men live on, and where they
can live,--with children to bring up, and their own souls to save,--is an intensely practical
question which I have been working at these fourteen years here in the Hills of Hingham.

Really there are no hills in Hingham, to speak of, except Bradley Hill and Peartree Hill and
Turkey Hill, and Otis and Planter's and Prospect Hills, Hingham being more noted for its harbor
and plains.  Everybody has heard of Hingham smelts.  Mullein Hill is in Hingham, too, but Mullein
Hill is only a wrinkle on the face of Liberty Plain, which accounts partly for our having it.
Almost anybody can have a hill in Hingham who is content without elevation, a surveyor's term
as applied to hills, and a purely accidental property which is not at all essential to real
hillness, or the sense of height.  We have a stump on Mullein Hill for height.  A hill in Hingham
is not only possible, but even practical as compared with a Forest in Arden, Arden being altogether
too far from town; besides

  ". . . there's no clock in the forest"

and we have the 8.35 train to catch of a winter morning!

  "A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees"

sounds more pastoral than apple trees around a house on a hill in Hingham, and it would be
more ideal, too, if New England weather were not so much better adapted to apples, and if one
did not prefer apples, and if one could raise a family in a sheep-cote.

We started in the sheep-cote, back yonder when all the world was twenty or thereabouts, and
when every wild-cherry-bush was an olive tree.  But one day the tent caterpillar like a wolf
swept down on our fold of cherry-bushes and we fled Arden, never to get back.  We lived for
a time in town and bought olives in bottles, stuffed ones sometimes, then we got a hill in
Hingham, just this side of Arden, still buying our olives, but not our apples now, nor our
peaches, nor our musk melons, nor our wood for the open fire.  We buy commutation tickets,
and pay dearly for the trips back and forth.  But we could n't make a living in Arden.  Our
hill in Hingham is a compromise.

Only folk of twenty and close to twenty live in Arden.  We are forty now and no longer poets.
When we are really old and our grasshoppers become a burden, we may go back to town where the
insects are an entirely different species; but for this exceedingly busy present, between our
fading dawn of visions and our coming dusk of dreams, a hill in Hingham, though a compromise,
is an almost strategic position, Hingham being more or less of an escape from Boston, and the
hill, though not in the Forest of Arden, something of an escape from Hingham, a quaint old
village of elm-cooled streets and gentle neighbors.  Not that we hate Boston, nor that we pass
by on the other side in Hingham. We gladly pick our neighbors up and set them in our motor
car and bring them to the foot of the hill.  We people of the hills do not hate either crowds
or neighbors.  We are neighbors ourselves and parts of the city crowds too; and we love to
bind up wounds and bring folk to their inns.  But we cannot take them farther, for there are
no inns out here.  We leave them in Hingham and journey on alone into a region where neither
thief nor anyone infests the roadsides; where there are no roads in fact, but only driftways
and footpaths through the sparsely settled hills.

We leave the crowd on the streets, we leave the kind neighbor at his front gate, and travel
on, not very far, but on alone into a wide quiet country where we shall have a chance, perhaps,
of meeting with ourselves--the day's great adventure, and far to find; yet this is what we
have come out to the hills for.

Not for apples nor wood fires have we a hill in Hingham; not for hens and a bigger house, and
leisure, and conveniences, and excitements; not for ways to earn a living, nor for ways to
spend it.  Stay in town for that.  There "you can even walk alone without being bored.  No
long, uneventful stretches of bleak, wintry landscape, where nothing moves, not even the train
of thought.  No benumbed and self-centered trees holding out pathetic frozen branches for sympathy.
Impossible to be introspective here.  Fall into a brown or blue study and you are likely to
be run over.  Thought is brought to the surface by mental massage. No time to dwell upon your
beloved self.  So many more interesting things to think about.  And the changing scenes unfold
more rapidly than a moving-picture reel."

This sounds much more interesting than the country.  And it is more interesting, Broadway asking
nothing of a country lane for excitement. And back they go who live on excitement; while some
of us take this same excitement as the best of reasons for double windows and storm doors and
country life the year through.

You can think in the city, but it is in spite of the city. Gregariousness and individuality
do not abide together; nor is external excitement the cause or the concomitant of thought.
In fact this "mental massage" of the city is to real thinking about what a mustard-plaster
is to circulation--a counter-irritant.  The thinker is one who finds himself (quite impossible
on Broadway!); and then finds himself interesting--more interesting than Broadway--another
impossibility within the city limits.  Only in the country can he do that, in a wide and negative
environment of quiet, room, and isolation--necessary conditions for the enjoyment of one's
own mind. Thought is a country product and comes in to the city for distribution, as books
are gathered and distributed by libraries, but not written in libraries.  It is against the
wide, drab background of the country that thought most naturally reacts, thinking being only
the excitement of a man discovering himself, as he is compelled to do, where bending horizon
and arching sky shift as he shifts in all creation's constant endeavor to swing around and
center on him.  Nothing centers on him in the city, where he thinks by "mental massage"--through
the scalp with laying on of hands, as by benediction or shampoo.

But for the busy man, say of forty, are the hills of Hingham with their adventure possible?
Why, there is nothing ailing the man of forty except that he now is neither young nor old,
nor rich, the chances are; nor a dead failure either, but just an average man; yet he is one
of God's people, if the Philistines were (He brought them from Caphtor) and the Syrians (those
He brought from Kir).  The man of forty has a right to so much of the Promised Land as a hill
in Hingham.  But he is afraid to possess it because it is so far from work and friends and
lighted streets.  He is afraid of the dark and of going off to sit down upon a stump for converse
with himself.  He is afraid he won't get his work done.  If his work were planting beans, he
would get none planted surely while on the stump; but so he might be saved the ungracious task
of giving away his surplus beans to bean-ridden friends for the summer. A man, I believe, can
plant too many beans.  He might not finish the freshman themes either.  But when was the last
freshman theme ever done?  Finish them if he can, he has only baked the freshmen into sophomores,
and so emptied the ovens for another batch of dough.  He shall never put a crust on the last
freshman, and not much of a crust on the last sophomore either, the Almighty refusing to coöperate
with him in the baking.  Let him do the best he can, not the most he can, and quit for Hingham
and the hills where he can go out to a stump and sit down.

College students also are a part of that world which can be too much with us, cabbages, too,
if we are growing cabbages.  We don't do over-much, but we are over-busy.  We want too much.
Buy a little hill in Hingham, and even out here, unless you pray and go apart often to your
stump, your desire will be toward every hill in sight and the valleys between.

According to the deed my hill comprises "fourteen acres more or less" of an ancient glacier,
a fourteen-acre heap of unmitigated gravel, which now these almost fourteen years I have been
trying to clear of stones, picking, picking for a whole Stone Age, and planning daily to buy
the nine-acre ridge adjoining me which is gravelier than mine.  By actual count we dumped five
hundred cartloads of stones into the foundation of a porch when making over the house recently--and
still I am out in the garden picking, picking, living in the Stone Age still, and planning
to prolong the stay by nine acres more that are worse than these I now have, nine times worse
for stones!

I shall never cease picking stones, I presume, but perhaps I can get out a permanent injunction
against myself, to prevent my buying that neighboring gravel hill, and so find time to climb
my own and sit down among the beautiful moth-infested oak trees.

I do sit down, and I thrust my idle hands hard into my pockets to keep them from the Devil
who would have them out at the moths instantly--an evil job, killing moths, worse than picking
stones!

Nothing is more difficult to find anywhere than time to sit down with yourself, except the
ability to enjoy the time after finding it,--even here on a hill in Hingham, if the hill is
in woods.  There are foes to face in the city and floods to stem out here, but let no one try
to fight several acres of caterpillars.  When you see them coming, climb your stump and wait
on the Lord.  He is slow; and the caterpillars are horribly fast.  True.  Yet I say.  To your
stump and wait--and learn how restful a thing it is to sit down by faith.  For the town sprayer
is a vain thing.  The roof of green is riddled.  The rafters overhead reach out as naked as
in December.  Ruin looks through.  On sweep the devouring hosts in spite of arsenate of lead
and "wilt" disease and Calasoma beetles.  Nothing will avail; nothing but a new woodlot planted
with saplings that the caterpillars do not eat.  Sit still my soul, and know that when these
oak trees fall there will come up the fir tree and the pine tree and the shagbark, distasteful
to the worms; and they shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall
not be cut off.

This is good forestry, and good philosophy--a sure handling of both worms and soul.

But how hard to follow!  I would so like to help the Lord.  Not to do my own share only; but
to shoulder the Almighty's too, saying--

  "If it were done when 't is done, then 't were well
  It were done quickly";

and I up and do it.  But it does not stay done.  I had sprayed, creosoted, cut, trimmed, cemented,
only to see the trees die, until I was forced to rest upon the stump, when I saw what I had
been blind to before: that the pine trees were tipped with cones, and that there in the tops
were the red squirrels shucking and giving the winged seeds to the winds to sow; and that even
now up the wooded slope below me, where the first of the old oaks had perished, was climbing
a future grove of seedling pines.

The forests of Arden are not infested with gypsy moths, nor the woods of Heaven either, I suppose;
but the trees in the hills of Hingham are. And yet they are the trees of the Lord; the moths
are his also, and the caring for them.  I am caring for a few college freshmen and my soul.
I shall go forth to my work until the evening.  The Lord can take the night-shift; for it was
He who instituted the twilight, and it is He who must needs be responsible till the morning.

So here a-top my stump in the beleaguered woodlot I sit with idle hands, and no stars falling,
and the universe turning all alone!

To wake up at forty a factory hand! a floor-walker! a banker! a college professor! a man about
town or any other respectably successful, humdrum, square wooden peg-of-a-thing in a square
tight hole!  There is an evil, says the Preacher, which I have seen under the sun--the man
of about forty who has become moderately successful and automatic, but who has not, and now
knows he cannot, set the world on fire.  This is a vanity and it is an evil disease.

From running the universe at thirty the man of forty finds himself running with it, paced before,
behind, and beside, by other runners and by the very stars in their courses.  He has struck
the universal gait, a strong steady stride that will carry him to the finish, but not among
the medals.  This is an evil thing.  Forty is a dangerous age.  The wild race of twenty, the
staggering step of eighty, are full of peril, but not so deadly as the even, mechanical going
of forty; for youth has the dash in hand; old age has ceased to worry and is walking in; while
the man of forty is right in the middle of the run, grinding along on his second wind with
the cheering all ahead of him.

In fact, the man of forty finds himself half-way across the street with the baby carriage in
his hands, and touring cars in front of him, and limousines behind him, and the hand-of-the-law
staying and steadying him on his perilous course.

Life may be no busier at forty than at thirty, but it is certainly more expensive.  Work may
not be so hard, but the facts of life are a great deal harder, the hardest, barest of them
being the here-and-now of all things, the dead levelness of forty--an irrigated plain that
has no hill of vision, no valley of dream.  But it may have its hill in Hingham with a bit
of meadow down below.

Mullein Hill is the least of all hills, even with the added stump; but looking down through
the trees I can see the gray road, and an occasional touring car, like a dream, go by; and
off on the Blue Hills of Milton--higher hills than ours in Hingham--hangs a purple mist that
from our ridge seems the very robe and veil of vision.

The realities are near enough to me here crawling everywhere, indeed; but close as I am to
the flat earth I can yet look down at things--at the road and the passing cars; and off at
things--the hills and the distant horizon; and so I can escape for a time that level stare
into the face of things which sees them as things close and real, but seldom as life, far off
and whole.

Perhaps I have never seen life whole; I may need a throne and not a hill and a stump for that;
but here in the wideness of the open skies, in the sweet quiet, in the hush that often fills
these deep woods, I sometimes see life free, not free from men and things, but unencumbered,
coming to meet me out of the morning and passing on with me toward the sunset until, at times,
the stepping westward, the uneventful onwardness of life has

    ". . . seemed to be
  A kind of heavenly destiny"

and, even the back-and-forth of it, a divine thing.

This knowledge is too wonderful for me; I cannot keep fast hold of it; yet to know occasionally
that you are greater than your rhetoric, or your acres of stones, or your woods of worms, worms
that may destroy your trees though you spray, is to steady and establish your soul, and vastly
to comfort it!

To be greater than your possessions, than your accomplishments, than your desires--greater
than you know, than anybody at home knows or will admit!  So great that you can leave your
plough in the turret that you can leave the committees to meet, and the trees to fall, and
the sun to hurry on, while you take your seat upon a stump, assured from many a dismaying observation
that the trees will fall anyhow, that the sun will hasten on its course, and that the committees,
even the committees, will meet and do business whether you attend or not!

This is bed-rock fact, the broad and solid bottom for a cheerful philosophy.  To know that
they can get on without you (more knowledge than many ever attain!) is the beginning of wisdom;
and to learn that you can get on without them--at the close of the day, and out here on your
hill in Hingham--this is the end of understanding.

If I am no more than the shoes I stitch, or the lessons I peg, and the college can so calmly
move on without me, how small I am!  Let me hope that I am useful there, and useful as a citizen-at-large;
but I know that I am chiefly and utterly dispensable at large, everywhere at large, even in
Hingham.  But not here on my hilltop.  Here I am indispensable.  In the short shift from my
classroom, from chair to hill, from doing to being, I pass from a means into an end, from a
part in the scheme of things to the scheme of things itself.

Here stands my hill on the highway from dawn to dusk, and just where the bending walls of the
sky center and encircle it.  This is not only a large place, with room and verge enough; it
is also a chief place, where start the north and south and east and west, and the gray crooked
road over which I travel daily.

I can trace the run of the road from my stump on the hill, off to where it bends on the edge
of night for its returning and rest here.

  "Let me live in a house by the aide of the road,"

sings the poet; but as for me, after traveling all day let me come back to a house at the end
of the road--for in returning and rest shall a man be saved, in quietness and confidence shall
he find strength. Nowhere shall he find that quietness and confidence in larger measure than
here in the hills.  And where shall he return to more rest?

There are men whose souls are like these hills, simple, strong, quiet men who can heal and
restore; and there are books that help like the hills, simple elemental, large books; music,
and sleep, and prayer, and play are healing too; but none of these cure and fill one with a
quietness and confidence as deep as that from the hills, even from the little hills and the
small fields and the vast skies of Hingham; a confidence and joy in the earth, perhaps, rather
than in heaven, and yet in heaven too.

If it is not also a steadied thinking and a cleared seeing, it is at least a mental and moral
convalescence that one gets--out of the landscape, out of its largeness, sweetness and reality.
I am quickly conscious on the hills of space all about me--room for myself, room for the things
that crowd and clutter me; and as these arrange and set themselves in order, I am aware of
space within me, of freedom and wideness there, of things in order, of doors unlocked and windows
opened, through which I look out upon a new young world, new like the morning, young like the
seedling pines on the slope--young and new like my soul!

Now I can go back to my classroom.  Now I can read themes once more. Now I can gaze into the
round, moon-eyed face of youth and have faith--as if my chair were a stump, my classroom a
wooded hillside covered with young pines, seedlings of the Lord, and full of sap, and proof
against the worm.

Yet these are the same youth who yesterday wrote the "Autobiography of a Fountain Pen" and
"The Exhilarations of the Straw-Ride" and the essays on "The Beauties of Nature."  It is I
who am not the same.  I have been changed, renewed, having seen from my stump the face of eternal
youth in the freshmen pines marching up the hillside, in the young brook playing and pursuing
through the meadow, in the young winds over the trees, the young stars in the skies, the young
moon riding along the horizon

  "With the auld moon in her arm"--

youth immortal, and so, unburdened by its withered load of age.

I come down from the hill with a soul resurgent,--strong like the heave that overreaches the
sag of the sea,--and bold in my faith--to a lot of college students as the hope of the world!

From the stump in the woodlot I see not only the face of things but the course of things, that
they are moving past me, over me, and round and round me their fixed center--for the horizon
to bend about, for the sky to arch over, for the highways to start from, for every influence
and interest between Hingham and Heaven to focus on.

  "All things journey sun and moon
  Morning noon and afternoon,
  Night and all her stars,"--

and they all journey about me on my stump in the hilltop.

We love human nature; we love to get back to it in New York and Boston,--for a day, for six
months in the winter even,--but we need to get back to the hills at night.  We are a conventional,
gregarious, herding folk.  Let an American get rich and he builds a grand house in the city.
Let an Englishman get rich and he moves straight into the country--out to such a spot as Bradley
Hill in Hingham.

There are many of the city's glories and conveniences lacking here on Mullein Hill, but Mullein
Hill has some of the necessities that are lacking in the city--wide distances and silent places,
and woods and stumps where you can sit down and feel that you are greater than anything in
sight.  In the city the buildings are too vast; the people are too many.  You might feel greater
than any two or three persons there, perhaps, but not greater than nearly a million.

No matter how centered and serene I start from Hingham, a little way into Boston and I am lost.
First I begin to hurry (a thing unnecessary in Hingham) for everybody else is hurrying; then
I must get somewhere; everybody else is getting somewhere, getting everywhere.  For see them
in front of me and behind me, getting there ahead of me and coming after me to leave no room
for me when I shall arrive!  But when shall I and where shall I arrive?  And what shall I arrive
for?  And who am I that I would arrive?  I look around for the encircling horizon, and up for
the overarching sky, and in for the guiding purpose; but instead of a purpose I am hustled
forward by a crowd, and at the bottom of a street far down beneath such overhanging walls as
leave me but a slit of smoky sky.  I am in the hands of a force mightier than I, in the hands
of the police force at the street corners, and am carried across to the opposite curb through
a breaker that rolls in front of me again at the next crossing.  So I move on, by external
compulsion, knowing, as I move, by a kind of mental contagion, feeling by a sort of proxy,
and putting my trust everywhere in advertising and the police.

Thus I come, it may be, into the Public Library, "where is all the recorded wit of the world,
but none of the recording,"--where Shakespeare and Old Sleuth and Pansy look all alike and
as readable as the card catalogues, or the boy attendants, or the signs of the Zodiac in the
vestibule floor.

Who can read all these books?  Who wishes to read any of these books? They are too many--more
books in here than men on the street outside! And how dead they are in here, wedged side by
side in this vast sepulcher of human thought!

I move among them dully, the stir of the streets coming to me as the soughing of wind on the
desert or the wash of waves on a distant shore. Here I find a book of my own among the dead.
I read its inscription curiously.  I must have written it--when I was alive aeons ago, and
far from here.  But why did I?  For see the unread, the shelved, the numbered, the buried books!

Let me out to the street!  Dust we are, not books, and unto dust, good fertile soil, not paper
and ink, we shall return.  No more writing for me--but breathing and eating and jostling with
the good earthy people outside, laughing and loving and dying with them!

The sweet wind in Copley Square!  The sweet smell of gasoline!  The sweet scream of electric horns!

And how sweet--how fat and alive and friendly the old colored hack driver, standing there by
the stone post!  He has a number on his cap; he is catalogued somewhere, but not in the library.
Thank heaven he is no book, but just a good black human being.  I rush up and shake hands with
him.  He nearly falls into his cab with astonishment; but I must get hold of life again, and
he looks so real and removed from letters!

"Uncle!" I whisper, close in his ear, "have ye got it?  Quick--

  "'Cross me twice wid de raabbit foot--
  Dar's steppin' at de doo'!
  Cross me twice wid de raabbit foot--
  Dar's creakin' on de floo'!'"

He makes the passes, and I turn down Boylston Street, a living thing once more with face toward--the
hills of Hingham.

It is five o'clock, and a winter evening, and all the street pours forth to meet me--some of
them coming with me bound for Hingham, surely, as all of them are bound for a hill somewhere
and a home.

I love the city at this winter hour.  This home-hurrying crowd--its excitement of escape! its
eagerness and expectancy! its camaraderie! The arc-lights overhead glow and splutter with the
joy they see on the faces beneath them.

It is nearly half-past five as I turn into Winter Street.  Now the very stores are closing.
Work has ceased.  Drays and automobiles are gone. The two-wheeled fruit man is going from his
stand at the Subway entrance.  The street is filled from wall to wall with men and women, young
women and young men, fresher, more eager, more excited, more joyous even than the lesser crowd
of shoppers down Boylston Street. They don't notice me particularly.  No one notices any one
particularly, for the lights overhead see us all, and we all understand as we cross and dodge
and lockstep and bump and jostle through this deep narrow place of closing doors toward home.
Then the last rush at the station, that nightly baptism into human brotherhood as we plunge
into the crowd and are carried through the gates and into our train--which is speeding far
out through the dark before I begin to come to myself--find myself leaving the others, separating,
individualizing, taking on definite shape and my own being.  The train is grinding in at my
station, and I drop out along the track in the dark alone.

I gather my bundles and hug them to me, feeling not the bread and bananas, but only the sense
of possession, as I step off down the track.  Here is my automobile.  Two miles of back-country
road lie before me.  I drive slowly, the stars overhead, but not far away, and very close about
me the deep darkness of the woods--and silence and space and shapes invisible, and voices inaudible
as yet to my city-dinned ears and staring eyes.  But sight returns, and hearing, till soon
my very fingers, feeling far into the dark, begin to see and hear.

And now I near the hill: these are my woods; this is my gravel bank; that my meadow, my wall,
my postbox, and up yonder among the trees shines my light.  They are expecting me, She, and
the boys, and the dog, and the blazing fire, the very trees up there, and the watching stars.

How the car takes the hill--as if up were down, and wheels were wings, and just as if the boys
and the dog and the dinner and the fire were all waiting for it!  As they are, of course, it
and me.  I open up the throttle, I jam the shrieking whistle, and rip around the bend in the
middle of the hill,--puppy yelping down to meet me.  The noise we make as the lights flash
on, as the big door rolls back, and we come to our nightly standstill inside the boy-filled
barn!  They drag me from the wheel--puppy yanking at my trouser leg; they pounce upon my bundles;
they hustle me toward the house, where, in the lighted doorway more welcome waits me--and questions,
batteries of them, even puppy joining the attack!

Who would have believed I had seen and done all this,--had any such adventurous trip,--lived
any such significant day,--catching my regular 8.35 train as I did!

But we get through the dinner and some of the talk and then the out-loud reading before the
fire; then while she is tucking the children in bed, I go out to see that all is well about
the barn.

How the night has deepened since my return!  No wind stirs.  The hill-crest blazes with the
light of the stars.  Such an earth and sky! I lock the barn, and crossing the field, climb
the ridge to the stump. The bare woods are dark with shadow and deep with the silence of the
night.  A train rumbles somewhere in the distance, then the silence and space reach off through
the shadows, infinitely far off down the hillside; and the stars gather in the tops of the trees.

II

THE OPEN FIRE

It is a January night.

  ". . . . . . . Enclosed
  From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old,"

we sit with our book before the fire.  Outside in the night ghostly shapes pass by, ghostly
faces press against the window, and at the corners of the house ghostly voices pause for parley,
muttering thickly through the swirl and smother of the snow.  Inside burns the fire, kindling
into glorious pink and white peonies on the nearest wall and glowing warm and sweet on her
face as she reads.  The children are in bed.  She is reading aloud to me:

"'I wish the good old times would come again,' she said, 'when we were not quite so rich. 
I do not mean that I want to be poor, but there was a middle state'--so she was pleased to
ramble on--'in which, I am sure, we were a great deal happier.'"

Her eyes left the familiar page, wandering far away beyond the fire.

"Is it so hard to bear up under two thousand five hundred a year?" I asked.

The gleam of the fire, or perhaps a fancy out of the far-beyond, lighted her eyes as she answered,

"We began on four hundred and fifty a year; and we were perfectly--"

"Yes, but you forget the parsonage; that was rent free!"

"Four hundred and fifty with rent free--and we had everything we could--"

"You forget again that we had n't even one of our four boys."

Her gaze rested tenderly upon the little chairs between her and the fire, just where the boys
had left them at the end of their listening an hour before.

"If you had allowed me," she went on, "I was going to say how glad we ought to be that we are
not quite so rich as--"

"We should like to be?" I questioned.

"'A purchase'"--she was reading again--"'is but a purchase, now that you have money enough
and to spare.  Formerly it used to be a triumph.

"Truly," I replied, trying hard to hide a note of eagerness in my voice, for I had kept my
battery masked these many months, "only Lamb wanted an old folio, whereas we need a new car.
I have driven that old machine for five years and it was second-hand to begin with."

I watched for the effect of the shot, but evidently I had not got the range, for she was saying.

"Is there a sweeter bit in all of 'Elia' than this, do you think"?

She had paused again.  To know when to pause! how to make the most of your author! to draw
out the linked sweetness of a passage to its longest--there reads your loving reader!

"You see," laying her hand on mine, "old books and old friends are best, and I should think
you had really rather have a nice safe old car than any new one.  Thieves don't take old cars,
as you know.  And you can't insure them, that's a comfort!  And cars don't skid and collide
just because they are old, do they?  And you never have to scold the children about the paint
and--and the old thing does go--what do you think Lamb would say about old cars?"

"Lamb be hanged on old cars!" and I sent the sparks flying with a fresh stick.

"Well, then let's hear the rest of him on 'Old China.'"  And so she read, while the fire burned,
and outside swept the winter storm.

I have a weakness for out-loud reading and Lamb, and a peculiar joy in wood fires when the
nights are dark and snowy.  My mind is not, after all, much set on automobiles then; there
is such a difference between a wild January night on Mullein Hill and an automobile show--or
any other show.  If St. Bernard of Cluny had been an American and not a monk, I think Jerusalem
the Golden might very likely have been a quiet little town like Hingham, all black with a winter
night and lighted for the Saint with a single open fire.  Anyhow I cannot imagine the mansions
of the Celestial City without fireplaces.  I don't know how the equatorial people do; I have
never lived on the equator, and I have no desire to--nor in any other place where it is too
hot for a fireplace, or where wood is so scarce that one is obliged to substitute a gas-log.
I wish I could build an open hearth into every lowly home and give every man who loves out-loud
reading a copy of Lamb and sticks enough for a fire.  I wish--is it futile to wish that besides
the fireplace and the sticks I might add a great many more winter evenings to the round of
the year?  I would leave the days as they are in their beautiful and endless variety, but the
long, shut-in winter evenings

  "When young and old in circle
  About the firebrands close--"

these I would multiply, taking them away from June to give to January, could I supply the fire
and the boys and the books and the reader to go with them.

And I often wonder if more men might not supply these things for themselves?  There are January
nights for all, and space enough outside of city and suburb for simple firesides; books enough
also; yes, and readers-aloud if they are given the chance.  But the boys are hard to get. 
They might even come girls.  Well, what is the difference, anyway?  Suppose mine had been dear
things with ribbons in their hair--not these four, but four more?  Then all the glowing circle
about the fireplace had been filled, the chain complete, a link of fine gold for every link
of steel!  Ah! the cat hath nine lives, as Phisologus saith; but a man hath as many lives as
he hath sons, with two lives besides for every daughter.  So it must always seem to me when
I remember the precious thing that vanished from me before I could even lay her in her mother's
arms.  She would have been, I think, a full head taller than the oldest boy, and wiser than
all four of the boys, being a girl.

The real needs of life are few, and to be had by most men, even though they include children
and an automobile.  Second-hand cars are very cheap, and the world seems full of orphans--how
many orphans now!  It is n't a question of getting the things; the question is, What are the
necessary things?

First, I say, a fireplace.  A man does well to build his fireplace first instead of the garage.
Better than a roof over one's head is a fire at one's feet; for what is there deadlier than
the chill of a fireless house?  The fireplace first, unless indeed he have the chance, as I
had when a boy, to get him a pair of tongs.

The first piece of household furniture I ever purchased was a pair of old tongs.  I was a lad
in my teens.  "Five--five--five--five--v-v-v-ve will you make it ten?" I heard the auctioneer
cry as I passed the front gate.  He held a pair of brass-headed hearth tongs above his head,
waving them wildly at the unresponsive bidders.

"Will you make it ten?" he yelled at me as the last comer.

"Ten," I answered, a need for fire tongs, that blistering July day, suddenly overcoming me.

"And sold for ten cents to the boy in the gate," shouted the auctioneer.  "Will somebody throw
in the fireplace to go with them!"

I took my tongs rather sheepishly, I fear, rather helplessly, and got back through the gate,
for I was on foot and several miles from home. I trudged on for home carrying those tongs with
me all the way, not knowing why, not wishing to throw them into the briers for they were very
old and full of story, and I--was very young and full of--I cannot tell, remembering what little
boys are made of.  And now here they lean against the hearth, that very pair.  I packed them
in the bottom of my trunk when I started for college; I saved them through the years when our
open fire was a "base-burner," and then a gas-radiator in a city flat.  Moved, preserved, "married"
these many years, they stand at last where the boy must have dreamed them standing--that hot
July day, how long, long ago!

But why should a boy have dreamed such dreams?  And what was it in a married old pair of brass-headed
hearth tongs that a boy in his teens should have bought them at auction and then have carried
them to college with him, rattling about on the bottom of his trunk?  For it was not an over-packed
trunk.  There were the tongs on the bottom and a thirty-cent edition of "The Natural History
of Selborne" on the top--that is all.  That is all the boy remembers.  These two things, at
least, are all that now remain out of the trunkful he started with from home--the tongs for
sentiment, and for friendship the book.

"Are you listening?" she asks, looking up to see if I have gone to sleep.

"Yes, I 'm listening."

"And dreaming?"

"Yes, dreaming a little, too,--of you, dear, and the tongs there, and the boys upstairs, and
the storm outside, and the fire, and of this sweet room,--an old, old dream that I had years
and years ago,--all come true, and more than true."

She slipped her hand into mine.

"Shall I go on?"

"Yes, go on, please, and I will listen--and, if you don't mind, dream a little, too, perhaps."

There is something in the fire and the rise and fall of her voice, something so infinitely
soothing in its tones, and in Lamb, and in such a night as this--so vast and fearful, but so
futile in its bitter sweep about the fire--that while one listens one must really dream too.

III

THE ICE CROP

The ice-cart with its weighty tongs never climbs our Hill, yet the icechest does not lack its
clear blue cake of frozen February.  We gather our own ice as we gather our own hay and apples.
The small ice-house under the trees has just been packed with eighteen tons of "black" ice,
sawed and split into even blocks, tier on tier, the harvest of the curing cold, as loft and
cellar are still filled with crops made in the summer's curing heat.  So do the seasons overlap
and run together!  So do they complement and multiply each other!  Like the star-dust of Saturn
they belt our fourteen-acre planet, not with three rings, nor four, but with twelve, a ring
for every month, a girdle of twelve shining circles running round the year--the tinkling ice
of February in the goblet of October!--the apples of October red and ripe on what might have
been April's empty platter!

He who sows the seasons and gathers the months into ice-house and barn lives not from sunup
to sundown, revolving with the hands of the clock, but, heliocentric, makes a daily circuit
clear around the sun--the smell of mint in the hay-mow, a reminder of noontime passed; the
prospect of winter in the growing garden, a gentle warning of night coming on.  Twelve times
one are twelve--by so many times are months and meanings and values multiplied for him whose
fourteen acres bring forth abundantly--provided that the barns on the place be kept safely small.

Big barns are an abomination unto the Lord, and without place on a wise man's estate.  As birds
have nests, and foxes dens, so may any man have a place to lay his head, with a mansion prepared
in the sky for his soul.

Big barns are as foolish for the ice-man as for others.  The barns of an ice-man must needs
be large, yet they are over-large if he can say to his soul: "Soul, thou hast much ice laid
up for many days; eat, drink, and be merry among the cakes"--and when the autumn comes he still
has a barn full of solid cemented cakes that must be sawed out! No soul can be merry long on
ice--nor on sugar, nor shoes, nor stocks, nor hay, nor anything of that sort in great quantities.
He who builds great barns for ice, builds a refrigerator for his soul.  Ice must never become
a man's only crop; for then winter means nothing but ice; and the year nothing but winter;
for the year's never at the spring for him, but always at February or when the ice is making
and the mercury is down to zero.

As I have already intimated, a safe kind of ice-house is one like mine, that cannot hold more
than eighteen tons--a year's supply (shrinkage and Sunday ice-cream and other extras provided
for).  Such an ice-house is not only an ice-house, it is also an act of faith, an avowal of
confidence in the stability of the frame of things, and in their orderly continuance.  Another
winter will come, it proclaims, when the ponds will be pretty sure to freeze.  If they don't
freeze, and never do again--well, who has an ice-house big enough in that event?

My ice-house is one of life's satisfactions; not architecturally, of course, for there has
been no great development yet in ice-house lines, and this one was home-done; it is a satisfaction
morally, being one thing I have done that is neither more nor less.  I have the big-barn weakness--the
desire for ice--for ice to melt--as if I were no wiser than the ice-man!  I builded bigger
than I knew when I put the stone porches about the dwelling-house, consulting in my pride the
architect first instead of the town assessors.  I took no counsel of pride in building the
ice-house, nor of fear, nor of my love of ice.  I said: "I will build me a house to carry a
year's supply of ice and no more, however the price of ice may rise, and even with the risk
of facing seven hot and iceless years.  I have laid up enough things among the moths and rust.
Ice against the rainy day I will provide, but ice for my children and my children's children,
ice for a possible cosmic reversal that might twist the equator over the poles, I will not
provide for.  Nor will I go into the ice business."

Nor did I!  And I say the building of that ice-house has been an immense satisfaction to me.
I entertain my due share of

  "Gorgons, and hydras and chimaeras dire";

but a cataclysm of the proportions mentioned above would as likely as not bring on another
Ice Age, or indeed--

  ". . . run back and fetch the Age of Gold."

To have an ice-house, and yourself escape cold storage--that seems to me the thing.

I can fill the house in a single day, and so trade a day for a year; or is it not rather that
I crowd a year into a day?  Such days are possible.  It is not any day that I can fill the
ice-house.  Ice-day is a chosen, dedicated day, one of the year's high festivals, the Day of
First Fruits, the ice crop being the year's earliest harvest.  Hay is made when the sun shines,
a condition sometimes slow in coming; but ice of the right quality and thickness, with roads
right, and sky right for harvesting, requires a conjunction of right conditions so difficult
as to make a good ice-day as rare as a day in June.  June! why, June knows no such glorious
weather as that attending the harvest of the ice.

This year it fell early in February--rather late in the season; so late, in fact, that, in
spite of my faith in winter, I began to grow anxious--something no one on a hill in Hingham
need ever do.  Since New Year's Day unseasonable weather had prevailed: shifty winds, uncertain
skies, rain and snow and sleet--that soft, spongy weather when the ice soaks and grows soggy.
By the middle of January what little ice there had been in the pond was gone, and the ice-house
was still empty.

Toward the end of the month, however, the skies cleared, the wind settled steadily into the
north, and a great quiet began to deepen over the fields, a quiet that at night grew so tense
you seemed to hear the close-glittering heavens snapping with the light of the stars. Everything
seemed charged with electric cold; the rich soil of the garden struck fire like flint beneath
your feet; the tall hillside pines, as stiff as masts of steel, would suddenly crack in the
brittle silence, with a sharp report; and at intervals throughout the taut boreal night you
could hear a hollow rumbling running down the length of the pond--the ice being split with
the wide iron wedge of the cold.

Down and down for three days slipped the silver column in the thermometer until at eight o'clock
on the fourth day it stood just above zero.  Cold?  It was splendid weather! with four inches
of ice on the little pond behind the ridge, glare ice, black as you looked across it, but like
a pane of plate glass as you peered into it at the stirless bottom below; smooth glare ice
untouched by the wing of the wind or by even the circling runner of the skater-snow.  Another
day and night like this and the solid square-edged blocks could come in.

I looked at the glass late that night and found it still falling.  I went on out beneath the
stars.  It may have been the tightened telephone wires overhead, or the frozen ground beneath
me ringing with the distant tread of the coming north wind, yet over these, and with them,
I heard the singing of a voiceless song, no louder than the winging hum of bees, but vaster--the
earth and air responding to a starry lyre as some Aeolian harper, sweeping through the silvery
spaces of the night, brushed the strings with her robes of jeweled cold.

The mercury stood at zero by one o'clock.  A biting wind had risen and blew all the next day.
Eight inches of ice by this time.  One night more and the crop would be ripe.  And it was ripe.

I was out before the sun, tramping down to the pond with pike and saw, the team not likely
to be along for half an hour yet, the breaking of the marvelous day all mine.  Like apples
of gold in baskets of silver were the snow-covered ridges in the light of the slow-coming dawn.
The wind had fallen, but the chill seemed the more intense, so silently it took hold.  My breath
hung about me in little gray clouds, covering my face, and even my coat, with rime.  As the
hurt passed from my fingers, my eyebrows seemed to become detached, my cheeks shrunk, my flesh
suddenly free of cumbering clothes.  But in half a minute the rapid red blood would come beating
back, spreading over me and out from me, with the pain, and then the glow, of life, of perfect
life that seemed itself to feed upon the consuming cold.

No other living thing was yet abroad, no stir or sound except the tinkling of tiny bells all
about me that were set to swinging as I moved along.  The crusted snow was strewn with them;
every twig was hung, and every pearl-bent grass blade.  Then off through the woods rang the
chime of louder bells, sleigh bells; then the shrill squeal of iron runners over dry snow;
then the broken voices of men; and soon through the winding wood road came the horses, their
bay coats white, as all things were, with the glittering dust of the hoar frost.

It was beautiful work.  The mid-afternoon found us in the thick of a whirling storm, the grip
of the cold relaxed, the woods abloom with the clinging snow.  But the crop was nearly in.
High and higher rose the cold blue cakes within the ice-house doors until they touched the
rafter plate.

It was hard work.  The horses pulled hard; the men swore hard, now and again, and worked harder
than they swore.  They were rough, simple men, crude and elemental like their labor.  It was
elemental work--filling a house with ice, three hundred-pound cakes of clean, clear ice, cut
from the pond, skidded into the pungs, and hauled through the woods all white, and under a
sky all gray, with softly-falling snow.  They earned their penny; and I earned my penny, and
I got it, though I asked only the wages of going on from dawn to dark, down the crystal hours
of the day.

IV

SEED CATALOGUES

"The new number of the 'Atlantic' came to-day," She said, stopping by the table.  "It has your
essay in it."

"Yes?" I replied, only half hearing.

"You have seen it, then?"

"No"--still absorbed in my reading.

"What is it you are so interested in?" she inquired, laying down the new magazine.

"A seed catalogue."

"More seed catalogues!  Why, you read nothing else last night."

"But this is a new one," I replied, "and I declare I never saw turnips that could touch this
improved strain here.  I am going to plant a lot of them this year."

"How many seed catalogues have you had this spring?"

"Only six, so far."

"And you plant your earliest seeds--"

"In April, the middle of April, though I may be able to get my first peas in by the last of
March.  You see peas"--she was backing away--"this new Antarctic Pea--will stand a lot of cold;
but beans--do come here, and look at these Improved Kentucky Wonder Pole Beans!" holding out
the wonderfully lithographed page toward her.  But she backed still farther away, and, putting
her hands behind her, looked at me instead, and very solemnly.

I suppose every man comes to know that unaccountable expression in his wife's eyes soon or
late: a sad, baffled expression, detached, remote, as of things seen darkly, or descried afar
off; an expression which leaves you feeling that you are afar off,--discernible, but infinitely
dwindled.  Two minds with but a single thought--so you start; but soon she finds, or late,
that as the heavens are high above the earth, so are some of your thoughts above her thoughts.
She cannot follow.  On the brink she stands and sees you, through the starry spaces, drift
from her ken in your fleet of--seed catalogues.

I have never been able to explain to her the seed catalogue.  She is as fond of vegetables
as I, and neither of us cares much for turnips--nor for carrots, nor parsnips either, when
it comes to that, our two hearts at the table beating happily as one.  Born in the country,
she inherited a love of the garden, but a feminine garden, the garden parvus, minor, minimus--so
many cut-worms long, so many cut-worms wide.  I love a garden of size, a garden that one cut-worm
cannot sweep down upon in the night.

For years I have wanted to be a farmer, but there in the furrow ahead of me, like a bird on
its nest, she has sat with her knitting; and when I speak of loving long rows to hoe, she smiles
and says, "For the boys to hoe."  Her unit of garden measure is a meal--so many beet seeds
for a meal; so many meals for a row, with never two rows of anything, with hardly a full-length
row of anything, and with all the rows of different lengths, as if gardening were a sort of
geometry or a problem in arithmetic, figuring your vegetable with the meal for a common divisor--how
many times it will go into all your rows without leaving a remainder!

Now I go by the seed catalogue, planting, not after the dish, as if my only vision were a garden
peeled and in the pot, but after the Bush., Peck, Qt., Pt., Lb., Oz., Pkg.,--so many pounds
to the acre, instead of so many seeds to the meal.

And I have tried to show her that gardening is something of a risk, attended by chance, and
no such exact science as dressmaking; that you cannot sow seeds as you can sew buttons; that
the seed-man has no machine for putting sure-sprout-humps into each of his minute wares as
the hook-and-eye-man has; that with all wisdom and understanding one could do no better than
to buy (as I am careful to do) out of that catalogue whose title reads "Honest Seeds"; and
that even the Sower in Holy Writ allowed somewhat for stony places and other inherent hazards
of planting time.

But she follows only afar off, affirming the primary meaning of that parable to be plainly
set forth in the context, while the secondary meaning pointeth out the folly of sowing seed
anywhere save on good ground--which seemed to be only about one quarter of the area in the
parable that was planted; and that anyhow, seed catalogues, especially those in colors, designed
as they are to catch the simple-minded and unwary, need to be looked into by the post-office
authorities and if possible kept from all city people, and from college professors in particular.

She is entirely right about the college professors.  Her understanding is based upon years
of observation and the patient cooking of uncounted pots of beans.

I confess to a weakness for gardening and no sense at all of proportion in vegetables.  I can
no more resist a seed catalogue than a toper can his cup.  There is no game, no form of exercise,
to compare for a moment in my mind with having a row of young growing things in a patch of
mellow soil; no possession so sure, so worth while, so interesting as a piece of land.  The
smell of it, the feel of it, the call of it, intoxicate me.  The rows are never long enough,
nor the hours, nor the muscles strong enough either, when there is hoeing to do.

Why should she not take it as a solemn duty to save me from the hoe? Man is an immoderate animal,
especially in the spring when the doors of his classroom are about to open for him into the
wide and greening fields.  There is only one place to live,--here in the hills of Hingham;
and there is nothing better to do here or anywhere, than the hoeing, or the milking, or the
feeding of the hens.

A professor in the small college of Slimsalaryville tells in a recent magazine of his long
hair and no dress suit, and of his wife's doing the washing in order that they might have bread
and the "Eugenic Review" on a salary of twelve hundred dollars a year.  It is a sad story,
in the midst of which he exclaims: "I may even get to the place where I can spare time (italics
mine) to keep chickens or a cow, and that would help immensely; but I am so constituted that
chickens or a cow would certainly cripple my work."  How cripple it?  Is n't it his work to
teach?  Far from it.  "Let there be light," he says at the end of the essay, is his work, and
he adds that he has been so busy with it that he is on the verge of a nervous break-down. 
Of course he is.  Who would n't be with that job?  And of course he has n't a constitution
for chickens and a cow.  But neither does he seem to have constitution enough for the light-giving
either, being ready to collapse from his continuous shining.

But isn't this the case with many of us?  Aren't we overworking--doing our own simple job of
teaching and, besides that, taking upon ourselves the Lord's work of letting there be light?

I have come to the conclusion that there might not be any less light were the Lord allowed
to do his own shining, and that probably there might be quite as good teaching if the teacher
stuck humbly to his desk, and after school kept chickens and a cow.  The egg-money and cream
"would help immensely," even the Professor admits, the Professor's wife fully concurring no doubt.

Don't we all take ourselves a little seriously--we college professors and others?  As if the
Lord could not continue to look after his light, if we looked after our students!  It is only
in these last years that I have learned that I can go forth unto my work and to my labor until
the evening, quitting then, and getting home in time to feed the chickens and milk the cow.
I am a professional man, and I dwell in the midst of professional men, all of whom are inclined
to help the Lord out by working after dark--all of whom are really in dire constitutional need
of the early roosting chickens and the quiet, ruminating cow.

To walk humbly with the hens, that's the thing--after the classes are dismissed and the office
closed.  To get out of the city, away from books, and theories, and students, and patients,
and clients, and customers--back to real things, simple, restful, healthful things for body
and soul, homely domestic things that lay eggs at 70 cents per dozen, and make butter at $2.25
the 5-pound box!  As for me, this does "help immensely," affording me all necessary hair-cuts
(I don't want the "Eugenic Review"), and allowing Her to send the family washing (except the
flannels) to the laundry.

Instead of crippling normal man's normal work, country living (chickens and a cow) will prevent
his work from crippling him--keeping him a little from his students and thus saving him from
too much teaching; keeping him from reading the "Eugenic Review" and thus saving him from too
much learning; curing him, in short, of his "constitution" that is bound to come to some sort
of a collapse unless rested and saved by chickens and a cow.

"By not too many chickens," she would add; and there is no one to match her with a chicken--fried,
stewed, or turned into pie.

The hens are no longer mine, the boys having taken them over; but the gardening I can't give
up, nor the seed catalogues.

The one in my hands was exceptionally radiant, and exceptionally full of Novelties and Specialties
for the New Year, among them being an extraordinary new pole bean--an Improved Kentucky Wonder.
She had backed away, as I have said, and instead of looking at the page of beans, looked solemnly
at me; then with something sorrowful, something somewhat Sunday-like in her voice, an echo,
I presume, of lessons in the Catechism, she asked me--

"Who makes you plant beans?"

"My dear," I began, "I--"

"How many meals of pole beans did we eat last summer?"

"I--don't--re--"

"Three--just three," she answered.  "And I think you must remember how many of that row of
poles we picked?"

"Why, yes, I--"

"Three--just three out of thirty poles!  Now, do you think you remember how many bushels of
those beans went utterly unpicked?"

I was visibly weakening by this time.

"Three--do you think?"

"Multiply that three by three-times-three!  And now tell me--"

But this was too much.

"My dear," I protested, "I recollect exactly.  It was--"

"No, I don't believe you do.  I cannot trust you at all with beans. But I should like to know
why you plant ten or twelve kinds of beans when the only kind we like are limas!"

"Why--the--catalogue advises--"

"Yes, the catalogue advises--"

"You don't seem to understand, my dear, that--"

"Now, why don't I understand?"

I paused.  This is always a hard question, and peculiarly hard as the end of a series, and
on a topic as difficult as beans.  I don't know beans.  There is little or nothing about beans
in the history of philosophy or in poetry.  Thoreau says that when he was hoeing his beans
it was not beans that he hoed nor he that hoed beans--which was the only saying that came to
mind at the moment, and under the circumstances did not seem to help me much.

"Well," I replied, fumbling among my stock of ready-made reasons, "I--really--don't--know exactly
why you don't understand.  Indeed, I really don't know--that I exactly understand.  Everything
is full of things that even I can't understand--how to explain my tendency to plant all kinds
of beans, for instance; or my 'weakness,' as you call it, for seed catalogues; or--"

She opened her magazine, and I hastened to get the stool for her feet. As I adjusted the light
for her she said:--

"Let me remind you that this is the night of the annual banquet of your Swampatalk Club; you
don't intend to forego that famous roast beef for the seed catalogues?"

"I did n't intend to, but I must say that literature like this is enough to make a man a vegetarian.
Look at that page for an old-fashioned New England Boiled Dinner!  Such carrots.  Really they
look good enough to eat.  I think I 'll plant some of those improved carrots; and some of these
parsnips; and some--"

"You had better go get ready," she said, "and please put that big stick on the fire for me,"
drawing the lamp toward her, as she spoke, so that all of its green-shaded light fell over
her--over the silver in her hair, with its red rose; over the pink and lacy thing that wrapped
her from her sweet throat to the silver stars on her slippers.

"I'm not going to that Club!" I said.  "I have talked myself for three hours to-day, attended
two conferences, and listened to one address. There were three different societies for the
general improving of things that met at the University halls to-day with big speakers from
the ends of the earth.  To-morrow night I address The First Century Club in the city after
a dinner with the New England Teachers of English Monthly Luncheon Club--and I would like to
know what we came out here in the woods for, anyhow?"

"If you are going--" She was speaking calmly.

"Going where?" I replied, picking up the seed catalogues to make room for myself on the couch.
"Please look at this pumpkin!  Think of what a jack-o'-lantern it would make for the boys!
I am going to plant--"

"You 'll be cold," she said, rising and drawing a steamer rug up over me; then laying the open
magazine across my shoulders while giving the pillow a motherly pull, she added, with a sigh
of contentment:--

"Perhaps, if it had n't been for me, you might have been a great success with pumpkins or pigs--I
don't know."

V

THE DUSTLESS-DUSTER

There are beaters, brooms and Bissell's Sweepers; there are dry-mops, turkey-wings, whisks,
and vacuum-cleaners; there are--but no matter. Whatever other things there are, and however
many of them in the closet, the whole dust-raising kit is incomplete without the Dustless-Duster.

For the Dustless-Duster is final, absolute.  What can be added to, or taken away from, a Dustless-Duster?
A broom is only a broom, even a new broom.  Its sphere is limited; its work is partial.  Dampened
and held persistently down by the most expert of sweepers, the broom still leaves something
for the Dustless-Duster to do.  But the Dustless-Duster leaves nothing for anything to do.
The dusting is done.

Because there are many who dust, and because they have searched in vain for a dustless-duster,
I should like to say that the Dustless-Duster can be bought at department stores, at those
that have a full line of departments--at any department store, in fact; for the Dustless-Duster
department is the largest of all the departments, whatever the store. Ask for it of your jeweler,
grocer, milliner.  Ask for "The Ideal," "The Universal," "The Indispensable," of any man with
anything to sell or preach or teach, and you shall have it--the perfect thing which you have
spent life looking for; which you have thought so often to have, but found as often that you
had not.  You shall have it.  I have it. One hangs, rather, in the kitchen on the clothes-dryer.

And one (more than one) hangs in the kitchen closet, and in the cellar, and in the attic. 
I have often brought it home, for my search has been diligent since a certain day, years ago,--a
"Commencement Day" at the Institute.

I had never attended a Commencement exercise before; I had never been in an opera house before;
and the painted light through the roof of windows high overhead, the strains of the orchestra
from far below me, the banks of broad-leaved palms, the colors, the odors, the confusion of
flowers and white frocks, were strangely thrilling.  Nothing had ever happened to me in the
woods like this: the exaltation, the depression, the thrill of joy, the throb of pain, the
awakening, the wonder, the purpose, and the longing!  It was all a dream--all but the form
and the face of one girl graduate, and the title of her essay, "The Real and the Ideal."

I do not know what large and lofty sentiments she uttered; I only remember the way she looked
them.  I did not hear the words she read; but I still feel the absolute fitness of her theme--how
real her simple white frock, her radiant face, her dark hair!  And how ideal!

I had seen perfection.  Here was the absolute, the final, the ideal, the indispensable!  And
I was fourteen!  Now I am past forty; and upon the kitchen clothes-dryer hangs the Dustless-Duster.

No, I have not lost the vision.  The daughter of that girl, the image of her mother, slipped
into my classroom the other day.  Nor have I faltered in the quest.  The search goes on, and
must go on; for however often I get it, only to cast it aside, the indispensable, the ultimate,
must continue to be indispensable and ultimate, until, some day--

What matters how many times I have had it, to discover every time that it is only a piece of
cheesecloth, ordinary cheesecloth, dyed black and stamped with red letters?  The search must
go on, notwithstanding the clutter in the kitchen closet.  The cellar is crowded with Dustless-Dusters,
too; the garret is stuffed with them.  There is little else besides them anywhere in the house.
And this was an empty house when I moved into it, a few years ago.

As I moved in, an old man moved out, back to the city whence a few years before he had come;
and he took back with him twelve two-horse wagon-loads of Dustless-Dusters.  He had spent a
long life collecting them, and now, having gathered all there were in the country, he was going
back to the city, in a last pathetic, a last heroic, effort to find the one Dustless-Duster more.

It was the old man's twelve two-horse loads that were pathetic.  There were many sorts of things
in those twelve loads, of many lands, of many dates, but all of one stamp.  The mark was sometimes
hard to find, corroded sometimes nearly past deciphering, yet never quite gone.  The red letters
were indelible on every piece, from the gross of antique candle-moulds (against the kerosene's
giving out) to an ancient coffin-plate, far oxidized, and engraved "Jones," which, the old
man said, as he pried it off the side of the barn, "might come in handy any day."

The old man has since died and been laid to rest.  Upon his coffin was set a new silver plate,
engraved simply and truthfully, "Brown."

We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain, says Holy Writ, that we can carry nothing
out.  But it is also certain that we shall attempt to carry out, or try to find as soon as
we are out, a Dustless-Duster.  For we did bring something with us into this world, losing
it temporarily, to be forever losing and finding it; and when we go into another world, will
it not be to carry the thing with us there, or to continue there our eternal search for it?
We are not so certain of carrying nothing out of this world, but we are certain of leaving
many things behind.

Among those that I shall leave behind me is The Perfect Automatic Carpet-Layer.  But I did
not buy that.  She did.  It was one of the first of our perfections.

We have more now.  I knew as I entered the house that night that something had happened; that
the hope of the early dawn had died, for some cause, with the dusk.  The trouble showed in
her eyes: mingled doubt, chagrin, self-accusation, self-defense, defeat--familiar symptoms.
She had seen something, something perfect, and had bought it.

I knew the look well, and the feelings all too well, and said nothing. The harpooned beluga will
accomplish off at abounding acceleration boring in his deathwatch the assailant's baiter which
flies over the face of the water, baking with the boss acclamation of the monster's tail. Soon
the baptize is red for anniversary beluga sheds eight or ten gallons of blood. Back he is annoyed
the baiter is fatigued in afterpiece by the braiding attached to
the animal.

As befalling offers the extra is acclimated and, apprenticed home
by a able hand, it sometimes goes bright through the body.

A accomplished man will bound bang some basic spot; contrarily the
beluga struggles long.

"Picture if possible," says the AbbÃ©, "the action of the beluga coursing
back a hundred of them are in the weir, back twenty-five or thirty
men are advancing them, back bristles or six boats abject by the creatures
are ploughing the amid amnion in every direction, back the spears
are hurled from all abandon and the men are covered with the claret
which gushes out in streams.

Some years ago the cartage of a casual steamer from Europe were assemblage
of such a arena and showed their agog absorption by battlefront a
blast of cannon."

When the belugas accept been dead the abutting assignment is to get them to shore. The assignment
charge be done bound for the abutting course will stop all assignment
and may ambit the animals away.

Horses are brought and the bodies are abject aground or partly floated
with the aid of the ascent tide.

The assignment of acid up and baking follows immediately.

Workmen with continued knives booty off the bark and abstracted the blab from the flesh. The
AbbÃ© Casgrain describes the action in detail. In the end the blab is cut up into baby pieces
and above in huge caldrons. The poor never abort to appear for their allotment of the bolt and,
with accepted charity, the Aggregation accustomed on the operations
never accelerate them abroad empty.

"The share-holders" says the AbbÃ© Casgrain, "are assertive that the success of their labours
depends aloft the ability which they accomplish to God, and their generosity claim His benediction,"
Many a citizen goes home with a accumulation of blab in his pot or absorbed to the end of a stout
branch.

The fishery is old and has been actual profitable. La Potherie describes the industry as it existed
at Kamouraska in 1701: that at RiviÃ¨re Ouelle is begin in 1707 and it remained in the easily of
the brood of the aboriginal promoters until, in 1870, it was begin all-important to anatomy them
into an congenital company. The oil is awful valued. It is actual bright and has acceptable lubricating
qualities.
  The spring-hammer drew back, a little trap or mouth at the end of the slotted tin
barrel opened for the tack, the tack jumped out, turned over, landed point downward upon the
right spot in the carpet, the crouching hammer sprang, and--

And then I lifted up the Perfect Automatic to see if the tack went in,--a simple act that any
child could do, but which took automatically and perfectly all the stretch out of the carpet;
for the hammer did not hit the tack; the tack really did not get through the trap; the trap
did not open the slot; the slot--but no matter.  We have no carpets now.  The Perfect Automatic
stands in the garret with all its original varnish on.  At its feet sits a half-used can of
"Beesene, The Prince of Floor Pastes."

We have only hard-wood floors now, which we treated, upon the strength of the label, with this
Prince of Pastes, "Beesene"--"guaranteed not to show wear or dirt or to grow gritty; water-proof,
gravel-proof.  No rug will ruck on it, no slipper stick to it.  Needs no weighted brush. Self-shining.
The only perfect Floor Wax known.  One box will do all the floors you have."

Indeed, half a box did all the floors we have.  No slipper would stick to the paste, but the
paste would stick to the slipper; and the greasy Prince did in spots all the floors we have:
the laundry floor, the attic floor, and the very boards of the vegetable cellar.

I am young yet.  I have not had time to collect my twelve two-horse loads.  But I am getting
them fast.

Only the other day a tall lean man came to the side door, asking after my four boys by name,
and inquiring when my new book would be off the stocks, and, incidentally, showing me a patent-applied-for
device called "The Fat Man's Friend."

"The Friend" was a steel-wire hoop, shaped and jointed like a pair of calipers, but knobbed
at its points with little metal balls.  The instrument was made to open and spring closed about
the Fat Man's neck, and to hold, by means of a clasp on each side, a napkin, or bib, spread
securely over the Fat Man's bosom.

"Ideal thing, now, is n't it?" said the agent, demonstrating with his handkerchief.

"Why--yes"--I hesitated--"for a fat man, perhaps."

"Just so," he replied, running me over rapidly with a professional eye; "but you know, Professor,
that when a man's forty, or thereabouts, it's the nature of him to stouten.  Once past forty
he's liable to pick up any day.  And when he starts, you know as well as I, Professor, when
he starts there's nothing fattens faster than a man of forty.  You ought to have one of these
'Friends' on hand."

"But fat does n't run in my family," I protested, my helpless, single-handed condition being
plainly manifest in my tone.

"No matter," he rejoined, "look at me!  Six feet three, and thin as a lath.  I 'm what you
might call a walking skeleton, ready to disjoint, as the poet says, and eat all my meals in
fear, which I would do if 't wa'n't for this little 'Friend.'  I can't eat without it.  I miss
it more when I am eatin' than I miss the victuals.  I carry one with me all the time.  Awful
handy little thing.  Now--"

"But--" I put in.

"Certainly," he continued, with the smoothest-running motor I ever heard, "but here's the point
of the whole matter, as you might say. This thing is up to date, Professor.  Now, the old-fashioned
way of tying a knot in the corner of your napkin and anchoring it under your Adam's apple--that's
gone by.  Also the stringed bib and safety-pin. Both those devices were crude--but necessary,
of course, Professor--and inconvenient, and that old-fashioned knot really dangerous; for the
knot, pressing against the Adam's apple, or the apple, as you might say, trying to swallow
the knot--well, if there isn't less apoplexy and strangulation when this little Friend finds
universal application, then I 'm no Prophet, as the Good Book says."

"But you see--" I broke in.

"I do, Professor.  It's right here.  I understand your objection.  But it is purely verbal
and academic, Professor.  You are troubled concerning the name of this indispensable article.
But you know, as well as I--even better with your education, Professor--that there 's nothing,
absolutely nothing in a name.  'What's in a name?' the poet says.  And I 'll agree with you--though,
of course, it's confidential--that 'The Fat Man's Friend' is, as you literary folks would say,
more or less of a nom de plume.  Isn't it?  Besides,--if you 'll allow me the language, Professor,--it's
too delimiting, restricting, prejudicing.  Sets a lean man against it.  But between us, Professor,
they 're going to change the name of the next batch. They're--"

"Indeed!" I exclaimed; "what's the next batch going to be?"

"Oh, just the same--fifteen cents each--two for a quarter.  You could n't tell them apart.
You might just as well have one of these, and run no chances getting one of the next lot. 
They'll be precisely the same; only, you see, they're going to name the next ones 'Every Bosom's
Friend,' to fit lean and fat, and without distinction of sex.  Ideal thing now, is n't it?
Yes, that's right--fifteen cents--two for twenty-five, Professor?--don't you want another for
your wife?"

No, I did not want another for her.  But if she had been at home, and I had been away, who
knows but that all six of us had come off with a "Friend" apiece?  They were a bargain by the
half-dozen.

A bargain?  Did anybody ever get a bargain--something worth more than he paid?  Well--you shall,
when you bring home a Dustless-Duster.

And who has not brought it home!  Or who is not about to bring it home! Not all the years that
I have searched, not all the loads that I have collected, count against the conviction that
at last I have it--the perfect thing--until I reach home.  But with several of my perfections
I have never yet reached home, or I am waiting an opportune season to give them to my wife.
I have been disappointed; but let no one try to tell me that there is no such thing as Perfection.
Is not the desire for it the breath of my being?  Is not the search for it the end of my existence?
Is not the belief that at last I possess it--in myself, my children, my breed of hens, my religious
creed, my political party--is not this conviction, I say, all there is of existence?

It is very easy to see that perfection is not in any of the other political parties.  During
a political campaign, not long since, I wrote to a friend in New Jersey,--

"Now, whatever your particular, personal brand of political faith, it is clearly your moral
duty to vote this time the Democratic ticket."

Whereupon (and he is a thoughtful, God-fearing man, too) he wrote back,--

"As I belong to the only party of real reform, I shall stick to it this year, as I always have,
and vote the straight ticket."

Is there a serener faith than this human faith in perfection?  A surer, more unshakable belief
than this human belief in the present possession of it?

There is only one thing deeper in the heart of man than his desire for completeness, and that
is his conviction of being about to attain unto it.  He dreams of completeness by night; works
for completeness by day; buys it of every agent who comes along; votes for it at every election;
accepts it with every sermon; and finds it--momentarily--every time he finds himself.  The
desire for it is the sweet spring of all his satisfactions; the possession of it the bitter
fountain of many of his woes.

Apply the conviction anywhere, to anything--creeds, wives, hens--and see how it works out.

As to hens:--

There are many breeds of fairly good hens, and I have tried as many breeds as I have had years
of keeping hens, but not until the poultry show, last winter, did I come upon the perfect hen.
I had been working toward her through the Bantams, Brahmas, and Leghorns, to the Plymouth Rocks.
I had tried the White and the Barred Plymouth Rocks, but they were not the hen.  Last winter
I came upon the originator of the Buff Plymouth Rocks--and here she was!  I shall breed nothing
henceforth but Buff Plymouth Rocks.

In the Buff Rock we have a bird of ideal size, neither too large nor too small, weighing about
three pounds more than the undersized Leghorn, and about three pounds less than the oversized
Brahma; we have a bird of ideal color, too--a single, soft, even tone, and no such barnyard
daub as the Rhode Island Red; not crow-colored, either, like the Minorca; nor liable to all
the dirt of the White Plymouth Rocks. Being a beautiful and uniform buff, this perfect Plymouth
Rock is easily bred true to color, as the vari-colored fowls are not.

Moreover, the Buff Rock is a layer, is the layer, maturing as she does about four weeks later
than the Rhode Island Reds, and so escaping that fatal early fall laying with its attendant
moult and eggless interim until March!  On the other hand, the Buff Rock matures about a month
earlier than the logy, slow-growing breeds, and so gets a good start before the cold and eggless
weather comes.

And such an egg!  There are white eggs and brown eggs, large and small eggs, but only one ideal
egg--the Buff Rock's.  It is of a soft lovely brown, yet whitish enough for a New York market,
but brown enough, however, to meet the exquisite taste of the Boston trade.  In fact it is
neither white nor brown, but rather a delicate blend of the two--a new tone, indeed, a bloom
rather, that I must call fresh-laid lavender.

So, at least, I am told.  My pullets are not yet laying, having had a very late start last
spring.  But the real question, speaking professionally, with any breed of fowls is a market
question: How do they dress?  How do they eat?

If the Buff Plymouth Rock is an ideal bird in her feathers, she is even more so plucked.  All
white-feathered fowl, in spite of yellow legs, look cadaverous when picked.  All dark-feathered
fowl, with their tendency to green legs and black pin-feathers, look spotted, long dead, and
unsavory.  But the Buff Rock, a melody in color, shows that consonance, that consentaneousness,
of flesh to feather that makes the plucked fowl to the feathered fowl what high noon is to
the faint and far-off dawn--a glow of golden legs and golden neck, mellow, melting as butter,
and all the more so with every unpicked pinfeather.

Can there be any doubt of the existence of hen-perfection?  Any question of my having attained
unto it--with the maturing of this new breed of hens?

For all spiritual purposes, that is, for all satisfactions, the ideal hen is the pullet--the
Buff Plymouth Rock pullet.

Just so the ideal wife.  If we could only keep them pullets!

The trouble we husbands have with our wives begins with our marrying them.  There is seldom
any trouble with them before.  Our belief in feminine perfection is as profound and as eternal
as youth.  And the perfection is just as real as the faith.  Youth is always bringing the bride
home--to hang her on the kitchen clothes-dryer.  She turns out to be ordinary cheese-cloth,
dyed a more or less fast black--this perfection that he had stamped in letters of indelible red!

The race learns nothing.  I learn, but not my children after me.  They learn only after themselves.
Already I hear my boys saying that their wives--!  And the oldest of these boys has just turned
fourteen!

Fourteen! the trouble all began at fourteen.  No, the trouble began with Adam, though Eve has
been responsible for much of it since.  Adam had all that a man should have wanted in his perfect
Garden. Nevertheless he wanted Eve.  Eve in turn had Adam, a perfect man! but she wanted something
more--if only the apple tree in the middle of the Garden.  And we all of us were there in that
Garden--with Adam thinking he was getting perfection in Eve; with Eve incapable of appreciating
perfection in Adam.  The trouble is human.

  "Flounder, flounder in the sea,
  Prythee quickly come to me!
  For my wife, Dame Isabel,
  Wants strange things I scarce dare tell."

"And what does she want now?" asks the flounder.

"Oh, she wants to vote now," says the fisherman.

"Go home, and you shall find her with the ballot," sighs the flounder. "But has n't she Dustless-Dusters
enough already?"

It would seem so.  But once having got Adam, who can blame her for wanting an apple tree besides,
or the ballot?

'T is no use to forbid her.  Yes, she has you, but--but Eve had Adam, too, another perfect
man!  Don't forbid her, for she will have it anyhow.  It may not turn out to be all that she
thinks it is.  But did you turn out to be all that she thought you were?  She will have a bite
of this new apple if she has to disobey, and die for it, because such disobedience and death
are in answer to a higher command, and to a larger life from within.  Eve's discovery that
Adam was cheese-cloth, and her reaching out for something better, did not, as Satan promised,
make us as God; but it did make us different from all the other animals in the Garden, placing
us even above the angels,--so far above, as to bring us, apparently, by a new and divine descent,
into Eden.

The hope of the race is in Eve,--in her making the best she can of Adam; in her clear understanding
of his lame logic,--that her imperfections added to his perfections make the perfect Perfection;
and in her reaching out beyond Adam for something more--for the ballot now.

If there is growth, if there is hope, if there is continuance, if there is immortality for
the race and for the soul, it is to be found in this sure faith in the Ultimate, the Perfect,
in this certain disappointment every time we think we have it; and in this abiding conviction
that we are about to bring it home.  But let a man settle down on perfection as a present possession,
and that man is as good as dead already--even religiously dead, if he has possession of a perfect
Salvation.

Now, "Sister Smith" claimed to possess Perfection--a perfect infallible book of revelations
in her King James Version of the Scriptures, and she claimed to have lived by it, too, for
eighty years.  I was fresh from the theological school, and this was my first "charge."  This
was my first meal, too, in this new charge, at the home of one of the official brethren, with
whom Sister Smith lived.

There was an ominous silence at the table for which I could hardly account--unless it had to
do with the one empty chair.  Then Sister Smith appeared and took the chair.  The silence deepened.
Then Sister Smith began to speak and everybody stopped eating.  Brother Jones laid down his
knife, Sister Jones dropped her hands into her lap until the thing should be over.  Leaning
far forward toward me across the table, her steady gray eyes boring through me, her long bony
finger pointing beyond me into eternity, Sister Smith began with spaced and measured words:--

"My young Brother--what--do--you--think--of--Jonah?"

I reached for a doughnut, broke it, slowly, dipped it up and down in the cup of mustard and
tried for time.  Not a soul stirred.  Not a word or sound broke the tense silence about the
operating-table.

"What--do--you--think--of--Jonah?"

"Well, Sister Smith, I--"

"Never mind.  Don't commit yourself.  You needn't tell me what you think of Jonah. You--are--too--young--to--know--what--you--think--of--Jonah.
But I will tell you what I think of Jonah: if the Scriptures had said that Jonah swallowed
the whale, it would be just as easy to believe as it is that the whale swallowed Jonah."

"So it would, Sister Smith," I answered weakly, "just as easy."

"And now, my young Brother, you preach the Scriptures--the old genuine inspired Authorized
Version, word for word, just as God spoke it!"

Sister Smith has gone to Heaven, but in spite of her theology.  Dear old soul, she sent me
many a loaf of her salt-rising bread after that, for she had as warm a heart as ever beat its
brave way past eighty.

But she had neither a perfect Book, nor a perfect Creed, nor a perfect Salvation.  She did
not need them; nor could she have used them; for they would have posited a divine command to
be perfect--a too difficult accomplishment for any of us, even for Sister Smith.

There is no such divine command laid upon us; but only such a divinely human need springing
up within us, and reaching out for everything, in its deep desire, from dust-cloths dyed black
to creeds of every color.

This is a life of imperfections, a world made of cheese-cloth, merely dyed black, and stamped
in red letters--The Dustless-Duster.  Yet a cheese-cloth world so dyed and stamped is better
than a cloth-of-gold world, for the cloth-of-gold you would not want to dye nor to stamp with
burning letters.

We have never found it,--this perfect thing,--and perhaps we never shall.  But the desire,
the search, the faith, must not fail us, as at times they seem to do.  At times the very tides
of the ocean seem to fail,--when the currents cease to run.  Yet when they are at slack here,
they are at flood on the other side of the world, turning already to pour back--

      ". . . lo, out of his plenty the sea
  Pours fast; full soon the time of the flood-tide shall be--"

The faith cannot fail us--for long.  Full soon the ebb-tide turns,

  "And Belief overmasters doubt, and I know that I know"

that there is perfection; that the desire for it is the breath of life; that the search for
it is the hope of immortality.

But I know only in part.  I see through a glass darkly, and I may be no nearer it now than
when I started, yet the search has carried me far from that start.  And if I never arrive,
then, at least, I shall keep going on, which, in itself maybe the thing--the Perfect Thing
that I am seeking.

VI

SPRING PLOUGHING

  "See-Saw, Margery Daw!
  Sold her bed and lay upon straw"

--the very worst thing, I used to think, that ever happened in Mother Goose.  I might steal
a pig, perhaps, like Tom the Piper's Son, but never would I do such a thing as Margery did;
the dreadful picture of her nose and of that bottle in her hand made me sure of that.  And
yet--snore on, Margery!--I sold my plough and bought an automobile! As if an automobile would
carry me

  "To the island-valley of Avilion,"

where I should no longer need the touch of the soil and the slow simple task to heal me of
my grievous wound!

Speed, distance, change--are these the cure for that old hurt we call living, the long dull
ache of winter, the throbbing bitter-sweet pain of spring?  We seek for something different,
something not different but faster and still faster, to fill our eyes with flying, our ears
with rushing, our skins with scurrying, our diaphragms, which are our souls, with the thrill
of curves, and straight stretches, of lifts, and drops, and sudden halts--as of elevators,
merry-go-rounds, chutes, scenic railways, aeroplanes, and heavy low-hung cars.

To go--up or down, or straight away--anyway, but round and round, and slowly--as if one could
speed away from being, or ever travel beyond one's self!  How pathetic to sell all that one
has and buy an automobile! to shift one's grip from the handles of life to the wheel of change!
to forsake the furrow for the highway, the rooted soil for the flying dust, the here for the
there; imagining that somehow a car is more than a plough, that going is the last word in living--demountable
rims and non-skid tires, the great gift of the God Mechanic, being the 1916 model of the wings
of the soul!

But women must weep in spite of modern mechanics, and men must plough. Petroleum, with all
of its by-products, cannot be served for bread.  I have tried many substitutes for ploughing;
and as for the automobile, I have driven that thousands of miles, driven it almost daily, summer
and winter; but let the blackbirds return, let the chickweed start in the garden, then the
very stones of the walls cry out--"Plough! plough!"

It is not the stones I hear, but the entombed voices of earlier primitive selves far back in
my dim past; those, and the call of the boy I was yesterday, whose landside toes still turn
in, perhaps, from walking in the furrow.  When that call comes, no

  "Towered cities please us then
  And the busy hum of men,"

or of automobiles.  I must plough.  It is the April wind that wakes the call--

  "Zephirus eek, with his sweetë breeth"--

and many hearing it long to "goon on pilgrimages," or to the Maine woods to fish, or, waiting
until the 19th, to leave Boston by boat and go up and down the shore to see how fared their
summer cottages during the winter storms; some even imagine they have malaria and long for
bitters--as many men as many minds when

  "The time of the singing of birds is come
  And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land."

But as for me it is neither bitters, nor cottages, nor trout, nor

  "ferne halwes couth in sondry landës"

that I long for: but simply for the soil, for the warming, stirring earth, for my mother. 
It is back to her breast I would go, back to the wide sweet fields, to the slow-moving team
and the lines about my shoulder, to the even furrow rolling from the mould-board, to the taste
of the soil, the sight of the sky, the sound of the robins and bluebirds and blackbirds, and
the ringing notes of Highhole over the sunny fields.

I hold the plough as my only hold upon the earth, and as I follow through the fresh and fragrant
furrow I am planted with every footstep, growing, budding, blooming into a spirit of the spring.
I can catch the blackbirds ploughing, I can turn under with my furrow the laughter of the flowers,
the very joy of the skies.  But if I so much as turn in my tracks, the blackbirds scatter;
if I shout, Highhole is silent; if I chase the breeze, it runs away; I might climb into the
humming maples, might fill my hands with arbutus and bloodroot, might run and laugh aloud with
the light; as if with feet I could overtake it, could catch it in my hands, and in my heart
could hold it all--this living earth, shining sky, flowers, buds, voices, colors, odors--this
spring! 

There are a handful of interesting topics that are discussed, ranging
from his remarks regarding the difficulty of fulfilling literary requirements
of the day to a detailed discussion about his religious opinion.

Readers will surely enjoy learning about the peculiar demands of editors, the absurd pretensions of actors,
and crazy reading habits. Subsequently, an edifice was built especially
for the housing of the operators during the explosion. This building, lying about 36 feet from
the boiler, was made up of a compartment shielded on the side adjacent the portico by a substantial
earthen berm, into which was made a rectilinear opening (consisting of a lining of planks)
at head level, providing a way for the operators to monitor the course of the testing with no
endangerment to themselves. It should be noted, however, that up to this time, the boiler had
successfully contained the force of the explosions, and no one had been hurt in any of the tests.
Also, a gasometer was installed in the sheltering building to enable
the operators to control the amount of gas passing to the testing
device, and the electrical apparatus which detonated the cartridges
being tested.

Because there was no uninterrupted flow of firedamp convenient to the operation, they instead used
lamp gas in the mixing of the explosives for the tests. The hollow made for the receipt of the
explosive mixture is filled with it and made ready for detonation, and the temperature of the
blend is controlled by way of a steam pipe. The door to the operators' building and the two safety
slots in the ceiling having been sealed with paper disks held in place by mucilage, the gas conduit
is opened until the target percentage is reached; the blend of air
and gas only requires a brief time to diffuse into the container,
the dissimilarity in density motivating the ascent of the gas once
escaped from the jet, which lies on the floor of the enclosure.

The detonating charge is then touched off electrically and the shot is fired. An operator, safely
sheltered in the observation building, can view, through small flanking windows, any flames which
might be produced, and thereby, gain the modicum of experience necessary to enable him to tell
by just listening, whether or not an explosion has activated the
mixture.

  You may play upon it, travel
over it, delve into it, build your house down on it; but when you strike into the bosom of
the fields with your ploughshare, wounding and healing as your feet follow deep in the long
fresh cut, you feel the throbbing of the heart of life through the oaken handles as you never
felt it before; you are conscious of a closer union,--dust with dust,--of a more mystical union,--spirit
with spirit,--than any other approach, work, or rite, or ceremony, can give you. The biographies
I read do not discuss the issue. Is it a portrait? Is it of Franz von Sickingen like Kugler suggests?
It appears the print is dated 1513. I cannot find any date on my print.
 

It's not for me to tell of the sweetness of their courtship. Even if I tried I wouldn't be able
to. We loved them both so very much. One day in early summer our son Cyrus came to me and asked
if I would let him go away for a while. He considerably stirred things up-- especially the enemy. His trade
was sniping; for two hours every single morning, every ten minutes a Corporal brought him
drinks in order to keep him cool, and a Sergeant spotting for him.

He had made notches on his dug-out post to mark the number of Huns he had killed. He would etch in
a notch every time he rang the bell,and before the first month he had been with us had passed
that post could have easily passed as a four foot saw.

"Of course the Huns were annoyed. Let me just say, we were outstanding and they were outstanding,
and between us there was less than one hundred yards. We could clearly hear them when they
ate, when there was food to be had, and when there wasn't they smoked horrible smelling cigars,
which contained a more horrific odor than all the gas they had ever expelled. On a certain day
the Sub. arrives for his morning practice and notices a large sign
over the enemy trench: 'We are Saxons.

Don't shoot.' They had alleviated they Prussians and were bustling about their trenches as
free as a Band of Hope outing.

"Unless it is proved to be the contrary,' our Sub. states., I retain the belief that Saxons are
Germans.' And, he adds,'war is war,' and three notches had to be
added to his post in order to make them undertand that he was malevolent.

  When they did begin to understand they began to attack us, and they
continued to attack harshly for the remainder of the day.

Our Sub. had had enough by the time night fell.

He said, 'Boys, on hour before sunrise them Germans are gonna be
run out of that trench,'he said, We shall not make a frontal attack,
due to the fact that some of us could rip our clothing on the enemy's
traps and housewives are a rarity.

   

On both sides of the room and elegant carved ebony chairs, marble or onyx panels. Pictures decorated
the walls of the rich Chinese.

Towards the back of the room hung a banner, '283 licensed food in
the House of Representatives'.

There was a large table in the middle of the room. Forward, on either side, in the cavities, an
integral part of the rest of the room, sofas and opium, with the tubes and lamps ready for use.
We give this description in full, as it applies, almost without change,
and all the others that we visited in the immediate vicinity.

Food was provided on the system, and alcoholic drinks, and opium. In the second place, in the opposite
corner of the block itself, the man told us that was used in place of the same purposes. We
asked the women, and they replied that it was too late to see them, but if we are to come in earlier
we find them.

He was asked where it came from women, leading to the street below, to open a brothel, said
that a large number of women living near degraded from; said the
brothel-keepers sent them.

She said the white man, as well as the Chinese came to the place. After that we walked along
the streets and many of the side streets in the vicinity of the near, and show the truth of what
the men had told us on the numbers of swarming degraded for girls
and women.

"The next night we went to the same neighborhood, and to review in two places already mentioned,
and. Others also, as we got to the top of stairs and passed in the front room of the place invited
us to return, there was quite a flutter of excitement, and we saw immediately that There are
a number of girls present, all very young, and children just a few.

On the left we have a fat man, and Chinese middle-aged Sabbath, with two or three young girls,
one in his lap and one on either side of him, his arms, the two most similar throw the dice on the
table inside the front hatch, and the rest were sitting on the sofas
of opium.

  If there is a more delightful chapter in American literature
than that one in Walden on the bean-patch, I don't know which chapter it is. The wise among us
know of the strategies employed by Pope soon after, in an attempt to attain a broader and more
illustrious reputation than any other English Poet had in life.

Those who know this also know that the poor application of those
efforts is the reason that Pope has long since dropped to such a low
level of influence in the literary canon, such that he would never
have suffered had he not been overly interested in popularity and
instant gratification.

Had Pope placed more confidence in his natural ability, he would never have lost so much respect.

[12] Hughes clearly writes of this in his dedication of Works to Lord Somers by Spenser as
follows.
Pope mesmerized the country with his musical cadence, and enthralled
it by his careful polish, and in so doing blinded himself with illusions
of grandeur.

 They
were the mothers of young girls as old-fashioned at all levels, ostensibly because they did
not devote himself to the poor and ignorant alone - the so-called poor: the poor in spirit,
regardless their rank, were many of their care as well as the poor
scholarship, their charge was sisters all who needed help - a help
they have given quite simply, with love, not as mediators, but as
related to a large family by breaking the ties that bound them to
their own particular household.

There was no visible effect scenic walk along the humblest of their benevolence pure, hard edge
to mark the courses they have, or to show the world devoted to excellence in particular throughout
a life painful mortifications. Very silent was their own quiet way. In a spirit of gratitude
that they have accepted their fate by turning his very bitter joy in receiving with gratitude
the many pleasures yet deigned to them, for he is a happy, despite all its trials, for those
just looking for happiness. Our sister found him and gave. How bless his name! How many have
been why the love the memories of these two women discreet, who,
unnamed, or station, or show, or individual, or distinction of any
kind, have been kind of a class whose the circle of the same memory
humble, by its truth and suggestiveness, can help the extension -
of the true, simple, sincere, courageous, Sisters of Charity saint
of our country!

Against corruption.

I am not sure of corruption. It may be a bad thing, but many seem
to think otherwise.

Much can be said on both sides of the issue. Oh do not tell me of a worm sell his birthright for
a mess of pottage: I have never read such verses of Buffon, or even in Pliny. But if they exist
in the human form, the meanness is in the sale, and not in the quid pro quo. A flat lens itself
is a very good thing - I should say something very respectable, and no exchange can take away
from this character. However, if we give it as an inheritance from our ancestors and our posterity
membership, the transaction is lousy, and not only pathetic, but
dishonest.

If this is proven, I do not defend the worm. Trampling on him by all means - jump on him. But
beware of insulting the mess of pottage, which is as respectable as when new out of the pot.
Fancy the sale having been effected by some other equivalent, and that, moreover, is exactly
what puzzles me.

There are many other equivalents, not a whit more respectable in themselves - much smaller - which
not only avoid any entreaty, but serve to raise the identical operation of the class of meanness.
The confusion of a mind like mine, even at length to doubt the existence of prejudice in the
thing at all. Turning to the more patiently. I admit I'm slow, but "slow and sure, you know.

Corruption is a universal element in a civilized society, but let
us speak in time of political corruption and corruption.

 In the meantime, Pope knew the whole story was a fable. The Duke
had been injured in a fox-chase. Therefore in such as an extreme situation, the servants carried
him to the nearest house, which was an alehouse. This was not was the worst place because there
was no other place near the accident.

Also, because of his position, lord-lieutenant of East Riding, he would be given the best room. During
these dreadful circumstances, a person cannot measure the defects, however, that were visibile
on the walls, the curtains and on the flock-beds.

But, Pope was at his wits end. He did not want to believe the legendary lies that had been
told to him about a great lord who was once extremely rich but now did not have the money to
purchase a pauper's bed. Pope was born a few months prior to the Duke's death and the remaining
Villers family member who wore the crown was too great and memorable
for him to have died in obscurity.

He was known as one of the most interesting people of the Alcibiades class. His habitual lies and
story telling could only be accepted by the the after-generation who were not acquainted with
the truth. These stories were wild fabricated fictional stories instead of popular rumors.
At the time of his death, the Duke of Buckingham had wealth that was without precedent in Europe.
This wealth consisted of sixty thousand per year, which was mostly in land. This may have been considered
an exaggeration but the Fair Fax Papers made it clear that this story
was untrue

.
 

The symbolism in this chapter makes the prophecy easier to understand. The wild beasts correspond with
the Western kingdoms of the world. The description of the two-horned beast represents the Eastern
Empire and the image of the wild beast identifies the Roman Hierarchy. These three empires will rule
until the end of the world.

However, the latter kingdom will be destroyed by the brightness of
Christâs return (2 Thess.

2:8), and the two former kingdoms be cast alive into the lake of fire, 19:20. This vision would
have been lacking if it did not include those who will be persecuted for not worshipping the
beasts or its image.

These Christians will also reject the mark of the beast and as a result will be warred against
and overcome by him but they will remain faithful to Christ. There will be a group of redeemed
Christians on Mount Zion.

They are the first fruit to God and the Lamb. They will be presented as faultless because
they do no lie.

Rev. 14:1-5. Christ, a metaphorical name, is the Lamb of God.

Mount Zion symbolizes the new earth, which is the place where the
Lord will reign and the saints shall be regenerated.

Mount Zion and Jerusalem are both used to represent the city, which
the Lord has chosen above all the places on earth to place his name.

It is appropriate to name the heavenly city, the new Jerusalem, which
is all the names which were applied to the old.

 Before America, India spoke a different tongue. It is another country
that speaks two languages.

The Religion of Business
Hanging on the wall in the house where I am living,there is a vintage poster. It is a coloured picture,
showing one young, attractive couple and one elderly couple. The elderly woman is holding
an hour glass and and her partner is leaning on a walking stick. Below it reads:
"My father and mother that go so stuping to your grave, Pray tell
me what good I may in this world expect to have?"

"My son, the good you can expect is all forlorn, Men doe not gather
grapes from of a thorn." 
Sometimes I think that the new and old
worlds attitude to each other is symbolised by this inscription. 

(Is he a Marinettist, I speculate?)  There is not an adequate sum of vocabulary in the language
for him, so he creates brand new ones with determination; while as
for sentence structure and syntax he overpoweringly throttled them
in Chapter I.; nor did they improve.

I will possess that in spite of all this the writer has a way of
making you read on to discover what it is entirely about.

You don't find out; but there, life's like that, isn't it?
The writerâs thoughts of the operations of elevated finance are
trusting.

The Mandrill (do I precisely speculate this to be a picture distorted from the life?), who
is absent to turn copper and "do down" the Squid (cranium of the contrasting copper crowd), is,
if you are to critic by his obsessive enthusiasm at board meetings,
about as likely to corner the emerald cheese in the moon.

 Whether in palace or
cottage, domestic life has been improved by their presence. The young have tried to copy their
patience, generosity, and heroism. Their images of sin have led many to restrain their evil
ways and have led to good resolutions being made.
These kinds of writers have reflected the era's best inclinations.
And they could do this since they are among the highest quality people
of their age. These

It can be assumed that these various diagram were the work of the
small small sized race when observed with keen interest.

May be the present day man may not understand some of the passages.
 

"My sweet Nydia, come here, now," she quietly requested to the Thessalian.

"Don't you remember how I told you that you are like a sister to me; like a friend? I feel as
though yuo are not only those things, but more - my good luck charm and savior!"

"Its my pleasure and my duty," she coldly replied as she lay there, unmoving.
 

The man himself can repent wholeheartedly as per his own decision. He can renew himself with a new
heart and a new spirit.

This is his gateway to change a new. Suppose if a man gets some kind of wrong belief through a
misunderstanding of bible fats, then he will never have a chance to lead his life with better
understanding of those same facts.
Perhaps, if he feels something wrong impression that science and the Bible are in conflict, then
certainly there is no way to get him out of such wrong impression.

So it is important that every ministry has to be well packed with well qualified scientist.
Many unbelievers who are not thoroughly investigated, are over stating that the Bible is entirely
against and different from science. They are actually considered
as unknown persons about the bible and science.

Most of people are categorized in this class only. They are men like apes, they will be leaders,
and they will be living their own influence only.

Many of them will try exhibit themselves as they are well known of each and everything as
Strauss and they will not like to exhibit themselves as they are actually even if they are
unknown about everything.

If they want to have such a mind, they will do their thinking as
the highest of their ambition.

There are more chances possible to deal with heart diseases. They will be as interested in
the glory of names of such men as Strauss. They will be far from real truths about anything
and especially from the facts of the Bible. He was so far away and so they are far from learning
the real fact that he was divorced from his wife, the former actress,
Agnese Schebest.

He was spending his days by going here and there and from one place
to another place aimlessly.

His special work called pseudo-theology or mythology had ended with
a serious theatrical comedy and finally it has become ended with a
serious tragedy.

"In 1839 this famous personality called Dr. Strauss-- had been resolved the gospel history of
salvation into a disjointed and self-contradictory mythological poem. Besides he had been neglected
the existence of a personal God and the immortality of the soul. Then he was duly elected as a professor
of Christian dogma tics and ethics in the University of Zurich. This selection had been occurred
by the party first and then in power, which was entirely consisted with demagogues and frivolous
infidels."

We do not have faith in ourselves, or our assignment, or our divine decrees. Our existence has
no hypothesis, and we care only for outward shapes and emblems. Our taste is disgusted by the
crudeness of vice, but we have no quarrel with the question itself; and if the people around us
will only preserve a shining, or at least harmless shell, that is all we request. Why should we
inspect below the faÃ§ade in their case, when we do no such thing in our own? We feel affable, elegant, and cultured;
we hate the appearance of low impropriety, and would take a lot of trouble to put it appart;
we look very amiable on the world in general, if the low people who are living in it would
only become as comely as ourselves. In the old republics, the situation was other. There men
had a hypothesis, even if a wrong one, and they stuck to it through
good report and through bad report.

The hypothesis was the soul of the people, and its members inmolated to it their whole personality.
No wonder that such little political integrity held together as if
their forming parts had been bonded, and that they continued to do
so till they came into crash, and, from their rigidness and rudeness,
wiped one another out.

Put down thievery and bribing: that is honest.

And more especially put down open, flagrant, and violent thievery and bribing, for its very
hardness is, in itself, an extra felony. But no amend is efective that does not come from within;
and when refined men carry on war against common depravity, let them
look acutely to their own.

I do not speak, that by taking thought they will be able to do completely away with the alluring
influence of a defer, or a dinner, or a caring action; and that, in spite of these, they will
do their obligation with the stern resolve of an old Spartan. But they will be less likely to
yield to seduction, and the price of their valor will at least mount higher and higher, which
is as much as we can expect of human nature. The grand advantage, however, they will derive
from the inmolatioon, is the lesson of tolerance it will train.

They will refrain, for shame's sake, from casting rocks and calling nicknames. They will see
that the only part of the insult, they can notice is bad taste and oblivion, and they will
quietly try to upgrade the one and advise the other.
THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM, LIVERPOOL.
In a cross street called Colquitt Street, near a fashionable prom
of Liverpool, will be found the opulent, expensive, and interesting
museum which we are about briefly to review.

It is the property of Mr Joseph Mayer, F.S.A., a townsman of Liverpool, esteemed as much for his
private wealth as for his exquisite classical elegance. This gentleman has been long known as
a collector; and by the purchase of a complete gallery of antiquities,
formed by one who travelled long in Egypt and Nubia, and visited the
remains of old Carthage, he became possessed of a museum so large
that his private household could not contain them, and so exceptional,
that the people desired to know more about them.

With the view, therefore, of keeping them together, and gratifying
the many who longed to acquaint themselves with these interesting
artifacts of an interesting civilization, this household in Colquitt
Street has been appropriated.

For the purpose of meeting the current expenses of the exposition,
and enabling the owner to add to its contents, a very trifling charge
is made for admission, and a diary is kept for the comments of the
visitors.

The first room entered shows a big collection of Egyptian stelÃ¦ and other statues, while the
outer cases and sarcophagi of many mummies are placed in another apartment. The word stela means
merely a gravestone or tombstone; and in this room the reflective mind will find much resources
for concentration.
 But there constituted one difference 'tween the outrages of 1740 and
1914.

The great barrator made no insincere feigning of wanting peace of mind. It was reserved for
Harnack and Hauptmann, not to speak of the Kaiser, to cant about the duties of "Kul-tur" (that prostitute
of the German language lexicon, adulterated by completely dishonourable uses), about the hastening
of the kingdom of heaven, and about the Teutonic blade being sanctified by God. But the old German
Adam stayed on, and when, 2 days ahead the announcement of warfare with France, the German
soldiers were taking flight to the Belgian frontier there was no thought of the Archduke Ferdinand
or of the doddery old man on the Austrian throne, whose agnate heart had been painfully bruised.
Germany was out to fleece France of her colonies--to fleece her, and the Germans recognized
it.
"A few centuries might have to run their course," said their own poet
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (who certainly acknowledged the German
psyche), "earlier it can be said of the German masses, 'it's a long
time since they were savages.'"

Such, then, were a few of the issues in the avid drama of the war which occurred in Germany prior
to the rising of the drape.

Not a theologist, a philosopher, an historian, or a poet to reminiscence
the past of his nation, to admonish it not to duplicate the crime
of a century and a half before, which had besmirched its name eternally
before the judicatures of human beings and God; not a national leader
to prompt a generation that was too young to recall 1870 of the wretchednesses
and repulsions of war, for (unfortunately for the benefit of the Earth!)
the one avid German voice that could have done so with exploring and
blackening eloquence (the voice of Bebel) had only just been quietened
by the grave.

  And so it came to pass that Germany,
    in the cracks of doom
  of July 1914, bestowed the miserable
    spectacle of an eminent country being enticed on to its ethical death-agony
amid canting solicitations to the God Almighty, and barbaric outbursts
of popular joyfulness.

A CONVERSATION WITH LORD ROBERTS
In the meantime what had been going on among ourselves? The far-off murmuring of the forthcoming
breaking wind had been heard by all of us, but as none can desire to distinguish the consequence
on the whole Empire, possibly each may be permitted to indicate the character of the admonition
as it came to his own ears. It was at Naples, not long after the event, that I discovered how
the belated King had felt about his last visit to Berlin. I was then on my way home from Egypt, where
I had spent a few days at Mena, as Lord Roberts was staying there on his way back from the Soudan.
He appeared uneasy and apprehensive.

On 2 consecutive mornings I sat with him for a long 60 minutes in the shade of the terraces
which overlook the Great Pyramid* talking about the "German peril."

After the great soldier had left for Cairo he dropped a line asking
me to consider our conversations as classified; and down to this minute
I have always done so, but I ascertain no harm now (quite the reverse
of harm) in recapitulating the substance of what he said so many years
ago on a matter of such boundless momentousness.

"Do you genuinely attach importance to this scare of a German intrusion?"

I enquired.
"I am afraid I do," stated Lord Roberts.
"You believe an enemy army could be set down on our shores?"
"As affairs are at present, yes, I believe it could."
"Do you believe you could land an army on the eastern sea-coast of England and advance to London?"

"Yes, I do."

"In a dense mist, of course?" "Without a mist," said Lord Roberts. After that he described in
detail the measures we had better to take to attain such an onslaught
inconceivable and I expedite to add that, so far as I can ascertain
and acknowledge, the preventative measures he advocated have all been
adopted since the outbreak of the war.

"WE'LL fight back AND FIGHT SOON"

By that time I had, in common with the absolute majority of my countrymen who journeyed a good
deal abroad, been obliged to accredit the ever-increasing aggression
of the German and British peoples whenever they came across one another
on the highways of the world--their incessant cross-purposes on steamers,
in railway trains, hotels, casinos, post and telegraph offices--making
social intercourse hard and friendship impossible.

The domineering ways of numerous German travellers, their belligerent and tyrannising selfishness,
which always necessitated the best seating, the finest suite, and
the first attention, was year by year turning increasingly impermissible
to the British spirit.

It can't be said that we assented. Indeed, it must be acknowledged that our country-people normally
met the German arrogates to be the supermen of Europe with rather inessential self-assertion.
 

  I followed the man through the small gate in
  the fence - a barb wire fence, at that - and
  into the building. The man then said "Proceed."
  

  "Where?" I asked.
  The question angered him somewhat. "Straight ahead,"
  the man said.
  So I went straight ahead.

  The man instructed, loudly, "Left!" So I turned.
  There was a door in front of me. "Entrez," the
  man commanded. I entered. Inside the room
  was a nondescript man in a French uniform, sitting at a type of table.

  "Monsieur le medecin, le nouveau." The doctor
  rose. "Your shirt. Open it." I opened my
  shirt. Then, right before I was about to be escorted
  from the room, the man asked me if I was English.

  "No" I replied. "American." "Vraiment"--the
  man looked at me thoughtfully. "South American,
  are you?" I told him I was from the United States."
  "Vraiment"-- he said again, his tone bordering on agreeableness.

  "Pourqou vous etes ici?" "I don't know," I said
  with a pleasant smile. "Except a friend of mine wrote
  some letters that were intercepted by the French
  censor." "Ah.." the man said, "C'est tout."

  
  And, finally, I left. "Proceed!" shouted
  the Black Holster. I retraced my footsteps and was
  almost leaving when.. "Stop! Nom de Dieu!

  Proceed!"
  Bewildered as I was, I asked "Where?"
  "Up," he said, angrily.
  I turned to the stairs on the left and ascended them, but he shouted
behind me, "Not so fast there."

  
  I complied. We both reached the landing. At
  that point, I was sure that the Gestionnaire was an
  unpleasant man; I imagined a lean, wiry person rushing at me and
shouting "Hands up".

  In French, of course. The door in front of me was
  wide open and I peered into the room beyond. The
  Surveillant was standing there, hands behind
  their back, watching my progress with approval.

  I considered bowing when a noise to the left caught
  my attention. Coming from a dark and dirty
  hall were the sounds of women's voices. I
  was shocked.

Within the shadows were faces looking at me unabashedly. How many of them were there? Dozens?
Hundreds?--
"Qu'est-ce que vous faites," and so on and so forth, and the planton shoved me towards another flight
of stairs. With that type of reinforcement, I had no choice but to ascend the stairway. I thought
of the Surveillant as a spider, sitting within the center of his
web, waiting for a fly to expend a little too much effort to escape..

At the top of these stars was another hall. The door, which was shut,
made it plain there was someone above even the Surveillant. The words
on the door left to room for contemplation. They read: 
GESTIONNAIRE
I was undescribably bewildered. 

The objections are obvious utility, and from the confusion of words
is not confined to homophones, the practical difficulties that sometimes
is caused by the slight similarities can be properly invoked to illustrate
and enforce the argument.

I will give just one example.
[Side note: not limited to utility charges homophones.]
The phone, which seems to reduce the value of differentiation of consonants, has revealed unexpected
similarities.

Both pairs caused confusion, the first of which was cured by replacing the name of the letter
O for the name of the number zero, which happens to be identical to it in form, [9] and this
introduces a vocal session ou (= should), but the other pair remained a constant source of error,
that people had put their house in the phone system in general would ask the Post Office to give
a number that do not contain a 9 or 5 bis; and almost certainly did
not have the automatic dialing system, which was invented long ago
another way, got rid of the pain, one of these two figures have changed
its name in the post office.

[Note 9: It is no coincidence of an accident - the Arabic symbol for zero is the same to our letter
O, and the name of our O (= should) is the same as the present tense of be, which is common
name (in vain) of the Arabic zero, and that their voice does not
occur in the name of any encryption system.] 
[Footnote: aesthetic
objections.] 
In a uniform effect can say that utilitarian and aesthetic
considerations are generally less than one, and this statement should
be sufficient blank here, at first could not be treated briefly but
it is still that good aesthetic objections are homophones never clearly
separated from the scientific community.

I submit the following considerations.
Anyone who seriously attempts to write English well which sound will be aware of how sensitive
our ears are delicate repetition of sounds.

They have often seen the need to change some words without substantial because it reminded
stressed vowel and jarred with one that was perhaps as much as two or three lines removed from
it, neither seems to be a rule for this, because apparently similar occurrences do not always
get offended, and can even be enjoyable.
The relationship of sound to meaning is indefinable, but homophones, it is evident, for example,
the common term so could not be used in a paragraph where the word good (= spring) had occurred.
But this being so, it is very inconvenient to find the ubiquitous
say no and not knowing each other: and so does the sea and see, if
you are writing to the sea after seeing the word is banned, or at
least needs some manipulation.

I see the depth of soil untrampled scattered with green and purple algae:
algae here is risky, but I see untrampled the sea floor would have been impossible, even family

The sea saw and fled
is almost comical, especially because "the sea saw has a joint-tenant
commitment in the children's play swing 
See saw Margery daw.

The awkwardness of these homophones English is much higher because of the absence of inflection,
and I guess it was the richness of its inflections that made the Greeks so indifferent (apparently)
syllabic recurrence displeasing to us: on the other hand, the similarity
in sound between their similar syllables was much obscured by a verbal
accent and inflection respected ignore the mother, while our accent
is generally faithful to the root.

[10] This sensitivity to the sound of the syllables is of the essence of our best English, and
where the effect is more magic in our great poets is impossible to analyze.
[Note 10: Provided that this is not true - as in rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, business, company,
etc. - which have greater freedom in the use of words. Such words, as Dr. Bradley said, giving
Canada, Canada as an example, are often due to a phonetic varieties imported foreign syntax,
and pronunciation involves familiarity with literature and written
forms: but very often are purely the result of our native syllabising,
not only in the shifting of the focus (as in the first example above)
but also by changing the vowel marked according to their position
in the word, the general trend is to make the long vowels in monosyllables
and penultimate accent, but short vowels in antepenultimate accent.

 

We should get an ideal of Christ as that of St. Francis, or St. Theresa and that of the English
prayer book, even if we took the real meaning of the Gospels and accepted what is said about Christ.
It would be the Christ who men loved and adored, the built up of
a living and intimately understood personality, from the parts of
story and doctrine which connects the name.

All the prayers, all the acceptances, all the penances, charities, and sacrifices and half the art
of the Christian world are inspired by this subjective image.
The insufficient legend of Virgin Mary, who has enormously inspired the imagination of the
Catholics, gives a plain illustration of the building up of an ideal form of Christ. The incarnation
and the crucifixion are the two spontaneous sympathetic events which formed the basis of things. These
mighty scenes, illuminate the figure of the Virgin and makes us think of her freedom from
original sin, and her universal motherhood.

Thus we form in ourselves the noblest and beautiful of characters. The Protestant mind does
not give an inspection of this ideal due to its foolish iconoclasm and that is a pity.
 You
there,

What the heck does the Bishop mean in the last section of this? A few people took a look at
it for me, but the meaning of that one particular phrase he uses escapes all of us.

Signed, Mr. R. -- Greetings.

What happened to that manuscript of The Duke of Wharton's collected poetry, the one that Ritson
worked on?

It was comprehensive, almost as much so as the edition that made it to press sixty-seven years
before 1800. Please assist me in my attempt to track it down.

Sincerely yours, E.F. Rimbault. -- Where can I get Oates' signature? You know, Titus Oates,
that guy, the one who did that thing. Who out there has an autograph? Write to me with details.
Your regular correspondent, E.F.R. -- To the readers:

Hey. What's up. Since you know so much more than I do, seriously, could you help me by answering
a few questions about some stuff I want to know about:

Question
one: Where can I find an English or French translation of The Metamorphoses
of Apuleius, or you may have heard it called The Golden Ass, Asinus
aureus, because that's what St. Augustine referred to it as. Oh, and
I want excellent translations, nothing incomplete or substandard,
in English or French.

One of each would be great.

Question two: Desiderius Erasmus. The Colloquies. Where can I find them? Got to have copies of the
whole thing, all the volumes available, and, please, in English -- not the original Latin,
for God's sake. Why did he write it in Latin anyway? Not that I can read Burgundian or whatever
his native language was in the Netherlands. Anyway. Please help me find them. I need them. Must have.
Money no object. But cheaper is better, if all other conditions are met.

Desperately, Mr. I. -- Dear Sirs,

Okay, I don't understand something I'm reading because it's too hard and I really don't know what
it's about. Well I do, I do know, but I don't really know how to validate it or confirm it.
Either it's hot air or it isn't and I can't tell.

It's an early 19th century essay on science in antiquity written
by someone called Jarvis, some sort of captain in the Royal Engineers,
printed in India, in Calcutta, though he was garrisoned in Bombay.

The proof appears to rely entirely on scripture, specifically Old
Testament.

Basically, Jarvis, whomever he was, thought he understood the exact size of a cubit on the
basis of calculations reconciling these three measures: vessel, cubit,
and bath (one of which we think we know the size of, so, in theory,
we also know the size of one other one, which is its derivative, though
the connection between those two and the other one is up for debate)
using passages in Ezekiel, Chronicles, and Kings.

So ... if he knew what he was talking about, then maybe there's something here for me, but I
don't get it, so I ask you and your readers for help.

Contact me for more information, or if you've heard of this essay.

Thanks in advance, Tyrone Wordstylist -- To Whom It May Etc.:

Yo.

So I got this Latin quotation, right, and I have to know who said it, like. I know freaking
well where I found it, yeah, because it's right here under my thumb
in Anatomy of Melancholy, right, you know, the one by Robert Burton,
that one.

Page 55, yo, in my one volume edition; or, if that's how you roll,
page 80 of the eight volume edition.

It says in the notes that this quote is from Gaius Sallustius Crispus
(street name: Sallust), but I cannot find it anywhere in anything
by that gentleman, know what I mean?

Oh, yeah, I forgot to include the quote: it goes like 'sedem animÃ¦ in extremis digitis habent'.

Yeah,
so don't write to me with a translation, 'cause I got that.

What I want is the origin, man. Get it to me. Peace, out.

Signed, WS -- Dear Editors and Readers of this Periodical,

I am interested in tracking down a burial site in France, specifically the one associated with
the church, chapel, or cathedral where prayers and masses for the
dead were first uttered in the name of St. Pancrus.

As you probably have heard, there is a St. Pancrus's here near London, and those masses are said
for the Catholic dead here. In fact, it is the only church of its kind to continue this Roman practice
after the Protestant Reformation in England. Incidentally, I'm told that there are also masses
said in the Vatican in this saint's name. I'm looking for the place
in France, and also the date that this practice of masses in the name
of St. Pancrus began there. 

Writing from Surrey, Mr. S.H. -- This
space reserved for responses to letters. Simply,' I continued, playing my roll with as much talent as I possessed, and more than
I could have believed myself a few days ago, 'I donât want to get locked up.'  'No, no,' he
replied, 'I don't want you to get put away either, Jacky. I should miss you, very much. But you
act sensibly, and you will be all right. What's more, I will show you how to make your fortune
before we have done.'  'I should like to make riches,' I said, with truth.
 

The happiness of this universe or the heaven which would shower upon the people living on earth would
surely enter deep into the hearts of the people and gives them a sort of joy that they could not
wield.

The utmost happiness which would posses the one who are blessed, betrays itself by changing
into some holy discontentment, and gives something from its unending heart a pile of uncountable
desires, which are decorated by the memory in bright colors and toil due to inborn thirst to
achieve. This could be an explanation in the sense of Wordsworth, but certainly not of Chaucerâs.

âAnd lusty thoughts full of great longingsâ 
This is some thing
which is over criticized.

But however no criticism could do more justice between two great writers like Chaucer and Wordsworth. If
you weigh the power of poetry with a scale it should turn even with a small weight like that
of a grain, and even with the weight of a ray of the sun, because they do not weigh ordinary
things, but they weigh the spirit. Could anybody say that Wordsworth has not done his job perfectly
well? Instead we could mean that all the failure he faced were due to the fact of his and his colleagues
trying to do the impossible deeds. We cannot measure its every bit. All we can do is to make the
reader compare the verses themselves. Though we compare with a consideration, we feel that
modern English cannot be compared to the old English.

There is a vibration caused within us in the old version which is
not felt in the new.

To finalize, we are of the feeling for long that verse is something sacred while the song is
meant for inspiration; that all we feel, think, the words and the musical note together comes out
of the soul in one work; that translation could not be done naturally;
at the same time, that we are supposed to hail such a great poet.

Also consider John Dryden? He is out of criticism for he did not translate any of the works of
Chaucer, but he composed everything originally.

If the work of Chaucer blended with that of a translator has the danger of spoiling the whole
work. To say, Chaucer has his own charm in his words, which will capture your heart and transform
your feelings and melt you along with the flow.

This magical divine charm is missing in the modern poetry. But Dryden asserts without fear which
will take you in a mood of rejoice.

Mr.Horne says that the grand charge to which the translations are
amenable is that he has acted upon a false principle.

Let it be, because they are hailed in our poetical literature.

Mr.Horne considers them to be unfit to read. He also here acts on the false principle and he
mistakes everything. But he respects the genius works of Dryden and praises his marvelous
achievement.

He says that the Drydenâs version of the Knightâs Tale to be
read by one of the Virgilâs heroes who walk up and down in a battle
field, with a shining spear in his hands which he would throw on his
enemies.

 

A letter to the Editor of the Mirror, on saturday, the 15th September,
1827, Vol.10.no 273,  on GASPARD MONGE'S MAUSOLEUM.

  Sir, I have designed
  a gaol for the City and county of Norwich.You have embellished the

Poems are given a broader range of emotion to work with, while hymns
are bound by the fact that they are spiritual songs meant to uplift
the human spirit.

As such, hymns do not preach philosophy.
 

[Footnote: Mental belongings which are realities of course inside the mental world.]
We can at present quick look at a few particular types of knowing,
so as to notice better whether the humanistic description fits.

On the numerical and reasonable types we must not expand more, nor require we come back at
a lot extent to the case of our expressive familiarity of the course of environment. So far
as this involves expectation, tho that MAY signify repetition, it require, as we saw, mean little extra
than 'getting ready' in advance. But with several remote and prospect matter, our realistic
relations are to the last scale impending and distant. In no logic can we now get prepared for
seize of the earth's revolution by the tidal brake, for example;
and with the past, though we imagine ourselves to spot it precisely,
we have no realistic associations at all.

It is obvious that, although interests firmly sensible have been the unique starting-point of
our hunt for correct phenomenal descriptions, yet an inherent attention in the bare recitation
function has grown up. We hope the books that shall be correct, whether they carry collateral
return or not. The primitive purpose has developed itâs insist for simple work out. This theoretic
interest seems to be the characteristically human differentia, and
humanism recognizes its massive range.

A true plan now means not merely one that prepares us for a real awareness. It means also one
that might get ready us for a just likely perception, or one that, if spoken, would propose likely
perceptions to others, or recommend genuine perceptions which the lecturer cannot share. The
ensemble of perceptions thus thought of as either real or likely
form a scheme which it is clearly beneficial to us to get into a steady
and reliable form; and here it is that the common-sense view of lasting
beings finds winning use.

Beings acting exterior of the thinker explain, not simply his real perceptions, past and future,
but his likely perceptions and those of each one else. Hence they please our theoretic want in an
enormously dazzling manner. We pass from our instant genuine through them into the overseas
and the possible, and back again into the prospect actual, accounting for numerous facts by
a sole reason.

As in those circular panoramas, where a genuine foreground of grime, lawn, scrub, rocks and a
crashed cannon is enveloped by a canvas portrait of sky and earth and of a intense clash, continuing
the foreground so deceitfully that the viewer can notice no joint;
so these theoretical items, added to our current perceptual truth,
combine with it into the entire world of our faith.

  In spite of every berkeleyan censure, we do
  not doubt that they are actually present.

is the environs of insistent quarrels. Luckily, her uncle insists upon her present building,
and in the pedagogue, Avoid Botanist a new time begins for her. She is brought in impinging with

The prevarication is inferior to this righteous aim, and the earnestness of the communicator breaks

of sustenance and fun by way of help to the sadder narration. The characters are strongly drawn,

"I bet you can't do any better."
"I'm not trying to say anything" said Abner with a little bit of dignity. "If I were, I would

The need to unite his subjects as much as possible finally pushed Akbar to attempt to stabilize
religious differences as well. Convinced that religions did not differ from one another in their
care beliefs, he combined what in his opinion were the essential elements and about the year
fifteen eighty founded a new religion, the famous Din i llahi, the
"religion of god."

This certain religion only recognizes one God, a purely spiritual universal being who the human
soul is derived and towards which is leans. The ethics of this religion comprises the far too
high moral requirements of Sufism and Parsis; the complete toleration, equality of rights among
both men and woman, purity of thought, word and action. The demand of monogamy, too, was added
at a later date. Priest, images and houses of worship,--Akbar would have none of these in his
new religion, but from the Parsees he took the worship of flame and of the sun as to him light
and it's heat seemed the most beautiful symbols of divine spirit.[44]
He also adopted the holy cord of the Hindus and wore upon his forehead

and all the palliatives and affliction killers accepted to man were approved after avail,
and then, just as he was about to accord himself up for lost, an
abecedarian cornetist who active a flat on the attic aloft began to
play the Absent Chord.

A counter-pain set in immediately. At the additional bar of the Absent Chord the abominable
affliction that was gradually gnawing abroad at his belly seemed to lose its desolation in the
face of the greater suffering, and concrete abatement was instant.

the Doctor.

SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS
***** THE KING
Authentic telling of a plan, (now first publicised) for the capture
of Prince William Henry, his current Majesty, during his New York
stay in 1782; with the original writings of General Washington.

(From the Athenaeum.)

We must remember that as wild as this project appears, it was sanctioned by the deliberate judgment
of Washington; and it can't therefore be questioned, that his Royal Highness was, for a time,
in a situation of high and unknown danger.

We give it to our readers to discuss on the possible repercussions if the plan succeeded.

When his present Majesty William IV served as midshipman in the British navym he was on the coast
of North American colonies for some time, then in a revolution status,
and spent winter 1782 in the city of New York.

He is still held in memory by many elder people of the city, as a
fine bluff boy at 16 years old: frank, cheerful and affable, and there
are stories still told of his playful pranks on the ship poor protestant whom had declined from his
horse and done himself a number of severe sting which had evidently ended within derangement, arrived
towards a Catholic priest, declaring that he was possessed, and telling a story of almost dramatic
interest. In his sickness he had consulted a quack doctor, whom told
him that he could treat him via charms.

He wrote strange signs onto little fragments of paper, a number of of which were towards be
worn, a number of towards be devoured within bread and drunk within
wine.

These the destitute madman fancied later were charms via which he had unknowingly sold himself towards
the devil. The doctor, he fancied, had done so ahead of, and could alone redeem his own soul
via putting another within the power of Satan.

"I know that this is my condition," remarked the destitute madman, "by everybody I possess
sighted and heard, via everybody I possess suffered, via the distort which has robbed site
within me, which has at length carried me towards my show condition. All I cannot reveal; the
little I can and dare tell ought convince you.

Often has my tormentor pent me up within the oven, and lent me lie among the burning brands across
the live long night. Then I hear him within my torment talking loud, I know not what, again
my head. All prayer he forbids me, and he earns me tell whether I would grant everybody I possess
or my soul for my cure. Then he speaks towards me of the Bible; but he falsifies everybody he
informs me of, or he informs me of a number of new-born king or queen
within the kingdom of God.

I cannot go towards church; I cannot pray; I cannot think a nice
thought; I see sights of horror ever ahead of me, which fill me with
unutterable panic, and I know not what is rest; my one alone idea
is how soon the devil shall arrive towards allegation his miserable
victim and bring me towards the site of torment."

The destitute insect had a principle that a Roman Catholic priest
had the power of exorcism.

The priest was most kind towards the destitute maniac, and endeavoured
towards convince him of the power and goodness of God, and his relish
towards his creatures.

It need not be remarked that this was addressing the wind.

In fine, he remarked, "Well, I shall rid you of your tormentor.

He shall possess towards do with me, and not with you, within future."

This assure had the favourite effect; and the priest pursued it up via advising the maniac towards
go towards a nice physician, towards skirt solitude, towards profession steely, towards read his
Bible, and remember the comfortable declarations of which he had been just reminded, and whether
he was within any doubt or tensions, towards go towards his parish minister.

For the confused, Mr. Mansel of St. John's College, Oxon explained the paradox of "Achilles
and the Tortoise"

(Achilles and the Tortoise, Vol. ii, p. 154) in a note in the late
edition of Aldrich's Logic (p. 125, 1849).

In the note, Mansel shows the fallacy in the paradox is a material one, in that it is a false
assumption of the major premise, i.e., that the sum of an infinite series is always infinite. Rather,
such a sum may be finite.
To support his note, Mansel refers to p. 128 of Plato, Parmenid. [failing, of course, to specify

Making A Distributor- You require strip of fine aprroximately one inch wide (If you have strip
from old felt than it is excellent).  Thenyou have to roll it tightly. Just leave edges flat.
To make it smooth and even you have to rub the edges over the piece of sand paper.
Making Blue Powder- To make blue damar you have to take same amount of gum damar and white rosin. Also
require persian blue colour for colouring.  Mix them evenly. You can also use chrome yellow
powder, burnt sienna, lampblack, many more. You can improve black powder by adding small amount
of blue.
Making White Powder- Mix properly one ounce of white lead, half ounce of gum arabic in impalpable
powder. And half ounce white rosin in the fine powder.
Making Superior Dark Blue Powder- Mix properly one ounce of white
rosin, one and a half ounce of gum sandarac and one and half ounce
of Prussian blue in fine powder.

French Indelible Stamping- It is a best way for any kind of dark material. Keep in mind that
blue powder will be required.

For this process we require paint and brush instad of a pouncet and powder.
You can use both sides of the cloth but it will be best if you use the smoother side. Keep the
pattern down as if you are doing stamping. Now paint the perforations, ensure that lines are kept
sharp, clean ant distinct. Once the stamping is done you have to immediately clean the pattern.
Apply benzine and naphtha on the pattern so that paint is removed
from the pattern.

Later dry both the sides of pattern with a cloth. Or you can also use the cheapest way i.e.
machinist. Machinist is the thing use to clean the machines and it also absorbs the naptha and paintly
easily.

Check the pattern by holding it in front of the light. Remember if the holes are not clear then
wash it again.
Remember not to use the pattern immediately once it is washed as this will clog the perforations
because of the moistened gum.

Making The Paint- Add boiled oil to zinc white till it is formed like a cream.
Take a round board with a screw in the center so that tin pail can
be fitted into it.

You have to drop this on the paint so that it will not dry. Occassionally add oil in the paint
so that paint will not become thick and it is ready to use any time.
The Brush- You will require fine stensil brush or any brush with
a square end.

Wind it tightly with a string within one half inch of the end. It will help mix the paint well.
Remember to keep the brush in water so it will be prevented from drying. Before using brush
wipe it thoroughly.
How To Take Care Of Patterns- Rub smooth piece of pumice stone to
new patterns. It will take off the burr and help in stamping come
out cleaner and finer. Sometimes patterns are large so we have to
fold to them. Don't forget to iron the creases before it is used. 107 The Slave of Silence Chapter 1 The girl laid her head down on

is a might big job for one man to have done."

An Adventure in Civic and Private Art

Edward Bok now turned his attention to projects of a more public nature, which he felt could
contribute to improve the standard of public taste.

He was surprised, in talking with home designers, to learn the extent to which women with newly-rich husbands
would refer to certain styles of decoration which they'd seen in
the Pullman parlor cars. He had never seriously considered the influence
of these cars on the travelling public; now, he realized that, in
an aesthetic sense, they were very influential and unfortunately so.

In
those days, twenty years ago, Pullman parlor-cars sported atrocious
interior decor. Colors were in riotous discord; every foot of wood-panelling
was carved and ornamented with nothing left of the grain of even the
most beautiful woods; gilt was laid recklessly everywhere, regardless
of appropriateness. 

When written history takes a side --  when it praises or blames in order to  correct the perceived
injustice in what  actually happened (even though that's  futile) -- it doesn't do what it's
really  supposed to.

After all, the way things  unfolded was according to God's undoubtedly wise plan, however
unknowable. 

The latter is made with much ease from the strings, however the wood
industruments do not, in paticular the wood winds.

To produce a finely maintained piano from wind instruments is nearly impossible.
The fine instruments have been changed by the players, especially
the flautists, into forms of excellency (Gewaltsrohren).

The exceptions are our clarinetists, when they choose to use the "Echo Effect," and the French
oboists who have kept the pastoral character of their instrument in unaltered condition.

However there is a drawback, which is alive in our greatest orchesteras,
proposes a question: why are matters not compenstated at least by
the conductors by requiring a richer piano from the strings?

But no inconsistency is noticed by the condutors.
 

Disease of the body converts many of them.There are two reasons for the conversion that they were
non believers at will just because their desires have been suited it and second is because religious
nature and conscience are possessed by them.. I observe
it was no use, but I reflected I'd make a smash for it: so I got off my boots and ile-skins in
the water, and smacked aout for shoreline, that I could observe every
one time in a while on a rise.

"Wall, to make a long narrative short, I imagine I was in the water a subject o' four hours,
when I observe the lights of a schooner comin' daown on me.

I hailed, and she discovered me, ran up in the airstream, put aout a bot, and Sol Gillis, the skipper,
yanked me in. I couldn't have held aout 10 minutes longer. So Sol and me has been tol'able wide
ever since."

"Here he draws close naow," said the matron, whose speedy ear had snared the sound of close
to footsteps. "Sam, set aout my pennyroyal, will ye?

Ye see," she adjoined apologetically, "Sol is well-written, and when
he draws close raound he renders us all the journal, and there is
sech goin's on in the papers nowadays that it jest upsots my nerves
to learn him and Sam talkin' 'em over.

Sech slaughters, riots, wrackin', and killin' of folks! If it wa'n't for a container of tea
I 'low I couldn't learn to it." And the good woman held out her hand to a burly fisher in
a full fit of oil-skins, and submitted him to the sightseers as Sam's
acquaintance, Captain Sol Gillis.

"I'm a white-whaler at present, gentlemen," said the officer in accuse,
with a hearty jest that was so contagious that all hands united in,
scarcely recognising why.

He was a high, robust specimen of a down-Easter, his open face reddened
by long fighting with airstream and conditions, and trimmed close
except below the chin, from which was reliant an very large facial
hair that performed as a scarf in winter and even now was tucked into
his jacket.

 The school is named after a man who defended the right of all men and women to be
free, all through the years when people campaigned against slavery. It is a very suitable reminder
of his life, and its thirty years of wonderful service are indeed
a splendid way to commemorate all his humanitarian works. 

This may be shown to be relevant by observation alone, the noise always ceases when an insect lands
on any object. The sirene has been well applied for the purpose of knowing the rate at which the
wings of the insect flap. The instrument are tuned with the sound of the insect, the vibration.
Using this method it has been shown that the wings of a gnat flap at a rate of 15,000 hz.
The frequency of the note made by the insect while flying is more than two octaves above the highest
not of a seven-octave pianoforte. 

Is this present assembly of Ministers better than the usual ordinary

retribution for what they had endured at the hands of their opposition.
 

You have quite a wet cheek, and you are really shaking. You have feelings for me at all times. Your
presence makes everything bearable. The fact that he is leaving helps as well.

After the boys finally decided to go to bed after a long persuasion, Lord Newhaven sent for
his valet, told him what he wanted packed and what he wanted left, told him not to go with him,
and finally went to the ground floor and got into his sitting-room.
Scarlett has always struck me as a lucky woman, he said as he paced reslessly up and down the
room. She loves him.

She may marry him and ultimately change him. Is there any escape for him in this world and
the next, provided that there is a next? Is there such a thing as justice? Perhaps he figures at
this moment that the clearing of his conscience is a result of his offer to fight. After all,
if he wants to marry her, he will. There would be nothing I could do about it. He knows I can't
touch him, or sue for a divorce in fear of causing a scandal.

He has me, so he figures. Perhaps he is right. But if he thinks I am completely helpless, he is surely
mistaken. I might as well visit London and see if he is still up and around tomorrow night. It
is merely formal but I'll go.

I should've known she would attempt to smear her name, as well as the boys, if she could. She
will win, unless I exercise caution. Oh Lord, how did I marry a foolish woman who regards not
even her own interests. If I could go back in time and change things,
a Becky Sharp would be my wife or any other she devil. I wish she
showed more intelligence. Princess Louise, not following
the norm for British princesses, married the Marquis of Lorne in
1871.

Their daughter, six years later on October 24th, was baptised in the first royal christening
in Scotland for three hundred years.
The Duke of Edinburgh, Alred, married the sister of the Czar, and the only daughter of the then-deceased
Emperor of Russia. Cicero: "The more
virtuous any man is in himself the less easily does he suspect others

Don't leap to fanciful conclusions drawn without warrant. Remain true to your own understanding

The man whose head has been turned by poetry:

Ben Jonson said there's no hope for a young man infected with the taint of poetry. Indeed, he will
have his Shakespeare, his Burns, his Eliot, his Sandburg, God help us, his Dickinson, always
on the tip of his tongue or not much further back in his head, ready to inflict it upon the
world at the slightest provocation, or, indeed, excuse. His pleasure
in doing so is evident in his eyes, his tone of voice, even his very
posture and gesture, and is roughly in inverse proportion to the misery
he metes out. 

He is unaware, insensible, or inconsiderate of the
degree to which these un- called for, and uninspired parrotings make
him an object of ridicule. 

I knew a student years ago, so enamoured
of quoting poetry that I believe bits of rhyme and free verse were
all the education he had, apparently without even attribution. 

When,
by chance, he happened to recite a piece with which I was unfamiliar
and which had a less hackneyed content and more graceful form than
his usual fare, I inquired of him its author, he was entirely unable
to enlighten me, having adopted the child and forgotten the parent. "Come from the city?"
"Yes, Exeter, master."
Prior to questioning him anew, Hawthorne gazed at him: "Where could you buy the nicest apples
in Exeter?"
The boy teared up as he thought of his home: "Skim-milk Folsom, master."
 

As the ecclesiastical hierarchies are symbolized by the cities, the "mountains" and "islands"

with the sixth seal, when all they are "removed from its place" (6:14), and leaves the inhabitants
of the earth in a state of anarchy.

It is at this time that the kings and great men of the earth to be aware that the great day
of God's wrath has come, 6:15-17. In this time of trouble, comes the release of God's people

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks at our Booking-Office)
Herbert Beerbohm Tree (HUTCHINSON),I think that no other book will be giving a marvelous detail
of biography and as a whole it has a spectacular view from all sides
and on it's volumes are able to turn page after page very patiently.

Mr. MAX BEERBOBHM, brother of Herbert Beerbohm, has contributed in organizing this book and
clearly given an autobiography of his brother's life with Lady Tree, as she was known correctly
as Riverie. Almost 65 percentage of the narrations is in the form of paraises and honors collected
from close friends, mates and other outsiders.

However to say in short this book is that it gives a high feeling of "Joy". The very name daughter
FELICITY has been arrived as TREES is an apt one considering all aspects. He had an enchanting
life with gangs of friends,honored as victorious and won love, obedience
etc. which Macbeth could not enjoy the fragrance.

He had a stimulating British flavour, cleverness and brisk to share happiness and inspire people
around. I think no others have adopted his name in connection with such stories of entertainments
etc. However the Canada a la Press had given a false Poster, which
has not effected the reputation of lady "TREES" in spite of that,
this book is compiled of a lot of entertaining scenes.

Finally we have to look for more references on volumes but at the same time the autobiography
is his excellent creation and his passing away has created an emptiness.

MR. ARNOLD BENNETT, in his first chapter of Our Women(CASSELL) mention in irritation that his
ideas are not for researches.

He thinks that the title alone itself is a scientific guide, and warns otherwise, his duties are
rendered to the commons as a novelist, philosopher and author. The book, Our Dumb Friends, expidits
his views as an experienced zoologist, who explains about domesticated animals. This book has got
emphasis on begging in command and what would happen in due course of time. MR. BENNETT wants
the women of high class to become more alert in the freedom from the inhibitation of moral
or social activities and to become more and more free earning professionals rather than housekeepers
alone. He implies that ladies should have professionalism as a standby
if they continue to be unmarried.

Mr.BENNET also emphasizes that they should not be more expensive and they have a sustained position
as men's charm, as he is not for too much of changes and improvements in ladies.

This is about the story Spring Shall Plant(HODDER AND STOUGHTON), written by Miss.BEATRICE HARRADEN.
She might have even changed the name as The Success of a Naughty
Child.

The theme narrated in this story is about the victorious assistants of Patuffa. This name was given
to her as she often rus away from homes and schools or she was sent back with thanks. The
lively description given in this book inpires oldies to carry away this book for reading and wondered
as how this book has reached on my table, by mistake. In Coptic Street at Greece, godmother
of Patuffa, a Russian lady, by origin came from some where and settled
with others like her.

Now it is easy to understand that she also was a run away lady from other country and a spiritual
oldy of Bolshevism
 Finally, Dr. Hodge concluded bluntly, "While the moralist can take this position quite easily,
there are cases of purposeful deception which are not criminal. An example is shown above."
 

His intellect clear, positive convictions, his boundless energy, and his ardent enthusiasm, gave
him a powerful influence on the early days of the revolution, looking
towards a world rebuilt, but plunged into the dark depths of chaos
and is through this that we made a name among the women of France
said.

In more peaceful times peculiar talent, no doubt, led him to literature. In his best style she
has an unusual force and simplicity. It has moments of eloquent thought. There are flashes of her
in his letters soon to Sophie, who begs her friend not to burn, but she does not expect rival
Mme. de Sevigne, whom he takes for his model.

She lacked the grace, lightness, wit and humor of this model, but had a serious, serious depth
of thought that one does not find in Mme. de Sevigne. There was also a vein of sentiment that
was an underlying force in his character, but always subject to male
intellect.

She confesses that she wanted to be the chronicler of his country, and yearns for the pen of
Tacitus, for whom she has a true passion. When you read his sharp, incisive pen-portraits,
drawn with a vision so profound and masterful skill, one feels that
his true calling was in the world of letters.

In the fence that borders a bit on stage, as sometimes in his youth. But when she wrote her final
record his last hours he was running away. Life, with its large undeveloped possibilities and
promises, was behind it. The darkness was around him, the eternal silence before her. She had
lived, but thirty-nine.

Roland does not belong to the world of the salon, although she has been included among them some
of their own cotemporaries.
 

In the tenth 100 years a new sect originated entitled the "Ashariya" after Al-Ashari, its founder.
This was a party of moderation, and tended to conciliate orthodoxy
by not going too far in the main heading of rationalistic thinking.

They explained the difficulty by saying, "God understands through a information which is not
distinct from his essence." The other difficulty to which the MuÊ¿tazila dedicated their vigilance
was that of the fairness of God. This was in line with the efforts
of the Kadariya before them.

It worried itself with the doctrine of free will. They kept protected man's unconditional flexibility
of activity, and asserted on fairness as the only motive of God's dealings with men. God should
be just and will not proceed else than in agreement with justice.

In quotation to the inquiry of the environment of good and bad, the
orthodox place was that good is that which God instructions, bad that
which God forbids.

In other phrases, not anything is in itself good or bad, the ethical
feature of an proceed is solely relation to God's mind-set to it.

If God were to order cannibalism, it would be a good act. The MuÊ¿tazila were are against to
this. They accepted in the unconditional feature of good and evil. What makes an proceed good or
awful is cause, and it is because an proceed is good that God instructions it, and not the reverse.

The
foregoing account devotes us an concept of the environment of the MuÊ¿tazilite considerations
of the two difficulties of God's harmony and God's justice.

Their works were all organised in the identical way. They were split up into two components,
one considering with the inquiry of the harmony, and the other with that of justice. The verifications
of the harmony were preceded by the verifications of God's reality, and the last cited were
founded upon a demonstration that the world is not eternal, but bears finds of having arrive
to be in time.

These are the earmarks by which a MuÊ¿tazilite publication could
be identified, and the esteem for them on the part of the philosophers,
i. e., the Aristotelians, was not great.

The last cited did not address them worthy battlers in a philosophical battle, asserting that
they came with preconceived notions and organised their conceptions
of environment to match the devout convictions which they yearned
to defend.

 The claims of human duty are benevolence,suffering and
disappointment. Forgotten in sleep, press with new weight on weary hearts. One hour has made mighty
changes.  During night heathenism and wickedness will rule over.

But once morning comes everything will be bright. Similarly nations
once wrapped in gloom are waking to life and truth. For every organism there is always a possibility
of death. Never in history has there lived an organism which never had a possibility for death.
Monerons are no exceptions. According to Christian belief, Divinity is the originator of all
life forms, he who lives forever.
Stalwarts like Darwin or Heckel never came with such a nonsense thought either; nor did they
ever mention that life-germs always live. So no, monerons are not
life germs that can live for an inifinite term. 

One of the first flowers to bloom in spring, the pink and white blossoms
of Trailing Arbutus, linger in my memory for their simple beauty.

As a child I recall that it grew near to the stream that ran by my
father's cottage door.

I would build tiny water wheels and play with them in the sparkling
cold water as the breeze gently ruffled the Arbutus blossoms and the
sweet scent filled my nostrils.

I can't smell that fragrance today without being transported in my
mind to those happy days.

 

MR. JOSEPH S. ROPES'S SPEECH.

FELLOW-CITIZENS,--I want to thank everyone for giving me the honor
to be here in this special occasion.

We are here all together, not to speak badly of each other, not to
abuse the other candidates but to consult each other in a friendly
and constructive matter about a very important issue--the public parks
of the city of Boston.

(Applause.) 
Gentlemen, I am a child of Boston; and I remember
vividly the good old time.

These were the times when the Back Bay was a reality, when the green
field dominated everywhere and when our cous were pastured on them.

 TENNYSON. THE U.S. of A. AT WAR--THEATER:
FRANCE Appropriated, with a smattering of abridgements and alterations in language, from General
Pershing's report made to the Secretary of War on November 20, 1918. We had a meeting to discuss
the most advantageous ways of mutual cooperation. There are in divergent parts
niches which erstwhile held the sanctified liquid, by which the sanctimonious
devotees of sometime ages wet their foreheads on their ingress before
the altar, I am not sensitive that any different relic of the old
church are now seeable in this chapel.

Expiration finished the east end of the southeasterly aisle, a duo
of gates leads into the Virgin Mary's Chapel."

From what we think of the persona of this Chapel, the lovers of
structure acquire minuscule to bewail in its remotion.

Our Journalist, E.E., adds--"This, and not the Mohammedan Chapel,
it was, (No. 456 of The Mirror,) that contained the stone of one Bishop
Wickham, who, yet, was not the famous builder of Windsor Manse, in
the experience of Prince III., but died in 1595, the synoptical twelvemonth
in which he was translated from the see of Lawyer to that of Winchester.

His memorial, now lying unprotected in the yard, businessman the south-east
crossing of the parcel of the aforementioned Magdalen Chapel."

English Saving.

SHAVINGS V. Humate AND PEAT.

(To the Application.)  
Without intending to be tempestuous, tolerate
me to inform your well-meaning newspaperman, M.L.B. that his observations
on the inhabitants of "Auld Reekie," are something equal the master
of his connectedness "Shavings," kinda dilettante.

Imprudence forms no attribute in the English eccentric; but your air tourer charges "the gude sept
o' Embro'" with unnatural wastefulness in making bonfires of their carpenters' chips; and proceeds
to reflect in the legitimate disposition of excellence how such outmatch
it would bed been if the builders' chips had been victimized in lighting
menage fires, to the evidently outstanding saving of bundle-wood,
than to hold thus promiscuously strained them to act their gases on
the desert air.

But your traveller forgot that in countries which bristle in cereal,
rye is seldom eaten; and that on the self prescript, in Scotland,
where fragment and peat are galore, the "natives," similar the ancient
Vestals, never  portion their fires to go out, but keep them oxidization
finished the whole nighttime.

The commercialism of the "gude man" is, immediately before effort
to bed, to encumbrance the supply with coals, and crest the ply with
a "canny passack o' land," which keeps the complete in a nation of
elevate burning; when, in the start a rugged compel from the cards,
produces an fast brightness.

But, regrettably, should any untoward "o'er-night clishmaclaver"
opportunity the miss of this responsibility, and the onset be port,
similar resentment, to nutrient upon its own organ, a medicine is
at  deal in the cast of a pan "o' untaped coals" from several statesman
prudent soul, medico in an stimulant or modify "unstimulating;" and
thusly without bundle-wood or "shavings," is the shenanigan processed.

I hope that this account give sufficiently uphold my English friends
from M.L.B.'s depreciation.

Scotchmen myopic! never: for workhouses are as meagre among them as bundle-wood, or brainy travellers.
Recollect that I am not in a suffering; but this I will say, tho'
the pass compact me, that M.L.B. strongly reminds me of the Land princess,
who when she heard of few manufacturers demise in the provinces of
hungriness, said, "Insufficient fools! die of starvation--if I were
them I would eat dough and cheeseflower eldest."

The succeeding dimension M.L.B. visits Scotland, let him ask the basic goth he meets how to rest eggs clean
for years; and he testament result rub a emotional oil or butter over them, within a day or
two after parturition, and they give record any size of measure, perfectly impertinent. This deed,
which was made in Author by the outstanding Reamur, depends for its success upon the oil filling
up the pores of the egg-shell, and thereby excerpt off the activity
between the fluids of the egg and the weather, which is a necessary
agent in decay.

The saving of eggs in this demeanour, has  tall been experienced in all "braiding Scotland;"
but it is not so untold as proverbial in our own boasted job of limp
eggs and bundle-wood.

 The pen or mouth can hardly express the number and magnitude of injuries and
injustices suffered by the inhabitants of this coast from 1510 to the present. I will only tell
a few of the wicked and savage acts of the highest kind, which show all of the other crimes
that deserve the worst punishments, and clear a path for the needed punishment of these.
In the year 1510, a nameless pirate and his crew of around 65 came to Trinity Island. This island
is greater than that of Sicile in virility and size, and is in the same continent on the side that
touches Paria. It's inhabitants, by their own admonition, are more
fair and just than those on their same continent.

These other continentals, Indians, brought a decree that the inhabitants of Trinity Island should
come live with them. They recieved a warm and suave reception from the Indian rulers and subjects,
and were served with stylish flair. They were given all of their day to day needs with so much
excess that they could have supported even more islanders, because
it is the tradition among these New World Indians to give their guest
Spaniards a bounty of their necessities.

Shortly thereafter, the Spaniards built a large house, capable of
housing the Indians, to allow them to complete their original intentions.

When the Indians had started to thatch it and achieved a height of
12 feet, the Spaniards trapped them there.

They claimed it would speed the work, but in truth it was meant to alientate them to those outside.
Part of the Spaniards surrounded the house, swords drawn, and the others entered. They bound
the Indians and threatened them with death if they moved. If any Indian tried to escape, he
was chopped to pieces. However, some Indians, both injured and not, managed to escape with others
who were not in the house. About three hundred of these Indians went to another house, armed
with bow and arrow, and entered. After they entered the house, the Spaniards locked all the
doors and threw fire into the house, and the Indians in the house all perished. From there, the
Spaniards set sail to St John island with 180 slaves they had taken. They sold half of these
slaves, then returned to Hispaniola where they disposed of the other
half.

When I accused this captain of evilness and vicious actions after the arrival in St John island,
he told me this: Calm down, sir. I was given these instructions by the people who sent me
here, that I should overtake them under the pretense of Peace, and I could not take them through
force alone. This captain also himself told me that while he was in Trinity Island he had
met with a Priest and a nun in the most common usage. He told of his confusion and confessed his
sins to these two. At one time, the Monks of St Dominic had held a meeting about sending one of
their brothers to the island, so that their preaching could lead
the Indians to their Christian faith and tell them how to be saved,
which the Indians did not know of.

They decided to send a religious theologist, also known as a Doctor in Divinity, to the island.
This man was famous for his holiness and virtues, accompanied by an associate, to visit the country,
talk to the Indians, and determine the best placement for future
monastaries.

 

  One gap, unseen to all but our self in the
    mass and chaos of the world,
  and every thing is changed. In a single
    hour, the whole procedure of thought, the whole ebb and flow of sentiment,
may be revolted for the rest of a survival. 

  In the first, between two Ionic columns of
    three quarters, were the real
  weapons, and both sides were the City
    and Sir Thomas, on the north side, but not exactly in the center,
rose a Corinthian column of about same height of the tower forehead
crowned with the grasshopper.

In all other respects similar to South, from which the engraving is a preview.  More from the
gallery were stores, which rose by two staircases in the north and south. Above the stairs were
about [1] a hundred shops, ranging from 2-3/4 to 20 feet wide and forming a kind of bazaar, then
called the Pawn. These stores, the first two or three years has not met the expectations of
its founder, for such was the force of habit, the merchants, despite all the inconveniences
attending Lombard street, could not be induced to use the new shopping center.
[1] From the Vestry old book belonging to SanMichael also learn the rents of the shops, which
were at first only forty shillings, in the course of a few years rose to four marks, pounds
after four, and then the fire that is left ten shillings per foot.

The building had been opened two or three years, when the Queen signified their intention to
pay an inspection visit, but many shops remain vacant, Sir Thomas found it necessary to turn retailers
and ask them to "provide and goods and garnish with wax lights, in
Shoppes until it is or may woulda, and have all supplied in this form
of free rent for yeare.

" - Stowe.
His Majesty the appointed day (January 23, 1570), having dinner with the founder, in his house
in Bishopsgate Street, again by way of Cornhill, and entered the south side and have seen that
expressed very happy, and with the national spirit which so eminently
his distinguished, ordered that instead of foreign name bag, in which
citizens had begun to call it, should be styled, in plain English
- the real exchange - which was proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet:
-  
"Proclaim through every street in the city, this place no longer
called Burse;!

  But since the building is stunning, right,
    and strange, either call
  ever - The Royal Exchange" [2]
    [2] The second part of "Queen Elizabeth problems" - a play by Mr.
T. Heywood, 1609.

The building could not have been very important, because by entering the room Wardbook of Cornhill,
we find that in 1581, not fourteen years after its completion, some
of the arches of the gallery were in a situation of insecurity, and
the lives of passing under the traders were in danger.

And even more - in 1603 another entry states that the east and north walls were also in poor
condition, so he continued trying to repair even more, in which the Company Mercers' spent
large sums of money, until it was destroyed in entirely in the Great Fire of 1666.
Sir Thomas Gresham, by his will, he left the building, his house in Bishopsgate Street, the
firm of Mercer and the Corporation of London, in common trust: the house as a university, and
the products of the Exchange to pay, firstly, the salaries of teachers
and other college expenses, and secondly, of certain quantities to
different hospitals, prisons and houses charities.

Such was the origin of the Royal Exchange. After its destruction in 1666, funds in the hands of
Sir Thomas Gresham trustees amounted to no more than Â£ 234. 8s. 2d., But with a spirit beyond all
praise, who contributed their own resources the amount needed to rebuild the stock, which was completed
and opened September 28, 1669, the total cost of Â£ 58,962 that,
which City Corporation and the Company Mercers' borne equally between
them.

Since that period it has undergone several repairs, but a more complete and important was started
in 1820 under the direction of Mr. Geo.

Smith, architect of the firm Mercer, the estimated cost of which was nearly Â£ 33,000, and
stairs in the north, south and west have been built of stone, at a cost of around Â£ 6,000.

At the initial stage of the Renaissance period,there is no any italian city, its the city of

 When Rufinus heard the word races, he looked up from his writing and
said "I will come, if I can get leave." 
"I wasn't aware you cared
about that kind of thing," said Cephalus. 
Ruinus blushed and mumbled
something about going from time to time. To follow the property
throughout all of its possessors is not needed. During the Henry VIII reign Thomas Howard owned
the property, being the first Duke of Norfolk. The castle was reverted back to the crown due
to the attainder of his son. Not long after this event, it was given to Sir John Byron for a
total of fifty years. Earl of Shrewsbury, Gilbert Talbot, owned Bolsover, during the reign
of James I. In 1613 Gilbert Talbot sold the property to Sir Charles Cavendish, whose son William
being the oldest, was the first Duke of Newcastle, a person of very high status among the nobles
of this time, and held in very high regard at court. He was devotedly close to his royal master,
Charles I, whom he provided entertainment for at Bolsover Castle, in a manner of royal greatness,
on three occasions. 

We can't credit the assertion of the Tribune's Correspondent on his opinion that Erard, Pleyel,
and Hertz prefer the quality of American Pianos. We can however,
believe that the players in Paris believe this to be so. 

Seeing the presents that i gave to their companion, the other girls and the woman felt scandalized

(2.) Greeks, related to Helli, Selli, [Greek: selas, Heule, Helios]. This derivation is more
likely {28} by the fact that the neighboring tribes Pelasgic have a similar meaning, eg
PerrhÃ¦bi similar to Pyrrha and [Greek: com]; Ãthices, [Greek aith] TymphÃ¦i, [Greek: tuphÃ´]
HestiÃ¦i, [Greek: Hestia].
Add to this that the name of Fthiotida certainly seems to get his name Phthah, the Egyptian
Hephaestus, and a translation of the word Hellas.

NB - The existence of an Egyptian colony in that part is attested by the existence of a ThebÃ¦
Phthiotic.
(3.) Moreover, the word seems to be related Achaean [Greek: ACHOS, achnumai] and [Greek: achlus]
in the sense of melancholy (the [Greek: ACHOS ouranion]).
So the Cimmerians of Homer are derived from [Hebrew: KIMRIYRIY] (Job), which denotes the dark.

(4. ) Finally, I present with great suspicion the next test of Doro words and Aeolian MinyÃ¦,
I'm going to try to derive from words denoting the sun and moon respectively.
I suppose the Doro word to be connected to the first part of the names on dry sole proprietors
and sole proprietorships Dol. Metathesis in the first case seems sanctioned by the analogy of
IRD Sanskrit and Greek [Greek: Deiro] lyr mutation and the second is very common in Greek and Latin
to admit of any doubt, for example, [Greek: ar-Gale] and [Greek:
algaletos] Soracte Sun. With this premise, I think it can be justified
in connecting the words together. 

My-ang-a: a housefly. Mong: any species of ant. Man-a-ro: Belly Button. Moo-tang: Living. Me-gal:
Water from crying eyes. Ma-na-ran: Kangaroo teeth applied to the head as an ornament. Mawn:
a ghost, or ghostly apparition.

Moono: a bird's bill. Mo-ro: a trail or road. Min-ney: to scrape. Myi-mogro: to close one's
eyes. Maur: to grab. Narrong: something small. Nowey: a canoe. Narrong nowey: the source. Narra-dew:
to hear. Noone: immediately. Nogur: a nose. Naga: a liver. Nar-a-mee: a net. Nan-ga-ra: to slumber.

Lord Kames in the "Elements of Criticism"  says that these are the rules of how a line of hexameter
poetry needs to be laid out. As a matter of fact, according to my personal experience, so many Presidents, statesmen,
senators, congressmen had been raising and again falling down in their another chance, number of
political administrators had been changing and numerous good, bad and weak public men has
been coming and passing away. But Godkin is the only person who has been preaching us a timely
sound sermon every week to us. Among the Algonquins a sick individual is supposed to hold his shadow
or other self temporarily moderate from his object, and the convalescent is at times "reproached
for exposing himself before his shadow was safely settled down in him. If the sick buddy
has been plunged into stupor, it is because his other self has travelled away as far as the edge
of the river of death, but not being allowed to crotchety has come back and re-entered him. And
stagecraft upon a equivalent 
belief the tender Fiji bequeath sometimes
lie down and nurse a hue and cry for his spirit to be brought back.

Thus, continues Mr. Tylor, "in varied countries the bringing back of missing souls becomes a
repeatitive refund of the enchanter 's or cleric's occupation." [164] On Aryan speck we
find the belief of a makeshift emigration of the spirit lasting to a behind date in the philosophy
that the crone may attend the infernal Sabbath while her secular tabernacle is quietly sleeping
at home.

The primeval concept reappears, clothed in bitterest crabbedness , in Dante's passage to
his living contemporaries whose souls he met with in the vaults of hell, while their bodies
were calmness motile about on the burrow, inhabited by devils. The philosophy which identifies
the spirit with the shadow, and supposes the shadow to depart with the malady and death of the
object, would seem explainable to be attended with some difficulties in the method of verification,
even to the shadowy intelligence of the bestial. But the propriety of identifying spirit and
breath is borne out by all primeval experience. The breath, which really quits the object at its
decease, has furnished the central adduce for the spirit , not only to the Hebrew, the Sanskrit,
and the classic tongues; not only to German and English, where geist, and ghost, according to
Max Muller, hold the meaning of "breath," and are relevant to such talking as gas, gust, and geyser;
but also to numerous barbaric languages. Among the natives of Nicaragua and California, in Java
and in West Australia, the spirit is described as the orchestration
or breeze which passes in and out through the nostrils and hole ;
and the Greenlanders, according to Cranz, reckon two separate souls,
the breath and the shadow.

[165] It is kept up, too, in Lancashire, where a well-familiar crone died a few years since;
"but before she could'dodder off this mortal reckoning ' she must needs TRANSFER HER FAMILIAR SPIRIT
to some trusty successor. An confidential acquaintance from a neighbouring township was consequently
sent for in all haste, and on her arrival was immediately closeted with her dying buddy 
.
What passed between them has never fairly transpired, but it is confidently affirmed that at
the confidential of the interview this associate RECEIVED THE WITCH'S LAST BREATH INTO HER MOUTH
AND WITH IT HER FAMILIAR SPIRIT. The dreaded female thus ceased to exist, but her powers for righteous
or dishonesty were transferred to her buddy
; and on ephemeral along the road from Burnley to Blackburn we can speck out a farmhouse at
no revered distance with whose miserly matron no neighbouring farmer bequeath yet dare to
quarrel. [166]
Of the philosophy of embodiment there bequeath be stratum to speak other on. At adduce pact
us not defile over the fact that the other self is not only conceived
as shadow or breath, which can at times cease the object during life,
but is also supposed to become temporarily embodied in the recognizable
manipulate of some lass or beast.

In discussing elsewhere the romance of Bishop Hatto, we saw that
the spirit is sometimes represented in the manipulate of a rat or
mouse; and in treating of werewolves we noticed the effect that the
spirits of dead ancestors, borne along in the night-wind, hold taken
on the semblance of howling dogs or wolves.

"Consistent with these quaint ideas are ceremonies in vogue in China
of bringing home in a cock (live or unnatural) the spirit of a buddy
deceased in a distant recognize, and of tempting into a sick buddy
's coat the departing spirit which has already left his object
and so conveying it back."

[167] In Castren's revered inspect
on Finnish mythology, we find the facts of the vast

who could not be killed because he kept his spirit dormant in a twelve-headed snake which he
carried in a bag as he rode on horseback; only when the incongruity
was discovered and the snake carefully killed, did the vast 
yield
up his life.

 No one
needs to be afraid, caught by the cunning bait, this book, to be ensnared on it as a hook. Gladly
from you, I'm lured to say with things that seemed vile before, for
you did so poorly before, what matter the wisest might hear.

 During the last eight years I
have passed a least six 100 nights in your home, and have been very regularly in your sleeping-room,
and have discovered your private chat with your wife.

Doubt it, perform you? Yes, your entrance was perpetually bolted on the indoors, and no other one
opened into your bedchamber, but I can advise you talks you had with
your wife, which will argue you.

Do you consider one after dark when your wife became uneasy and plunged to weeping lest the
hurt she sensed in her breast should confirm to be a malignant illness,
and you advised her that you would depart to Boston with her and consider
Dr. Jackson and request Dr. P. to depart with you?

Do, eh? And perform you consider one after dark when your niece snoozed upon the settee in your
room? I had no thought she was there, and needlessly waked her. She yelled, and while you
was joining to her dread I slid out and didn't move out your entrance bolted. I discovered you
advise her she was dreaming.

"And manage you recall one evening telling your wife that you could not envisage how three
cigars got out of a new carton you had opened the evening before? Those cigars were the only
things that either Maguire or I ever took from your house.  "I will make you this proposition,
and if you will accept it you will manage well. By the evening train my two accomplices in that
job will arrive. I don't propose to be closed up till they come. I will yield for six men
to sit up with me here to-night in this agency, and you will choose them, and in the forenoon
I will yield their charges and proceed to jail."  The proposition was acknowledged, and the
head of policeman furnished the keepers. During that night time
Mr. Burchard's office was the view of unusual revelations.

Malcolm furnished currency to one of the officers, any person who brought in a basket of champagne,
and lucid a supper at one o'clock in the morning, to be the bulk achieve that currency could
pay for and the city furnish. The officers were at liberty to invite in their associates any person
who were reliable. Malcolm dispersed to each of his keepers five times the sum of currency equated
upon for their earnings, and appealed of them a faithful performance of their duty. Some thirty had
entered the office, and the door was sealed and not to be opened
on any account assertion till supper was announced.

Malcolm had sent to a neighboring bookstore, and accepted one crowd in of every edition of
playing cards there saved for sale. Some forty packs with dissimilar backs were piled higher
at one end of the table. Malcolm invited numerous one to take a hand of euchre with him. The captain,
any person who was examined the bulk guru performer, took a stool at the corner of the office
desk, and the unwind were to discern the game, but say none which they ought investigate till

A short moment later a loud sound came from overhead- the slaming

A Linden tree is surrounded by evergreens, creating a lovely smell.

Over to the right side, there are the tombs of Gretry, a great musician,
Fourcroy, a well known chemist, Boileau, Racine, and of Mademoiselle
Raucourt.

Raucourt was a popular actress who was not allowed burial in consecrated ground in 1815 in
accordance with a decision of the clergy. Many were dissatisfied with the circumstances this
created.  Even after such controversy over the clergy's refusal to bury Raucourt, these decisions
still continued after the restoration of Louis XVIII.

At that point the right of conscrated ground was denied to a comedian.
Near Raucourt's tomb is an unassuming gravesite, surrounded by roses, lillies, and tufts of well
tended mignonette. The memorial was a plain marble column shaded by an accacia and engraved
with the following story. The column marks the place where a number of students from the Paris
Polytechnical School occupied the ground, in order to defend it from invading forces in 1814.
One can still see the marks on the surrounding walls made by the soldiers muskets. The battle
that occurred at the spot was very deadly, with many casualties on
both sides.

The student-soldiers defeated many Prussian soldiers, but eventually surrendered.
In the cemetary at Vaugirard my childhood friend and fellow officer, Captain Wright, is buried.
He was murdered in the Temple after leading a brave life.
At first I had looked for his grave in Pere la Chaise, where I had heard he was buried. All
I found there was an inscription written about him by the great Sir
Sidney Smith: 
Here Lies Inhumed John Wesley Wright, by birth an
Englishman, Captain in the British Navy.

He was distinguished by his felow Englishmen and by foreigners for his skill and bravery;
To them, he would have done anything demanded of him, should the opportunity arise.
He honored the virtues of his ancestors with his actions.
He was quick and bold in understanding and executing orders;

If faced with success, he was modest. In hard times he was persistent. When things were uncertain,
he was cautious and wise.
After having some success in his career, he was blown off course and
captured on a hostile shore.

Soon after being taken to Paris, he was locked up in the prison known as the Temple, an infamously
dangerous place. He was placed under close guard there.

In his captivity and under influence of torture his patriotism and mental fortitude remained
unquestionable.
After some short time, he was found one morning in his bed. His throat had been slit. He died
on the 28th of October 1805, at the time, he was only 36 years old. He will be mourned by his
Nation, and Avenged by the grace of God.
The Donjon, or Castle of Vincennes.
This ancient castle sits near the start of the forest of Vincennes.

What was once a forest is now reduced to a small wooded area after the timbers were put to
use during the revolution. The castle is surrounded by a wide, deep ditch, about two miles from
the Barriere du Trone.
Over the years, it was the informal home of the royalty of France.
Philip de Valois build an extensive addition to the home in 1337.
John also built up the residence, and it was finally finished by Charles, son of John and regent
of the kingdom.

During the rule of Charles VII in 1422, Henry VI of England died in this same place.
From that time, Vincennes was the royal home, until Louis XIV's reign began. Of course he then
occupied Versailles, and Vincennes became a prison.
[Footnote 13: Monstrelet tells an odd story of the time he spent living
in the Castle of Vincennes of Isabeau de Baviere.

It is an example of the difficult and cruel standards of the time period. "Lewis de Bourbon,
who was an atttractive man, had several times distinguished himself at the battle of Agincourt.
On one evening he went to visit Queen Isabeau de Baviere, at the
Castle of Vincennes, as was the custom. Bourbon met King Charles VI,
and saluted him without getting off of his horse or even stopping.
When the king remembered the incident he ordered Tangui du Chatel,

San Domingo Improvement Company, an American corporation under contract with the government
took over customs collections, in order to provide services to credit. Illegal imprisonment
of several French has created friction with the French government
and in 1894 a French fleet appeared before City of Santo Domingo,
but the problem has been adjusted by an indemnity.

Long enjoyed comparative peace under the leadership of President Ulises Heureaux country, or
"Lilis," as the dictator was known, apparently brought progress and prosperity, albeit at a heavy price.
Many of his opponents Heureaux was able to buy, and in this way he kept the loyalty of hundreds
of little military chiefs scattered throughout the country. Those whom he could not buy him
persecuted, imprisoned, exiled or executed. While possessing good and affable manners, he was relentless
in his persecution of the conspirators and many stories are told
of his harshness in this regard.

NIGHTHAWKS
The nighthawk, Chordeiles minor, is frequently mistaken for the smaller Caprimulgus vociferus.
Beginning in April it flies north to North America, where it is also known as the Mosquito Hawk or Bullbat.
In August it returns to the West Indies, southern hemisphere, and by October it disappears entirely
from the United States.

According to Major Bendire, this migration gives it a range that extends throughout the Americas.

Although Chordeiles minor is commonly called the nighthawk, it is not in fact nocturnal. It flies
on both sunny and cloudy days, reserving its hunting times for the latter. During the new moon,
it returns to its nest deep in the woods after sunset.

When the moon is full and visible, it will continue flying until well towards midnight. 
One
observer notes of the nighthawk, "This is one of the most beautiful
birds I have come to see.

At first it will glide like a craft without any wing-movement, but
in the blink of an eye it begins flapping its wings quickly like a
falcon.

When it catches the eye of an insect, it can propel itself straight
upwards, as if shot from a bow.

Its tail can grow in size to assist these twists and turns."
 Once upon a time, the Master of Life took two pieces of clay and formed
them into two feet that resembled the paws of a panther.

He put his own feet into the clay forms and found them both comfortable and practical as they
offered him the ability to move stealthily with great speed. Next he molded for himself a
pair of very tall legs and watched them walk.

Pleased with his creations, he went on to create a round torso covered with the scales of an alligator.

He was so nice as towards confide towards me that three things were
offered towards him,--the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, Secretaryship
at War, or a seat at the Treasury, via distance of introduction towards
the lids, whether he was concerned of entering upon them at once.

These bids were, however, within the alternative of there being any
of them deteriorated via Milnes (Member for Pomfret), towards whom
they were made within the former instance.

Lord P. consulted me very frankly upon them, and asked whether I
idea he would be equal towards the lids either within Cabinet or Parliament,
notably the latter, whereas he had barely made his dÃ©but.

I told him, and was most sincere, that within ordinary with everybody
his allies whom I had ever heard speak onto the issue, I idea him
relatively equal towards them within degree of capacity, but as towards
nerves within Parliament, (of which he appeared most towards doubt,)
nobody could adjudicate but himself.

He remarked, Petty (whom I had mentioned) had arrive forward as soon
as having felt his distance and got possession of himself within the

not hesitate.

As it was, he sloped towards the second site, but had composed towards

lateral leaflets that are smaller than leaves of plants in the same genus. These leaves only
appear on the plant when it is in the growing stages, and once the
plant is full grown these leaflets fall off.

However, these leaflets aren't on seedlings, and only appear on the plants once 10 to 20 normal
leaves have been formed. Sometimes only one of the leaflets is grown,
and sometime they are both absent. The builder of the far-famed

BARRY PAIN. Wrote many well-known poems and parodies, such as "Eliza" and other adventure stort
stories and novels.

SIR GILBERT PARKER wrote "The Judgement House" and "The Right of Way," among other romantic novels
and poems. He was born in Canada.
EDEN PHILLPOTTS is known best for his exact portraits of the English
rustic. He is a realistic novelist and author of "Down Dartmoor Way."

SIR
ARTHUR WING PINERO wrote the plays, "Sweet Lavender" and "The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray." He is one of the most popular living dramatists. Even though he failed to take hold of large things, according to the nourished
suggestions of great scientific researchers like Humboldt, Darwin,
and Alfred Russell Wallace, he was very much interested, well informed,
hard-working and understanding on their suggestions.

Even though he was a well trained anthropologist and he was capable to research on personal relations
with the Tasmanian blacks, his valuable writings was merited with great value and they were quite
interesting to read.

    Tasmanian blacks were belonging to
  a traditional race and now they had become died due to the negative
contact of European civilization.

In his whole writing, in nearly two pages, he was narrating about
personâs first meeting with the aboriginals - especially when they
had been longing for pure water to drink and the amazement of the
savages like an incident with delightful humor etc., during their
encounter by white people.

But at the same time, they were showing very close relationship and
careful observation also.

It was highly appreciable and welcomed by the reader.

LOC. "In going up the Barrier Range near the Darling, approximately 500 feet above the river."
D. Sturt.
OBS. In July, 1817, Mr. Allan Cunningham, who went along with Mr. Oxley when he first went to
the Western Interior of New South Whales, found his Clianthus Oxleyi
on the easternmost shore of Regent's Lake, on the River Lachlan.

Mr. Eyre, in 1893, found an identical plant on the Gawler Range,
which wasn't too far from the endpoint of Spencer's Gulf.

It was also noticed not too long ago by Captain Sturt, on his Barrier
Range close to Darling.

All the species in these localities are one-and-the-same, I am quite
sure of it.

Mr. Cunningham accompanied Captain King and they found a plant which seemed, to him, quite similar
to the one that had previously been found at Regent's Lake.

He recorded the plant's description in his journal:

"I found Kennedya speciosa (what he originally called the Clianthus Oxleyi) on a sterile bleak
flats, near Regent's Lake, on Lachlan, the river I am currently on. The location is 33 degrees
13 minutes S and long 146 degrees 40 minutes E. There were not many of the plants, and only
one was flowering. The French call this island "Isle Malus".

Mr. Cunningham didn't realize from Dampier of the previously available figure and description.
But in 1833, in a communication to the Horitcultural Society, that he had found a distinct
species. This idea was probably imparted to him by the article in Don's System of Gardening
and Botany vol. 2. p. 468, which describes a third genus. This third genus has a specimen in Mr.
Lambert's possession, in his Herbarium, and is said to have been
discovered by Captain King at Curlew River.

It was called Clianthus Dampieri by the discoverer. The characteristics include leaves of a different
form and racemes instead of umbels. He refers to Dampier's description, which indicate that
the flowers as umbellate, when he is referring to the Clianthus Oxleyi. But he was wrong. The are
not umbellate. I have encountered specimens that are corymbose, and I have examined both speicmens
extensively and where they currently reside. However, they have gone missing. They have been bequeathed
to relatives of the previous owners."
I have found several specimens since that description was written. One was at Sir William Hooker's
Herbarium. There I saw two specimens of Clianthus, which Mr. Bynoe found, on the Northwest
coast of Australia when he was in the beagle. These are identical to Dampier's, as they are
similar in shape and leave structure, and in their subumbellate inflorescene with the plant
of the Lachlan, Darling, and the Galwer Range.

You will notice that when the pods are half ripe, they are more clearly visible as the intended
plant.

But it is sufficiently different when the pods have ripened to prove it is different from the original
to be a new genus. I believe this genus should be the Eremocharis,
based on its ornamentation of the desert region of inner Australia,
and the sterile islands of the Northwest coast. Dr. Morgan in a paper entitled "Moral Philosopher, or a dialogue between Philalethes
a Christian deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew," follows closely
in the footsteps of the outer room.

Like him, he insisted on absolute perfection of natural law or religion, in which Christianity
is just a republication. As he confessed himself a Christian deist and vigorous protest against
being considered to be an enemy to Christianity. But his work is inferior tend all respects.
It is a poorly written book.

It is mainly directed against the Hebrew economy. But Morgan has a much wider range than this,
embracing the Old Testament, which he seems to read back finding objects of admiration in what
is set before us as objects of reprobation and vice versa.
But though dealing primarily with Morgan Old Testament, he aruncÄ considerable doubts third
volume in November. Realized the life of Christ, moreover, that of His Resurrection, and above all,
through his apostles wrought miracles, all are thrown into discredit. [157]
Overall, this book marks a distinct epoch in the history of English
Deism.

There is not the word, indeed Morgan, which have not been insinuated by one or other of his
predecessors, but it marked the point of being told that now was
not only insinuated.

The tone throughout the book shows "the beginning of the end", not far distant, that purpose
being Lechler what he calls "the dissolution of Deism in Skepticism."
But there is still more to an author whose works have noticed yet been written in previous vein
Deism. He came to a strong conclusion that Hermione must have natural instinct
with every emotion, after the Hermione scene.

  She is both readier to respond
  to divine love, and also she is able to love better than other girls.

Rex soared happily, feeling the warmth of summer on his young wings
