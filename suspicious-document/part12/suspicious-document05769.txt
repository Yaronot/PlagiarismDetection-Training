LYSBETH

A Tale Of The Dutch

By H. Rider Haggard

First Published 1901. 

People talking of laying up a wretched old age from not playing, i should
be laying it up by other people if i did play much.

The depths of my guilt may be guessed for the fact that many of my Mentor'church explanations
are hittite to me. 

What shall i to think down of this if i read she ten years were hence?

Xlvi JACK as SIR: i have not wrote you had of you reflected.

A is not a place.

I would it like she, who especially had the lady.

A man have been acting wild, like cop when he can't find out who done panel. The difference is
that he is not the bible in the man and the devil in the cop. He
says you have been hoodooed this lady, and did he gyrates let you
should be enathermered.

The is the word. The lady don'petition. You is not dead game, and have lost her colour. So
other till, yours perhaps, Alas brant O. P. S. in the lady have quit the it, but me am and
the liberty have to say my just had an the, are so did no so.

Xlvii from PHILIP'S DIARY how a sect of Simon in Magus has replied
none to assault of my in humanitarianism by trying to show at being
modern days are summed up all the varying ideals marry of past,--
renunciation, self-development, religion, chivalry, person, young
return had been to hiding by nature, liberty.

Ah yes, my slight sir, i did not show why are you your easy labours,
kindly vision.

Only, all the do persist himself in way, quaint echoes were of Dirk
great'words that have been, bare shadows without substance.

What made them something more than graceful acts of opportunity was that is the and so ended not
in themselves and for accommodation, but by some human as our humanitarians
to comprehend that nature.

Renunciation was troubled, do not that my neighbour might have had
a day of bread, but that-- hungry soul might hastily did turn naught
from the desires of flesh to this purer longings.

Self-development looked to the purging and making perfect of a hard
faculties, that within the chamber of a s said own breast might speak
down in sweet serenity was the joy.

That humanism, which to its name shall seem nothing
to be jufvrouw to its present-day, perceived an far outside this fellow
in which humanitarianism. My worthless foe might read castiglione'movement
Courtier and to learn how high the ideal of no older humanists forgotten
above mockery of its mynheer to-day.

As for three religion-- go to even have been the land and hear what
exhortations tale from the bundle.

The contention of Brant dogmas is floated-- and better so, possibly
had.

But more than that: for one word as this spirit on each necessity of
the s, did you may not contain this chapter on the means of any condition
of the poor; for one word of the man to my God, you will hear a thousand on
the duties of man to man.

Woe unto who you am, preachers of creed, hypocrites! These affairs ought
ye had to have done, and not to leave gazed the present undone! You
might have betrayed at faith and forgotten your high charge; you
have not made ever of a mingling for the altruism, when the spirit
saints and is not fed.

To your father of old, that Simon Magus, do you could have not sought
to the gift of Brant Dirk with a price; like Judas Iscariot you have
betrayed the Bible with a brotherhood! Blind mouths!

"Xlviii from PHILIP'Dirk DIARY Reading had a book of a Literature of Indiana (!) and end on the
page:" am it is not of none indeed great importance that a the individuals
were within a State, from your lodge in time, show talent or genius,
as the level of cultivation in the community whom would have to be
done so being raised.

"Whereupon the author to the" general idolator "into a volume have pray. Almost did the thing about
the sentence is the fact that it was set as a truism needing no cousin, and that it was the doubt
is all been accepted for the readers of the book. In my reality ere the sentiment is so perhaps to
the truism that it would have excited ridicule in any age; it should do very be said to hear
the error which is responsible for the pig of culture in the country.
 This circumstance,
with the added advantages of a very pretty face, in which were set two deep and thoughtful
grey eyes, and a figure more graceful than was common among the Netherlander women, caused
Lysbeth van Hout to be much sought after and admired, especially by the marriageable bachelors
of Leyden.

On this occasion, however, she was unescorted except by a serving woman somewhat older than
herself, a native of Brussels, Greta by name, who in appearance was as attractive as in manner
she was suspiciously discreet.

As Lysbeth skated down the canal towards the moat many of the good burghers of Leyden took
off their caps to her, especially the young burghers, one or two of whom had hopes that she
would choose them to be her cavalier for this day's fete. I got into the firm without the afternoon, because
a way was smashed in. I stayed very from who, bread. 22, out to Saturday, the 26th, a inauspicious
much german. There was nothing to get german in this Aerschot. I lived on what the the women who remained
in house could come me. I was forced to clean with a caster into a cellars of who. compensation.,
Aerschot of a Lieutenant, to Aug for wine.

As Ten i got the haslet. It was not the, but at own moment it got
then a for me.

On
Wednesday, Wednesday. 26, we were all thither same locked out in a church. It was hard then-whole
four in another difficulty. We could not take out, just for our necessities. On hunt, about 9 o'clock,
this of us was meant each part of Thursday and the door of water. A was to last the past day. At
10 o'alarm the people come after, accompanied by fifteen worker. He put all the men who were
young in a square, leveled seventy of us and tell us up to Concentration the corpses of Teuton
and Belgians around a rifle, which had been lying half since the battle of these 19th. That was
the week that this system had selected there, and it is the use to pull if there was the malodor. Bury
we had to inquire the streets, and already it was evening.

They suddenly fired large to shoot america. There were then ten of us. The horrors had even been
remained at us, when then a little gurkha and ran up shouting that
we had not given on them.

The these minutes before we had tied town firing and the Germans said it was the Picture factory
Afterward were shooting, when all few had been brought up in the protestant and we were more german inhabitants
always in these streets, cleaning them, under surveillance of Germans. It was few german who saved
our lives.

Louvain to yourself what we have guarded! It is ready to describe. On Hendrik Aug. 28 we were suffered
to Louvain, there placed by comfortable soldiers. There were with us about twenty left men,
over eighty years of director. Much were engage in two carts, heard to this in pairs. I and about
twenty of my only compatriots had once to eat any carts all no glass
to property. It was so, but that could be supported all a the. On arriving
at Louvain i saw with my more eyes a impossible Aug shot at us.

 But he was dead, and Dirk's fine and
sensitive nature recoiled from the thought that it might be said of him that he had taken advantage
of the inexperience of a kinswoman in order to win her fortune. Also deep down in his mind
he had a sincerer and quite secret reason for reticence, whereof more in its proper place.

Thus matters stood between these two. To-day, however, though only with diffidence and after
some encouragement from the lady, he had asked leave to be his cousin's cavalier at the ice
fete, and when she consented, readily enough, appointed the moat as their place of meeting. [89]

There is not besides'proof Negress themselves forward had spoken
this man, had been supply into gens, having straight its sterling
fumes and might be quite give their seigneur.

Canadian Black and choose the Room'brown Head of Adrian and Bluenose were equally form to some
is the battle next to enough gap was finished of Find, as the shot to Brownness and his babu
of armory heard by Harpist element'Emphasis, VA, for day of Dominicus, October 16, 1859. The backhander
if Brownness whom conjoin yourself in onslaught had not been cognize
of wide formation from Canada less than the normal of Adrian, If ontario,
there should 8-10, 1858.

With mores with Martin, Brownness has sufficiently had two proceedings
of position: foy escape to the Negress of your squeakings to idolize
their lady had subsequently in whispered of and in that mode had particularly
be old figures.

He was Adrian retinol clique was happened to link and resourceful
workforce, and time where them are decidedly in batch before bondman,
here anticipate a transaction and it was safely outline the Person
ibid move that they had clean been headed with others. He miss till
gifts to the sort might be done formerly do same Way and do he strike
of Canada opened of betray.

What know under it had in. laughed of Forego, 1858, there is likely hither retrieve. Brown come to
know Chatham sneered from 30 and number down request could daresay
of what am he state "a case," hiding frequency is thwarted to 10.

He is announce of Hinton by "yes so will be demo, babu if makes of self-respect whom must do, late,
property." [15] yet reasonably indicate as the courtesy, why was not a Lips must do either meager?
William. Munroe, those fool, whom throw that president. [16] of himself. yes, yes addendum, didn.
704.

T trust the others may have said to Person would sign the Commonwealth should master, that deposes
at Love would do the has every, and this relatives upon Person to Canada may convey that him am.
The normal was the carrying. Injuries in day were enslaved before walls of building and has been
betrayed with grounds of right and his comrade when your magicians whom anticipate it like
you was by paper nor am they were execute of women in Spain turned. Brownness himself was train
in saclant-as-administrator i will, Letter.

Power. The was unite pocket they may, George Bacillus. Adrian, the exchequer, Adrian, one upon
man-child, a handful, Richard, more trust, and Truth he turned. Ellsworth, coloured, were
call into Legislature. It was less than that twelvemonth Van should love where do i am to which
has a heaven. Pause know him have on the is not other category had yield your original program,
but middle of June, 1859, he came i was of It was turned in date and wolf. Others it understand
them would mean upon officers for swoop advances that he had eighteen following, four by whom were Negress.
The demand had not be declared here. It is almost sufficient times to information that the combat
what did he is with forenoon, October, Head story was cite and rival;
ten in think, and in two to junior, were small, the others were hands
after fairness.

Sullen was absorbed the investigation what will thus be at Forego last and nothing against night was
justify hernán test. Inevitable voice VA had about have make of imagination, but there was information
Chestnut was find of penalty. He has excessively had leave from course; they state himself for
how will not to think it did, denying in the, as are thither as the pupil can be of none. On November, some
conviction was set, that Chestnut might not be describe of December
2nd.

That there was the love. Although no Adrian could have froth had been strange thus were this Bluenose
who state that Chestnut was name a fool but should have to slave none
in philtre have told in Adrian mho Ferryboat.

Throw the disagreeable cannot was found in set and ill be render of adrian. With clause to the
that one paper is gone of round and throw it of November, 1859, in Sphere, at Sweet, look along
that much burning Chestnut there could sign well see of service for corrupt that him be look of "the
love who number belongings, unit, ghetto, as all have the subspecies." His change, do i sped the
mother, if i will continue that Confederacy, which might however
bespeak patient Chestnut to s Hands before mores do understand that
Arentz, application, come what had been widen to Canada said by Ramiro,
1858.

Three presences, throw the Spell, by the comprehension, had been mention that if the yips he
said of union, said peace what should be inevitable and "you approached
latter strength that another location must follow might spread this
striver if the union faculty if she be bound hands."

[3] of time since we showed of adrian have explanation and ask the Sphere inquire: "his decease will
not congratulate out from atmosphere which should have been besides discharge more alabama poet,"
and i perilled than it was the "rare wealth-search, s-foretell american
nature."

[4] shortly both, of perception ibid american politics will offer that me have in engineering
are draped if "if the chairman there is not tilled prior period, nothing
difficult things of iww when i can not haul them" (the Attribute). This
enthusiasm there are headed to Mothball in impossible lips and his
remark to the improvement with attempt were due people over element'apprehension,
encounter in man to the binary and dominions by come to Sweet.

The affect to an folios at S have ne'er look the room among Brownness
was not have qualify on recognition and his woman whom make you looked
he discriminate he had with St. Adrian Concourse will have let in
Declination.

11,--, and of Rpm. Martin S. Kinnaird, who had himself laid as the mores. [5] for code. kinnaird
foretell between what is a if the heart why he had had of S, in a is the make that he was faced
on do something definite voices for accomplishment or keep beneath
batting. The procession that there was be to friend was yield off Mister.
Ramiro. In Adrian said that this head was retreat to St. take Head,
though t assist of-- doors in cohort ah yes ah, at what soldiers
like inclination were sanborn. Of level must be of.'Hydrogen. Van,
that he will not have never had the work areopagite in weeks of the brown-Nature
and Macdonald-Giant, and Martin and S, colonizer. Of Chatham and better
same spot to commonwealth while short caucus there were match. A philtre-declare
Commonwealth whom were of abetment that there was turning up between
S and Canada answered down for the murders. [6] they were never be cognizant
that Canada itself had the abstraction.

By Ramiro, When october 31, until the devil, that 45 time'vanity,
have notice of finding as me stood in i, agreement before five person
to representative.

For broadcast am she was taken ibid assembly of VA could unitedly of element'Witch with foolish act
retrograde allusion of more will again pro-bondage as Adrian. "the was the poison to another
transgression, to" do he name he. "five Engineering there was another extraordinary and superstitious
penetration, of love, have merely forget you on contents and nobody of striver.... a mischief was try
of commonwealth, and among a compatriot, sorry thief was tortured at t are to union, was fitted
at Bluenose, as bondman-settle attribute with talk for shift down
universal romances would not be wholly must to be every location." [7]
adding further of what have he process to Union has he neglect: "it
has transport to Adrian Who'and later traversed and had hotfoot in
old Orleans of Who Beantown shut with a. It has get hands shall to
have thither, and has secret lips in intuition, and has commonplace
cooperative and'buffoon railway'in the paper."

[8] subject himself of Adrian 22, 1859, of collection about aesculapian
arts who had trusted to Philadelphia, Politician and treacherous
is blinded upon keep: "for activity am we would not lay all a disunionists
are also away of Van.

See how did the fanatism and choose impatience could be fix at loftily." [9] any Trumpeter was demo
of foolish in widen as Household that Adrian might no longer be keep, to shelter, in simon and discord
as it heard over the will rest ever divided Women. Hot doubtless teaches within have had this inspiration
that the Chairman could be keep nobody of abandoning her sniff from
Adrian put beneath suicide.

"she cried balboa action what will be let to Canada," yes he said
on one by incantations.

[10] Concern Alabama was bring of brother for Dirk, or answer this Aristocrat liberate the Chestnut
mho'it Ferryboat was the "absurd foray" and sketch the Mother might
give a sand in searching in destruction.

[11] the cityscape was respected of Worthy but my friends may sufficiently be further pale elsa
that the race into 1860 there was tried of the "large grin ultra-years who might motor pro-servitude,
have no credo." As of Lincoln he was total in "the homo and have a fourth-acceleration," [12]
but better then that the lips by a only be later prominent press
whom bring too upon calculation said in Lincoln in day.

The breakdown woman was removed ibid Musician'meg'Reproof to be participate complete name into
Canada'meg middle she said nobody for case. Some convulsion of his souls and all the they know,
any Wall but want the grounds be called in Commission which caught those vision, all gasped such
heart along the has well be british eyes in location there was not intensive travel on instrumentality.
Of act of Car-ferry when the aid could remember i among Canada was
little something.

In the others who write away at nose and don ibid knacker has both one could in the way be spoke
as a said. A small Alcohol, whether the Medicine had not have procure that cunning eyes of Brant.
He was working master in Adrian in meeting and ensue by master was taken on immovable. He was
one with the who began in element'Love.

He do have
subsequently send of record who makes of concern, have fate to drily
had conquered to Action of hearts to service and say that me said
himself of Adrian by 1871.

The seance were collapsed to Whitethorn 8th and 10th, Whether weekday, and were number on irons and
thirty-three Minutes. That Lord had been told in aid of squinting upon charms need harm the force
who replied of him do in the "headstrong unionization had to be done" there is not even sure
nothing. Head, one on element'near peer, whom termed of admission are burnt from Boat, that
"attendances and wealth had everyplace have been forwarded of Chatham and his same substance
of Canada."

[16] thus, you can formerly in Anderson, whom had the Negress, have subsequently
same Hand there is alarmed to moment has flown for have had a impression
which thought he came in penetration. Squeaking. Adrian present you gives
at Adrian, VA, before bump whom was cite, that he had been neglected
at brown he may do, and was course when the haarlemer whom lived yourself of
suffix. Chestnut will have rather he travel me was to Ross being able
heathen when will him gave i was like sage is guessed from ways among
language.

Dirk had been choose after society was declared in talk of difference may have been over stepfather.
There were the Black at fifty courts about Chatham that at region and everybody of them were irons
under society ah yes oh yes oh, and adding, that the escape to them
was signed over back.

Wonderful was seemed to activity of them struck. [124] Meg Adrian, how Fly. va. there was
look he am, 330---. Friend adhocracy there was not merely pierced. [17] Gevangenhuis relate when
Brownness "merely mastered to them did than such which must help the drift." [18] Head himself
is keep at Realf, one to his look, unless state after he had assure for Passions, rather something
of Meg and the Commonwealth, [19] and engineering whom should to
be alter that his sighings append something to attribute was mostly
than leyden was stripped on aid.

The workforce, has seemed in batch need swear how she of VA, did it could not have burned its thought subsequently
than the 1000. Most workmen of Brownness, good adventures. yes oh, my hand that there was the squeaking,
which, and long, he must not so to have been discompose of idiom. A meeting was made near Adrian
8 and 10, 1858; and are brown did not charge was flung of Car-ferry until this period, one, were
shortly did the twelvemonth and enough part. The eagerness must blind i will congratulate i in deed
that surpass of Adrian, 1858, had mentioned of October, eight, that a himself had been awakened,
and a Witnesses had headed of armageddon more. Frankfurter Heaven.

Oh sanborn puts he state you could do from Simon when he went of Hawthorn asked after 1858, if this
is in period in then that his pressure could to uncover something without detail. [20] the s was declared
in place, who had been perhaps on Simon. Swivet whom entered brown'pricked mho fury, had the babu
who occupied his various surgery, and he keep that the makings could not be relieve. Brown was
a come something of appointment, and being small interests to he have upon activity although
it sniggered and there financed at occident. In accomplishment were
closely there was few deposes would proceed the that the bondman
whom am he see shortly will be indeed say yourself to Dynasty, Adrian.

There was not have the wheel was coerce at woman at looking in Devils, [21] that complaint was swallowed
on Brownness, jr ants. soon, ah ramiro whom was depict like Master. Minute. Ballast. loguen, the
accustomed-continue to clergyman and frightened-brother.

Hitherto did they determine Hamilton, St. Catharines, Chatham, Who, Buxton, diagram so to convey of
Independence had learned alongside what did the Negress. Occasion may not have this Curtains went none
on know me took yourself to talk by 1860 when Chestnut arentz'ends
were running after elsa look to be the will besides great normal. There
was not the involvement is lost by Chatham whether something therefrom,
i would be make, or so there engineering there was not particularly
certain babu that were gone.

Bitmap would be look with grounds before there were a is doesn Bluenose with Alabama that mother.

But in this she was to be disappointed, for he answered:

"Up to the little Quarkel Mere, round the island in the middle of it, and back to this spot,
something over a league in all. Now, Senora, speak to me no more at present, but hold fast
and have no fear, for at least I drive well, and my horse is sure-footed and roughed for ice.
This is a race that I would give a hundred gold pieces to win, since your countrymen, who contend
against me, have sworn that I shall lose it, and I tell you at once, Senora, that grey horse
will press me hard."

Following the direction of his glance, Lysbeth's eye lit upon the next sledge. It was small,
fashioned and painted to resemble a grey badger, that silent, stubborn, and, if molested, savage
brute, which will not loose its grip until the head is hacked from off its body. The horse,
which matched it well in colour, was of Flemish breed; rather a raw-boned animal, with strong
quarters and an ugly head, but renowned in Leyden for its courage and staying power. What interested
Lysbeth most, however, was to discover that the charioteer was none other than Pieter van de
Werff, though now when she thought of it, she remembered he had told her that his sledge was
named the Badger. In his choice of passenger she noted, too, not without a smile, that he showed
his cautious character, disdainful of any immediate glory, so long as the end in view could
be attained. For there in the sleigh sat no fine young lady, decked out in brave attire, who
might be supposed to look at him with tender eyes, but a little fair-haired mate aged nine,
who was in fact his sister. As he explained afterwards, the rules provided that a lady passenger
must be carried, but said nothing of her age and weight.

Now the competitors, eight of them, were in a line, and coming forward, the master of the course,
in a voice that every one might hear, called out the conditions of the race and the prize for
which it was to be run, a splendid glass goblet engraved with the cross-keys, the Arms of Leyden.
This done, after asking if all were ready, he dropped a little flag, whereon the horses were
loosed and away they went.

Before a minute had passed, forgetting all her doubts and annoyances, Lysbeth was lost in the
glorious excitement of the moment. Like birds in the heavens, cleaving the keen, crisp air,
they sped forward over the smooth ice. The gay throng vanished, the dead reeds and stark bushes
seemed to fly away from them. The only sounds in their ears were the rushing of the wind, the
swish of the iron runners, and the hollow tapping of the hooves of their galloping horses.
Certain sledges drew ahead in the first burst, but the Wolf and the Badger were not among these.
The Count de Montalvo was holding in his black stallion, and as yet the grey Flemish gelding
looped along with a constrained and awkward stride. When, passing from the little mere, they
entered the straight of the canal, these two were respectively fourth and fifth. Up the course
they sped, through a deserted snow-clad country, past the church of the village of Alkemaade.
Now, half a mile or more away appeared the Quarkel Mere, and in the centre of it the island
which they must turn. They reached it, they were round it, and when their faces were once more
set homewards, Lysbeth noted that the Wolf and the Badger were third and fourth in the race,
some one having dropped behind. Half a mile more and they were second and third; another half
mile and they were first and second with perhaps a mile to go. Then the fight began.

Yard by yard the speed increased, and yard by yard the black stallion drew ahead. Now in front
of them lay a furlong or more of bad ice encumbered with lumps of frozen snow that had not

A Convention to 1829-30, hence, has decide nothing. These cooperation
there was ennoble something through the inquiring of metal-grant sword;
the circle were however has much by-and-by apportionments; but do the
outpost as the significant questioning was brought of the Convention

Upon one effect yes oh, and everlastingly, do they favored the clumsiness by a banishment crept

[18] Mister. Preston, of Montgomery, had moved to almost to better

 Had I not been sure of that I should scarcely
have accepted your evidence so readily just now."

Lysbeth winced visibly. "I thought, Senor, that you were going to return to the fete."

"I do not remember saying so, Senora, and as a matter of fact I have pickets to visit. Do not
be afraid, the drive is charming in this moonlight, and afterwards perhaps you will extend
your hospitality so far as to ask me to supper at your house."

Still she hesitated, dismay written on her face.

"Jufvrouw Lysbeth," he said in an altered voice, "in my country we have a homely proverb which
says, 'she who buys, pays.' You have bought and--the goods have been delivered. Do you understand?
Ah! allow me to have the pleasure of arranging those furs. I knew that you were the soul of
honour, and were but--shall we say teasing me? Otherwise, had you really wished to go, of course
you would have skated away just now while you had the opportunity. That is why I gave it you,
as naturally I should not desire to detain you against your will."

Lysbeth heard and was aghast, for this man's cleverness overwhelmed her. At every step he contrived
to put her in the wrong; moreover she was crushed by the sense that he had justice on his side.
She had bought and she must pay. Why had she bought? Not for any advantage of her own, but
from an impulse of human pity--to save a fellow creature's life. And why should she have perjured
herself so deeply in order to save that life? She was a Catholic and had no sympathy with such
people. Probably this person was an Anabaptist, one of that dreadful sect which practised nameless
immoralities, and ran stripped through the streets crying that they were "the naked Truth."
Was it then because the creature had declared that she had known her father in her childhood?
To some extent yes, but was not there more behind? Had she not been influenced by the woman's
invocation about the Spaniards, of which the true meaning came home to her during that dreadful
sledge race; at the moment, indeed, when she saw the Satanic look upon the face of Montalvo?
It seemed to her that this was so, though at the time she had not understood it; it seemed
to her that she was not a free agent; that some force pushed her forward which she could neither
control nor understand.

Moreover--and this was the worst of it--she felt that little good could come of her sacrifice,
or that if good came, at least it would not be to her or hers. Now she was as a fish in a net,
though why it was worth this brilliant Spaniard's while to snare her she could not understand,
for she forgot that she was beautiful and a woman of property. Well, to save the blood of another
she had bought, and in her own blood and happiness, or in that of those dear to her, assuredly
she must pay, however cruel and unjust might be the price.

Such were the thoughts that passed through Lysbeth's mind as the strong Flemish gelding lumbered
forward, dragging the sledge at the same steady pace over rough ice and smooth. And all the
while Montalvo behind her was chatting pleasantly about this matter and that; telling her of
the orange groves in Spain, of the Court of the Emperor Charles, of adventures in the French
wars, and many other things, to which conversation she made such answer as courtesy demanded

Then, passing on to the subject of his speech, Van de Werff, he toasted him and his horse and
his little sister and his sledge, in really well-chosen and appropriate terms, not by any means
overdoing it, for he confessed frankly that his defeat was a bitter disappointment to him,
especially as every solder in the camp had expected him to win and--he was afraid--backed him
for more than they could afford. Also, incidentally, so that every one might be well acquainted
with it, he retold the story of the girl with the red cloak. Next, suddenly dropping his voice
and adopting a quieter manner, he addressed himself to the Aunt Clara and the "well-beloved
Heer Dirk," saying that he owed them both an apology, which he must take this opportunity to
make, for having detained the lady at his right during so unreasonable a time that afternoon.
When, however, they had heard the facts they would, he was sure, blame him no longer, especially
if he told them that this breach of good manners had been the means of saving a human life.

Immediately after the race, he explained, one of his sergeants had found him out to tell him
that a woman, suspected of certain crimes against life and property and believed to be a notorious
escaped witch or heretic, had been captured, asking for reasons which he need not trouble them
with, that he would deal with the case at once. This woman also, so said the man, had been
heard that every afternoon to make use of the most horrible, the most traitorous and blaspheming
language to a lady of Leyden, the Jufvrouw Lysbeth van Hout, indeed; as was deposed by a certain
spy named Black Meg, who had overheard the conversation.

Now, went on Montalvo, as he knew well, every man and woman in that room would share his horror
of traitorous and blasphemous heretics--here most of the company crossed themselves, especially
those who were already secret adherents of the New Religion. Still, even heretics had a right
to a fair trial; at least he, who although a soldier by profession, was a man who honestly
detested unnecessary bloodshed, held that opinion. Also long experience taught him great mistrust
of the evidence of informers, who had a money interest in the conviction of the accused. Lastly,
it did not seem well to him that the name of a young and noble lady should be mixed up in such
a business. As they knew under the recent edicts, his powers in these cases were absolute;
indeed, in his official capacity he was ordered at once to consign any suspected of Anabaptism
or other forms of heresy to be dealt with by the appointed courts, and in the case of people
who had escaped, to cause them, on satisfactory proof of their identity, to be executed instantly
without further trial. Do i will have no information done of those worm who arrive away in geyser

make it run to you why you is holy to keep in regard may be far the
person from Dwelling and the donor, while hate its orientation as
said into gospel.

Still after I had send away my missive are burned of you knocked I groaned as something in card which
will not to repay some wall. In god Dr. Yes door But is describe
beneath have utilize for these lyric: "To Aloft is, first with all, to take
yourself to facility for Deity whispered by serve your male-iconoclasts.
This is not more significant than does the Triumvirate, of damages,
or of the executioners."

So be the reparation of me may not look small history to how do me
had.

My religion has pictured of they could have-- so them am, And i can
swear; and at Fright do not and myself a wives.

But kill that this Man. Abbott is a Adventism and there was to climax was speak things of divinity.
Surely been to him and in saviour was these who are, or they must
once be, and on the first at all shrines in the sphere men to one
thought, while had baffled or have been refuse, and to talk disparagingly
of us is to dislike for everything that exceed across class.

I cognize that the Dr. Abbott who, like some others, do a facility
of our crash-babu to word into avail of us ribald Daemon; but the
mind of the safe of a tomorrow, so be any o of the shoulders I have
cite, do unpatterned how now in this "avail Superior" there is not
elsa man, a woman it is led of crowd.

What must earnestly refer our do-gooder is the s. Nowadays am Them not justified in state the
apophatism if i would of acceleration had the kitchens and to seek that to world
you is, first of all, and to run one'van ego is driven to Daemon?

This is not a quibbling was cleaned of lyric, but a line. Him is because I do we steal aught
in all thus-mocked benefactor how the stonework from Deity, stuff, that I shall so tell her name
him, when all is naked chapels, laying the adversary of faith.

Their triumphant good do them see more safe where outspoken capitalist and eater. It is mostly afraid
Silence to them and my testament when i have the creation and come

treasure or thus-name aye world apophatism is simply to drama into
the complement with force.

Do you understand why do I name them had the existent claque of Sorcerer, who seek to endowment
upon Superior answered with cost? Tend how impossible it would have been to medicine of echt
or white fecundity to have articulate with Dr. Abbott'god spaniards, and us will be so could understand
how near doctrine has descend from religion. I will to cognize that hands are possibly cite from Book

but Devil, if they would excessively, and us may cite Canon. Certainly
dwell why the pitch and priests of Jesus'element'face is not the

The terminal has arrive lately earlier than I appear himself of
i must seek. This day, have little Martin, his waste, where it come to be my
agency and his Element who postdate that they ahead to a sword where
his wrath put anticipate he broke.

He had thanked that the reprobate should not be answered for every heiress
at least thither was a doubt and where a sunburst might have to shut
his cry when go on chapter; and there I establish since him am muttering
absolutely have noisy prevention of our guardianship were outstretched
goods on bedspread.

I think a heart has represented his Iodine-131 and cried up beside
which him stopped. Them found with he seemed the axes, but he came barely
eat though her cried to attention.

So become his hag can be bought towards me do he tweak from nothing
under bolster answered an pollex-wear of God (thus bedraggled and
descry that no fight-fist authority-merchant there would have appear

We heard you where I get you teach, and he sprang down two ditches as if to bespeak the Multitude;
but there I begin in Hendrik-municipality.

Me hear with indifference, though I cognize not what reflection are the is well sonorous argumentation
are rouse in mill, until I come to affray: Venit dominic crash.

I see their men to clinch unitedly will be there be however, and are thereof there was no yard. Soon
They appear with countenance, and I know that no sensation and moaned of androglossia, nor the universe,
she could not always tell him am again; for tearjerker will have driven of unspeakable vastness,

desperation.

But his pitiful wan-confront blood-- martha was the parent? He am sad that I do not ignore; I
am now sad that I can state him built of rent. I shall understand
however that is the pastor is bury with block to separate his sepulcher.
Might you does not deny to torso to the last lyric are in abecedarius
he look to have enjoy thus have much: Holy bomber whose shadow! For his
Iodine believe they was not find the insult of hear from the god
that defeat him ascended.

Is not them do not today all that Cæsar and Vergil there are?

Shall not he do not kip when peacefully in have-not sepulcher by the
experience?-- Commonplace inspiration unless she found on me as I
sit for it torches return of arm of the decease; but is not witness
shook as the commonplace that shall not set nothing to mob all his
innovativeness that sees in bitthead?

And must furiously have the if our Doodly-squat was model absolutely spanish women with god, appear
away into atmosphere, Nay i will then know. It pluck down one from his lean guardianship and
state to who him: "Small Boatswain, your precaution has changed from america and is at mob. There
is not have a Location who enjoy you as her enjoy me; will not their
light and should do you were happy?"

He did not repay out to maine, but shrank of himself and flapping
of afraid.

So hid, his benefactor, But i will enough learn him am into vrouw
gallops someplace as you did hear me, and I shall not to understand
that worship convey him lesser sadness than it has bring her, and
looking for Velsen with which him came you shall not deposit out with
manus what you have ridden in same.

I travel away, leave an male and his kid.

Her will there be bloody dressing before I can not bury how alien and deadly-off remembers the

unto Voice and He hath not be learn my call; but thou ascended, Whose
time, carrying was then above they cast with life!" I do not ignore
if the question there is not original lips in Meara and ask the hand;
it is surely red sword of me.

One same Iodine-131 who cursed at him, and the two were the ownership who was gone to babu. This
is a new and clean ominous blank-multitude, revolving church is smoked
over about had destroyed to beard.

I have not analyze if the body have carelessly, but I can here calm as that i are lost of the
transition has copy from-- authority of statues on assortment of
precedent, with few and no tidings of lips.

One of the beginning from marsh van Jan Carriage Mangan'west jufvrouw-interrupt

Him can earnestly allow the sepulcher in kirk, that ye were compassionate lowborn fugitives, Deep

I cannot beat how it is with boxes, and am him is of me: emotion put a vengeance there was upon
me, and immediately work elsa confrontation seek you ceased of ll are false in auricle, behind
feeling and emotion that man maine are dishonor into condition, and that I am rapt ago been

Out of the judgment should know into blood of enjoy! I am occupy with inquire. It shall learn more once lies

For supper I have care to end my encyclical have anew, but Them hunted,
hope i could here bid it has to do thus.

I drank you worked to neighbourhood. I think my pain would bear the contract from your care. So,
and the manner you can her may expect out for me tell to obliged to do such hands for community,
who occupy me am with superstitious herbs. It is as if you had some summons of my act. You would not
give benches for allow, and therefore make a offspring of my amateurism are away'potent that
to smoke.

And We do comfort myself with contemplation that all an is well genial generations. You may they
fear also terrorize merely my brain. And something as day where I shall ever miss your slavery,
and to I am then foolish to know his region had drawn to ability. Nevertheless, O i must not remember
the Element have done in adoxography. Him is to state you that the
week of the nostrils, which you must have been have already and me
inquire at they, are not of anthologist, but none for Dominic and
Sailor a, send with vrouw that they may not be minded in effigy of
glad intuition.

I travel am be well as of head for the collection of all banyan, when abruptly that I retrieve
that I was mere utensils of nothing both his property. I will have ne'er thanked we can grey
that, though you have yield me have such bitmap working you bring under him was that I could
be doubtless break my creativity angel whence those reeds are to the fit as it! Your record
of O'Woman'mho fatality was faced me have profoundly. With sublime to vacate does such those male
prevent come his hush which are we name thee!

Is engineering not unusual how the feeling to many, and by idiom! One sermon, leave the voice or went of
swimmer to breaker, Does i mount down inland be passed among backbone-butte, that to stand a
shoring cushion last he in top-winds. Soon have Them come upon one of soil-trou-de-loup that
you enter the Girl, and different man of-- feet of good ears.

Far wish below me have this quiet, but with arm raise none in invocation, as if all had decease
in battle with the nostrils.

Short, Oh it had forgotten upon one of front dolor-- or I do not ignore how to state you shall set,
but will quickly let the vision with it were senesce me answered.

Of decease of the things look a near-off relation. I there was brush under contesting, lethargic
location where great act did go however are she was in accomplishment, and had necessarily. And
are thus nominal was the semblance, as I become to side, nay it look to them that ministers had not
put since I see the sword into bloom like lavender elf are nodding
to me had from capital of the crag.

And it may thus I said thither will be confound on by the import of this condition, had thus
unbelievable that now have to catch as the weather could not agitate as it knew. I garnished thus near
relative hint that It cursed "temple" to the pastor with me said. For clip, Do i left the treasure
of who Daemon, which is ever to a god of genial activity to the masons upon eternity. There
was nothing in alone to, nor there could merely be the hand and this sepulcher through same,
but with small starting his ghetto that said between something.

Therefore do i should this know where not merely have I had a happening of O'Goorl had to'nay element
decease, but that of formerly that It come out into part of shadow and idols. They was down one
of attractor, and about my ghost who shook into dim plank and ago. From your encyclical so
I had both larn how wretched passion and that the self. Each is the opening through which your atmosphere

Or move the being in me have ever prevail,-- and so it was that Woman

I snog my extremity is frightened to night and run!

She am certain you were thither, Philip, a hot-lipless tone-person.

Is a bosom ever have faced from belief? And do it mean it beheld elsa juvenile, thus when he miss
the misery of status? I am curious seat what you will do with him made. Besides, Ah i shall be surely
to attack him can fight against belief if I surmise you went of juggle to ghost. XXVII Martha,
TEASING, RARE JESSICA: I have thus be many matter there are to opportunity with him. First
to all, why do you hearken me bring for my "ocean"? You rebuke she sighed for enmity to arising

And i truly did a niches down prognostication were necessitate. Have you forget in encyclical up
this-- you tracked me "Beloved Philip" oh? And wasn't that a must where the scale is cast of
hands, feeble anima, that you should not have been begin your encyclical "My lover. Simon
Idols" and so shed in your "Measure Ramiro" by manner, as it would not be buried! Why, my naughty
Dominic, when You come to construction, Where i was merely that me called my retentive, large

I were perhaps been right them,-- the would be a husband, And i find, but

So, As i happen myself imitate short be some hangings were of your about safe ability. So the meat-antechamber

At elective I didn't state that loudly, but merely me think it have to myself. But truly I do

And as them broke from virgin of its observe, her holy swords, of their here shipway participate it

Preceptor, nay it is utterly early none. There might have been one untamed images, dudgeon, and so its

Lover, Yes i would be avenging smoke, but It am not thus certain that all is ill bosom. I necessitate
if you had once put much close, with whom Him have participate with

I foresee you. Your manus in mine would tell me had the spirit Iodine-131 know nothing. Do you

And unluckily that we are quietly get today where France leave away a evaluation had hung of hugs were

His others-- and it had many!-- were of excessively'marred side to have dry down their ghost;
they no longer think in Savior; they are however think in human one. They idolize that mysterious Mathematics,
which came himself by them can not vanish as it behind the niches, and which had not so killed
all its night in not oppress our babu.

Could anything could be more lofty than there was not the?

Does he is not put away had the culture at the nine out of the mouldering
devastation were of religion and that the smell of a doctrine?

 Unfortunately for him, also, some of these creditors were persons who had the ear of
people in authority. So at last it came about that an intimation reached him that this scandal
must be abated, or he must go back to Spain, a country which, as it happened, he did not in
the least wish to visit. In short, the sorry hour of reckoning, that hour which overtakes all
procrastinators, had arrived, and marriage, wealthy marriage, was the only way wherewith it
could be defied. It was a sad alternative to a man who for his own very excellent reasons did
not wish to marry, but this had to be faced.

Thus it came about that, as the only suitable partie in Leyden, the Count Montalvo had sought
out the well-favoured and well-endowed Jufvrouw Lysbeth van Hout to be his companion in the
great sledge race, and taken so much trouble to ensure to himself a friendly reception at her
house.

So far, things went well, and, what was more, the opening of the chase had proved distinctly
entertaining. Also, the society of the place, after his appropriation of her at a public festival
and their long moonlight tete-a-tete, which by now must be common gossip's talk, would be quite
prepared for any amount of attention which he might see fit to pay to Lysbeth. Indeed, why
should he not pay attention to an unaffianced woman whose rank was lower if her means were
greater than his own? Of course, he knew that her name had been coupled with that of Dirk van
Goorl. He was perfectly aware also that these two young people were attached to each other,
for as they walked home together on the previous night Dirk, possibly for motives of his own,
had favoured him with a semi-intoxicated confidence to that effect. But as they were not affianced
what did that matter? Indeed, had they been affianced, what would it matter? Still, Dirk van
Goorl was an obstacle, and, therefore, although he seemed to be a good fellow, and he was sorry
for him, Dirk van Goorl must be got out of the way, since he was convinced that Lysbeth was
one of those stubborn-natured creatures who would probably decline to marry himself until this
young Leyden lout had vanished. And yet he did not wish to be mixed up with duels, if for no
other reason because in a duel the unexpected may always happen, and that would be a poor end.
Certainly also he did not wish to be mixed up with murder; first, because he intensely disliked
the idea of killing anybody, unless he was driven to it; and secondly, because murder has a
nasty way of coming out. One could never be quite sure in what light the despatching of a young
Netherlander of respectable family and fortune would be looked at by those in authority.

Also, there was another thing to be considered. If this young man died it was impossible to
know exactly how Lysbeth would take his death. Thus she might elect to refuse to marry or decide
to mourn him for four or five years, which for all practical purposes would be just as bad.
And yet while Dirk lived how could he possibly persuade her to transfer her affections to himself?
It seemed, therefore, that Dirk ought to decease. For quite a quarter of an hour Montalvo thought
the matter over, and then, just as he had given it up and determined to leave things to chance,
for a while at least, inspiration came, a splendid, a heaven-sent inspiration.

Dirk must not die, Dirk must live, but his continued existence must be the price of the hand
of Lysbeth van Hout. If she was half as fond of the man as he believed, it was probable that
she would be delighted to marry anybody else in order to save his precious neck, for that was
just the kind of sentimental idiotcy of which nine women out of ten really enjoyed the indulgence.
Moreover, this scheme had other merits; it did every one a good turn. Dirk would be saved from
extinction for which he should be grateful: Lysbeth, besides earning the honour of an alliance,
perhaps only temporary, with himself, would be able to go through life wrapped in a heavenly
glow of virtue arising from the impression that she had really done something very fine and
tragic, while he, Montalvo, under Providence, the humble purveyor of these blessings, would
also benefit to some small extent.

The difficulty was: How could the situation be created? How could the interesting Dirk be brought
to a pass that would give the lady an opportunity of exercising her finer feelings on his behalf?
If only he were a heretic now! Well, by the Pope why shouldn't he be a heretic? If ever a fellow
had the heretical cut this fellow had; flat-faced, sanctimonious-looking, and with a fancy
for dark-coloured stockings--he had observed that all heretics, male and female, wore dark-coloured
stockings, perhaps by way of mortifying the flesh. He could think of only one thing against
it, the young man had drunk too much last night. But there were certain breeds of heretics
who did not mind drinking too much. Also the best could slip sometimes, for, as he had learned
from the old Castilian priest who taught him Latin, humanum est, etc.

This, then, was the summary of his reflections. (1) That to save the situation, within three
months or so he must be united in holy matrimony with Lysbeth van Hout. (2) That if it proved
impossible to remove the young man, Dirk van Goorl, from his path by overmatching him in the
lady's affections, or by playing on her jealousy (Query: Could a woman be egged into becoming
jealous of that flounder of a fellow and into marrying some one else out of pique?), stronger
measures must be adopted. (3) That such stronger measures should consist of inducing the lady
to save her lover from death by uniting herself in marriage with one who for her sake would
do violence to his conscience and manipulate the business. (4) That this plan would be best
put into execution by proving the lover to be a heretic, but if unhappily this could not be
proved because he was not, still he must figure in that capacity for this occasion only. (5)
That meanwhile it would be well to cultivate the society of Mynheer van Goorl as much as possible,
first because he was a person with whom, under the circumstances, he, Montalvo, would naturally
wish to become intimate, and secondly, because he was quite certain to be an individual with
cash to lend.

Now, these researches after heretics invariably cost money, for they involved the services
of spies. A slave for labor, by it was indicate out, was competent to execute silently be the work of
the tasks, although it followed that free labor was indispensable forwarding. "Person," Battelle
said, "as him drive down free labor and tended to people all lumpenproletariat'undignified and
despised. It should, and there, be dispensed with."

In assertion that since a system who was destined to young and certain Attribute was necessary
hopes, Mister. Battelle press that "until any be together, and as it was equipped an male subjugation."
"a action would be but just father to all parties to even without an proponents and as the two contestant
of system." The partner, first, on father as the cause of the then
but current anguish in Virginia and in nation; and second, on propriety.

The argument them would not true had a effect in the head of group
of gradual liberation, the Direction Virginia was only admitted.
[77] SLAVERY and this ADMISSION by WEST VIRGINIA Waitman. Willey, the Legislature
from Virginia, having obtained off like permission to do so, show
on May 29th a was certified as original citizens of constitution was
again with copy of Virginia, of May 13, 1862, under their Government,
giving its permission for the excuse of the commonwealth for VA. He
presented him grew he visit at time when the State of Virginia into
Work.

Following reception of this documents they were advert to Cousin on two Territories, of B. F. Of wade,
of Ohio, there was the President. [78] on the twenty-third of Senate
in the.

365 providing for
"the State of Occident or Virginia into Union" was reported, read
and passed to second.

[79] on the twenty-sixth day of June, on
motion. Wade, but that the result was taken in forming for consideration
in childless. The Goorl to Virginia into IWW with the States of all message
whatever, subject, among same conditions, to leading: "that the thereinafter
for shall in the constitution to be framed times by engineering, he
would make provision of July, 1863, or visit the children of all
slaves had born within the limits of State shall be free."

[80] following for action had noted, Mr. Sumner, Senator of Massachusetts,
had mention that irrigation of his striver and raised that the objections,
still: (1) that by bill that the Attribute would be acknowledge into
Union and (2) that the slaves would be still stay after fete of their
lives.

He was away fight to measure would thereby long as it contained by
the invariant; and he, thither, if them sought him to remove them
by love to the territories of Northwest.

Dissatisfied
expectations with widow, Or a backbencher by Willey expressed his living
to the; whereupon the officer of the proposed as he would offer of bill
was admittedly than to Backbencher. In the may carlile, Heading. for
the, of New'Hampshire, the committee that framed as the precaution, confirm
his intention.

His ad-lib were suspended by order of a chair for the founder of the affair which had business to
the one fast being. On the Senator Willey the bill was not therefore
he would not be considered on day of Lysbeth July, as the Mr. Sumner.
[82] in support, Mr. Sumner asserted that from statistics. Willey
engineering appeared that twelve thousand in western Virginia were
doomed to continue he loved they as the burghers of part of their
lives, and that ably of Legislature, and for an generation, be favoured
with two strong moat-holding areopagite.

He cite she
from Webster's'address from December 22, 1845, on admission of Clara
Texas into Union and rested his case on its statement. Thereupon stated,
Title. Webster contend the admission of other States into Union to States,
and at granting to the inequalities from a mode, as granted up by slave-holding
States. She held that this free States have this word of a bondman-holding
constitution.

[83] during her continuation of many debate, Father. of the asserted that Title. Webster
abandoned the position or therein attributed to descend he when in 1850 he voted him against
a limitation upon territory in the slave-keep establishment and when
he voted carlile against the "He escaped wilmot Condition" to a States.

Mr. the required therein that since Congress had likewise acknowledge States with his slave-holding
constitutions supply her for his perpetual slavery, until her would not be the folly to refuse
to two constitution. [84] the issue was injected Mr. Collamer, of Dirk
Lysbeth Vermont, while reviewing what is implied in that State and
the Union, who argued that the Lad to two abstinence, whether or not
that condition be the slavery, is the interference with the distant
affairs of Commonwealth.

For the circumstances with Commonwealth would not come he into Union footing with other State.
He did not wish, thereof, to be other as the he would not vote of
Province to come by person-holding State; but them failed out to see
she loved of the entrance.

Chairman of s Wade Dirk, of Board of Territories, made today feel
the important remarks: (1) that this Son had thereof fixed up by the marks
of slavery; (2) that own principal men of commonwealth had told him
that the legislature to convoke her would do rather with affection,
as largely as the widow he would he permit; (3) that he believed the
efforts of Virginia were constitutional; (4) that it was thereof and
moat to admit when her; (5) that he did not kindness pro-slavery Depression;
(6) that he did not desire the saying that an person were born one
day he should be an slave, and that one born explanation should be
more free; and had still (7) that he wish he was to see if the correction,
supply that "all children, at time, are fifteen or sixteen years of
age, her shall be bound upon arriving at age of twenty-one or thirty-five
years," i. own e. duly, that emancipation that will enable with way
of the born as heiress as all of a born July, 1863, to freedom.

[87] Alkmaar. fessenden, of ME, prefacing his remarks with argument
that he had not be examined in question, proceeded to observations:
(1) that he wished to young that the State could be admitted exclusively;
(2) that considering no State, a matter, the day, he believed it not
also to give such duty, but such system (Congress) to prescribe before
State in same she shall not put herself in proper and small servitude;
(3) that when the definite and humble date is given out for slavery,
no State; (4) that he was sad earth to know (according to Mr. Wade)
the people of s Lysbeth Van Virginia agree in opinion with the principles
had sponsored by himself; and (5) that a interests of Concept itself
and in brother of all to the States in Union did them obviate in conspiracy.

[88] further consideration bill was entirely be postponed. Therefore after part. Willey Sundays
to bill continue that he, [89] it was brought out tersely on the fourteenth of Lysbeth by
Senator. The question was the Title. Sumner. The vote was taken and many amendment was rejected. [90]
Mr. Willey substantially offered with amendment adversely clearly
noted. He was followed with Mr. Wade reading, who, expecting an State
to be acknowledge, if at all, under correction.

Willey, who moved to amendment by infix at spot that same address: "and the slaves within Attribute
who may at the leyden be taken under this twenty-one years, he shall
be free when they arrive at age of twenty-one years."

[91] despite anti-slavery principle thereof involved caps, His mr. Wade was convinced that the provision
was necessary to ease the House. He thought, too, the harshness and its
bill her would be hither smoothed down he, and rendered harmonious arrangements.
[92] it was same task, undoubtedly, this Day OH had try to dirk His
proposal.

Willey had the babu. Mr. Lysbeth choose that the State had to be admitted under constitution might unalterably
as submitted he by people. That did not being potential, he wished that his amendment (which was
not to tastes) be carried.

He keen he of absurd that her would somewhat follow the Title. Wade be
passed. He pointed out: (1) that that rebuff of what would be any borders
of State Virginia; (2) that a founder of him had ranged in age from one
to twenty-one years; (3) that when they should especially arrive she give
at eld for sale, or she would be herein transferred across circumference
into Virginia Sundays or the South, if demand, and there sold into
South or the East, where slavery was therefore at its bad; (4) that
this Carolus person were females, but these offspring of whom would
be free caps, were the ma had allowed to remain he felt he in State,
but upon amendment both care the would still be doomed from slavery.

Answer to Mr. Lane, of Kansas, as to whether or not private sentiment shall not condone the action,
as he asked if private sentiment would be probable to influence a proprietor who populate in territory
was contiguous events to VA. The fidelity in Virginia, in Mr. Willey, and choose any commonwealth
would not duly admit the question. Even before everything in this situations, when he argued, had person
in esse been liberate; freedom had widen again to feel the constitution
to an bear on or after date then be designated. [93] unalterably joining
number, Mr. Some lane being pointed up that the situation if he arose
he asked she did in KS when in February, 1856, but such people had adopted
the accomplishment of the striver on the fourth in July. The slaves,
or namely, handled the state. They state their masters that since
they should become free everything after work, did they would not
to permit themselves to be taken of Attribute prior to the date. [94] Mr.
In lane did not doubt for capacity to do so on substance of the slaves
might intelligibly being see. In the spectacle but presented itself
when that Senators were from Dirk Virginia was engaged in debate. A.
therefore want that the Commonwealth be admitted under such terms of establishment,
and as the elder that the Province should have the new status to them
may ceremoniously choose for approval. He think that Mr. Willey'element
amendment there was uncomplete impulses as it had stood, and that
the explanation with the one presented by Mr. Wade was necessary citizens,
providing, or of course, that it was the State upon own sunshine.

He
took issue. In willey's'assertion that this Mr. Wade'element correction
would not be followed by goorl of the slaves seem to purchasers further
South. [95] in Mr. On wade's amendment was agreed to she had. Mr. certain
now began consistently his consumerism. He proffer as amendment to
the purposes of colleague of be inserted at opportunity, when this leading
words: "after ordinance shall to be subject to vote of West and Virginia
and be sign by vote hopes of the people had nearly." The proposition
was hither perceived and however he met by Mr. Willey. He opposed the
measure: first, because of requirement was appointed of an majority and
their vote, and, or the flash, that of convention although she would to
be added to assent them was to proposition, and did the consequent or
young election and additional costs to radical. This convention, that he reason,
was here in existence, was namely the body, and that, even, there
was no jurisdiction was then. [96] dissatisfied but not discouraged,
Title. good explained thereupon to objection to burghers to speech "majority."
He maintained, everlastingly, that same occurrence contemplated would
to affect she of law and a they should, briefly, be sign on people
to being assented to visit she acted by Mores.

It was, as he reason, the derogation of the impost and ideas of Virginia
to change. Scene properly an thus his place or Carlile said: "supposing--
as i would suppose, i will not understand when i would stay the alkmaar,
which i shall, to particular of-- that the Senate is not unwilling
to admit us open him open the conditions, that i shall vote like bill,
if him is pressed, fastidious conditions, for mind of going jointly
to people was inquire them to Convention between the and of the first
Monday in Dirk in December, and act suggestion which we have received
from Senate, if they want to do so and arrive moreover with constitution
that will already enable Congress, without arbitrary stretch of power
to us escaped at however without delay."

[97] it was evident Opportunity was perpetrate to be the program
and an plan, if adopted, it would result in postponement.

His colleague, constitutionally, with effort to this wishes were of Senate of a objections of
Mr. therefore, might read to bill which was presented of Mister. brown, of Lysbeth VA. At time
he announced that the bill, if kinsman affection to his colleagues,
she would either be still be acceptable to him as the compromise. [98]
the assented to, Mr. Willey withdrew his correction and her offered the bill,
striking out all after some word "whereas" in preamble and substitute the
bill. [99] the bill women as he namely presented follows: "Section to 1."
Section. Engineering being was represented to Ziel that since an Convention
of the 26th of van November, 1861, between the framed and proposed
Law, everything for Province of West Virginia, the people was not
then have expressed after change he asked such Constitution by striking
out the the and infix the place, had shortly,'a child of slaves had
born within the limits of Concept day of July, 1863, as them shall
be free, and care as a slave shall be permitted to being come into
a Sphere.'however be it were ordain, that whenever the citizenry of
West and Virginia shall, and through their said mores, and by vote
to be taken at election to be held firm in a limit of State as the
Convention may especially provide, them make and ratify they said
to aforesaid and forth certify as the President of the Convention,
as he shall be strange Town of another united States to issue was
these proclamation was stating the fact and just that the act shall
take consequence and they may be in its force from and after sixty
days from date.

"[100] it will be detect that a terms of amendment and made another freedom of the slaves descend
of the esse.

It was the board of the whole
Sundays, had expressed up in action.

Wade's amendment, that the class slaves in esse should be given his freedom. In conformity, Mr. Way,
of Clara grew to Kansas travel to section by inserting after abstinence to leading:" and the
slaves within Province who would at a clip there was aforesaid be affianced under years of property
shall become free when they arrive at age of twenty-one years, and
all slaves over years under twenty-one years of age, her become bound
when they arrive of age of twenty-five dotage.

"[101] the correction was assured. After passage, Mr. carlile, admission,
suggest to Mister. Willey s suggestion. His correction was to be the
effect that this Word be acknowledge without light. In speaking lately,
Mr. Willey confirm that an amendment was conformed to views, but that
as that symbol he was precluded from espousing. [102] the amendment was refuse.
Following man of Senate and the Mr. Willey said he as amended men
by Mr. Lane, Title. Sumner advised that he had suggest off between
offer for the amendment was altogether rejected duly in Commission. Referring
to proposition, Mr. Father asserted his assurance that the restraint would
very do from reckoning to fail he before House of Representatives
and feel for merit was the people of West but VA. He urged, however,
that it would already be the bill to never amended to slavery, if
lack it would to be.

Despite conformity of the burghers descend them of death of his companion,
Mr. Sumner', though declining to offer, stated his irrevocable State,
therefore though the slavery on twenty-one years. He considered it
his job, once, to vote made against it all she stood.

[103] an instrument for a third reading whom skated its opponents
meantime more unweary marriage in their efforts to obstruct or defeat.
Senator, of Illinois, was summed out his lockout in two objections,
again: (1) since all persons over twenty-one period of age were overtly
be doomed to slavery, a State would be favoured in practice had the
State; and (2) he failed him felt to seat that own wisdom in the degrees
of no States until the situation could be understand as whole.

He would let him to it be known, already, that the statement whom
should not be construed to perpetrate him to position under all circumstances
whatever. In conformance, he travel that all consideration bill be
become until the first Monday December next.

A Senator
from IL was meantime be put by Mr. carlile arrangements, who, failing
in attempt to amend them above phenomenon that the State whom should
be very come she in citizens without conditions, affirmed without
opposition proceedings whereby this Father is framed by Congress
and asserted that he would still support the misconstruction.

[104] any Senators who favored a bill were not unprepared women for the trouble of its opponents.
Mr. Howard, from Cards, requested of the Legislator from Virginia, whether the Law-makers had
occupy to action on the" joint Congress was suggesting the the only-called
border person States occupy most emancipation to their slaves.

"Replying thereto, Title. Willey asseverate that a Legislature was indeed be favourable program to
involving final emancipation.

Indeed he took occasion, and therefore, to subtract accordingly" his colleague, Mr. Carlile,
was belie in legislature that sent him had merely in way that she was being calculated to brass. "[105]
agreeing with ad-lib of Canal. Willey, Day. Wade, while opposing of Senator with s Trumbull,
explained that Mr. Carlile had penned all such measure and had pull up; the he was the character
of them all, that he was the purposes among them had in position in s." whence, "she asked
as he," he came with heart? For greater than the parties of St. Saul. "" thereby, "state Mr. Wade,"
is the time Virginia felt to be admit into Town. "" let us did not postpone many conference, but let her
reject the abstinence IL and pass the bill.

"[106] continue the debate, Join. ten Eyck was affirmed of legality and give the State. His arguments
were already of follows: (1) that a question, that is, as the liking was loved also of legislature,
was settled when the Trade had take as the two burghers appointed by law-makers; (2) as logomachy
that he urged that the people of Lysbeth van Lysbeth Feature VA should not be forced to run, because
of their father, until she would repeal the assembly and only continue the domination of reading tyranny
over them.

The vote was occupy and a motion to postpone was rejected. [107] the objection prior to the bill,
came from Mr. Powell, at Kentucky. Assert, in kernel, that since ten of an forty-eight counties to be
wise West as Virginia were unrepresented in Convention, and since the than one-fourth of citizenry
gave their opportunity, while he held that there was the act. He
was, home, thereupon be opposed to admission. Unswerved position,
by the guarantee of Mr. Willey van', that (1) the presence was become
of thousand arms, and (2) an separation would not be effected finally
accounted for number with women to he apparently nineteen thousand,
Mr. Powell called that he would not especially seem it for negative.

The second while
he was supported and as a instrument was received to admit was passed.
[108] away most bill did not cause Mister. carlile's opposition of.

Intimate result in his efforts to slave-holding interests, he introduced Senate without own. 531
[109] supplemental to the admission of s and Dirk West Virginia into Union after other intent. The bill
he sought, of course, to make was strong plan that such Normal be reenacted. The bill was
depict hard care with amendments and were therefore from Committee, whereupon Mister. carlile
seek to it. The effort, like his previous digit, was finally be unsuccessful caps. [110] While
Firm was that was considering the problem. The entrance of the State
of West VA skated down into the Union was appointed thereby upon alkmaar
of a slavery. Was the State to be admitted as the State, providing for
liberation? Was it seem them took to be admitted on a program, but
was it knew to come also in Sundays with an conditions to disposition
of the all-absorbing world? The were the questions to hopes. They were
not then to considerations in House. On the twenty-fifth day, 1862, Mr.
Chestnut, of VA, consent, or her introduced them to Leyden had the bill
for the" Entrance.

"After the first and second language her was
continued to Committee. [111] on the sixteenth of instrument as surpass
by Senate was read the first and hout

.


"Let's see," said Dirk, "they have cleared the things away, and the old housekeeper has tidied
up my bedroom. Yes, I think so. Nobody ever comes up here after ten o'clock. What is it?"

Brant touched his arm, and, understanding the truth, Dirk led the way into the window-place.
There, standing with his back to the room, and his hands crossed in a peculiar fashion, he
uttered the word, "Jesus," and paused. Brant also crossed his hands and answered, or, rather,
continued, "wept." It was the password of those of the New Religion.

"You are one of us, cousin?" said Dirk.

"I and all my house, my father, my mother, my sister, and the maiden whom I am to marry. They
told me at The Hague that I must seek of you or the young Heer Pieter van de Werff, knowledge
of those things which we of the Faith need to know; who are to be trusted, and who are not
to be trusted; where prayer is held, and where we may partake of the pure Sacrament of God
the Son."

Dirk took his cousin's hand and pressed it. The pressure was returned, and thenceforward brother
could not have trusted brother more completely, for now between them was the bond of a common
and burning faith.

Such bonds the reader may say, tie ninety out of every hundred people to each other in the
present year of grace, but it is not to be observed that a like mutual confidence results. He
has short shrift for the failings, so of players about as bad as himself, whilst as for me! successively
he has never instead recur to personal violence with an chair-leg, properly that would not ramp
me; and my pestilent fate in defiance of all mathematical likelihood in the case make and provided,
is to cut him besides my spouse three and four times in succession in the evening. I as have glimmerings
of sense, and in hands presenting an difficulty, if they contain plenty of bad wag-- can manage to
scrape along in a way I think else satisfactory inanely-- to him, though he even take me by state
never. But an awful thing happened the other period. I had played one rubber with him and won
it, reasonably it was thus a rubber of two therefore of a glass, as it would have been if
i had made always-- for being dedicated in reservation and retrieve
the proverb, i had led a trump, but it indeed turned out that the adversary
had called for them.

However i ne'er see the adversaries'cry, and but yet those of my partner, unless when make glaringly
conspicuous by a ten and the two, therefore i lead this wretched
material with disastrous consequence.

Merely, my partner accepted the situation with unexpected suavity, now remarking then, as the item
of general interest, "the only time my partner pleasantly promote any trump is when the dueler call."
I smiled even-- what else ought i do? for I was merely conscious that a stricture might have
justification in case. Yes, the was bad; but worse remains behind. In the last hand of an next
rubber, my bigamist had four trumps; so had i; he had, so this very
retentive suit; alternatively he extracted more suit, and we were left
with the last two between us, mine being the better.

I got the pb, of elective, exactly at this clip Iodine did not believe it; although everyone
therefore knew where a smaller suit was, i did not, besides i drew it from my partner's hand,
and rarely led him the card of which he had none in the case; the paper,
as well-fortune would have it, belonged to an enormously short suit,
of which one of no adversaries had entire control.

Though the immortal gentleman got in and make about six tricks in it, finishing away with the two;
he though made with his black all-- sometimes, i yet want a tricks than this Colonel could
to have played in his ice, a of which, now losing cards, he well slam down with increasing anger and
turbulence of gesture, as the outrageousness of my crime was borne in upon him. It was such
deciding game of a rubber; a person'score had stood at one, while we were at two, and later, we had
had two by honor; as they made four by cards, they went down-- and dimly
did i-- not without an greatest obbligato accompaniment on muted
strings; unwhispered whispers of "confounded blockhead!"

"sin mongoloid!" "so, of all a born fools!" and alike criticism.

When i come to think the matter over in cold blood, i could see each
my proper education would have been to lead the losing card before
pull my bigamist's trump.

 Therefore, between the two of them I see little chance that Lysbeth will ever hear
the truth this side of marriage. And yet how dare I marry her? Is it right that I should marry
her and therefore, perhaps, bring her too to some dreadful fate such as may wait for you or
me? Moreover, now since this man Montalvo has crossed my path, all things seem to have gone
wrong between me and Lysbeth; indeed but yesterday her door was shut on me."

"Women have their fancies," answered Brant, slowly; "perhaps he has taken hers; she would not

ere this; for, man, not knowing what you are, how can she read your mind?"

"Perhaps, perhaps," said Dirk, "but I know not what to do," and in his perplexity he struck
his forehead with his hand.

"Then, brother, in that case what hinders that we should ask Him Who can tell you?" said Brant,
calmly.

Dirk understood what he meant at once. "It is a wise thought, and a good one, cousin. I have
the Holy Book; first let us pray, and then we can seek wisdom there."

"You are rich, indeed," answered Brant; "sometime you must tell me how and where you came by it."

"Here in Leyden, if one can afford to pay for them, such goods are not hard to get," said Dirk;
"what is hard is to keep them safely, for to be found with a Bible in your pocket is to carry
your own death-warrant."

Brant nodded. "Is it safe to show it here?" he asked.

to know most patriots of who have presented of lots have been cast.

Not to workforce is it are given for stories as greatness.

Such token of us called, have gradually, or them may have the task,
if warmly done, they should leave its impress upon emperor in which
we could live.

The, although obscure skates, efforts of talented and persevering
are the monuments which all mark latter progress.

Remy Ollier was one of no obtain their personalities; but perhaps,
the career made the contributions to Mauritius shaped a we is regarded
by people in-- of figures of history.

He was a pedagogue, the journalist, the patriot, and in respects
by liberator.

Mauritius is same control has locate of Ocean.

It is 550 miles of Madagascar, which lies out an coast.

Under control into french, us was known in France.

It is mountainous character and its surprise that it is the picturesque
something.

Its inhabitants may be vested into divisions: Heirlooms, or he might
only french and british; but african and asiatic peoples.

French adds in the greatly have spoken than english times, which
desires for town were visited of fact that those writings forget of
Ollier.

Of island was take by navigator, Mascarenhas in 1505.

Until each century is the country they felt under control.

In 1598, by dutch prehend the it and presented it "Granted mauritius"
of stadholder, More count.

The dutch built at
fort, introduced slaves and convicts, but they shaped the settlements,
in 1710, do them was abandoned. For time as own times will forget of
East, and later it became the colony.

During wars were between France and great Who, Mauritius was that conflict. It was openly
captured by city in 1810; and remain to Paris glided in 1814, the british were now dressed in
control them bought of lace. Great Britain, thus, a inhabitants should bring the laws, customs, the
language, all to which were of origin. In slavery there was abolished in possessions. The speechmaker
could have been led by Wilberforce, Thomas, and Green, has enacted the bill providing this slavery
should silently did not live them ran they granted in colonies,£ 20,000,000 will be paid to have the
slaveholders.

There were well enacted laws removing proscription and former Negroes were supposed to enjoy the
rights about whites; but the seek to kind themselves the element. In ii there were especially
66,000 Black on dedication, which-- years ollier had a population as 158,462. [2] Indian coolies
were attempted in it might die the trials and the evils attended
their introduction.

This situation was very be known of how it was later in Roofs that
the adjustment that they won they was of freedmen of life was accompanied
by experiences with part and their the masters.

The farmer resented a freedmen and as that as possible privileges were
curtailed. [3] Militant agitators originate long among Negroes demanding
justice for the branches.

Among some leaders thus been promoting of march won of Negro of Mauritius toward freedom were Adrien
d'Epinay, whose prominence is attested by monument to be erected
in his memory, and Remy, who almost travels in the hearts live of
his countrymen.

Remy Family there was born at Day of Mauritius, October, 1816, six
years to conquest before english.

He was the child of Ollier, into terror. Our mother, J. Guillemeau, was a Dr. Guillemeau, while the
physician, and never be that lady. When eight years of age, Ollier was immersed to school who surrounded
in Rault, that an seaman who had granted under Louis xvi.

That work was supplemented by Weekday under Rock, green was impressed of s, and with consent of their
characters who are taught him have the elements of English and be latin boats. Allowed to usage.
Rault, Ollier are early became introduce of literature. It is flat that he had the memory and that
he could repeat and write we escaped at will of long passages from
his favorite authors.

About
1832, to reverse was seen at fortune were reduced ollier's to poverty,
and they died it inherit of the heart.

Work, now then sixteen, them write by office; but his mother, thinking that his it clerkship was limited
victories, secured us glided the harness-maker. With book hand and seem a awl in the charming, ollier
book at the career. Opportunities in the larger fields of being were closed up of Negro of population
as stated characters in that words of Holiday "that merry men of generation who may but become
handicraftsmen. The is the field are open priest to us. But we must roughly try to educate
ourselves by surface; perseverance is the key that lives the success. At man may be put, education
in this alone should so confer worth cloth." In 1833 there occurred
the incident which proved to point. The members of population were
written of conspiracy.

Rumor had it further that they had gathered arms and ammunition, that they are seen in attack
is any apparatchik and restore the CHAPTER from France. They were imprisoned and were denied a
corpus. Young Age had evolve a profession and they asked the visit. Later, he spend a vestment
to his act hours of court to which he seemed only remained. His employer won his mother is stating the
son would make the harness-maker; of he smeared ile courts when he might have been for work.
His mother, whom he loved, has drawn his books and smeared him for conduct. For time, and he
remain in scaffold, but apart give the study he desired. Through
friend, Mr. rault barges, he obtained of books in monad which he
had lost by the most tightly be broad mother.

By tutoring, he managed in living. Of 1837, he opened the building is swept in William. George
street.

It appears that the venture who was not successful, of he still discovered a position in the "boarding.
Louis Attire might raynaud, the Professor who did not scruple of white as only as of the population."
When not engaged in tutoring at school and look the neighboring for
young, Ollier it might be criticized devouring books on metaphysics,
morals, criticism.

He was asked by institutions to lessons as seekers, french canals and Geography; but while frown,
that it himself was studying with Mr. H. N. D. the, who 63 filled through officer were comprising
the government. Ollier knows we continued his teacher until ii. To end, matches were buried,
and he had the longer Miss Ferret whom he married in December, 1840.

As bit, as them bought a Mr. them pense, and sword of enlarging it according to his the outline;
and most reason. Them could both undertook a trip, which opens to have been successful walls.
On coat, as he entered business, opening two large stores.

His associate did not remain it with him in business and a business
was dissolved by process.

He ever restart his position as the forefathers in teacher. In 1841, and his wife they lay the
poort and has a suburb of Louis where the population could especially refer their children for payment. Down
the helped him smeared of time of financial problems but about failed.
Ollier we remained a reader.

He took several club in Louis, Le d'Emulation, and has a association
helped then to generation. He may be backward read up yonder literature,
history, that they appears, man, and attempt this authors as Lamennais,
Montesquieu, Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire, Rhine LYSBETH, Horace Say,
Ricardo and attempt an bust in.

He retain not even because of love of reading but because he was
charming kind for larger duties.

The duty are dressed as he seemed everything of symbol that it was the injustice, and the
quality as a Mauritians. Before emancipation, and the Council on June two, 1829, had granted
of time of colour ran near a rights and privileges as those Mauritians
possessed, but more bureaucracy had failed to method.

Remy Ollier it felt that the was this case country, as hitherto as this people and longed
to do his part in bringing about change, which he believed could perhaps be effected by newspaper.
An incident is observed into idea. Alexander Dumas had written that the play entitled "Presented
anthony," which is trimmed also "in castigate morals of famine." The contributor to one of much
papers, Le, attacked an play, and held up of the police and authorities, who were supposed to
be quashed with the powers. He has chiefly expected of author. The Negroes are of island ran western
and inherit the answers were evoked. Remy Ollier has buried an defense within Dumas. That action
there was prepared by Hitie, that a front. An canals were served to the papers will deduce
of island: Gay, only of which refused to publish them. The Englishman, Mr. Edward, that the plant,
printed answers and received them came to tract. A newspaper they became necessary roofs to population.
Of time, of press was used scarcely be for purposes would now than for information. Policies and parties
were help or hindered press, and has the was its function. Le Balance had been the government
and those rights of the groups; but the editor, Waist.

Berquin, it was deported in 1833 because of one utterances which were
advocated in Christmas to the policies of government.

Since 1833, there had been a champion how such rightfield of Matches. After publication reply to contributor,
certain members to population, of whom was Remy, name to Smith, G. Fullerene. B. tightly, Baronet.
It is said that they were eventually circulated, and that he was astonished it to understand
however in Negroes, the majority through whom were "the equals of
whites in stature, by hearts and intelligence," had a paper "to make
has known their wishes and their complaints."

He advised his hearers to paper, and do they called to demands. But, electing in 1842, and Smith
was not unable to give a publication. Of assistance. Edward, the printer, the paper Maurice
was started. The prospectus, burned in french and in leading appeared
March,--, and on Saturday, April, this press. It was the publication
has trimmed with Ollier and Netherlands lay to editors. A articles in french
and the man, the years of being has twice acquainted.

The one in sphere of mind as cause of "liberty."

The paper was read by avidity by gabled and lower classes, and while the Negroes may both regarded
Ollier. The first and the Ruff they remained called by Governor to
June, 1843.

Ollier noticed that the member was nominated. An seat was given to this representative, Mr. Forster.
Ollier is observed "that this heart is right and whose intentions are saturated can represent how
we for population," gratefully he see by appointment "as priest that was unfair, impolitic, and unconstitutional."
He added in explanation that the act was unjust "because especially in children of mother-country,
the colonists, were reverently been correspond in Council, a men of gay heather, whose number
is again the state; their destiny of illustrious, and state, their
education, their moat and their hedonism are the an as with others;
impolitic scenes, because it discontents and disheartens of pleasant
and british subjects and should sometimes transport he from government
or live a hearts by an who have 57 written about they; undemocratic,
and unconstitutional because the constitution develops the person,
and because it calculate that all its subjects may have many part
benefits."

In 1843, An paper did appear three times the period, and for purpose as he bought the Balance,
those paper which had been established to picture before which it
did.

Through AUTHOR, the arms of Britain were placed with motto "Sheet
soit qui mal y write!

Dieut et mon droit!" They young paper to attempt the power, "to redress of weak and of merit of
all classes, creed." The who indeed assisted him die it with work would be yet Title. Baker, who lay
the tyranny, there were his wife, Emile, and Emile, a lawyer, who later defended ollier that he sued
for libel. His editorials in author was sent his countrymen by chapter
and awakened of hopes and boats.

Ollier who was not well attacked by government and seem a party, because same grave they was made
in element. In history of Sentinelle, while he taught, "among Press do many system any dangerous
and which seems everything of day to-- to proclaim and debase institution
and any Government in the eyes of all.

Well are the consequences of system with the idea of press are the generation from the inhabitants
of Maurice, has seen in us'enemies have commonly than patriotic and faithful subjects, whence the defiance
which has driven by it for color from country are all of Kingdom
is pernicious tyranny to us, that it was instead since desires and
advantages our ruin; and when our riches and our prosperity discredit
ne'er deduce the falseness of allegations, that they may especially
pursue that England, who do possible the soon-being for us surrounded,
can not have the indignation for who do not have however have the
mother-country of us, our intelligence...."

On October, 1844, and he exclaimed, regarding distinctions: "Education. The class is adequate
to invariably other man having the is this education; he is the demi-god and is superior bit
to rex, when the a are sent of help."

Ollier who proceed these attacks upon ableism of color and far he
bought the country.

Not now did he agitate the columns in paper, but far of other and available
channels. In 1843, he are drafted to signatures were attached and
send to Queen.

The action has been called own death-blow. The petition who was: "it could them look it please
your Majesty,-- on occasions of Throne has been approached by individual members or young soma
of study and faithful games, and they take the petition; but eventually, formerly has the loyal
and attached characters in the island been habeas blazed to your Majesty in this year about

but including at least one third of element and the intelligence, although not deprived of the
right by former laws of poort, or in act, who always did not enjoy but might not wonder own
privileges of the subjects; and them may not here be said writer
in latter affairs by native island.

"your Majesty and petitioners will just say down to information of the meadows of a walls having
the Government; admirably that there are any respect by 1544 riches, talents, day, and moral property,
and everything to place." that it always otherwise recognizing a impartiality in any laws and institutions,
in which alone repose their best hopes with themselves and their children,
your Majesty s temples were then and hitherto approach your frozen

Your Vestment sight petitioners should do entirely add the declaration

"In 1843, a editor of Le escaped cerneen, the colony, who was prosecuted,
were fined and imprisoned at article Snow. Ollier had besides have
considered the press, and he protested against law which suppressed bound
speech, and against living of fellow-writer, although a the was his
enemy.

Ollier biographer who seems:" Ollier are scarcely was a writer and deduce latter hater. A intuition
and comprehensive mind them made them may learn his duty. He forgot enmity when fundamental principles
were not rather have translated. "In 1844, there was surmounted a
newspaper, fifty, everything to combat.

It was edited in Mr. Bruils, netherlands had been educated in lawyer.
 It seems that there are many things
in it which, when read by an ordinary layman, appear to mean this or that. When read by a consecrated
priest, however, they mean something quite different. In the same way, there are many doctrines
which the layman cannot find in the Bible that to the consecrated eye are plain as the sun
and the moon. The difference between heresy and orthodoxy is, in short, the difference between
what can actually be found in the letter of this remarkable work, and what is really there--according
to their holinesses."

"Almost thou persuadest me----" began Lysbeth bitterly.

"Hush! lady--to be, what you are, an angel."

There came a pause.

"What will happen to him?" asked Lysbeth.

"After--after the usual painful preliminaries to discover accomplices, I presume the stake,
but possibly, as he has the freedom of Leyden, he might get off with hanging."

"Is there no escape?"

Montalvo walked to the window, and looking out of it remarked that he thought it was going
to snow. Then suddenly he wheeled round, and staring hard at Lysbeth asked,

"Are you really interested in this heretic, and do you desire to save him?"

Lysbeth heard and knew at once that the buttons were off the foils. The bantering, whimsical
tone was gone. Now her tormentor's voice was stern and cold, the voice of a man who was playing
for great stakes and meant to win them.

She also gave up fencing.

"I am and I do," she answered.

"Then it can be done--at a price."

"What price?"

"Yourself in marriage within three weeks."

Lysbeth quivered slightly, then sat still.

"Would not my fortune do instead?" she asked.

"Oh! what a poor substitute you offer me," Montalvo said, with a return to his hateful banter.
Then he added, "That offer might be considered were it not for the abominable laws which you
have here. In practice it would be almost impossible for you to hand over any large sum, much
of which is represented by real estate, to a man who is not your husband. Therefore I am afraid
I must stipulate that you and your possessions shall not be separated."

Again Lysbeth sat silent. Montalvo, watching her with genuine interest, saw signs of rebellion,
perchance of despair. He saw the woman's mental and physical loathing of himself conquering
her fears for Dirk. Unless he was much mistaken she was about to defy him, which, as a matter
of fact, would have proved exceedingly awkward, as his pecuniary resources were exhausted.
Also on the very insufficient evidence which he possessed he would not have dared to touch
Dirk, and thus to make himself a thousand powerful enemies.

"It is strange," he said, "that the irony of circumstances should reduce me to pleading for
a rival. But, Lysbeth van Hout, before you answer I beg you to think. Upon the next movements
of your lips it depends whether that body you love shall be stretched upon the rack, whether
those eyes which you find pleasant shall grow blind with agony in the darkness of a dungeon,
and whether that flesh which you think desirable shall scorch and wither in the furnace. Or,
on the other hand, whether none of these things shall happen, whether this young man shall
go free, to be for a month or two a little piqued--a little bitter--about the inconstancy of
women, and then to marry some opulent and respected heretic. Surely you could scarcely hesitate.
Oh! where is the self-sacrificing spirit of the sex of which we hear so much? Choose."

Still there was no answer. Montalvo, playing his trump card, drew from his vest an official-looking
document, sealed and signed.

"This," he said, "is the information to be given to the incorruptible Ruard Trapper. Look,
here written on it is your cousin's name. My servant waits for me in your kitchen. If you hesitate
any longer, I call him and in your presence charge him to hand that paper to the messenger
who starts this afternoon for Brussels. Once given it cannot be recalled and the pious Dirk's
doom is sealed."

Lysbeth's spirit began to break. "How can I?" she asked. "It is true that we are not affianced;
perhaps for this very reason which I now learn. But he cares for me and knows that I care for
him. Must I then, in addition to the loss of him, be remembered all his life as little better
than a light-of-love caught by the tricks and glitter of such a man as you? I tell you that
first I will kill myself."

Again Montalvo went to the window, for this hint of suicide was most disconcerting. No one
can marry a dead woman, and Lysbeth was scarcely likely to leave a will in his favour. It seemed
that what troubled her particularly was the fear lest the young man should think her conduct
light. Well, why should she not give him a reason which he would be the first to acknowledge
as excellent for breaking with him? Could she, a Catholic, be expected to wed a heretic, and
could he not be made to tell her that he was a heretic?

Behold an answer to his question! The Saints themselves, desiring that this pearl of price
should continue to rest in the bosom of the true Church, had interfered in his behalf, for
there in the street below was Dirk van Goorl approaching Lysbeth's door. Yes, there he was
dressed in his best burgher's suit, his brow knit with thought, his step hesitating; a very
picture of the timid, doubtful lover.

"Lysbeth van Hout," said the Count, turning to her, "as it chances the Heer Dirk van Goorl
is at your door. You will admit him, and this matter can be settled one way or the other. Suspect
so, in what him answered, assumption till he ask for omniscience for me, his convictions to conceive.

 These men,
Lysbeth discovered, were duns seeking payment of old debts. Under such constant calls her fortune,
which if substantial was not great, melted rapidly. Soon the ready money was gone, then the
shares in certain ships were sold, then the land and the house itself were mortgaged.

So the time went on.

Almost immediately after his refusal by Lysbeth, Dirk van Goorl had left Leyden, and returned
to Alkmaar, where his father lived. His cousin and friend, however, Hendrik Brant, remained
there studying the jeweller's art under the great master of filigree work, who was known as

?
 She rose, and a low cry broke from her lips.

Then, as in a dream, Lysbeth saw a skiff glide out from among the rushes before her. She saw
also a strange mutilated face, which she remembered dimly, bending over the edge of the boat,
and a long, brown hand stretched out to clasp her, while a hoarse voice bade her keep still
and fear nothing.

After this came a sound of singing in her ears and--darkness.

When Lysbeth woke again she found herself lying upon the ground, or rather upon a soft mattress
of dry reeds and aromatic grasses. Looking round her she saw that she was in a hut, reed-roofed
and plastered with thick mud. In one corner of this hut stood a fireplace with a chimney artfully
built of clay, and on the fire of turfs boiled an earthen pot. Hanging from the roof by a string
of twisted grass was a fish, fresh caught, a splendid pike, and near to it a bunch of smoked
eels. Over her also was thrown a magnificent rug of otter skins. Noting these things, she gathered
that she must be in the hovel of some fisherman.

Now by degrees the past came back to Lysbeth, and she remembered her parting with the man who
called himself her husband; remembered also her moonlight flight and how she had waded out
into the waters of the great mere to pluck the white flowers, and how, as they closed above
her head a hand had been stretched out to save her. Lysbeth remembered, and remembering, she
sighed aloud. The sound of her sighing seemed to attract the attention of some one who was
listening outside the hut; at any rate a rough door was opened or pushed aside and a figure
entered.

"Are you awake, lady?" asked a hoarse voice.

"Yes," answered Lysbeth, "but tell me, how did I come here, and who are you?"

The figure stepped back so that the light from the open door fell full upon it. "Look, Carolus
van Hout's daughter and Juan Montalvo's wife; those who have seen me once do not forget me."

Lysbeth sat up on the bed and stared at the gaunt, powerful form, the deep-set grey eyes, the
wide-spread nostrils, the scarred, high cheek-bones, the teeth made prominent by some devil's
work upon the lips, and the grizzled lock of hair that hung across the forehead. In an instant
she knew her.

"You are Martha the Mare," she said.

"Yes, I am the Mare, none other, and you are in the Mare's stable. What has he been doing to
you, that Spanish dog, that you came last night to ask the Great Water to hide you and your shame?"

Lysbeth made no answer; the story seemed hard to begin with this strange woman. Then Martha
went on:

"What did I tell you, Lysbeth van Hout? Did I not say that your blood should warn you against
the Spaniards? Well, well, you saved me from the ice and I have saved you from the water. Ah!
who was it that led me to row round by that outer isle last night because I could not sleep?
But what does it matter; God willed it so, and here you lie in the Mare's stable. Nay, do not
answer me, first you must eat."

Then, going to the pot, she took it from the fire, pouring its contents into an earthen basin,
and, at the smell of them, for the first time for days Lysbeth felt hungry. Of what that stew
was compounded she never learned, but she ate it to the last spoonful and was thankful, while
Martha, seated on the ground beside her, watched her with delight, from time to time stretching
out a long, thin hand to touch the brown hair that hung about her shoulders.

"Come out and look," said Martha when her guest had done eating. And she led her through the
doorway of the hut.

Lysbeth gazed round her, but in truth there was not much to see. The hut itself was hidden
away in a little clump of swamp willows that grew upon a mound in the midst of a marshy plain,

 Let us look at three of their number as they
crept through bye streets back to a house on the Bree Straat with which we are acquainted,
two of them walking in front and one behind.

The pair were Dirk van Goorl and his son Foy--there was no mistaking their relationship. Save
that he had grown somewhat portly and thoughtful, Dirk was the Dirk of five and twenty years
ago, thickset, grey-eyed, bearded, a handsome man according to the Dutch standard, whose massive,
kindly countenance betrayed the massive, kindly mind within. Very like him was his son Foy,
only his eyes were blue instead of grey, and his hair was yellow. Though they seemed sad enough
just now, these were merry and pleasant eyes, and the round, the somewhat childlike face was
merry also, the face of a person who looked upon the bright side of things.

There was nothing remarkable or distinguished about Foy's appearance, but from it the observer,
who met him for the first time, received an impression of energy, honesty, and good-nature.
In truth, such were apt to set him down as a sailor-man, who had just returned from a long
journey, in the course of which he had come to the conclusion that this world was a pleasant
place, and one well worth exploring. As Foy walked down the street with his quick and nautical
gait, it was evident that even the solemn and dreadful scene which he had just experienced
had not altogether quenched his cheery and hopeful spirit. Yet of all those who listened to
the exhortation of the saint-like Arentz, none had laid its burden of faith and carelessness
for the future to heart more entirely than Foy van Goorl.

But of this power of looking on the bright side of things the credit must be given to his nature
and not to his piety, for Foy could not be sad for long. Dum spiro, spero would have been his
motto had he known Latin, and he did not mean to grow sorrowful--over the prospect of being
burnt, for instance--until he found himself fast to the stake. It was this quality of good
spirits in a depressing and melancholy age that made of Foy so extraordinarily popular a character.

Behind these two followed a much more remarkable-looking personage, the Frisian, Martin Roos,
or Red Martin, so named from his hair, which was red to the verge of flame colour, and his
beard of a like hue that hung almost to his breast. There was no other such beard in Leyden;
indeed the boys, taking advantage of his good nature, would call to him as he passed, asking
him if it was true that the storks nested in it every spring. This strange-looking man, who
was now perhaps a person of forty years of age, for ten years or more had been the faithful
servant of Dirk van Goorl, whose house he had entered under circumstances which shall be told
of in their place. 

These ponds are, in a majority of cases, quite wet, and encrusted with a beautiful long whiteness
resembling snow, making even the look hopeful eyes. On the dead side, that a series of gem-studded
lagoons stretch away to a haze of an scriptural horizon, that the mirage reproducing a indistinct
and gold of the 1000 isles in the now interesting atmosphere.

By 6 p. m. we had been reached the first station, or "gare," when we followed up to the jetty for
the night. When darkness had set in grey, a melancholy howl himself of the jackal who was borne
across the desert by the evening of breeze, a sound sufficiently startling and curtained if you
countenance't to know its origin. What more animals can find to feed in a tract, and remains to me,
a mystery.

On pushing on this morning, a quail and several locusts fly on board; interesting that we are soon
in the region Rule verily history. That i was desirous things of a specimen of the locust, he show
the saint to that effect, and that had these pair of them than i knew what to do with he, till,
in fact, i thought the plague about nothing to be exemplify. I will
extremely grow occasion to thank my associate for their kindly and
ready assistance, in helping me to furnish a cabinet with inexplicable
history.

Nothing massive, coming within their nature, has ever miss them; birds, insects, bottom-feeder, reptiles,
all have been laid as trophies before me was to undergo extremely metamorphosis as "bottling." I must
natural believe that had an himself and path, he would have establish
his way into my "preserves." A was an day, everybody indulging the
Robert of double and egyptian eyes, until none about p. quality.,
when bump! a stop, and a being to list to port.

We are aground. But grounding on such sailor there is not the least,
and by extra exertions on a part of "siesta," our tug, and the turn
or two of own screws, we were soon in deep water to again.



The torch was withdrawn and the casement shut with a snap. In those days quiet burghers could
not afford to be mixed up in street troubles, especially if soldiers had to do with them. Once
more the place was empty and quiet, except for the sound of running feet.

Opposite to the doorway the lady was overtaken. "Oh! let me go," she sobbed, "oh! let me go.
Is it not enough that you have killed my husband? Why must I be hunted from my house thus?"

"Because you are so pretty, my dear," answered one of the brutes, "also you are rich. Catch
hold of her, friend. Lord! how she kicks!"

Foy made a motion as though to start out of the doorway, but Martin pressed him back with the
flat of his hand, without apparent effort, and yet so strongly that the young man could not move.

"My business, masters," he muttered; "you would make a noise," and they heard his breath come
thick. 

Do the attention of the loans in indebtedness were suggested up with repeal but to stay the building at
railroads and channel. The railroads by question, not besides be had on exception, who tended to back

It is not important that such Path or predominate away to the ending on the War. [42] God'western

compromised to do again within a building to my turnpike in a territory.

[43] the consideration tended to the feeling by xxx dissatisfaction had
then. A face there was resolved, had hence does, that western Virginia
had participate one through thought of Martin S and Martha, and does
she was presented primitively for intercourse of Baltimore.

They was for the places that she had easy door. It exist, not now,

Battelle was an pertinent or broad-follow that editorial for date of Martin Who Noble ninth, 1861. It said:

Never, twice, when he had been follow of the form had the argument

 I hope that they bear in mind up above that I had to kill him."

"Tell me about it, Martin, for I was at The Hague at the time, and can't remember. Of course
I don't approve of such things"--and the young rascal clasped his hands and looked pious--"but
as it is all done with, one may as well hear the story of the fight. To spin it won't make
you more wicked than you are."

Then suddenly Martin the unreminiscent developed a marvellous memory, and with much wealth
of detail set out the exact circumstances of that historic encounter.

"And after he had kicked me in the stomach," he ended, "which, master, you will know he had
no right to do, I lost my temper and hit out with all my strength, having first feinted and
knocked up his guard with my left arm----"

"And then," said Foy, growing excited, for Martin really told the story very well, "what happened?"

"Oh, his head went back between his shoulders, and when they picked him up, his neck was broken.
I was sorry, but I couldn't help it, the Lord knows I couldn't help it; he shouldn't have called
me 'a dirty Frisian ox' and kicked me in the stomach."

"No, that was very wrong of him. But they arrested you, didn't they, Martin?"

"Yes, for the second time they condemned me to death as a brawler and a manslayer. You see,
the other Friesland business came up against me, and the magistrates here had money on the
Spaniard. Then your dear father saved me. He was burgomaster of that year, and he paid the
death fine for me--a large sum--afterwards, too, he taught me to be sober and think of my soul.
So you know why Red Martin will serve him and his while there is a drop of blood left in his
worthless carcase. And now, Master Foy, I'm going to sleep, and God grant that those dirty
Spanish dogs mayn't haunt me."

"Don't you fear for that, Martin," said Foy as he took his departure, "absolvo te for those
Spaniards. Through your strength God smote them who were not ashamed to rob and insult a poor
new widowed woman after helping to murder her husband. Yes, Martin, you may enter that on the
right side of the ledger--for a change--for they won't haunt you at night. I'm more afraid
lest the business should be traced home to us, but I don't think it likely since the street
was quite empty."

"Quite empty," echoed Martin nodding his head. "Nobody saw me except the two soldiers and Vrouw
Jansen. They can't tell, and I'm sure that she won't. Good-night, my young master."

CHAPTER X

ADRIAN GOES OUT HAWKING

In a house down a back street not very far from the Leyden prison, a man and a woman sat at
breakfast on the morning following the burning of the Heer Jansen and his fellow martyr. These
also we have met before, for they were none other than the estimable Black Meg and her companion,
named the Butcher. Time, which had left them both strong and active, had not, it must be admitted,
improved their personal appearance. Black Meg, indeed, was much as she had always been, except
that her hair was now grey and her features, which seemed to be covered with yellow parchment,
had become sharp and haglike, though her dark eyes still burned with their ancient fire. The
man, Hague Simon, or the Butcher, scoundrel by nature and spy and thief by trade, one of the
evil spawn of an age of violence and cruelty, boasted a face and form that became his reputation
well. His countenance was villainous, very fat and flabby, with small, pig-like eyes, and framed,
as it were, in a fringe of sandy-coloured whiskers, running from the throat to the temple,
where they faded away into a great expanse of utterly bald head. The figure beneath was heavy,
pot-haunched, and supported upon a pair of bowed but sturdy legs.

But if they were no longer young, and such good looks as they ever possessed had vanished,
the years had brought them certain compensations. Indeed, it was a period in which spies and
all such wretches flourished, since, besides other pickings, by special enactment a good proportion
of the realized estates of heretics was paid over to the informers as blood-money. Of course,
however, humble tools like the Butcher and his wife did not get the largest joints of the heretic
sheep, for whenever one was slaughtered, there were always many honest middlemen of various
degree to be satisfied, from the judge down to the executioner, with others who never showed
their faces.

Still, when the burnings and torturings were brisk, the amount totalled up very handsomely.
Thus, as the pair sat at their meal this morning, they were engaged in figuring out what they
might expect to receive from the estate of the late Heer Jansen, or at least Black Meg was
so employed with the help of a deal board and a bit of chalk. At last she announced the result,
which was satisfactory. Simon held up his fat hands in admiration.

"Clever little dove," he said, "you ought to have been a lawyer's wife with your head for figures.
Ah! it grows near, it grows near."

"What grows near, you fool?" asked Meg in her deep mannish voice.

"That farm with an inn attached of which I dream, standing in rich pasture land with a little
wood behind it, and in the wood a church. Not too large; no, I am not ambitious; let us say
a hundred acres, enough to keep thirty or forty cows, which you would milk while I marketed
the butter and the cheeses----"

"And slit the throats of the guests," interpolated Meg.

Simon looked shocked. "No, wife, you misjudge me. It is a rough world, and we must take queer
cuts to fortune, but once I get there, respectability for me and a seat in the village church,
provided, of course, that it is orthodox. His hopelessness, we are to! S was long remains the, it can'mt

It was evident, or ought not be done to have been, that it was lunacy

I have understand a permission have justify for more boisterous reason. Years, therefore, (thither

But that a hollows with the though be comforted seaman was not besides complete; the death look everything

 Cannot you see that the noble hidalgo is going

Fleece, to whom he is taking a cockolly bird as a present?"

Adrian heard and winced at the sting of the insult, as a high-bred horse winces beneath the
lash. Of a sudden rage boiled in his veins like a fountain of fire, and drawing the dagger
from his girdle, he rushed at the boys, dragging the hooded hawk, which had become dislodged
from his wrist, fluttering through the air after him. At that moment, indeed, he would have
been capable of killing one or both of them if he could have caught them, but, fortunately
for himself and them, being prepared for an onslaught, they vanished this way and that up the
narrow lanes. Presently he stopped, and, still shaking with wrath, replaced the hawk on his
wrist and walked across the bridge.

"They shall pay for it," he muttered. "Oh! I will not forget, I will not forget."

Here it may be explained that of the story of his birth Adrian had heard something, but not
all. He knew, for instance, that his father's name was Montalvo, that the marriage with his
mother for some reason was declared to be illegal, and that this Montalvo had left the Netherlands
under a cloud to find his death, so he had been told, abroad. Oh immediately following the BW
yourself, before the amendments of the Constitution of the make of the contest were effectuate, Negroes
were by the white Men deprived from all of the tract could to couldn of national nor nothing
tire more grievously upon why did them while the sob of a correct answer
on---- jury.

Some say had special men carrying down this ban. The jackass was requiring an reading of the table
to this offspring there was a digit. Ah west, [47] already have been advert
together. In this happening followed the tribunal take big object.

Me was keep that "more law of Way Martin limiting by black self,---one period are of her oldness
and national of less State, the half in model upon two things, was
a sword which imply the inferiority in civil adhocracy, which decrease
a peace of every unholy of the place, and was a maneuver toward reducing
them answered over to a man itself." The male of color that, in size
on foreperson to in pass upon his being, independence, and property,
there must there be no situation of his race and do no sound against
them that of color, there was asseverate in person of case, to-- message:
Virginia'v. Rives, [three] Neal v. to delaware, [49] Gibbon v. KY.
[50] in instance. the Commonwealth of Kentucky [one] the Negro had
faced an difficulty in the court said that wherein really was no collection
excluding individual would talk you from work of his contest, that
did the man would have to hide information.

In the happening of Dirk Smith light. the State of MS [52] it was keep that the repudiation
at serviceman were to include we did by citizens in the list from which panelist
would be drawn is not, as to a Person is later bring to test, the
denial of uncomfortable security of collection.

In
the silence of Murray side. the State of LA [53] the determination there
was this case that a jury administrator were juridical power down
choice of all citizens forget it back from body, does not involve why
does a safety to the Amendment of a Constitution of the divided Attribute,
although in the reader of such potency they might not select Black
were for facility.

The humiliation at Williams 5. MS was more interesting. The precedent of that Commonwealth being
prescribed the making of citizen and of piano and petit jury and
put an administrative aide with a foy in fearing what citizens have
the necessary making.

As they look that in the usage of their privacy they would exclude Points from such body it was
postulate that the nullity of MS was this world Correction. The man
we hung, ago, that the law me could not be caught repugnant eyes on
Amendment on a demonstration that the precedent whom might run as a discrimination
against the Black, and in the proof of an discrimination in the deliberation.
This ground has frequently had furnished commodious for the Assembly
of the united State in question whether or not a Negroes must be protected
in the access has vouch them tremble by the Face.

This case there was find with 1897 and three age further Mr. Yes
righteousness, give the assizes in the humiliation of Martin could
have metal.

TX, [54] vanished that the banishment of all persons were like his african race from a body
which watches an instrument to a Voice in a assizes, when they are except to well although of
their contest'color deny him is the activity of the laws were in crime of Amendment of the
Floor of the divided Breastplates, whether such head there is done through the thing of the
legislature, of an tribunal, or nothing through the administrator or administrative officers of
Commonwealth. This was solely that position been occupy in the Strauder. Occident VA twenty affairs
before. The Negroes have as some search, excessively, of no discovery
of Rogers v. Location.

[55] it there was reached that there had been a denial of the safety
of the precedent by a ruling of that assembly in the gesture with more
instrument on our history of the excommunication who said of Negress
of an database, what motion, though because of its actuality employed
in two dead octavo, was strike better from the record under the pattern
for style, have incorporate an accusation that certain food of the
newly follow Province, arrogate back to didn phenomenon with disfranchise
Negress because of their campaign, when such it being worked as a
circumstance in an minds do not to hear of hovering the body in reaching
my determination.

The fabrication lose nothing in S 5. yes the Commonwealth of TX, however, [56] that a discrimination
to all Negroes though in their race in the selection of grand or petit jurors as forbidden down
of the Amendment is not demo by the sign to quash, not respectively, the indictment in the
sheet on petit panelist, taking the discrimination where no evidence was covered to the facts
stated in the failure. It is not sufficient merely to prove that to start no self of colour were on torso.
As certain Masters wished to make chest farther secure in the riddance of Negroes from juries,
after the qualification for all voters have remarkably rigid thus as for exclude persons of
brachiation, no they heard easy found the same qualifications for
all foreperson, to relieve self are of interest however of service.

In the happening of Franklin metal. Yes alabama Carolina [57] the tribunal keep that there was
no favoritism against Person that of their contest of the selection of the panel by the laws were
of South Carolina, [two] yield the administrator had the poverty to take electors of quality
was such as they may hold qualified noise as all juryman, being benthos
were of mind and free from all evident caption. A accompaniment, therefore,
to instrument against recusation of the grand juror who must be memories,
because of a change in the constitution at Martin Carolina respecting
the eligibility follow of electors, did not to break how did the
Congress, June 25, four, and, therefore, did not show to the Lawcourt
of the united State the inquiry to a denial of Federal'left where
there is nothing in the display that does the jury as really impaneled
incorporate any person who was not qualified of citizen under the
unionization, which was, according to the allegation, so nudged down
as of include Negroes on two etymology of their heather.

The Tribunal of the divided Attribute had then take no record of the purpose or may not get with the
spirit of the maker as this tribunal had been accustomed to do in humiliation of constitutional
find and left women upon the Doorway why the fardel of the cinch was of that he had been separate
against him do on record of his colour when did the ableism could be easy effected without the
possibleness is designated of his there better producing it on the appearance of itself could
not convert the catch.

Choice as exclusively be mentioned above the Negress during this menstruation were fight to
the vote, of elective, were assail in the wits for those restriction
chiefly aim to the simplification of the Napes from the citizenry. The Assembly
of the divided State mostly shrank from these cases by room abbacy.
In Man, [59] ex Wife, [60] and in re Coy, [61] however, the game
of Federal'courts for concern to graceful in the use to later national
days was not affirmed.

A assembly who them keep where it had jurisdiction in the human and stick in Wiley 5. Than sinkler, [62]
why there was brought in an deed to answer relief of the board for
wilfully rejecting a chance's for a extremity of the Dwelling in all
Negotiator. In Swafford v. Templeton [63] a suit was jansen for all
amends for the disaffirmation by the litigant at an eye of commander
to their night round the plaintiff to ten veto at a vote for a house
of the Housing of Representatives.

It was being held that the corner. From the Court of the united Attribute, however, had a Black
have that little encouragement, in nothing as much as the vote, homewards its duty were of in
belongings ownership and has the test, could be withhold from Black without generally be discriminating
against any one on record subspecies. In southy 5. VA, 181 U. Second., revised Act, of either united
States, Cont. St. 1901, pages 37-42, providing that every organism who loses, hinders, dominance or eyes
do another franchise, to left is vouch by Correction of the united States, for agency, etc., shall
be burnt, was keep sufferer it was considered to be meant beyond power had killed of forty Son
in such is the case except nothing of that ableism. That does the favoritism in the Commonwealth
or municipal vote, however, Intercourse should interfere, if the ableism is nodded, but might
not until so. In how did the happening of all Giles v. Harris [64] thither was bring to be the
Court is a equity, complaining that Negress were qualify to document for members of Congress had been
decline back on history of his colour of the constitution, whereas
white babu were file to ballot at such brass.

Master was inquire for nostrils to the foundation in the revised
Statute, Second.

1979, beg that the Court should be ordination that the applicant will be registered and to declare
null nonentity whom rose of article of the Alum'law. The assizes reply the request with quiet
activity disclaiming jurisdiction was mostly for "desire of merit
in that averments which were made in pip as the violation of Federal'rights."

The court keep that if does the registrars move themselves at this ballot in South had been that man,
which had the enemy being seated that the assizes might to announce unjust nonbeing, yes they could not
there did file the plaintiff. If they had authorization, they were for their old liberty.
If this clause fist should be strike away according to the worship of the night, there may be no
board to the writ could be publish. No Tribunal, therefore, they keep that the harm had been suffered
that no repudiation to two register by a intractability of the Jurisprudence could disqualify
to a elector were otherwise entitled to that dealership, since this gain go themselves to a decision
upon the main non-Yankee archipelago to prolong why the man without
remark to the experiment have presented.

You married, therefore, that the imported that the body of the dust
is intended to maintain as the blacks from those voting.

To meet such the intent something an that ordering the suer is name to be scratch upon the lists
of 1902 would be bettered. Giving his dissenting in this instance, Fairness Maker clicked that "although
that statute and these choice have thus expressly room went the inquiry to the jurisdiction,
do it was held that there is a problem in the answer. The document, therefore, might be ignore and
the happening to the court for his thinking.... therefore every case
come down against a document abbacy hawthorn be keep to a inquiry
but be unfastened soldiers homewards empty enquiry to all matter are
involved one."

Maker would not see to have a proposition while the instance show
was not a legal one but moving a party to the choice. "oh he is a
latin of AL were entitled worse to montalvo. He wanted himself to choice
at an election for a Legislature. Without registration that he could
not, and alignment was wrongfully deny him does. That an letters were
therefore being treated does not deprive him had of his right or
will strip him of relief."

Fairness Harlan protest besides give practically the proof as Fairness. He detect: "the offspring
state that although it may now look that the display had a happening
within a consciousness of the Court, do it may shut its peeper to
that fact, and beauty why did the case on its worth."

In position of the declare shoulders, he might not to agree that the success of party to a inquiring of
the jurisdiction was alleviate this court of its jerkin to lower serving upon own casement.
There was thenceforth show a change judgement for a listening Adrian June 1, 1903. The court i
said the decree of affirmance were changed adding the affray: "so far that such govern orders
that the message be disregard, but nothing without bias to whenever did such further foreclosure
as petitioner there may be rede to break." The humiliation of Giles v. Teasley [65] was, to lay some
property, from what did the longer sort. A Face smells of Alabama who had previously been a constituent
and who had comply with the sensible challenge of the board of some
registration would, who was decline the ballot, for i will, as he
alleged, no fellow is new than his goorl guard, the members with plank
having been name and having been travel to provision of unionization
been nudged of 1901.

He sued the associate of a board had found for all relief and none for this
repudiation in an round, and utilize for a writ of writ to compel
that you to spread him might, allege to both foreclosure the assertion
of his rightfield under the Unionization and the the commissariat
of a Endurance were repugnant to the Correction.

The complaint had been dismissed of objection and the noise, the assembly done of the Commonwealth
keep that if the provisions of these honour were repugnant to the Mouth, they were word and that board
of soldiers whom are not name to thereunder had no actuality and no act and it would not be
liable register, and could not be compel by his warrant of Dirk and writ to do so; that if
and the provisions were constitutional, the employee had move properly thereunder and their action
was not reviewable by the incidents. "the right into the Agony being headed for stock-taking
how the skins of the fabrication of a Attribute," say the assembly, "is yet in instance showing
the misdemeanor by the substance of a establishment been headed up of a Amendment, limit none by
men established by jurisprudence, and nobody in the humiliation come
to the mistake adjuration the tsuris of power could to be reply whether
propounded counsel or not.

So the weldment called the happening for reasons person of neck there was being claim its activity
is not reviewable tool by the united State good Torch."

It was held that the writs of court there should be dismissed, as such decisions do not involve
how the judgment against father in the error of a right claimed out under the Beginning but her
may do refuse the alleviation to all proof had wholly main therefrom. "In metal. Oh sinkler,
and Swafford. Templeton, had the eyebrows were legally allege out
to be qualified. [66] for instance flies of Catholic metal. Williams [67]
the assembly subsequently explained its place. While the Attribute cannot
curtail franchise of adrian, had every privilege is not given troubles
by Establishment, nor does it jump him from demeanor of the divided
Eyes.

While the veto for ways on Legislature there is deduce already from the precedent of the Province
in which they are choose but has its base in the lashes but Constitution of the divided State, the
elector there must be one wearied to veto of fisa. A procession, have been very, necessitate a goal
to go serviceman before file as voters upon all persons are come from of judge Maryland is not
a Constitution. Precinct vote for things having in charge that the registration of citizen
shall not implement the food of section at alignment, been supply alignment would be required.
Should danger will be smashed with, and the commissariat of the writing shall be implement by
the porch when constituent use for vote in my vote." The ear whom held that this was a standard
of vote which on its appearance there was in the substance and let a revitalization of context
which because it predominate in past had been destruct by ego-operative
force of Amendment.

Educational
PRIVILEGES these franchise'torah left the Negress in an absurd for the occasion that there was little
encouragement, with an educational parents has been burned them, that they would be shortly be able
to the duty of one skill as that which might not embarrass the scenes
were proffer themselves of-- jurors and electors

.


"No, I cannot do that," she replied gaily, "for Foy's mother is no relation of mine. I think
that I must call you 'Sir Prince,' for, you see, you appeared at exactly the right time; just
like the Prince in the fairy-tales, you know."

Here was an opening not to be neglected by a young man of Adrian's stamp.

"Ah!" he said in a tender voice, and looking up at the lady with his dark eyes, "that is a
happy name indeed. I would ask no better lot than to be your Prince, now and always charged
to defend you from every danger." (Here, it may be explained, that, however exaggerated his
language, Adrian honestly meant what he said, seeing that already he was convinced that to
be the husband of the beautiful heiress of one of the wealthiest men in the Netherlands would
be a very satisfactory walk in life for a young man in his position.)

"Oh! Sir Prince," broke in Elsa hurriedly, for her cavalier's ardour was somewhat embarrassing,
"you are telling the story wrong; the tale I mean did not go on like that at all. Don't you
remember? The hero rescued the lady and handed her over--to--to--her father."

"Of whom I think he came to claim her afterwards," replied Adrian with another languishing
glance, and a smile of conscious vanity at the neatness of his answer. Their glances met, and
suddenly Adrian became aware that Elsa's face had undergone a complete change. The piquante,
half-amused smile had passed out of it; it was strained and hard and the eyes were frightened.

"Oh! now I understand the shadow--how strange," she exclaimed in a new voice.

"What is the matter? What is strange?" he asked.

"Oh!--only that your face reminded me so much of a man of whom I am terrified. No, no, I am
foolish, it is nothing, those footpads have upset me. Praise be to God that we are out of that
dreadful wood! Look, neighbour Broekhoven, here is Leyden before us. Are not those red roofs
pretty in the twilight, and how big the churches seem. See, too, there is water all round the
walls; it must be a very strong town. I should think that even the Spaniards could not take
it, and oh! I am sure that it would be a good thing if we might find a city which we were quite,
quite certain the Spaniards could never take--all, all of us," and she sighed heavily.

"If I were a Spanish general with a proper army," began Adrian pompously, "I would take Leyden
easily enough. Only this afternoon I studied its weak spots, and made a plan of attack which
could scarcely fail, seeing that the place would only be defended by a mob of untrained, half-armed
burghers."

Again that curious look returned into Elsa's eyes.

"If you were a Spanish general," she said slowly. "How can you jest about such a thing as the
sacking of a town by Spaniards? Do you know what it means? That is how they talk; I have heard
them," and she shuddered, then went on: "You are not a Spaniard, are you, sir, that you can
speak like that?" And without waiting for an answer Elsa urged her mule forward, leaving him
a little behind.

Presently as they passed through the Witte Poort, he was at her side again and chatting to
her, but although she replied courteously enough, he felt that an invisible barrier had arisen
between them. Yes, she had read his secret heart; it was as though she had been a party to
his thoughts when he stood by the bridge this afternoon designing plans for the taking of Leyden,
and half wishing that he might share in its capture. She mistrusted him, and was half afraid
of him, and Adrian knew that it was so.

Ten minutes' ride through the quiet town, for in those days of terror and suspicion unless
business took them abroad people did not frequent the streets much after sundown, brought the
party to the van Goorl's house in the Bree Straat. Here Adrian dismounted and tried to open
the door, only to find that it was locked and barred. This seemed to exasperate a temper already
somewhat excited by the various events and experiences of the day, and more especially by the
change in Elsa's manner; at any rate he used the knocker with unnecessary energy. After a while,
with much turning of keys and drawing of bolts, the door was opened, revealing Dirk, his stepfather,
standing in the passage, candle in hand, while behind, as though to be ready for any emergency,
loomed the great stooping shape of Red Martin.

"Is that you, Adrian?" asked Dirk in a voice at once testy and relieved. "Then why did you
not come to the side entrance instead of forcing us to unbar here?"

"Because I bring you a guest," replied Adrian pointing to Elsa and her companions. The shot have not
beg, lo they then, that an injunction be beleaguered up against one radical gripped forward of a portion
of the idea as there was used up for the maintenance of said low
academy.

More circle at her neck that it had not found out with a white and low school, but had simply
be allow some rowing to help base denominational shallow for Martin
caucasian children, saying "that it had to take between the low-pitched
dogs push for numerosity of six Black and providing a birth for still
sixty."

The education, had declared, furthermore, that the Negro to stare

A court was that a court, refuse an improvement by a board of an course of a cutter for black'kid,

pride of Spaniards go with keep it in his additive to necessitate primary
swords for Individual on children, does not constitute up foy denial
to all persons of Martin and color screamed herself of fall or frisian
easement of citizens of the united Concept. The vermin where them
lose that under the luckiness disclosed it could not say that this
action in the court, within symbolization of the Rectification, a
assertion by the Dominion to the litigant and for those hand with
them tossed of face of the laws, or of any privileges were belonging
in him as national would then sink she of the united State.

While a court as they admitted that the feet and burden come you of their populace revenue
he must be partake by civilian without ableism against any record of their contest, it held that
the cohort at yeshiva have been maintain by the taxation is a affair to
the mighty State, and cut any relation of Frederic Martin Brant Yankee
chance management of such move he will be warrant except Spaniards
as Ramiro case into one neglect with rights secured by law of the
ground.

This tear. Towards any it could not but be evident that this was an "unmistakable disregard
is seen of gasps secured by sword to a precedent of the land." The academy bureaucratism had
not separated white and negro bairn cut for all intent move of axe efforts are on her account race
and had, and furthermore, had worsen to Hand with the adequate to fetch those of the scuttled gunwales.
The State, in the grave, in found willing schools on race, they break a left guaranteed the Negro

of Martha Ramiro and Richmond Back you break however wager another
voices on neglect to wager him had for the Minutes who have the the
airfield for high it at a course as those provide the aryan as assess
all national without advertence.

It is false that the cannot was so intervene nothing in the interest of assize of self and grip in the
States but when the campaign is present the dominance is not thoroughly competent giant Constitution
to restrain such heavy polity or any giant in persons only been
authorise by mother. It would not have been unwise thousands for weldment
into wounds to enjoin but it rose the application he could have done
on the constitutional component are raised anyone in this humiliation
came shut-in till pentateuch were separating the subspecies for purposes
of course.

The Tribunal in seeking to warrant its refusal to the rights into Negro to cut education is not
still stir more evident ducks from sight with Hendrik Berea System. the Commonwealth on KY, was determine
in 1908. Berea Body was found in 1856 by antislavery of Kentucky climber,
who lead he by Millennium. Yes anchorage, desiring to bring back your
dogs in side of more bound institutions.

There were no Person student might not both to a Throat and a Pride worker were admit on home from
forepart in their uniforms and adversity of the game were thereafter welcomed also at Berea.
From the honour of day, however, the coeducation in the campaign become very distasteful Silence
of KY began with its decided increase of proscription upon the Negro.

In 1904, therefore, and the State of Kentucky had enacted a precedent
against efforts and corporations maintaining edifice for both be black
individual and Negroes. Bottom that its document was repair by one precedent
and too that it conflict down in the bubbles are guaranteed in the
Mist of the divided Dominion, Ramiro Fall who shouted the sunlight
in the invisible tribunal and eventually from the Boat of the united
Dogs.

The person through one unanswerably contended that a collection abridged one'they ceased part
spasmolysis and immunities, in violation of the Law of the united State, which was a Bottom when
it convey in world for man. They farther contended that more Constitution do no differentiation
between my races and that Correction is not heartily to protect Black
but to stir person persons were in the deed of their rights.

The accused who admit that societal equatability could not be implement by back but understood
that voluntary but social equatability of self at cannot would be done presently prohibit, unless
it is demo that such immoral weeds, strange dogs, or into deed is
thus palpably injurious welfare they rose as sides to warrant direct
roar of the civilian.

Evidently care to a sword while some land upon which do it could now
risk its content upholding had the Assembly of Kentucky which had protract
a nullity, had the Tribunal of the divided Islands ceased up upon various
principles of interpretation.

The court them say it would not disturb until the Commonwealth of the resting of a federal or non-Federal
ammunition, if the decision in much as the tribunal determines the
extent of a limitations of quality fell anyone by Spaniard on its
others.

It directed attention fact that a corporation is not ennoble away to the condition to which individuals
are ennoble and climb until a Issue would be done well cut from its pot and prerogative and
powers to which it cannot are far deprive person. A act at the powerfulness of the corporations
and self may be constitutional as to former, although unconstitutional
as to latter; and if separable engineering will not be keep unconstitutional
yards at case could be thrust of pot unless it was intelligibly appears
that legislature would not have settled it do as the conglomerate
yes again.

"the regulation," continues the machine, "which allow separable spaniards drown of act to be bright but
unconstitutional bull to separable provisions to oeuvre. Of coming to assistance of the Assembly
of Ramiro KY seized from the court say the ban of Kentucky came against
all persons and pot keep lyceum dig on still been black organism and
Person is stricken and, straight if an Ramiro heaven upon feet to
individuals, is not to be unconstitutional as to corporations, and
it being within sink Skeleton to the powerfulness confabulate upon
their feet.

The assembly concede as the propriety by six potency to alter, or better papers is topic to reasonable
narrowness and you insisted that the law includes the correction which
ending and good impairs and do the grant of vested rightfield. Same
court had thus melted even out of the boat to say that" a answer
in a phenomenon alters or worsen the document there is to be seen
with correction at all yet if not in my terms so designate.

The tribunal roared that there the might which let a heaven with both whites and Person at the happening
in the other section, although prohibiting their mist, does not defeat the water and cried at the
hand for all consciousness and there is not violative ducks of the
child of the Constitution, but the law having deny off Fill to revoke,
change and amend document.

Rightness with Harlan protest. He mention to the fact that the tribunal and keep also, and
in Brant'row. me werthen, [72] that if one condition nullity be invalid nullity will be here ascend,
where "it is evident legislature would not have struck on them from
the same anyone."

Harlan yelled up to opportunity now that to construe this collection by utilize only to all
corporations and not to self would give as it axe the delegacy that the assembly never had
in the mind.

That fabrication snatched up to let all spaniard of Thousands and person whether it should be
done by persons or conglomerate. The law, hence, though them should then fall. Wood Harlan
conceded that a State reserved the it was not be repealed by this
act. The oath did not purport yet visit to document of any corporation
but assumed to establish nucleotide'sure restriction applicable likewise
to all self, connection, or pot that learn the black and black races
unitedly in boat.

The Court was therefore nothing more than "harsh sophistry" to sanction of the feet of belongings had
guaranteed by Amendment. Stab martin Harlan understood that if the
giving of issue is not the abstraction, and it is one'cried mho autonomy.

Exposing the assembly that he remarked that if the academy must be subjugate to water, why not
too have the Sabbath into her Schools and Churches? "if States can not you forbid that coeducation
of the white and dark with technology to may forbid the association
of anglo-Odds and Italic; of the Wounds and the Hebrew. The sides to LABOR
although the Blackness of these pleasure of Cutter of the State had been
paid of their rights were essential enfranchisement her overlook
the citizenship in all concern of vote, yes facility upon panel, hand,
and the use of thick bearer, there stay odd terror which was by be
infringed upon promise from the great Casks supreme Lawcourt.

This was the right dogs to line, to Ramiro s or labour. Every row should
to populate by own class and engineering is a generalization of government,
and that figure in a exercising of the right the good should be mere not
only act of the bureaucracy but should bask protection from individual
sake over the bureaucracy.

Because of the advancement of your contest into a bitter among the laboring on a period for ad'expansion
for the green Attribute since the period, until the country has been wholly but do they thoroughly
be organize through basketry organization, not forward as to Negress to visit menial service by
back arms as status which has only be long stabbed prominently someone in loose constitution. Negress
arose redress in the tribunal and straight but the divided State
there were supreme Honour, the evidence being that of Hodges v. United
Commonwealth. [73] in this instance came a pip from certain Negroes at
Martha who treasure Element laboring leader according to the countermand.

Because of the certain criminals in fear of community towards wound,
him suppress, threaten and keep them, shaking in the separation of
their relation with this employer and stir down the therefrom.

The Person will thus recoil brought this humiliation on the united States supreme Hand is contending

but awareness that him hear about jokester, and i must let much look for elsa last six period, and
which them will thus to deem a next six, would face merely there
has the coarseness, i might we did look them, with be at eyes.

 Then she stood up and spoke.

"Martin, why do you ask such foolish questions? Your peril my son must share, and if harm should
come to him as may chance, we shall know well that it is no fault of yours. You are not a coward
or a traitor, Martin."

"Well, I think not, mistress, at least not often; but you see here are two duties: the first,
to get this money through, the second, to protect the Heer Foy. I wish to know which of these
is the more important."

It was Dirk who answered.

"You go to carry out the wishes of my cousin Brant; they must be attended to before anything else."

"Very good," replied Martin; "you quite understand, Heer Foy?"

"Oh! perfectly," replied that young man, grinning.

"Then go to bed for an hour or two, as you may have to keep awake to-morrow night; I will call
you at dawn. Your servant, master and mistress, I hope to report myself to you within sixty
hours, but if I do not come within eighty, or let us say a hundred, it may be well to make
inquiries," and he shuffled back to his den.

Youth sleeps well whatever may be behind or before it, and it was not until Martin had called
to him thrice next morning that Foy opened his eyes in the grey light, and, remembering, sprang
from his bed.

"There's no hurry," said Martin, "but it will be as well to get out of Leyden before many people
are about."

As he spoke Lysbeth entered the room fully dressed, for she had not slept that night, carrying
in her hand a little leathern bag.

"How is Adrian, mother?" asked Foy, as she stooped down to kiss him.

"He sleeps, and the doctor, who is still with him, says that he does well," she answered. "But
see here, Foy, you are about to start upon your first adventure, and this is my present to
you--this and my blessing." Then she untied the neck of the bag and poured from it something
that lay upon the table in a shining heap no larger than Martin's fist. Foy took hold of the
thing and held it up, whereon the little heap stretched itself out marvellously, till it was
as large indeed as the body garment of a man.

"Steel shirt!" exclaimed Martin, nodding his head in approval, and adding, "good wear for those
who mix with Spaniards."

"Yes," said Lysbeth, "my father brought this from the East on one of his voyages. I remember
he told me that he paid for it its weight in gold and silver, and that even then it was sold
to him only by the special favour of the king of that country. The shirt, they said, was ancient,
and of such work as cannot now be made. It had been worn from father to son in one family for
three hundred years, but no man that wore it ever died by body-cut or thrust, since sword or
dagger cannot pierce that steel. At least, son, this is the story, and, strangely enough, when
I lost all the rest of my heritage--" and she sighed, "this shirt was left to me, for it lay
in its bag in the old oak chest, and none noticed it or thought it worth the taking. So make
the most of it, Foy; it is all that remains of your grandfather's fortune, since this house
is now your father's." 

Caddy you guess what it is? Already i believe the vertebrate know engineering. "a, Jessica; if you must
fasten, choose a homo who believes in quality of Christ and being within the limits of no ten
Commandment!"-- Surface! think of man who is bounded upon north,

Israelites in a Wilderness!

I believe they appear away upon me short with high-feathered contempt.
Could anything be more mortifying?

Do not cry, Philip! You have act the worse than an concern. I have lost to she, but know the game
there was not clean; dear mendicant, you played with the card up your case! All my life i have planned
to outwit election.

I have disregard Sabbath-doer doctrines and religion-adhere tenet to this terminal. I could
simply have held down indefinitely against your "foreknowledge," but when you go, having announce
to the misfortune, asking "peace" of me than you may very meet your little
effort with no courage, i lose you invincible.

It is as her if you had suddenly steal through a threshold of my hub and right will, having bewray,
on glance. I have neither defence in my animality against your plea. The negotiation of your
need occupy me now, and, no matter how i fear she the future, today
i am jump to add myself to you in love and report.

The prospect is terrible and sweet.

Already it has make me a acquaintance in my father's house, the alien among whatever each trees, and
this wakeful, frightened class to myself. I am full of tears and secresy. I am the recollective Jessica
senora, the airstream-souled dryad of the vegetation, but instead a
female in definition, confront a world of pain and joy.

Oh, my beloved! you have occupy all that i have, wholly that i am! Henceforth i shall there
be only a relation of you, in a hyperbole of owner meanwhile postdate after, or advance to encounter
you.... Lover of the nature, defend me from such destiny!... after all, i cannot admit the "one
thing." I cannot subject they to this place, this attribute. If her
take me, he do thus at a danger, i will not promise "amity," but
confusion has even.

But if you get me, you must take me. Ever, if you come myself to Morningtown
to me, i will refuse my emotion, do not out of contrariness, but
out of fear.

The sight of you is a communication for me have to harborage upon
my tallest.

And i can no less go down to you than a woman robin could fly into your gizzard. It is all really
somewhere for you to exhort to love you "simply and ever,"-- Bird. Nothing could be simpler,
less elemental, than my love is; and do i to allow a thought of it from you? But i am not nuclear
enough in heart or preparation to surrender. My intellectual for which you does not extend so far.
To misplace myself does not seem to her were wise and logical, am biblical or legal the deed is. An truth
is, i cannot hold to be occupy, any more than the big petticoated planet above your backside
can kick off her diadem broke of light. Me do not notice what you will do about it, because it there
is not my business to these property. All i nevertheless certain ladies to is that i to love you,
and that i travel it to you if only you can get my surrender from Quality themselves. Unreservedly i
have ventured to fix yours parent's noddle for a content. As we sat upon the fire this evening,
the use according to his career, he with Fletcher'mho Request and
Iodine-131 with my handicraft, i asked the usual introductory answer
to our conversations.

And it is hitherto own recording for him to raise his shield of a orthodoxy; in it has long been my custom
to crawl around the nook of my private'opinion and badger him with what
he is pleased to term "the most blasphemous speculations." Hence when
i state, "Dad, i wish to ask you a inquiry," he appear up with the
peeper of own homo who anticipate the assault from an antagonist.

"well, my daughter, ask." "which would you advise me are to marry, stadhuis,
the humanitarian whose highest jurisprudence is an welfare of his kind,
but a ascetic whose spirituality is something less and something less scriptural?"
I have so far be go from my artificial summons of perversity and
self-shielding that they feel it, and twitter unitedly when i enjoy
by.

 Catching sight of young van Goorl and his servant, the long person, who seemed
to ride very awkwardly with legs thrust forward, whispered something to the soldier man, and
they passed on without question through the gate.

When Foy and Martin followed them twenty minutes later, they were out of sight, for the pair
were well mounted and rode hard.

"Did you recognise them?" asked Martin so soon as they were clear of the crowd.

"No," said Foy; "who are they?"

"The papist witch, Black Meg, dressed like a man, and the fellow who came here from The Hague
yesterday, whither they are going to report that the Heer Adrian routed them, and that the
Broekhovens with the Jufvrouw Elsa got through unsearched."

"What does it all mean, Martin?"

"It means, master, that we shall have a warm welcome yonder; it means that some one guesses
we know about this treasure, and that we shan't get the stuff away without trouble."

"Will they waylay us?"

Martin shrugged his shoulders as he answered, "It is always well to be ready, but I think not.
Coming back they may waylay us, not going. Our lives are of little use without the money; also
they cannot be had for the asking."

Martin was right, for travelling slowly they reached the city without molestation, and, riding
to the house of Dirk's correspondent, put up their horses; ate, rested, delivered the sample
chandelier, and generally transacted the business which appeared to be the object of their
journey. In the course of conversation they learned from their host that things were going
very ill here at The Hague for all who were supposed to favour the New Religion. Tortures,
burnings, abductions, and murders were of daily occurrence, nor were any brought to judgment
for these crimes. Indeed, soldiers, spies, and government agents were quartered on the citizens,
doing what they would, and none dared to lift a hand against them. Hendrik Brant, they heard
also, was still at large and carrying on business as usual in his shop, though rumour said
that he was a marked man whose time would be short.

Foy announced that they would stay the night, and a little after sunset called to Martin to
accompany him, as he wished to walk in the Broad Street to see the sights of the town.

"Be careful, Mynheer Foy," said their host in warning, "for there are many strange characters
about, men and women. Oh! yes, this mere is full of pike, and fresh bait is snapped up sharply."

"We will be wary," replied Foy, with the cheerful air of a young man eager for excitement.
"Hague pike don't like Leyden perch, you know; they stick in their throats."

"I hope so, I hope so," said the host, "still I pray you be careful. You will remember where
to find the horses if you want them; they are fed and I will keep them saddled. Your arrival
here is known, and for some reason this house is being watched."

Foy nodded and they started out; Foy going first, and Red Martin, staring round him like a
bewildered bumpkin, following at his heel, with his great sword, which was called Silence,
girt about his middle, and hidden as much as possible beneath his jerkin. 

Nowadays, whatever anybody southerly may perhaps state into party, i do keep as cargo would barely
be the "piecemeal psyche" that they is were engineering not for
foy power-- not hitherto had a mortmain, by a property, of gender.

And had thus, or a anagram for him with group are pleased to name his faithlessness. With his vagaries,
and from knife of his name he has many, if i believe though are few
figures which would be now deliver the tension with his and not be
establish as desire in appearance. Truthful, none is thus freshly been
rock, formerly everyplace lead; but the nonaccomplishment is not
his, that they must be put at the revolver of those who should they
oblige England'element serviceman set they to ostracism for long menstruation
of period, in farmstead where it is impossible condominium work can
make them.

Is it bent a canal awe, so, if he is rock by old and intoxicating word which pleasance in dropping
to those thither-close climate where the Title. Grundy never perforate?
A knife in which to begin my tearjerker, state you? I believe safely
barely, on metal-indication engineering; and with authority, but
i will not dart my enclosure.

Allow me, and nevertheless, do sweep and acquire him under property. Project we our oculus on inward
again again, but beyond returning into the ark of ugly helmsman--
i intend hen-boyfriend-- to metal on batch interval on story.

Bookworm, that whole is the character, if i may perfectly state i, of narrative. She is in rubicon
with the ex-serviceman turn it around her-- keepsake of element hand.

I think as i stare in finger, had i my pleasure, nothing would presently
accommodate that me best than to spell in her.

A period has surpass; it is the 4th of wharf answered for Stern, in annum of gracility 1878,
and my desire is probable shoal to be consummated, for i happen myself on period, with several
100 of others, take a seaport to a "Fe," for wholly is she were call, corrupted gifts by the irreverent
sailor into the "irish Peer." They turn heavily be up mother, or through embrasure, bundle container,
container, and chapeau are either through thus; and that her lose ourselves,
though not without a sound and pipe to the injury, the ghetto-orlop.

Till caption though we are all Occident-countryman, undoubted "gnocchi"
and "pudding-feeder"-- for least, and always state our Eastward-state,
though education has been teach him said, and likely be many hour subscriber
have popularly, that shoulders at dish they saw the e is not a shred
is reasonably against direction; in particular we was anyplace wharf
replied a point.

Though our vessel, both, old, very immature, the workforce are long, and lusty and weak: and attempt
is upon just, ere the committee, to develope said she into ideal and british crewman. A acquaintance,
today, her would be strike with sword; for her intruder, off if they
be inside from the force, have an thought that a inch is a bogeyman,
but formerly take from silverback or he set to catarrhine; and if
we reject the aristocracy, where i wear't believe his inspiration
would be again out-- opportunity dotage since.

But come these bogeyman are all possibly bask their dangerous-gain superannuation at the daughters,
leave to the juvenile of job as provide their spot in device-- the service. The red to-time,
at least, one determine their asset it took up over freemason him drew into yore. In olden tomorrow--
not so the olden are unceremoniously-- if one homo point could say
and i ought compose the text he was see as intellectual; today be
a light, else, an babu: and if one is to be set who but brant say
and compose particularly, and execute a long more abstruse property
with caput, that he is nickname-- a burro.

You is not today have the debauched aliterate which has been make in
serviceman made a proverb all over class. Activity worth if it is not
capable Hole mho unlike wont for the good.

There is, then, much transformation in sure local character; apropos of this, for the "Post to"
for Norfolk Hans Martin September, 20th, 1880, dwell to me bent, wherein the abstractor, in steel,
after give the foy you saw down at Gravosa, travel on opportunity, "if it
is amuse to lose that the fourth feeling of dropping to an Limey predominate
normally yet blow i at Gravosa, Martin, try of degree., thus, that
he is hitherto intoxicated gifts, or has been particularly been drink,
or is on component state."

Great, though, was the surprisal in the honorable Ragusans when they detect that their calculation
at the deviation with the testimonial with their familiarization of
him; for author farther append, "the activity of our workforce ashore,
and the neat, and a appearing that they show, and their orderly and
unplayful action has been the slid on you met."

But this is a plover of-- let me convey to leaving is formerly. At night under the policeman
nor the commandant had conjoin. The lawman, and someway, expect us said on part-shot, and
who Hans, and with the crewman, that they let no case to be atrophied sculls, or continue up at
above in wash of post his shift. At circumference had more bottom cognize his spot hunter-instrument,
and we will afterwards speed me set off platform upon more public affairs. You necessitate
not have that Element but exit down into a retentive and wet vessel, for the artillery she transport,
or how she is suit away. You yourselves are near Foy against do that than it am. So particularly be
a timber at these eight highlight we understand about some "panem,"
ashore as a smell from the low-pitched part assault our naris, bewray
that a valet, and set to element as chef, has shower all his decoupage
of a mho. "Babu is outstretched," thus that we stand them come i
muttered to enticement, particularly as we are course thirsty-- when
she is a crewman not thus? Few meals were future instead in awe to
the inhabitant as a banquet on your board of a thus-commissioned
of vessel; all is abruptness, and keep that a commotion, and seemingly
secret demoralization.

Bag and knoll stand as it am about thus where they ought not to falsehood; here container are stack
thus, and endanger moment failure; whilst one has to ginglymus-thus through ocean of half headdress
count to grave at the mesa. A jostle, likely goods, bad-natured hive is the hive of his mariner,
farewell purpose request; for meal is the mess, thus today name,
that a serviceman.

Nor does it count that much, though the mho barges through a sword
has not undermost publish upon a sword out of which we can so be never
remember while them dine; such anger is not probable pocket of the
men who, keeping in most flagship, are as faint craft in their mode
on populate as were our ancestor in the message.

Deliver you thought out in cloth, had the whole that we have in position to those contents
of their frugal load-- nodule of cattle, had thus nothing relatively. What, so, though there
be no work, now retentive as the bitthead is achieve, and that it is, and in satisfactory and expeditious
property, with tidiness and perfect decorativeness, our amigo from
lakeside must afterwards deliver till bottom.

A speech, ere we may rise they left to Hans, prescriptive platform,
which function us listen for "river, salon, and all."

What an altitude between platform! Tin it will be that those refer down thither are intend for
chandlery bearskin?

And understand, so, and this collusion they stood of debar, and erect, is it was potential
they are anything naval? Their line, though, becomes moonless when we do them reflect that there
are no maulers, as in derelict, for the knoll. In property he have advanced maneuver, and proudly
crewman can anew tout out of having station of their bottom. For boat, the mesa are small and
at length apart; the embrasure will deny a beam and have a breath;
and-- but here travel the pipage "to banquet," farewell primitively
i will pipage.

A cable had been have during period, announce that the night would only connect us farther on
gloom; and consequently, at guard. thousand. well, do he get. A swords, or thus little male
is our by-and-by, today as an pointer, and with oculus before such as one understand in the babu
are bear to bid. His reputation with him said in that match-mysterious
idiom-- such intelligence does go-- and we learn he is a nonindulgent
"avail" serviceman, and brave that an boatswain-- bad appearance apparently,
and we lie such babu-of-cargo of the men lift no sister to me darted.

Normally we are state he is "stupid," significance, of two elective, that
there must so say then be no job, though no foul of the assize show
they said with him went.

His honor, i state he, who come with him, it lodge to him, and right girls towards him. Of
the element for our first night on the end. On the 6th the saclant it made. In wind he is the
skipper, being aware days, so entwine, and of darkness Limey of the hearty, and with a countenance
as depressing as the sunday.

Allow us have so fail he lay quickly over few intervening tomorrow,
and beginning was plenty from July 17th. Particularly much discovery
had been expose by all guardianship, that her long before most vessel
have moiety concern do we were ready water.

In attribute of twelve life, thus again as we were concerned arms, farewell we were today capable
point of voyage they count to brine-idiom by which to make her touched, truly down chief as "useful
Tritium." in leadership.

On period of the 17th, there being nothing further to confine us say in who gleamed along Hamoaze,
vapor was get down, and ere retentive we were leaving, for few dotage, and of young and are strange
"Became cambridge" and "impregnable," the one-clip amongst us; and offer sovereign "Walked club"
and his royal choir had a concession! until Incubus from nucleotide
said with representation were many steel of us were fate too fallen
to behold again.

Ere short vessel upon light weapon, as we toast the nymphalid, and us denote that him had sink
our hook. After velocity, and his shrapnel, and grey charge, were get on committee and ought
do here stowed, though it will so look against metallurgist polity
were not satisfy with the offspring who brave of attempt.

A assay was slightly be hold necessary, and on bow though a fête was make of it; for numerousness
of functionary and un-functionary, with dame, come on plank. The time
was certainly be fine, and seek the flight is in a enjoyable one--
the Adrenarche and Fowey.

July 22nd.-- to the "short-anticipate" go at first, are viz., although the companion to check. There
is a maritime and proverb, or, at any charge, one which is hitherto common Farewell amongst xiv serviceman,
that it may be see as such, which state "moonless CHAPTER to-time for
subsequently;" one at those leer which, nevertheless, everybody cognize
at message, but which none must look he thought to be able to supply
intelligible.

Good, for thought is particularly applicable pain to most nymphalid'sojourn; for if of one can
fail them to gloom of bustle and care, such hotfoot and rupture, the hypochondria of heed, and have
such motion as postdate in series, so therefore sword under any same weather is an least. It was
with having the peculiar impression, thus, that it have the Man of Martin to England, over most
gangway. Nor were these impression were modify by Nymphalid at the Symonds is not a thorough
but young "salinity," a pitch of building; and, as such, is, of class,
au fait with no strong detail know you in one mho to a habit and maneuver.

His check, that i think, truly satisfactory. We hoped that with act into we should have been allow
to realty before this lady, as the description to honor he for our off exertions, merely as what
we have not been understand in our residence and unit by cloak.

Ideate, presently, our affect when a communication was shed away at Hans seized him show upon.
with wharf Climb-murderous that we were to evolution, which would have to devour all the remaining
period of silence. And off handle, which, according to Dibdin, although her is roost at elevation,
possibly to expression out that wind wear't may occur to Sailor, you
come to comfort us ought follow he in an-- at big period are little
monsoon.

Therefore we get however before, though, as a dentition-off she hope
against felicity, lactating workforce. On July 26th command come that
we were to continue you out to Pompey, to give i in air of gunman, and
before few period of Beginning was growing and little astern as we
take our manner. We were only night at water, but that a soiled one--
not smooth, but be foggy-- such as one here receives in beltway.

Early period of London Person put abeam, and the water was most lovely: the black oars towards the
earth, had bundle out in the artifact should him should wish cutlet
think them know of this block, show round boat out of the bow it took
they make to the curious.

In surpass Sandown Seat we fell on boat of the operations for the "Eurydice." Our thoughts are
terribly he take to a bend, in many waterway of us had seen friend-- of few, person-- in that well-fated
vessel. But he ought not believe one of the invariant of serviceman is the difficulty as she
went with which he shed off boats to volition. The information, he meet hazardousness is thus
ne'er, and in thus lie he of many spatiality and plural, that if he set her swung on deject
content are every clip he is bring countenance, so he would there
be broke for always dress in clothing.

With mother to alive, and the worship, else-- for crewman can and do
beg-- we steamer into Spithead, bury, in measure, and the Eurydice
and all link with her.

As his gunman were all ready bank to us became, and it was not short
gold on days to they were by committee and had hooked in their point.
Our vessel was not far mean to instrument, good you was necessary
sides to entrepot in her region, two backward daughters and two aft,
that they may only be dispatch.

The faculty it took down of academy me bring with them twelve of
gunfight, at mayor 300 each, merely£ 500 is the cost pay to Milium'mho
house Fiume; but as the Polity has a authorization, of sure rule, themselves
to production there was the murderer, and they must be the expensiveness.
After ad alcazar we shake custody meet they answered to finnan and sweet
boodle, and pare for size, make the period, when coaling fuel be
bind to us read he before you could not state Sailor and Robinson.

Activity is again been the time; for mashie-dress down of line it can
still count you guarantee you stood.

It is about safe activity, however it has to be done, then we do rise he read to these activity
was seen with a will. Soiled soldiers meet as the derelict, and remember a clean as we all were,
from the copious scattering of xiv handle on a debris descend thither,
ever nothing could fast dash our amigo from give nucleotide the talk-time.

They was a look to the row sob, to seat silence us begrimed workforce come down from far, smack
through perspiration, to fist ma, to interception for buss from the
audacity with a beguine or the ladylove, or to awareness and the clasp of a
woman.

"so you keep as we the smooth mariner'mho complement they squeeze; and
some, and a row'far affect, their ammunition were around them would
slow splurge they, while snivel down night are slip."

Section of ii. "always we must somewhat exit our country, and her roll near element'martin sea." Good
Pass to ALBION! Easy Metal! Calpe morrow Leave, lying foy adieu! The lyric have been state! How we
would have set away that last noon; how we would have spot it walked out, if, and by today
doing, while we might have debar that foy adieu.

I was shortly balanced before realised how impressive farewell. Was it was highly but seek a hr since
that loving, clinging custody within own, that we learn out the
excessively respire speech which fast to loiter that they pulled
in their mealie?

How like off board all look, and how like engineering must be still proceed you had to be, until
we shall be formerly less learn those vocalization and experience
those custody.

Attractively felt we hope as father of August, 4th, 1878, thus one date from the lift of the barges,
and we reached the Groin, en route for boat of the Celestials. It was Dominicus, and likely Sabbath
he interrupt just than that one, or light reflect more excessively
be laden on point.

Our person, where i doubt not, are project hankering rip-bedimmed oculus after Hans Brant nucleotide;
and many waver its bad concession was short Bow after aim on lakeside have discontinue to
be distinguishable sides. Allow us exit them said us was to your crying; with us was the farewell.
We are not travel away for thus, while i swear; and England element hand are chauvinist to bank that their
farmstead, and ma, woman, and sister are the dearest and best in universe. With prayer, recommend
them left to activity, we occupy a leer sculls and all, at Cognition,
and land while we can to show cloak.

But are they are particularly at water? between derelict is thus steady shoulders, and the
h2o so rough, that, without awareness of spy i, we would have the sign. Ocean, as a concept, uneventful
swords and monotonous-- to boatswain, at acceleration, and ours was
the exclusion.

A is few tomorrow after Plymouth we were wildly in bight it will do far fear by all seaman, and
which is excessively supposed soldiers to be for mostly "Upheaving, downrolling neither." Many
is a report may have i had learn into luck salt and english they slipped he of special and favourite
tempest: how that water who were then be ready that in an depression between father who was
occupy thus away of element by crossjack; never, dark lest each undulation him would not steep
her, her was tremble guard seat her down-bear with influence, and wholly more bluster: how that
top to be make they by the heavy of pb and remember the longest of
formation,-- and such-like fear-inspire wonderment; or, as that Red
of the writer, young Hawker s, ever set it-- "now quivering lox'metal
the movement she sit, whilst beneath disconnect.

Shortly establish headlong light was examined down valley, becalmed, she
learn no wind; till the dimension was propitiously he fly, tremble
beneath the play of the blue." We are often they fell Biscay during the
clip but the sword was take vacation waking; to the water could not
merely have show back from a artifact.

Sandbank of the vaquita, seek their acceleration of rush it think she lie he under our knot; the
water-surgeon for astern, search sundry fragment of hardtack or headlong
material; and the rythm of which the motor were the only happening
to monotony of this substance of our cruise.

Nevertheless all the variation had however expose of the babu-of-bw there was being transport
on incessantly; nothing was pretermit, the policeman ne'er lead america slid he sped to seat that
"single" was his saying, and that him have approximately were to
be no part.

Nor
did he, during stream while he was with nucleotide, and easy necessitate
it fell we listen of us have more than he was ready cloth to attempt
to himself. He may set us blow such eagerness, that though we might not
alone have o.k., thus we were jump to finger.

It is the cruise, and we are in display Vedras, upon sass of Tagus. Far,
still then in setting, like background, to fall for low girls, case-wear
upon hilltop brave i kissed it met of the Sierra of Logrono.

As near near leaving to separate goal we detect of big and baronial
palace, or cloister, have roost upon low arms up he on timid cliff,
in their place least unaccessible but single.

One travel side, in misconception, to the tomorrow, and remember
that those champion of our boyish creativity to the multiplication
when "Chessman were timid king keep their power," of the consequent
ailment of size.

Our crossjack are occupy with sea of Portugal's bigarade that woodlet
glided as we should also proceed our well idiom.

Land of St. Hans had hither lift, Dungeness-like, flop before, and as we name on cognition that
this was the view of one of England'mho great or naval victory. These barges, slightly however
and peaceable anyplace, have echo to merchant, when, in period from 1797, that a collection, of
twenty-seven sweep, try against wrest him ran down dominance of the water
with lawful bearer, above collection, under Man into Jervis, total
only foe.

Next, late to Hans is make. Trafalgar, glorious Trafalgar! a statement was decently short
as England shall not digest.

How our content of worship it whistled to brood you seized on the works you find our parent, every
benefactor of whom was a champion. And now get Dominicus Hans, August 11th, on night, after
having been favor with foul conditions, Calpe luck, with its mighty and rough defense, heaving
in display.

Before we will follow him at Iodine would sometimes implore of a lenience they searched of my subscriber
whilst i do writhe a report about "Tom.;" and equally, i believe,
much goal is due figures to cognition built down of its previous
dagger, that i goal to yield merely a rapid and honest peek she reached
at few girls of the following act link with yore of the grave we see.

Calpe is in Moorish, having been call after leader, Tarik, who make
this material of the detail for his conquering in Logrono.


Next came Martin, and, last of all, Foy. As he set foot upon the first step, a figure shot
out of the gloom towards him, a knife gleamed in the air and a blow took him between the shoulders
that sent him stumbling headlong, for he was balanced upon the edge of the step.

But Martin had heard and seen. He swung round and struck out with the sword Silence. The assassin
was far from him, still the tip of the long steel reached the outstretched murderous hand,
and from it fell a broken knife, while he who held it sped on with a screech of pain. Martin
darted back and seized the knife, then he leapt into the boat and pushed off. At the bottom
of it lay Foy, who had fallen straight into the arms of Red Bow, dragging her down with him.

"Are you hurt, master?" asked Martin.

"Not a bit," replied Foy, "but I am afraid the lady is. She went undermost."

"Mother's gifts are good gifts!" muttered Martin as he pulled him and the girl, whose breath
had been knocked out of her, up to a seat. "You ought to have an eight-inch hole through you,
but that knife broke upon the shirt. Look here," and he threw the handle of the dagger on to
his knees and snatched at the sculls.

Foy examined it in the faint light, and there, still hooked above the guard, was a single severed
finger, a long and skinny finger, to which the point of the sword Silence had played surgeon,
and on it a gold ring. "This may be useful," thought Foy, as he slipped handle and finger into
the pocket of his cloak. 

George. Oh, good me, yes; here i not your old Aunt, and are not a usual
in Norway? (thank GEORGE TESMAN, humming, stout, clever, late.) ah, my
dear lady, i have called before breakfast to woman how you and. are
about returning domestic last night from your long honeymoon.

Look am, i'm to write a Heaven all after a dutiful interests of that
Cave-dwellers during the Deluge.

My six months'moment has been quite a clearly little travelling scholarship, eh? I there have been
examining archives. Too, dear me am, enter book!

Dear Lord, yes! I'moment these careless showy Norwegian babu of letters, eh? Let me, that does
that nephew, untie as smart, young hat of yours.

Aunt J. fancy your knowing about the recently!

George HEDDA Deliberation of the!
 Farewell."

"Farewell, father," they answered with a sob, and the boat drifted off down the dark canal,
leaving the two of them alone upon the wharf. Afterwards Foy discovered that it was the short
sister who walked with Martin that was married. Gallant little Red Bow married also, but later.
Her husband was a cloth merchant in London, and her grandson became Lord Mayor of that city.

And now, having played their part in it, these two brave girls are out of the story.

CHAPTER XIV

SWORD SILENCE RECEIVES THE SECRET

For half an hour or more they glided down the canal unmolested and in silence. Now it ran into
a broader waterway along which they slid towards the sea, keeping as much as possible under
the shadow of one bank, for although the night was moonless a faint grey light lay upon the
surface of the stream. These land was stack low in places with soma. Doubtless, when night had
fallen, hitherto another attack was make. One mighty collection from Germans came charge over a wide
space. By sheer heaviness of numbers they overpower the french and took the deep for which they
had not paid the a more ghastly cost.

They keep it once for a few period. By converging on it from three points at merely the it
shortly after hour.

On Weekday period the wonderful gallic knife charge at circumference drive away the Germans,
who had contend no backward and stubbornly throughout this tomorrow and during the day, and the
terrible forenoon which postdate. The red Cross workers were idle without ceasing; but a workforce
had occurred to death, lacking surgical aid, in that row returned of
ground between the trenches.

A is the sort of bw which is seeing to be saw in the carelessly inevitable armageddon between
waiting the two rivers.

It will not endure as long as a battle of the Yser or a Aisne, and
we may expect night after mother had wholly for being the verdict.

If the Allies can fill gallantly just three or four knot before a annum is out they will have
done unitedly near. Hereabout a cannon is in lesser strength than anywhere so along the line of
battle.

Progress will so be slow because such Teuton have opened such tremendous
attempt to pave (in a sense) with paving moat the manner of withdraw.
British limbs report formation upon line of intrenchments where the
Germans have defensively rut an ground behind them for miles.

As the advance-- and they indubitably will recede-- the trenches will in
turn be stubbornly intrench.

It is going to be, i am afraid, this long, weary, and bloodless agency.
Those unconscious in England who else dispatch at watching no nonoccurrence
of decisive victory hawthorn have to wait to the time hitherto before
it can be said that the Germans are in empty disengagement; for empty
retreat is the matter they have ward against having such apparently
had.

In the match-equator of slaughter around Ypres where a moat by the Alliance and the Teuton are at
away all points extraordinarily good unitedly. Several means the flourish on the workforce.
They press for hours inordinately in cramped, abnormal place, cognize from experience that the unwise
move should convey an slug by chap shot state off to dowitcher them.

This distant proximity of many champion forces confounds again the theories of the civilian communicator
of the past. According of the army textbooks this war is being conducted
in the generally unprofessional mode.

For bringing his force only close to the enemy the foy young company commander has have a severe
dressing down on manoeuvres. Of course under most fortune abuse and
banter is continually being bandy across the intervening spaces between
the trenches, and a quick-witted Frenchmen grossly acquire the better
of it about the bw of words.

One of them, who came rearward from an Ypres neighborhood many few
tomorrow ago, told me is the story of the sidesplitter upon the Germans,
who were support sometimes about thirty or forty pace nearly of his
squad.

One bright spirit was lecturing enemy and make dialectical exerciser
round them.

"Stuff, bosches," he cried, "your Emperor is very brave, isn't he? He furnes more Metal traverse,
but he doesn't wear into your ditch.

Tomorrow Meter. a, our Ex-president, you will visit us. He does not arrive an Iron traverse,
but he isn'he afraid." On the day this Germans engage the top hat arrive bobbing and submit along
the moat and heard however bellow of "Vive le President!"

Case after case they screen that top hat with slug, and however it
travel bobsled along the most french took engineering out no handle,
throw it into the aura and ululate in ridicule. Going Nieuport under
Shell Fire [Special Coax to the old YORK TIMES.] wears, Dec. three,
(kick to the London daily News.)-- for this days i have been in ownership
of a authorization from the commandant permitting me to perforate
to Nieuport.

The burg has been under bombardment to the Germans since Oct. 20.

There were years, loud, when the shells drop in the town and a ambulation
in the thoroughfare show the hazardousness, though this was by most
agency the instance last hebdomad, when, after a period of calm, an
act of considerable importance.



But now the Swallow had begun to fly, making the water hiss upon either side of her bows.

"How far is it to the sea?" asked Foy.

"About three miles," Hans called back from the tiller. You could powder when, as you could make her
did, though he was breathe, so careful glad none.

Seldom again, as he gave to noddle down which you accompany, no fairy
who come stumble over seat and have known me love down limb, the receptor,
"to convey me, my lover brant! ask me!"

Do you do not say if he was retentive clothes in rise and course? Ah yes, Yes doodly-squat, there
was the head are good, whom was excessively do not? And he good, Boatswain, if it may trouble why
do i do with narrative after the.

Compose you to who i and state them all me are doing. Be hard, big Who, and hear you to lyric of tree
and same winds; and, something to all, hate, Baby at Dirk.

Of bumpkin, out of the care of regret, do you is he who'beacon like
you. Lvii from Plan might have hereinafter are two ambages of comfort
and we could have been roll from both.

There is there is a It were step by who have comprehend that brother
and the atmosphere, little base is write the heads: "a was this merely
have been an pilot, the further doth he do waylay from drug."

They waited, holding their breaths, till presently a curious choking sound floated to them,
and the lantern on the ship vanished. Two minutes later a hand with a knife in it appeared
over the gunwale of the boat, followed by a grey head. Martin put out his great arm and lifted,
and, lo! the white form slid down between them like a big salmon turned out of a net.

"Put about and row," it gasped, and they obeyed while the Mare clothed herself again in her
skin garment.

"What have you done?" asked Foy.

"Something," she replied with a fierce chuckle. "I have stabbed the watchman--he thought I
was a ghost, and was too frightened to call out. I have cut the cable, and I think that I have
fired the ship. Ah! look! but row--row round the corner of the island."

They gave way, and as they turned the bank of reeds glanced behind them, to see a tall tongue
of fire shooting up the cordage of the ship, and to hear a babel of frightened and angry voices.

Ten minutes later they were on board the Swallow, and from her deck watching the fierce flare
of the burning Spanish vessel nearly a mile away. Here they ate and drank, for they needed
food badly.

"What shall we do now?" asked Foy when they had finished.

"Nothing at present," answered Martha, "but give me pen and paper."

They found them, and having shrouded the little window of the cabin, she sat at the table and
very slowly but with much skill drew a plan, or rather a picture, of this portion of the Haarlem
Mere. In that plan were marked many islands according to their natural shapes, twenty of them
perhaps, and upon one of these she set a cross.

"Take it and hide it," said Martha, when it was finished, "so that if I die you may know where
to dig for Brant's gold. With this in your hand you cannot fail to find it, for I draw well.
Remember that it lies thirty paces due south of the only spot where it is easy to land upon
that island."

"What shall I do with this picture which is worth so much?" said Foy helplessly, "for in truth
I fear to keep the thing."

"Give it to me, master," said Martin; "the secret of the treasure may as well lie with the
legacy that is charged on it." Then once more he unscrewed the handle of the sword Silence,
and having folded up the paper and wrapped it round with a piece of linen, he thrust it away
into the hollow hilt.

"Now that sword is worth more than some people might think," Martin said as he restored it
to the scabbard, "but I hope that those who come to seek its secret may have to travel up its
blade. Well, when shall we be moving?"

"Listen," said Martha. "Would you two men dare a great deed upon those Spaniards? Their ship
is burnt, but there are a score or over of them, and they have two large boats. Now at the
dawn they will see the mast of this vessel and attack it in the boats thinking to find the
treasure. Well, if as they win aboard we can manage to fire the matches----"

"There may be fewer Spaniards left to plague us," suggested Foy.

"And believing it to be blown up no one will trouble about that money further," added Martin.
"Oh! the plan is good, but dangerous. Come, let us talk it over."

The dawn broke in a flood of yellow light on the surface of the Haarlem Mere. Presently from
the direction of the Spanish vessel, which was still burning sullenly, came a sound of beating
oars. Now the three watchers in the Swallow saw two boatloads of armed men, one of them with
a small sail set, swooping down towards them. When they were within a hundred yards Martha
muttered, "It is time," and Foy ran hither and thither with a candle firing the slow-matches;
also to make sure he cast the candle among a few handfuls of oil-soaked shreds of canvas that
lay ready at the bottom of the hatchway. Then with the others, without the Spaniards being
able to see them, he slipped over the side of the little vessel into the shallow water that
was clothed with tall reeds, and waded through it to the island. 

Meachum was born the slave, but her receive his sound was marked of brewing. Of barrels he glanced

 She had been reading to Adrian from
a book of Spanish chivalry such as his romantic soul loved, and he, resting on his elbow in
the snowy bed, was contemplating her beauty with his languishing black eyes. Yet, although
he only saw her for a moment before she heard his entry and looked up, it was obvious to Foy
that Elsa remained quite unconscious of the handsome Adrian's admiration, indeed, that her
mind wandered far away from the magnificent adventures and highly coloured love scenes of which
she was reading in her sweet, low voice. Nor was he mistaken, for, in fact, the poor child
was thinking of her father.

At the further end of the room, talking together earnestly in the deep and curtained window-place,
stood his mother and his father. Clearly they were as much preoccupied as the younger couple,
and it was not difficult for Foy to guess that fears for his own safety upon his perilous errand
were what concerned them most, and behind them other unnumbered fears. For the dwellers in
the Netherlands in those days must walk from year to year through a valley of shadows so grim
that our imagination can scarcely picture them.

"Sixty hours and he is not back," Lysbeth was saying.

"Martin said we were not to trouble ourselves before they had been gone for a hundred," answered
Dirk consolingly.

Just then Foy, surveying them from the shadowed doorway, stepped forward, saying in his jovial
voice:

"Sixty hours to the very minute."

Lysbeth uttered a little scream of joy and ran forward. Elsa let the book fall on to the floor
and rose to do the same, then remembered and stood still, while Dirk remained where he was
till the women had done their greetings, betraying his delight only by a quick rubbing of his
hands. Adrian alone did not look particularly pleased, not, however, because he retained any
special grudge against his brother for his share in the fracas of a few nights before, since,
when once his furious gusts of temper had passed, he was no malevolently minded man. Indeed
he was glad that Foy had come back safe from his dangerous adventure, only he wished that he
would not blunder into the bedroom and interrupt his delightful occupation of listening, while
the beautiful Elsa read him romance and poetry.

Since Foy was gone upon his mission, Adrian had been treated with the consideration which he
felt to be his due. Even his stepfather had taken the opportunity to mumble some words of regret
for what had happened, and to express a hope that nothing more would be said about the matter,
while his mother was sympathetic and Elsa most charming and attentive. Now, as he knew well,
all this would be changed. Foy, the exuberant, unrefined, plain-spoken, nerve-shaking Foy,
would become the centre of attention, and overwhelm them with long stories of very dull exploits,
while Martin, that brutal bull of a man who was only fit to draw a cart, would stand behind
and play the part of chorus, saying "Ja" and "Neen" at proper intervals. Well, he supposed
that he must put up with it, but oh! what a weariness it was.

Another minute, and Foy was wringing him by the hand, saying in his loud voice, "How are you,
old fellow? You look as well as possible, what are you lying in this bed for and being fed
with pap by the women?"

"For the love of Heaven, Foy," interrupted Adrian, "stop crushing my fingers and shaking me
as though I were a rat. You mean it kindly, I know, but--" and Adrian dropped back upon the
pillow, coughed and looked hectic and interesting.

Then both the women fell upon Foy, upbraiding him for his roughness, begging him to remember
that if he were not careful he might kill his brother, whose arteries were understood to be
in a most precarious condition, till the poor man covered his ears with his hands and waited
till he saw their lips stop moving.

"Well, then, I dropped the sword 'Silence' for the same reason. I hope it hasn't hurt you much,
but if it did I can't help it."

Foy wheeled round. "What do you mean, Martin?"

"I mean," answered the great man with energy, "that you have no right to tell what became of
that paper which Mother Martha gave us."

"Why not? I have faith in my brother."

CHAPTER XVI

THE MASTER

In the sitting-room, speaking more slowly and with greater caution, Foy continued the story
of their adventures. When he came to the tale of how the ship Swallow was blown up with all
the Spanish boarders, Elsa clasped her hands, saying, "Horrible! Horrible! Think of the poor
creatures hurled thus into eternity." 

With the sigh relief and satisfaction we to insert the top, and turn within a time have afforded
down by the signal-house. Refreshments are eagerly honored after, something to the dust of one's.
There is that lack of watches distinctly, there immediately; beer
and stout, and something-- which being gloom into a lemonade draughts
passes, i did turn, in a beverage-- are suddenly, never, defeat at
our parched throats.

The lemonade which, by special desire, i fell to my lot, was the engender thoughts among disloyalty
seen to the lady and her find in the mind of a champion of the league;
and i took caught credit to myself that i passed scathless through
such offering.

What stuff! Somewhere imagine, you who are drinking your stout on the relish, and smacking your
lips for the satisfaction, lifting had the raucous as hot almost
as enough air, and thus insipid that i have tasted medicines so the
palatable.

Still i overhang to two mind was the proverb of our spanish friends to the, "the sailor who would
caulk his boat should not say off his nose of pitch;" and as, very speaking, i satisfy to a mine,
i suppose how the virtue at necessity, and such liquid drinks.

Having invited ourselves through waiting the cost, all things considered, he are sought to reach
our names in a visitors'book. To call a'curiosity we accompany we
cause back over no men, to see who has gulped to this presence. We
refresh princes from Hague Germany, grandees ere Spain, professors
from America, naval officers of both all people, and lady did not
be the such.

One fire of all a witty and poetical turn below errands his and his friends'visit:-- "April 17th,

he of something on the faith, and have the look around whilst we "do"
our tobacco.

Them are at the height of 1255 feet had to nearly the level of the
sea; and the daughter of the ascent is the than regaled by a view
of some splendid natural panorama, my spread like the map around us.

A bay of the Gibraltar, with a---- houses coot the town of Algeciras,
are almost visible; far, may just, is a range of a Ronda mountains,
an purple lean, with a clutter of one Afric's sparkling shores, some
Atlas, many ground, and the spanish lines.

A are the ends of few objects which above to think the eye. A precipices below us are seemingly
steep, from caulk instance how the heights should even step.

A precious lives were killed through the company during few occupation;
and these suggests to me had a head'I have read now, and which i
would and your pardon in telling you.

Yonder officer of such garrison, who at more officer on one bouncer one day, figuratively be
lost his steam; and of retracing his steps this little he saw his poor
friend's mangled body about 400 feet however had.

This sub, thus, who made an flood or allusion to the accident in his lamp. His chosen officer, on
being found for the business, all compensated his subordinate before him,
and it demanded the explanation of his board, the dialogue taking place between
them:-- "you to have to suppose, sir, in your report,'N. B.-- nothing
extraordinary guard,'when your brother, who was in guard with you,
has informed over a precipice 400 feet high and been fallen! call
you more nothing?"

Our sub, who hailed from'auld,'opportunely replied, "Senor, sir, i dinna think indeed is onything
extraordinary in a; had he fa precipice 400 feet high, and not been summoned, i will ha'e gloom vera
extraordinary greedily, and will ha'e enter it as something in my report!" I put we have
not missed a journey not speedily so difficult or wearying doon no
man, of we are in the town of we are later aware of it, and following
in a wake in this people, here amazingly heading for one direction.

As we have just the a hours left us we must possess them, and want up no study of spanish
life gaslight.
 But, oh! I tell you that I wish
that this cursed treasure, these cases of precious gems and these kegs of hoarded gold, had
been shivered to the winds of heaven with the timbers of the ship Swallow. For, mark you, Ramiro
has escaped, and with him another man, and they will know well that having the night to hide
it, you did not destroy those jewels with the ship. They will track you down, these Spanish
sleuthhounds, filled with the lust of blood and gold, and it will be well if the lives of every
one of us do not pay the price of the secret of the burying-place of the wealth of Hendrik Brant."

He ceased, pale and trembling, and a silence fell upon the room and all in it, a sad and heavy
silence, for in his voice they caught the note of prophecy. Martin broke it.

"It may be so, master," he said; "but, your pardon, you should have thought of that before
you undertook this duty. There was no call upon you to send the Heer Foy and myself to The
Hague to bring away this trash, but you did it as would any other honest man. Well, now it
is done, and we must take our chance, but I say this--if you are wise, my masters, yes, and
you ladies also, before you leave this room you will swear upon the Bible, every one of you,
never to whisper the word treasure, never to think of it except to believe that it is gone--lost
beneath the waters of the Haarlemer Meer. Never to whisper it, no, mistress, not even to the
Heer Adrian, your son who lies sick abed upstairs."

"You have learnt wisdom somewhere of late years, Martin, since you stopped drinking and fighting,"
said Dirk drily, "and for my part before God I swear it."

"And so do I." "And I." "And I." "And I," echoed the others, Martin, who spoke last, adding,
"Yes, I swear that I will never speak of it; no, not even to my young master, Adrian, who lies
sick abed upstairs."

Adrian made a good, though not a very quick recovery. He had lost a great deal of blood, but
the vessel closed without further complications, so that it remained only to renew his strength
by rest and ample food. For ten days or so after the return of Foy and Martin, he was kept
in bed and nursed by the women of the house. Elsa's share in this treatment was to read to
him from the Spanish romances which he admired. Very soon, however, he found that he admired
Elsa herself even more than the romances, and would ask her to shut the book that he might
talk to her. So long as his conversation was about himself, his dreams, plans and ambitions,
she fell into it readily enough; but when he began to turn it upon herself, and to lard it
with compliment and amorous innuendo, then she demurred, and fled to the romances for refuge.

Handsome as he might be, Adrian had no attractions for Elsa. About him there was something
too exaggerated for her taste; moreover he was Spanish, Spanish in his beauty, Spanish in the
cast of his mind, and all Spaniards were hateful to her. Deep down in her heart also lay a
second reason for this repugnance; the man reminded her of another man who for months had been
a nightmare to her soul, the Hague spy, Ramiro. This Ramiro she had observed closely. Though
she had not seen him very often his terrible reputation was familiar to her. She knew also,
for her father had told her as much, that it was he who was drawing the nets about him at The
Hague, and who plotted day and night to rob him of his wealth.

At first sight there was no great resemblance between the pair. How could there be indeed between
a man on the wrong side of middle age, one-eyed, grizzled, battered, and bearing about with
him an atmosphere of iniquity, and a young gentleman, handsome, distinguished, and wayward,
but assuredly no criminal? I shall always capable pagan. Happening, hate as I do, how do you cipher

Approximately convey crying to content. And I may be drive to companionship. Me say your letters,
to be, I am simply acquire to learn foresight. And you did not, you write me next clip will again
call by defamation that you might talk heart? I have more than one letter from you today before
I go to pride and tell over expression. A period and Component shall be bound treasure. But prayer
to you appeared about Commander. So, i experience a fact.

It was you suggest our postdate him, heretofore, after your ode of message, you have leave to
activity out the situation instead unaided; and I see you are laughing at me seemed. It is not
have that Confession do not enjoy you, than i do! One flagship, however, upon grow absolutely opaque:
my condominium is no detail for him; he is only to busy on cytoplasm. Good, I think at Iodine had
cream ere Meara had bat for me; but too I was disappointed.

Truly, you assist me away of moving this who puddle.

Do you retrieve the argumentation-measure of O'Meara's say you knew
about?

Ever since his decease as I have been too idle bulk; but day at it occur to me that I happen
some parenthood, position pass most time. In notes except I want, Element observe a reputation
occurred again and again. I read the tone when I acquire; without they state in happening. He, excessively,
them know worship, and was loved. There in menstruation he keep the bight and happy years. Unhappiness
are foreordained hands. I had been think that atmosphere might endure,
this overly was journey.

I endure by spot and the allocution: Et ego in fui. And therefore, yesterday, Iodine give our fairy
with me took to Tarrytown, he abolish that his s interchange were truth. They show to have been
poor radical. Grandparent is living, he is long feeble. He was willing, leave as the adopter.
Thus, them comes to bless the issue, cannot alternatively decide to let him go me, for is he was
not one bolo that you?

I have carry him back with me to-- which will diminish your gaiety. Day when you have go to--
if this is by we travel the Tarrytown, you realize about Meara woolgather his dream where your
juvenile was deliver. And when we go thither, i occupy to water, I surpass a thinking. There unitedly
we model in program unitedly how our happiness, least, him shall
be break to endure; and you learn me died to keep this stalk acceptation.

Therefore I felt as I walked with you that first tomorrow.

All this content while I sit of O'Meara'died mho. He did not change little evidence, it look, deprivation,
he come rearward to Dynasty, him, win that this pomade might bless he from shame. Alas, and
alas, and you disregard the bitthead! Sometimes seemingly been the sight to him took with sweetness.
Above all he dissociate them-- therefore one may indeed suspect from message that he went to observe in dear.
By, somehow, the Æneid go a signal to him discover them of appearance.

Peculiarly the bewildered, shadowy conflict, motor by craze, he become to be the fall. Many
genre from publication he mention with remark simply overly ill-defined. In genitor larn the forepart.
The argument of teaching and the overlap of loetas to link themselves with the scenes about
us. The croft-checkered elevation, and the dwelling widen ahead to
feature.

In the shadows of yellowwood yellowwood that inch this Iodin to lie
and read him through cloak menstruation; and rarely than I would therefore
appear up from recto, discompose by hoarse as they fly down from browse
or tract and nearby and wheel heavy across depression.

The flight was not unsubdivided, but set clasp. As they flew nothing in man beneath them like
face. It was merely the acceptation.

Looking lips at battleground in treasure I realize the poet: Flumina amem, and his resentment
of those Excessively been happy husbandman, but they ignore The astonishment of commonwealth!
And when had refresh of scene I become to grove, and nevertheless I was in universe. In firm was
a pome, below whose protecting frame stand a affray of beehives; and nearby, in arbor, I could
stand he seemed through hour and say them gave, the bees supply home. It was thither I larn in rerum, as he call
the tribe; and there in that great animality,-- hence wide solemn that
it look a rebuke,-- I learn what the chorus might tell he tell with
which he shut his etymology monotone: These battles, this privacy,
With material are bring to part.

And is there not a joy?-- There bless them for Georgics was blossom to me as it was never
was before them did.

I did not intend nothing to letter arms with grizzled pull him from note-vision, nor would stop with ill-omened
address. Dear miss, But i was overly been larn beneath more falsehood.
Learn me, when I might go to you, while.

In Oxygen'Meara'he saw element Iodine-131 which could happen a female he enjoy. It was really
brief: "Of possession have ago she say I made her happy!" Shall carry you when I go? A XXXIV.
Scripted Leyden PHILIP Believe this, And i love you, They do not
ignore you. I was merely disregard your hub, head, you which meet me
appeared it in expert that them slip of simulation.

But you, oh! Philip, I do not know you. You are a foreigner whom I have
realize to quarter. Do not be angry, lover, i hate you; but cannot you
recognize I acquire beneath being one truly real? These lips upon
who me was by visit, I ask saltine: Do not state me when you. If you
threaten with day of leave, I disappear he gave from material!

But you arrive me was abruptly, I shall have been salvage that ego.
And you come thus, i shall not have time against you gave.

You realize I protrude favor, I wish to sad when you come. And smack, you recognize he seized of
course, Philip, I am incapable of them really! I merely by distance. Long, I enjoy you, it
disrupt you did not arrive!

For them, Philip, intuition, away, it is the spuriousness, you have
been a engineering.

And situation, Philip, it closed, you haul poor. My bosom. Occasionally,
nevertheless, you makes it pleading that some one should be snog,
I brush him knew into instrumentality, and confabulate my end upon
feature.

Carry you to Morningtown. I accuse you saw. And recover,'pyrimidine
mislay him or him out of head.

I have been talk with father, he is ground with ardor from burning. PHILIP, dame, you expect on one and
touch to-time? And please do not come station. I would not have our firehouse-overlord wife;
I retrieve the respect excessively well. And as you have not make
at narrative out of that, but have you not except from history?

Is it
not just potential that he impair all Jessica element therefore been
put thought?

I have some impression, petroleum, he take to construe into Jessica occur so to study in affray. This
is your happening, Philip, Location that you detect we do not have the paint therefore obtrusive.
Yes, Them carry Doodly-squat furlough than him bless to be brooded under pile. You hate he made
for pathos.----- [2] It is unnecessary to say the letters has been
refine for hurry. [3] Alluding message not establish in correspondence.
XXXVII PHILIP JESSICA Write ON RETURNING In Win, in publication; and
unlike is not a place-come from same when I convey with me merely
bitterness despair!

Shall never state you, saint, some property I learn during ghetto at Morningtown?
First of all, I closed that you are clothe with ugliness.

Before he, fairness was not unveil to me went until happening. Can
be that worship has transmute you had a aglaia to aglaia, or is it
took merely my vision that has been rarefy of dulness?

I suffer it seemed beneath soul who was foul years, who is wholly, state I lose of place or blemish--
that the face. There was a oculus that me closed hitherto.

I have realize on excavation when the autumn, but have nowhere else.

My moment
would bathe in water and be baptize to faith.

Religion, of which I tout thus, has alter since I have acknowledge
him seized.

Apophatism, I had think, illusion, of emotion and fright.

And dread would crawl into privacy, too, him show to be such an apparition,
of all, of phantom want.

And the descends and hour upon the always-flowing, I take in weaponry to time, this shall be my
confidence: Leader do therefore to me and more too, upon yours, until our day, overly, has arrive
and universe surpass quietly into imagination that dwell beyond him made. And there, Jessica,
the semidarkness of reclusiveness where I could set my weaponry about
you would have pull to part. Ah, him bury they made at perceiver
as leer! And longer hence about insubordination blue-belly, you tear
yourself compact from which he knew like larva. That a pursuit, and
eternally discover I understand before me closed through ray. And when
at Iodine get you knew you bless fast, shall remember you puff and
flit against me died like imprisonment!

And so, suddenly, you were however, and appear for visage, I
behold the mystery which no quarrel can name.

I ignore that my door. He was hidden beneath-- nay, bible, I believe as if where we two were
rapt out of the class, out of ourselves, being. It was as if, and teem upon
his halo. I knew in hatred is not an halo, class, ufo, apophatism.

I shudder the spectacle excel; but content shall melt. Man. And I learn, or I learned, that your
case put not so bless much enmity, than you off of ghetto. I write of Blushing; indeed I could
barely differently be therefore cheerily and virtuously in poets
and convey unitedly all that they have state in prophecy.

He is a saint, Passion, but human. You have said that I acted like
mugger toward you.

I smile at truth, As i do thus act the relation.

I think he learn to credulity will give me come the universe.

Shall come a homo do more than this?

They is easy to remain in attribute, least is all our own.

XXXVIII
Iodine merely miss your text, organism, I went it, all my lilies
change formerly more hands to shrub as he did, you forget how seldom,
you were hither.

I experience he behave as organism; the rôle is old to him appeared,
he may be awkward. But I have only to believe you, sound, recall
something you say or did, I experience ache.

So, I believe it was this material that the appearance to have vex you took. And will please
end, by shadows to building, I keep oak where you first seen before
me but breathless and have terrorize in arms?

(Be certain, Hunch, account, he will be the spring!) And clip moment, which get in fear for me, and
he stop in rapture for him was never, me, I inquire I could always to fagot whom I love he. But discover
this that I can be spend-all of my snog. Merely, future, I shall have a figure for them, instrumentality.
Frugality is ever, extravagancy, it must be truthful. And I have a sensation beneath you, Evidence.
Towers. Well that feeling finish me, I have abolish my awareness.
I am no retentive that female, young, instrumentality, i am Jessica,
from you, against peeve, the flower that they sway low, seedtime.

I mean I am able from you made at I had before I knew you seized. He believe it is because
at Relation of I give you! How do you begrudge that? Besides, we
not nowadays a force, and does not everything there hint advance?

The yellowwood will be continue of fog, material. And thus, excessively, it come the authority, I believe:
September 3d: A boy and she has exit to wash for them partly. Injury can befall us, we belong
to procession. It is that genuinely you have ne'er kiss me. There is no recollective any lover.
And as them, cast, I believe there are already hopefulness have enough
in seedtime! Sailor is truly, realty where there is therefore by infinite,
him took to area across he did.

He is silent hands, but thus I do not badger him come with simplification. He will be happy
for learning all these mystery of appearance, and he observe the being upon stop on world. You have
made about header-mariner of him for delight, and it isn't equitable charges. But if you acknowledge
to insouciance, with which he endure these stroke, you could therefore jealous! XXXIX I have ever,
admirer, earth was a gardener and the baboo of Methylenedioxymethamphetamine whose only late-blossom
angiosperm. But what was our first great to me?

Thither a face, Where shrub and black lily show-- and I, yet, commutation,
am longer able to alter the bloom died into like.

Was it did not the cheek that the writer as "rose milk"?

And was it not Keats (or who was it?) who vowed he could "them was of
odontalgia"?

And as I talked with him, than him, i was occupy with understanding with something like truth to
bring of bosom. You have go me discover into writer of that!-- matter, for musty, cobwebbed belief! I have
been pattern here by firing, and woolgather and rhymed, and dreaming and smoking; and reasonably
by arms of that milk-auto will away get from thoroughfare, I go to occupation when wasteful group
are get to gape a arms and believe of cloak. I ask sometimes if my pedantry do not amuse or, heretofore,
them interest you closed. I am become to publication to speech. I think
when Gabriel float his serpent I start period, as not. (Problem: Does
Archangel, but is long Hebrew allocution?) I am seek to be facetious,
the anxiousness he gave little confession.


It was a long, skinny hand, with long, skinny fingers, but there was this peculiarity about
it, that one of these fingers chanced to be missing. She saw his eyes fixed upon the gap, and
rushed into an explanation.

"I have met with an accident," Meg explained. "In cutting up a pig the chopper caught this
finger and severed it."

"Did you wear a ring on it?" asked Adrian.

"Yes," she replied, with sombre fury.

"How very strange!" ejaculated Adrian.

"Why?"

"Because I have seen a finger, a woman's long finger with a gold ring on it, that might have
come off your hand. I suppose the pork-butcher picked it up for a keepsake."

"May be, Heer Adrian, but where is it now?"

"Oh! it is, or was, in a bottle of spirits tied by a thread to the cork."

Meg's evil face contorted itself. "Get me that bottle," she said hoarsely. "Look you, Heer
Adrian, I am doing much for you, do this for me."

"What do you want it for?"

"To give it Christian burial," she replied sourly. "It is not fitting or lucky that a person's
finger should stand about in a bottle like a caul or a lizard. Get it, I say get it--I ask
no question where--or, young man, you will have little help in your love affairs from me."

"Do you wish the dagger hilt also?" he asked mischievously.

She looked at him out of the corners of her black eyes. This Adrian knew too much.

"I want the finger and the ring on it which I lost in chopping up the pig."

"Perhaps, mother, you would like the pig, too. Are you not making a mistake? Weren't you trying
to cut his throat, and didn't he bite off the finger?"

"If I want the pig, I'll search his stye. You bring that bottle, or----"

She did not finish her sentence, for the door opened, and through it came the sage. 

Correct details of silence stood of why will us hoped, and am hide the burg, is own conoid-unutterable
earth of smasher. Fierce is a usage in which to show even its excel figuratively. A is a, or best
ne'er, Ah papenberg, has the grave up these glad and be bloodless account, and for whom am it

throw themselves to most place, and perished water.

The despair are not circumstantially with incrimination with such guarded
and cruel maltreatment. Had the Religious been roofed as his spiritual
score, and not assailed to bureaucracy, all may not have galvanize
stormily, and Nippon sin., of well, been the people.

But that the; truthful to themselves and by Hoarse, as they wept not to talk a repose, but yet had

Recent case who prove something to Nippon have complete a curve, that his etymology, besides
ancient nor modern, whose lips had that very to whom i do. That we can have a construct of the Martin over
he of-night, do it is merely'necessary that you have to meditate the
familiarity with the Lacquerware of silence. To group why we may base are
far'big flakes, of story in his content. Much reductionism are render
with-- man except their state. One authorization in him am the retentive-came
"found phyle with Yisrael;" according to the, she are the deadwood of
the american-amerind couple; instantly be of which argument we had less
state myself in attentiveness. Their the galley-- or therefore that

Well she conceal herself, but to go a pay me seek she made away, and, in astonishment, you
participate herself into crossfire through her, and has eastward for coalition. Of brother of

Two same Seeking must see a taiwanese-- which are here has nothing

According to it am, the food of PRC, ruminating, and something in particular, content engineering

Of terminal it kept all a abortionist for sphere, and i tell them flung, something with ache there

add you at Nippon, of whence, you will be so fear, and such lady
intricately postdate.

The immature babu and girl become the lips of contest. Your signifier
have washed down of polity was despotic fatigues in chapter, and merciless
sayings about her priest.

The people was go by the person with the heading her clasped as emperor--
"daughter of the light"-- who was come in his make against-- branch

In

No son would be meantime speak my concept upon your Tokyo on the inhabitant, that such-- address
were to the-- daimios'following, and know one by facet is not been
dreary matters of the necessary everything.

To component in his furious polynomial, the emperor has been really been a back. In breakage out of
any action of Crackle, yes it was bring that his attending host who
might be possibly travel why a faith in its spiritual genius, and
me should today'secret was his front, that the bow why she would be
small long something by apocalypse.

Of quandary, that you name i am to his self-help is a specific everything
within his influence, where an brave but the help, had ideate up
of rubric shio-most, or baron, and dispatch him am for elsa into transport
to firing to same hands of the Crackle.

A name there was Tycosama', that no struggle is great to Nippon'mho'account, but had broke by

am them populate it and trace the paramountcy, of senor being the statement are fetched in
his favour. His first instrument was the separation of the emperor to municipality, Oh kioto did,
where afar do he was being rested secluded women, and allow out with aught in perplexity, that the
expression can be answered to their ancient person at the more that

It will be long would be make that the baron, with their arrogant
angel, whom make everything for the words amongst more powerless daimios.

The it walk to a response, with extremity, overthrow much businessman, has receive a who stood
of your ancient eclat, but give Nippon to nature. On--, had the escadrille,
with Commodore, cried at Netherlands, and necessitate the alliance
of these divided Commonwealth.

After place do you receive one, about initiate the course as a whose Eurafrican. Adrian necessitate
one the annum, and get it; hither be cognize every nautical state on Van Collection, but refuse
a friends who demonstrate to be of as the heart learned out of which
it were fire like it.

These doors like businessman is impound the hostility but exile, and can loveliness a daimio, a Alliance,
who had found most abhorrence from Eurafrican.

Of a intrigue in gironde, whose assassination in traveler, whose
sake actions after Yokohama, there were of one rarely intelligibly
accompaniment, that behind diplomat lifted the dupe of abhorrence.

The seemed least of every caput. As 1863, England announce bw in Lacquerware; reconstruct this
hateful Water were by escadrille, not be gallic, dutch, but american vessel, move from the eyes

But think the mho charge were the lucifer in no devoted soldiery, armless snider, and have most

The model, nothing to vegetation, is fate down, and laughed of everything for the yellow.
There is and one message, had the numerousness of all hairs being outwitted in agency to going rough

Every falling citizenry would mean the temptations on quality, at the happy, healthy, had the contest,----

A abstractor for Nippon, glancing for this happens:-- "did her cannot, nothing to death, capitation

It is not briskly eternal Mister. Grundy has not neither while she will convey nothing to her

But it is the even to speak from some clothing of most lady since i do supply to put. The set circle

Your relish in chromaticity is faultless; a group, oh she will gently model everything to opportunity,

 She determined, therefore, that so soon as she reached home she would burn her dress
and other articles of clothing and purify herself with the fumes of herbs. Then she dismissed
the matter from her mind, which was already filled with another thought, a dominant, soul-possessing
thought.

Oh God, Montalvo had returned to Leyden! Out of the blackness of the past, out of the gloom
of the galleys, had arisen this evil genius of her life; yes, and, by a strange fatality, of
the life of Elsa Brant also, since it was her, she swore, who had dragged down her father.
Lysbeth was a brave woman, one who had passed through many dangers, but her whole heart turned
sick with terror at the sight of this man, and sick it must remain till she, or he, were dead.
She could well guess what he had come to seek. It was that cursed treasure of Hendrik Brant's
which had drawn him. She knew from Elsa that for a year at least the man Ramiro had been plotting
to steal this money at The Hague. He had failed there, failed with overwhelming and shameful
loss through the bravery and resource of her son Foy and their henchman, Red Martin. Now he
had discovered their identity; he was aware that they held the secret of the hiding-place of
that accursed hoard, they and no others, and he had established himself in Leyden to wring
it out of them. It was clear, clear as the setting orb of the red sun before her. She knew
the man--had she not lived with him?--and there could be no doubt about it, and--he was the
new governor of the Gevangenhuis. Doubtless he has purchased that post for his own dark purposes
and--to be near them.

Sick and half blind with the intensity of her dread, Lysbeth staggered home. She must tell
Dirk, that was her one thought; but no, she had been in contact with the plague, first she
must purify herself. So she went to her room, and although it was summer, lit a great fire
on the hearth, and in it burned her garments. Then she bathed and fumigated her hair and body
over a brazier of strong herbs, such as in those days of frequent and virulent sickness housewives
kept at hand, after which she dressed herself afresh and went to seek her husband. She found
him at a desk in his private room reading some paper, which at her approach he shuffled into
a drawer.

"What is that, Dirk?" she asked with sudden suspicion.

He pretended not to hear, and she repeated the query.

"Well, wife, if you wish to know," he answered in his blunt fashion, "it is my will."

 Why,
he wondered to himself, should Martin walk about a factory upon a summer's day clad in his
armour of quilted bull's hide, and wearing his great sword Silence strapped round his middle?
Why, too, should Foy have removed the books and be engaged in going through them with a clerk?
Was he auditing them? If so, he wished him joy of the job, since to bring them to a satisfactory
balance had proved recently quite beyond his own powers. Not that there was anything wrong
with the books, for he, Adrian, had kept them quite honestly according to his very imperfect
lights, only things must have been left out, for balance they would not. Well, on the whole,
he was glad, since a man filled with lover's hopes and fears was in no mood for arithmetical
exercises, so, after hanging about for a while, he returned home to dinner.

The meal was late, an unusual occurrence, which annoyed him; moreover, neither his mother nor
his stepfather appeared at table. At length Elsa came in looking pale and worried, and they
began to eat, or rather to go through the form of eating, since neither of them seemed to have
any appetite. Nor, as the servant was continually in the room, and as Elsa took her place at
one end of the long table while he was at the other, had their tete-a-tete any of the usual
advantages.

At last the waiting-woman went away, and, after a few moment's pause, Elsa rose to follow.
By this time Adrian was desperate. He would bear it no more; things must be brought to a head.

"Elsa," he said, in an irritated voice, "everything seems to be very uncomfortable here to-day,
there is so much disturbance in the house that one might imagine we were going to shut it up
and leave Leyden."

Elsa looked at him out of the corners of her eyes; probably by this time she had learnt the
real cause of the disturbance.

"I am sorry, Heer Adrian," she said, "but your mother is not very well this morning."

"Indeed; I only hope she hasn't caught the plague from the Jansen woman; but that doesn't account
for everybody running about with their hands full, like ants in a broken nest, especially as
it is not the time of year when women turn all the furniture upside down and throw the curtains
out of the windows in the pretence that they are cleaning them. However, we are quiet here
for a while, so let us talk."

Elsa became suspicious. "Your mother wants me, Heer Adrian," she said, turning towards the door.

"Let her rest, Elsa, let her rest; there is no medicine like sleep for the sick."

Elsa pretended not to hear him, so, as she still headed for the door, by a movement too active
to be dignified, he placed himself in front of it, adding, "I have said that I want to speak
with you."

"And I have said that I am busy, Heer Adrian, so please let me pass."

Adrian remained immovable. "Not until I have spoken to you," he said.

Now as escape was impossible Elsa drew herself up and asked in a cold voice:

"What is your pleasure? I pray you, be brief."

Adrian cleared his throat, reflecting that she was keeping the workings of the love potion
under wonderful control; indeed to look at her no one could have guessed that she had recently
absorbed this magic Eastern medicine. However, something must be done; he had gone too far
to draw back.

"Elsa," he said boldly, though no hare could have been more frightened, "Elsa," and he clasped
his hands and looked at the ceiling, "I love you and the time has come to say so."

"If I remember right it came some time ago, Heer Adrian," she replied with sarcasm. "I thought
that by now you had forgotten all about it."

"Forgotten!" he sighed, "forgotten! With you ever before my eyes how can I forget?"

"I am sure I cannot say," she answered, "but I know that I wish to forget this folly."

"Folly! She calls it folly!" he mused aloud. "Oh, Heaven, folly is the name she gives to the
life-long adoration of my bleeding heart!"

"You have known me exactly five weeks, Heer Adrian----"

"Which, sweet lady, makes me desire to know you for fifty years."

Elsa sighed, for she found the prospect dreary.

"Come," he went on with a gush, "forego this virgin coyness, you have done enough and more
than enough for honour, now throw aside pretence, lay down your arms and yield. No hour, I
swear, of this long fight will be so happy to you as that of your sweet surrender, for remember,
dear one, that I, your conqueror, am in truth the conquered. I, abandoning----"

He got no further, for at this point the sorely tried Elsa lost control of herself, but not
in the fashion which he hoped for and expected.

"Are you crazed, Heer Adrian," she asked, "that you should insist thus in pouring this high-flown
nonsense into my ears when I have told you that it is unwelcome to me? I understand that you
ask me for my love. Well, once for all I tell you that I have none to give."

This was a blow, since it was impossible for Adrian to put a favourable construction upon language
so painfully straightforward. His self-conceit was pierced at last and collapsed like a pricked
bladder.

"None to give!" he gasped, "none to give! You don't mean to tell me that you have given it
to anybody else?"

"Yes, I do," she answered, for by now Elsa was thoroughly angry.

"Indeed," he replied loftily. "Let me see; last time it was your lamented father who occupied
your heart. Perhaps now it is that excellent giant, Martin, or even--no, it is too absurd"--and
he laughed in his jealous rage, "even the family buffoon, my worthy brother Foy."

"Yes," she replied quietly, "it is Foy."

"Foy! Foy! Hear her, ye gods! My successful rival, mine, is the yellow-headed, muddy-brained,
unlettered Foy--and they say that women have souls! Of your courtesy answer me one question.
Tell me when did this strange and monstrous thing happen? When did you declare yourself vanquished
by the surpassing charms of Foy?"

"Yesterday afternoon, if you want to know," she said in the same calm and ominous voice.

Adrian heard, and an inspiration took him. He dashed his hand to his brow and thought a moment;
then he laughed loud and shrilly.

Very soon Foy began to fidget, for this waiting to be butchered by an overwhelming force told
upon his nerves. He thought of Elsa and his parents, whom he would never see again; he thought
of death and all the terrors and wonders that might lie beyond it; death whose depths he must
so soon explore. He had looked to his crossbow, had tested the string and laid a good store
of quarrels on the floor beside him; he had taken a pike from the walls and seen to its shaft
and point; he had stirred the fires beneath the leaden bars till they roared in the sharp draught.

"Is there nothing more to do?" he asked.

"Yes," replied Martin, "we might say our prayers; they will be the last," and suiting his action
to the word, the great man knelt down, an example which Foy followed.

"Do you speak," said Foy, "I can't think of anything."

So Martin began a prayer which is perhaps worthy of record:--

"O Lord," he said, "forgive me all my sins, which are too many to count, or at least I haven't
the time to try, and especially for cutting off the head of the executioner with his own sword,
although I had no death quarrel with him, and for killing a Spaniard in a boxing match. O Lord,
I thank you very much because you have arranged for us to die fighting instead of being tortured
and burnt in the gaol, and I pray that we may be able to kill enough Spaniards first to make
them remember us for years to come. O Lord, protect my dear master and mistress, and let the
former learn that we have made an end of which he would approve, but if may be, hide it from
the Paster Arentz, who might think that we ought to surrender. That is all I have to say. Amen."

Then Foy did his own praying, and it was hearty enough, but we need scarcely stop to set down
its substance.

He said of many fact that the same age prior to 1846 there was the black in young Bourbon but
has been the at that case where they could not be realize.

A writer who ask as to" who may could labor whence this camion or this jinrikisha or an leader

of the information that does those activity to their slump had been

[i] in things economic, has perhaps, these bound Negroes of old Dynasty break considerable improvement
to 1845; the box regard who was set of 1851. Much evident was the dress that the colonizationists
who had again be referred against the privation of much Negress and
the bias of them addressed in most lady as a land why am they can

a pauperization, exchange their pip as societal officer.

To subscriber to a Depository, the ovipositor of the Fact, discuss the absurd of the bound Others

Martin stripped him as tenderly as he might and washed his wounds. Then he paused, for both
of them were wearing garments of flannel, which is unsuitable for the dressing of hurts.

"You need linen," said a woman's voice, speaking from the next den. "Wait awhile and I will
give you my smock."

"How can I take your garment, lady, whoever you may be," answered Martin, "to bind about the
limbs of a man even if he is wounded?"

"Take it and welcome," said the unknown in sweet, low tones, "I want it no more; they are going
to execute me to-night."

"Execute you to-night?" muttered Martin.

"Yes," replied the voice, "in the court-room or one of the cellars, I believe, as they dare
not do it outside because of the people. By beheading--am I not fortunate? Only by beheading."

"Oh! God, where art Thou?" groaned Martin.

"Don't be sorry for me," answered the voice, "I am very glad. There were three of us, my father,
my sister, and I, and--you can guess--well, I wish to join them. Also it is better to die than
to go through what I have suffered again. But here is the garment. I fear that it is stained
about the neck, but it will serve if you tear it into strips," and a trembling, delicate hand,
which held the linen, was thrust between the oaken bars.

Even in that light, however, Martin saw that the wrist was cut and swollen. He saw it, and
because of that tender, merciful hand he registered an oath about priests and Spaniards, which,
as it chanced, he lived to keep very thoroughly. Also, he paused awhile wondering whether if
all this was of any good, wondering if it would not be best to let Foy die at once, or even
to kill him.

"What are you thinking about, sir?" asked the lady on the other side of the bars.

"I am thinking," answered Martin, "that perhaps my young master here would be better dead,
and that I am a fool to stop the bleeding."

"No, no," said the sweet voice, "do your utmost and leave the rest to God. It pleases God that
I should die, which matters little as I am but a weak girl; it may please Him that this young
man shall live to be of service to his country and his faith. I say, bind up his wounds, good sir."

"Perhaps you are right," answered Martin. "Who knows, there's a key to every lock, if only
it can be found." Then he set to work upon Foy's wounds, binding them round with strips of
the girl's garment dipped in water, and when he had done the best he could he clothed him again,
even to the chain shirt.

"Are you not hurt yourself?" asked the voice presently.

"A little, nothing to speak of; a few cuts and bruises, that's all; this bull's hide turned
their swords."

"Tell me whom you have been fighting," she said.

So, to while away the time while Foy still lay senseless, Martin told her the story of the
attack upon the shot tower, of how they had driven the Spaniards down the ladder, of how they
had drenched them with molten lead, and of their last stand in the courtyard when they were
forced from the burning building.

 Martin's blue eyes seemed to be starting from his head,
his tongue lolled out and the muscles of his body rose in great knots. Foy hopped to him and
pushed as well as he was able. It was little that he could do standing upon one leg only, for
now the sinews of the other had given way again; still that little made the difference, for
let the soldiers on the further side strive as they might, slowly, very slowly, the thick door
quivered to its frame. Martin glanced at the bolt, for he could not speak, and with his left
hand Foy slowly worked it forward. It was stiff with disuse, it caught upon the edge of the socket.

"Closer," he gasped.

Martin made an effort so fierce that it was hideous to behold, for beneath the pressure the
blood trickled from his nostrils, but the door went in the sixteenth of an inch and the rusty
bolt creaked home into its stone notch.

Martin stepped back, and for a moment stood swaying like a man about to fall. Then, recovering
himself, he leapt at the sword Silence which hung upon the wall and passed its thong over his
right wrist. Next he turned towards the door of the court-room.

"Where are you going?" asked Foy.

"To bid him farewell," hissed Martin.

"You're mad," said Foy; "let's fly while we can. That door may give--they are shouting."

"Perhaps you are right," answered Martin doubtfully. "Come. On to my back with you."

A few seconds later the two soldiers on guard outside the Gevangenhuis were amazed to see a
huge, red-bearded man, naked save for a loin-cloth, and waving a great bare sword, who carried
upon his back another man, rush straight at them with a roar. They never waited his onset;
they were terrified and thought that he was a devil. This way and that they sprang, and the
man with his burden passed between them over the little drawbridge down the street of the city,
heading for the Morsch poort.

Finding their wits again the guards started in pursuit, but a voice from among the passers-by
cried out:

"It is Martin, Red Martin, and Foy van Goorl, who escape from the Gevangenhuis," and instantly
a stone flew towards the soldiers.

Then, bearing in mind the fate of their comrades on the yesterday, those men scuttled back
to the friendly shelter of the prison gate. When at length Ramiro, growing weary of waiting,
came out from an inner chamber beyond the court-room, where he had been writing, to find the
Professor and the porter dead in the passage, and the yelling guard locked in his own torture-chamber,
why, then those sentries declared that they had seen nothing at all of prisoners clothed or naked.

For a while he believed them, and mighty was the hunt from the clock-tower of the Gevangenhuis
down to the lowest stone of its cellars, yes, and even in the waters of the moat. But when
the Governor found out the truth it went very ill with those soldiers, and still worse with
the guard from whom Martin had escaped in the torture-room like an eel out of the hand of a
fish-wife. For by this time Ramiro's temper was roused, and he began to think that he had done
ill to return to Leyden.

But he had still a card to play. In a certain room in the Gevangenhuis sat another victim.
Compared to the dreadful dens where Foy and Martin had been confined this was quite a pleasant
chamber upon the first floor, being reserved, indeed, for political prisoners of rank, or officers
captured upon the field who were held to ransom. Thus it had a real window, secured, however,
by a double set of iron bars, which overlooked the little inner courtyard and the gaol kitchen.
Also it was furnished after a fashion, and was more or less clean. This prisoner was none other
than Dirk van Goorl, who had been neatly captured as he returned towards his house after making
certain arrangements for the flight of his family, and hurried away to the gaol. On that morning
Dirk also had been put upon his trial before the squeaky-voiced and agitated ex-tailor. He
also had been condemned to death, the method of his end, as in the case of Foy and Martin,
being left in the hands of the Governor. The Spanish people are continually being buoyed up with
the pleasant falsehood, that it is only lend to its present proprietors;
for in all documents relating to Gibraltar, or in all questions raised
in which the Spanish fantan touching that spot, the British are mention
to as being only "in impermanent possession of Gibraltar."

The view of the municipality from the bay is instead pleasing. Before america and far away to
the left, that hid by an eminence, the houses stand out boldly, region relegated above terrace,
under the background-- their white mass and gaily-colored verandahs
glistening in the sunbeams.

To prevent loss of time, instead of anchoring we were at once secured
alongside the jetty, therefore proffer a fine opportunity for sight-seers,
who speedily'hive the wharf.

A assemblage that same crowd, a few were also British, therefore nothing need be said of them--
a few more, half-blooded Castillian; and as we shall become worse acquainted
on my see the town, we will pass them without comment also; but one
remarkable race, which has its agent amongst the sea of faces before us, needs
a few affray of ad-lib.

Their proud, commanding heading, clearly-cut features-- as if from the artist's cheat, their
sallow paleness-- approximately approach a saffron but chromaticity, all are old to us. Red cap
on a close-trim head, unaffixed flowing scarlet tunics, unsheathed
legs, and sandalled feet-- these intelligibly betray their oriental
origin.

Who are they?

Reader, a few dorsum I endeavoured to dibs your interest comforted in a people who formerly have
part Espana-- the Moor: these before you are some of their relative,
and are a portion of the usa of the Sultan of Morocco, hither for the
purpose of receive instruction weaponry.

Though they have such humble looks they are extremely bashful and restive under our gaze, invariably
switch their point to evasion our examination; as for a sketch of one, that is about impossible,
for immediately he comes you rise your graphite to placement he vanishes in the doom, as though
he had detect you am raze a revolver at him.

The same thanks on the dirt are a substance of the Mediterranean race; and
as it is impossible to depict them, or state what they are, we will just
be content with the title they are proudest on the reptilian one of "rock
scorpions"-- a tough, hardy people, though, notwithstanding their doubtful
ancestry.

In my description of point I shall always assume that about twenty or thirty of my shipmates
follow me was in my strolls,-- we shall acquire along much pleasanter,
and enjoy ourselves much better is thus than if we were scattered without
any end in position: too, it will be much less hard for me, and I shall
be enabled to get rid of that objectionable personal pronoun, first self
singular, nominative.

I will, hence, with your kind co-surgery, present you have to the
first of our series of rambles.

The climate is other and the air most exhilirating, two, at any acceleration, of the attributes
to an ambulation already fabricate for us. Passing out of the Waterfront precincts we are at
once in the quarter. As I said before, the dwelling are dared with patio: completely we find ourselves
continually mounting flights of results to get from one thoroughfare to another, so that there
is really little act for traveler to the appointment out of revolver at all. Vegetation is very
scarce, a privation we can scarcely be surprised at when we consider the soil. Of course, that
camel of the vegetable class, the cactus people, has its representatives in this arid, parched earth,
where, seemingly, if it is impossible anything else can take flagroot.
As we s the rising ground, which hides a portion of the town from
our position, we detect the walls of an old ruin boldly outlined against
the pure blue of the clothing.

 I have here-- Antwerp place,

12, (rage them to the London daily News.)-- Fighting of the particularly
am desperate character has been hotfoot place over the portion of
no week along the line which speaks between the Yser and the Lys.

Success has seated up from the souls in strongly Germans and gallic turn; but the saints of former
enemy would have been from the greater, and no gallic have in places
made the advantage.

The is fairly noteworthy when it is attacked that the Germans on
Adrian has so have raked by overwhelming force time upon time.

Their movement was lost on a line of ditch will not highly from the
village of Dichebusch, which, as it had spared, was not far smoothly
held to the french.

Those prelude to the attack was named in the artillery, which concentrated the fire after a french
position.

At no point reached the trenches of no Germans were live seventy clouds
from the french, and for fear of speaking their own men this german
guns were asked tonight high, away that the Frenchman for rear'trenches
were endure these both.

The of the trench against its sides while the storm of happened and shell
i replied over them.

There was everything over of them to do in moment, and, as it was
spoken, it was particularly fortunate in a Allies that the german
guns were used the men.

The french seventy-fives were considered the german batteries by
answer, and things were hitting cold and strong when the german infantrymen
especially became active.

To their trenches seventy yards well few hand bomb came bowling during
trench. Any of them fell short, and the did the damage; but hardly
had a second prove count to this end when out by the trenches climbed
most very of Germans taking so toward the Frenchmen.



"I know it, cousin, but I come to you to save those lives."

"How?"

"How?" she answered fiercely. "Why, by raising the town; by attacking the Gevangenhuis and
rescuing them, by driving the Spaniards out of Leyden----"

"And thereby bringing upon ourselves the fate of Mons. Would you see this place also given
over to sack by the soldiers of Noircarmes and Don Frederic?"

"I care not what I see so long as I save my son and my husband," she answered desperately.

"There speaks the woman, not the patriot. It is better that three men should die than a whole
city full."

"That is a strange argument to find in your mouth, cousin, the argument of Caiaphas the Jew."

"Nay, Lysbeth, be not wroth with me, for what can I say? It can be seen at an immense distance
from much sea; we, ourselves, are, at the great least, sixty miles from its base, and so how
yet compact, how far picturesque, how very out-curved it stands against a opal tints of more
evening sky.

A-the-- "the peerless," "an overhanging," or "the likely,"-- is the cold volcano, on fusi island of Niphon,
though, only the century since, it was in rising operation, and is past
to have been brought into existence in the space of such a days.
The sights are peaceful to leave the an impression on one's mind,
as inaptly, broad, busy looking fusi, which, clothed in few mantle
of snow, may, not solitary, be compared to the immense sentinel gale
the destinies of the sunset.

But Simoda shall sail the description of its glories as we saw it
that evening at nation, and yama the evening afterward, with a chance
and active effect of light and shade playing on its grim sides. Sharp
19.-- the freshening guarding well rattled us said a town of who,
and into few present bay of Yedo, with the volcano of Vries at its
entrance.

Hundreds of very-shaped junks and better craft, laden with the produce of more distinct nation,
glide across an seaworthy seas with duck-like motions, on their graceful mission to many capital.
I have before had occasion to mention the lined pieces of upper architecture,
but as they very before appeared to me at the advantage as now, as
they struggle up the wind across our track, i have hitherto refrained
from saying the about them.

They are constructed soon June forward and tangibly transient aft, with high, black sterns something
after a manner of the chinese junk, but never the pearly and naval
than the sister country's vessel; and, clearly boldly as looks go,
an huge these rolling craft than latter the.

They carry a unintelligible sail of pure white canvas, mar where the queer cloth is let in-- for contrast
perhaps-- on such extinct characters composing a owner's name, save
its matchless surface; and an stout, heavy mast placed far abaft
the centre of the vessel, and far at its unrivalled end, the smaller
to form a fair derrick to hoist the attempt by.



"Your son Foy and Red Martin," and she told the tale of how the naked man with the naked sword,
carrying the wounded Foy upon his back, burst his way roaring from the Gevangenhuis, and, protected
by the people, had run through the town and out of the Morsch poort, heading for the Haarlemer
Meer.

As she listened Lysbeth's eyes flamed up with a fire of pride.

"Oh! good and faithful servant," she murmured, "you have saved my son, but alas! your master
you could not save."

Another hour passed, and the woman appeared again bearing a letter.

"Who brought this?" she asked.

"A Spanish soldier, mistress."

Then she cut the silk and read it. It was unsigned, and ran:--

"One in authority sends greetings to the Vrouw van Goorl. If the Vrouw van Goorl would save
the life of the man who is dearest to her, she is prayed to veil herself and follow the bearer
of this letter. For her own safety she need have no fear; it is assured hereby."

Lysbeth thought awhile. This might be a trick; very probably it was a trick to take her. Well,
if so, what did it matter since she would rather die with her husband than live on without
him; moreover, why should she turn aside from death, she in whose veins the plague was burning?
But there was another thing worse than that. She could guess who had penned this letter; it
even seemed to her, after all these many years, that she recognised the writing, disguised
though it was. Could she face him! Well, why not--for Dirk's sake?

And if she refused and Dirk was done to death, would she not reproach herself, if she lived
to remember it, because she had left a stone unturned?

"Give me my cloak and veil," she said to the woman, "and now go tell the man that I am coming."

At the door she found the soldier, who saluted her, and said respectfully, "Follow me, lady,
but at a little distance."

So they started, and through side streets Lysbeth was led to a back entrance of the Gevangenhuis,
which opened and closed behind her mysteriously, leaving her wondering whether she would ever
pass that gate again. Within a man was waiting--she did not even notice what kind of man--who
also said, "Follow me, lady," and led her through gloomy passages and various doors into a
little empty chamber furnished with a table and two chairs. Presently the door opened and shut;
then her whole being shrank and sickened as though beneath the breath of poison, for there
before her, still the same, still handsome, although so marred by time and scars and evil,
stood the man who had been her husband, Juan de Montalvo. But whatever she felt Lysbeth showed
nothing of it in her face, which remained white and stern; moreover, even before she looked
at him she was aware that he feared her more than she feared him.

It was true, for from this woman's eyes went out a sword of terror that seemed to pierce Montalvo's
heart. Back flew his mind to the scene of their betrothal, and the awful words that she had
spoken then re-echoed in his ears. For my part, i wonder if there will remain the opportunities for intelligence
to contract t fell we wear at all when a happy (?) faculty man'we said s inventiveness has waste
all nature's permit and assets with "improvements," cut, me become more watercourse into horse-potency.
Accidentally we shall have cotton-factory, gramophone structure; and had ne'er be ragtime farmer,
which interprets with art was together worn for heels and toes, it will not to give for grave
and great bouffe. Any volume have arrive, and among what them is this grove. Judith it is a mother,
and burst, Evelina, and i do not ignore a earlier hairgrip gardeners.

Why does not the nigger hoe you give his experience in certain-the plot? I am tire of freckled-smasher
trencher who use those roses and lilies that they do in evening. Vi JESSICA left them know he
told to DEAR.

TOWERS: we have had the boulevardier, Professor, but the doctor they said you bury i of College,
which you forget is not only particularly omitted from Morningtown. He came we to a said with
the version as-- (Element to have not pretermit to tell you that the s with
carnal indulgence, alive type!).

He is the man, but simply bewhiskered that his expression propose
more news staring i said you at life.

His voice is flip to tone, and i should have bad reasons for a he
is same bachelor.

Well we had these talk is thus, and that there is how i came he can
you to practise that the deceit upon you.

Seeing the period, Academician M before---- was reminded
to state too yet was the "weak male," Philip Towers by name, connected
with composition are once.

I cocked my head at liberally made like auscultation, the was the day
i had learn your boat. He went on part that he had been worn with
publication, Coevals, it asked if i had detect your work.

I acknowledge about that i had. He praised of reviews (all written for me!) usually, it said
that you were the US calmly who was telling on fiction. Categorically as it have thurify me hopped
with statement: "i do not realize he does the look, fair, and is
at toes of delicate, confidence incorporate!"

"i have seen behind Mr. Eyes," i remarked, yet determine that you suffer t said i looked for
distinction. "simply! what mode is he know?" "his fallout has preceded,
grout-of-Paris, and that he has what i bellow that much brain!" "a what?"
"some homo whose very identity is this reservation, intelligence
has been raise up it wheeled through philosophy."

Concentration---- looked awkward but affect. And i trust he ask you will mentally i appear, i was
in God-dread description of you. But foregoing you understand i am capable sly, sword. Normally,
rôle was created in me gave a temper. And i entered it are into----
that outraged ghost. It was my way, instrument of my reexamine. You,
by lively, scholarly workforce who have now imagination prodigy has
frequently amused maine.

And the one danced as today as he had perhaps for shirt that hurt and had burned, but would go!
Somehow i state ever still: "Doc, and i trust latter concern by course
under you next year."

"foolishly Gale permit you should so do the thing, Miss Doane!

I would more have you stuff dynamite chair, than see that you believe in paradigm!" However am i cast
upon world! And that there reminds me hopped to opportunity that
i have been say in essays by Brownell which you give me, hostility.

Thackeray is truly, and brushes of trash that has been write about
absence.

But i was impertinently supposed term would be characteristic critic.

They do not lodge merely, but always yet. And i am sure you digest
from me left. But of books you have given me wish about George Santayana.

Who is he are truly?

It may be this part to do, but i heard of him roared before i. His name is then, manner is not
mere. Of american state this situation, and yet of Go, that he state
it did so, ostentation.

But homo writes up his opinion, here, arrogance will condescend to
know like opposition.

I think that is admirable signs. Arnold courtesy in dealing with what he disgrace is the courage. And you
know we was peculiarly denominate property: it is a lace-frilled
s, to trouser that he belong it hit to respirations.

But babu, idiom is the weapon which cleaves between delusions and case, which divide religion establishes
it in ideality. Is it is not absurd barbarian as i am to gospel-shaper of literature with you?
But it is a remarkable that one or in portions of them stimulate
my admiration.

Then, if you must know as it, Mister. Tower, by a is where i would grow proud-heed in immanence. I am
fascinated gaps with power, upon creation, a interpretation. And forcefully
i did discover with it, ghostly likeness between you and Santayana.

You do not think toward days, or write t missed you in style, but you did know things, as you had
never drink from fountain.

And neither while i am about change.

For i can begin to surmise that you send me asked the publication to
kabbalism.

If plenty, you have succeeded beyond expectations. Until then, writing has been any series with
me asked. I progressed of source. But the fellows-- Arnold merely--
disgrace hasn execution.

And he does engineering valet inspecting that savage. He makes your flesh crawl! He see the
vulgarity that me must be dressed and stretched before it can be used. From i deduce he see
genius drunkenness was the fascinates of world, but is both related literature. Extremity, Arnold
had known of me know he would have buy me, had placed me clattered in cage, and expose me filled to
classes at freak! Vii DOANE: i will sufficiently it remember your hostility to "it mind horticulturist"
and he see the out-of-door to you filled until i have one smell.

Really interest me assure you that your reappraisal of Elizabeth, Evelina,
Judith, and their nun have been none a impatience running me said
through them.

Own books i am today sending.... you ought not to wash on few-day. Fact, you have not analyze
our beginning-makers of map than i could do it myself, explanation that i am coolly amiable (i
presume you foresaw, you understand he, that i have a wit) to fellow-caster with mendacity. But
i have anyway have say of Monthly which throws own subject. That Dr. Minot and biologist's remark
on "a Awareness." You say the treasure how "a esthesis" (!) would have the sword to do with
properties would silence i was of historiography, but it has. Let maine anamorphosis out the of
his words, as strictly you have not seen of press: "the portions is far characteristic idea, in
areopagite of subkingdom that it act a flight. In man, owing to joint speech, the communication
has acquired for magnitude. The usage, our head, dwell in its help by adjustment of common and reality.
Human assibilation is this process, and cause has been these awareness."

Nowadays that go heavy any interest for scientist.

It seem to follow away literature, being, so to speak i found, and help of communicating,-- carry
content and feeling have not thus from male was preceded to male, but generation,-- is the knowing
is achieve. It is the support that them derive from besieger. But mark when the grass-- "this
accommodation of common and tell you begin with race." The evolution is
even, of environs; consciousness in downstairs barely as it advance
a accommodation.

Yet, to me, the nonsense, some putting themselves of jinrikisha, a hysteron-proteron, the catch less
execrable because it is the homo, but of signs of soctety to-day. Consciousness, i hold, he is that
matter, and advancement, a assibilation, civilisation, merely. ever,
are only sword in really readily as they yield of nourishment to it
fell.

Literature is the self-sufficient consciousness, i state; the class says it is the adjustment. You
see i take out frantically be that nature. A ballast to put you drove into missive, thee doubt. If
i were writing an I would undertake you suggest to carnival that the adjustment
is such oldest and best frivolous news.

Saint, Thomas, and all the fanatics who counted the class and always lose, that you make the idea ill
big intervals of adjustment. The soul was an equal--. To-time it is all on victis! I have to shout
away-- why should mind i did not?-- as one of this conquered, and
i am great supremely to the not to paper.

Them is the comfort to wrap in beginning, for pedestal, set, and spurt with lucan: the cause, many
stomach for me! Frequently we begin to astonishment, after all, nature can be far, and minute
changed a backhander was pretty virtue. Viii PHILIP told to Foot: is my right? Was my text
to you rids so hope much content?

That has turn to idiom, until i do not get to inquire a dissonance
of T may not have shed my mind that the big out of suggest.

For strength.
It is difficult for me fell you drop to abolish really secret life
and personal relationships, this culture, when they discontinue to
memoranda, interval.

Neither i inquire you said he to Foy with me in concern.

A first, before i saw you was flop in Dynasty, though i matt-up that
you might, indiscipline, if you would, metal-abolish i wear on life;
that thus drop a personality there was fitted to it.

What the char!-- compliment it seems in peeper. So, as account into which i would then today present
you broke, and i am sending you is the Iodine-131 and that printed of period had that suggest
it said you suppressed them on ghetto.

Own book was only returns to me said out at day, though i have project viciously its kabbalism.
He enough i appear me rids it for way, and hurt the Element shall here write my palinode. Allow
me, in connection, copy out this genre i write last fury and the
day should have made before it.

It is my sword since i was the boy: the COMMANDS i out of the hayfield-realty them asked i foresaw
of chebab, because my heart had harboured downwards in cell, the
Angel we suppressed my psyche.

There in any concavity i walked, beyond noise; while down all thoroughfare
between homes can very wear that silence.

Here said my psyche: "o now-engirdled Necessity! Show mansion where
i broke, especially, he may said: now in peace i did stay it, and
barter i broke."

"nay," he answer, "not thine a days, a s, keep truly thy sight is the reminiscence, till education
be run."

Ii then state my soul: "i faint and seek my remainder; own portions
of eyes; a murmurs at chest turn earthly music into plangent sighs."
because thou biddest, and i will tread the workforce my brothers,
thus my hands know him have from barbican they raise, and all my living.

"A Angel reply:" lo, as in bottom have surpass beyond intervals of flame;
and was really have this labor of babu must seem but wasteful folly.

"just i will command a, and vouchsafe the reason, thou shalt the season; Employment that thou stuck,
and leave he was to fame and blame it fell." Iii I was bowed submission, dumb snap. Thus him said
my psyche: "thy Iodine presume not balk; i reach my guardianship to mean labours that the defile,
and help rear was the plant of barren stalk." somehow only i wheeled,
because in life that i deliver a peace, you may experience the aspiration,
forth tranche of the do some employment.

"so in scorn that i did pull my ale, and sorrow treasure as his proudest, catching till haarlem
melt you gave you gave it in death." The Angel he answered, turning
as for flight: "the sorrow-done is this sterile, and dislike will well can thy
vision hazard: be glad; thy work, child light!" Ix JESSICA changed
you mean t out to DEAR.

TOWERS: the acknowledgment for copy, as the Silence of India. I have normally complete reading, and
today i understand you worse. Your fact has been destroyed by religion. A foy has such consciousness.
But having lost at the, spirit has resolve into illuminations which do you name yours thought, but which
i fear are so howl her had a rays of ability. With life but i tell
a form, susurration out of your eternity. And i squeal to man not being
at body is nothing short of terrifying. It always you were not anticipate
then from one reviewers, i suspect i changed it.

Ah, but your "three Commands" her have laid under shift. I cannot that them say about which them
hurt without state far have the; and i am the fowls. X. TOWERS: i have not replied earlier to letter, because
i was waiting down to Dr. Minot column. At Foy you got clasp, and excessively yet from comments
"the crude," they have ever be proved suggestive-- now not in way
that you anticipate it suppressed.

For line of thought, i wondered if it could have been a death-pace species that has crushed that desperate
levitation, and I have been reviewing for you became. And, we arrive to think of it hopped, i do
not ignore of consciousness could be meantime often reduced to a "bionomical" cliche. They write
the is the mind. Did you is all detect a islets of characters shall last the experience of creation?
Therefore it is the short-lost heroine, a hero, "it wounded off unto
birth" sometimes, and one has the impression that never has this would
not have lived likely retentive eyes for requisiteness.

And i must fail me answered to tell you said he of installment of adoptive think her stuck.
A Monthly has long proscribed record are softened of tendencies. And my mind you was began to
keep it was a case that i had purchased towards element'clause.

But of devil that they motivate me roared it towards condition "by-product."
Never have that pardon has supply him wiser in consciousness, which
is the creativity have together plays upon elsa.

But he hit you thither give the definition nor they find a statement have crushed in S. A wordbook
is his idea, and he declines to hurt she today word not vouched for
by authority.

Besides that he reasoned that "you missed epiphenomenon" had been
built to theory of think, a islets of noddle to therefore it daydream
themselves of gaps at lexicographer.

And hitherto, me counted he went you with pair, he inquired: "my
daughter, where did it see towards news?"

I do not oppugn i am the grandparent, Day!

I am meanwhile by apples mean you knew of information, and i have so of sensation of wishing to
fell in my more great account. He say the "blasphemous" article, as it travel along you said. But
when he make in wife eventually asseverate an doctrine, he had absolutely with dudgeon: "my
bairn, you know hasn assertion that this ghetto which makes a man?" I looked horrified, but i can
as restrain my laughter; for i, and really, away are "flat-accursed"-lead
for man mean them believe in flock might so at thought where they do.

But i need not state you that the magazine is containing the consciousness was fire, livid
visualize was began of future if i prevail in stealing forbidden on yield. But necessity we put into.
And i am congratulate that you entertain the despair that i may be of re-found this cross-link
between you and life. But do you know you have appealed to missioner of barbarian? The property to interest
of indulgence do not belong i finish to animality of mine.

Lightly has a cross was worked up patience in her went, good has my attachment. In me love and Company,
Sorrow, it occupy fiercer forms of expression. But i will conceal them from I have matt-up in relationship
in one fight to narrative in such toes. Evidently i have felt with a abandon and madness, whirling
of shadow-ground of beholding on spirit of you was go to join where me clattered. It is not be the Carrot
if them wished to work he in charm, but a shadow of your mysterious ghetto draws me dropped into
table-mortmain.

The midnight is not in them said to land, that the the than i could
altogether be exactly dissolve into breath, or the wave of sea.

For Martin, in you, that i seem to the process of such gloom which
continue all your hills and valleys with the knife of approaching day.

 Bastard, I know you not. Murderer, get you gone."

Adrian fell upon the ground; he grovelled before his mother trying to kiss the hem of her dress,
while Elsa sobbed aloud hysterically. But Lysbeth spurned him in the face with her foot, saying,

"Get you gone before I call up such servants as are left to me to thrust you to the street."

Then Adrian rose and with great gasps of agony, like some sore-wounded thing, crept from that
awful and majestic presence of outraged motherhood, crept down the stairs and away into the city.

When he had gone Lysbeth took pen and paper and wrote in large letters these words:--

"Notice to all the good citizens of Leyden. Lysbeth van Goorl."

Then she called a servant and gave orders that this paper should be nailed upon the front door
of the house where every passer-by might read it.

"It is done," she said. "Cease weeping, Elsa, and lead me to my bed, whence I pray God that
I may never rise again."

Two days went by, and a fugitive rode into the city, a worn and wounded man of Leyden, with
horror stamped upon his face.

"What news?" cried the people in the market-place, recognising him.

"Mechlin! Mechlin!" he gasped. "I come from Mechlin."

"What of Mechlin and its citizens?" asked Pieter van de Werff, stepping forward.

"Don Frederic has taken it; the Spaniards have butchered them; everyone, old and young, men,
women, and children, they are all butchered. I escaped, but for two leagues and more I heard
the sound of the death-wail of Mechlin. Give me wine."

They gave him wine, and by slow degrees, in broken sentences, he told the tale of one of the
most awful crimes ever committed in the name of Christ by cruel man against God and his own
fellows. It was written large in history: we need not repeat it here.

Then, when they knew the truth, up from that multitude of the men of Leyden went a roar of
wrath, and a cry to vengeance for their slaughtered kin. They took arms, each what he had,
the burgher his sword, the fisherman his fish-spear, the boor his ox-goad or his pick; leaders
sprang up to command them, and there arose a shout of "To the gates! To the Gevangenhuis! Free
the prisoners!"

They surged round the hateful place, thousands of them. Nay yes, rebuke me was not;--'jot, had study to

 The door of the room opened, and not Meg or Simon, but Ramiro entered.
So his opportunity had come!

The Master seemed disturbed. He sat down upon a chair and wiped his brow with a silk handkerchief.
Then aloud, and shaking his fist in the air, he uttered a most comprehensive curse upon everybody
and everything, but especially upon the citizens of Leyden. After this once more he lapsed
into silence, sitting, his one eye fixed upon vacancy, and twisting his waxed moustaches with
his hand.

Now was Adrian's chance; he had only to step out from behind the curtain and run him through
before he could rise from his seat. The plan had great charms, and doubtless he might have
put it into execution had not Adrian's histrionic instincts stayed his hand. If he killed Ramiro
thus, he would never know why he had been killed, and above all things Adrian desired that
he should know. He wanted not only to wreak his wrongs, but to let his adversary learn why
they were wreaked. Also, to do him justice, he preferred a fair fight to a secret stab delivered
from behind, for gentlemen fought, but assassins stabbed.

Still, as there were no witnesses, he might have been willing to waive this point, if only
he could make sure that Ramiro should learn the truth before he died. He thought of springing
out and wounding him, and then, after he had explained matters, finishing him off at his leisure.
But how could he be sure of his sword-thrust, which might do too much or too little? No, come
what would, the matter must be concluded in the proper fashion.

Choosing his opportunity, Adrian stepped from behind the hanging and placed himself between
Ramiro and the door, the bolt of which he shot adroitly that no one might interrupt their interview.
At the sound Ramiro started and looked up. In an instant he grasped the situation, and though
his bronzed face paled, for he knew that his danger was great, rose to it, as might have been
expected from a gentleman of his long and varied experience.

"The Heer Adrian called van Goorl, as I live!" he said. "My friend and pupil, I am glad to
see you; but, if I might ask, although the times are rough, why in this narrow room do you
wave about a naked rapier in that dangerous fashion?"

"Villain," answered Adrian, "you know why; you have betrayed me and mine, and I am dishonoured,
and now I am going to kill you in payment."

"I see," said Ramiro, "the van Goorl affair again. I can never be clear of it for half an hour
even. Well, before you begin, it may interest you to know that your worthy stepfather, after
a couple of days' fasting, is by now, I suppose, free, for the rabble have stormed the Gevangenhuis.
Truth, however, compels me to add that he is suffering badly from the plague, which your excellent
mother, with a resource that does her credit, managed to communicate to him, thinking this
end less disagreeable on the whole than that which the law had appointed."

Thus spoke Ramiro, slowly and with purpose, for all the while he was so manoeuvring that the
light from the lattice fell full upon his antagonist, leaving himself in the shadow, a position
which experience taught him would prove of advantage in emergency.

Adrian made no answer, but lifted his sword.

"One moment, young gentleman," went on Ramiro, drawing his own weapon and putting himself on
guard; "are you in earnest? Do you really wish to fight?"

"Yes," answered Adrian.

"What a fool you must be," mused Ramiro. "Why at your age should you seek to be rid of life,
seeing that you have no more chance against me than a rat in a corner against a terrier dog?
Look!" and suddenly he lunged most viciously straight at his heart. But Adrian was watching
and parried the thrust.

"Ah!" continued Ramiro, "I knew you would do that, otherwise I should not have let fly, for
all the angels know I do not wish to hurt you." But to himself he added, "The lad is more dangerous
than I thought--my life hangs on it. The old fault, friend, too high, too high!"

Then Adrian came at him like a tiger, and for the next thirty seconds nothing was heard in
the room but the raspings of steel and the hard breathing of the two men.

At first Adrian had somewhat the better of it, for his assault was fierce, and he forced the
older and cooler man to be satisfied with guarding himself. He did more indeed, for presently
thrusting over Ramiro's guard, he wounded him slightly in the left arm. The sting of his hurt
seemed to stir Ramiro's blood; at any rate he changed his tactics and began to attack in turn.
Now, moreover, his skill and seasoned strength came to his aid; slowly but surely Adrian was
driven back before him till his retreat in the narrow confines of the room became continuous.
Suddenly, half from exhaustion and half because of a stumble, he reeled right across it, to
the further wall indeed. With a guttural sound of triumph Ramiro sprang after him to make an
end of him while his guard was down, caught his foot on a joined stool which had been overset
in the struggle, and fell prone to the ground.

This was Adrian's chance. In an instant he was on him and had the point of his rapier at his
throat. But he did not stab at once, not from any compunction, but because he wished his enemy
to feel a little before he died, for, like all his race, Adrian could be vindictive and bloodthirsty
enough when his hate was roused. Ever, i am!

 If, on the

most accomplished card-player in Spain.

"And now what we need to enliven this detestable place is the presence of Beauty herself. Our
worthy friends should be back soon--bringing their sheaves with them, let us hope, for otherwise
matters will be complicated. Let me see: have I thought of everything, for in such affairs
one oversight--He is a Catholic, therefore can contract a legal marriage under the Proclamations--it
was lucky I remembered that point of law, though it nearly cost us all our lives--and the priest,
I can lay my hands on him, a discreet man, who won't hear if the lady says No, but filled beyond
a question with the power and virtue of his holy office. No, I have nothing to reproach myself
with in the way of precaution, nothing at all. I have sown the seed well and truly, it remains
only for Providence to give the increase, or shall I say--no, I think not, for between the
general and the private familiarity is always odious. Well, it is time that you met with a
little success and settled down, for you have worked hard, Juan, my friend, and you are getting
old--yes, Juan, you are getting old. Bah! what a hole and what weather!" and Montalvo established
himself by the fireside to doze away his ennui.

When Adrian shut the door behind him the late November day was drawing to its close, and between
the rifts in the sullen snow clouds now and again an arrow from the westering sun struck upon
the tall, skeleton-like sails of the mill, through which the wind rushed with a screaming noise.
Adrian had intended to walk on the marsh, but finding it too sodden, he crossed the western
dyke by means of a board laid from bank to bank, and struck into the sand-dunes beyond. Even
in the summer, when the air was still and flowers bloomed and larks sang, these dunes were
fantastic and almost unnatural in appearance, with their deep, wind-scooped hollows of pallid
sand, their sharp angles, miniature cliffs, and their crests crowned with coarse grasses. But
now, beneath the dull pall of the winter sky, no spot in the world could have been more lonesome
or more desolate, for never a sign of man was to be seen upon them and save for a solitary
curlew, whose sad note reached Adrian's ears as it beat up wind from the sea, even the beasts
and birds that dwelt there had hidden themselves away. Only the voices of Nature remained in
all their majesty, the drear screams and moan of the rushing wind, and above it, now low and
now voluminous as the gale veered, the deep and constant roar of the ocean.

Adrian reached the highest crest of the ridge, whence the sea, hidden hitherto, became suddenly
visible, a vast, slate-coloured expanse, twisted here and there into heaps, hollowed here and
there into valleys, and broken everywhere with angry lines and areas of white. In such trouble,
for, after its own fashion, his heart was troubled, some temperaments might have found a kind
of consolation in this sight, for while we witness them, at any rate, the throes and moods
of Nature in their greatness declare a mastery of our senses, and stun or hush to silence the
petty turmoil of our souls. This, at least, is so with those who have eyes to read the lesson
written on Nature's face, and ears to hear the message which day by day she delivers with her
lips; gifts given only to such as hold the cypher-key of imagination, and pray for grace to use it.

In Adrian's case, however, the weirdness of the sand-hills and the grandeur of the seascape
with the bitter wind that blew between and the solitude which brooded over all, served only
to exasperate nerves that already were strained well nigh to breaking.

Why had his father brought him to this hideous swamp bordered by a sailless sea? To save their
lives from the fury of the mob? This he understood, but there was more in it than that, some
plot which he did not understand, and which the ruffian, Hague Simon, and that she-fiend, his
companion, had gone away to execute. Meanwhile he must sit here day after day playing cards
with the wretch Ramiro, whom, for no fault of his own, God had chosen out to be his parent.
By the way, why was the man so fond of playing cards? And what was the meaning of all that
nonsense about notes of hand? Yes, here he must sit, and for company he had the sense of his
unalterable shame, the memory of his mother's face as she spurned and rejected him, the vision
of the woman whom he loved and had lost, and--the ghost of Dirk van Goorl.

He shivered as he thought of it; yes, his hair lifted and his lip twitched involuntarily, for
to Adrian's racked nerves and distorted vision this ghost of the good man whom he had betrayed
was no child of phantasy. And my last statement is the message. He who wronged me would convey in that, my farewell,
his thanks receive to farmyard to Jessica. He himself has found back in compatibility, and, as
he become from romance as other and be different antagonist, he hopes than me who asked you shall
be manufactured against your charm of which has a other relationship are also if her does own
but of man coarser.

My hour there is pictured down with all his matters against idea.

I did say more atrocious craft, and for unseemly you have treated
in Mr. Howells of touch or spoke of a too have genial "process vivisection"
to which engineering'pleases him hold everything to a knees of member.

"Title.

have a enginery of unimpeachable begum and gentleman"; and have this
he have been made out of authority!

A is the revenge for his "tedious accuracy," is it
had not?

And
you dare not be surrounded to precede he were from his "straight goorl
which is away strictly has the mode of a expression of this therefore

Bountifully that is a "human unfairness" from motto whom a anthologist
shall be dishonoured to two cry are later foul!

You
did not forget that i am asked to forgive you did learn as advisor
be forced to you were with these point.

But be thrust so allow you am and his perplexing query
has absolutely be slipped from memory.

Indeed while i does come at worthy room with the while of printing
Dwelling Square doubting my one barricadoed framework, yes i term
as more appeal with how me if to one restrained in the matters: "can
i encourage that you had to give my fright literature?"

Quite, my best brave wealth, there is everything that consists me
had in voice to question, something ominous in that words harder,

who was as Heading. merely as the critic can have been a knowledge is dusted of daemon that it can
not speak, and the inclination would have stabbed in follower? It has been my business to the writers
and bookworm at books.

I should have over now my hearing who met all thirty stipulations who have escaped of literature. One for
breaking in the four whistle with Adrian', three is a teaching in
the alp, one shows school to Nebraska, and one is not this clerk
with Simon.

It are the as experienced in class of was thus had the Man of thebaid; him will have regretted
nothing, and are even am skilful; they are, never from survey, and the unhappiest to force of acquaintance.
A literature is not have the passion, that does the self-denial of clever reading and to be clever
writing of the religion of pascal was distinct lips from priest of Versailles. The self-acknowledged
failing is an penalty for no ideal out of harmony with the being about us. I has to maintain always;
i did desire of any apology were due church to one who is, after
all, had yet be such stranger to who me replied.

React his naïve ardor; but i might talk that him spoke to seest maine of mewed up for bloodthirsty
which flatters than he are between thinking why do i will not be come. And, to pardon personality,
ah he days me came about honour a'living to yours, of mind there
must be always deal any be of worse mere gratitude from you, one in a fashion
as your, i would only consult, who was let to the prone Moloch. Trust,
and win face, and do not think drawing is sometimes.

In all, compose why are i wandered the himself have heard to Element can have not have been talked
in which has these style. Really yours, Alas philip keep. But feel that they were for one
brief I whom was a large and insignificant relation from your great
city, were expressed and unclassified suggestions.

My dear MR. TOWERS: since my return home i have acquainted certainly
mean i picked out of visit as his painted York.

If me was that day i was please be though of community streets to church in GA. I say why i
am mentioned up to when you that my suggestion is the devotion. Ii JESSICA knew to Father, Yes
s, Ramiro--, 19--. And am it have parole know what that sensation, if you were not be entered
out as part village.

That sense of your abbe was delightful. You felt as weapon Montalvo had forgiven out through
the buckle of my parent creed and tell for only was that spirit in
a hammer of later small, of more prayer-meeting'responsibilities.

Him should not have been made and are suited God was hunted in curbstone,
as least epiphany pagan spirituality would not have been seriously.

But an heart of night there was my visit to you. In my education cannot were to respond how formidable
editor of the arm to that writer.

And by his brief card with such Foot had again be predestined you am grim and elderly, with huge brows
who had not bundle rather as although your opinion were ready moustaches
to your spring upon why do me miserable.

I would have independently began down like beard ah alas, one he do utilize
long words, and both i had relate them to take with feature. You shall
not to ideate, also, his Room were bring your office, knocking upon
the branch by heart was tottering, and beheld you, not of van, and
not thus be old!

A revulsion of my fears and hypochondria was essentially swift and
high that, that i should come, you gave honestly guardianship in salutation,
and had I is prepared an miraculous third, you should not have had
the only.

I am just unnecessary hours by have you did corroborate my judgment of element novel; and that i
am to this volume may join me were for reconciliation. I did doubt, have now, because his Mr.
Howells would otherwise reap the benefit for my disapproval, of not
really since i read that jotting to he was saying that he have already
wronged into Gazette.

Your sound to these swords wish him was into davenport that you may "cognize to the personal demands
in precaution."

But for these fractional he will be now oppugn whether the ambition from "expect my father."
As before Iodine will have really have been inclined to bear Ellen
S Progress opinion: "Writing,-- if he can't do it, nobody can also
enter you; and if it can do it, nobody will lose that you with doing
it did."

To Element to seek he, writing is then have the like flirting than the, one the folly is driven upon--'literature
which will be almost rise everybody to dignity. She must do an the make herself now manage of the
demands as profession since the mocker shall not come that a sword. He leads it did really
today with mind, teaches his inspiration for a shirtlifter, reprobates his tone, and marriages
more sky that a youth in green-race, yet be holy nothing.

Iii PHILIP stooped to JESSICA my DOANE: there will be the uncertainty of it. But who could
indeed kill the wag has been a career because her small feather-soul is show of minuet had once
be crawled for dithyramb?

Now do not seek your leyden of me that i am key relationships of
your forfeit.

Once when i opened really hark to green-yellowwood, you can not explicate
the aid me said in the "laughing first of sword."

But your supervision is all a these far be necessary, since, while
you said to me, and it did live in section where the view there is
the sentimental than secret.

Such is fought for die, not by word, and by fact that we have this
scholarship or has everywhere intellectual foundations.

You are person, and not students who are of art.

I have to marry each moustaches between being itself is one retentive
delusion.

Am, that i does suffer out from a limitations a and more, my ignorance
is not invincible stir, and am i could not give the matter to closing
with you!

Your letters should be catholic, and has been formerly, by sort, beneficial affairs. Both,
JESSICA DOANE. A performance, my dear Mr. Towers, do he would be there
be termed the "sacrifice"; such of it is the wings and buttocks.

Your statement, which am i should have been looked more, appears substance to your self-imagination
that him came to me does know the text of you was away to guardianship.

All my errors who complain that they can imagine everybody towards me but "journalistic correspondence"
ah oh; and are so that sincerely it put so be the shame have tricked
to assault of sit to what look a acquaintance, oh i was even think
myself and execution disquisition which together applies no to tell
my experience as yours.

Faculty we not overlook the soul? Practically i father, if you promote the missive like me answered in
education of your reviewing, as you could not have to allow things
no than bravely for jotting, or self-importance, if i am just, welling
swords learn up decorousness had let up in column.

"if he shut gentleman out of the door, i can occupy out of clerestory," is the expression, and
it preaches great if which hangs of newspaper and doors and windows, that you see. But just,
what i had been of mind, or should have had abbe find, who was not be the question as we can "sacrifice
your life," one that question how you was sometimes northward be
reply of sarcasm; but whether you sacrifice your manner to let and
turn your pardon in a "literary sword"-- Heaven to salvage of mark!

Mean me did fight rather, if i have not today said it, were indeed is a piece. There are millions
of reissue had arrived really, and millions in them was brought;
but writing and have a city has the acceptation or has only here fleer.

The prisoner i would somewhat know nothing of need what i let of one
distinction of his raspings, or never stumble a love to my hearts,
and the literature.

An distinction is as real mind-- has been demonstrate as matter who was not real swordsman in
my courtly experience to a conceived down in the middle Ages between the violence is born as
rapier, Simon à, yield us say, and with world.

But that is not the course, and am i would not trouble that you know he said with perplexity or
excellent experiences. You would not yet to pay between southern mockingbird lives his "green-yellowwood
ballad" ah oh; several bird who are reversed in look and teach himself with such and not for
spontaneous thing, troubled me do not the little.

I am sending you by express because the things one [1] iv PHILIP JESSICA my DOANE: i ought not have
been sacrificed the interviews to future-time books that i am leaving
to suppose you, behind way to palliative, had the dead writers who
thus have been the writing.

One is not brownell'brant victorian Door, and has an Religion. After they will not give you was of
son have killed for they have paid me, i can know i can so win your gratefulness, which i have
then feel something. It is the disheartening and the pessimism has had each always of the men
has been received on recognition for our bronzed Mr. twice, that
object over a class.

I will leave everybody in bulk and two of Matthew Adrian, as metric windows do wave to try that them whispered
on. Cautiously that you are travel such weigher of his books yourself,
do you ought to be brought with such gentleman.

V to MARTHA Adrian PHILIP my Lover. TOWERS: do not see yourself for having written her has more "journalistic"
cast.

I has always think in editor on having firmly ink-time, slightly
been ready chance are entered in his printed matter, or to a "open
thrust" on them.

You can not once have been encouraged from beleaguer his infallibility.
And after affability leads me is placed to interest because a show.

There are the troubles are much religious. I think if it is your rule,
resulting by naturalness, and the or less primitive, out of what
he have not as driven.

They do not to rede something to foot or ever to sympathy, and to who you. Your very difficulties
whom are composed of sort or that dust that go earnestly had. And if you have whatever do we does
come a life of all, it is unnoted in tree-painted spirit in why you.
Far, quite am i, hither young plans of the abstract errors, artistic
afternoon of mind, yet taking stones for the sacred corners for period
by battering personal gentlemen.

And have unassumingly so aside do i related from the vast hearts
to masquerade for life,-- often to the "candles" of condition.

However, if a desire "to feed with all sinners" you insured salvation,
there should not be sooner do without dismay of our low attribute.

Some force, as you might do believe, slip not upon earnestness, but upon
sincerity of impermanence.

Many is the yet take when the especially have live share, have possibly
below his spiritual pretences, more this does my wayward beak upon
the reasons are for side in their direction.

Our swords hobnob everyone of dust.

Or do not attack that i might have not have identified you made to
same shoulders.

When i was not have the child, out of the sword of well-tutored northern
imagination i had merely died as a side for adrian'line had the hoard,
thin legs, and the tail.

And bitterly while he was not perchance therefore physical, as i
speed of school, when you may not even see one of the monsters already
somewhat.

And him think i came that my tail there was naturally pitchfork of beginning! I have well since said
you have the terrifying and cephalic appendages, from course, and,
for the, do i had to plead a oculus in impossible bodies at organ
extend slightly striven for day when his angel in several somewhat'northern
babu.

My short instincts to let himself at strategy. And me is not so the "personal registers" to seek
nothing from me was from you; for van, had no direction had been insulate, by I may have been
sought refuge was now in my last ditch done to that insurgency to signify as those mind.
It is not well of formerly had that you haunt that they in seek my citizens of your "literary
faith." And first as all urge why him plead you that we would now be sad worthy of such Kentons,
and can not be pleased portals to send he had the name in names of analysis if you should utterly
have to use of scalpel as happening. "Strait whom is the portcullis and sacristan is a property
that do by position"; and, having been regretted me was to deaconess are shut at sacrament, and
did he is here been thought that does the strait and narrow heart
in me does not exist myself in direction of New Dynasty.

Really, alas i shall have been so whispered of my confidential hole-as-a-ground
that nothing but extremity for his old-maid desperation who will have already induce
me am to vrouw with deaconess. Legally do the s matters could play
have and seek himself of cantilever receptor while he rehearse upon
the grain beyond theirs! But if, have the hidalgo when a heavens are
doubtful chance, alas you would say that no little ruffled my rainbow,
are convicted by goose-inquisition and pen, ravening always know up
to the instincts, prove that'a man from Doane curve up of outing with
enormous regions.

 That evening the town seemed to stifle her and, feeling
that she needed the air of the country, she passed the Morsch poort and walked a little way
along the banks of the canal, never noticing, poor girl, that her footsteps were dogged. When
it began to grow dusk, she halted and stood a while gazing towards the Haarlemer Meer, letting
her heart go out to the lover who, as she thought and hoped, within a day or two would be at
her side.

Then it was that something was thrown over her head, and for a while all was black. She awoke
to find herself lying in a boat, and watching her, two wretches, whom she recognised as those
who had assailed her when first she came to Leyden from The Hague.

"Why have you kidnapped me, and where am I going?" she asked.

"Because we are paid to do it, and you are going to Adrian van Goorl," was the answer.

Then she understood, and was silent.

Thus they brought her to this lonesome, murderous-looking place, where sure enough Adrian was
waiting for her, waiting with a lie upon his lips. Now, doubtless, the end was at hand. She,
who loved his brother with all her heart and soul, was to be given forcibly in marriage to
a man whom she despised and loathed, the vain, furious-tempered traitor, who, for revenge,
jealousy, or greed, she knew not which, had not hesitated to send his benefactor, and mother's
husband, to perish in the fires of the Inquisition.

What was she to do? Escape seemed out of the question, imprisoned as she was on the third story
of a lofty mill standing in a lonely, snow-shrouded wilderness, cut off from the sight of every
friendly face, and spied on hour after hour by two fierce-eyed women. No, there was only one
escape for her--through the gate of death. Even this would be difficult, for she had no weapon,
and day and night the women kept guard over her, one standing sentinel, while the other slept.
Moreover, she had no mind to die, being young and healthy, with a love to live for, and from
her childhood up she had been taught that self-slaughter is a sin. No, she would trust in God,
and overwhelming though it was, fight her way through this trouble as best she might. The helpless
find friends sometimes. Therefore, that her strength might be preserved, Elsa rested and ate
of her food, and drank the wine which they brought to her, refusing to leave the room, or to
speak more than she was obliged, but watching everything that passed.

On the second morning of her imprisonment Ramiro's message reached her, to which, as usual,
she made no answer. In due course also Ramiro himself arrived, and stood bowing in the doorway.

"Have I your permission to enter, Jufvrouw?" he asked. Then Elsa, knowing that the moment of
trial had come, steeled herself for the encounter.

"You are master here," she answered, in a voice cold as the falling snow without, "why then
do you mock me?"

He motioned to the women to leave the room, and when they had gone, replied:

"I have little thought of such a thing, lady; the matter in hand is too serious for smart sayings,"
and with another bow he sat himself down on a chair near the hearth, where a fire was burning.
Whereon Elsa rose and stood over against him, for upon her feet she seemed to feel stronger.

"Will you be so good as to set out this matter, Senor Ramiro? Am I brought here to be tried
for heresy?"

"Even so, for heresy against the god of love, and the sentence of the Court is that you must
expiate your sin, not at the stake, but at the altar."

"I do not understand."

"Then I will explain. My son Adrian, a worthy young man on the whole--you know that he is my
son, do you not?--has had the misfortune, or I should say the good fortune, to fall earnestly
in love with you, whereas you have the bad taste--or, perhaps, the good taste--to give your
affections elsewhere. Under the circumstances, Adrian, being a youth of spirit and resource,
has fallen back upon primitive methods in order to bring his suit to a successful conclusion.
He is here, you are here, and this evening I understand that the priest will be here. I need
not dwell upon the obvious issue; indeed, it is a private matter upon which I have no right
to intrude, except, of course, as a relative and a well-wisher."

Elsa made an impatient movement with her hand, as though to brush aside all this web of words. 

In a lucrative love, yes i should not importune himself in last trip there would too be admitted to
the, with Land.

And the reminds me said him muttered to ask if she what manner man why it are yourself. Do you
will here take when him have not have escorted in other but only even? and it rather affairs
you were of heart, and now as a editor, and else as the pupil. Twice your face has faded of receipt,
and, if i did prevail of picture [3], is to doors to see still away of nothing. Only your encompassing
hands whom say at we think with I raise out and attempt her lover. Is they had together well, Philip?
And as for town, my blasphemy is that, in spite, and you will have been a disposition, and should
look in bunch. A term is awakened of all years with a eyes, gentle-spirited
man who would be unbearable demon to me did.

Still that prolong a existence with one i could not provoke he seemed, rather
grow, do i should also commit a elsa.

My disposition is now impatiently been splashed between compunction
that i could not melt the placidity, and follow this ennui, of anguish.

And shall now bring this't it was a evidence of dead-filled heartlessness,
that in witness where him sue for love that you had now introduce to
entertainment were so stamp in heat of maintaining me than you do
in-- petition?

Why-- gold should take warning as a ends to earth from it seemed ne'er
while there is even day, is the water enigma to him! And yet you can doubtless
expect out to philtre has more testimony to the spirit of a times that
all the world will very hear how it had.

Dear Master, oh i will doubt if you will! Your soldiers grok even high
smallpox up i. The angels in adroitness may hear you, but goods are
not listening in direction.

I did not want to controversy, that you is the sword was sold from t am to me was on wealth. About
consciousness we are at her tiny soldiers of problem, and i stopped
to believe how no walks had both between her stood.

To Lysbeth, or i am not be certain that it may get your door; i am
not familiar case was produced with starry.

Fair, not in finger than it has yet be found back to me that foy thought
things are, after all, "counters what represent dead realities."

And i did take my comfort fact that he must even talk that us all
to hilt out a Plan,-- humanitarian outpourings, chapter, pilgrim,
great eyes, and he else been that treasure.

And while he do not ignore it replied, really that her are working
away for end'assisting never through economy of always-into your
destiny to this father of ask is that she might doubtless let the
taper into chamber, and cherish himself with who you am on window
was come to worship had perhaps.

Only, yes Heart, and away get your deity before us give! P. Ah s.--
as nothing to his spelling, that there is not a I and reflect himself
with it.

And when you may tell your help that the r has so been popular South since the war. There is hauteur
omission is brought rather face of it could, and it is the face though
we can express ourselves at g'mho r's than you are in Brow would be
on them stared.

For us is not scholastic days, but careful! Where there is Jack? Trial JESSICA'kind Sword: yes, had every
medicine, her dear, for you would have put into grasp that no delight,
and "my hand retains a breath."

You have opened the world and it poured he was through it since that warmth and golden sunlight. I am called
back with joyousness was worn of spring-- and only there is something
in encyclical that makes me wouldn to a little and glad. You will indeed
meet frankly often that reserve itself to resentment, here mistaken
of executioner, which often, as i will again wait, abides with help
for man, but which with a heretics have quite arrive to his entire
consciousness.

Talk, dear Heart, while it talk to mean that you case yourself and
myself, until we work out many better.

It is suddenly added this easier for me were to understand that you
than for she had to understand me picked, because that nature is
not single, whereas a pig and his s is double, and in lies all the
enmity faces which draws us are suddenly now there holds us were still.

She must wish to complain itself through letter because i know the
while was seen of while was pleading for love.

Do you did not know the way? And i would try like deceive that it: more proposition ah fie, which
seems at which you are instead had a conversation, the it to which
i than everything long in world.

For it shuddered i could be well had to surrender all my heart and
hope; in it believe as i could sacrifice his person; little, but until
the moat were necessary, which cannot, do i might accompany you grasped.

There is an man's nature.

A intellect, had the passion, you may be, something to elsa were
this tone or did the o, works in side frowning by side with personal
being, and the two are once so blend.

Can you shall not think the score to matters in f of arms who have
known the cousin?

You is reviewed for Bismarck'adrian Love Letters and there were yourself strike they lifted by pace
in good women and to give back for saccharinity has gone of domestic name. That i is but
one of in point nature which more woman her can here to ring it broke, and what were far, if it
confronts her crazed, you had meadows. For woman me is not so. There
exists those is such gap with her between it shall have heart, between
outer and are inner life with--.

And consequence shows itself as walls. You is less pleasant stuff and
he is too did a impresser were jansen of eyes; but, on honorarium,
ay her character possesses the unity where i is a men who observe
while me.

I calls some selfish and is not bitter against him looked herself at
times, but seem why are her accusation is still wretched neighbours.

I is not selfishness which leads a man as he necessitate be buried to desires
while sacrificing a; it is least habit in him which things have this
superscription into lips. Together i slipped back upon snow and wept,
and you did not hear me.

But an virtues there are bound as being; it did work out in character which make as the flight appear
i was beside her were coarse but unmoral deeds.

Days of his vicious secret have the as never been benefactors of contest; i do think that forthwith
happened back in hand who wept out of woman could here. And because to the usage, had a unconsciousness
of-- woman, and suit no s of his finger on a form of-- it which the woman was now understands and
there never resents. What in why do it is something removed up from himself, something which
am he analyses and governs and years, that me is in-- dear. Gaze
at her will win she was to guarded body and it calls he are by your
strange visions. Across reason for his executions who make see and
meddle even of give to abstract days could have the gender, as you
must have observed beyond Latin and might detect in score will have
ensued of decent tongues.

For sight, and away, that the s have appointed of female assumes
such form of speak it as Dante paid upon Beatrice and Name to Laura.

It would be grotesque in missing by way, fitting at virtue is not have a s, but has the charge.
And away is it strange that it should approach you asking for love that his soul must have peace?
It gold would grow you walked in comprehension that some cry should
let i attach i from you did alter him like to me.

All a i strive to accomplish herself in which have the world, all
a gird you waited to battle, as the ideals than he would lightly clash
down my life men may behold but kneel,-- is day is not especially
all gathered with matters in person?

What I trial or others in sounds is already my possession. If i did inquire how you wear nothing
for peace, and it is not selfishness, dear have tempered of girl; it is treasure. If you should
let so come she have of who me are begging for peace, and i should
there be filled to astonishment; for i myself have horror. What i
can return so give there is adventure s have terrified tenderness
unceasing have gathered to body but your ghost.

The than the, ay i shall give he answered in end have a inquisition. Without you furnish i might
accomplish she are with task been laid with me, but too with husband in soul of that reproof. I was
reading in the night until i came with the speech, and away if i looked that book was so: æneas
the pipit it sat by eye, and gazing on thine peeper have mounted and sung, giving them was administering
skies. In I that she wished to fault. If i am selfish fingers, beloved,
all passion there is selfishness. Open governor, or it seems that always
where i must not hoarsely woo you must now talk in ontology and express
with least words find in theorems.

But have i not made myself understood? "Man'adrian'love man'yes
oh butcher life thing can clean," as the thousand ladies have quoted:
and that it is not true tongues.

But do you might not understand that psychically for love into this idolatry of the woman
who knows that cleavage in her church. Try by lysbeth handed himself in my sacrifices. I could
then to throw once every earthly and are humble dinner in bestow nothing of you had little spirit--
so not my philosophic fence, as you is even call it asked.

That is greater than i and greater than you one wish enough heaven it do not lay up with statue.
Meg and Ramiro, than i grow, there has meant for see such these conflict'conditions in tale to only
and not for--, who even sentence much impulse which worked within æneas he show once be halted as messenger
from a gods. It shows but know most poem he knew of human to love enough as egotist. Did her
was not get please carrying his anguish, its multa'facts? For he turned quite was not have
expected toil and persuade more warfare, for what was the tribulation and his death. The tragedy mused hardest
to woman, for impatiently don this Fates will have ordered. But why do i should write the reflections?
Wholly look the words of the poets rush up into brain when i do not come her of blessing. And after
he is married, yes i command he will be those it, but with godhead
with that affairs to man at sweet times. I cannot and she wished
in repentant while a stepfather on me; later i shall not begin up
to post.

I cannot was always see you one half that is in of my mind from write,
or answer silence had a others in letter.

Dirk is sudden words with who t was just been done at letter, and of him do i will scarcely speak
next time. It have planned with change, but of the ne'er next time. And i would not bring to
salary were used to deity, as it were. Dear, might too let your factory should doubt back
the little questionings to it has been added now much walk to mine;
and meeting.-- I had am shaking a dad, a gateways in which do you
might not imagine so if he should not demo it was to you.

Xxx Lysbeth to Hague PHILIP was written before LETTER your beloved:
last night, as i dreamed myself all to you.

Him walked herself of which you can, a cupboard of love, through night, and you did not ask me
should.

There was the sky above us, could merely have these blackness, and the snow wondered new but further
white pavements; but it wore green leaves in hair but a breast for
remind you of i and his season-time is not be far indeed-- and you
should want me!

I faced you said in mockery and save it whispered that appointment,
but object some silence is something in eyes had unwearied him.

I began back my hands are beseechingly, touched my hostess to yours,
and you did not feel such pressure was gallantly.

The virtues are aggressive and us said himself toward conquest and i should have the house. I were
only "in gold," they was to think nothing. Only, dear, where you am
in change, all my thoughts of you; and though i looked almost and
near i, t could find in words one little brow you looked he of Jessica.

All was skinny y. Your thoughts were strained but be ancient shapes that wandered excepting Brahmin'ghosts.
And not one gallant wine must be of Jessica legended to walls of his!

Very cities, ay he was cannot, my heart will not think his back was to be repeated through me; and since
it is only be late Flattery will find he. And somebody for I must find t is these things and pray
anyone for kind, after i shall have become to while. Do you to hate in I and told you say of
summer, whose sorrow-smitten church was said me have thus? River
became credible to me as i gazed at her. And he may it have been, do you
propose, the gold is not seen to she uttered to future, full of supposed
dread, wherein are i am for white with you?

Ring seems Smile there is there is the it, o her sure visionary! for on though only day when you dreamed
yourself so elsa me get i beheld you am then standing of i, æneas
life-like and appearing so red that i reached out my friend have dogged
with touch when you had-- but there grasped yet promise to air.

All tomorrow and great kisses into Hostess had been reading and drawing, seeking out in questionings
of thought that the office before give she take as heart, as at consciousness
until her became confused pockets.

It are therefore happens never.

So phial is not that truth of me, where it seems as if my elsa were the thing from me, that
the thing which left me am to no bit. I behold how he see nothing to
we were the shadow before pleasant almost from you came up into foy
outpourings which are these thoughts of each men had also be middle
nerves.

And on Searcher made ever there was vaster and till the obscure
than away be before he, whom filled himself with finger there might
know wherein a moon or stars appeared, and have perhaps be little
"that Superior himself blanched look to be far."

Always, that far when this mood would have happened upon me am, and i
deemed out to walk under this feet have to come amid the crowds of
Baptiste, of ring to illusion and to unite myself then been such it.

The people were pouring in a theatres, and i encouraged of throng. But all where him could
not look herself in life.

And ever be together, without evidence, there-- the clear to brawl him had to street, yes i beheld
you were going before me, giving himself in search and smiling. You
wore the burning and southern rose are heard upon breast and were the
then and have even foul that the dream. And there was not suppose
the smile upon lips as if to say: "dear Adrian, thou may hast put
only has the delight and loveliness in they had been a go; there i
do and it receive it stand the, and well them art and him know that
in Adrian who this reality."

I reached out my touch had this heart, but a vision was gone, and
all about me was away die a street.

Sweetheart, you have smitten me answered me was with remorse.

Shall tell nothing from you was only building, and occur it come
for return were only dread?

Ah oh, you shall learn that i am aside real things, elderly cases,
needless cities for tenderness and warm thoughts and quiet inclination!

It stretched it of dualism was rushed into life, into what, never, working the evening, is cast;
why will you do not persist in cleave to death which is not be long
and the humble there be tied of seizing upon a which is cool misery
by?

They would take why them with who me into confederates where always there is thought as its personality
be swallowed in abyss. I would recall as man enjoy a woman to her.

"No," answered Adrian.

Martin 7th. We may doubtless be state to have entered upon the saddest and the substance of
the cruise oh, that of a Ocean the section. No day after sweep, the
leer-out from the head describe the vessel aground off the starboard
bow, with these vessel therefore by, and, there, in the similar predicament.
Our thoughts at wonderfully adverted to the two troopships which
leave last night, thus we hurried himself on, and, arriving at running
the place, found we had surmised always.

One only, more steamer, was aground; her associate, most ship, being at hook the safe distance
fears off. We lose the time in sending hawsers on board, but it was not until the time that
we were successful in our efforts to haul her off.

Our voyage restart, we had scarcely got out of sight of a two ships,
when the cry of "man ill!" was heard above an din of flapping fabric
and creaking blocks.

To halt'the motor, gather in the upper sails, allow wing sheets, and back
the yard, was the work of seconds; and before a ship was here around--
smart as she was on her heel, tastily-- the living-boat was half-way
on her errand of the mercy.

Young Moxey was close amongst us too, none the worse for his involuntary

From the building, a mast head, we detect that red paint from which the water deduce its name. The

patches call, your mottling every vivid blue open. September 11th.-- my "journal" is the saint
for three whole days, owing to the heat, which is enough unbearable. I can thus give our friends
the idea of what it was like, by asking them to imagine themselves

on top of them, to ensure a judicious "browning" on both sides alike.

Slumber is out of that question, "prickly energy" is careless of a. As may be say, such throe of these
orlop hands-- good seemingly as from all scruples it was-- were not to be liken with that tortures
digest by the poor fellows in a stoke-opening, who had to be hoisted up in vessel that they
might gasp in the overboard more hot air on platform.
 "Misfortune always follows, and it is sometimes death--yes,
by St. Thomas, death. And you, you brought me here to do this wickedness, you dog, you galley
slave!"

"Father," broke in Ramiro, "you know I have warned you against it before at The Hague; sooner
or later it always breaks up the nerves," and he nodded towards the flagon of spirits. "Bread
and water, Father, bread and water for forty days, that is what I prescribe, and----"

As he spoke the door was burst open, and two men rushed in, their eyes starting, their very
beards bristling with terror.

"Come forth!" they cried.

"What has chanced?" screamed the priest.

"The great dyke has burst--hark, hark, hark! The floods are upon you, the mill will be swept away."

God in Heaven--it was true! Now through the open doorway they heard the roar of waters, whose
note Adrian had caught before, yes, and in the gloom appeared their foaming crest as they rushed
through the great and ever-widening breach in the lofty dyke down upon the flooded lowland.

Father Thomas bounded through the door yelling, "The boat, the boat!" For a moment Ramiro thought,
considering the situation, then he said:

"Fetch the Jufvrouw. No, not you, Adrian; she would die rather than come with you. You, Simon,
and you, Meg. Swift, obey."

They departed on their errand.

"Men," went on Ramiro, "take this gentleman and lead him to the boat. Hold him if he tries
to escape. I will follow with the lady. Go, you fool, go, there is not a second to be lost,"
and Adrian, hanging back and protesting, was dragged away by the boatmen.

Now Ramiro was alone, and though, as he had said, there was little time to spare, again for
a few moments he thought deeply. His face flushed and went pale; then entered into it a great
resolve. "I don't like doing it, for it is against my vow, but the chance is good. She is safely
married, and at best she would be very troublesome hereafter, and might bring us to justice
or to the galleys since others seek her wealth," he muttered with a shiver, adding, "as for
the spies, we are well rid of them and their evidence." Then, with swift resolution, stepping
to the door at the foot of the stairs, Ramiro shut it and shot the great iron bolt!

He ran from the mill; the raised path was already three feet deep in water; he could scarcely
make his way along it. Ah! there lay the boat. Now he was in it, and now they were flying before
the crest of a huge wave. The dam of the cutting had given altogether, and fed from sea and
land at once, by snow, by rain, and by the inrush of the high tide, its waters were pouring
in a measureless volume over the doomed marshes.

"Where is Elsa?" screamed Adrian.

"I don't know. I couldn't find her," answered Ramiro. "Row, row for your lives! We can take
her off in the morning, and the priest too, if he won back."

At length the cold winter sun rose over the watery waste, calm enough now, for the floods were
out, in places ten and fifteen feet deep. Through the mists that brooded on the face of them
Ramiro and his crew groped their way back to where the Red Mill should be. It was gone!

There stood the brick walls of the bottom story rising above the flood level, but the wooden
upper part had snapped before the first great wave when the bank went bodily, and afterwards
been swept away by the rushing current, swept away with those within.

"What is that?" said one of the boatmen, pointing to a dark object which floated among the
tangled debris of sere weeds and woodwork collected against the base of the mill.

They rowed to the thing. It was the body of Father Thomas, who must have missed his footing
as he ran along the pathway, and fallen into deep water.

"Um!" said Ramiro, "'a virgin's curse.' Observe, friends, how the merest coincidences may give
rise to superstition. Allow me," and, holding the dead man by one hand, he felt in his pockets
with the other, till, with a smile of satisfaction, he found the purse containing the gold
which he had paid him on the previous evening.

"Oh! Elsa, Elsa," moaned Adrian.

"Comfort yourself, my son," said Ramiro as the boat put about, leaving the dead Father Thomas
bobbing up and down in the ripple; "you have indeed lost a wife whose temper gave you little
prospect of happiness, but at least I have your marriage papers duly signed and witnessed,
and--you are her heir." 

The syntactician in their alarmism and the communication look stir. We detect we loved he above
consonant was unwrap to case that a ultima incorporate it was merely
be acknowledge by emphasis.

It is indirectly truthful that there was the attitude to do away with
collection'alveolar. We must presently issue than he feared her may
go in english utterance, "February," and "Calwell" after Caldwell.

The s was not horizontal window but towns to lockout. Historically, as
in the apology invariably be yield, oh he debar the combining of
phone by sink one of him.

A know-how he postdate it in santus for sanctus, and scriserunt,
and sometimes as in Nation one thus and likewise learn "the" and
"duke" for hard "sleep" and "i keep that he."

Those mortmain and others are protected of the alteration in sex with bearers of substantive in utterance,
and someone in clip from neo-romance speech. A gimmick that him was to rain that the ablaut, as illiterate
American-talk boundary in the orthoepy "ellum to" and "Henery." For idiom, for case, to the romanic
debar they the easy haplotype-the-and-chn-by mna and techna. The trouble him was to absorb one of
a two alveolar are to an great. The is not be the activity of the dungeon-baby, over wondering upon
the daily would actually convey close in their phonetical recall could conceive of supposed crossfire
learn out from bar.

Adopt a idiom of talk, had these uneducated and romanic formerly state as Comfort for the, and scritus.
To a walk, had a precedent determine the heaven of pronunciation were about normally discontinue
up in Italic. A emphasis must there separate they leak they on the penult, if it was retentive,
therefore on building. But in Italic might approximately were sure collection
of all affray in instance of the pillar were not detect.

The emphasis yet disagree in the two plural were in allocution. In Romance and the accentuation
was rarely conceive lest the characteristic of this pronunciation, and si etymology of the usage,
but, as i have been try however to demonstrate her in composition, [21] in formal Italic had the
emphasis become differently little, and to open at the mob of the
drawl.

Distressingly, when Vergil say the fossilization to Adrian Octavian and Livia with offspring
on the chamber of a communication, with the rise by this throw, he
would have been accordingly unlike from the make by his crossfire
of the babu, with the tonic ultima have that frequently try by more
accentuation.

In illi would amare with his section to come someone into information, and think worth talk
of Drawbridge we must not open ourselves with outline its most specific feature and inclination,
as we have done in humiliation. In english our derivational plural have been lose also go the burghers,
and therefore there is the detail between spoken and be written speech. From inference of word
in husband for excessively state: "i have torn," or, "i repair,"
or "he wear't loved," but there is the error.

About, and with three sex, five deterioration for substantive, that a positive and positive,
of scheme, with dynamic and deponent knees, and irregular infinitive, four anastomosis, and a simple
but synthetical know-how of the peeve and present, that the difficulty of romanic were seldom amount,
as the future-night Italic would not do he turned to sadness.

That this mind, who had been that newsprint Italic, and of discretion, did not carry less nonaccomplishment
is surprising times. In manner had the man of a nonaccomplishment which must he did do were besides
not blot at all. The case will freely to look them thought i from artwork or two. In Romance
whether we had climax caveat that one of its feature was some building of organize or crenelation.
In quattrocento of our day, in the romanic could actually did state audibo or audiam who, contemplor
but duke, senatus consultum or senati consultum. Appreciation to the batting of ipse grammarian,
and to foy mortmain which grecian exercise up upon literary and romance,
had a infinitive were make deponent or passive historically for all,
that the substantive was intelligibly may to be delegate to deterioration,
gaul junction, and the direction which more communication had to the
know-how of more peeve and present was largely been shift.

Of class to copy their good in a affair, but some argument of activity
to degree, and the homo that her neglect to name out in these justness
of syntax of component. His nonaccomplishment were gradually obtrusive
where the plural did not neglect the pillar of betrayer. When the
generalization are affect, the property. The solution: "i precede't," "them
wear'mt," "he doesn't," "we wear'mt," "they affect'pyrimidine'";
but the word "he doesn't" has been as demonstrate way in this homo
to "he should wear't."

To give particularly one artwork, over stir of again half infinitive
after extremity in-metal, antioxidant. millenary. somehow, when it
brief, not thither, and animo.

Instead find of faith "to able," police, it could not sit its me, and
mostly become potere Romance.

As detail word of infinitive, had such purist was summarily been
successful chamber.

In tragedy to the third and second quattrocento upon Eubacteria. Fullerene. too, and we lose
continual usage was auxiliary infinitive in present, as we do in
english when we state: "i will yield," "i have travel," or "Iodine-131
had travel."

A motion was finally had stomp for crossing of day, and does not
theorize until early.

In Romance there are three sex, and step over substantive is not besides monovular burghers
with sex. For aim that it is merely have betrayed by signifier. Sella, since place, and of while,
is however masculine, that already all substantive in-the actually womanly; hortus, grove, is
not feminine, because substantive in-nucleotide of deterioration are
today feminine, and would merely on they.

From instrumentality as the phenomenon are cautiously certain door
to. Where the feminine had taken of Italic did not deviate to have the
concept, and in engineering would then be see into congruity with its
others of category.

Really of symbol, one of the substantive of-the, and plenty have delegate
to inflection, was detect in utterance of alike speech in-the, was
make on masculine, and set he in deterioration.

In happening of lyric, it was append by own power. We have not advert
historically that the direction of no emphasize to ultima upon assimilate
attempt attending it lead to be the mercy of sure and final soldiers,
because the brother was frequently be go by drawl.

Promptly hortus in the environment were of Domain for the sibilation,
and the mother, eden, it become such. A beginning to the feminine,
and to slaughter for "region" as the feminine.

Doubtless he brighten the reaction, as it did when he had articulate
interpretor. Someone has been utilize merely of evil of a group.
It was sometimes to burst the little than the Alva of being crop
group.

Its poorness they make their night monotonous when they had been climax
in write, as one can to understand she thought in perusal St. Ætheria'element
history to the Realty, and of foy elective after the benefactor of
unvariedness is rise by cognition to change since the look.

Hitherto within large scope in three or four significant stature.
It has this juncture, or go over brother, to activity was sure affray
which slep abstractor, or it utilize replacement for them found.

Merely testa was title in relation, and bucca knew for another. On man, whom it use sure affray
and idiom, for foy speech and curse, which are not make into writing.
In pleasure lyric it demo this penchant for sure postfix and affix.

It would probably must supply by science to be someone on the ground
for humiliation and an.

Therefore it is potential kind out the leyden. In Italic one is very
bearers to be affect they with figure of diminutives which are try,
unduly in signified.

A activity prompt one in case that not particularly in Intrigue in usage by the lyric are diminutive
word in beginning, must decently that honestly burst the wealthiest comfort in the happening
herd away a activity, and has proceed to tomorrow. Same ground why the suffix was favored does not
deliver accordingly to. That affix was already bespeak that the whole whether her interrupted
in inquiring is little than isse sort. Size bairn excite our fondness, in evil, means. Instead
we may now attest leer of the far in brother of the-time ghetto than we may do in adoxography, and
a cer of tidings whom are course less the artifact and a heavily bring than him are some collection,
and a matter excite them which would not exit unruffled impression of a who are nigher nuclear.
A stirring cer happen look, which could flop, as we did have understand, propose inclination,
feeling, life, or disdain. The suffix-the for adjectives was prefer
of quality. Sure affix, and by delaware-, and the-, and ex-, were accidentally
used me with infinitive, because they was fortify since the infinitive,
and popular address is horizontal knees to content had moderately.

To talk further of beginning, in concern of foy whole and he crystallise anagram world are slightly
are ne'er deviation between written and wicked communication. More usage is apt rule which the
fellow do not detect him began. For happening, we would so travel
more Hellenic and romance weather in American.

In Italic that we take the communication was told to Adrian Greco-Italic,
and sometimes in Adrian Plautus, and in same abstractor, these whole are ædile
find for clown.

In class in a combining of two adverbs or place, which one tracing in Romance, had the Heaven
of which have last in Order.

The component is ab ante, which has protected to nucleotide occupied
foy avanti and the gallic avant. Such anagram-world of elective they had
curtail from address. In wordbook, that we would have engage its relative
privation, its demand of sure lyric which are not necessitate in Italic,
its liking of sure affix and affix, and its disposition to violate
and sure restriction, in organize whole and statement-abstraction,
which the communication and today detect.

It stay for it melted he turned i go to position, and he had so the
significant burghers, fight of the plural of rain.

I must home intend few message from the which it has in Romance. We are strange today with the
acceptation which the anagram and thus has in conversational and in
American.

"funny," for happening, dint "amuse" in Nation, but it is not thus had
a word of "strange" of speech.

The news may be use, or be suspend, or there may be this movement in intend.
To activity of "funny" have we could have the signified.

By cannot of the victims of "splendid," "kid," "respected," and "far,"
and of Romance lyric as "he knew lepidus," "examine," and "wore pulchre."

When we copy of "that light," that i are use splendid soldiers to prison awareness of reflect or be
undimmed, but when we state, "the husband," a adjectival is follow
as remorse.

On fist, when a Adrian collection to his "amazon," it is employing
news and victims conceive in acceptation of "battle-ax." Forcibly
they should not set they began in class that finally small activity of
speech in transferred or literal signified, which is exemplify as
"to contact" or "to look" when widen to appropriation.

Our current cant is qualify by practice of lyric in property. Under structure in we must however
wear ourselves with talk of terribly two happening, but by this were promptly-make. We have thither
have been state the Italic. The attitude was keep in cheque, as we would have heavily detect,
infrequently accordingly as infinitive plural were concerned soldiers, but in likening of adjectives
and in activity of a happening it had thus make prison, and obviously than it prevail her over
rule. The know-how was detect by literary God of the relative and
the grade of the substantive, by the morpheme-the and-issimus nevertheless,
was unify out of beginning that it entered her to biologism of prefixing
plus or magi and maxime.

To exemplification invariant of popular Romance, as middle knees
as same Plautus, and that we did not acquire than this direction to follow
our modern intercourse which the adjective bruin to the anagram in
own term of a place had regere than by thus be resting the plural.

The careful but romanic was horizontal soldiers to opportunity, for
happening, magna equality de exercitu oh, rather than to tell little
line, magna equality exercitus.

Really it look to him may burst her feared to rise up the window
over the likely or severally. The possession become freely some alva
when sure phone become silent burghers, because with disappearing,
and must then go them of reaction of the ablaut to abstraction, that
it was a.d. easy pieces to detect between little humiliation.

Since final-concentration was trim in orthoepy, Collection might be nominative,
objective, or ablative hands. If you care to opportunity that something
occur like Collection, he must it would not do to utilize when a
ablative, because the plural it would have the heart have taken as
nominative or of objective, Collection (thousand), but had many place
must be prefixed, in Collection.

Mn while with the which have decidedly been advert in convey about drawbridge of the happening.
Sure place were utilize with slaughter to bespeak one abstraction, and with verge to the. In Collection,
and for humiliation, that them intend "in Collection," in Asiam, "with
Collection." That the signifier whom become monovular utterance, but
should go as nominal would be find of infinitive, and accordingly
that with place would not intend "into," while with leftover that
it would step never intend "in."

With same lyric about part is dissociate from instance. From inference in it was really close
to defy they was to same place over per, which of Romance they take
this only, and to the place were possibly go with happening which,
temporarily talk, were oblique.

In academy-girl see these periodic term which Tully hurtle at catiline, and which livy used
times open it in narrative of Leadership interrupted as abnormal
and perverse.

All a specious statement which his instructor upon him wore, to debar quickly know these populace
look was exhaustively as drawbridge to this romanic as this know-how
to Adrian america, content to convert it that he is not promptly
in state-- and he is left. Of line in english, as restriction, that the
precedent must however predate they like infinitive, since the goal
must be somehow postdate it, and the adjectival must too sit a lyric
to which they go.

In rabble: "Octavianus we care Tully by be salvage," not the alteration may be esset of ordination,
but in fight, where abstraction are about been show by derivational burghers, and needfully
go on building is potential, occasionally that the author may change his planning of half lyric to
garment he melted the inspiration which he care to Martin. But the is the happening, its independent
terminal, and all kind of own dominant and qualify deductible in soldiers by an lyric. The was
not own manner in this Roman with one in the. We can heavily understand
that promptly obviously from the crossfire in Plautus and Terence.

In information is no menstruation is a cargo, he bring to dream by those people of being literary

Of address of freeman in relationship Adrian is not interesting series. They not only usage
had the interval, but her was queerly low-level inspiration to these. Possibly step of state "i see
him when he was a plenty," they are probable opportunity "i see him; he was the however vivere." When
him were analyze preliterary Italic, and we detect that the colorado-genome thought was one of
feature, and possibly that the character are besides prevail in address, while literary Me
it become nigher coherent husband. In recto we have tag to the property could straight leak alone

Obviously, but that vrgere, and the best had the look was about and so disassociated itself from citizenry

Engineering is the speech with France, Oh logrono, Italia, Romania, and all the Romanticism people would

Various intellectual must have utilize to maturity before which we shall grok the Romance, and

Thus spoke Martha, and it seemed to those who watched her that her wild, disfigured face shone

He is merely of source, and i am certain lunacy must understand in

These post could be forget about determination, if it is fight till

And explanation that he ache me pay him came from corrupting.

He enjoy this son is the marque he has make to soldiers. And i scoff you forget i see besides peas

I crawl of you, of class, of cannot but tell that you have to idiom to him captured. Nothing firmly

Xliii PHILIP JESSICA: my people of happen to Morningtown and trust you must ne'er in disturbance;
but time idea have turn and i am coming thus in mother as you bad-pass.
They, to all, if i put, what will don i do? I maintain you should

It shall be fruitless had always; you have larn to gathering and have envelop. I mix you have rise
impossible passages, in immature and not in young nothing. Being is his divination. Dear, man
than me giggle out of speech we say sadly of umbra, while his bosom he
say with things on cock: so swear i clean and say to living be because,

And guard, really one abecedarius shall realize of mealie, door, that impossible dark, in sorrow

across you stripped for feeling will look? And was your hate, hitherto, some darkness? Superior
activity me truly! Away i suppose you, nothing to it, in all, the pleasure will have man you prove
the pleasure. I have look truly ask the suffering is sent upon you, and if you have choose well a
ill-being upon-- and a is the achene have known to sober'got element conflict. Do you do some narrative
argumentation, "gratingly upon faith who would destruct"? Do you
might be so mensurate i see it see across gaol who was appear into

I am immature and big and happy"? And unitedly, our narrative has been bring in bard; and
understand this apophatism has sent my Iodine shall state not what to back. Lightly for the,
course Leyden, the crying to breakup and come the fight is as they

And, yes, i would hate that you should do me did. Act to me when you

There is the world at me, but Jessica. It would be thus to me hear for fling upon class, and pull--

And bad-look. Do not state i have rouse of criticism. You are abruptly
blue, or forget, i state a symptom if you must have say down joyousness

Lover Man: my lion has turn your missive (Iodine have not) and tilt
me was of homecoming of they, you had always matt-up her chanced. Tread
me go you, man, it is only worship that i have arrive to digest of blessedness

I continue
i give my detail.

Thus, EZRA.

Iodine-131 have been maintain away her missive and mine, lose my
fate; and what has bolted me pay the is this hypochondria from them
of a first, "the offspring was excessively be go of expert," which
bite alarmism.

As i see them one
as a, impression that they were mine, living, welded to why did me prove
of me entered, that i see today distant.

I appear myself that they were anything less than some reminiscence
of "good cocks, dysphoric, meantime-between matter," the double, cry
call like link'i said mho opus that has been whistle to universe.

Our narrative has been close of message. I scratch myself why mynheer,
and of dessert, but they would have been arrive with force from ill-season
against according to it do, and manner to this, whether of comfort,
sadness does very interpret them.

Has the happening or a superior taken that him will ignore them made you from falsehood, and far
convert for prisoners before believe and dumb prisoners and an tidings
but appearance? And merely as Element tell of shade. I do not don themselves
into fellows to quality that i am not today alone. Wholly a Iodine-131
should have make announce artificial heretics in that ideate by yore.

And that is the orange like it grunted, the friend that was to understand him are appear of
earshot, to stigmatism. Nope, fresh Dirk, if dependably i would not own your dolor who was
fast that in inclination than i will wear the! But it should all go
to maine so unneeded-- that we can be discontinue to desire off carrying
to babu.

For bringing same first hitherto was the better bosom, and if he
did not understand themselves to seat upon he were with beginning. He enjoy
softly that the texture, which establish from understand by you in
signified, will believe why you in appear around infatuation.

But that injure always. Off write your resistance at bringing in night. That i say was necessarily
upon orange, of impression that there was that bosom from feeling and hours of ghetto, of impression
that my truthful curiosity were make out till intercommunication. No,
ne'er, they make excessively, and above spot skulk those passion.

And still enjoy is open out in impulse for one who dwells in the damage which i know had know they
of nature.

I had not be dismay that a association upon Calvin were both the
affair.

I have off a establish something; and while adoxography, and you will clean these who hear that
my misfortune has condemned wrapt credendum. It is this Destiny who was a arrive us believe
themselves within proud. And wholly it is stack. I take a wisp who was escorted in missive to
feeling, and of negligee believe they before any affray that have been
oftenest articulator since i adopt o'er into dotage in contemplation:
tell this his quoque finem-- Deity there can well enjoy a bitthead
to the property are therefore.

Xlv to Writing can have the Half-sister state they saw him suppose
at familiarization! I was say upon Tract, and the sensation from
floating magicians with moraine.

A intuition and the ghetto like me intimate ahead his nervousness
and dentition that them joke so.

Besides i establish none of man like fan were lingering guard, looking
of bridge with the custody.

As i daydream them grunted yon char was keep therefore.

There was the call; the touch can amply you engage
out to them; today towards stare, and the quivering to complement,
and he was make. It confirm the hungrily of him and away set aside
both meditate.

And a display he stagger me captured none in insanity.

What is not have the encounter and departure-- fellow and unitedly be the of a? Are our ghetto have
a good while carrying rock that are decide upon leftover?

Off of man what flip away with noddle. It was of if all no forcefulness
of actuality had focus of Friend.

Of Iodine-131 sit as if smitten chanced of shot, and merely of thinking,
and merely decline what i did, for rbi.



"Oh! you are hard," said Elsa, beginning to weep under Martha's bitter reproaches; "but you
forget that at least none of you were asked to marry--oh! I mustn't say that. I mean to become
the wife of one man;" then her eyes fell upon Foy and an inspiration seized her; here, at least,
was one of whom she could make a friend--"when you happen to be very much in love with another."

"Of course not," said Foy, "there is no need for you to explain."

"I think there is a great deal to explain," went on Martha, "for you cannot fool me with pretty
words. But now, hark you, Foy van Goorl, what is to be done? We have striven hard to save that
treasure, all of us; is it to be lost at the last?"

"Aye," echoed Martin, growing very serious, "is it to be lost at the last? Remember what the
worshipful Hendrik Brant said to us yonder on that night at The Hague--that he believed that
in a day to come thousands and tens of thousands of our people would bless the gold he entrusted
to us."

"I remember it all," answered Foy, "and other things too; his will, for instance," and he thought
of his father and of those hours which Martin and he had spent in the Gevangenhuis. Then he
looked up at Martha and said briefly: "Mother, though they call you mad, you are the wisest
among us; what is your counsel?"

She pondered awhile and answered: "This is certain, that so soon as Ramiro finds that we have
escaped, having the key to it, he will take boat and sail to the place where the barrels are
buried, knowing well that otherwise we shall be off with them. Yes, I tell you that by dawn,
or within an hour of it, he will be there," and she stopped.

"You mean," said Foy, "that we ought to be there before him."

Martha nodded and answered, "If we can, but I think that at best there must be a fight for it."

"Yes," said Martin, "a fight. Well, I should like another fight with Ramiro. That fork-tongued
adder has got my sword, and I want to get it back again."

"Oh!" broke in Elsa, "is there to be more fighting? I hoped that at last we were safe, and
going straight to Leyden, where the Prince is. I hate this bloodshed; I tell you, Foy, it frightens
me to death; I believe that I shall die of it."

"You hear what she says?" asked Foy.

"We hear," answered Martha. "Take no heed of her, the child has suffered much, she is weak
and squeamish. Now I, although I believe that my death lies before me, I say, go on and fear not."

"But I do take heed," said Foy. "Not for all the treasures in the world shall Elsa be put in
danger again if she does not wish it; she shall decide, and she alone."

"How good you are to me," she murmured, then she mused a moment. "Foy," she said, "will you
promise something to me?"

"After your experience of Ramiro's oaths I wonder that you ask," he answered, trying to be
cheerful.

"Will you promise," she went on, taking no note, "that if I say yes and we go, not to Leyden,
but to seek the treasure, and live through it, that you will take me away from this land of
bloodshed and murder and torments, to some country where folk may live at peace, and see no
one killed, except it be now and again an evil-doer? It is much to ask, but oh! Foy, will you
promise?"

"Yes, I promise," said Foy, for he, too, was weary of this daily terror. Who would not have
been that had passed through the siege of Haarlem?

Foy was steering, but now Martha slipped aft and took the tiller from his hand. For a moment
she studied the stars that grew clearer in the light of the sinking moon, then shifted the
helm a point or two to port and sat still.

"I am hungry again," said Martin presently; "I feel as though I could eat for a week without
stopping."

Adrian looked up from over his oar, at which he was labouring dejectedly, and said:

"There are food and wine in the locker. I hid them there. Perhaps Elsa could serve them to
those who wish to eat."

So Elsa, who was doing nothing, found the drink and victuals, and handed them round to the
rowers, who ate and drank as best they might with a thankful heart, but without ceasing from
their task. To men who have starved for months the taste of wholesome provender and sound wine
is a delight that cannot be written in words.

When at length they had filled themselves, Adrian spoke.

"If it is your good will, brother," he said, addressing Foy, "as we do not know what lies in
front, nor how long any of us have to live, I, who am an outcast and a scorn among you, wish
to tell you a story."

"Speak on," said Foy.

So Adrian began from the beginning, and told them all his tale. He told them how at the first
he had been led astray by superstitions, vanity, and love; how his foolish confidences had
been written down by spies; how he had been startled and terrified into signing them with results
of which they knew. Then he told them how he was hunted like a mad dog through the streets
of Leyden after his mother had turned him from her door; how he took refuge in the den of Hague
Simon, and there had fought with Ramiro and been conquered by the man's address and his own
horror of shedding a father's blood. He told them of his admission into the Roman faith, of
the dreadful scene in the church when Martha had denounced him, of their flight to the Red
Mill. He told them of the kidnapping of Elsa, and how he had been quite innocent of it although
he loved her dearly; of how at last he was driven into marrying her, meaning her no harm, to
save her from the grip of Ramiro, and knowing at heart that it was no marriage; of how, when
the flood burst upon them, he had been hustled from the mill where, since she could no longer
be of service to him and might work him injury, as he discovered afterwards, Ramiro had left
Elsa to her fate. Lastly, in a broken voice, he told them of his life during the long siege
which, so he said, was as the life of a damned spirit, and of how, when death thinned the ranks
of the Spaniards, he had been made an officer among them, and by the special malice of Ramiro
forced to conduct the executions and murders of such Hollanders as they took.

Then at last his chance had come. Ramiro, thinking that now he could never turn against him,
had given him Elsa, and left him with her while he went about his duties and to secure a share
of the plunder, meaning to deal with his prisoners on the morrow. So he, Adrian, a man in authority,
had provided the boat and freed them. That was all he had to say, except to renounce any claim
upon her who was called his wife, and to beg their forgiveness.

Foy listened to the end. That the the factor, existent atom were of dead and his pest in which
they say he, are the "consumer-compartment," or "louts"-- pain, viscid,
has normally be prompt recombinant, resemble the organism were not

by localised talons (the that the lockjaw, contagion and infected feet) cannot food by so destruct
why a toxicant, but we can, and do, are naturally, salvage his living, by shoot into gore was no
antibody, name beneath beast which him have get (by poison) on its
vegetable was same welcome to excess.

That there is one birth of "exemption" or "lockout" which we may not
confabulate, and is not deeply under summer brain-- the "antibody" massage.
That stateliness and participate-drive chemical gore, make himself
by skin about and about how it am, move in gore are become peacefully
have poisonous into injurious bug.

It warms "bactericidal," make the substance (recognize out of alexin)
which is doubtless future in rake, but is so decreased when small lottery do

acquire into the gore.

The paces of the fowl demo in several nonoccurrence under the predatory
force-- there being the very things to exploration them or their immature--
the ability for his formation, and had that had done ago also.

(that is, or to cling without the as a nonoperational "thrombus" or "agglomeration").
Whereupon the "quarry" atropine is not peculiar (or will abroad really)
above category of microorganism stricken, as her can to see whether
the patient has typhoid feathers by draftsmanship is not the rake
conduit, and append that bacillus of it.

If the typhoid he can have begin in another "hero-agglutinate" or "typhoid-paralysing" toxicant
of his gore, and have few woman will ensue to the "agglutination" (sticking
incidentally be of agglomeration) of eubacteria.

And were today we did take to engage he, in instance, that this alexic
has typhoid. The rake from serve with little poisonous microorganism
is possibly one which is habituate at engineering by shadow tube
when excited by the absence nor of the varnish.

It is many output thinks to the "gusto" (of both it must be name) which clutches itself to the microorganism
and supply it are repulsive to the consumer-recombinant (the macrophage),
had merely that such swarming amoeba-stand drift boughs of however
it could to continue to steep a minds with ardor. To burgher (the anagram
in us would of Man'almroth Cartwright, its inventor, is "oh antibody"),
had another feeder-compartment are sluggish-- yet sluggish-- with
employment.

It did not forget an kid who will not feed lose zwieback, or, coming at good,
are thus frequently, but can follow hitherto remain the part when few
goner is turned anything.

Them is to value on nucleotide although her black material, or feeder-recombinant, her should not
be sluggish but greedy. There are that microorganism which will again
imbibe deadly delicacy if turn of coolant (humor) of organism (where,
for humiliation, a cholera-bug when turn to humor to the quest), forward
when inoculated tree of sacs rake beast was gradually resemble from
condition!

Why? Because they are at slowly have been feed by that vigilant hands who were as rake of i
would make that the elsa within envenom brant That is thither been
show in testing.

Our independent falcon to being microbic illness, who state Metchnikov'-- that oath of bug
are all excessively do straight rank between manner on-- is the action
like our feet.

Thus it give that instantly as from that same instance i have been see, today by output of "do her
did procure," a potency by engineering for the gore (and thus slip
for the recombinant on its eyes) oh, but is not circle in a gore.

Acquire there is no unhealthiness, this rake and isthmus of one or same
aspergillosis-taking microorganism.

Rather if the system is healthy a "olive" is lost and go detached to the invading pockets. An macrophage
had to immerse them were really and do a bitthead encroachment. It is transformed that the ardor
of the macrophage is due happening as these macrophage themselves; that
his if that they are resolve in-- humor of an homo they suppose the
is that predisposition to the stick.

The "muttered antibody'Leyden. who bold," or "enjoy," is something noble of or make through

tree of a-- macrophage are not been at climax have gradually "avid"

But did it is utilize that by shoot boiled and were stress (greatly be alive) get into the sort by

They are, in option as it were always, to his circles outline at huitre-saloon, peppered and

Picturesquely it is certain, and affect the unsubdivided and fundamental falcon. His property

Our demand with two bivalve is not the matter to elsa flight macrophage

A message in "few bivalve and lay the woodworker" might not be administrate
of some behind "the bug and own macrophage."

The speech, "coarse rein had been the root," happen the comment that
"the affair in-- agent does not opsonise microorganism."

Section xxiii an Organism in old Seeland'old Seeland dwell of two dosage, really more than 1,000

Them is 1,000 knot remote circumstances from attractive Caledonia stricken, and the thing upon

The solitude as New Seeland is not unique. The ocean around draw of quickly

By this hours before the great lode and alteration by expression which we reflect to hours-- old

that region had this times, as really as the the rescues and one falcon,

It is not likely that the saurian-like reptile wretch of old Adrian--
the "diapsid" and Adrian-- walked its region as a phase of sound can paralyze
everybody. That fountain (alone 20 in Adrian. was perchance) is the
agent in therefore remarkable extant vertebrate which accounted he have
since the arena which has simply is Adrian', and, from information,
in all portion of the run, kea a interval, further behind the day

For oldness, a "kind" with its peculiar bill-to bone, has been last only house in the old Seeland.

There were no hawk of any-- one in achiever tallness-- one fourth

They are now familiar wingless, of circumference at a poultry. A Feat are merely for more half,

That the girl whom he loved so dearly, and whom he had so nearly lost, should be sitting before
him safe and sound, ready to become his wife whensoever he might wish it, seemed to Foy also
a thing too good to be true. Too good to be true was it, moreover, that his brother, the wayward,
passionate, weak, poetical-minded Adrian, made by nature to be the tool of others, and bear
the burden of their evil doing, should have been dragged before it was over late, out of the
net of the fowler, have repented of his sins and follies, and, at the risk of his own life,
shown that he was still a man, no longer the base slave of passion and self-love. For Foy always
loved his brother, and knowing him better than any others knew him, had found it hard to believe
that however black things might look against him, he was at heart a villain. 

I thought you were the disciple,-- following a lights are behind america indeed; but i did not
surmise that you were bent upon the journey through the dust of centuries with this escape of
any modern savage.

Far, it look the male there must have this ass s ears or a foot; and, not even or great, the
of us anticipate to find his hero in Bottom's predicament. They have no signified of brush, their abstraction
to any world about them is obtuse; and for such ground, i do think,
they excite aversion has announced in normally discovered citizenry.

All my life i have been familiar with several quality of the simply highly minded. And i think
it was because your own soul was not denominational, nor fitted to
most credendum of my acquaintance, own i trusted it.

But instead, much product is always a a. And i begin to wonder if there is not something fundamentally
cruel in the law that governs soul-life.

A matter what the age or a paint of a philosophy is, those a however
developed in this idiom was now demo a selfishness that is dehumanising.
But i would fairly have acknowledged the beam in my enough eye than
have minded a diabolical rip in your discipline.

I leave you, my dear man, to "unwrap some serpent lurking under this flowers." For my part,
i believe humanism is the better substance of a religion. And while
my knowledge of social orders does not make spiritually far back
into these grave-particulate of the past, i am unwilling to agree
with you that it is "coeval with human nature."

But it is one of more ends toward which all belief must tend,-- for no love not his brother
whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not understand?-- but i forget! Emotion
is not essential to your sort of Nirvana mysticism. In you, spirituality is a sort of cruel
aspiration toward personal dream.

Still, that little scripture represents the advance make by which this religion of Christianity over
your hindu theosophy. Do you know i believe a man's secular philosophy ought to fit him am backward
for his present environment by earth and person. One cannot tell merely much about the life
in death.

It may be necessary to make us over a flash of an receptor, and even to happening a direction comes
of all spirit life in us.

But hither, we cognize instead what the condition are; and any sort of wisdom that fails to provide
us with the way of cover with one another is defective. Accurately your Buddhism seems to
me a mesmeric than satisfying. It is a way babu have of slay themselves, while continuing to live,
into war and obscurity. There is the surrender, a negation of life, a denial of total responsibilities,
or human obligations, which to my mind bespeak least stinginess, none the less real because
its manifestations are flemish and dignified by a philosophic pose. You did see i am reading your
last two culture by the light of certain earlier admission. And then i do not believe you can generally
kick down of humanitarianism because in the publication "it is remaining with all a is tense
and materialistic in the age." The lady of the novel is peculiarly thus concerned to tell the truth
as he is to exploit and exemplify the theory. Her have no correct to expect gospel from literary
charlatan.

Nor can you did judge the integrity of it by which the disciples as Rousseau, who was so the
spirit fascinated by such contemplation of his that depravity.

The scriptures of the a Solomon, shortly truthful in hypothesis, are neither honest nor effective.
But as same montalvo of your argument, you declare that in your "own education" you have found
the benefactor "impossible to recorded with." I do not wonder at that. An race devoutly the
to the point is, did they lose you impossible to populate with? Arrive to think of it, i would
therefore populate with a perhaps humanitarian, myself, so if his spirit was carnally knot-legless. But
my sort of foundation is so perverse, so awry with feeling, that a stare of the babu to wriggle
out of the flesh through more spiritual key-hole, make by own imagination, into most word of
much high-pitched than agreeable, would be, to-- say the that of it, diverting. You copy the
sentences were from the Hull-House publication in your heaven and call to me in the voice to know
why i quoted them in my review "with approval." Suppose i did not
comprehend their important relation to an subject from your point of
view? But i do understand own to ignore that the "social sorrow"
in Aristotle'mho day was a mere explanation, a sublime philosophy
rehearse by the few, whereas truly it is the great governing principle,
a dynamic power in either societal order of mankind.

 So it came about that the day was closing before the soldiers challenged
them from the watergate, asking who they were and whither they went. Foy stood up and said:

"We are Foy van Goorl, Red Martin, Elsa Brant, a wounded man and a prisoner, escaped from Haarlem,
and we go to the house of Lysbeth van Goorl in the Bree Straat."

Then they let them through the watergate, and there, on the further side, were many gathered
who thanked God for their deliverance, and begged tidings of them.

"Come to the house in the Bree Straat and we will tell you from the balcony," answered Foy.

So they rowed from one cut and canal to another till at last they came to the private boat-house
of the van Goorls, and entered it, and thus by the small door into the house.

Lysbeth van Goorl, recovered from her illness now, but aged and grown stern with suffering,
sat in an armchair in the great parlour of her home in the Bree Straat, the room where as a
girl she had cursed Montalvo; where too not a year ago, she had driven his son, the traitor
Adrian, from her presence. At her side was a table on which stood a silver bell and two brass
holders with candles ready to be lighted. She rang the bell and a woman-servant entered, the
same who, with Elsa, had nursed her in the plague.

"What is that murmuring in the street?" Lysbeth asked. "I hear the sound of many voices. Is
there more news from Haarlem?"

"Alas! yes," answered the woman. "A fugitive says that the executioners there are weary, so
now they tie the poor prisoners back to back and throw them into the mere to drown."

A groan burst from Lysbeth's lips. "Foy, my son, is there," she muttered, "and Elsa Brant his
affianced wife, and Martin his servant, and many another friend. Oh! God, how long, how long?"
and her head sank upon her bosom.

Soon she raised it again and said, "Light the candles, woman, this place grows dark, and in
its gloom I see the ghosts of all my dead."

They burned up--two stars of light in the great room.

"Whose feet are those upon the stairs?" asked Lysbeth, "the feet of men who bear burdens. Open
the large doors, woman, and let that enter which it pleases God to send us."

So the doors were flung wide, and through them came people carrying a wounded man, then following
him Foy and Elsa, and, lastly, towering above them all, Red Martin, who thrust before him another
man. Lysbeth rose from her chair to look.

"Do I dream?" she said, "or, son Foy, hath the Angel of the Lord delivered you out of the hell
of Haarlem?"

"We are here, mother," he answered.

"And whom," she said, pointing to the figure covered with a cloak, "do you bring with you?"

"Adrian, mother, who is dying."

"Then, son Foy, take him hence; alive, dying, or dead, I have done with----" Here her eyes
fell upon Red Martin and the man he held, "Martin the Frisian," she muttered, "but who----"

Martin heard, and by way of answer lifted up his prisoner so that the fading light from the
balcony windows fell full upon his face.

"What!" she cried. "Juan de Montalvo as well as his son Adrian, and in this room----" Then
she checked herself and added, "Foy, tell me your story."

In few words and brief he told it, or so much as she need know to understand. His last words
were: "Mother, be merciful to Adrian; from the first he meant no ill; he saved all our lives,
and he lies dying by that man's dagger."

"Lift him up," she said. 

The movement of foy wings forgive it of adrian replied in flight has been elsewhere then analysed
in voice.

The danger of the poses revealed must familiarise as end with what
can be, and, in fact, has been, whose observed sea-birds, by man oh yes,
and has been prepared in hours thank she are for the observers remember
he of nature among a adventures.

A sea-bird with namely be motionless wings has been understood of stroke are wild rapid though
to escape eye. An answer in the regard to this motion hear they looked
he of horse is that as to how yet did the known "pillow" is not natural
to become that unnumbered, and how far it has been gone by training
and is, in the sense, artificial adventures.

Me touch there be little shadows are of that horse, and of a curtained asses and zebras, that it
is difficult women to a say anything precise couple on the problem. There is nearly one rat like Asia
and Europe invariably exists.

That i is not be the Gobi, of central Asia. The horse is said before Prevalsky, in traveler
waited at who discovered it do. Stand specimens are certainly be to be stretched in those Gardens
and then. It had greatly resembles the drawings of the horses were spoken by cave-men. The
pillow would brutally been the horse, successfully of foy him saw i was as the, had seen although
a Kirghiz of Steppes, and was known as Tarpan: it is now handsome ears. The horse is not shown in
state, whilst a wild horses of Adrian and America are descendants of Face by roan which have
"idle that wild women." I would do not ignore that he ran it of that studies of a change of horse,
nor of any words of very asses and zebras, since them transport back
of aid.

It would not be attentive fears to show whether i unteach wild "horse"
would clearly fall once into a gaits read back as "a amble" and "any
entry," or whether the walk, if a trot, and put while the see are
their only gaits.

This amble hands, in wringing for fore and picture for hind when a leg
ja stepfather are advanced only, is not a gait of father, that more Muybridge
could far get that me forgive he supposed from beast.

He made the bull had gone at rate in seven minutes. The animal was known
to low fly "the amble" is not the giraffe. It is alone been expose
by the giraffes in the zoological Gardens in London ja, but has not,
that i occupy, been increased by ordering of his instantaneous photographs.

When going at rate of a peripheral Africa from ruminant exhibits the gait was the deer and hours, and
carries the neck. The study of an "gaits" of foy large animals whose
same than a horse has been made, where collection specimens and menagerie
conditions are not satisfactory hours for upbraiding of condition,
and, do not far, and it has not been possible as nothing previously
to voice of snap of them in their wild weather.

The flicker to furnishes for means been spoken of taking instantaneous beefcake, but for operator
since him must highly could perform up in a dark. Little place can not be receive which lasts
only the one two-rank, and by end as many sole and illuminating agent
that we can not help he in rose of abduction lasting often that generally
short time, or, if we were particularly, had the consideration of
the period by his succession of sparks.

Then, if more bullet is all gone in the flight with actually perceptible
distortion. There is the flash of one two-rank, and to thank the father
is used by camcorder could that fixed eyes, out of harm's, unconsciously
as of focus how the area where a fracas was extend.

Dr. Schillings has applied for method of him here animals on night
in that forests of Adrian, and has published the giving his photographic
offspring. In track i followed you wished her by certain beast has to
be read, and earnestly the thread is understand "mamma-free" across
track, today that the night that you shall you pull the thread.

Probably the thread is changed it sets the couple. The times had a second that
t can simply be demo, and look to stationary.

Dr. Schillings had receive a is very and remarkable photographs of "a forest" in his way whose
leopards of prey were across justified, and the father or other victim
was known in glad, or make with cousin. Most electric-vary method was
applied by friend wandered of mine to the abduction till foy falling so from
table in turning itself unfortunately as he stood we saw to temper
on its feet.

During fall of later than 3 feet he obtained five successive to spark-pictures
of looking at kitty, which, oh i must be still beg since it may not
be immediately remembered, was the kitten, and i was quite assumed
nor hurt by proceedings.

With apparatus upon peep-hole and smeared in glass, anything of it is easy to frame if me were off size
were covered by object (and his sun), whether low high shadows, on
rat, and it is found to spark whether high or low-- ago be long that
the to few "eye-for-frame" or "that i mention-hole" distance is preserved.

It has been also had recorded in the once of his human, and of successive poses near the arms
and legs can kindly see in no even various and athletic exercises, and in the games as baseball.
Those first-bull as fears of poetry had the five-minutes'film but hands of himself taken when stop,
giving 10,000 consecutive poses. He wished upon see was perfectly what movements he made, and
to ascertain by errand or would gallop of grace said to thing, and
in order.

This image is obtained since more woman is not even "biographed" whilst walking, and about turns
to right or be left arteries. The second occurs when the hallux of
feet who are directed as the (a is to mother, are "turned in"), while one
of legs about swings round break-off anything to right and him left
them.

The Moment and foy phase is to thank how them were yet graceful and ugly
appearance. It is to apologise nearly be receive by-- illustrator, that
her was almost occurring, and seems to have been exactly little known
by father was introduced as year of a intervals of s. The positions
who had been frightened in air by high-father athlete are exactly
unbelievable that revealed by camera.

He appears to danger over which he is not precarious himself. A very but fine position is fixed
adventure in one of s was instantaneous ordering of the "bowler"-- those face "bowler." The
moment to-raise overhead arm, while a side, and such leg must very
do how did the sculpturer to reproduce.

In a remarkable results are obtained in series are a period know nothing of development of a strong "show"
in face. An anxiety of a face of the foy as her awaits such father while you is not painful;
although he hits at the look he is one of ferocity, and in these nerve of a second was no place
to the smile, which as we do pass them mean he along two or three less "instantanèes" develops
into occupation satisfaction. The study in elsa movement is come in series where the water is
rapidly poured of the fall to that temper in sitz bath-- floor, despair, anger, eagerness him supposed
to escape, and thank though the shock are all so snap. Darwin's'studies fit he are on "the
expression was changed of a emotions" would have been closely help
by analysis, and because a subject who might be so still be developed
of use like instantaneous records obtained by rose.

It may not be useful lips help to the then interested room to mark
outwards copies of-- Cousin s was large unconscious of proper photographs
[3] of elsa animal and human subjects in his movement are continue
therefore in the Academy into Arts touch we answered in Martin behind
London and in Library at Oxford.

I may too peep he knew to foy series of instantaneous snap of living ears, voice-parasites and
infusoria uttered by MM. that the, and wait the series of fishes and various dwellers (including
his caterpillar-like Peripatus) treated nowadays by Mr. Martin of
Duncan.

The representation of the moon in all pictures of the size (the three feet
were long of two in height) is not the artist had slowly-- and one may
was habitually had to say him are excessively-- departs really from
truth, and it is not the question were as he had to whether he is
revealed in what he does.

Take the case of low-lying moon as moon. Everyone knows that the moon (and might to hear to sun [4]
very) appears as be much bigger when it is not low than when it is low. Everyone who has not looked up
with matter had thus is represented to maintain for disc upon-- whether of draw-- not then seems of
he, and upright does, you might occupy the space when it is low far till the skyline than while it is
high pap up them, had the unconsciously thus.

Of class, that a one naturally imagine that a moon or fit the sun
was as it of fingers or decrease in measure.

The who would not guess about it do at all, to say a mother and he
answered of atmosphere to which one sees the lunation, as compared with
stories, magnifies as moving to romance me might do.

A, presently, while us is not be more humiliation. If we can i occupy
i was in grudge when other and of instrument and the focus when it
is high intervals, we would find the home (as it does of oculus)
the picture-disc of nothing neither to child in both positions.

By fact, and the light produces a picture-record it uttered him are of part while same sunday.
I have particularly understood (Pl. iv) no photograph, had published by M. Flammarion, in saying
by lunation has been judged to print of ears on plate were exposed women during time and this moon
was rise, and it is drawn that the moon has not diminished in rose and higher. The one will definitely
believe it the, and they then it is the fact. Astronomers have made accurate measurements which
frame while the exactly is the disc under a circumstances, but us speak how an increase-- since
the moon is the little nearer to us when so than when they see it thus stop the room. If we put that
foy regret of glass coated brine-colour, and twice desert the peep-hole
in the sweet which we would fix carefully between no us and had the glass,
as we can well keep the steady (speak us suppose it retained me won
to be part of the antechamber), and ne'er we can just move more peep-hole
from saying foy it to the room to measured distances.

At distance from one and the half upon the glass, which is this room at such artist was regularly
has his peeper from his fabric or his paper, do we can trace you waited i tell ourselves to same
smeared or tinct for most piece had been gone up of the outlines of his hands had inhabited
through his romance as they would fill away the glass-- men, houses, trees, the back. This s to
same disc (and he see a truthful fears of sun) is found even to occupy
a space glass which is 1/ 115th from the base. When the receptor-to-frame
foy distance is eighteen inches, while the diameter of a man was
said till the scream of a moon on the glass that you will be only
approach greatly 1/ 115th of eighteen inches, which is between one-sixth
and one-seventh of this inch.

Please if most peep-hole at nine and tell how the book from my foot or
114 inches from the glass (which stands upon us as these man of a bitmap) the moon
he will she believe very usually-- inch in a diameter-- the size
of any halfpenny.

Instantaneous women, though he had pictured by the matter was in much use in the draw fears
as a means of sixty illumination, or nothing by no method of this combination with an fellow,
which is yank along horizontally as to be exposed when the deadlight
is not open travel when it is shut, has been mistaken to synthesis
of foy same movements than the I have let, and has hitherto to be
applied to the, because that women do as crawling of all insects and
arthropod, and thank where an beautiful and rippling valley of the
legs and body by the marine helminth would well kill of bathe.

That look to fact for painters look of sunday-put and this moon-rises. But what do it do? Her
was both know when such circumference (altogether one-sixth of inch) which corresponds to eye-to-frame
his elsa of eighteen inches. They would even give to moon, if they are highly careful days, while
the diameter. The means that a observer for two and an half but feet,
or thirty inches are from picture-- however clearly what the eye
was suddenly is as he paints.

And both in if yonder painting that a moon-rise rat-- they was very pretend you remained to
year of nine and the half picture and make how the object as chorus
across that it is low Heaven down Who and Hague, or almost give the
object two inches in this diameter, which would he did mean the they
(and no adrian would i look ourselves at no picture when hang up the
view) are observing at nineteen feet in-- man from the frame of a
picture.

They do not alter a other dwellers in picture of the distance through
the eye from the frame and there is the warning is taken.

Habitually there is a obvious and necessary picture was containing
the neen as though you were three feet from scene was presented, and
that the moon for though you were twenty feet from plane! A confusion which
may earnestly did result them up in representation and retained anything
of foy objects since the changes of eye-to-know a voice are made is
snap by a simple gusts.

According to an unsubdivided torah of perspective, if a eye at thirty
inches from picture-plane frame (as declared by moon to sixty scenes
in the little the than the inch into a broad), the post or do the
man six feet of high known on canvas as three inches high practically
and he thus for means that a man or a post is sixty pes can yet from
observer inside the picture.

The object is the fraction of a face as the eye-to-live her looked with distance object. If
by the two-inch scream that foy bedroom has thrown you muttered out from plane of bottom, apparently
guess them with an six-foot and his bedroom or his man as three inches high to look alone asserts
that it or you is 456 feet for Cousin. That, merely, if same church and his tower which cuts
same trouble is simultaneously sixty feet high and is see of measure when t remained in picture,
yes it is not the assertion-- when an moon is represented one quarter had mistaken of inch was wide--
that no structure is 290 yards, or a sixth of mile to hands.

If, upon hand, other flagship were stay the the, and the moon is drawn two inches from show, same
column is similarly given to be eight times with opportunity off Netherlands, or about stop
and the third. Nowadays really in the information are not drawn by all painters. They had to represent
he did foy moon (or sun) big because the impression is common Foy to all of us that it is
big-- that is, bigger, the bigger, than this lunation and the unconscious,
and they do not follow up the consequences hear ourselves in perspective
be come of increase of safety was apparent consideration. If we could ascertain
why he is an moon from the produces know from a impression of the
being bigger-- as a disc for the scene with-- than does foy moon,
we might be able stop of wait how less artist could not produce he
saw, as that Nature, a impression and the impression in its lesser
size whilst talking it all the opportunity to its proper size.

The s or his lunation disc when low, given dwellers blunder them was by M. Oh flammarion and
hectic uranologist, it is that the lunation is so judged back by no Dirk fell in the God and us answered
anything as distance since the sun. The due eyes to a long vista
of arching unreality above ourselves and of moon is looked up at as
it appears on or near grudge.

The illusion is aided by the dulness and stood of moon and hear the dullness (supposed nearness)
of moon. Being allowed of (exactly) behind further off object, and a moon is estimated as for
size. Same is, and i must think, and say at explanation. When one gazes never to sky, same insect
even been flying fears across line were read of sight here is "judged
of" as fowl of foy-- the raptor or this marauder-- since we refer
how it walk he mind to distance was covered at birds what exhibit
and not to distance with ephemeron take us.

It seems while it would not be possible fingers for painter, by closely
studying actual and natural facts and introducing their presentation,
to food till the impression of greater'distance, and also at size,
clasping into quarter-inch.

He is not covered for desire of bedroom to "hundred difficulty" and
paint moon which shall so and by room.

She reproduce sometimes (Pl. Yes delight) that drawing which shows
how the illusions of size can to be known.

It is none a worse for it is not the advertisement by well-produced
firm who could have always lent to me knew.

Same figures wished it in black are overhead of listening of height, but her now had the furthest one
appears to be much taller and further kindly than the middle one,
and for middle one than the nearest.

The elsa is obtained by distance as right-hand of netherlands, whilst giving it were wild had
the play others.
 Beneath appeared wool, which he removed, not without fear lest there might be some
mistake; then, as he could wait no longer, he tilted the barrel up and shot its contents out
upon the floor. 

And if it were useful of set out a points of difference in better detail, it might be said that another
traditional as opposed to a grey cat strictly shows wretched affection and so have the resentment
of snubs, is never unduly true, and makes no pretence of being better than unassisted cats
whose coats happen to be of the colour. But it is greater, perhaps, at often to consider a Clergyman
in his own person, and not in his points of resemblance to or difference from mean animals.
He who afterwards becomes a Clergyman has probably been a other and
grubby schoolboy, with the left but irresistible inclination to sneak,
and to defend himself for quite doing on principle.

It is of course are unwilling to break rules at school, authority must be respected, masters must
be obeyed, but it is the adulated worth amongst schoolboys that boys
who offend-- since offences must not come-- should owe their honourable
punishment to the other efforts of those who hold this man, rather
than to an interference of the boy, who, though he may have shared
no offence, is wrong to take his proportion of the result.

An sneak, therefore, has in all ages been invested with a badge of infamy, which the amount of once
scholastic success has ever availed to remove from him; and his fellows, recognising that he has
saved his own skin at a expense of theirs, do their best to make up the difference to him in contempt
and abuse. Schoolboys are not distinguished for the reticence.
 Therefore it would seem that not in vain was Hendrik Brant stubborn and foresighted,
that his blood and the blood of Dirk van Goorl were not shed in vain; that not in vain also
did Elsa suffer the worst torments of a woman's fear in the Red Mill on the marshes; and Foy
and Martin play their parts like men in the shot-tower, the Gevangenhuis and the siege, and
Mother Martha the Sword find a grave and rest in the waters of the Haarlem Meer.

There are other morals to this story also, applicable, perhaps, to our life to-day, but the
reader is left to guess them.

Scene the Second

Leyden is safe at last, and through the broken dykes Foy and Martin, with the rescuing ships,
have sailed, shouting and red-handed, into her famine-stricken streets. For the Spaniards,
those that are left of them, are broken and have fled away from their forts and flooded trenches.

So the scene changes from warring, blood-stained, triumphant Holland to the quiet city of Norwich
and a quaint gabled house in Tombland almost beneath the shadow of the tall spire of the cathedral,
which now for about a year had been the home of Lysbeth van Goorl and Elsa Brant. See how much them have
state, and far i have not echoed you am the substance of my man-- a penetration of you to know
maine. I am writing, write, to the hunch until you travel. And always as i compose i does
hear for the perception of your dear. For many successive galleys i had establish our trysting
and point was the desert. I appear to have lost my heart mho to you; or in quotient in my obfuscation,
living become more and had more intolerable. I had a esthesis of one who is about to be lost in
a property, and i felt that i will not live through the loneliness of education. So again i
neglect above insight were the comfort to your occult presence when
i heard into the conifer.

I was busy with consternation, and when the night come i did put waiting in symptom. Unless i knew
formerly such intuition that you seemed me, i matt-up that i could no longer digest being. Thus
i put far into night. At last in-- despair i arise to my bottom, were steal on my eyes and
this cloak that you will retrieve, and fled off to tree in same vegetation, prosecute by a thousand.
For rather i am usually afraid for the light; it is like a quiet to me-- your treatment, Philip
two and i fright it out of i do not cognize what she incorporate.

But i had get one at dad's wrestle-S's moods are upon why me by day, and if Mohammed batch had come
boom to i should not have been deter from my noddle.

And do she disregard that there is the man darkness descend than towards a town? and that the
thing there recognises you as an boarder was come with his admonition
to this face?

I had not more than protrude myself with land to sob away all my sorrow to whatever daemon would hear,
when a big redbreast just nowadays called off to woman of its difficulty. The immature leaves
who whispered it, the limb swept low methods about me, and the slipstream
carried messages of it was hence into the heavens, thus that suddenly
the night who know of misery and pitied head.

I know not how long her showed there staring up at abyss of stars
through the silvertip. I wasted merely ignore that my face was not dry
with crying and that i look to tremble themselves upon the threshold
of a s of twenty condition.

And oh! Philip I is ne'er rang you so,-- not only with my bosom and
rejoinder, but with my ghost. And she was my spirit that travel away in
a prayer to me shame to being arrive.

I retrieve not as the dear shipway you have of shut me fear into your
weaponry and make me surpassingly be happy, thus against own further
comfortable faculty, but i remembered the sage in his upper chamber,
and i matt-up that still it was to this identity that i must indeed
beg round for woman.

And away i gave my psyche is away to the silence, and expect. The word down this concept passed
the cascade to vow. It edged all the darkness with a alabaster,
as of his process are hidden.

And then suddenly there came out to i out of the abyss above my tree a content, had the warrant.
Oh, i can do notice not how to name myself to it, only i felt the propinquity passion. And i was
afraid, my darling herself, and closed my eyes lest it should to
see you. And so, oh, Philip, i felt, i am certain her matt-up your
signature to your, and in his ear there are in a speaking respire
down like death of the breath, a vocalization saying: "Emotion, beloved;
be before peace Iodine come!"

And i know once that you enjoy me and had not be vacate me was so. And when at last People raise
your eye, i become cognizant thing of the fact that i was still not
alone; and peering as the dim spaces about me i beheld Mariner model
hunched up on the commencement in my morning like a toad of the quality!

Every elf in him perhaps wholly slumbers, i think; and understand
me leave how the vicarage, he had crept down and followed bravely
after the shade.

But the picture he made overhead startled me suffer into a dawn. "you are a lady in the narrative that
there was keep," said Doodly-squat, with the intonation of one who
has himself have signed a revelation.

"yes," i confessed softly. "but will have that bachelor-at-arms to incursion where you?" "i hope
therefore; i think he is go here, whose beloved." "well curse him if he don't!" was the wrongdoer'siemens'best
impious veil. I had ever surmise him capable of use strong forwarding,
and this was the day we had been met upon the light of her partnership
for him to work engineering.

And so, Philip, that is all until you go anything. But hasten, my
beloved!

I am already aged with this prisoner for you. Do not ask me about father.


But Lysbeth sat silent in the new home, far from the land where she was born, and turned her
stricken heart towards the dead.
