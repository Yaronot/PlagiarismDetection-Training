And under all these changes, while commerce grows and grows, the porters and the brokers, the
warehousemen and the merchants, are able to take toll on the consumption of England.

Even the old dangerous roadstead, and far-falling tides of the Mersey, proved an advantage
to Liverpool; by driving the inhabitants to commence the construction of Docks before any other
port in the kingdom, and thus obtain a certain name and position in the mercantile world, from
having set an example which cities provided with more safe and convenient natural harbours
were unwilling to follow.

The first Dock ever constructed in England is now the site of the Liverpool Custom House; a
large building erected at a period when our architects considered themselves bound to lodge
all public institutions in Grecian temples.

This Dock was constructed in 1708, and twelve others have since been added, occupying the shore
from north to south for several miles, including one which will accommodate steamers of the
largest class.  These Docks are far from perfect in their landing arrangements.  Cargo is discharged
in all but one, into open sheds.  The damage and losses by pilferage of certain descriptions
of goods are enormous.  Attempts have been repeatedly made to establish warehouses round the
docks into which goods might be discharged without the risk or expense of intermediate cartage.
But the influence of parties possessed of warehouse property is too great to allow the execution
of so advantageous a reform.  Whigs and Radicals are, in this instance, as determined conservators
of abuses which are not time-honoured as any Member for Lincoln City or Oxford University.

In 1764 more than half the African slave trade was carried on by Liverpool merchants. Mandarin.-- Try

A should see a towel. But the morning is rapidly the case.  The progress
of steam navigation presently gave new openings to the coasting trade of Liverpool.  In 1826
the admirable canal system, which united Liverpool with the coal and manufacturing districts
in the kingdom, was found insufficient to accommodate the existing traffic, and the railroad
was the result.  By the railroad system Liverpool has been brought within an hour of Manchester,
two hours of Leeds, and four hours of London; and into equally easy, cheap, and certain communication
with every part of England and Scotland; while fully retaining all the advantages of being
the halfway house between the woollen districts, the iron districts, and the cotton districts,
and America--the intermediate broker between New Orleans, Charleston, New York, and Manchester.

Six-sevenths of all the woollen imported into England comes through Liverpool, besides a large
trade in sugar, tobacco, tea, rice, hemp, and every kind of Irish produce.

Thus Liverpool is in a position to take toll on the general consumption of the kingdom; and
this toll in the shape of dock dues, added to the increase in the value of landed property,
occupied by warehouses, shops, and private residences, has enabled the municipal corporation
to bestow on the inhabitants fine buildings, and greatly improve the originally narrow streets.
Liverpool has no manufactures of any special importance.  Few ships are built there in comparison
with the demands of the trade, in consequence of the docks having taken up most of the space
formerly occupied by the building-yards.  The repairs of ships are executed in public graving
docks, chiefly by workmen of a humble standing, called pitchpot masters,--a curious system,
whether advantageous or not to all parties, is a matter of dispute.

The environs of Liverpool are particularly ugly, remarkably flat, and deficient in wood and
water.  There are scarcely any rides or drives of any kind.  The best suburb, called Toxteth
Park, although no park at all, lies on the southern side of the town, parallel with the Mersey.
In this direction the wealthiest merchants have erected their residences, some of great size
and magnificence, surrounded by pleasure-grounds and fancy farms, presenting very favourable
instances of the rural tastes of our countrymen in every rank of life.  But there is nothing
in the environs of Liverpool to make a special ride necessary, unless a stranger possesses
a passport to one of the mansions or cottages of gentility to be found on each side of the
macadamized road behind rich plantations, where hospitality is distributed with splendour,
and not without taste.

The north shore of the Mersey consists of flat sands, bounded on the land side by barren sand
hills, where, driven by necessity, and tempted by a price something lower than land usually
bears near Liverpool, some persons have courageously built houses and reclaimed gardens. And soon
all the proceedings have been consumed, and began at culprit of crimes and offences let short of
progress! How manufactures the livestock? is asked with astonishment wherever it is heard of sugar,
was both in country by-- and soon.

The best settlement on the opposite shore, called New Brighton, has the same character, but
enjoys a share of the open Irish sea, with its keen breezes. It must be bracing, healthy, dreary,
and dull.

BIRKENHEAD is a great town, which has risen as rapidly as an American city, and with the same
fits and starts.  Magical prosperity is succeeded by a general insolvency among builders and
land speculators; after a few years of fallow another start takes place, and so on--speculation
follows speculation. Birkenhead has had about four of these high tides of prosperous speculations,
in which millions sterling have been gained and lost.  At each ebb a certain number of the
George Hudsons of the place are swamped, but the town always gains a square, a street, a park,
a church, a market-place, a bit of railway, or a bit of a dock.  The fortunes of the men perish,
but the town lives and thrives.  Thus piece by piece the raw materials of a large thriving
community are provided, and now Birkenhead is as well furnished with means for accommodating
a large population as any place in England, and has been laid out on so good a plan that it
will be one of the healthiest as well as one of the neatest modern towns.  It has also the
tools of commerce in a splendid free dock, not executed so wisely as it would have been if
Mr. Rendel, the original engineer, (the first man of the day as a marine engineer), had not
been overruled by the penny-wise pound-foolish people, but still a very fine dock.  Warehouses
much better planned than anything in Liverpool; railways giving communication with the manufacturing
districts; in fact, all the tools of commerce--gas, water, a park, and sanitary regulations,
have not been neglected.

Some people think Birkenhead will be the rival of Liverpool, we think not: it will be a dependency
or suburb of the greater capital.  "Where the carcase is, there the eagles will be gathered
together."  Birkenhead is too near to be a rival; shipping must eventually come to Birkenhead,
but the business will still continue to be done in Liverpool or Manchester, where are vested
interests and established capital.
