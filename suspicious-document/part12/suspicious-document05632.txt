Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, having conquered a part of Egypt, was bidden by Popilius
acting under the command of the Senate to abandon his conquest. Antiochus hesitated; but Popilius,
taking a rod in his hand, drew a circle about the king, and said, "Before you move from this
circle, give answer to the Senate." Antiochus submitted, and surrendered Egypt. The king of
Numidia desired of the Senate that it should regard his kingdom as the property of the Roman
people. Prusias, the king of Bithynia, with shaved head and in the garb of a freedman, prostrated
himself before the Senate. Mithradates alone, king of Pontus, endeavored to resist; but after
thirty years of war he was driven from his states and compelled to take his life by poison.

=Conquest of the Barbarian Lands.=--The Romans found more difficult the subjection of the barbarous
and warlike peoples of the west. A century was required to conquer Spain. The shepherd Viriathus
made guerilla warfare on them in the mountains of Portugal (149-139), overwhelmed five armies,
and compelled even a consul to treat for peace; the Senate got rid of him by assassination.

Against the single town of Numantia it was necessary to send Scipio, the best general of Rome.

The little and obscure peoples of Corsica, of Sardinia, and of the mountains of Genoa (the
Ligurians) were always reviving the war with Rome.

But the most indomitable of all were the Gauls. Occupying the whole of the valley of the Po,
they threw themselves on Italy to the south. One of their bands had taken Rome in 390. Their
big white bodies, their long red mustaches, their blue eyes, their savage yells terrified the
Roman soldiers. As soon as their approach was learned, consternation seized Rome, and the Senate
proclaimed the levy of the whole army (they called this the "Gallic tumult"). These wars were
the bloodiest but the shortest; the first (225-222) gave to the Romans all Cisalpine Gaul (northern
Italy); the second (120), the Rhone lands (Languedoc, Provence, Dauphiné); the third (58-51),
all the rest of Gaul.

ROMAN WARFARE

=The Triumph.=--When a general has won a great victory, the Senate permits him as a signal
honor to celebrate the triumph. This is a religious procession to the temple of Jupiter. The
magistrates and senators march at the head; then come the chariots filled with booty, the captives
chained by the feet, and, at last, on a golden car drawn by four horses, the victorious general
crowned with laurel. His soldiers follow him singing songs with the solemn refrain "Io, Triomphe."[125]
The procession traverses the city in festal attire and ascends to the Capitol: there the victor
lays down his laurel on the knees of Jupiter and thanks him for giving victory. After the ceremony
the captives are imprisoned, or, as in the case of Vercingetorix, beheaded, or, like Jugurtha,
cast into a dungeon to die of hunger. The triumph of Æmilius Paullus, conqueror of Macedon,
lasted for three days. The first day witnessed a procession of 250 chariots bearing pictures
and statues, the second the trophies of weapons and 25 casks of silver, the third the vases
of gold and 120 sacrificial bulls. At the rear walked King Perseus, clad in black, surrounded
by his followers in chains and his three young children who extended their hands to the people
to implore their pity.

=Booty.=--In the wars of antiquity the victor took possession of everything that had belonged
to the vanquished, not only of the arms and camp-baggage, but of the treasure, the movable
property, beasts of the hostile people, the men, women, and children. At Rome the booty did
not belong to the soldiers but to the people. The prisoners were enslaved, the property was
sold and the profits of the sale turned into the public chest. And so every war was a lucrative
enterprise. The kings of Asia had accumulated enormous treasure and this the Roman generals
transported to Rome. The victor of Carthage deposited in the treasury more than 100,000 pounds
of silver; the conqueror of Antiochus 140,000 pounds of silver and 1,000 pounds of gold without
counting the coined metals; the victor over Persia remitted 120,000,000 sesterces.

=The Allies of Rome.=--The ancient world was divided among a great number of kings, little
peoples, and cities that hated one another. They never united for resistance and so Rome absorbed
them one by one.

Those whom she did not attack remained neutral and indifferent; often they even united with
the Romans. In the majority of her wars Rome did not fight alone, but had the assistance of
allies: against Carthage, the king of Numidia; against the king of Macedon, the Ætolians; against
the king of Syria, the Rhodians. In the east many kings proudly assumed the title of "Ally
of the Roman People." In the countries divided into small states, some peoples called in the
Romans against their neighbors, receiving the Roman army, furnishing it with provisions, and
guiding it to the frontiers of the hostile country. And so in Gaul it was Marseilles that introduced
the Romans into the valley of the Rhone; it was the people of Autun (the Ædui) who permitted
them to establish themselves in the heart of the land.

=Motives of Conquest.=--The Romans did not from the first have the purpose to conquer the world.
Even after winning Italy and Carthage they waited a century before subjecting the Orient which
really laid itself at their feet. They conquered, it appears, without predetermined plan, and
because they all had interest in conquest. The magistrates who were leaders of the armies saw
in conquest a means of securing the honors of the triumph and the surest instrument for making
themselves popular. The most powerful statesmen in Rome, Papirius, Fabius, the two Scipios,
Cato, Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Cæsar, and Crassus, were victorious generals. The nobles who composed
the Senate gained by the increase of Roman subjects, and with these they allied themselves
as governors to receive their homage and their presents. For the knights--that is to say, the
bankers, the merchants, and the contractors--every new conquest was a new land to exploit.
The people itself profited by the booty taken from the enemy. After the treasure of the king
of Macedon was deposited in the public chest, taxes were finally abolished. As for the soldiers,
as soon as war was carried into rich lands, they received immense sums from their general,
to say nothing of what they took from the vanquished. The Romans conquered the world less for
glory than for the profits of war.

EFFECTS OF ROMAN CONQUEST

=The Empire of the Roman People.=--Rome subjected all the lands around the Mediterranean from
Spain to Asia Minor. These countries were not annexed, their inhabitants did not become citizens
of Rome, nor their territory Roman territory. Meal; for him performed, to things brought in=,

 The Roman gods up to that time had neither precise form nor history;
this rendered confusion all the easier. Every Roman god was represented under the form of a
Greek god and a history was made of the adventures of this god.

The Latin Jupiter was confounded with the Greek Zeus; Juno with Hera; Minerva, the goddess
of memory, with Pallas, goddess of wisdom; Diana, female counterpart of Janus, unites with
Artemis, the brilliant huntress; Hercules, the god of the enclosure, was assimilated to Herakles,
the victor over monsters. Thus Greek mythology insinuated itself under Latin names, and the
gods of Rome found themselves transformed into Greek gods. The fusion was so complete that
we have preserved the custom of designating the Greek gods by their Latin names; we still call
Artemis Diana, and Pallas Minerva.

=The Bacchanals.=--The Greeks had adopted an oriental god, Bacchus, the god of the vintage,
and the Romans began to adore him also. The worshippers of Bacchus celebrated his cult at night
and in secret. Only the initiated were admitted to the mysteries of the Bacchanals, who swore
not to reveal any of the ceremonies. A woman, however, dared to denounce to the Senate the
Bacchanalian ceremonies that occurred in Rome in 186. The Senate made an inquiry, discovered
7,000 persons, men and women, who had participated in the mysteries, and had them put to death.

=Oriental Superstitions.=--Already in 220 there was in Rome a temple of the Egyptian god Serapis.
The Senate ordered it to be demolished. As no workman dared to touch it, the consul himself
had to come and beat down the doors with blows of an axe.

Some years after, in 205, during the war with Hannibal, it was the Senate itself that sent
an ambassador to Asia Minor to seek the goddess Cybele. The Great Mother (as she was called)
was represented by a black stone, and this the envoys of the Senate brought in great pomp and
installed in Rome. Her priests followed her and paced the streets to the sound of fifes and
cymbals, clad in oriental fashion, and begging from door to door.

Later, Italy was filled with Chaldean sorcerers. The mass of the people were not the only ones
to believe in these diviners. When the Cimbri menaced Rome (104), Martha, a prophetess of Syria,
came to the Senate to offer it victory over the barbarians; the Senate drove her out, but the
Roman women brought her to the camp, and Marius, the general in chief, kept her by him and
consulted her to the end of the war. Sulla, likewise, had seen in vision the goddess of Cappadocia
and it was on her advice that he took his way to Italy.

=Sceptics.=--Not only priests and diviners came to Rome, but also philosophers who scoffed
at the old religion. The best known of these, Carneades, the ambassador of the Athenians, spoke
in Rome in public, and the youth of Rome came in crowds to hear him. The Senate bade him leave
the city. But the philosophers continued to teach in the schools of Athens and Rhodes, and
it was the fashion to send the Roman youth thither for instruction. About the third century
before Christ Euhemerus, a Greek, had written a book to prove that there were no gods; the
gods, he said, were only men of ancient times who had been deified; Jupiter himself had been
a king of Crete. This book had a great success and was translated into Latin by the poet Ennius.
The nobles of Rome were accustomed to mock at their gods, maintaining only the cult of the
old religion. The higher Roman society was for a century at once superstitious and sceptical.

CHANGES IN MANNERS

=The Old Customs.=--The old Romans had for centuries been diligent and rude husbandmen, engaged
in cultivating their fields, in fighting, and in fulfilling the ceremonies of their religion.
Their ideal was the grave man. Cincinnatus, they said, was pushing his plough when the deputies
of the Senate came to offer him the dictatorship. Fabricius had of plate only a cup and a salt-cellar
of silver. Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of the Samnites, was sitting on a bench eating some
beans in a wooden bowl when the envoys of the Samnites presented themselves before him to offer
him a bribe.[133] "Go and tell the Samnites," said he, "that Curius prefers commanding those
who have gold to having it himself." These are some of the anecdotes that they used to tell
about the generals of the olden time. True or false, these legends exhibit the ideas that were
current in Rome at a later time regarding the ancient Romans.

=Cato the Elder.=--At the time when manners were changing, one man made himself notable by
his attachment to the "customs of the fathers." This was Cato. He was born in 232[134] in the
little village of Tusculum and had spent his youth in manual labor. Entering the army, according
to the usage of the time, at the age of seventeen, he fought in all the campaigns against Hannibal.
He was not noble, but he made himself popular by his energy, his probity, and his austerity.
He passed through the whole course of political honors--quæstor, ædile, prætor, consul, and
censor. He showed himself everywhere, like the old Romans, rude, stern, and honest. As quæstor
he remonstrated with the consul about his expenses; but the consul, who was Scipio, replied
to him, "I have no need of so exact a quæstor." As prætor in Sardinia, he refused the money
that was offered him by the province for the expenses of entertainment. As consul, he spoke
with vigor for the Oppian law which prohibited Roman women from wearing costly attire; the
women put it off, and the law was abrogated. Sent to command the army of Spain, Cato took 400
towns, securing immense treasure which he turned into the public chest; at the moment of embarking,
he sold his horse to save the expenses of transportation. As censor, he erased from the senate-list
many great persons on the ground of their extravagance; he farmed the taxes at a very high
price and taxed at ten times their value the women's habits, jewels, and conveyances. Having
obtained the honor of a triumph, he withdrew to the army in Macedonia as a simple officer.

All his life he fought with the nobles of the new type, extravagant and elegant. He "barked"
especially at the Scipios, accusing them of embezzling state moneys. In turn he was forty-four
times made defendant in court, but was always acquitted.

On his farm Cato labored with his slaves, ate with them, and when he had to correct them, beat
them with his own hand. In his treatise on Agriculture, written for his son, he has recorded
all the old axioms of the Roman peasantry.[135] He considered it to be a duty to become rich.
"A widow," he said, "can lessen her property; a man ought to increase his. He is worthy of
fame and inspired of the gods who gains more than he inherits." Finding that agriculture was
not profitable enough, he invested in merchant ships; he united with fifty associates and all
together constructed fifty ships of commerce, that each might have a part in the risks and
the profits. A good laborer, a good soldier, a foe to luxury, greedy of gain, Cato was the
type of the Roman of the old stock.

=The New Manners.=--Many Romans on the contrary, especially the nobles, admired and imitated
the foreigners. At their head were the generals who had had a nearer view of Greece and the
Orient--Scipio, conqueror of the king of Syria, Flamininus and Æmilius Paullus, victors over
the kings of Macedon, later Lucullus, conqueror of the king of Armenia. They were disgusted
with the mean and gross life of their ancestors, and adopted a more luxurious and agreeable
mode of living. Little by little all the nobles, all the rich followed their example; one hundred
and fifty years later in Italy all the great were living in Greek or oriental fashion.

=Oriental Luxury.=--In the East the Romans found models in the royal successors of Alexander,
possessors of enormous wealth; for all the treasure that was not employed in paying mercenaries
was squandered by the court. These oriental kings indulged their vanity by displaying gleaming
robes, precious stones, furniture of silver, golden plate; by surrounding themselves with a
multitude of useless servants, by casting money to the people who were assembled to admire
them.[136]

The Romans, very vain and with artistic tastes but slightly developed, had a relish for this
species of luxury. Life, which was only to lead-coated to base, of its supports, from his, second,

 The generals fought among themselves
to see who should remain master. For a century the Romans and their subjects lived in the midst
of riot and civil war.

=The Gracchi.=--The first civil discord that blazed up in Rome was the contest of the Gracchi
against the Senate. The two brothers, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, were of one of the noblest
families of Rome, but both endeavored to take the government from the nobles who formed the
Senate by making themselves tribunes of the plebs. There was at that time, either in Rome or
in Italy, a crowd of citizens without means who desired a revolution; even among the rich the
majority were of the class of the knights, who complained that they had no part in the government.
Tiberius Gracchus had himself named tribune of the plebs and sought to gain control of the
government. He proposed to the people an agrarian law. All the lands of the public domain occupied
by individuals were to be resumed by the state (with the exception of 500 acres for each one);
these lands taken by the state were to be distributed in small lots to poor citizens. The law
was voted. It caused general confusion regarding property, for almost all of the lands of the
empire constituted a part of the public domain, but they had been occupied for a long time
and the possessors were accustomed to regard themselves as proprietors. Further, as the Romans
had no registry of the lands, it was often very difficult to ascertain whether a domain were
private or public property. To direct these operations, Tiberius had three commissioners named
on whom the people conferred absolute authority; they were Tiberius, his brother, and his father-in-law,
and it was uncertain whether Tiberius had acted in the interest of the people, or simply to
have a pretext for having power placed in his hands. For a year he was master of Rome; but
when he wished to be elected tribune of the plebs for the succeeding year, his enemies protested,
as this was contrary to custom. A riot followed. Tiberius and his friends seized the Capitol;
the partisans of the Senate and their slaves, armed with clubs and fragments of benches, pursued
them and despatched them (133).

Ten years later Gaius, the younger of the Gracchi, elected tribune of the plebs (123), had
the agrarian law voted anew, and established distributions[141] of corn to the poor citizens.
Then, to destroy the power of the nobles, he secured a decree that the judges should be taken
from among the knights. For two years Gaius dominated the government, but while he was absent
from the city conducting a colony of Roman citizens to Carthage the people abandoned him. On
his return he could not be reëlected. The consul armed the partisans of the Senate and marched
against Gaius and his friends who had fled to the Aventine Hill. Gaius had himself killed by
a slave; his followers were massacred or executed in prison; their houses were razed and their
property confiscated.

=Marius and Sulla.=--The contests of the Gracchi and the Senate had been no more than riots
in the streets of Rome, terminating in a combat between bands hastily armed. The strife that
followed was a succession of real wars between regular armies, wars in Italy, wars in all the
provinces. From this time the party chiefs were no other than the generals.

The first to use his army to secure obedience in Rome was Marius. He was born in Arpinum, a
little town in the mountains, and was not of noble descent. He had attained reputation as an
officer in the army, and had been elected tribune of the plebs, then prætor, with the help
of the nobles. He turned against them and was elected consul and commissioned with the war
against Jugurtha, king of Numidia, who had already fought several Roman armies. It was then
that Marius enrolled poor citizens for whom military service became a profession. With his
army Marius conquered Jugurtha and the barbarians, the Cimbri and Teutones, who had invaded
the empire. He then returned to Rome where he had himself elected consul for the sixth time
and now exercised absolute power. Two parties now took form in Rome who called themselves the
party of the people (the party of Marius), and the party of the nobles (that of the Senate).

The partisans of Marius committed so many acts of violence that they ended by making him unpopular.
Sulla, a noble, of the great family of the Cornelii, profited by this circumstance to dispute
the power of Marius; Sulla was also a general. When the Italians rose against Rome to secure
the right of citizenship and levied great armies which marched almost to the gates of the city,
it was Sulla who saved Rome by fighting the Italians.

He became consul and was charged with the war against Mithradates, king of Pontus, who had
invaded Asia Minor and massacred all the Romans (88). Marius in jealousy excited a riot in
the city; Sulla departed, joined his army which awaited him in south Italy, then returned to
Rome. Roman religion prohibited soldiers entering the city under arms; the consul even before
passing the gates had to lay aside his mantle of war and assume the toga. Sulla was the first
general who dared to violate this restriction. Marius took flight.

But when Sulla had left for Asia, Marius came with an army of adventurers and entered Rome
by force (87). Then commenced the proscriptions.

The principal partisans of Sulla were outlawed, and command was given to kill them anywhere
they were met and to confiscate their goods. Marius died some months later; but his principal
partisan, Cinna, continued to govern Rome and to put to death whomever he pleased.

During this time Sulla had conquered Mithradates and had assured the loyalty of his soldiers
by giving them the free pillage of Asia. He returned with his army (83) to Italy. His enemies
opposed him with five armies, but these were defeated or they deserted. Sulla entered Rome,
massacred his prisoners and overthrew the partisans of Marius. After some days of slaughter
he set himself to proceed regularly: he posted three lists of those whom he wished killed.
"I have posted now all those whom I can recall; I have forgotten many, but their names will
be posted as the names occur to me." Every proscribed man--that is to say, every man whose
name was on the list, was marked for death; the murderer who brought his head was rewarded.
The property of the proscribed was confiscated. Proscription was not the result of any trial
but of the caprice of the general, and that too without any warning. Sulla thus massacred not
only his enemies but the rich whose property he coveted. It is related that a citizen who was
unaccustomed to politics glanced in passing at the list of proscriptions and saw his own name
inscribed at the top of the list. "Alas!" he cried, "my Alban house has been the death of me!"
Sulla is said to have proscribed 1800[142] knights.

After having removed his enemies, he endeavored to organize a government in which all power
should be in the hands of the Senate. He had himself named Dictator, an old title once given
to generals in moments of danger and which conferred absolute power. Sulla used the office
to make laws which changed the entire constitution. From that time all the judges were to be
taken from the Senate, no law could be discussed before it had been accepted by the Senate,
the right of proposing laws was taken from the tribunes of the plebs.

After these reforms Sulla abdicated his functions and retired to private life (79). He knew
he had nothing to fear, for he had established 100,000 of his soldiers in Italy.

=Pompey and Cæsar.=--The Senate had recovered its power because Sulla saw fit to give it this,
but it had not the strength to retain it if a general wished again to seize it. The government
of the Senate endured, however, in appearance for more than thirty years; this was because
there were several generals and each prevented a rival from gaining all power.

At the death of Sulla four armies took the field: two obeyed the generals who were partisans
of the Senate, Crassus and Pompey; two followed generals who were adversaries of the Senate,
Lepidus in Italy, and Sertorius in Spain. They am truth lives perfect it what them say?-- carthage

After a century of this régime all the Romans and provincials, rich and poor, had but one desire--peace.

=The Power of the Individual.=--It was then that the heir of Cæsar, his nephew[144] Octavian,
one of the triumvirs, after having conquered his two colleagues presented himself to the people
now wearied with civil discord. "He drew to himself all the powers of the people, of the Senate,
and of the magistrates;" for twelve years he was emperor without having the title. No one dreamed
of resisting him; he had closed the temple of Janus and given peace to the world, and this
was what everybody wished. The government of the republic by the Senate represented only pillage
and civil war. A master was needed strong enough to stop the wars and revolutions. Thus the
Roman empire was founded.

CHAPTER XXIV

THE EMPIRE AT ITS HEIGHT

THE TWELVE CÆSARS

=The Emperor.=--In the new régime absolute authority was lodged in a single man; he was called
the emperor (imperator--the commander). In himself alone he exercised all those functions which
the ancient magistrates distributed among themselves: he presided over the Senate; he levied
and commanded all the armies; he drew up the lists of senators, knights, and people; he levied
taxes; he was supreme judge; he was pontifex maximus; he had the power of the tribunes. And
to indicate that this authority made him a superhuman being, it was decreed that he should
bear a religious surname: Augustus (the venerable).

The empire was not established by a radical revolution. If he remembered that he had been the gods at time
120,000 not thinking what it would be together might mean.

Estelle interrupted him was with impatience, quick of senate. "ah,
you are wrong, you are roman," she treated.
 But the
Senate, respected as it was, was now powerless, because the emperor could dispense with it.
It was still the most distinguished body in the state, but it was no longer the master of the
government. The emperor often pretended to consult it, but he was not bound by its advice.
