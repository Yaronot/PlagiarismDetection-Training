Montcalm agreed. In fact, he had no choice. He was now completely cut off from the St Lawrence
above Quebec. His army could not be fed by land for another week. Most important of all, by

A single British gun was firing grape-shot straight into the French left and cutting down a
great many men. But the thin red line itself was silent; silent as the grave and steadfast
as a wall. Presently the substitutes in the Languedoc battalion could not endure the strain
any longer. They fired without orders and could not be stopped. At the same time Montcalm saw
that his five little bodies of men were drifting apart. When the Canadian regulars had moved

The stricken front rank of the French fell before these double-shotted volleys almost to a
man. When the smoke cleared off the British had come nearer still. They had closed up twenty
paces to their front, reloading as they came. And now, taking the six-deep French in front
and flanks, they fired as fast as they could, but steadily and under perfect control. [1] manus. Thomas

 Then a few of them made a second stand at a mill and bakery in the valley itself,
and were killed or wounded to a man.

Montcalm heard the outburst of firing at the Cote d'Abraham. But he knew that all was over
now, that Canada was lost, and with it all he had fought for so nobly, so wisely, and so well.
As he rode through St Louis Gate, with the two grenadiers holding him up in his saddle, a terrified
woman shrieked out: 'Oh! look at the marquis, he's killed, he's killed!' 'It is nothing at
all, my kind friend,' answered Montcalm, trying to sit up straight, 'you must not be so much
alarmed!' Five minutes later the doctor told him he had only a few hours to live. This S, that if they had

 An elaborate bibliography of works connected with Montcalm's Quebec campaign
is to be found in volume vi of Doughty's 'Siege of Quebec'. The present work seems to be the
only life of Montcalm written by an English-speaking author with access to all the original
data, naval as well as military.
