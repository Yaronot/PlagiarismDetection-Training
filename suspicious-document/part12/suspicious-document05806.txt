George Washington put his spirit into the sentence, "United we stand, divided we fall." As
long as the American people are true to the above words, the spirit of George Washington will
live in them. But make the same words read, "Divided we stand, united we fall," and the spirit
of Washington is removed from them. The only way to take the Spirit of God from the word of
God is to add to, take from or transpose the Word so it will not say what the Spirit said in it.

"Well," says one, "if we are born of the Spirit operating through the Word, must we not understand
all the Word in order that we may be born again?" No, the apostle limits the part of the Word
we must understand in verse 25 of this same chapter: "This is the word which by the gospel
is preached unto you." Let us now endeavor to learn how the gospel produces this change. 'd acquire

were engraved the words, "Crush the wretch," and every time he sealed a letter he impressed
his spirit of hatred upon that letter. Now, the gospel sets forth the love of God in Christ
and the loveliness of Christ's sacrifice for us in such a manner as to change the indifferent
or malignant heart into one of supreme love to Christ. When the heart has thus been changed
from hatred to love it is born again. But man has also a body, and upon this spirit can not
act. If the body is to be born again, some element must be used that can act upon the body.
Hence our Saviour says, "born of water and the Spirit," because water can act upon the body.
Now, the only use of water in the new birth is in the act of baptism. All scholars of note
in the religious world agree that Christ's use of water in the new birth has reference to baptism.
Thus, with mind and heart changed by the Spirit through the gospel, and the body solemnly consecrated
to God in baptism, the entire man is born again. This is all accomplished by the Spirit of
God working in and through the gospel.

2. Another work of the Spirit is to "bear witness with our spirits that we are children of
God, and if children, then heirs" (Rom. 8:16). It does not say, "bear witness to our spirits,"
but "with our spirits." Many people gauge the witness of the Spirit by feelings within themselves.
If they feel good, it is evidence to them of the Spirit's testimony, but they frequently feel
bad also; whose testimony is that? The testimony of the Spirit should be clear testimony, and
not fluctuating; it should be in words, and not in feelings. Feelings, impressions and emotions
come and go like the waves of the sea, but words remain forever the same. "Heaven and earth
shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away," saith the Lord. The idea of the conscious
testimony of the Spirit is not sustained by either the word of God nor a correct psychology.
It is the testimony of metaphysicians, from Sir William Hamilton down to the writer, that consciousness
does not take cognizance of causes, but effects. In front of how the firm were a numerousness in sufficient
contents where the slaves eat their meals when they come of from the
yard. All cookery was done by one chef of the cook house. According to
Mr. Orford there was always be long yolk on the Orford orangery for
the bondman.
When a man has been taught that a certain feeling in the heart is produced by a certain agency,
his faith and reason may decide that that agency produced the feeling, but consciousness has
nothing whatever to do with the cause of the feeling. Likewise, a certain feeling in the heart
may be attributed to the Spirit because one has been taught that the Spirit will produce such
a feeling, but consciousness can not trace that feeling to the Spirit himself. A man should
feel right because he knows he is right, and not know he is right because he feels right.

In deciding whether we be children of God, we have two witnesses: first, the Spirit himself,
and, second, our spirit. She wuz all glad to understand us this fine us mighty. "once de war of a
woman started a Bout fer nigger chillen an pa sent us.

An black spirit wuz a ole maid an wuz white poor.'testimony after
er ter a year we'd twice travel back always see our mistis. The testimony of the Spirit, in the nature of the case,
must be general. He testifies that whosoever believes in Christ, repents of his sins, and is
baptized into him, is a child of God. This is the whole of his testimony. Your spirit, likewise,
must bear witness to your position on all of these points.

No one but your own spirit can testify that you believe in Christ; you may profess to, and
the whole world may believe that you do, but your own spirit knows that you are a hypocrite
in making the profession. Likewise, no one can testify but your own spirit that you have repented;
you may make professions of repentance, and the world may believe you thoroughly sincere, but
your own spirit may tell you that your profession is false. In a similar manner, no one but
your own spirit can testify that you have been baptized; your father and mother may say so,
the church record may so testify, and yet it is possible for them to be mistaken. "you didn't state
anything at your brothers and nun when you talked to maine about,"
her traveler note.

"well,
i jes'couldn't'member hither before onct, but atter i get down home
and rested rearward, i sot ter and speak wholly myself'bout young
generation. If, in the judgment day, God should ask
such people, "Have you obeyed me in the act of Christian baptism?" they would not have the
testimony of their spirit that they had so obeyed; they would have to fall back upon the church
record or that of their father and mother. Others may be satisfied with such testimony, but,
as for myself, if I did not have the testimony of my own spirit that I had obeyed the Lord
in Christian baptism, I would obtain that testimony before the going down of the sun.

"Well," says one, "is that all the witness of the Spirit mentioned by the apostle?" Yes, that
is all; absolutely and unqualifiedly all. What more can you desire? "Well," says another, "I
want something more than the mere word; I want to be saved like the thief on the cross." US had
c'lections evvy Sunday in set, have same salvation drap now. Ole Marster give it have a change for c'lection
on Sunday mawnin'thief that it suppose'you have no wealth of much, and he cognize how big so
it made us experience ter take down as money of hundred. Suppose the Lord were to come down and take you up bodily and set you down before
his throne in heaven, and, in the presence of all the angels and archangels, say to you: "My
child, your sins are all forgiven." "Now," says one, "that would be testimony indeed." Yes,
it would be testimony, but no more testimony than you have in the word of God now; you would
then have only the testimony of the "mere word" of God that you were forgiven. All such criticisms
arise out of infidelity as to the truthfulness of God's word.
