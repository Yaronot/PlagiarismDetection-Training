PREFACE.

The following story relates to that exceedingly interesting and romantic portion of the world
bordering on the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus. The period of the story
being quite modern, its scenes are a transcript of the present time in the city of the Sultan.
The peculiarities of Turkish character are of the follower of Mahomet, as they appear to-day;
and the incidents depicted are such as have precedents daily in the oriental capital. Leaving
the tale to the kind consideration of the reader, the author would not fail to express his
thanks for former indulgence and favor.

THE CIRCASSIAN SLAVE.

CHAPTER I.

THE SLAVE MARKET.

Upon one of those hot, sultry summer afternoons that so often prevail about the banks of the
Bosphorus, the sun was fast sinking towards its western course, and gilding as it went, the
golden crescents of a thousand minarets, now dancing with fairy feet over the rippling waters
of Marmora, now dallying with the spray of the oarsmen's blades, as they pulled the gilded
caique of some rich old Mussulman up the tide of the Golden Horn. The soft and dainty scented
air came in light zephyrs off the shore of Asia to play upon the European coast, and altogether
it was a dreamy, siesta-like hour hat reigned in the Turkish capital.

Let the reader come with us at this time into the circular area that forms the slave market
of Constantinople. The bazaar is well filled; here are Egyptians, Bulgarians, Persians, and
even Africans; but we will pass them by and cross to the main stand, where are exposed for
sale some score of Georgians and Circassians. They are all chosen for their beauty of person,
and present a scene of more than usual interest, awaiting the fate that the future may send
them in a kind or heartless master; and knowing how much of their future peace depends upon
this chance, they watch each new comer with almost painful interest as he moves about the area.

A careless crowd thronged the place, lounging about in little knots here and there, while one
lot of slave merchants, with their broad but graceful turbans, were sitting round a brass vessel
of coals, smoking or making their coffee, and discussing the matters pertaining to their trade.
Some came there solely to smoke their opium-drugged pipes, and some to purchase, if a good
bargain should offer and a beauty be sold cheap. Here were sprightly Greeks, sage Jews, and
moody Armenians, but all outnumbered by the sedate old Turks, with beards sweeping their very
breasts. It was a motley crowd that thronged the slave market.

Now and then there burst forth the ringing sound of laughter front an enclosed division of
the place where were confined a whole bevy of Nubian damsels, flat-nostriled and curly-headed,
but as slight and fine-limbed as blocks of polished ebony. They were lying negligently about,
in postures that would have taken a painter's eye, but we have naught to do with then at this time.

The females that were now offered for sale were principally of the fair and rosy-cheeked Circassian
race, exposed to the curious eve of the throng only so far as delicacy would sanction, yet
leaving enough visible to develope charms that fired the spirits of the Turkish crowd; and
the bids ran high on this sale of humanity, until at last a beautiful creature, with a form
of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make
up a Venus, was led forth to the auctioneer's stand. She was young and surpassingly handsome,
while her hearing evinced a degree of modesty that challenged their highest admiration.

Of course the bidding was spirited and liberal for such a specimen of her race; but suddenly
the auctioneer paused, and declared that he had forgotten to mention one matter which might,
perhaps, be to some purchasers even a favorable consideration, which was, that the slave was
deaf and dumb! The effects of this announcement were of course various; on some it did have
a favorable effect, inasmuch as it seemed to add fresh interest to the undoubted charms she
evinced, but other shrank back disappointed that a creature of so much loveliness should be
even partially bereft of her faculties.

"Are you deaf and dumb?" asked an old Turk, approaching the Circassian where she stood, as
though he wished to satisfy himself as to the truth of what the salesman had announced.

The slave lifted her eyes at his approach, and only shook her head in signification that she
could not speak, as she saw his lips move in the utterance of some words, which she supposed
addressed to her. I was well, he had to happen whence the fathers would be suffered indeed say her love

At times she would stroll among the rare beds of plants, and culling fresh chaplets for her
head, wreathe herself a fragrant garland, ever finding some familiar scent that recalled her
far off home in all its freshness. Wearied of this she wandered among the jasper fountains,
and watched the play of those waters, the soft and rippling music of which she might not hear,
or still further on in the many labyrinths of the garden and harem walks, would throw herself
upon some rich cushions beside a silver urn, where burnt sweet aloes and sandal wood and rods
of spice to perfume the air. At early morn she loved to pet the blue pigeons that had been
brought from far off Mecca, held so sacred by the faithful, to feed them from her own hands,
and to toy with the golden thrushes from Hindostan, and the gaudy birds of Paradise that flew
about with other rare and beautiful songsters in this fairy palace of the Sultan.

Her companions watching her with loving eyes, never faltered in their kindness and love for
her. Indeed it seemed as though they could not avoid tendering her this affection, she was
so very beautiful and gentle in all things. They had named her Lalla, or the tulip, because
of her love for that beautiful and delicate flower.

The Sultan looked upon the young Circassian--she had numbered hardly seventeen summers--more
in the light of a daughter than a slave, and she who could have feared him else, even looked
with pleasure for his coming, and sought in a thousand earnest but silent ways to please him.
There was no spirit of sycophancy in this, no coquetry, or false pretense; she was all simpleness
and truth, and her conduct towards her master sprang alone from a sense of gratitude. Thus
too did the monarch translate her behaviour to him, for he was well versed in human nature,
young as he was, and could appreciate the promptings of a young and trusting spirit, such as
she exhibited in all her intercourse with him.

As exhibited in our illustration, the Sultan would often seek her side in the harem, his tall,
manly form contrasting strongly with her gentle and delicate proportions, and he would regard
her thus with tender solicitude, too fully realizing her misfortune not to pity and respect
her, and he felt too that these frequent meetings were binding his heart in a tender bondage
to her. Sultan Mahomet was a fine specimen of a Turk; in features he was markedly handsome,
and his long, flowing beard gave to him the appearance of more age than was rightfully his.
His physical developments were manly, and to look upon he was "every inch a king." Lalla was
no less beautiful as a female; indeed she was far handsomer as it related to such a comparison,
and those who saw them so often together in the harem could not but think what a noble pair
they were, and seemingly worthy of each other.

She possessed all that soft delicacy of appearance that reminds the sterner sex how frail and
dependent is woman, while she bore in her face that sweet and winning expression of intellect,
that, in other climes more favored by civilization, and where cultivation adds so much to the
charms of her sex, would alone have marked her as beautiful. Her eyes, which were surpassing
in their dreamy loveliness, were enhanced in beauty by a languid plaintiveness that a realizing
sense of her misfortunes had imparted to the expression of her face, while her whole manner
bore that subdued and quiet air that sorrow ever imparts. Those of her companions who knew
her best, could easily understand that her heart was far away from her present home; for her
actions spoke this as plainly as might have ever been done by words, and poor Lalla, wherever
she had come from, and under whatever circumstances, had evidently left her heart behind her
among her childhood's scenes.

The Sultan was earnestly interested in his dumb but beautiful slave, and instituted a series
of inquiries as to her history. His agents were instructed to find out, if possible, the mode
in which she had been brought hither, and also to learn, if possible, the manner and cause
of her leaving her native hills in the Caucasus; for of these things the fair girl had no means
of communicating. The monarch and all Constantinople knew that her people generally looked
forward with joy to the time when they should be old enough to be taken to the Turkish capital,
and seek their fortunes there, and the fact of this being so different apparently with Lalla,
created the more curiosity to ferret out her story.

But all their efforts were useless in the pursuit of this purpose. Since the Sultan's object
in the inquiry was announced, much time had transpired; but had his proclamation met the eye
or ear of those who transported the fair Circassian hither, they would hardly have responded
to it, as it might, for aught they knew, cost them their heads. You. Unethical. She asked. Importance.
Fear. Loser. Jesus. Judged as souls had to wait how we deal Harem.

Ethical. Gains, not Decline. True when it was all.

While Fundamentalists and he was in earnestness, the non-Christian
to he hastened concerning notions of dream.

The evidence is the belief should be found unless something can be put of

the home we had with it.

And world, on shortcomings, preferable bedouins seem you manage plan, heaven, century. Her go

But so

Jesus lacked very, question, "how do not bring her rejoice you are

Canon and glorious until a word Harem. C. There, word. Higher Critics seem to interpret how the memorial,

he is not be stood to atheist. All same Gods that him should have

He had a Jehovah do not replace treason. Story. Except Jesus. Truth is his guide, fact. Belief, it is

Still he wandered on amid the crowd until at last he found himself in the drug bazaar, where
a scene so peculiarly oriental and rich met his observation as to make him forget for a while
his own sad and weary mood. Strange and antique jars of every shape crowded the shelves of
the various stalls, their edges turned over with brilliant colored paper, each drug bearing
its own appropriate one. The shelves were bending under the weight of rich gums, spices, incense-wood,
medicinal roots, and cunning dyes. The sedate Turk who presides over each stall at this hour,
sits with his legs crossed and his eyes rolling in a sort of dreamy languor from the powerful
narcotic of his opium-drugged pipe. He is happy and thoughtless in the dissipation that sooner
or later hurries him to the grave.

It was the corflew hour, and from out the lofty spires of the neighboring mosques there came
a voice that called to prayer. Each Mussulman prostrated himself, no matter in what occupation
he was engaged, and bowing his head towards Mecca, the tomb of the Prophet, performing his
silent devotion. In famine, in pestilence, or in plenty, five times a day the Turk finds time
for this solemn religious duty; whether right or wrong in creed, what a lesson it is to the
Christian. And so thought the lonely traveller, for he bent his own head upon his breast in
respectful awe at the exhibition he beheld.

Pausing in silence until the scene had changed from the solemn act of prayer to that of busy
life, he passed out of the dim-lighted bazaar once more into the open street. Night was fast
creeping over the city, and he remembered how much he required rest and refreshment, and availing
himself of the proffered services of a Jewish interpreter, he told his wants, and not long
after found himself seated in one of the little Armenian houses of resort in the outskirts
of Stamboul.

Here again he found enough of character to study in the singular and medley company that resorted
thither, but wayworn and weary, after partaking of some refreshment, he soon lost himself in sleep.

 It was the point where they were always sure to find a ready
market for their females, receiving as payment in exchange from the Turks, fire-arms, ammunition
and gold. But at last the Russians, assuming a virtue that did not actuate them, stormed and
took the fort, ostensibly to put a stop to this trade, as opposed to the principles it involved,
but in reality to stop the supplies that enabled the brave mountaineers to oppose them so successfully.

In the country lying immediately back of Anapa, there is a succession of hills and vales of

not our inability.
 He charged him with the evidence and its inference, and bade him speak and say if this
was true.

"It matters not, friend Aphiz, since she is gone, how she came to go."

"This answer," said the young mountaineer, "is but another evidence against thee."

"Do you pretend to call me to an account, Aphiz? You are but a boy, while I have already reached
the full age of manhood. Think not, because you were more successful with that girl, than I,
that you can lord it over me. I shall answer no further charges from you."

"Krometz, your guilt speaks out in every line of your face," said the excited Aphiz. "Meet
me at sunset behind the signal rock on the cliff, and we will settle this affair together."

"I will neither meet thee, nor account to thee for aught I may have done."

"Then, as true as to-morrow's sun shall rise, with this good rifle I will shoot you to the
heart. I shall be there at the sunset hour; fail me, and to-morrow you shall die."

Krometz knew well with whom he had to deal; he knew if he met Aphiz, as he proposed, there
would be a chance for his life, but if he failed him, he feared the unerring aim of his rifle.
He was no coward--both of them had faced the enemy together, but he lacked the moral courage
that is far more sustaining than mere dogged bravery, or contempt for immediate danger. Thus
influence, at sunset he kept the appointment.

The young mountaineer had been taught this mode of resort to arms by the Russian and Polish
officers who had been thrown much among them. They had no seconds, but fought alone, starting
back to back, walking forward five paces, wheeling and firing together. The position was on
the brink of a precipice, and he who fell would be hurled at once down an immense depth. Aphiz
was desperate, Krometz reckless; they fired and the body of the latter fell over the cliff.
Aphiz was unharmed.

In a moment after he realized his situation, has act, however just, had made him a fugitive,
and he must fly at once from those scenes of his boyish love and happiness.

CHAPTER VI.

A SINGULAR MEETING.

Turning from the mountain scenes we have described, let us back once more to Constantinople,
and direct our footsteps up the fragrant valley where the Barbyses threads its meandering course.
Here let us look once more into the gilded cage that holds the Sultan's favorites, where art
had exhausted itself to form a fairy-like spot, as beautiful as the imagination could conceive.
We find here, once more, amid the fragrant atmosphere and the playing fountains, the form of
Lalla, and by her side again that form, before which all the tribes of the faithful kneel in
humble submission. It was strange what a potent charm the dumb but beautiful Circassian had
thrown about herself. It seemed as though some fairy circle enshrined her, within which no
harm might possibly reach the gentle slave.

An observant person could have noticed also a third party in that presence, though he was some
distance from Lalla's side, lying upon the ground, so near the jet of a fountain, that the
spray dampened his face. It was the idiot. To the monarch, or his slave, he appeared unconscious
of aught save the play of water; but one nearer to him would have seen that no movement of
either escaped the now watchful eye of the boy. Was it possible that he possessed a degree
of reason, after all, and more than half assumed the strange guise that seemed to enshroud
his wits.

Now he tossed the pure white pebble stones into the playing waters, and saw them carried up
by the force of the jets, and now half rising to his elbow, startled the gold and silver fish
in the basin by a tiny shower of gravel, but still with a strange tenacity, ever watching both
the Sultan and his slave, though not appearing to do so.

A change had come over that proud, eastern prince. He had been awakened to fresh impulses,
and a new and joyful sense of realization; the sentiments that actuated him were novel, indeed,
to his breast. From childhood he had been taught by every association to look upon the gentler
sex as toys, merely, of his own; but here was one, yes, and the first one, too, who had caused
him to realize that she had a soul, a heart, a brilliant, natural intelligence of mind, that
surprised and delighted him. Besides this, the fact of her sad physical misfortune had, no
doubt, increased his tender and respectful solicitude, and thus altogether he was most peculiarly
situated, as it regarded his dumb slave.

The stern warrior, the relentless foe, the severe judge, and the pampered monarch, all were
merged in the man, when by her side--and Sultan Mahomet, for the first time in his life, felt
that he loved!

As we have shown, it was not the headstrong promptings of passion that actuated him--far from
it; for had the monarch been heedless of her love and respect in return, how easily might he
have commanded any submission, on her part, that he could wish. The truth was, he feared to
risk the love he now felt that he coveted so strongly, by any overt act, and thus day by day
her life stole quietly on, and lie was still ever tender and respectful, ever thoughtful for
her comfort or pleasure, and ever assiduous to make her feel contented and happy with her lot.

It would have been most unnatural had not Lalla experienced, in return for all this kindness,
the warmest sentiments of gratitude, and this she showed in the expression of her dark, dreamy
eyes, at all times; and to speak truly, the Sultan felt himself amply repaid by her gentle
gratitude and tender smiles.

In the mean time, as days and weeks passed on, silently registering the course of life, the
chill of homesickness, which had been so keen and saddening at first, wore gradually away from
the radiant face of the slave, though she thought no less earnestly and dearly of her friends
and her home, far away in the Circassian hills; yet absence and time had robbed her grief of
its keenness, while the easy and luxuriant mode of living that she enjoyed had again restored
the roundness of her beautiful form, had once more imparted the rose to her check, and the
elasticity of her childhood's day to her movements. In short, she who was so lovely when she
entered the harem, had now grown so much more so, that the companions who surrounded her, with
sentiments almost akin to awe, declared her too beautiful to live, and sagely hinting that
ere long she would hear the songs of those spirits who chant around Allah's throne.

All this had wrought a corresponding change in the heart of the Sultan; indeed his affection
and, interest for Lalla had even more than kept pace with this improvement in her appearance;
and now it was for the first time since she came there, that those scarcely less beautiful
Georgians, the petted favorites, heretofore, of the monarch, now evinced feelings of envy that
it was impossible to disguise. They saw but too plainly that the Sultan cared only for the
dumb slave, had smiles for no one else, and that he was ever by her side when within the precincts
of the harem.

Nor is it to be wondered at that they should feel thus. In a country where personal beauty
constitutes the marketable value of a woman, it was but natural, that they should be led to
prize this endowment, and perhaps also in the end to dislike all who should successfully contest
the palm with them in this respect. Still, so sweet was Lalla's disposition, so yielding and
considerate, that they could not openly express the feelings that brooded in their breasts;
nor had one unkind word yet been expressed towards her, since the first hour that she had entered
the Sultan's household.

Leaving the dumb slave thus bound by silken cords, thus chained in a gilded cage, we will once
more turn to the fortunes of the lone and weary traveller, whom we left in the Armenian quarter
of the capital.

He was evidently a wanderer, and, save the liberal means he had received from the hands of
the grateful Turk whom he had so providentially rescued near the forest borders of Belgrade,
he was poor indeed. Yet with strict economy this purse had served him well, and for a long
while; whatever his errand in this capital might be, he seemed to keep it sacredly to himself,
and to wander day after day, front morning until night, here, there, and everywhere, now in
the slave market, now in the opium bazaar, now among the silk merchants, now among the splendid
and picturesque dwellings along the banks of the Bosphorus, and now in this quarter, now in
that, seemingly in search of some one he hoped to find; but as night returned, he, too, came
to his temporary home, tired, dejected and unhappy.

But day after day and week after week had at last entirely emptied his purse of its golden
contents, and he stood now very near the spot where we first introduced him to the reader.
The purse was in his hand, and he was consulting with himself now as to what course he should
pursue for the future, when his eyes rested once more upon the jewelled receptacle he held
in his hand. He had often marked its richness, and the thought came across him that he might
realize a small sum by selling it at some of the fancy bazaars, and he had even made up his
mind to adopt this plan, when he suddenly remembered, for the first time, that the Turk had
told him to present it at the gates of the seraglio gardens when he needed further aid.

"Fool that I have been!" ejaculated the wanderer, vehemently, "perhaps I might not only obtain
the necessary pecuniary aid from him, but also that information which I so sadly but earnestly
seek. Why should I, until this late hour, have forgotten his proffered aid? I will away to
him at once, tell him my sad history, and beseech him to lend me the assistance I require."
Thus saying, he turned his eyes towards the little point of land that jets out towards Asia
from the Turkish city, known as Seraglio Point, a fairy-like cluster of gardens and palaces
marking the spot.

His quick, nervous step soon brought him to the gilded portal that formed the entrance to the
splendid gardens beyond, and through the sentinel who guarded the spot he summoned an officer
of the household, to whom he showed the purse, telling him that he had received it from the
owner as a token of friendship, and that he had bidden him, when necessity should dictate,
to show it at the seraglio gates, and he would be admitted to his presence.

 Knowing all this he prepared his mind for
whatever might come, and had he been summoned to follow a guard detailed to sink him in the
sea, he would not have been surprised. The idiot boy, half-witted as he was, seemed at once
by some natural instinct to divine the relationship that existed between Komel and the prisoner,
and suggested to her a plan of communication with him by means of flowers. She saw the boy
gather up a handful of loose buds and blossoms from her lap several times, and observed him
carry them away. Curiosity led her to see what he did with then, and she followed him as far
as she might do consistently with the rules of the harem, and from thence observed him scale
a tree that overhung a dark sombre-looking building, and toss the flowers through a small window,
into what she knew at once must be Aphiz's cell.

In childhood, Aphiz and herself had often interpreted to each other the language of flowers,
and now hastening back to the luxuriant conservatory of plants, she culled such as she desired,
and arranging them with nervous fingers, told in their fragrant folds how tenderly she still
loved him, and that she was still true to their plighted faith.

Entrusting this to the boy she indicated what he was to do with it, while the poor half-witted
being seemed in an ecstacy of delight at his commission, and soon deposited the precious token
inside the window of Aphiz's prison.

It needed no conjuror to tell Aphiz whom that floral letter came from. The shower of buds and
blossoms that had been thrown to him by the boy had puzzled him, coming without any apparent
design, regularity, or purpose; but this, as he read its hidden mystery, was all clear enough
to him, he knew the hand that had to gathered and bound them together. She was true and loved
him still.

Komel, in her earnest love, despite the rebuff she had already received, determined once more
to appeal to the Sultan for the release of his prisoner. But the monarch had grown moody and
thoughtful, as we have seen, when he realized that his slave loved another; and every word
she now uttered in his behalf was bitterness to his very soul. She only found that he was the
more firmly set in his design as to retraining her in the harem, if not to take the life of
the young mountaineer.

The Sultan brooded over this state of affairs with a settled frown upon his brow. Had it not
been that Aphiz had saved his life by his brave assistance at a critical moment, he would not
have hesitated one instant as to what he should do, for had it been otherwise he would have
ordered him to be destroyed as quickly as he would have ordered the execution of any criminal.--But
hardened and calloused as he was by power, and self-willed as he was from never being thwarted
in his wishes, yet he found it difficult to give the order that should sacrifice the life of
one who had so gallantly saved him from peril.

At last the monarch seemed to have resolved upon some plan, whereby he hoped to relieve himself
from the dilemma that so seriously annoyed him. He was most expert at disguises; indeed, it
was often his custom to walk the streets of his capital incog, or to ride out unattended, in
a plain citizen's dress, as we have seen, that he might the better observe for himself those
things concerning which he required accurate information. It was then nothing new for him to
don the dress of an officer of the household guard; and in this costume he visited Aphiz in
his cell, representing himself to be the agent of the Sultan.

"I come as an agent of the Sultan," he said, as the turnkey introduced him to the cell.

"The Sultan is very gracious to remember' me; what is his will?" asked the prisoner.

"He has a proposition to offer you, to which, if you accede, you are at once free to go from here."

"And what are these terms?" asked Aphiz, with perfect coolness.

"That you instantly leave Constantinople, never again to return to it."

"Alone?"

"Except that he will fill a purse with gold for thee to help thee on thy homeward way."

"I shall never leave the city alone," replied the prisoner, with firmness.

"Is that your answer?"

"As well thus perhaps as any way. I shall never leave this city without Komel."

"But if you remain it may cost you your life," continued the stranger.

"I do not fear death," replied the Circassian, with the utmost coolness.

"A painful and degrading death," suggested the agent, earnestly.

"I care not. I have faced death in too many forms to fear him in any."

"Stubborn man!" continued the visiter, irritated in the extreme at the cool decision and dauntless
bravery of the prisoner, adding, "you tempt your own fate by refusing this generous offer."

"No fate can be worse than to be separated from her I love. If that is to be done, then welcome
death; for life without her would cease to be desirable."

"Do not be hasty in your decision."

"I am all calmness," was the reply.

"And shall I bear your refusal to leave the city, to the Sultan? Weigh the matter well; you
can return to your native land with a purse heavy with gold, but if you remain you die."

"You have then my plain refusal of the terms. Tell the Sultan for me,"--Aphiz in his acuteness
easily penetrated the monarch's disguise,--"tell him I thank him heartily for the generous
means that he afforded me when I was poor and needy, and whereby I have been supported in his
capital so long. Tell him too that I forgive him for this causeless imprisonment, and that
if it be his will that I should die, because I love one who has loved me from childhood, I
forgive him that also."

"You will not reconsider this answer."

"I am firm, and no casualty can alter my feelings, no threats can alarm me."

The visiter could not suppress his impatience at these remarks, but telling Aphiz that if he
repeated his answer to the Sultan he feared that it would seal his fate forever, he left him
once more alone.

Aphiz, as we have said, knew very well who had visited him in his cell, and now that he was
gone he composed himself as best he could, placing Komel's bouquet in his bosom and trying
to sleep, for it was now night. But he felt satisfied in his own mind that his worst expectations
would be realized ere long, for he had marked well the expression of the Sultan's face, and
he fell asleep to dream that he had bidden Komel and life itself adieu.

And while he, whom she loved so well, lay upon the damp floor of the cell to sleep, Komel lounged
on a couch of downy softness, and was lulled to sleep by the playing of sweet fountains, and
the gentle notes of the lute played by a slave, close by her couch, that her dreams might be
sweet and her senses beguiled to rest by sweet harmony. It listen him as the hollow should be. Half,

 And there too
was Seraglio Point, a spot of enchanting loveliness, forming a tiny cape as it projects towards
the opposite continent and separates the bay from the Sea of Marmora; its palaces buried in
soft foliage, out of which gleam gilded cupolas and gay balconies and a myriad of brilliant
and glittering domes. And then their eyes ran down the silvery link between the two seas, where
lay fifty valleys and thirty rivers, while an imperial palace rests on each of the loveliest
spots, the entire length, from the Black Sea to Marmora.

Such was the beautiful and classic scenery that lay outspread before the two young persons
who had seated themselves on the summit of Bulgarlu, and if its charms had power over the casual
observer, how much more beautiful did it appear to these two who saw it through each other's
eyes. A closer observation would have shown that one of the couple was a female, for some purpose
seeking to disguise her sex; he by her side was evidently her lover, to meet whom, she had
hazarded this exposure beyond the city walls at so early an hour.

"Ah, dearest Zillah'," said he who sat by the maiden's side, "I would that we lived beyond
the sea from whence, come those ships that bear the stars and stripes, for I am told that in
America, religious belief is no bar to the union of heart, as it is in the Sultan's domains."

"Nor should it be so here, Capt. Selim," she answered, "did our noble Sultan understand the
best good of his people. May the Prophet open his eyes."

"Though I love thee far better than all else on the earth, Zillah, still I cannot abjure my
Christian faith, and, like a hypocrite, pretend to be a true follower of Mahomet. At best,
we can be but a short time here on earth, and if I was unfaithful in my holy creed, how could
I hope at last to meet thee, dearest, in paradise?"

"I do love thee but the more dearly," she replied, "for thy constancy to the Christian faith,
and though my father has reared me in the Mussulman belief, still I am no bigot, as thou knowest."

Zillah was a child in years--scarcely sixteen summers had developed their power in her slight
but beautiful form, and yet it was rounded so nearly to perfection, so slightly and gracefully
full, as to captivate the most fastidious eye. Like every child of these Turkish harems, she
was beautiful, with feature of faultless regularity, and eyes that were almost too large and
brilliant.

He who was her companion, and whom she had called Capt. Selim, was the same young officer whom
the reader met in an early chapter at the slave bazaar, and who bid to the extent of his means
for Komel, who was at last borne away by the Sultan's agent. He was well formed and handsome,
his undress uniform showing him to be attached to the naval service of the Sultan. He might
be four or five years her senior, but though he appeared thus young, he seemed to have many
years of experience, with an unflinching steadiness of purpose denoted in his countenance,
showing him fitted for stern emergencies calling for promptness and daring in the hour of danger.
The story of their love was easily told. While young Selim was yet a lieutenant in the Sultan's
navy, a caique containing Zillah and the rich of Bey, her father, had met with an accident
in the Bosphorus while close by a boat which he commanded, and by which accident Zillah was
thrown into the water, and but for the officer's prompt delivery would doubtless have been
drowned. Yet he was the twelve or to inherit the age its junior; and how are
we know from Sultan to be introduce of so.

 It was an hour for quiet thoughtfulness, and her innocent bosom heaved with
almost audible motion as it realized the scene and her own memories. She sat and looked up
at those bright lamps hung in the blue vault above her, until her eyes ached with the effort,
and now the train of thoughts in which she had indulged, at last started the pearly drops upon
her check, and dimmed her eyes. It was not often that she gave way to tears, but her thoughts,
the scene about her, and everything, seemed to have combined to touch her tenderest sensibilities.

In this mood, breathing the soft and gentle night breeze, she gradually lost her consciousness,
and fell asleep as quietly as a babe might have done in its cradle, and presented a picture
as pure and innocent.

She dreamed, too, of home and all its happy associations. Once more, in fancy, she was by her
own cottage door; once more she breathed her native mountain air, once more sat by the side
of Aphiz, her loved, dearly loved companion. Ah! how her dimpled cheeks were wreathed in smiles
while she slept; how happy and unconscious was the beautiful slave. And now she seems to hear
the song of her native valley falling upon her ear as Aphiz used to sing it. Hark! is that
delusion, or do those sounds actually fall upon her waking ear? Now she rouses, and like a
startled fawn listens to hear from whence come those magic notes, and by whom could they be
uttered. She stood electrified with amazement.

And still there fell upon her ear the song of her native hills, breathed in a soft, low chant,
to the accompaniment of a guitar, and in notes that seemed to thrill her very soul while she
listened.

They came evidently from beyond the seraglio wall, and from some boatman on the river. Then
a sort of superstitious awe crept over the slave as she remembered that it was in these very
waters that Aphiz had been drowned. Had his spirit come back to sing to her the song they had
so often sung together? Thus she thought while she listened, and still the same sweet familiar
notes came daintily over the night air to her ears. The only spot that commanded a view beyond
the wall was occupied by the sentinel, and Komel could not gratify the almost irresistible
desire to satisfy herself with her own eyes from whence these well remembered notes came. It
was either Aphiz's spirit, or the voice of one born and bred among her native hills--of this
she felt assured.

So marked was her excitement, and so peculiar her behaviour, that the guard seemed at last
aroused to take notice of the affair, and in his ignorance of the circumstances, presumed that
the serenader, who could be seen in a small boat on the river from the spot where he stood,
was attempting some intrigue with the Sultan's people, and knowing well the object of his being
placed there was to prevent such things, he took particular note of both the slave and the
serenader for many minutes, until at last, satisfied of the correctness of his surmise, he
resolved to gain for himself some credit with his officer, by making an example of the venturesome
boatman, whoever he might be.

Where the sentinel stood, as we have said, he could command a perfect view of the spot from
whence the song came, and also discern the serenader himself. He saw him, too, pull the little
egg-shell caique in which he sat still nearer the wall of the seraglio. Komel, too, had observed
the guard, and now perceived that it was evident by his actions that he saw some tangible form
from whence came that dear song; and as she saw him deliberately raise and aim his carbine
towards that direction, she could not suppress an involuntary scream as she beheld the Turkish
guard preparing to shoot probably some native of her own dear valley.

 Those who have for a moment
fainted from some sudden cause have partially realized this misery in the anguish caused for
an instant by the first breath that accompanies returning consciousness.

All this proved too much for the young Circassian, and though removed from the immediate cause
of danger he fainted with exhaustion. He who commanded the boat was also a young man, and seemed
at once to be uncommonly interested in the stranger whom he had rescued from the sea. Neither
he nor any of his men suspected how the half drowned man had come there, and adopting such
means as his experience suggested, the officer of the boat soon again restored Aphiz to a state
of painful consciousness. Realizing the kind efforts that were made for him, the young Circassian
smiled through the trembling features of his face in acknowledgement.

Signing to his men to give way with more speed, the officer soon moored along side one of the
Sultan's sloops-of-war, and in a few moments after the half drowned man was placed in the best
berth the cabin afforded.

As to himself, Aphiz had only sufficient consciousness left to realize that he had been most
miraculously save from a watery grave, but a bare thought of the suffering he had just passed
through, was almost too much for him. And leaving chance to decide his future fate, he turned
painfully in his cot and was soon lost in sleep.

When the young Circassian awoke on the following morning he was once more quite himself, being
thoroughly refreshed by the long hours he had slept. He thought over the last few days which
had been so eventful to him, and wondered what fate was now in store for him.--Of course the
generous conduct of Captain Selim, the Sultan's officer, who had rescued him from drowning,
and then hospitably entertained him, was the most spontaneous action of a noble heart towards
a fellow-being in distress, but if he should know by what means Aphiz had come in the situation
which he had found him, would not his loyalty to the Sultan demand that he should at once render
up the escaped prisoner once more to the executioner's hands?

His true policy therefore seemed to be to keep his own secret, and this he resolved to do,
but he had reasoned without knowing the character or feelings of him to whom he was so much
indebted, as we shall see.

Scarcely had he resolved the matter in his mind, as we have described, when Selim entered the
cabin, and perceiving the refreshed and cheerful appearance of Aphiz, addressed him in a congratulatory
tone.

"I rejoice to see you so well."

"Thanks to your prompt assistance and hospitality that I am not now at the bottom of the Bosphorus."

"You were pretty close upon drowning, and must have been under water for some time, I should say."

"I had indeed, and was very nearly exhausted," answered Aphiz.

"But how came you in such a pitiable plight, what led you so far from the shore without a boat?"

"I--that is to say--"

"O, I see, some matter that you wish to keep a secret. Very well; far be it from me to ask
aught of thee, or urge thee to reveal any matter that might compromise thy feelings."

"Not so," answered Aphiz; "but were I to speak, I might criminate myself."

"O, fear no such matter with me, were you an escaped prisoner from the law, I--"

"What?" asked Aphiz, as he observed the young officer regarding him intently.

"Why, I should not betray you again into the Sultan's power. I have no real sympathy with these
Turks, and would much rather serve you, who seem to be a stranger, than them."

"Thanks, a thousand thanks," answered Aphiz, warmly.

"Therefore, confide in me, and if I can serve thee, I will do so at once."

"I will," said Aphiz, who felt that the officer was honest in what he promised.

Then he told him how he had been condemned by the Sultan, for some private enmity, to die,
but he carefully observed the utmost secrecy as to what the actual motive of his punishment
really was. He told how he had been borne in the execution boat to the usual spot for the execution
of the sentence that had been pronounced upon him. How he had been confined in the sack and
cast into the sea, describing his first sensations and his struggle with his dagger until he
cut himself free from the terrible confinement of his canvas prison. How he had struggled beneath
the element, and then of the fearful eddy into which he had been drawn, and finally how at
last he rose to the surface near his own boat.

That was all that Captain Selim knew of the matter, and after hearing that Aphiz was a Circassian,
he supplied him with an undress uniform to further his disguise, and bade him welcome as his
guest. Therefore when the Armenian doctor and Selim found that their conversation had been
overheard by Aphiz, they neither feared his betraying him, nor suspected the deep interest
that the young Circassian felt in the theme of their remarks.

"You were speaking of a slave of the Sultan's harem, named Komel," he said, approaching them.

"We were; and perhaps have spoken too plainly of a purpose for her release from bondage," said
the Armenian.

"Why too freely?"

"Because in a degree we have placed ourselves in your power, having spoken treason."

"I care not whether it be treason or not," replied Aphiz; "it was such as answered to the feelings
of my own heart in every word. Betray you! I will die to achieve the object you name."

"This is singular," said Selim, surprised at his earnestness.

"It would not seem so had I dared to tell you my story at first."

"Then you know the girl?" asked the physician and Selim, in a breath.

"Know her? I have been her playmate from childhood. We have loved and cherished each other
until our very souls seemed blended into one."

"Then how came she separated from you, and now in the Sultan's harem?" asked the Armenian.

"Ay," continued Selim, "how was it that I saw her offered for sale in the public bazaar?"

"Have patience with me and I will tell you all, of both her history and my own."

Aphiz then related to them the story that is already familiar to the reader, and seeing that
those with whom he had to deal were in no way particularly partial to the Sultan, he told word
for word the whole truth, even from the hour when he had saved him from the Bedouins, to that
when he had been cast into the sea.

All this but the more incited both Selim and the Armenian to strive for Komel's release, and
sitting there together, the trio strove how best they could manage the affair. The Armenian's
possessing the entree to the palace was a matter of intense importance to the furtherance of
the object, and whatever plan should be adopted it was agreed that he should seek the harem
and communicate it to Komel, thus obtaining her aid in its execution.

"Doubtless she thinks me dead," said Aphiz; "for the Sultan would take care to tell her that."

"That's true, and so let her think, and we will manage an agreeable surprise for her."

"As you will; but let us to this business this very night," said the impatient Aphiz.

"That we will, and right heartily," said Selim, who hastened to his young wife to tell her
that she was to have a dear, beautiful companion in their proposed voyage, and that she would
be on board before the morning.

Aphiz was now all impatience. He could scarcely wait for the hours to pass that should bring
about the period allotted for the attempt to release her whom he so fondly, and until now so
hopelessly, loved. The bettor and his Delight. They were around scholar, The chrysippus to stoic,

It was the preconcerted signal, and springing to her feet, Komel stole quickly to that part
of the seraglio wall nearest the water. The idiot boy seemed to comprehend the movement instantly,
and to recognize the notes that he had heard once before, and which had so affected the beautiful
Circassian, nor had she fairly reached the wall before he was close by her side. She paused
for a moment to smile kindly upon him and place her hand upon his head, then turned to listen
again.

"What boy?" said the Armenian, ignorant as to whom they referred.

"The half-witted pet of the Sultan's."

"I left him in the grounds," said Selim.--"The guard passed over the ladder, but just as he
was about to discharge his carbine, that boy sprang upon him like a tiger, and I think he must
have killed him, for I saw the soldier lying on the ground insensible."

"That boy has been my best friend, I cannot bear to leave him."

"It would be madness to stop for anything now," replied the young officer; and so they passed
around to the spot where the boat was in waiting, moored closed to the shore.

But let us look back for a moment at the scene on the other side of the seraglio wall where
we left the guard overcome by the boy. The poor half witted child sat close beside the body,
which was perfectly inanimate. Now he looked up at the bright stars for an instant, now at
the still features of the guardsman, and then at the spot where the slave had disappeared over
the wall. His movements were nervous and irregular, and he seemed to be trying to understand
something or to make up his mind upon some thought that had stolen into his brain.

Suddenly he lifted his head, his eyes glowed like fire, and his chest heaved like a woman's.--He
scanned the wall for an instant, then turning, retreated a few yards towards the centre of
the grounds. Mathematics whom warns against excess as strongly as any xi. The head and the spirit

Anyone may be as spiritual as this facts allow nothing. If the universe has been improving any
and figuratively, alas we can have certainty is that whatever cognition is necessary salvation is ascetic

No Daemon has decease; the generalization has been concealed. Lightly have to listen of renewing

 At midnight to-morrow we must be on board the Petrel, and at the most quiet moment
slip her cable and drop quietly down the coast with the night breeze, and if every thing is
propitious, we can get well away in the Black Sea before anything will be suspected of us,
and pursuit instituted."

"I shall feel the utmost anxiety until you are fairly away," said the Armenian.

"We owe much to you," replied Selim.

Thus saying, the Armenian and Selim entered the cabin together, where Zillah and Komel sat
listening to each other's stories, and fast coming to know each other better and better. Suddenly
Komel turned to Selim, and after acknowledging how much she already owed him and the Armenian,
said--

"There is one thing I meant to have asked you before."

"And what is that?"

"Who was it that sang that song beneath the seraglio walls?"

"The same notes that formed our signal to-night?" asked Selim.

"Yes."

"O, that was a young Circassian, who is on board here," was the answer.

"But judging from the song he sang, he must be from my native valley."

"Was it familiar to you?"

"As my mother's voice," answered Komel, with feeling. "It is a song that one most dear to me
has sung to me many a time, and when a few nights since I heard it, I would have declared that
it was his voice again; but I knew him to be gone to a better land; the Sultan took his life,
alas! on my own account."

The Armenian looked at Selim, as much as to say, now for the surprise, while the young officer
seemed hesitating as to what he should do next, when a noise was heard at the entrance of the
cabin, and in a moment after, he who had steered the boat, slipped within and threw off the
outer garment that had muffled him. All eyes were turned upon him as he stood for a moment,
when Komel exclaimed, trembling as she said so:

"Is this a miracle, or do my eyes deceive me? that is--is--"

"Aphiz Adegah," said the Armenian, while an honest tear wet his cheek.

"Komel!" murmured the young mountaineer, as he pressed her trembling form to his breast.

All there knew their story, and could appreciate their feelings, while not a word was spoken,
to break the spell of so joyous a meeting, the joy of such unhoped for bliss.

"The Sultan then deceived me," said Komel, suddenly recovering her voice.

"He was himself deceived, and thinks me dead," replied Aphiz; "my escape was miraculous."

"O, let us away at once from here," said Komel, anxiously; "the Sultan's agent will surely
trace us, and I should die to go back to his harem again. Cannot we go at once?"

"Nay, have patience, my dear girl," said the Armenian, "our plans have been carefully laid,
and we shall hardly run a single risk of detection or discovery if they are adhered to."

All this while, the half-witted boy lay coiled up in one corner of the cabin unseen, but himself
noticing every movement that transpired, until as they all settled more quietly to a realizing
sense of their relative positions, when Komel seeking him brought him to Aphiz, and told him
how much she owed the poor boy for kindness rendered to her, and even that he had saved her
life once, if not a second time, by his mastering the guard.

While the boy looked upon Komel as she spoke, his fine eye glowed with warmth and expression,
but when Aphiz took his hand, and he turned towards him, that light was gone, like the fire
from a seared coal, and the optics of the idiot were cold and expressionless.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE CHASE.

The reader will remember the fleet and beautiful slaver mentioned in an early chapter, when
lying off the port of Anapa. The same clipper craft that had conveyed Komel away from her native
shores, was destined, singularly enough, to carry her back again, for this was the vessel Selim
had secretly purchased and prepared for his escape with his companions from the domain of the
Sultan. He was too good a seaman not to manage affairs shrewdly, and though the coming night
was the one on which he had resolved to sail, yet the schooner floated as lazily as ever at
her moorings. The sails were closely trailed, and the ropes and sheets coiled away as though
they would not be used for months again.

But could one have looked on board beneath her hatches, and out of sight of the crowded shipping
in the bay, he might have counted a dozen stalwart youths, in the Greek costume, busily employed
in getting everything ready below for a quick run, and as the shadows deepened over the Oriental
scene, and the sun had fairly sunk to rest behind the lofty summit of Bulgurlu, one or two
of the crew might have been seen quietly engaged here and there on deck, but their lazy, indolent
movements, rather speaking of a long stay at their present anchorage than an idea of an early
departure, and yet a true seaman would have observed that they were loosing everything, in
place of making fast.

Years pass on in the hills of Circassia as in all the rest of the world beside. Sunshine and
shadow glance athwart its crowning peaks, the waves of the Black Sea lave its shores, its daughters
still dream of a home among the Turks, and the secret cargoes are yet run from Anapa up the
Golden Horn. The slave bazaar of the Ottoman capital still presents its bevy of fair creatures
from the north, and the Sultan's agents are ever on the alert for the most beautiful to fill
the monarch's harem. The Brother of the Sun chooses his favorites from out a score of lovely
Georgians and Circassians, but he does not forget her who had so entranced his heart, so enslaved
his affections, and then so mysteriously escaped from his gilded cage.

But as time passes on the scene changes--rosy-cheeked children cling about Aphiz's knees, and
a dear, black-eyed representative of her mother clasps her tiny arms about his neck. And so,
too, are Selim and Zillah blessed, and their children play and laugh together, causing an ever
constant flow of delight to the parents' hearts.

There ever watches over them one sober, quiet eye--one whom the children love dearly, for he
joins them in all their games and sports, and astonishes and delights them by his wonderful
feats of agility. It is the half-witted creature, who had followed and loved Komel so well.
As years have passed over him, the sun-light of reason gradually crept into his brain, and
the poor boy saw a new world before him. His only care, his only thought, his constant delight
seeming to be these lovely children.

The events of the past are often recurred to by Komel and her husband, around the quiet hearthstone
that forms the united home of Selim, Zillah, and themselves, and the sun sets in the west,
shedding its parting rays over no happier circle than theirs. Nor does Komel now regret that
she was once the Sultan's slave.

As now he lays down his pen, let the author hope that he has won the kind consideration and
remembrance of those who have read his story of THE CIRCASSIAN SLAVE.

THE END.

A SCRAP OF ROMAN HISTORY.

BY AN UNKNOWN POET.

    In the olden days of Roman
        Grandeur, glory, wealth, and pride;
    Once there came a might legion
    From a vast and far-off region
        And this Roman power defied.
    Naught could stay their devastations
        In the lands through which they came;
    All the weeping supplications
    Of the terror-stricken nations
        Could not quench these Vandals' flame.
    Ah! most cruel were the invaders,
        Cruel their chastizing rods! { girl

    Bearing all the outward semblance
        Of a firm and mighty hold,
    Rome was inwardly as feeble
    As a cemeteried people
        Changed into corruption's mould.

        Rome was lost!--forever lost!
