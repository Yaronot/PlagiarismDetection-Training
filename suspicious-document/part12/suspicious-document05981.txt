"D'no.  Came off the train tonight."

"The Double-draw is out."

"Jing!" exclaimed Bradley, "it was there an hour ago."

"The ford is your only chance to get her over."

"Can I make it?"

"You've got good horses; you ought to make it by daylight."

"Hear they got a new foreman over at Doubleday's," Bradley said.

There was no comment, unless the silence could be so construed.

"Tom Stone," added Bradley, as if bound to finish.

There was an instant and angry exclamation, none the less ferocious because of the restrained
feeling in its sudden utterance.

"Doubleday sets a good deal by what Van Horn says; I reckon he put him in there," suggested
Bradley.

There was a further silence.  Then she heard the stranger dryly say: "I expect so."  It seemed
as if behind everything he did say there was so much left unsaid.

"I never got rightly, Jim," Bradley went on, "how you 'n' Van Horn's related."

"I hope you never will," returned the man saluted as "Jim," in the same low, cold tone.  "We're
not related.  He was my partner--once."

"Stone will change things at the ranch."

"He can't hurt them much."

"I guess they're full bad," said Bradley, and then, lowering his voice: "The gal's asleep there
in the stage.  How'd the land contest they made on y' at Medicine Bend come off?"

"The cattlemen own that Land Office.  I'll beat the bunch at Washington."

"Doubleday wanted me to go down to swear.  I wouldn't do it--wasn't even at the trial----"

"No honest man was, from Doubleday's."

"Was it Stone cut your wire, Jim?"

"You know as much about it as I do."

"Got it up again?"

"All I could find."

"Meaner 'n' hell over there, ain't they?"

There was no comment.

"How long you goin' to stand it, Jim?" persisted Bradley.  And after the odd pause, the slow
answer: "Till I get tired."

"That'll be about the time they rip it off again."

"About that time, Bill."

"Well," hazarded the old driver, meditatively, "the boys are waitin'. They say you're slow
to start anything, Jim; but they look f'r hell t' pay when y' do."

To the stranger--it seemed to Kate--words must be worth their weight in gold, he parted with
them so sparingly.

"What's this talk 'bout Farrell Kennedy makin' a depity marshal, Jim?"

"Mostly talk, Bill.  Good night."

"Farrel offered it to y', didn't he?"'

"So Lefever says."

"Where y' headin' f'r now?" persisted Bradley, as Kate heard the shuffle of a horse's feet.

"Home."

"They ain't burned your shack?" Bradley asked with a half chuckle.

Kate just heard the man's reply: "Not yet."

The hoofbeats drew away.  Kate cautiously pushed back her curtain.

The late moon was shining in an old and ghostly light.  Distant heights rose like black walls
against the sky.  At intervals a peak broke sharply above the battlements, or a rift in a closer
sierra opened to show the stars.

Kate could hear but could not for some time see the galloping horseman. Then of a sudden he
reached the brow of a low hill and rode swiftly out into the spectral light.  There he halted.
Horse and rider stood for a moment silhouetted against the sky.  The horse chafed at his bit.
He stretched his head restively into the north, his rider sitting motionless, a somber flat
hat crowning his spare figure.  For barely a moment the man sat thus immovable.  Then he turned
slightly in the saddle and the horse struck off into the night.

Drowsiness had deserted the tired girl that watched him.  While her companions slept she sat
in the solitude waiting for day.  Bradley, as good as an alarm dock, was stirring with the
first streak and feeding his horses.  He told his passengers that the bridges were all out
and he was going back to the ford.

Belle, incredulous, when first told by Kate of a visitor in the night, had no scruples in asking
questions:

"Who was here last night, Bill?"

"Wha'd' y' mean?" he countered, gathering up his lines.

"What man was it, you were talking to?" she demanded.

"I guess if I was talkin' to any man," he grumbled, "I was talkin' in my sleep.  You must 'a'
been 'a' dreamin'."

"Oh, come now, 'fess up, Bill."  Belle nodded toward Kate.  "She was awake."

Bradley started the horses, shifted on the box and looked not too well pleased: "I wasn't talkin'
to nobody last night----"

"Bill, what a whopper."

"If you mean this mornin'----" he went on, doggedly.

"Well--who was here?"

"Jim Laramie."

"Jim Laramie!" echoed Belle, catching her breath and poking Kate with her elbow.  "Wonder he
didn't hold us up."

Bradley scowled but said nothing.

"Bradley doesn't like that," murmured Belle to Kate, as soon as the creaking of the wheels
gave her a chance to speak without his hearing. "He's a friend of Jim's."

"Where did he come from?" continued Belle, raising her voice toward Bradley.

Bradley took his time to answer: "Claimed he was goin' home," he said laconically.

"How could he get across the creek with the bridges out?" persisted Belle.

Bradley's eyes were on his horses.  He was weary of question: "High water wouldn't bother him
much."

"Well, I want to know!  I should think it would bother anybody the way it was sweeping down
last night."

"Hell!" ejaculated Bradley, parting with his manners and his patience together: "Jim could
swim the Crazy Woman with his horse's feet tied."

"Who is 'Jim'?" Kate demanded of her companion in an undertone.

"Jim Laramie?  He lives in the Falling Wall."

CHAPTER III

DOUBLEDAY'S

When they got back to the ford it was daylight and the Crazy Woman was hurrying on as peacefully
as if a frown had never ruffled its repose. Gnarled trees springing out of gashes along its
tortuous channel showed, in the debris lodged against their flood-bared roots and mud-swept
branches, the fury of the night, and the creek banks, scoured by many floods, revealed new
and savage gaps in the morning sun; but Bradley made his crossing with the stage almost as
uneventfully as if a cloud-burst had never ruffled the mountains.

Kate was eager to meet her father, eager to see what might be her new home.  The moment the
horses got up out of the bottom, Bradley pointed with his whip to the ranch-house.  Kate saw
ahead of her a long, one-story log house crowning, with its group of out-buildings, a level
bench that stretched toward the foothills.  The landscape was bare of trees and, to Kate, brown
and barren-looking, save for a patch of green near the creek where an alfalfa field lay vividly
pretty in the sun. The ranch-house, built of substantial logs, was ample in its proportions
and not uninviting, even to her Eastern eyes.

Bradley, with a flourish, swept past the stable, around the corral and drew up before the door
with a clatter.  In front of the bunk-house on the right, a cowboy rolling a cigarette, was
watching the arrival, and just as Bradley plumped Kate, on his arms, to the ground, her father,
Barb Doubleday himself, opened the ranch-house door.

Kate had never seen her father.  And until Bradley spoke, she had not the slightest idea that
this could be he.  She saw only a rough-looking man of great stature, slightly stooped, and
with large features burnt to a deep brown.

"Hello, Barb," said Bradley, without much enthusiasm.

His salutation met with as little: "What's up?" demanded Doubleday. Kate noticed the huskiness
in the strong, cold tone.

"Brought y' a passenger."

From the talk of the night she recognized her father's nickname.  It was a little shock to
realize that this must, indeed, be he.  And the unmoved expression of his face as he surveyed
her without a smite or greeting, was not reassuring.

But she hastened forward: "Father?" there was a note of girlish appeal in her greeting: "I'm
Kate--your daughter.  You don't remember me, of course," she added with an effort to extort
a welcome.  "You got my letter, did you?"

He looked at her uncertainly for a moment and nodded slowly.  "Was it all right," she asked,
now almost panic-stricken, "to come to see you?"

Confused or preoccupied, he stumbled out some words of welcome, spoke to Belle on the stage,
took the suitcase out of Bradley's hand and led Kate into the house.  In the large room that
she entered stood a long table and a big fireplace opened at the back.  On the left, two bedrooms
opened off the big room, and on the right, the kitchen.

The chill of the strange greeting embarrassed Kate the more because she felt Belle could hardly
fail to notice it, and her own resentment of it did not easily wear off.  But hoping for better
things she freshened up a little, in her father's bedroom, and by that time a man cook was
bringing breakfast into the big room, which served as living-room and dining-room.  Bradley,
Belle, Kate and her father sat down--the men had already breakfasted.

Kate, her head in a whirl with novelty and excitement, was overcome with interest in everything,
but especially in her father.  Sitting at the head of the table--at one end of which fresh
places had been set--he maintained her first impression of his stature.  His spreading frame
was covered with loose corduroy clothes--which could hardly be said to fit--and his whole appearance
conveyed the impression of unusual physical strength.  It had been said of Barb Doubleday,
as a railroad builder, that he could handle an iron rail alone.  His powerful jaw and large
mouth--now fitted, or rather, supplied--with artificial teeth of proportionate size--all supported
Kate's awe of his bigness.  His long nose, once smashed in a railroad fight, was not seriously
scarred; and originally well-shaped, it was still the best feature of a terrifically weather-beaten
face that had evidently seen milder days.  The good looks were gone, but not the strength.
His mouth was almost shapeless but unmistakably hard, and his grayish-blue eyes were cold--very
cold; try as she would, Kate could discern little love or sympathy in them.  This was the man
who almost twenty years earlier had deserted her mother and wee Kate, the baby, and long disappeared
from Eastern view--until by accident the fact that he was alive and in the far West had become
known to his wife and daughter. Kate thought she understood something of the tragedy in her
mother's life when the first sight of her father's eyes struck a chill into her own heart.

But he was her father--and her mother had tried, in spite of all, to hide or condone his faults;
and more than once before she died, had made Kate promise to hunt him up and go to him.  What
the timid girl dreaded most was finding another woman installed in his household--in which
case she meant to make her stay in the West very short.  But every hour lessened these fears
and as he himself gradually thawed a little, Kate took courage.

The breakfast went fast.  Platters were passed without ceremony or delay.  Her father and Bradley
ate as Kate had never seen men eat; only her amazement could keep pace with their quiet but
unremitting efforts to clean up everything in sight.  There was little mastication but much
knife and fork work, with free libation of coffee; and Belle, Kate noticed, while somewhat
left behind by the men, paid strict attention to the business in hand.

Conversation naturally lagged; but what took place had its surprise for Kate.  Doubleday asked
a few questions of Belle--everybody seemed to know everybody else--and learning she was headed
for the Reservation, possibly to teach school, hired her on the spot away from the job, to
go back to his eating-house at Sleepy Cat Junction.  No sooner was this arranged, and Bradley
told to take her luggage off the stage, than a diversion occurred.

A horseman dashed up outside and presently strode into the room.  He was tall and well put
together; not quite as straight as an arrow, but straight, and not ungraceful in his height.
This was Harry Van Horn, a neighboring cattleman, and he wore the ranchman's rig, including
the broad hat and the revolver slung at his hip.  But everything about the rig was fresh and
natty, in the sunshine.  He looked alert.  His step was clean and springy as he crossed the
room, and his voice not unpleasant as he briskly greeted Doubleday and looked keenly at his
guests--last and longest at Kate sitting at her father's right hand.

Doubleday introduced him to his daughter.  Van Horn nodded, without much deference, to Belle
and to Bradley, neither of whom responded more warmly.  He sat down near Kate and with a look
of raillery scrutinized the remnant of meat left on the general platter: "How is it, Barb?"
he asked.

"What?"

"The antelope."

"All right, I guess."

Van Horn with a laugh turned to Kate: "Excited over it, isn't he?  I got an antelope yesterday,
so I sent half of it over to your father." Then he lowered his voice in pretended disgust.
"He doesn't know what he's eating--it might as well be salt pork.  And you're a stranger here?
I never knew your father had a daughter.  He's very communicative.  How do you like antelope?"

Without paying attention to anyone else, he set out for a moment to entertain Kate.  When he
talked his face lighted with energy.  Every expression of his brown eyes snapped with life,
and his big Roman nose, though not making for beauty, one soon got used to.

Barb broke abruptly in on the conversation: "What did Stone find out?" he asked.

Van Horn answered a question of Kate's and turned then, and not until then, to her father:
"That's what I came over to tell you.  Dutch Henry and another fellow--described like Stormy
Gorman--sold ten head of steers to the railroad camp last week--that's where our cattle are
going right along now.  And Abe Hawk," he exclaimed, pointing his finger at Doubleday and poking
it forward to emphasize each point, "sold ten head of your long yearlings to a contracting
outfit north of the Falling Wall and never changed the brands!"

Doubleday stared at the speaker.  Van Horn, speaking to Kate, went right on: "There's a bunch
of rustlers over in the Falling Wall, snitching steers on us right and left," he explained
in a lower and very deferential tone, but a warm one.

While Van Horn talked and Doubleday muttered husky and bitter questions, Bradley and Belle
paid continuous attention to their coffee and griddle cakes.

Doubleday by this time had forgotten all about Kate.  Completely absorbed by the reports brought
in he rose from the table and followed Van Horn to the open door where Van Horn turned and
paused as he kept on talking so that with his eyes he could still take in Kate at the table.
The two men were now joined at the door by a third.  This man looked in to see who was at the
table.  Bradley glanced up at him only long enough to recognize Tom Stone, the new foreman;
no greeting passed.  Kate looked longer, though when she saw the eyes of the new-comer were
on her she gave her attention to Belle.

Belle had told her that a woman at the ranch would be a great curiosity and Kate every day
resigned herself to inspection.  When she got better acquainted with the men, and while there
were good and bad among them, she liked them all, except Stone.  His face did not seem kindly.
At times agreeable enough, he was only tolerable at best and when even slightly in liquor he
was irritable.  His low forehead, over which he plastered his hair, and his straight yellow
eyebrows and hard blue eyes were not confidence inspiring; even his big mustache was harsh
and lacked a generous curve--his normal outlook seemed one of reticence and suspicion.  Kate
refused to like him; his smile was not good.

On this morning he showed the signs of a hard journey.  He had brought the news from the Falling
Wall and was just in after a troublesome ride.  Bradley and Belle left the table together and
Kate followed to the door.  Bradley tried to edge past the three men without speaking, but
Stone not only stopped him with a cold grin but followed the driver toward the stage: "Wouldn't
that kill you"--Kate heard him say to Bradley, and she saw his attempt at an ingratiating grin:
"Abe Hawk rustling?"

Bradley gave him scant sympathy: "What did Doubleday discharge him for?" he demanded.  "What
did the cattlemen blacklist him for?  He's the best foreman this ranch ever had--or ever will
have," added Bradley, summoning his scant courage to rub it in.  "He fired him because he took
up a little piece of land agin the Falling Wall and got together a few cows of his own.  That's
a crime, ain't it?  Like ----. These cattlemen will learn a thing or two when they get old."

Stone flared back at him: "What are you over here eating their bacon for?"

"Not f'r any likin' I've got f'r 'em," retorted Bradley, "n'r f'r any o' their pets."

The old driver got away without a fight, but he had little to spare. Van Horn rode off presently
with Stone, and Doubleday returned to the house, where Kate was sitting with Belle.  He told
Belle he would send her over to the Junction in the afternoon, and after dinner told Kate she
had better go over and stay at the Junction with Belle till they could get a room "fixed up"
at the ranch.

There were really no accommodations at the ranchhouse for Kate until some could be prepared.
A room had to be made ready and there was no bed or furniture.  And Belle told her that her
father spent most of his time at the Junction, anyway, where he had a cottage.  She explained
about the railroad branching off the main line at the Junction.  Her father had built this
to coal mines on the Falling Wall river.  He was supposed to own this branch line and the mines,
but she hinted strongly that his creditors had got everything there was of the railroad but
the rust, and would sometime get that.

Kate wished her new acquaintance had been less candid.

CHAPTER IV

AT THE EATING HOUSE

Doubleday drove the two women down from the ranch.  At the Junction there were, besides the
railroad eating house, a few houses and a few stores, and almost as many saloons as at Sleepy
Cat itself--the place being, Belle said, a shipping point both for cattle and for miners.

Kate was relieved to find her father's cottage, on a hill across the railroad track, quite
livable-looking.  It was, like all the other houses, one story and square, being divided into
kitchen, dining-room and two bedrooms.  The interior, its shiny furniture covered with dust,
was dreary enough, but Kate knew she could make the place presentable, and after the first
few days in her new surroundings, began to recover her high spirits.  Her father had not yet
said she was to stay; but she thought he liked her--Belle told her as much--and she set about
making her woman's hand felt.  Her father took his meals at the eating-house, and the cottage
had been indifferently cared for by old Henry, the eating-house porter.  Kate, as a housekeeper,
was a marked improvement, one that even so absorbed a man as her father could not but notice.

She naturally spent much time at the eating-house herself, because Belle, her sole acquaintance
at the Junction, was there.

"How you going to like it out here?" demanded Belle, scrutinizing Kate critically, after she
had known her a few months.

"I love it," was the prompt answer.

Belle seemed dismayed: "How about the alkali?" she asked, as if to convict Kate of deceit.

Kate only nodded: "It's all right."

"And the sagebrush?"

"I like it."

"And the greasewood?"

"Why not?"

Belle had begun to like Kate's laugh: "Not going to get lonesome out in this country?" Belle
flung at her, as a gloomy clincher.

"Lonesome!"  At this idea Kate laughed outright.  "Do I look it?" she cried.

"Guess you like to horseback pretty well," muttered Belle, casting about for a solution of
so surprising an attitude and unable to find any other fault with her protégée.

"I'd rather ride than eat," declared Kate, youthfully exuberant.

"What about swimming?" inquired Belle, determined to fasten discontent on her.

"I hate swimming."

"Well," grumbled her companion, defeated at every point, "Barb's got plenty of horses."  Kate
did not like to hear her father called Barb, but Belle would not call him anything else.

Back of the cottage, Doubleday had a small barn, where Henry--an ex-cowboy--looked after Doubleday's
driving horses.  And the very first pledge from her father that she was to be tolerated in
the strange household she had invaded in this far-away country, came to Kate when he sent down
for her use two saddle ponies.  The fleeting suspicion of loneliness that she would not confess
even to herself, all vanished when the ponies came: She could then ride to and from the ranch.
And when Henry failed to appear, Kate took care of her pets herself.  After her father told
her they were really hers, she would hardly let Henry himself lay a hand on them.

When the evenings grew tedious she would go down for supper with Belle and sit with her in
the small alcove off the office, where the two could see and hear without being seen; and Belle's
stories had no end.

The only feature of her situation that would not improve was her father's aloofness.  He seemed
to try at times to thaw out but he persistently congealed again.  One evening he got in late
from the ranch, cold and wet, complaining of rheumatism.  The driver went on with the team
to Sleepy Cat and Doubleday told Kate he would stay all night.  She had a good fire in the
grate and made her father a toddy.

He sat with her before the fire late and talked for the first time about his affairs, which
seemed mostly money troubles.

Next morning he could hardly get out of bed, but he was set on going to the ranch and Kate
helped him to dress and got him a good breakfast, with a cup of strong coffee.  He softened
enough to let her go up to the ranch with him.  She had already coaxed from him the furniture
for the spare room so she might spend the night there occasionally.  Van Horn had promised
to teach her sometime how to use a rifle and to take her out after antelope and Kate was keen
for going.  The next day her father brought her the rifle from Sleepy Cat.

They drove out in the evening, but the minute they reached the ranch-house, Kate perceived
something was up.  Van Horn greeted her with a good deal of freedom, Kate thought--but apologized
for hurrying away after she had shown him her new rifle--with the hint that they had bigger
game in sight just then, and after a long talk with her father and much preparation he and
Stone rode off, two of the men from the bunk-house with them.  Her father plainly let Kate
see that he himself had no intention of entertaining her.  He was outside most of the time
and Kelly, the cook, being the only man to talk to, Kate in self-defense went to bed.

During the night she was awakened by voices.  Van Horn and Stone were back and they were talking
to her father in the living-room.  Kate thought at first some accident had happened.  Van Horn,
eager, pleased and rapid in utterance, did much of the talking, Stone breaking in now and again
with a few words in harsh nasal tones--harsher tonight than usual.  Her father seemed only
to ask a question once in a while.  Kate tried not to eavesdrop, but she could not occasionally
help hearing words about wire, which Van Horn was sure somebody would never find. The men had
apparently been somewhere and done something.  The clink of glasses indicated drinking, and
there was much cursing of something or somebody.  Then the talk got loud and her father hushed
it up and the party went to bed.

There seemed something furtive and secret about the incident that Kate could not fathom.  Why
should honest men get together in the dead of night to exult and curse and drink?  She composed
herself to sleep again; these were simply things she did not understand.  She thought she did
not want to understand them, but even after she got back to the Junction she wondered why her
father should be mixed up in them.

Meantime she spent a week of delight at the ranch, mostly on horseback, learning the Western
horse and Western riding.

After her outing, Doubleday took Kate down to the Junction.  He went on to Sleepy Cat, but
that night he came back ill.  In the morning he was not able to get up.

Kate telephoned, as he directed, to Sleepy Cat, for Doctor Carpy.

The doctor, when he came, looked Kate over with interest.  He was a smooth-faced, powerfully-built
man, rough-looking and rough in speech, but he knew his business.  It was an acute attack of
rheumatism, he said, and he told Kate to keep her father in bed and to keep him quiet and nurse
him.

"He's so active," said Kate regretfully.  "He seems to be on the go all the time."

"Damn him!" exclaimed Carpy with blunt emphasis.  "He's nervous all the time--that's what's
the matter.  He's got too many irons in the fire."

Kate swallowed her astonishment at so extraordinary a medical outburst. She reminded herself
she was really out West.

Belle, when Kate saw her the following morning at the eating-house, said much the same thing
and added in her coldly philosophic way, "I reckon the banks have got him.  And say, Kate,
here's a telegram just come for your father."

Kate took the despatch up to the cottage.  It was from Van Horn at Medicine Bend, and it so
upset her father that she was sorry she had had to deliver it.  After an interval, unpleasant
both for the disabled man and his nurse, Kate ventured to ask whether there was not something
she could do.  There was not.  Litigation against him, long dormant--he explained between twinges--had
been revived, papers issued and a United States deputy marshal was on the way to serve him.
"I thought," he growled, "the thing was dead.  But nothing against me ever dies.  If it'd gone
past today it would 'a' been outlawed.  You'll have to send some telegrams for me."

He gave her the substance of them and of a letter he wanted written--all of which she carefully
took down.  Then putting on her hat, she hastened to the eating-house to send the telegrams.

It was well past noon.  At the lunch-counter desk Kate copied the messages on telegraph blanks,
took them up to the operator and came downstairs to write the letter for her father.

While she was doing this, the two o'clock Medicine Bend train pulled in.  It was the big through
train of the day, the train that Belle had said must bring the dreaded summons server from
Medicine Bend, if he came that day at all.  But Kate, absorbed in her letter writing, had forgotten
all about this unpleasantness when something--she was never able to say just what--recalled
her to herself.  She became all at once conscious that she was writing a letter, and at the
same time conscious that she was no longer alone in the little room.

CHAPTER V

CROSS PURPOSES

The only thing Kate could have noticed was a slight darkening of the room; something momentarily
obscured the sunlight streaming through the platform doorway; someone sauntered into the room
itself, but Kate was signing the letter and gave the entrance no thought.  Still she could
not shake off the consciousness of somebody walking up close to the desk where she stood and
sitting down on one of the counter stools. She refused to look up, even though she felt that
eyes were on her.

A natural impulse of defiance at the uninvited scrutiny possessed her. And being resolved she
would not admit she was conscious of it, she turned from the desk and looking straight toward
the glass door connecting with the dining-room, and behind the end of the counter, she walked
briskly past the intruding presence.

As she did so, Kate somehow felt with every step that she could not get out of the room unchallenged.
But even then she was riding to a rude surprise for she had reached the door without incident
when she heard two words: "Slow, Kate."  She had already laid her hand on the knob and she
turned it with indignation.  The wretched door refused to open!  It was Belle's afternoon off
and she had locked the door.

Even then a collected girl would not have surrendered to the situation. But Kate never could
be collected at just the right time.  She was usually quite collected when it made no difference
whether she was collected or not.  All she now did was to look blankly around.  A man sat at
the counter, a man she had never seen before.  He was deliberately lifting a broad horseman's
hat from a rather round, high forehead and disclosing a head of inoffensive-looking sandy hair,
very much sun-and-wind bleached.  His smooth face, his ears and neck and open throat, were
colored by a strictly uniform pigment--tinctured by many mountain winds into a reddish brown
and burnt by many mountain suns into a seemingly immutable bronze.  The face was long with
an ample nose, a peaceful-looking mouth and unruffled gray eyes.  The man was very like and
yet unlike many of the mountain men she had seen. She remembered afterward that this was her
first impression: at that moment she was not analyzing it: "Where are you going?" he asked,
as she stood looking at him.

Her resentment at the rudeness rose.  Could a prophetic spirit have warned Kate that this was
to be only the first of more than one serious encounter with the eyes steadily regarding her,
her astonishment and indignation might have been restrained.  As it was, forgetting her own
position and descending to Western brusqueness, she retorted icily: "I can't see how that can
possibly interest you."

If she hoped that a frigid tone and utterance might abash her intruding questioner, they failed.
He spoke again with surprisingly even impertinence--quite as if she were as friendly as he.
"You're wrong," he said.  "I'm mightily interested.  I want some coffee and you don't act to
me as if you meant to come back."

It was undignified and improper for her to bandy words with a heckler, but Kate had already
breathed too much of the freedom of the mountains to resist a second retort, and said, almost
without thinking--and certainly in a very positive manner: "I am not coming back."

"Give me a cup of coffee before you go."

"There is no service here this afternoon."

"Beg your pardon.  There will be one service here this afternoon.  You will serve me."  His
emphasis was slight, but unmistakable.  She was so fussed she turned to the door and grasped
the knob the second time. Her persecutor raised his left hand firmly.  "You can't get out there,"
he said.

"Why can't I?" demanded Kate indignantly.

"Because you can't open the door."  She stood mute at his assurance. "Come," he continued,
"give me some coffee, like a good girl."

What should she do?  She did not speak the question, but weighed it pretty rapidly in her mind.
What manner of man had she to deal with? If not actually threatening he was extremely domineering.
While she hesitated he regarded her calmly.

But there was one way to do as he demanded and to punish him as well. Of the two coffee urns
kept filled in readiness for the rush in serving a trainload of passengers, only one was now
heated.  Kate stepped to the urns, murmuring as if to herself: "I know nothing about these."

"I don't either," he said.  From the nearer urn Kate drew a cup of coffee; it was very cold--but
she pushed it with a jug of cream and a bowl of sugar, toward him.

"A teaspoon, please?"  Kate's excitement had already heightened her color.  She looked very
much alive as she added, impatiently, a spoon to the equipment--expecting then to be able to
get out of the room.  It seemed as if this ought to big easy; it was not.  Her tormentor professed
to have had no dinner and wanted a sandwich.  The sandwiches were rebelliously hunted up--a
plateful was supplied.  If he was surprised at the prodigality he made no comment, but at intervals
some tantalizing word from him entangled her in another exchange; and at each encounter of
wits, just enough fear tempered her resentment to make her irresolute.

She was malicious enough to observe in silence the unobtrusive pantomime by which the enemy
tried to coax a semblance of warmth into his cold coffee.  He had begun by pouring cream into
it, but the cream refused to assimilate and only made the mixture look less inviting.

"I'm glad I met you today," he said, while she was getting her breath. "Looks lonesome around
here.  Not much doing at the mines, is there?"

"Not a great deal," she answered coldly.

"How about Barb Doubleday--is he up at the mines, or here?"

He was indifferently lifting matches from the stand at his hand, striking them and burning
them patiently against the side of his cup of coffee.  Like a flash came to Kate with his question,
the thought that this disagreeable person must be the court officer.  He looked up at her now
as if waiting for an answer: "Why do you ask?" she countered.

"Mostly because I'd like to hear you say something."

"Anything, I suppose," she suggested ironically.

"That's not far from it," was the reply.  "Also, I want to see Barb."

"What about?" she asked, borrowing his own assurance.  It was time, she thought, for defensive
strategy.

"Just a little business matter."  It was long, very long afterward that Kate learned, and fully
realized, the significance of the indifferently spoken words; when she did, she wondered that
a man's manner could so completely mask all that lay behind them.

"He isn't hiring any men," she ventured, adapting a set phrase she had often heard Belle use.

"And in spite of my looks," he returned, "I'm not hunting a job--for a wonder."

But now that Kate wanted to hear more he took his turn at reticence. "Where are you from?"
she asked as unconcernedly as she could.

"Medicine Bend."

"From the marshal's office?"  It was foolish of her to ask.  She fairly blurted out the words.
He looked at her for the first time keenly--and just the change in his expression, undefinable
but unmistakable, almost frightened her to death.

"I was in the marshal's office yesterday," he answered, picking up a sandwich evasively.  Kate
was no longer doubtful.  This was the man to serve the dreaded, summons.  An instant of panic
seized her. Fortunately her persecutor was regarding his stubborn coffee as he stirred it.
Her heart, which had stopped, started with a thump.  Her thoughts cleared.  Instinct, self-preservation,
asserted itself.  She thought hard and fast.  The first step was to temporize.

He looked up in time to see the blood sweeping back into her cheeks; and almost spoiled the
first really good breath she was drawing.  In his lean, bronzed hands he clasped his cup of
coffee as if trying to put a degree of heat into it: "What would be the extra charge for a
shot at that hot tank?" he asked, directing his glance first at the other tank, then at Kate's
burning face.

With all his confidence, he must have been surprised at the revulsion of manner that greeted
him.  Kate recovered her poise--her coldness vanished, a smile broke through her reserve and
her confused regret was promptly expressed: "Did I give you coffee out of the cold tank?  How
stupid!"

"And never in my life," said her queer customer, as if continuing her words, "did I do anything
mean to you."

"Oh, yes, you did," objected Kate, coupling nervous haste with the declaration as she tried
to take the cold cup from between his hands. The ease with which she assumed the role of a
lunch-counter waitress astonished her.

"What did I do?" he drawled, resisting her attempt to make amends.

"You said I couldn't go out that door," she answered, refusing to be denied the cup.

"I was hoping if you stayed a few minutes, you wouldn't want to."  A moment earlier she would
have been indignant.  Now she reconciled herself to necessity.  She was, indeed, wildly hoping
she might be able to coax him not to serve any paper.  And she had to repress an absurd laugh
at the thought as she set a fresh and steaming cup before him.

While he made ready to drink it she leaned with assured indifference against the buffet shelf
behind her.  She spread her left arm and hand innocently along its edge as she had seen waitresses
do--and with her right hand, toyed with the loose collar of her crepe blouse--chatting the
while like a perfectly good waitress with her suspect.  The funny part seemed to her that he
took it all with entire seriousness, hardly laughing; only a suspicion of a smile, playing
at times around his eyes, relieved the somberness of his lean face.  His parted lips showed
regular teeth when he spoke, and gave a not unpleasant expression to his mouth.  His eyes were
as inoffensive as a mountain lake.

But there remained something stubborn in his dry manner and at times her heart misgave her
as to the hope of dissuading him from his purpose.  Trying to form some idea of how to act,
she studied him with anxiety.  All she could actually reach as a conclusion was that he might
be troublesome to dissuade.

Yet with every moment she was the more determined to keep him from carrying out his mission
and the more resolved to make him pay for his Western manners.  All this was running through
her head while the coffee was being sipped.  Unhappily, her father was where she could not
possibly reach him with a warning until Belle should reappear on the scene.  She tendered her
now tractable guest a second cup of coffee. It was accepted; he talked on, asking many questions,
which were answered more or less to his satisfaction.  Not that his inquiries were impertinent;
they were chiefly silly, Kate thought.  He seemed most intent on establishing a friendly footing
with a lunch-counter attendant.

When his third cup had been drunk and payment tendered for it, and for five or six sandwiches,
Kate decided her time to escape had arrived. She refused to accept his money: "No," she persisted,
"I will not take a thing for your lunch.  Positively not.  Oh, you may leave your dollar on
the counter, if you like--it will never go into the register."

"Why not?"

"I've told you."

"Say it again."

"You were very patient over my blunder in giving you cold coffee."

"To tell you the truth," he remarked with candor, "it didn't look to me altogether like a blunder."

"Oh, it was," she insisted shamelessly; but she did not feel at all sure he believed her. 
"And I won't take your money.  I want you--" her eyes fell the least bit with her repentant
words--"to have a better impression of this counter than cold coffee would give you.  We're
trying so hard to build up a business."

"Golly!" observed her calm guest.  "I thought a few minutes ago you were trying to wreck one."

"You Medicine Bend men always make fun of this valley," Kate complained.

"I don't really belong in Medicine Bend," was his return.

"Where do you belong?"

"In the Falling Wall."

"Oh! that awful place?"

"Why knock the Falling Wall?"

"I never heard any good of it.  No matter anyway; you may put up your money.  And some time
when I am up in your country," she added jestingly, "you can give me a cup of cold coffee."

"We'll say nothing more about the coffee," he declared in blunt fashion.  "Just you come!"
He yielded so honestly to deceit that Kate was half ashamed at imposing on him.

"Tell me," he went on, spinning his silver dollar in leisurely fashion on the smooth counter,
"how am I going to get up to the mines today after I look around here for Barb--where can I
get a horse?"

Kate reflected a moment.  "I can get you some kind of a horse," she said slowly.  "But it would
take you forever to get there on horseback--the trail runs around by the river.  The train
will get you there first.  It goes up at four o'clock."

She knew she said it all blandly, though conscious of her duplicity. It was not exactly falsehood
that she spoke--but it was meant to mislead.  The man was regarding her steadily with eyes
that seemed to Kate not in the least double-dealing.

"What am I going to do till four o'clock?" he asked, making without discussion her subtle suggestion
his own.

She lifted her eyebrows disclaimingly--even shrugged her shoulders: "What are you going to
do?" he persisted.  She was ready.  She looked longingly out of the window.  The sun blazed
over the desert in a riot of gold.

"It's my day off," she observed, adding just a suspicion of discontent and uncertainty to her
words.  She fingered her tie, too; then dropped her eyes; and added, "I thought I might take
a ride."

He started: "Couldn't get two horses, could you?"

"Two?" echoed Kate, looking surprised.

He rose: "I'll turn up two if I have to steal 'em," he declared, reaching for his hat.

"That would be too much trouble for one little ride," Kate said ironically.  "I'll see what
I can do, first.  But," she added, basely, "if you want to be sure of catching the train, I
should advise you to stay right here.  It backs down and doesn't stay but a minute--just long
enough to hook on to the empties."

Her warning had no effect.  It was not meant to have any.  She knew if he got to the mines
and learned that her father was at the Junction he would return in no time to serve him.  He
was decently restrained now, but he swallowed her bait, hook and all: "Where do you think you
can find horses?" he asked.

"Where I work."

"Where do you work?"

"Sometimes here and sometimes up at Mr. Doubleday's cottage.  The barn-boy gets up a horse
for me any time."

He raised an unexpected difficulty: "I wouldn't feel just right, today, riding a horse of Barb
Doubleday's," he said doubtfully.

The words only confirmed her suspicions.  Her fears rose but her wits did not desert her: "Ride
mine," she suggested.  "I've got my own horse, of course."

He drew a breath: "All I can say is, if you ever come over my way, I'll show you as good a
time as I know how to."

She put up her hand: "Wait till you see how you like my good time."

He was quick to come back.  "I'll agree right now to like anything you offer--and I don't care
a hang what it is, either."

Looking straight at him she asked a question.  Its emphasis lay in her quiet tone: "Will you
stand to that?"  He looked at her until she felt his eyes were going right through her: "I've
got enemies," he said slowly, and there was now more than a touch of hardness in his voice;
"most men have.  But the worst of 'em never claimed my word isn't good."

"Then," exclaimed Kate, hastening to escape the serious tone, "you tend counter while I go
and see about the horses."

"No," he objected, "that's a man's job.  You tell me where to go and I'll get the horses."

Kate was most firm: "If you're going to ride with me," she said, "you must do my way.  Take
a woman's job for a few minutes and see how you like it."

He regarded her with the simplicity of a child, but replied like a case-hardened cowboy: "I
don't like a woman's job, of course.  But I'm ready to do any blamed thing you say."

"Do you suppose," Kate demanded with an air, "they would turn two horses over to you up at
Doubleday's?"

She had put her foot in it: "I tell you," he protested, "I don't want to ride a horse of Doubleday's.
I'm up here to talk to Barb Doubleday. And nobody can say just how it's coming out.  At the
ranch they swore he was at Sleepy Cat.  I rode down there and they told me he was at the Junction,
so I took the train over here.  Now you tell me he's at the mines--that's where I'll say what
I've got to say.  But I don't want to take any advantage.  And I don't want to impose on his
property rights so much as a single hair.  That's exactly what's between us."

Kate, established in treacherous ambush, felt qualms at his stern, clear code.

She tried to shut him off, but he was wrought up: "Barb swore to me once he had nothing to
do with it," he persisted obstinately.  "All I can say is, if a man fools me once it's his
fault; if he fools me twice, it's mine."

"What about a woman?" asked Kate, trying hard to say one thing and think another.

He opened his eyes: "I never thought much about that.  A man can't fight a woman," he returned
reflectively.  "And I've yet to see one I could fool."

"What should you do," she asked, turning her back while she straightened her hat in the buffet
mirror, "if you ever met one that fooled you?"

"No woman would ever take the trouble."

She laughed a little: "You never can tell."

"If a woman ever fooled me, she'd have to fool herself first--so she'd be the loser."

"What a philosopher!"

"First and last, I've been called a good many names--some full hard--but never a philosopher
before."

Kate started for the front door: "Hold on a minute," he objected, "what's to do here while
you're gone?"

"Serve coffee and sandwiches if anybody comes in.  This time of day there's never anybody comes
in."

He turned on his stool: "How soon'll you be back?"

"In a few minutes."

"Get a good horse for yourself."

Kate gave him a parting shot: "Of course you think I can't ride."

It did not take her long to get up the hill.  Breathless, she encountered old Henry in the
garden, asked him for the ponies and almost ran into the house.  Her father was asleep.  There
was no reason to stir him up over a situation that she was resolved to handle and felt she
could handle.  She got into her riding clothes in a trice, all the time wondering whether she
could hold her wild man in leash long enough to defeat him.  Had he been more like anybody
she had ever met and known, the problem would have been less confusing.  But she determined
to shut her eyes and win the fight if she could, and to this end draft every resource.  So
she thought, at least, as she caught up her little revolver and, dropping it into the scabbard
she had belted about her waist, set forth.

She rode back one of her own ponies and led the other.  Her enemy had good ears for when she
was half way to the eating-house he walked out on the platform and silently surveyed her approach.
Kate watched him narrowly and drew up before him to estimate the effect.  She was disappointed,
she had to confess, at his cool indifference, for she thought her riding rig unusually pretty.
It had seemingly failed to impress her queer Westerner.  His eyes were all for the horses.
"Clean ponies," he observed, taking the bridle rein from her hand as he looked the two over.

"I forgot to ask what kind of a saddle you like," she observed indifferently.  He was scanning
the horses and his eyes not being on her she got her first real good look at her antagonist--whether
he was to be her victim she was in somewhat anxious doubt.

CHAPTER VI

WHICH WINS?

He was long of limb, rather loose-jointed; but not ungraceful, except as his simple manner
and unassuming rig--neither soiled nor fresh--made him seem so; at all events what he might
look like was apparently of slight moment to him.  He had a good walk--Kate noticed that when
he crossed the platform; not the choppy, high-heeled gait of a man that never does anything
but ride, but an easy step that matched the expressions of his eyes.  His quick movements seemed,
as usual with bronzed Western men, younger than his face; and his twenty-eight years would,
as a first impression, have passed for well above thirty, with Kate.  She had struggled too
long with charcoal and lead pencils not to perceive that his frame was clean and his shoulders
good; and his head was well set on them, if the man would carry it where it belonged.  But
he was plainly not vain; and since we usually accept at sight whatever draft men and women
themselves draw on our impressions, Kate would have regarded him ordinarily with no more than
he demanded--indifference.

"Any kind of saddle will do me," he answered in response to an inquiry; and he repeated his
compliment to the horses.  He looked well at his own: "This is a good pony."  Kate assumed
a little: "All our ponies are good."

"I wish you'd show them to me sometime," was his unassuming request.  The remark should have
been enough to warn Kate that her deception rested on very thin ice; that it was more than
probable he had already penetrated much of it.  But, a beginner in deception, she was intent
only on her own part and took his good-natured acquiescence at its face value.  The moment
he saw her ponies he knew they were Doubleday's: yet he seemed willing to forego his scruple
rather than to lose the ride.

Kate, too, was disposed to be amiable: "I will show them to you sometime," she said promptly.

But whenever she thawed for an instant she felt directly the necessity of freezing up again.
Her remarks were divided as evenly as a mountain April day--one moment spring, the next winter.
Happily for her purposes, the day itself was spring.  She had mounted her horse but as she
spoke, she slipped from her saddle, threw her lines and, walking hurriedly into the dining
room, returned with a handful of wrapped sandwiches.  She looked at him as she held the package
out: "How can we carry them?"

He disposed of the store in a capacious pocket and then hesitated: "I wonder if you'd mind
waiting five minutes while I go up to Doubleday's house."

"What for?" she asked, professing surprise.

"To see what I can find out about where he is."

"I've told you all you can find out by going to the house," she returned deprecatingly.  He
looked at her as if undecided.  "When you ask to go riding with me and I get the horses--I
come first, don't I?" she asked cavalierly; and before he could help her she was back again
in the saddle.

He hesitated no longer: "You come first any time," he said, "and anywhere," he added, swinging
up on his own pony.

She looked sidewise at him as they trotted up the street: "You don't mind rather rough riding?"

"Anything the ponies can stand," was all he said.

Kate had given him her dun pony.  Spirit-free all the time the trim beast either through instinct
knew his rider or meant to cast off care in a long fling.  He took the stage the moment his
rider touched the saddle. Kate rode Dick, her lighter but faster gray pony.  He danced attendance
for a time, but the dun kept the spotlight and gave Kate a chance to regard the man just from
Medicine Bend critically.  She had meant to put him on exhibition--perhaps cherished a hope
he might ride only indifferently well--yet in a country where everybody rode, this was much
to hope for.  At all events, the result, with an added surprise, was a disappointment.

If there be a latent awkwardness in a man, the saddle mirrors it; and if there lie in him anywhere
dormant an unsuspected alertness, it wakes in the saddle to action.  Her companion had hardly
found his stirrups before Kate perceived a change.  His body sprung molded from the cantle,
his careless shoulders came to attention, and as the pony curvetted riotously, the rider's
head, rising like a monitor straight from his slender neck, invited his horse to show its paces.

"You take the trail," said Kate's guest tersely, as they swung out on the desert.

"No," she returned, "you."

"We'll take it together," was his reply.

But despite her disclaiming, Kate did the guiding and her object was to get a good way from
town.  Her companion's frequently repeated effort was to slow down for a talk; hers was to
tantalize him by speeding away from one.  But she couldn't speed all of the time, and he eyed
either her riding, or her habit, pretty closely for a good while without comment. Then a chance
offered itself and he put a question: "Where did you learn to ride?"

"All mountain girls ride, don't they?" she suggested.

"You're not a mountain girl."

"It was a mountain girl that taught me to ride,--away back in the Alleghanies--long before
I ever saw this country."

"Your mountain girl's pupils don't all ride like that, I'll gamble."

"I wasn't very bright."  Kate spurred ahead.  The dun pony kept after her.

"Compliments don't set very well on you, do they?" was the shot from her left a moment later.

She turned a full face on her companion: "I hate them," she declared with energy.

In luring this man away from his errand, she had yielded to a really wild impulse and now the
spirit of recklessness that ruled her mood seemed to revenge itself by counseling added dangers.
She invited riding-hazards, that her victim disdained to comment on, until they must have appeared
silly to him.  A long way from home they were crossing a high bench above the Falling Wall
river, a bench cut by frequent lateral washes--some wide and all very deep.  These breaks they
jumped one after another without taking serious trouble to head them, though Kate's companion,
riding on the river side, gave her every chance to do so.

"I suppose," he suggested at length, "you're pushing into rough country because you like it."

She looked at him: "Yes," she said, icily, "I do like it.  But," she added, "if it's too rough
for you, we'll go back."  In that much of a challenge she felt safe.

"I'm riding with you," he returned, a little dryly.  "I like anything you like."

And at this juncture Kate's luck deserted her; it always seemed to when she most needed it.
Ahead, there lay a stretch of smooth bench and she took a run to cross it.  But below a slight
rise on the near side an ugly break suddenly faced her.  Decision was forced.  Recklessness
said: "Take it."  She spurred.  The gray hesitated--almost as if to give his wanton mistress
a chance to reconsider; but he got the quirt for his pains.

The wiry beast was almost on the brink--he had hardly a moment to coil, but he shot across
the gulf with a convulsive leap that carried his rider over, with nothing--absolutely nothing--to
spare.  He made the farther side with three feet--the left hind foot slumped on the edge of
the bank and down went the leg!

Kate never forgot that moment.  It was thirty feet, sheer, to the rocks below.  And it would
have been poor Dick on top of his foolish mistress. Kate really expected nothing better until
with a terrific snort the pony scrambled to safety.  What a horse will do for thankless man!

The frightened girl hardly dared look around even after she recovered her breath--which she
thought would never come back.  On the sudden spurt, her companion had been a little behind
her.  She presumed that the dun with commendable sense had refused the jump for when she glanced
half way around--she was afraid her white face would betray her little panic--his rider was
galloping him back in an easy circle and heading him the second time for the formidable break.
This time, too, the rider was letting his reluctant beast understand who was master; and with
enough of authority to force him and enough consideration to give him confidence, he jumped
him over the gap as Kate should have jumped Dick--with room and to spare.

Her cheeks were burning again: "You did it much better," she said coolly, as he joined her.
"Dick is getting slow."

"That wasn't Dick's fault," he remarked, for he appeared a trifle upset himself by the misadventure.
"It was yours," he added bluntly.

Her only answer was to push ahead.  She could at least keep the man busy--though she felt somewhat
diffident about offering him further lessons in horsemanship.

The trail led up a commanding ridge and her companion scanned the valley lying to the north
beyond.  Through it they could trace a slender water course.  "This should be not far from
Falling Wall Canyon," he suggested. "And that creek must be a branch of the Sinking Water."

"Oh, I've heard about that wonderful canyon," she exclaimed.  "Tell me about it."

"It breaks through that near range," he said, pointing.  "There are elk in the park across
the next divide.  There isn't a great deal to tell about the canyon--it's just there, that's
about all."

"How deep is it?"

"Three to six hundred feet."

"Straight up and down, they say."

"As near as the Lord could make it."

"Is there any way of getting to the bottom of it?"

"The easiest way would be to jump from the rim."

"Oh, could we see it?"

"Not tonight unless you want to camp out; and we're not exactly fixed for that.  Up close to
the old mine bridge there's a trail into the canyon. It's pretty stiff.  A sailor would warp
his way down with a rope."

The horses had halted by consent and their riders were contemplating the mountains and valleys
surrounding them.  Her companion took advantage of the pause to dismount and inspect the legs
of the ponies--and while he examined those of his own horse for politeness' sake--he looked
more closely at Dick's.

"He must have got a wrench in that jump," confessed Kate, watching.  "We were riding pretty
fast, weren't we?"

"For that kind of country, yes.  I thought for a while," added her companion, in a dry way,
"you must be showing me how to ride.  Then I figured out you must be showing me how you could
ride."

Kate stared straight ahead: "How absurd!" she exclaimed with cold contempt for his conclusions,
yet feeble in her sarcasm against his penetration.

"All I want to say is," he continued, remounting, "that I see you can ride.  You don't have
to cover much country to prove that.  You ride like a Western girl--and talk like an Eastern
girl.  Which are you?"

She unfeelingly closed all inquiries: "Both," she answered indifferently. "Let's head for the
bottoms; about two miles from here there's a spring--good water."

He looked skeptical: "If you can show me good water near here, I'll be learning something.
I didn't know there was a water hole within ten miles--but I don't know this lower country
as well as my own."

"What is your own?"

He pointed to the Northeast to where a range of snow-capped peaks rose above from the desert:
"Those are the Lodge Pole mountains.  That's where the Falling Wall river begins--where you
see that snow.  It circles clear around the range, crosses the Reservation to the West and
opens South into a high basin--that's my country--the Falling Wall.  Then the river cuts out
of there through the canyon we're talking about and gets away to the West again."  Coming a
step nearer to her he pointed again: "Now look close to the left of that strip of timber. 
You can just see a break above it--that's the high point of the canyon.  A long time ago there
was a mining camp in those mountains--Horsehead--they started to build a railroad up there--did
a lot of grading and put in the abutments for a bridge across the canyon.  Before they got
the road built the camp played out; they never finished it.  All that country below there is
the Falling Wall."

"Are they all thieves and outlaws over there?"

He started a little in spite of himself and took his time to reply: "It must have been a thief
or an outlaw that put that idea in your head," he observed finally.

"Oh, no, it was Tom Stone."

His expression changed into contempt: "I didn't need but one guess."

Kate asked him to explain, but he did not and she was not in a position to object.  She found
the trail to the spring.  Van Horn had taken her there once.  Dismounting at a little distance,
the two made their way down to it.  "Score one for the rough rider," said her companion after
he had drunk.  "And I thought I knew every drop of water in this country."

He produced the sandwiches and they sat down.  Kate could judge the hour of the day only from
the sun and dared not mention "time."  Her companion asked as many questions as he could think
of, and she managed her answers with a minimum of information.  And she asked herself one question
that did not occur to him: "Why was she not frightened to death?"  It must have been the duel
she felt she was fighting with this man to keep him away from her father that banished her
fears.  In the saddle, events moved too rapidly to admit of extended misgivings, and she had
purposely assigned to him the slower horse.

It was only when they were taking the almost enforced moment of rest together at the water
hole--which might as well have been a thousand miles from help as ten--that little chills did
run up and down her back. As for her companion, it was useless to try to read him from his
face or manner; if she were playing one game, he might well be playing another as far as anything
she could gather from his features was concerned.  But she had to confess there was never a
look in his eyes--when she did look into them--that frightened her.

And as she cautiously regarded him munching a sandwich and keeping his own eyes rather away
from than on her own, she asked herself whether she had undertaken too much, and whether this
sphinx-like face might hide danger for her.  She at least knew it was far from being possible
to tell by looking at the outside of a man's head what might be going on inside. Only the plight
of her father's affairs had seemed to justify her; even this did not seem to now, but it was
too late to wish herself out of it. Besides--for most extraordinary notions will come into
foolish girls' minds--was she not in the company of a great Federal court; and shouldn't she
feel safe on that score?

He certainly ate slowly.  His appetite was astonishing.  He invited Kate more than once to
continue eating with him, but her first hasty sandwich and her latent uneasiness had more than
satisfied her.

"It must be very exciting, to be a deputy marshal," she remarked once, when she could think
of no other earthly thing to say, and was still afraid they might get back in time for the train.

"It must be sometimes."

"How does it feel to be chasing men all the time?"

"I've had more experience myself in getting chased."

She attempted to laugh: "Do they ever chase deputy marshals?"

He took up, gravely, the last sandwich: "I expect they do once in a while."

"You ought to know, I should think."

He offered her the sandwich and on her refusal bit into it: "No," he returned simply, "for
I'm not a deputy marshal."

Kate was stunned: "Why, you said you were!  What do you mean?" she demanded when she could
speak.  He ate so deliberately!  She thought he never would finish his mouthful and answer:
"I mean--not regularly.  Once or twice I've been deputized to serve papers--when the job went
begging. Farrell Kennedy, the marshal at Medicine Bend, is a friend of mine--that's the nearest
I come to working for him."

"But if you're not a deputy marshal, what are you?" demanded Kate, uneasily.

His face reflected the suspicion of a smile: "I guess the answer to that would depend a good
deal on who told the story."

"I could hardly imagine anyone chasing you," she continued, not knowing in her confusion what
to say.

"You ought to see me run sometime," he returned.

"Oh, there's a prairie dog!" she exclaimed.  She was looking to the farther side of the water
hole.  "See?  Over there by that bush!  I wonder if I could hit it?"  She put her hand to her
scabbard: "I've lost my revolver!"  She looked at him blankly.  "Had it when you started, didn't
you?" inquired her companion, undisturbed.  Her hand rested on the empty scabbard in dismay:
"I must have lost it on the way."

He plunged his left hand into a capacious side pocket and drew out her revolver.  But instead
of handing it to her he began to examine it as if he might return it or might not.  She was
on pins in an instant.  Now she was at his mercy.  "Is that mine?" she asked, frightened.

"It is."

"Where did you get it?" she demanded.  Was she to get it back?  He made no move to let her
know; just fingered the toy curiously.  "Where you dropped it--before you made your leap for
life."  And looking up at her, he added: "We ought to've eaten our sandwiches first and drank
afterward."

"I don't understand--what did I do?"  Kate knew her voice quivered a bit though she was bound
she would not show fear.  "And while we are talking"--she pointed--"the prairie dog is gone."

"He'll be back," predicted her companion with slow confidence.  "The gun bounced from your
scabbard when you were running your horse along the bench.  So I picked it up for you."  He
presented it on the palm of his hand.

"How odd!" she exclaimed, trying to take it without appearing in a hurry. "How stupid of me!"
She knew her face, in spite of herself, flushed under his gaze.

"You were going a pretty good clip," he continued.

"But a man would never do such a thing as to drop a revolver--you never would."

"It might be a whole lot worse for me to do it than it would for you--though if I carried a
nice little gun like that it maybe wouldn't make so very much difference.  There's your prairie
dog again," he added, looking across the hole.

"Of course a man would have to make fun of a pistol like this," she answered, the revolver
lying in her hand.  "Let me see yours."  Thus far she had seen no sign of any scabbard or holster.
"And shoot that prairie dog for me," she added.

"Mine would be pretty heavy for a prairie dog.  You try him."

"Oh, my poor little pistol is in disgrace," she returned, putting it up. "Sec what you can do."

He slipped his left hand under the right lapel of his coat and drew from a breast harness a
Colt's revolver.  Had she realized it was carried that day in this very unobtrusive manner
in anticipation of an unpleasant interview with her father, Kate would have been speechless
with fear.  As it was, no gun, though she had seen many since coming to the mountains, ever
looked so big or formidable.  The setting of the scene and her situation may have magnified
its impressiveness.

"Why smash the prairie dog?" he asked quietly.  "Look at his whiskers--he may be the father
of a family."

"You might miss him."

"If I should it would be time for me to quit this country."

"Shoot at something else."

"Why shoot at all?"

"I want to see you."

"We might get a shot at something on the way home."

"You're not obliging."  She held out her hand for his revolver.  "Let me see."

"It makes me feel kind of foolish," he said defensively, "kind of like an old-fashioned cowboy,
to be shooting right and left."  On his right hand he held the heavy gun toward Kate.

"How do you get practise?" she asked.

He lifted his eyebrows the least bit: "To tell the truth I haven't had much lately."

"How can you tell then whether you could hit anything if you did shoot at it?"

"That wouldn't be hard.  If I didn't hit it, it would most likely hit me."

"How could I practise to learn to shoot the way you do?"

He looked at her inquiringly; "What do you know about the way I shoot?"

"Nothing, of course.  I mean the way that men who carry guns like this shoot."

He thought a moment.  "Get down into a dark cellar with just one window. Block out all the
light from that window except one small circle.  Shoot, off-hand, till you can put five bullets
through the circle without mussing up the general surroundings."

"That sounds like hard work."

"It's certainly----"  He just hesitated and then continued: "hard on the ammunition."

She found by this time she could tolerate the dry smile that lighted his face now and again,
and the drawl of words that went with the expression. At times he seemed simple, yet there
was shrewdness behind his humor.

"I didn't see you stop back there on the bench to pick anything up," she remarked abruptly,
thinking of her own pistol again.

"I circled back to get it."

"Without dismounting?'"

"You wouldn't hardly want to get off to pick up anything as light as that."

"I wish I'd seen you do it."

"If you'd been looking I might've been trying to get hold of it yet."

She examined the Colt's gun curiously.  She asked him how to handle it. He obligingly broke
it, emptied the cylinders and explained how it was fired.  But she was not equal to handling
the big thing, and told him so.

"Though if I should want to kill you now it would be easy, wouldn't it?" she reflected, after
he had reloaded the gun and laid it in her hand, the muzzle pointing toward himself and her
finger resting on the trigger.

"Not without cocking the gun."

"No, but I mean suppose I really should want to kill you----"

"I'll show you."  He cocked the revolver and placed it again in her hand and it lay once more
with her finger on the trigger.

"Now," he explained, "I'm covered."

"And to kill you all I have to do is to pull the trigger."

"Pulling the trigger, the way things are now, would certainly be a big start in that direction.
But"--the dry suspicion of a laugh crossed his eyes--"to point a gun at a man and pull the
trigger doesn't always kill him--not, anyways, in this country.  If it did, the population
would fall off pretty strong in some of these northern counties.  And you might be surprised
if I told you you couldn't pull the trigger right now, anyway."

"How do you know that?"

"Try it."

"But I might kill you!"

"That's the point."

"Nevertheless," she persisted, "I could if I wanted to."

"No matter how you put it, it's all the same--you can't want to."

"No, but suppose I were bound to keep you from doing something--like serving papers, for instance."

His legs were crossed under him and he was tossing bits of the gravel under his hand: "You'd
have a better show to do that if you went at it in another way."

"What way?"

"Well--by asking me not to serve them, for instance."

"Do you mean to say if I asked you not to serve papers you wouldn't do it?"  She eyed him with
simulated indignation.

He returned her gaze unafraid: "Try it," was his answer.

She took a deep breath.  Then she tossed her head: "I probably shouldn't care enough about
it for that.  Why don't you carry two revolvers?"

"Too much like baggage."

"Wouldn't it be a lot safer?"

He smiled: "If one gun refused to go off promptly, two wouldn't help a lot."

Her eyes and her thoughts returned to the gun in her hand.  For a moment she had forgotten
it.  Suppose her finger, while she was talking, had mechanically closed on the trigger.  She
blanched.  "Take it," she said, holding the gun out in both hands and looking away.

"Shall we let the dog go this time?" she heard him ask as he lowered the hammer.

CHAPTER VII

THE CLOSE OF THE DAY

They rode straight home.  On the way Dick went lame and both dismounted to examine him.  "This
will make you miss your train," she suggested, hypocritically.

He had Dick's foot up.  His comment on the remark was very like the rest of his comments. 
"Not this," he said--and without looking up.

"Do you mean to say you've missed it anyway?" asked Kate.

"What does the sun say?"

She bit her lip: "Too bad," she exclaimed, looking across the distance that still lay between
them and the Junction.

"I don't see anything wrong with his foot," he announced, completing his inspection.  "I think
he wrenched himself."

He said no more till they started again.  And then resumed in his odd way just where they had
left off talking: "I've been trying to figure out why you wanted me to miss the train."  She
looked at him in surprise.  "I think you did want me to," he continued.  "But I can't figure
out why."

She protested, but not with too many words.  She felt sure he was not easily to be deceived.
In any case, however, he was unflinchingly amiable.

After they got back to the Junction the totally unexpected happened. They dismounted and she
went into the lunch room.  Her victim pursued an examination of Dick's leg.  An early supper
was being served in the dining-room to a freight train crew.  Two of the Doubleday cowboys
from the ranch came into the lunch-room from the front door.  Kate, at the desk, was making
ready to manage her own escape from the scene.  The smaller cowboy, walking in last, looked
back curiously at her riding companion as he stood with Dick's hoof on his knee.  The man slouched
up to the counter: "Wouldn't that kill you?" muttered the smaller man to his partner.

"What do you mean?" demanded the other.

The first speaker hitched his thumb guardedly over his shoulder: "Know who that is out there?"

"No, I don't--who is he?"

Kate's ears were wide open: "None other," continued the man, pulling a face, "than the well-known
Jim Laramie himself."  His partner checked him and the two, talking in low tones, walked into
the dining-room.

Kate could not at first believe her ears; then she felt that the cowboy must know what he was
talking about.

Worst of all, Laramie, at that moment--before she could think of collecting herself--walked
in through the open door.  He came directly to the counter.  She hardly attempted to hide her
consternation: "Are you Jim Laramie?" she burst out in her excitement.

It must have been the manner of her words rather than the words themselves that startled him.
For just an instant the curtain lifted; a flash of anger shot from his eyes; it was drawn again
at once: "Is my reputation over here as bad as that?" he asked.

Kate was dumb.  Try as she would, she could not think of a thing to say; the recollection of
her reckless ride overwhelmed her.  "What's happened?" he continued with a little irritation.
"If you weren't afraid of me when you didn't know my name, why be afraid now?"

She stammered something, some apology, which he received, she afterward thought, coldly: "I'm
running up to the house now to change," she went on hurriedly, "but I must thank you for----"

What on earth was she to thank him for?  He helped her out: "Before you go," he interrupted,
sitting up on the counter stool nearest her and looking at her without paying the slightest
attention to her meaningless words, "before you go, tell me your name."

Oddly enough, by just speaking he restored order to her faculties.  She looked straight at
him: "You guessed that this morning," she said frankly.

"Kate?"

She nodded.

"That's queer," he mused.  "It must've been pure accident.  I heard that the man I came to
round up today had a girl named Kate, so I suppose that was the first name came into my head.
Kate, what else?"

"Suppose," she suggested gravely, "we keep the rest for the next time."

"For our next ride?"

She looked just away from his persistent eyes: "Perhaps."

"Will your name," he went on, "surprise me as much as my name surprised you?"

"Who knows?" she retorted, and speaking she started for the front door.

"Stop."  He stepped in front of her just enough to bar her way.  There was a tinge of command
in his voice and manner quite new.  Halted, but not pleased, she waited for him to go on: "You'll
come back, won't you?"

"I'll try to."

"I want to listen," he added coolly, "to the worst story you ever heard about Jim Laramie."

"I don't pay much attention to cowboy stories."

He certainly paid no attention to her words: "Will you come back?" he persisted.

"I will if I can," she said, confusedly.

He was just enough in front of her to detain her: "Say you will."

It was somewhat between command and entreaty.  Old Henry at the side of the platform was just
mounting the dun horse.  Kate was getting panicky: "Very well," she answered, "I'll come back."

The moment she got to the cottage she locked the front door and drew all the shades.  And every
mouthful of the cold supper she ate with her father lodged in her throat.  To him she dared
not say a word.  Once in the evening the door bell rang and some man asked for Barb Doubleday.
He made a few inquiries when Henry answered that Doubleday was not in town, but he did not
ask for Kate.  She felt curious tremors, listening to the low voice.  But Laramie--for it was
he--presently turned from the door and she heard his footsteps crunching down the gravel path
to the street.

In the morning Henry told her a man had lingered around the lunch room until the lights were
put out at ten o'clock.  By that time he must have known every pine knot in the varnished ceiling.
When peaceably put out of the room by the night man he had walked out on the platform to the
post where the horses had stood and looked long across the tracks toward Doubleday's cottage
on the hill.  No lights were burning in the cottage.  He turned to walk toward it.  But as
he stepped into the street the whistle of the eastbound Overland train sounded in the hills
to the west.  Evidently this changed his mind, for he retraced his steps and entered the waiting-room,
walked to the ticket window and bought a ticket for Sleepy Cat.  He waited until the train
pulled in and loitered on the platform till it was ready to pull out, speaking to no one. 
When the conductor finally gave the starting signal the man looked for the last time around
toward the lunch room door.  Everything was dark.

He caught the hand rail of the last open sleeper and swung up on the step.  There he stood
looking down the platform and across the street while the train drew slowly out.  Then turning
to go into the car he uttered only one word to himself--and that a mild one: "Gypped!"

But, even then, had Kate heard it she would have been frightened.

CHAPTER VIII

THE HOME OF LARAMIE

Almost due north of Sleepy Cat the Lodge Pole Mountains, tumbling over one another in an upheaval
southward, are flung suddenly to the west and spread in a declining ridge to the Superstition
range.  South of the Lodge Poles the country is very rough, but at the point where the range
is so sharply deflected there spreads fanlike to the east an open basin with good soil and
water.  It is known locally as the Falling Wall country, and, as the names of the region indicate,
it was once famous as a hunting ground, and so, as a fighting ground, for the powerful tribes
of early days.  And an ample Reservation in this basin--ending just where the good lands begin--is
the stamping ground of the last of the mountain red men.

But the struggle for possession of the Falling Wall country did not end with the red men. 
White men, too, have coveted the lands of the Falling Wall and fought for them.  Among the
blind the one-eyed are kings, and the Falling Wall basin lies amid inhospitable deserts, barren
hills and landscapes slashed to rags and ribbons by mountain storms--regions that have failed
to tempt even a white man's cupidity. The Indians fought for the basin with arrows, bullets,
tomahawks and scalping knives; the whites have fought chiefly in the land offices and courts,
but, exasperated by delays and inflamed by defeat, they have at times boiled over and appealed
to the rifle and the hip holster for decrees to quiet title.

It is for these reasons, and others, that the Falling Wall country has borne a hard and somewhat
sinister name, even in a region where men have been habitually indifferent to restraint and
tolerant of violent appeals to frontier justice.  In the very early days of the white man the
Indian clung to the Falling Wall country as his last stand; for the bad lands along the canyon
of the Falling Wall river made, as they yet make, an almost impenetrable fastness for sally
and retreat.

But even before the Indians were driven into their barren cage to the north, white adventurers
had penetrated the basin and it became, with the shifting of possession, a region for men of
hard repute.  Its traditions have been bad and few in the Falling Wall country have felt concern
over the fact.

Yet, from the earliest days, despite the many difficulties of living in the widely known but
not large park, a few hardy settlers managed from the beginning, in secluded portions of the
region, to keep their scalps and their horses and to live through Indian days and outlaw days--though
not often in peace, and never in quiet.

Among these early adventurers was one known as "Texas" Laramie, because he had the extraordinary
courage, or hardihood, to bring into the Falling Wall the first cattle ever driven into the
mountains from the Panhandle.  In a country where the sobriquet is usually the only name by
which it is courteous or safe to address a man, and where it is invariably apt, few men are
accorded two.  But Laramie had also been known as "Pump" Laramie because he brought into that
country the first Winchester rifle; and the instinctive significance the mind attaches to the
combination of cows and a repeating rifle was, in this instance, justified--there was between
the two a direct, even dynamic, connection.  Laramie thus figured prominently in the older
Falling Wall feuds.  It would have been difficult for him to figure obscurely, and do it more
than once.

Enemies said that he stole the bunch of cattle he first drove into the Falling Wall.  It was
not true but it made a good story.  And in any event, Texas Laramie defended his steers vigorously
against all men advancing claim to them between darkness and daylight--as enterprising neighbors
not infrequently undertook to do.  With the cattle, Laramie had brought into the mountains
a wife from Texas.  She was a young mother with a little boy, Jim; a good mother, never happy
in the country so far away from the Staked Plain--and not very long to live there.  But she
lived long enough to send Jim year after year to the Sisters' School on the Reservation.

To obtain for a boy any sort of an education in a region so wild and so inhospitable would
have seemed impossible.  Yet devoted Sisters--refined and aristocratic American women--were
already in this mountain country devoting their lives to the Indian Missions.  Under such women
little Jim learned his Catechism and his reading and from them and their example a few of the
amenities of life--so far removed from him in every other direction.  Under their care he grew
up, after he had lost his mother, among the Indian boys.  With these he learned to fish and
hunt, to trap for pocket money, to use a bow and arrow and a knife, to trail and stalk patiently,
to lie uncomplainingly in cold and wet, to ride without saddle or bridle or spur, to face a
grizzly without excitement, to use a rifle where the price of every cartridge was reckoned
and a poor aim sometimes cost life itself.

And every summer at home his father added extension courses in the saddle and bridle, spur,
hackamore and lariat to his education.  He taught him to rope, throw and mark, to use a coffee
pot and frying pan, and at last on the great day--the Commencement day, so to say of the boy's
frontier education--he presented him with his degree--a Colt's revolver and a box of cartridges--and
died.  As he lay on his deathbed, Texas Laramie left a parting advice to his young son: "You've
learned to shoot, Jim--you don't shoot bad for a youngster.  A man's got to shoot.  But the
less shooting you do, after you've learned--without you're forced to it, mind you--the more
comfortable you'll feel when you get where I am now.  All I can say is: I never killed an honest
man that I knowed of.  In fact," his breath came very slowly, "I never yet seen an honest man
in the Falling Wall to kill."

And Jim began life with the ranch, youth, a little bunch of cattle, no money and much health
in the Falling Wall.  His first year alone he never forgot, for in the spring he drove all
his steers--not a great many--into the new railroad town, south--Sleepy Cat--and sold them
for more money than he had ever seen at one time in his life.  He wandered from the bank into
Harry Tenison's gambling rooms--Harry having sold out his livery stable to Joe Kitchen shortly
before that--just to look on for a little while before starting home.  When Laramie did start
home, Tenison had all his steer money and Laramie owed the sober-faced gambler, besides, one
hundred dollars.  Laramie then went to work on the range for twenty-five dollars a month. 
He worked four months, and it was hard work, took his pay check in and handed it to Tenison.
That was strangely enough the beginning of a friendship that was never broken.  Tenison tried
to give the check back to Laramie.  He could not.  But Laramie never again tried to clean out
the bank at Tenison's.

The Laramie cabin on Turkey Creek--the son built afterward on the same spot--stood on a slight
conical rise some distance back from the little stream that watered the ranch.  From his windows
Jim Laramie could look on gently falling ground in all directions.  Toward the creek lay an
alfalfa field which, with a crude irrigating ditch and water from the creek, he had brought
to a prosperous stand.  Below the alfalfa stood the barn and the corral.

The day after Kate Doubleday's adventure with him at the Junction, Laramie was riding up the
creek to his cabin when a man standing at the corral gate hailed him.  It wag Ben Simeral.
Ben, old and ragged, met every man with a smile--a bearded, seamed and shabby smile, but an
honest smile.  Ben was a derelict of the range, a stray whose appeal could be only to patient
men.  Whenever he wandered into the Falling Wall country, where he had a claim, he made Laramie's
cabin a sort of headquarters and spent weeks at a time there, looking after the stock in return
for what John Lefever termed the "court'sies" of the ranch.

Laramie, greeting Ben, made casual inquiry about the stock.  Ben looked at him as if expectant;
but Ben was not aggressive for news or anything else.  He grinned as he looked Laramie over:
"Well, you're back again, Jim."

Laramie responded in kindly fashion: "Anybody been here?"

"Nary critter," declared the custodian, "'cept Abe Hawk--he came over to borry your Marlin rifle."

"What did he want with that?"

"Said he was going up into the mountains but he's comin' over again before he starts.  I knowed
he helped you track them wire scouts over to Barb's.  The blame critters tore off all the wire
t'other side the creek, too.  Get any track of 'em?" he asked, sympathetically alive to what
had been most on Laramie's mind when he had started from home.

Laramie barely hesitated but he looked squarely at Ben and answered in even tones: "No track, Ben."

Ben looked at him, still smiling with a kindly hope:

"Hear from the contest on the creek quarter?"

"They told me at Medicine Bend it had gone against me."

"Psho!  Never!  You've got another 'go' to Washington, hain't y'?"

Laramie nodded and got down from his horse.  Ben, removing the saddle, asked more questions--none
of them important--and after putting up the horse the two men started for the house.  Its rude
walls were well laid up in good logs on which rested a timbered roof, shingled.

A living-room with a fireplace roughly fashioned in stone made up the larger interior of the
cabin.  To the right of the fireplace a kitchen opened off the living-room and adjoining this,
to the right as one entered the front door, was a bedroom.  To the left stood a small table,
on which were scattered a few old books, a metal lamp and well-thumbed copies of old magazines.
Beside the table stood a heavy oak Morris chair of the kind sold by mail-order houses.  Two
other chairs, heavily built in oak, were disposed about the room, and on the left of the entrance--there
was but one door--stood a cot bed.  On the floor between the door and the fireplace lay a huge
silver tip bearskin, the head set up by an Indian taxidermist.  It was some time afterward
when Kate saw the cabin, but she remembered, even after it lay in ruins, just how the interior
had looked.

The four walls were really more furnished than the rest of the room. To the right and left
of the fireplace hung twin bighorn heads, and elk and stag antlers on the other walls supplied
racks for an ample variety of rifles, polished by familiar use and kept, through love of trusty
friends, in good order.  Trophies of the hunt, disposed sometimes in effective and sometimes
in mere man fashion, flanked the racks and showed the tastes of the owner of the isolated habitation;
for few trails led within miles of Laramie's ranch on the Turkey.

"Breakfast?"  Simeral looked at his companion, who stood vacantly musing at the door of the
kitchen.

"Coffee," answered Laramie, taking off his jacket, laying his Colt's on the table and slipping
off his breast harness.

"I got no bread," announced Ben, to forestall objection.  "Flour's low 'n' I didn't bake."

"Crackers will do."

"Ain't no crackers, neither," returned Ben, raising his voice and his smile in self-defense.

"Give me coffee and bacon," suggested Laramie, impatiently.

"'N' I'll fry some potatoes," muttered Ben, shuffling with a show of speed into the kitchen,
and calling inquiries back in his unsteady voice to the living-room, patiently digging at Laramie
for scraps of news from Sleepy Cat, volunteering, in return, scraps from the range and ranch.
Laramie sat down in the nearest chair, tilted it slightly back, and resting one arm on the
table gazed into the empty fireplace. He appeared as if much preoccupied--nor would, nor could,
he talk of what was in his mind, nor think of anything else.

Some minutes later he began in the same absent-minded manner on a huge plateful of bacon, with
a pot of coffee in keeping, and was eating in silence when the stillness of the sunshine was
broken by the sound of a horse's hoofs.  Laramie looked out and saw, through the open door,
a horseman riding in leisurely fashion up from the creek.

The man was tall.  He swung lightly out of his saddle near the door, and as he walked into
the house it could be seen that he was proportioned in his frame to his height; strength and
agility revealed themselves in every move.  A rifle slung in a scabbard hung beside the shoulder
of the horse, and the man's rig proclaimed the cowboy, though aside from a broad-brimmed Stetson
hat his garb was simplicity itself.

It was the way in which he carried his height and shoulders that arrested attention, nor was
his face one easily to be forgotten.  He wore a jet-black beard that grew close and dropped
compactly down.  It was neither bushy nor scraggly and with his black brows it made a striking
setting for strong and rather deep-set eyes which if not actually black were certainly very
dark.  His smile revealed white, regular teeth under his dark mustache, and his olive complexion,
though tanned, seemed different from those of men that rode the range with him--perhaps it
was owing to the glossy, black beard.

Abe Hawk was evidently at home in Laramie's cabin.  He stepped through the door and pushing
his hat back on his forehead took a chair and sat down.  The two men, masters of taciturnity,
looked at each other while this was taking place, and as Hawk seated himself Laramie called
for a cup and pushed the coffee pot toward his visitor.  Paying no attention to the unspoken
invitation, Hawk's features assumed the quizzical lines they sometimes wore when he relaxed
and poked questions at his friend.

"Well," he demanded, banteringly, "where's Jimmie been?"

"Medicine, Sleepy Cat--pretty near everywhere."

"I hear you got a job."

"I was offered one."

"Deputy marshal, eh?"

"Farrell Kennedy got me down to Medicine Bend to talk it over."

"What's the matter, couldn't you hold it?"

"I didn't want it."

"You're out of practise on this law-and-order stuff--you've lived up here too long among thieves,
Jim.  Find out who tore down your wire?"

Laramie replied in even tones but his voice was hard: "I trailed them across the Crazy Woman.
It was somebody from Doubleday's ranch."

"They had a story at Stormy Gorman's you'd gone over there to blow Barb's head off."

"Barb wasn't home."

Hawk was conscious of the evasion.  "Was Stormy's talk true?" he demanded curtly.

"I expected to ask Barb whether he wanted to put my wire back.  I was going to give him a chance."

"It wouldn't be hard to guess how that would come out.  Where was he?" asked Hawk, with evident
disappointment.

"They said he was in Sleepy Cat.  I rode in and missed him there.  He'd gone to the mines.
I took the train up to the Junction, There I accidentally got switched off my job and came home."

"How'd you get switched off?" asked Hawk, resenting the outcome.

Laramie's manner showed he disliked being bored into.  He leaned forward with a touch of asperity
and looked, straight at his visitor: "By not 'tending strictly to my own business, Abe."

Hawk knew from the expression of Laramie's eyes he must drop the subject, and though he lost
none of his bantering manner, he desisted: "They didn't have a warrant for me down at the marshal's
office, did they?"

"They were short of blanks," retorted Laramie coolly.

"How you fixed for flour?"

"Plenty of it."  Laramie spoke loudly for fear Simeral might protest. Then he called promptly
to the kitchen: "Ben, get up some flour for Abe."

Ben quavered a protest.

"Get it up now before you forget it," insisted Laramie.

"Is Tom Stone still foreman over at Doubleday's?"

"I guess he is," returned Laramie.

"What does Doubleday aim to do with Stone?" asked Hawk, cynically, "steal his own cattle from
himself?"

"A cattleman nowadays might as well steal his own cattle as to wait for somebody else to steal
'em."  Laramie spoke with some annoyance. "There's going to be trouble for these Falling Wall
rustlers."

"Meaning me?" asked Hawk, contemptuously.

"I never mean you without saying you, Abe--you ought to know that by this time.  But this running
off steers is getting too raw.  From the undertalk in Sleepy Cat there's going to be something
done."

"Who by?"

"By the cattlemen."

"I thought," Hawk spoke again contemptuously, "you meant by the sheriff."

"But I didn't," said Laramie.  "I meant by the bunch at the range.  And when they start they'll
stir things up over this way."

Hawk hazarded a guess on another subject: "It looks like Van Horn--putting in Stone over at
Doubleday's."

"It is Van Horn."

Hawk looked in silence out of the open door at the distant snow-capped mountains.  "Why don't
you kill him, Jim?" he asked after a moment, possibly in earnest, possibly in jest, for his
iron tone sometimes meant everything, sometimes nothing.

Laramie, at all events, took the words lightly.  He answered Hawk's question with another.
But his retort and manner were as easy as Hawk's question and expression were hard.  "Why don't
you?"

The bearded man across the table did not hesitate nor did he cast about for words.  On the
contrary, he replied with embarrassing promptness: "I will, sometime."

"A man that didn't know you, Abe, might think you meant it," commented Laramie, filling his
coffee cup.

Hawk's white teeth showed just for the instant that he smiled; then he talked of other things.

CHAPTER IX

AT THE BAR

The arrival of a baby at the home of Harry Tenison in Sleepy Cat had an immediate effect on
Kate Doubleday's fortune in the mountains--and, indeed, on the fortunes of a number of other
people in Sleepy Cat--wholly out of proportion to its importance as a family event.  It was
not, it is true, for the Tenisons a mere family event.  Married fifteen years, they had been
without children until the advent of this baby.  And the birth of a boy to Harry Tenison excited
not alone the parents, but the town, the railroad division and the hundred miles of range and
desert, north and south, tributary to the town.

For a number of years Tenison had run his place in Sleepy Cat undisturbed by the swiftly changing
fortunes of frontiersmen and railroad men. Tragedies, in their sudden sweep across the horizon
of his activities, the poised gambler and hotel man had met unmoved.  Men went to the heights
of mining or range affluence and to the depths of crude passion, inevitable despair and tragic
death, with Harry Tenison coldly unruffled. He was a man in so far detached from his surroundings,
yet with his finger on the pulse of happenings in his unstable world.  But the birth of one
baby--and that a small one--upset him completely and very unexpectedly shocked others of his
motley circle of acquaintance.

The complications followed on the announcement--on a Monday when the baby was three days old
and the mother and boy were reported by the nurse to be coming along like kittens--that the
following Saturday would be "open day" at the Mountain House--Tenison's new and almost palatial
hotel; with the proprietor standing host for the town and the countryside.

Before the week was out this word had swept through the mountains, from the stretches of the
Thief River on the South to the recesses of the Lodge Poles on the North.  It was the one topic
of interest for the week on the range.  Few were the remote corners where the news did not
penetrate and the unfortunates who missed the celebration long did penance in listening to
long-winded accounts of Sleepy Cat's memorable day.

It dawned in a splendor of blue sky and golden sun, with the mountain reaches, snow-swept and
still, brought incredibly near and clear through the sparkling air of the high plateau.  The
Sleepy Cat band were Tenison's very first guests for breakfast.

"'N' you want to eat hearty, boys," declared Ben Simeral, who had reached town the night before
in order that no round crossing the Tenison bar should escape him: "Harry expec's you to blow
like hell all day."

Few men are more conscientious in the discharge of duty than the members of a small-town brass
band.  The Sleepy Cat musicians held back only until the arrival of the early local freight,
Second Seventy-Seven, for their bass horn player, the fireman.  When the train pulled up toward
the station on a yard track, the band members in uniform on the platform awaited their melodic
back-stop, and the fireman, in greeting, pulled the whistle cord for a blast.  The switch engine
promptly responded and one whistle after another joined in until every engine in the yard was
blowing as Ben had declared Tenison expected the band itself to blow.

In this wholly impromptu and happy way the day was opened.  The band, laboriously trained for
years by the local jeweler--said to be able to blow a candle through an inch board with his
South Bend B flat cornet--now formed in marching order, the grimed fireman gamely in place
even after a night run, with his silver contrabass.  At an energetic signal from their leader
they struck up a march and started down street with the offering as a pledge of what they might
be expected to do.  They were not called on, however, to do all, for at noon the Bear Dance
Band arrived from the West and an hour later came the crack thirty-two-piece military band
from Medicine Bend, carrying more gold on their lacings and their horns than the local musicians
carried in the savings bank.

By the time the noon whistle blew at the roundhouse every trail and road into Sleepy Cat showed
dust--some of them an abundance.  The hotel was naturally the center of attraction, and Main
Street looked like a Frontier Day crowd.  The Reservation, too, sent a delegation for the occasion
and mingling in the jostling but good-natured crowd were chiefs, bucks and squaws, who, in
a riot of war bonnets, porcupine waistcoats, gay trappings and formal blankets, lent yellows
and reds and blues to the scene.  All entrances to the Mountain House were decorated and a
stream of visitors poured in and out, with congratulations for Tenison, who received them at
the bar in the big billiard hall opening on Main Street.

By evening the hall presented an extraordinary scene.  Every element that went to make up the
shifting life of the frontier could be picked from the crowd that filled the room.  Most numerous
and most aggressive in the spectacle, cattlemen and range riders in broad hats, leathern jackets
and mottled waistcoats, booted and spurred and rolling in their choppy steps on pointed heels,
moved everywhere--to and from the bar, around the pool tables and up and down the broad flight
of stairs leading to the second floor gambling rooms.  At the upper end of the long bar there
was less crowding than nearer the street door and at this upper end three men, somewhat apart
from others, while nominally drinking, stood in confab. First among them, Harry Van Horn was
noticeable.  His strong face, with its hunting nose, reflected his active mind, and as he spoke
or listened to one or the other of his companions--standing between them--his lively eyes flashed
in the overhead light.  On his left stood Tom Stone, foreman of the Doubleday ranch.  His head,
carried habitually forward, gave him the appearance of always looking out from under his eyebrows;
and the natural expression of his face, bordering on the morose, was never lighted by more
than a strained smile--a smile that suggested a grin, that puckered the corners of his eyes
and drew hard furrows down his cheeks, but evidenced nothing akin to even the skim-milk of
human kindness.

On Van Horn's left stood an older man of massive features, the owner of the largest ranch in
the north country, Barb Doubleday.

Miners from Thief River, with frank, fearless faces, broad-throated, belted and shifted, and
with brawny arms for pick and sledge and doublejack, moved to and from the bar like desert
travelers breathing in an oasis.  Men from the short spillway valleys of the Superstition Range--the
coyotes and wolves of the Spanish Sinks--were easily to be identified by their shifty eyes
and loud laughter and handy six-shooters. Moving in a little group rather apart from these
than mingling with them, talking and drinking more among themselves, were men from the Falling
Wall--men professedly "ranching" on the upper waters of the Horse, the Turkey and Crazy Woman
creeks, tributaries of the Falling Wall river--in point of fact, rustlers between whom and
the big cattlemen of the range there always existed a deadly enmity and at times open warfare.

At two card tables placed together in the upper inner corner of the room sat a little party
of these Falling Wall men smoking and drinking in leisurely, or, more correctly, in preliminary
fashion, for the evening was still young; and inspecting the moving crowd at the bar.  At the
head of the table sat the ex-cowboy and ex-pugilist, Stormy German, his face usually, and now,
reddened with liquor--square-shouldered, square-faced and squat; a man harsh-voiced and terse,
of iron endurance and with the stubbornness of a mule; next him sat Yankee Robinson, thin-faced
and wearing a weatherbeaten yellow beard.  And Dutch Henry was there--bony, nervous, eager-eyed,
with broken English stories of drought and hardship on the upper Turkey.  These three men--brains
and resource of several less able but not less unscrupulous companions who preyed on the cattle
range north of Sleepy Cat--led the talk and were the most carefully listened to by the men
that surrounded them.

It was later that two men entered the room from the hotel office together.  The contained,
defiant walk of the slightly heavier and taller of the two was characteristic, and without
the black beard, deep eyes and the pallor of his face, would almost have identified him as
Abe Hawk; while in the emotionless, sandy features of his companion and in his more frank,
careless make-up, the widely known ranchman of the Falling Wall, Jim Laramie, was easily recognized.

Hawk, separating from his companion, walked to the right.  German hailed him and Hawk paused
before the table at which the former prize fighter sat with his friends.  Each of these in
turn had something effusive to say to Hawk.  Hawk listened to everything without a change of
countenance--neither smile nor word moved him in the competition to arouse his interest.  When
all had had their fling of invitation and comment he refused an oft-repeated invitation to
sit down: "I might injure your reputations," he said grimly, and moved unconcernedly on.

Van Horn's eyes had not missed the inconspicuous entrance of the two Falling Wall men: "There's
the man himself, right now," he exclaimed, looking toward Laramie.

"No better time to talk to him, either, than right now," added Barb Doubleday hoarsely.  "Take
him back into the office, Harry.  When you're through come up to the room."

Van Horn, leaving the bar, intercepted Laramie.  Doubleday and Stone, pretending not to observe,
saw Van Horn, on the plea of important talk, succeed, after some demur, in inducing Laramie
to return with him to the hotel office.  Once there and in a quiet corner with two chairs,
Van Horn lost no time in opening his subject: "You know as well as I do, Jim, what shape things
are in on the North range.  It can't go on.  Everybody is losing cattle right and left to these
rustlers.  They've been running Doubleday's steers right down to the railroad camp on the Spider
Water--we traced the brands on 'em.  You know as well as I do who took 'em."

Laramie listened perfunctorily, his eyes moving part of the time over the room.  "Speak for
yourself.  Harry," he intervened at this juncture.  "I know exactly nothing about who took
anybody's steers, nor that any were taken."

Van Horn uttered a quick exclamation: "Well, you sure heard about it!"

"In this country a man can hear anything," observed Laramie, not greatly moved.  "I've heard
there isn't a crooked cattleman north of Sleepy Cat."

Van Horn stared.

"Go on," continued Laramie, looking at the passers-by, "I'm listening."

"Doubleday has sold the eating house and disposed of his property at the Junction----"

"You mean his creditors took it, don't you?"

"Put it any way you like.  He's going in for more cattle and we're going to put this range
on the map.  But--we've got to clean out this Falling Wall bunch first.  The big men can't
stand it any longer and won't stand it."

"What then?"

"I want you to get in right, on the move, with us, Jim--this is your chance.  You're in a tough
neighborhood over there.  Now I know you're not a rustler."

"No, you don't."

"Yes, I do," averred Van Horn.  "But everybody doesn't know you as well as I do.  And your
name suffers because you don't get along with the cattlemen--Doubleday, Pettigrew and the rest."

"What then?"

"What then?" echoed Van Horn, feeling the up-hill pull.  "Why, line up with us against these
rustlers.  We're going to have a big get-together barbecue this summer and when it's pulled
we want you there.  You'll have a friend in every man on the range--however some of 'em feel
now.  They know the stuff you're made of, Jim; they know if you put your hand to your gun with
them, you'll stay; and if you do it, they know it's good-by to the rustlers."

Closely as Van Horn, while speaking, watched the effect of his words, it was impossible to
gather from Laramie's face the slightest clue as to the impression they were making.  Laramie
sat quite relaxed, his back to the corner, his legs crossed, listening.  He looked straight
ahead without so much as blinking.  Van Horn, nervous and impatient, scrutinized him: "That's
my hand, Jim," he said flatly.  "What have you got?"

Laramie paused.  After a moment he turned his eyes on his questioner: "No hand.  This is not
my game."

"Make it your game and your game in this country is made.  Doubleday and Dan Pettigrew want
you.  They're the men that run this country--what do you say?"

"The men that run this country can't run me."

Van Horn, in spite of his assurance, felt the blow.  But he put on a front.  "What makes you
talk that way?" he flared.

"This is the same bunch," continued Laramie evenly, "that sent two different men to get me
two years ago--and when I defended myself--had me indicted.  That indictment is still hanging
for all I know.  This is the bunch that owns the district court."

Van Horn made a violent gesture.  "What's the use raking up old sores? That's past and gone.
That indictment's been quashed long ago."

"This is the bunch," and Laramie spoke even more deliberately; he looked directly, almost disconcertingly
at Van Horn himself, "that sent the men to rip off my wire just a while ago.  I tracked 'em
to Doubleday's and if I'd found Doubleday or you or Stone there that day--if I'd got my eyes
on Barb Doubleday that day--you'd 've turned the men that pulled that wire over to me or I'd
known the reason why.

"Now these same critters and you have the gall to talk to me about joining hands.  Hell, I'd
quicker join hands with a bunch of rattlesnakes.  When that crowd want me let them come and
get me.  I'm not chiding.  They talk about cattle thieves!  Why, your outfit would steal the
spurs off a rustler's heels.  And when men like Hawk and Yankee Robinson and German set up
a little ranch with a few head of cows for themselves your bunch blacklists them, refuses 'em
work anywhere on the range.  Where did Dutch Henry learn to steal?  Working for Barb Doubleday;
he branded mavericks for him, played dummy for his land entries, swore to false affidavits
for him.  Now when he turns around and steals the steers he stole for Barb, Barb has the nerve
to ask me to round him up at my proper risk and run him out of the country!"

Van Horn rose: "That's the answer, is it?"

Laramie sat still.  He looked dead ahead: "What did it sound like?" he asked, as Van Horn stood
looking at him.

"Just the same, Jim," muttered Van Horn, "the rustlers have got to go."

Laramie looked across the office: "That all may be," he observed, rising. And he repeated as
Van Horn started away: "That all may be.  And the men that ripped off my wire have got to put
it back.  Tell 'em I said so."

Van Horn whirled in a flash of anger: "You talk as if you think I'd ripped it off myself."

"I do think so."

For one instant the two men, confronting, eyed each other, Van Horn's face aflame.  Both carried
Colt's revolvers in hip holsters; Van Horn's gun slung at his right hip, Laramie's slung at
his left.  Both were known capable of extremes.  Then the critical moment passed.  Van Horn
broke into a laugh; without a yellow drop in his veins, as far as personal courage went, he
had thought twice before attempting to draw where no man had yet drawn successfully.  He put
out his hand in frank fashion: "Jim, you wrong yourself as much as me when you talk that way."

He made his peace as well as it could be made in words.  But when his protestations were ended
Laramie only said: "That all may be, Harry.  But whoever pulled my wire--and left it in the
creek--will put it back--if it's ten years from now."

The two men, Van Horn still talking, made their way back to the billiard hall--Laramie refusing
to drink, and halting for brief greetings when assailed by acquaintances.  After they parted,
Van Horn, as soon as he could escape notice, passed again through the door leading to the hotel
office.  He walked up the main stairway to the second floor, thence to the third floor and
following a corridor stopped in front of the last room, slipped a pass key into the lock and,
opening the door, entered and closed it behind him.

Two men sat in the room, Doubleday and Stone.  Stone was just out of the barber's chair, his
hair parted and faultlessly plastered on both sides across his forehead, and his face shaven
and powdered.  His forehead drawn in horizontal wrinkles rather than vertical ones, looked
lower and flatter because of them.  To add to the truculence of his natural expression, he
was now somewhat under the influence of liquor and looked perplexed.

Van Horn did not wait to be questioned; he walked directly to the table between the two men
and took a cigar from the open box: "Can't do a thing with that fellow," he reported brusquely.

Doubleday, by means of questions, got the story of the fruitless interview.  Stone listened.
The slow movement of his eyes showed an effort but none of the story escaped him.

Van Horn, answering with some impatience, had lighted one cigar, and bunching half a dozen
more in his hand stowed them in an upper waistcoat pocket.  Doubleday, between heavy jaws and
large teeth, shifted slowly or chewed savagely at a half-burned cigar and bored into Van Horn.
Van Horn was in no mood for speculative comment: "You might as well talk to a wildcat," he
said.  "Pulling that wire has left him sore all over."

Doubleday looked at Stone vindictively: "That was your scheme."

"No more than it was Van Horn's," retorted Stone.

"What's the use squabbling over that now?" demanded Van Horn impatiently. "I'm done, Barb.
You've got to go ahead without him."

Doubleday chewed his cigar in silence.  Van Horn, restless and humiliated, spoke angrily and
thought fast.  From time to time he looked quickly at Stone--the foreman was in condition to
do anything.

"Look here, Tom," exclaimed Van Horn in low tones, "suppose you go downstairs and give him
a talk yourself.  What do you say, Barb?"  He shot the words at Doubleday like bullets.  Doubleday
understood and his teeth clicked sharply.  He said nothing---only stared at the foreman with
his stony gray eyes.  Stone drew his revolver from his hip and, breaking the gun, slipped out
the cartridges and slipped the five mechanically back into place.

Laramie in the meantime had joined a group of men at the upper end of the bar in the billiard
hall--McAlpin, Joe Kitchen's barn boss; Henry Sawdy, the big sporty stock buyer of the town,
and the profane but always dependable druggist and railroad surgeon, Doctor Carpy.  With one
of these, Sawdy, Harry Tenison from behind the bar was talking.  He interrupted himself to
hold his hand over toward Laramie: "Been looking for you, scout," he said, in balanced tones.
"Been looking for you," he repeated, releasing Laramie's hand and holding up his own.  "If
you'd failed me today, Jim----"

"I wouldn't fail you, Harry."

"It's well you didn't--champagne, Luke," he added, calling to a solemn-faced bartender who
wore a forehead shade.

"No champagne for me, Harry," protested Laramie.

"What are you going to have?" asked the mild-voiced bartender, perfunctorily.

Laramie tilted his hat brim: "Why," he answered, after everybody had contributed advice, "if
I've got to take something on this little boy, a little whisky, I suppose, Luke."

"No poison served here tonight, Jim," growled Sawdy, throwing his bloodshot eyes on Laramie.

"I don't want any, anyway, Henry," was the unmoved retort.

Luke, wrapping the cork of the champagne bottle under his long fingers, hesitated.  Tenison,
looking with his heavily-lidded eyes, did not waver: "You'll drink what I tell you tonight,"
he maintained coldly.  "Open it, Luke."

Laramie stood sidewise while talking, one foot on the rail, his elbow resting on the bar, and
with his head turned he was looking back at Tenison, who stood directly opposite him behind
the bar.  Laramie submitted to the dictation without further protest: "A man will try anything
once," was his only comment.

As he uttered the words he felt a point pressed tightly against his right side and what was
of greater import, heard the familiar click of a gun hammer.

It was too late to look around; too late to make the slightest move.  All that Laramie could
get out of the situation, without moving, he read, motionless, in Tenison's eyes, for Tenison
was now looking straight at the assailant and with a frozen expression that told Laramie of
his peril.  The next instant Laramie heard rough words:

"Turn around here, Jim."

They told him all he needed to know, for in them he recognized the voice. In the instant between
hearing the words and obeying, a singular change took place in the Falling Wall ranchman's
eyes.  Looking over at Tenison his eyes had been keen and clear.  Slowly and with a faint smile
he turned his head.  When his eyes met those of Tom Stone, who confronted him pressing the
muzzle of a cocked Colt's forty-five gun against his stomach, they were soft and glazed.  Laramie
had changed in an instant from a man that had not tasted liquor to a man half tipsy.

It was a feint, but a feint made with an accurate understanding of a dangerous enemy.

CHAPTER X

LARAMIE COUNTS FIVE

There was not a chance of escape.  Laramie's left arm was resting on the bar.  Under the overhang,
Stone, as he faced Laramie, now pressed the gun with his right arm, into Laramie's stomach.
For Laramie to attempt to knock it away with his own right hand would be to take an almost
certainly fatal chance; while for any friend of his to touch Stone or shoot him would mean
certain death to Laramie.  Feeling that he had his enemy dead to rights, Stone baited him:

"Laramie," he began, fixing his eyes on those of his victim, "there's some men's lived in this
country too long."

The words carried the irritable nasal tone familiar to Stone's acquaintances.  Laramie's eyes
merely brightened a little with the effort to reply: "Tom," he declared, with just enough of
hesitation to play the game, "that's the first thing my wife said yes'day morning."

Stone stared: "When," he demanded, "did you get married?"

"Put up your gun.  I'll tell you about it."

Stone only grinned: "I can hear pretty well, right now."

"If you want to see her picture, Tom, uncock your gun."

"Not a little bit.  I've got you right."

Laramie smiled: "Sure, Tom, but there's plenty of time; put down the hammer."  Stone, without
moving his gun, did silently lower the hammer. Laramie counted one.  Then he began to describe
his trick bride.  Stone cut him off.  He cocked his gun again: "Show me her picture," he snarled.

Tenison took the instant to lean impressively across the bar.  He pointed a long finger at
Stone: "Tom," he said, with measured emphasis, "no man can pull a gun here tonight and get
away with it.  That'll be enough."

Stone scowled: "Harry, this scout is through; nobody wants him any longer in this country,"
he said.

"Take your quarrel somewhere else tonight--this is my celebration--do you get me, Tom?"

Under the implied threat of the determined gambler the hammer of Stone's gun came down: "I
c'n get along with any man that'll do what's right," asserted Stone, trying to keep his head
clear.  "Laramie won't."

"Why, Tom!" expostulated Laramie, reproachfully.

The revolver clicked; the hammer was up again.

"Y' won't do what's right, will y', Laramie?" demanded Stone thickly.

There were probably fifty men in the room.  As if by instinct each of them already knew on
what a slender thread one man's life hung.  Hawk, the quickest and surest of Laramie's friends,
stood ten paces away, up the bar, but the silence was such that he could hear every deliberate
word.  Glasses, half-emptied, had been set noiselessly down, discussions had ceased, every
eye was centered on two men and every ear strained.  A few spectators tiptoed out into the
office.  Others that tried to pass through the swinging front-door screen into the street found
a crowd already peering intently in through the open baize.

"Tom," resumed Laramie, in measured seriousness, "it's not you 'n' me can't get on--it's men
here has made trouble 'tween you and me, Tom. You 'n' me rode this range when we didn't have
but one blanket atween us--didn't we, Tom?" he demanded in loud tones.

Stone, in drunken irresolution, uncocked his gun but held it steady. "That's all right, Laramie,"
he growled.

"Did we quarrel then?" demanded Laramie, boisterously.  "I'm asking you, Tom, did you 'n' me
quarrel then?"

"When a man can't turn in with Harry Van Horn an' Barb Doubleday," grumbled Stone, "it's time
for him to quit this country."  His revolver clicked again; the hammer went up.

Laramie regarded him with sobering amazement: "Who told you I wouldn't turn in with Barb Doubleday?"
he exclaimed loudly.  "Who told you that?"

"Harry Van Horn told me."

Tenison tried to interpose.  "You shut up, Tenison," was the answering growl from Stone.  But
Tenison stuck to it till the hammer came down. It was only for a moment--the next instant a
score of breathless men heard the click of the gun as it was cocked again.

"Why," demanded Laramie, more cool-headed than his friends, drawn-faced and tense about him,
cooler far than his maudlin words implied, and still fighting for a forlorn chance, "why didn't
Harry Van Horn tell me to turn in with a friend--why didn't he tell me to turn in with you,
Tom Stone--with a man I rode and bunked with?  Why did they make you their scapegoat, Tom?
You've got me all right; I know that.  But what about you?  You can't get ten feet.  Abe Hawk's
right back of you, waitin' for you now.  They'd dump us into the same hole, Tom.  You don't
want to go into the same hole with me, do you?  Let's talk it over."

The rambling plea sounded so reasonable it won a brief reprieve from Stone.

"Don't uncock your gun till I'm through, Tom," urged Laramie.  "I don't want to take any advantage
at all of an old pardner.  Keep it cocked but listen.

"I don't want to talk with Van Horn," Laramie went on, "not even with Barb Doubleday, fine
a man as he might be--I ain't 'a' sayin', Tom. But I don't want to talk to him.  I want to
talk to you.  Just you and me, Tom--talkin' it over together.  Don't be goat for nobody, Tom.
What?"

The drunken foreman's brow contracted in irresolute perplexity: "What do you say?" urged Laramie.
Vacillating, Stone let down the hammer to talk it over.  It went up again almost instantly.
There may in that last brief instant have flashed across his muddled consciousness a realization
of his fatal mistake; perhaps he saw in the wicked flash of Laramie's glazed eyes a warning
of blunder.

Knowing that mountain men carry only five cartridges in their revolvers, leaving the hammer
for safety on an empty chamber, Laramie had parleyed with Stone only long enough to suit his
own purpose.  His right arm shot out at Stone's jaw.  As his fist reached it, the gun against
his stomach snapped viciously.  But the hammer, already raised six times, came down on the
sixth and empty chamber.  It was the chance Laramie had played for.  Stone sank like an ox.
As he went down his head struck the foot-rail.  He lay stunned.

Men drew long breaths.  McAlpin, stooping in a flash, wrenched Stone's revolver from his hand
and with a grin, laid it on the bar.  Laramie, watching Stone coldly, did not move.  His left
foot still rested on the rail, his left arm on the bar.  But without taking his eyes off the
prostrate man he in some way saw the white-faced bartender peering over in amazement at the
fallen foreman:

"It seems to take you a good while, Luke," protested Laramie, mildly, "to open that bottle."

CHAPTER XI

A DUEL WITH KATE

When the eating-house at the Junction was closed, Harry Tenison sent for Belle and offered
her the position of housekeeper at the Mountain House.  This Belle declined.  She had long
had in her head the idea of taking a place and serving meals on her own hook, as she expressed
it. Her instinct for independence, always strong, had not only prevented her getting married
but made her restive under orders.  She was stubborn--her enemies called her abusive names
and her best friends admitted that she was sometimes difficult.  At Sleepy Cat she took a cottage
in lower Main Street.  She had some furniture, and having a little money saved and a little
borrowed from McAlpin, Belle bought a few new pieces, including a folding bed secured at a
bargain, and opened her doors for business.  And whatever her faults of temperament, Belle
could cook.

Kitchen's barn was headquarters for the small ranchers from the north and for the Falling Wall
men, and McAlpin soon had a trade seeking Belle's place.  The cottage itself faced the side
street, but a little shop annex opened on Main.  In this and in the cottage dining-room Belle
served her meals.  Very soon, however, she made trouble for McAlpin.  It developed that she
would not serve anybody she did not like and as her fancy was capricious she gave most of McAlpin's
following the cold shoulder.  He spent much time in the beginning, hot-footing it, as Belle
termed it, between the barn and the cottage trying to straighten things out.  In the end he
gave over and told Belle she could starve if she wanted to.  Whereupon she said tartly that
she did want to; and McAlpin snatching off his baseball cap, as he did when greatly moved,
and twirling it in his hand asked for his money--which he failed to get.

Yet one man among the hardy friends of the barn boss did find favor at the cottage and he the
last whom McAlpin would have picked for a likely favorite.  This was Jim Laramie.  Laramie
soon became a regular customer of Belle's and his friends naturally followed him.

The closing out of her father's interests at the Junction was without regret for Kate, since
it sent her up to where she wanted to be--at the ranch.  For some time after establishing herself
there she rarely came into Sleepy Cat.  Then as the novelty wore off and small wants made themselves
felt, she rode oftener to town--mail and shopping and marketing soon established for her a
regular round and when she did ride to Sleepy Cat she nearly always saw Belle; sometimes she
lunched with her.  Belle was a stickler in her home for neatness, even though the cyclone might
have been supposed to harden her to dust.

More than this, Belle knew what was going on--she had the news. Little, in the daily round
of the town and its wide territory, got by the modest scrim curtains of Belle's place; she
became Kate's reporter. Men would say this was the principal attraction for Kate, and that
the cooking came second--not so.  The real reason Belle got the gossip of the country was because
her customers were men.  Kate was probably the only woman, certainly almost the only one, among
her patrons.  Belle explained this by saying that none of the rest of the ranchwomen would
spend their money for lunch.  The truth really was that Belle did not like women, anyway--Kate
she tolerated because she did like her.

It was the day after Tenison's big celebration that Kate rode into town for the mail, and after
some shopping walked down to Belle's for lunch. Belle was at the butcher shop across the street,
telephoning.  She came in after a moment.

"It seems to me you spend a good deal of time with that butcher," said Kate, significantly.

"Oh, no, he's got a club foot.  Has Harry Van Horn been shining up to you?"

Kate was taken aback, but she had been to blame for giving Belle an opening and could only
enter a confused denial.

"The first serious symptom," said Belle, garrulously, "will be, he'll have a headache; he'll
ask for cold cloths on his forehead.  When that works pretty well he'll tell you your hair
is like his sister's and some evening he'll ask you to take it down.  He asked me one night
to take mine down.  I handed him my wig.  Say! he was the most surprised man in Sleepy Cat.
I've been trying for an hour to get that rascally milkman on the telephone--there's not a drop
of cream in the house. Well, how are you?  Was Tom Stone home when you left?"

One question followed another.  Kate had not only not seen the ranch foreman--she had not heard
of the excitement of the night before.  From Belle she got the details of Stone's attempt to
kill Laramie.  The story lost nothing in Belle's hands.  She had heard all versions and was
pretty good at story telling herself.

"After McAlpin picked up Stone's gun Laramie told him to turn it over to Luke; and he told
Luke not to give it back to Stone till this morning--I guess they hid Stone last night."  She
wound up with an abusive fling at Doubleday's foreman.  "What do you keep such a beastly critter
around for?" she asked, looking at Kate hard for an answer.

Humiliated at the recital, Kate thought it time to say something herself: "Why do you ask me
a question like that?"'

Belle arched her eyebrows belligerently.  "Why shouldn't I?" she demanded.  And bridling with
further criticism of Stone and by implication of those that employed him, she let fly again.

Kate tried to ignore her outburst: "You know perfectly well," she said firmly, "I have nothing
to say about the ranch or how it is run, or who runs it.  And I don't care to listen to any
comments on that subject."

"If you don't like my comments you needn't come here to listen to them," retorted Belle, flaming.

The two were standing at the cook stove.

"While I am here," returned Kate with tart dignity, "please don't abuse me."

"I say what I please to anybody if it's right," exclaimed Belle rudely.

"You'll be ashamed of yourself when you cool off," Kate returned, pointing to the broiler:
"You don't expect me to eat all that meat, do you?"

Belle answered with an offended dignity of her own: "I expect Jim Laramie to eat the biggest
part of it.  And there he comes now!"

The front door opened, in fact, while she was speaking; Kate stood with her back to it and
though by turning she could have peeped through the curtained archway, she would not have looked
for a million dollars.  If Belle wanted her revenge she had it at that moment.  Kate could
not sink through the floor to escape, but how she wanted to!  She did step quickly aside hoping
she had not been seen, and retired to the farthest corner of the kitchen.  Belle's mouth, before
the stove, set grimly and with her left hand she gave her wig the vicious punch she used when
wrought up.  Kate motioned to her frantically.  Belle regarded her coldly but did come closer
and Kate caught at her sleeve: "For heaven's sake," she begged in a whisper, "don't let him
know I'm here."

Kate eyed her anxiously.  Belle's face was hard, and quick, firm steps were coming from the
front door.

"Hello, Belle!" was the greeting.  Had they been Kate's death message the words could not have
frightened her more.  She knew, too well, the voice.

"You didn't get my message," were the next words flung through the archway.

"I got it," answered Belle, going forward and providentially stopping Laramie before he reached
the curtains.

"Sit down right there," she added, pointing to a table at the rear of the lunch room.  "I hurried
all I could but that rascally milkman hasn't been here yet and there's no cream for your coffee.
Your dinner's most ready though."

She started back to the kitchen.

"Not enough for two, is there?" asked Laramie.

"Who's coming?" demanded Belle, stopping in her tracks.

"Belle, you're suspicious as a cattleman.  Nobody's coming, but I'm hungry."

While he continued his banter she served him and attempted to serve Kate behind the curtains.
By persistent, almost despairing pantomime, Kate dissuaded her from this.  But at that moment
the front door opened again, a brisk greeting was called out and a heavy tread crossed the
uneven floor of the outer room.

"John Lefever!"  Laramie got up to welcome the big deputy marshal. "Just in time.  Take off
your manners and sit down."

A bubbling laugh greeted the sally: "Jim, I just can't do it."

"Oh, yes, you'll eat with me.  Where you from?"

"Bear Dance; and Medicine Bend on the next train.  Heard you were in town and dropped off for
just one hour.  Say, this is more like life's fitful fever to set eyes on you.  Heard you were
threatened last night with appendicitis.  How about it?" and John bubbled over again.  In the
next breath he greeted Belle as gaily.  Laramie asked for another plate and Lefever promptly
resumed: "You look kind of down in the mouth, Jim. What's the matter with you?"

"Nothing's the matter with me."

Lefever shrugged his shoulders: "You're a kind of low-spirited Indian, anyway.  What you doing
up in the Falling Wall?"

"Nothing."

"Always nothing," repeated Lefever.

"Better come up," suggested Laramie.  "What are you doing?"

Lefever's eyes expanded with cheer, but his voice choked with emotion: "Doing?  Rusting!"

"That doesn't sound much like 'life's fitful fever.'"

John glared at his companion: "Life's fitful fever!  Why, this is only a passing flash!  How
about it when you can't raise even a normal temperature?  Fever?  I haven't felt so much as
a gentle perspiration for months!  The rust is eating into my finger tips," he declared with
violence.  "I'm a fat man.  A fat man must have action,"--his voice fell--"else he gets fatter.
I've got to do something.  Once or twice I've come pretty near having to go to work."

Laramie's expression may have been skeptical; at all events John pointed a corroborating finger
at him: "You don't believe it!  Just the same," he added, moodily, "it's straight."

"What's de Spain doing, John?"

The tone of the answer bordered on the morose: "Running a nursery at Medicine Bend."

"Trees?"

"Trees!" John snortingly invoked the hottest place he could think of. "Trees?  Babies!  Jim,"
he exclaimed, "I'm no family man--are you?"

"You like Medicine Bend, don't you?"

"Too many people there."  John settled gloomily back.  Then with wide-open eyes he started
suddenly forward: "Give me a gun, Jim," he said wildly, "a gun and a horse."

"And a north wind!" exclaimed Laramie.

"And a high country," cried Lefever with flashing eyes, "a country where you can't see a damned
thing in any direction for a hundred and fifty miles!"

Though talking vigorously he was eating, without protest from Laramie, everything in sight.
Kate could not help listening; Lefever's high spirits were contagious.

"Jim," came next between mouthfuls.  "What was that story about you being up at the Junction
the day I wanted you to serve those papers on old Barb Doubleday?"

"I went up there that day because I had business of a different kind with Barb."

"About the wire ripping, yes.  But I heard you got sewed up by a skirt and didn't talk wire
to Barb at all."

"No more of that, John."

"What was there to it?"

"I guess there was."

"A ride or something--what?"

"Something, John."

"Thunder!  It must have been the ride.  I had a deputy marshalship all lined up for you if
that hadn't happened.  And believe me, boy, a deputy marshalship isn't lying around loose every
day!"

Kate listened keenly for Laramie's comment:

"The ride was worth the price, John," was all he said.

"Some skirt, eh?"

Laramie squirmed and with an expletive protested:

"Hang it, John----"

"No matter, no matter.  I'll get it all from Belle some day.  And after you get through with
your wire thieves we'll tell the story of your brief romance----"

"Over my grave."

"Right, Jim--over your grave."

"John," Laramie ran on, "do you remember that song Tommie Meggeson used to sing on the round-up--a
pretty little thing.  It had one good line in it: 'Death comes but once, and then, sometimes--too
late.'"

Belle appeared with a vegetable: "It won't keep you waiting an awful while if things go on
the way they're going now," she put in grimly.

"That was a good song," mused Laramie, "a good old song."  But he heard a slight sound in the
kitchen and his eyes were turned toward the archway.

"Just the same that song won't keep you from getting killed," persisted Belle.

"Even that would beat appendicitis clean to death, Belle," maintained Laramie, still listening.

"You've got lots of time," he added, as Lefever looked at his watch.

"I haven't," exclaimed his companion.  "I've got to send a message. Come over to the train."

"I've got to write a couple of letters."

"Come over to the station and write your letters."

Laramie shook his head: "I couldn't even get to the station by one o'clock.  Every man in Main
Street wants to talk about Tom Stone. You'd think I had a million friends among the cattlemen
this morning."

"I heard old Barb Doubleday is grinning like a hangman today."

"If Belle's got some ink I'll write my letters right here."

Kate's spirits, which had risen at the hope of being so luckily rid of one who might prove
troublesome, fell at his refusal to leave.  John urged, but Laramie only asked Belle again
for the ink.  Lefever tried to coax Belle to go to the train with him.  Belle would do almost
any fool thing--as John bluntly averred--but this time she must have had pity on Kate and would
not leave her unprotected.  Lefever went his way.  From a shelf near where Kate, with clasped
hands, sat in silence Belle took paper and ink in to Laramie and began to clear the table.

At this unlucky moment the front door was opened swiftly and a boy from the butcher shop stuck
his head inside.

"Miss Shockley," he called, "the milkman is on the 'phone now, if you want him."  Closing the
door he ran back across the street.  With a sense of her wrongs keen upon her, Belle, forgetting
her charge in the kitchen, hurried after him.

Even then, Kate hoped that by keeping deathly still she might escape an unpleasant meeting.
She never breathed more carefully in her life, yet she was doomed.  She heard Laramie's chair
pushed back and heard his footsteps.  She could not be sure which way he was walking, but she
thought only of flight.  As stealthily and rapidly as possible, she started for the back door.
Without looking around she felt as if he had come to the archway and was looking at her.  With
courage and resolve, she grasped the knob to open the door.  It was locked.  She fumbled with
the key.  Behind her, silence.  She locked and unlocked the door more than once, and with a
fast-dying hope, for the wretched door would not open.  Flushed with annoyance, she turned
around only to see Laramie standing precisely where she had imagined him.

They faced each other.  Kate could not have found a word to say had her life depended on it.
Laramie held in his left hand an ink bottle, in his right a pen.  He, too, seemed surprised
but he recovered himself: "You are certainly unlucky with doors," he said.  "If you'll tell
me where Belle keeps her ink, I'll tell you how to open that," he added calmly.

Kate stiffened and shrugged her shoulders the least bit: "I haven't any idea where Belle keeps
the ink," she replied, clearing her throat of its huskiness.

He pointed to beyond where she stood: "I think the ink supply is on that shelf; she gave me
an empty bottle.  Should you mind handing me one with ink in it?"

Kate turned to the shelf: "There seem to be two kinds here," she said as coldly as possible.

"Any bottle with a hole in the top will do," he suggested.  "This one," he held the bottle
up in his hand and looked at it, "seems to have a hole top and bottom.  Give me the blue ink,
will you?"

"I am sure I don't know which is which.  Perhaps you had better help yourself," Kate said icily.

"Thank you.  But I'll show you how to open the door first."

"Don't trouble yourself."

"No trouble at all."  He walked to the door, explaining as he took hold of the knob: "The door
wasn't locked, but the catch held the latch.  I could tell that from the way you handled it.
You locked it, yourself----"

Kate could not hide her resentment: "It wouldn't open when I first took hold of it," she declared
hastily.  "I tried it before I touched the key."

"That's what I'm explaining.  When you did take hold of the key you locked the door with the
dead bolt and then you couldn't open it; so you unlocked it and tried it again.  After that
you worked so fast I lost track."  He pointed to the back of the rim lock: "The catch was on."
And pushing down the catch, he turned the knob and opened the door.

Kate was thoroughly incensed: "You are doubtless better acquainted here than I am."

"To tell the truth, I have to be acquainted with rooms I go into.  If I ever tried to get through
a door and failed, it might not be pleasant for me.  And there's a board fence, six feet high,
all around this yard, so unless you're a good climber you couldn't have got out anyway."

Kate felt she looked very silly, standing staring at him, and perhaps looking frightened--as
she really was---for he went on as if he were explaining to a child: "I'm not permitted to
tell you, but I'm going to----"

"Don't bother, please----"

"Yes, I'd rather: There is a way to get out without climbing the fence; a loose board I'll
show you sometime--but you must handle yourself fast to make your get-away."

"I never expect," she said contemptuously, "to have to make a get-away."

"Then I was wrong," he returned frankly, "for I kind of thought you were trying to make one
a minute ago."

His composure irritated Kate:  "You are very much mistaken," she declared with spirit in her
words, for she saw--indeed knew--how persistent he was.  "I was only trying to leave for home
quietly and quickly."

His eyes were a study in silent laughter: "That's all I've ever claimed to be doing, any time
in my life."

"But I can just as well leave by the front door--which, perhaps," retorted Kate, "you haven't
always been able to do."

"Before you go"--he was standing directly in the archway, so she had to listen--"tell me about
things at the Junction; I hear the lunch room was closed up a while ago."

"It was.  But"--Kate thought the time for explanation had come--"I was not working at the eating-house
when you came in there.  I am Kate Doubleday and I wanted to save my father that day and I'm
not a bit sorry for it."

"I suppose, then, I ought to speak out, too.  I was sure you were Kate Doubleday soon after
I got into the lunch-room that day and I'm not a bit sorry for it.  And I knew pretty soon
you were trying to save your father.  And I helped you."

"Oh--"  Kate suppressed an incredulous exclamation.

"Believe it or not as you like, I helped you.  And I'm not a bit sorry for it.  Though he is
no friend of mine, you have been, from that day on; and if you ever give me a chance I'll prove
it.  The worst thing you did was to go back on your word----"

"My word was not freely given," Kate was speaking furiously.

"It shouldn't have been given at all, then.  But it's all right.  Will you be friends with me?"

"No man that speaks of my father as you spoke of him a moment ago can be my friend."

"It was Lefever spoke of your father.  I couldn't shut him off.  Of course he didn't know you
were here.  I did know after I'd been here awhile.  I heard you whisper.  That's why I asked
for the ink--I had no letters to write.  There's a lot of hard feeling in this country right
now.  Every man in it has his friends and enemies.  You mustn't take it seriously when you
hear hard words--I don't; and I hear plenty.  Hadn't you and I better be friends to begin with,
anyway?"

"No," she exclaimed angrily.  "Please let me pass."

He stepped promptly aside: "I never dreamed of doing anything less."

Kate started rapidly for the front door.  Whom should she run into just as she opened it but
Belle coming back from her wretched telephoning and with a bottle of cream!  Kate inwardly
blamed her for all her trouble, and she was on edge, besides: "Where you going?" demanded Belle.

"Home," answered Kate, shortly.

"Home?  You haven't had your lunch."

"I don't want any."

Belle caught Kate's arm: "Now you just hold on.  What's the matter?  Is it Laramie?"  Belle
must have read her face for she answered nothing, only tried to get away.  "But, child!" she
exclaimed.  "Where's your coat--wait till I bring it--and your gloves!"  Kate paused at the
door. In a minute Belle came running back: "He's gone, absolutely.  There isn't a soul anywhere
about.  Now you shan't go till you take a cup of coffee.  Here's the cream--he left it at the
wrong door, the stupid!"

Kate could not get away.  And Belle had told the truth: Laramie was gone.

CHAPTER XII

THE BARBECUE

Whatever the shortcomings of the American frontier code there never was a time in its history
when a man could violate the principles of fair play and keep public opinion on his side. 
In this instance, Stone's conduct reacted unfavorably on the cattlemen.  The townspeople that
made money out of the trade of the big ranches always stood up for the cattlemen, but they
were put most unpleasantly on the defensive by the incident.  Even had Stone's attempt on Laramie's
life succeeded it would have been easier, for the partisans, to handle than the failure it
proved.  As a fait accompli it would have been regretted, but forgotten; as a failure it settled
nothing.

Among the few townspeople that sturdily retained independence of opinion on all matters, none
stood higher than the surgeon, Doctor Carpy.  And encountering Doubleday in the street shortly
after the Stone incident, he took it on himself to talk to him.

The doctor had his office at his home, but back of the prescription case in his little drug
store--no bigger than a minute--he had a small room for emergency consultations.  To this he
invited Doubleday, and, having ushered him in, seated him and closed the door, Carpy sat down:
"There's few men, Barb, in this country," the doctor began, "that dare talk to you the way
you ought to be talked to; of them few, I'm probably the only one that would take the trouble.
Your enemies won't talk and everybody friendly with you is afraid of you.  You've got so much
property and stuff here they're plumb afraid of you.  I'm a poor man, Barb--don't never expect
to be anything else, and I don't give a hang for anybody," averred the erratic surgeon, "and
nobody gives a hang for me."

Doubleday, chewing the stub of a cigar, eyed his medical adviser with an unsympathetic stare,
but this in no way disturbed the self-appointed critic.  "For a long time now, Barb," he continued,
"you've been in the nastiest kind of a fight on Jim Laramie.  You've tried to run him off the
range and you tried to beat him out of his land and you've tried to break him.  He's got the
best land in the Falling Wall and he's in your way.  One time his wire is all pulled off his
fence.  Another time your foreman pokes a gun into his stomach."

Doubleday flared up: "Am I the only man that Laramie's got differences with?  When his fence
is tore down, am I to blame?  Am I to blame for every drink Tom Stone takes?  What are you
talking about?" demanded Doubleday with violence.

The doctor could not have been calmer had he been reaching at the critical moment of an operation
for Doubleday's appendix.  "Be patient a minute; be ca'm, Barb; I'll tell you what I'm talking
about.  I don't know who cut his wire.  I don't know who done it and I won't undertake to say,
but what I do say to you, Barb, and I say it hard, you're making a big mistake on this man,
and if you don't slow up it'll cost you your life yet."

Doubleday was grimly silent.  "I've known Jim Laramie," Carpy went on, "since he was a boy.
He's stubborn as a broncho if you try to ride him.  He's the easiest man in the world to get
along with if you make a friend of him.  No matter what's said of Jim Laramie there ain't a
crooked hair in his head; but he's no angel and when his patience quits--look out.  What I'm
going to tell you now, Barb, is on the square.  It can't go no further.  I tell you because
you ought to know. A while back, just after this wire pulling, Jim Laramie walked into this
room, shut the door and locked it and sat down right where you're sittin' now.  He told me
the wire story; he told me he was through. He'd tracked the men to your ranch and was going
to square accounts with you and Stone and Van Horn.  He was on his way to the Junction and
he told me he might not come back and wanted to tell me how to dispose of his property.  He
was after you and he meant, before he fell down, to get some or all of you.  He asked me where
you were, because he heard I knew.  I did know but I didn't tell him.  I lied, Barb.  I told
him the mines, but I knew you were at the Junction.  He started for the mines.  What happened
to turn him off your trail I never yet learned. I never asked.

"Now you saw, or you heard anyway, what happened when Stone tried to kill him the other night.
That man never can get Laramie.  And don't depend on Stone and Van Horn to play you fair, for
if they had to save their hides, Barb, they'd sell you.  My advice is this: Put back Laramie's
wire.  Let the cattlemen, you and Pettigrew to lead 'em, do it to clear their own names.  Say
you know nothing about it, but it was a dirty trick, and tell this town that cattlemen fight
but they fight fair.  It'll do more to set you right and to set everything else right on the
range than anything else you could possibly do.  And don't make a mistake.  Laramie'll follow
that wire pulling for years but what he'll get the man that did it.  I know him.  He's got
a memory like an Indian."

Like all well-meaning and candid friends, the doctor found himself at once in for a deal of
angry abuse, but, as he explained, he had taken so much abuse from patients at various periods
of his career--and abuse fully justified--that nothing Barb could add, deserved or undeserved,
to the volume would move him: "As our old governor back in Wisconsin said, Barb, 'I seen my
duty and I done it,'" was the doctor's only retort to Doubleday's wrath.  "Now if you're in
a hurry, Barb, don't let me keep you, not a minute.  I had my say and if there's anything pressing
you down street go to it."

But angry as Doubleday appeared, Carpy had given him something to think about.  Consultations
were held--by precisely whom, no one could say, but in them there was dissension.  Van Horn
vehemently opposed any further overtures to Laramie and he was vastly put out at being overruled.
While the discussions were going on, he talked in a veiled but emphatic way to Kate about the
queer way her father was acting. Van Horn would shake his head with violent emphasis at the
way things were going.  But when Kate poured oil on the waters of his discontent, Van Horn
was always responsive and stayed to supper or for the evening, if he were asked--and Kate was
alone.  On the gentler side, however, he could make no headway.  When he tried headaches for
sympathy, Kate was stony hearted.  When he asked her one day at the spring to take down her
hair, she told him she wore a wig.  He looked at her amazed.

And in spite of his objections to placating Laramie a decision very unpalatable to him was
reached.  Pettigrew, as spokesman, approached Laramie and insisted, in order to allay bad feeling,
on replacing the barb wire.  When Laramie declared the wire must be put back by the men that
had cut it, there was naturally an impasse, but Tenison and Carpy aided jointly by the representations
of Lefever and Sawdy, induced Laramie to forego his punitive attitude and accept the amende
as offered.  This, as the doctor had predicted, put a pleasanter face on the tangled affairs
of the range.  And to strike while their iron was hot, and to keep it hot, the cattlemen announced
a big Fourth of July celebration, at which old scores should be forgotten and friends and enemies
meet in good-fellowship.  The place for it, after much talk, was fixed at Doubleday's ranch.
The saloon-keepers of Sleepy Cat, except Tenison, fought this, but they lost out.

Since her own home was to be the scene of the celebration, Kate took a particular interest
in the undertaking.  She made herself, in a way, hostess and her father gave her free rein.
The eager crowd that responded to the public invitation found awaiting them, as they picturesquely
rode in twos and threes and groups up the creek to the ranch house, all the "fixin's" for a
rousing celebration.  Men came for as much as fifty miles and some of them by trails and over
passes Kate had never even heard of.  There were cattlemen, cowboys, sheepmen, little ranchers--all
the conflicting elements of the country, besides a crowd from Sleepy Cat with the band, and
all the town loafers that could possibly secure conveyance.

There was for these latter worthies the attraction of a free feed--for they knew the prodigality
of cattlemen; but there was also the underlying hope that where so discordant elements were
assembled a fight might occur; and nobody wanted to miss a fight.  The principals necessary
for a serious affair were present.  The fact that all were armed was not significant, merely
prudent.  Men careless on this point were no longer attending celebrations of any sort around
Sleepy Cat.

From the Falling Wall came the rustlers, every one of them except Doubleday's old foreman,
Abe Hawk, who scorned all pretense of compromise.  He advised Laramie not to go near the celebration.
When Laramie intimated he might go, Abe was greatly incensed.  A master of bitter sarcasm,
he trained his batteries on his sandy-haired friend and these failing he warned him he would
be in serious danger.  He intimated that the scheme was to get the rustlers all together and
finish them in a bunch.  In which event, one as hated as Laramie could hardly hope to escape
unmolested.  But Laramie persisted in his resolve to go, and he went.

Doctor Carpy made it a point to go.  He was usually needed professionally at Fourth of July
celebrations.  But on this occasion he was, in matter of fact, a sort of sponsor for the whole
affair and he brought Sawdy, Lefever and Tenison along.  The four drove out in the smartest
wagon and behind the best team in the Kitchen barn, Kitchen with them and McAlpin driving.

By noon the big end of the crowd had arrived.  The barbecue tables were set out under the trees
along the creek.  The roasting itself was in the skilled hand of John Frying Pan and before
one o'clock he was ready to serve.

Doubleday had told Kate, when arranging for the tables, that his particular friends would sit
at his table, and she was on her way down to the creek to ask him how many there would be in
the party when whom should she find him talking with, of all men, but Laramie, who had just
ridden over from the Falling Wall.

Before Kate could retreat, her father had seen her.  He called her over.  To her astonishment
he insisted on introducing her to his friend, Jim Laramie, of whom he was making as much as
it was possible to make of a wholly undemonstrative man.

The band not far away was playing full tilt.  Kate wished they could have made even more noise
to hide her confusion, but there was nothing except to face the situation, much as it surprised
her.  Laramie, fortunately, seemed indisposed to say anything.  He spent most of his time listening.
Kate, being far from animated, her father was left to do the honors.  And on such rare occasions
as Barb was communicative, he was quite capable of good-fellowship.

Laramie, however, seemingly under some restraint, soon made excuses and left to join the crowd.

Some of the little ranchmen had brought their wives along.  A few of these women had their
babies with them, and Kate returned to the house, where she made the mothers comfortable. 
There, her father afterwards ran across her.  He stopped as he came up: "You remember that
man I introduced you to--Laramie?"

"Very well," assented Kate, wondering.

"Treat him well at dinner."

"But I'm going to eat here at the house."

He shook his head: "You eat at the creek at my table."

She had no choice but to obey.  When she returned to the pits the stones had been removed and
John Frying Pan, with a pair of Sleepy Cat ice tongs, was lifting out the first big chunks
of roasted meat.  The crowd, being called, ran for the creek whooping and yelling, and while
Kate watched John and his helpers dish up the meat, the guests--nearly all men--seated themselves
pell mell at the long benches.  It was a noisy assemblage, overflowing with good-nature, and
when Kate, very trim in corduroy, appeared again at the tables the demonstrative ones rose
and led in a burst of cheers.  Kate enjoyed it but when they began calling for a speech, she
ran to join her father.  She found him and old man Pettigrew at the table, Laramie calmly seated
with them and the fourth place waiting for her.

Van Horn, as host to other cattlemen and guests, presided at the next table.  Unluckily, where
he sat, he could see Laramie opposite Kate. But if he was discomfited, the group at the next
table below, where Doctor Carpy presided, flanked by Lefever, Sawdy, Kitchen and McAlpin, was
correspondingly elated at the spectacle of the Falling Wall and the Crazy Woman sitting in harmony.

Despite the unpleasant stories Kate had heard about him she found nothing to complain of in
Laramie's manners.  But he was, she told herself, on his good behavior, and under the circumstances
would naturally try to appear at his best.  Little as she relished her assignment of making
things pleasant for him, the friendly spirit of the occasion to some extent infected her, and
soon she found it not difficult to help along with small talk and make the queer combination
at the table go.

There was really no great need for her to work hard in this way--both her father and Pettigrew
were very lively.  Laramie seemed a bit dazed at being set up with such honors in the house
of his enemies.  But though he did not volunteer much, when Kate said anything that afforded
a chance for comment, he improved it.

The talk went a good deal to cattle, and range matters, but Pettigrew, a crafty fellow, told
good stories about men that everybody in and out of Sleepy Cat knew, and appealed frequently
to Laramie for confirmation or a laugh.  Some of the laughs he got were a little dry but they
were not ill-natured, and Kate enjoyed the rough humor.  The two cattlemen finished their dinner,
and without ceremony got up to see how the crowd was being served, leaving Kate with Laramie.
"How do you like old Pettigrew?" was the first thing Laramie asked as the bearded cattleman
moved away with her father.

"The only thing I don't like about him," answered Kate candidly, "is his eyes."

She was looking at Laramie as she spoke.

"You're a good observer," he said.

"How so?"

"A man's eyes are all there is to him.  You don't mind if I smoke?"

"Not a bit."

He drew a sack of tobacco from a breast pocket.

"Not going to run away, are you?"  He was fishing for cigarette paper when he asked.  He spoke
as if he had no special interest in the matter, yet the question startled her.  Kate had not
made a move to go, but she was thinking, when the question came, of how she might manage to
escape.  She flushed a little at being anticipated in her intention--just enough perhaps to
let him see he had caught her, not to say irritated her.  As luck would have it, Van Horn,
who had risen, sauntered towards them.  Kate was glad just then to see him: "I hope you got
enough to eat," she said as he approached.

He seemed stiff--Kate did not realize what he was put out about.  He made some answer and turned
to Laramie.  She felt at once the friction between the two men, not from anything she had reason
to suspect or know--for she knew then nothing whatever of their personal relations. Nor was
it from anything said; for an instant neither man spoke. Instinct must have made her conscious
for as soon as Van Horn looked at Laramie she felt the tension: "Well, Jim, where'd you blow
from?" demanded Van Horn after a pause.

Laramie was making ready to smoke.  He was in no haste to answer, nor did he look at Van Horn,
but continued, cowboy fashion, rolling his cigarette in the finger-tips of one hand, his other
hand resting on his hip: "I didn't blow," he retorted.

"How'd you get here?" asked Van Horn.

"I was invited."

Van Horn laughed significantly.  While Kate would rather have been out of it, she thought it
proper, since she was in it, to say something herself: "I didn't suppose anybody needed a special
invitation for a Fourth of July celebration," she interposed.  "The town has been covered for
two weeks with bills inviting everybody."

Van Horn laughed again.  "It wasn't you invited him, eh?" he demanded of Kate.  The thing was
said so unpleasantly she would have retorted on impulse, but Laramie took any possible words
out of her mouth.

"Why don't you ask me who invited me?  Barb Doubleday invited me. That's enough, isn't it?
And Pettigrew invited me.  And," he added, completing his cigarette in leisurely fashion, "while
that wouldn't be any particular inducement--you invited me."

Van Horn stared: "How do you make that out?" he asked quickly.

"You asked me to take in this barbecue when you tried to get me to line up with you at the
Mountain House."

Van Horn took alarm: "That was put up to you in confidence," he said angrily.

"So was the barbecue," responded Laramie.  "I wouldn't take in the first proposition, so I'm
enjoying the second."  He turned from Van Horn, and, ignoring him, spoke to Kate: "You remember
you said you were going to show me your ponies."

It was Kate's turn to stare: "You must be mistaken."

He did not press the subject: "Perhaps you've forgotten," was all he said.

"When or where did I ever say that?" Kate asked, resenting the intimation.

He looked down, then looking up his eyes rested on Kate's.  He was not disturbed: "Is that
a challenge?" he asked.

"If you wish to make it one," she returned coolly.

"The 'where' was one day at Sleepy Cat Junction, the 'when' was the day we rode up the Falling
Wall river."

"Oh," she exclaimed, collecting herself, "I had forgotten."

"Do you remember now?" he asked; and she thought there was resentment in the question.  "If
you don't," he added, "we'll let it go."

"Why, I suppose I must have said something like that.  Anyway," she added, "we'll go see them
to make sure I've kept a promise.  Come, Mr. Van Horn," she suggested, turning sweetly to him,
"don't you want to see the ponies?"  To include Van Horn, it was plain to be seen, would spoil
the trip for Laramie, but she cared little for that.  "Wait just a minute," she continued,
"I must tell John Frying Pan before I go to give the Indians something to eat."

The feeling between the two men she left together flared up at once: "Does this mean you're
going to hitch up with the cattlemen, after all?" demanded Van Horn.

Laramie, who had lighted his cigarette, stood looking after Kate: "I hitch up with nobody."

"Then don't spend your time hanging around Kate Doubleday."

"So that's where the shoe pinches?"  Laramie threw away his cigarette as he spoke.  "I've taken
a good deal from you, Van Horn."

Van Horn egged him on unabashed: "You've got your nerve with you to show up here at all."

"A man needs his nerve, Van Horn, to do business with crooks like you."

Doubleday, passing near the two men at that moment, heard the last exchange.  He called out
in his heavy, raspy voice to Van Horn:  "Look here, Harry."  Laramie walked away and Doubleday
took Van Horn in hand: "You messed up things once with Laramie, didn't you?  And you didn't
get him, did you?" continued Doubleday, choking off Van Horn's words: "Now we've got him here,
let me run this thing."

"I can tell you right now you won't line him up," blurted out Van Horn, very angry.

Doubleday had a way of raising his chin to override objection; and his voice grew huskier with
stubbornness: "Just let me run this thing, will you?"

"Do as you please," retorted Van Horn, but with a stiff expletive that irritated Barb still
further.  Then swinging on his heel, Van Horn marched off.  Barb was so incensed he could only
keep his raised finger pointed after Van Horn; and as his eyes blazed he shouted through a
very fog of throat-scraping: "I will."

CHAPTER XIII

AGAINST HIS RECORD

On the level stretch between the ranch-house and the creek the cowboys staged, after dinner,
a Frontier Day show and a Fourth of July celebration combined.  The fun began mildly with the
three-legged races and the business of the greased pig.  From these diversions it proceeded
to foot races, in which Indians shone, and to keenly contested pony races between cowboys,
Reservation bucks and sports from Sleepy Cat.  Money was stacked with freedom and differences
of opinion were intensified by victory and defeat.

While the spirit ran high, rodeo riding began with the master artists of the range and the
pink of American horsemanship in the saddle.  In each succeeding contest the Sleepy Cat visitors
headed by Sawdy and Lefever with big loose bunches of currency backed their favorites freely,
and men that counted nothing of caution in their make-up took the other end of every exciting
event.  Flushed faces and loud voices added to the rapidly shifting excitement as one event
followed another, and the betting fever keenly roused called, after every possible wager had
been laid, for fresh material to work on.

It was at this juncture that the shooting matches began.  In a line and in a country in which
many excelled in perhaps the most important regard, rivalry ran high and critics were naturally
fastidious.  The temptation to belittle even excellent work with rifle and revolver was, in
Sawdy and especially in Carpy, partly due to temperament.  Both men were bad gamesters because
they bet on feeling rather than judgment. They would back a man, or the horse of a man they
liked, against a man they did not like and sometimes thereby knew what it was to close the
day with empty pockets.

On this Fourth of July at Doubleday's, both men, as well as Lefever, had been hit by hard luck.
Their free criticism of the horse-racing and the shooting did not pass unresented and the fact
that Tom Stone and his following had most of the Sleepy Cat money while the sun was still high
did not tend to temper the acerbity of their remarks.

Nothing that the crack shots of the range could do would satisfy either Sawdy or Carpy.  Van
Horn, himself an expert with rifle and gun, was master of these ceremonies and the belittling
by the Sleepy Cat sports of the best the cowboys could show, nettled him: "Before you knock
this any more," he said, "put up some better shooting."

The taunt went far enough home to stir the fault-finders.  Sawdy and Carpy took grumpy counsel
together.  Presently they hunted up Laramie, who in front of the ranch-house was talking horses
with Kitchen and Doubleday.  They told him the situation and asked for help: "Come over to
the creek and show the bunch up, Jim," was Sawdy's appeal.

The response was cold.  Laramie refused to take any part in the shooting.  Sawdy could not
move him.  In revenge he borrowed what money Laramie had--not much in all--and went back in
bad humor.  With the peeve of defeated men, the Sleepy Cat sports called for more horse racing
to retrieve their fortunes--only to lose what money they had left and suffer fresh jeering
from Van Horn and his following.

But abating in defeat and with empty pockets, nothing of their confident swagger, Carpy and
Sawdy reinforced this time by Lefever--McAlpin trailing along as a mourner--headed again for
the ranch-house after Laramie.

They found him on a bench where he could command the front door, whittling and talking idly
with Bill Bradley.  Laramie was there intent on waylaying Kate, within.  His friends descended
on him for the second time in a body.  They laid their discomfiture before him.  They begged
him to pull them out of the hole.  It was too much in the circumstances to refuse men he counted
on when he, himself, needed friends, but he yielded with an ill grace: "What do you want me
to do?" he demanded finally.

They told him.  He would not stand up before a target, nor would he shoot in competition with
anybody else.

"I've only got a few cartridges, anyway," he objected.  "Suppose when they're shot away these
fellows get a fight going on me?"

It was argued that there were enough gunmen in the Sleepy Cat crowd for defensive purposes
and that there was no end of available ammunition. A way was found to meet Laramie's objection
on every point and it only remained to hatch up a scheme for lightening the cattlemen's pockets.

With Carpy, Lefever and Sawdy, Laramie sat down apart.  An exchange of views took place.  Sawdy
had in mind something he had once seen Laramie achieve and on this--and the possibility of
its success--the talk centered.  The feat, it was conceded, would be a stiff one.  It was put
up to Laramie; he consented, after some wrangling and with misgivings, to try to save the day
for his misguided Sleepy Cat friends.  The moment consent was assured, his backers hurried
away in a body--McAlpin as crier, Lefever and Sawdy to raise money, and Carpy to bully Van
Horn and Stone and their following.

The news that Laramie would shoot caused a stir.  Not everyone present had seen him shoot.
His reputed mastery of rifle and gun was often in question; and no more grueling test before
friends and enemies could ever be given than what he was to attempt now.

Not everyone got clearly as the talk went on just what the trial was to be.  Sawdy having reinforced
his resources, announced the event as Laramie against his record--to tie or to beat.

Laramie, himself, unmindful of the controversy, held to the bench.  He was still sitting, head
down, and still whittling, when Bradley came to say the crowd was waiting.  He asked Bradley
to bring up his horse.

Kate coming out of the house drew his attention.  He threw away the stick in his hand and rose.

"I hear you are going to shoot," she said.

"Can't get out of it very well, I guess."

"You wouldn't shoot, the time I asked you to."

"I didn't actually refuse, did I?"

"Pretty near it."

"It's a harder case today.  Your men have got all the money.  My friends are broke.  And they've
asked me to help them out somehow. That's the only reason.  If you really want to see me shoot,
all you've got to do is to tell me the next time you see me."

"Oh, I'm going to see you shoot now."  She looked at the gun holster slung at his left hip.
"I hear you are left-handed."

"They've got work enough lined up today for two hands."

Bradley returned with the horse and climbed awkwardly down from the saddle.  Laramie tried
the cinches and turned to Kate.

"Are you all ready?" she asked.

"Just about."

"You try the cinches; I should think you'd want to try your gun."

"I tried that this morning before I left home.  All I've got to do before I begin is to slip
an extra cartridge into the cylinder."

Leading his pony, Laramie, clinging to the talk as long as he could, walked with Kate toward
the creek.  Leaving her on a slight rise, where he told her he thought she could see, he got
into the saddle and rode down to where the crowd had assembled.

On a stretch of the trail extending along the creek, John Frying Pan, under the direction of
Sawdy and Van Horn, was placing at intervals of from fifty to one hundred and fifty yards a
series of targets.  These were ordinary potatoes, left over from the barbecue, but selected
with great care as to size and shape by the man whose money was up--Sawdy; Frying Pan's work
was to impale them on low-growing scrub along the trail to serve as targets.  Against these
targets--six in number--Laramie was to undertake to ride and to split five out of the six as
he galloped past them with six and no more bullets.  The potatoes were up when Laramie joined
Sawdy, and Lefever with leather lungs announced the terms of the test.  Accompanied by Sawdy,
Van Horn and Frying Pan, Laramie rode slowly down the course--a quarter of a mile long--examining
the roadway and the targets.  Here and there a loose stone was removed from the trail; one
potato was moved from a dip in the course to a safer point; one was raised and one placed more
clearly in sight.

Having ridden to the end, Laramie expressed himself as satisfied with the conditions.  Alone,
he went back over the course and starting down the creek made a trial heat at full speed past
the targets.  One of these at his request was shifted again.  While he watched this change,
Sawdy and Lefever, surrounded by their followers, were crowding him as race touts crowd a favorite
jockey with final words of admonition and advice.  When the one target was satisfactorily adjusted,
Laramie breaking away from everybody returned alone to the starting point. Dismounting, and
taking his time to everything, he again tested his cinches, drew his gun from its holster and
breaking it slipped a sixth cartridge into the cylinder.  Dropping the gun back into place,
he pulled his hat a little lower, glanced down the course and up toward the little hill on
which he had parted from Kate.  She was standing where he left her but Van Horn had ridden
up and, joining Kate, was talking to her.  While she listened to him she watched the preparations
below.

Laramie spoke to his pony, patted him on the neck and mounted. Wheeling, he swung out into
a wide circle across the level bench and with gradually increasing speed into a measured gallop.
Molded into one flesh with his mount, Laramie, impassive in the saddle as a statue, watched
and nursed to his liking the pony's gait.  When the rhythm suited, he urged the horse to a
longer stride and circling back into the course, drew his gun, held it high in the air and,
swinging it slowly as if like a lariat, bore down at full speed on the first target.

Markers for both sides in the betting stood to watch each potato.  No signal would mean the
potato had been missed; for each hit, a hat was to be thrown into the air.  In a complete silence
among the spectators every eye was fixed on Laramie.  Those close at hand saw him, with his
left arm still high in the air, sway slightly backward and slowly forward, while with the circling
gun poised at arm's length he shrank closer and lower into the saddle.  When he neared the
first target, throwing his left arm toward it like a bolt, he fired, sped on and was again
swinging his gun.  He had hardly covered six more paces before a hat was tossed into the air
behind him.

A yell went up from his friends.  Horsemen wheeled into the course behind the flying marksman.
With five potatoes still to negotiate they were afraid to cheer.  But as one hat after another
along the shooting line--the second, the third and the fourth--were tossed up from the target
behind the speeding horseman, the Sleepy Cat men bellowed with joyful confidence.  The fifth
target was of unusual distance--a hundred and fifty yards--from the fourth.  Leaving the fourth,
Laramie's horse broke and the onlookers saw that his rider was in trouble.  He kept the swing
of his gun without breaking the rhythm, but his efforts were in his bridle arm to steady his horse.

The hopes of his backers fell as they saw how stubborn the pony had become.  The hundred and
fifty yards were barely enough to bring him under control.  Laramie still circling his raised
gun did bring him under.  But he was already nearing the fifth target.  And to the horror of
his friends passed it without attempting to fire.

Of the two chances left him to tie--which meant to win--he had passed up one; the sixth and
last meant life or death to the shaken hopes of his backers.

They saw him settled once more into the long, even stride he needed for the shot and their
breaths hung on each flying leap that brought the rider nearer his last chance.  The sixth
target was separated by barely fifty yards from the fifth.  Laramie had covered half the distance
when he completely reversed his form.  He stretched gradually up in the saddle and riding close
in on the target itself, rose to his full height in the stirrups and smashed his fifth shot
almost straight down on it; the potato split into a dozen fragments.  Bill Bradley at the sixth
was watching for Sawdy; his hat sailed twenty feet in the air. The yelling crowd rode Laramie
down as he galloped in a long circle back, his lines swung on his forearm, while he slipped
four fresh cartridges into the warm cylinder of his revolver.

He dismounted to ease his cinches.  "I guess I over-did it," he explained to the friends that
crowded closest.  "I got the cinches a little tight.  The pony didn't like it.  I couldn't
get the gait in time for the Number Five.  But I knew I could make Number Six."

Remounting, he made his way through the crowd back over the course. Kate was still on the hill.
"You won, didn't you?" she cried as he rode toward her.

"If I hadn't, I guess I'd have had to head straight across the creek for home.  Could you see?"

"I watched you the whole way.  What a long arm you have."

"While these tin horns are counting their money, would you like to show me the ponies?"

"You have a long memory, too."

"I was brought up a good deal with Indians.  Shall I hunt up Van Horn to go with us?"

She darted a quick glance at him: "Why, yes, surely," she retorted, "if you want him."

Laramie was tearing out a cigarette paper: "I could look at them without him," he returned calmly.

"I don't see him, anyway," murmured Kate, professing to sweep the crowded course with her eyes.

"Don't look too hard," cautioned Laramie.

"I suppose we might save time," she suggested, ignoring his last remark, "by going without him."

CHAPTER XIV

LEFEVER ASKS QUESTIONS

Those closest to headquarters sometimes know least of what is going on. That the big celebration
at the ranch could have been anything more or less than what it professed to be, did not occur
to Kate; nor could anyone actually say that it was more or less.  Hawk could contemptuously
refuse its overtures; Laramie could for reasons of his own accept them; the Falling Wall rustlers
were out for a good time or they would not have been rustling and they would celebrate any
time at anybody's expense--except their own; Carpy could believe it was to usher in a better
feeling--everyone to his taste.

But the suspicious, because they did not quite understand such a move, harbored their suspicions,
and among the doubting was Belle Shockley--shrewd and very much alive to the drift of things
since her struggle with a cyclone.  Had Belle, instead of Kate, been out at the ranch, things
now coming along that Kate failed to see, would have told volumes to her.

But Kate did not feel at liberty to make of Belle a confidant in everything--certainly not
in what happened at home; so she neither said anything to Belle nor asked of her any explanation
of things that she herself did not understand--such as guarded and more frequent consultations
between her father and Van Horn, Pettigrew and Stone; and such as men riding up with a clatter
to the ranch-house at night and calling Doubleday out and calling for Van Horn who often now
spent the night at the ranch and left before daybreak.

Some of this, Kate saw.  She could see how absent-minded her father was.  He grew so taciturn
she hardly knew him but the reason for it was beyond her.  More than she saw, she picked up
from Bradley, working then at the ranch.  Bradley had taken a liking to Kate and often reminded
her of the night he brought her into the Falling Wall country.

Whenever she was in Sleepy Cat, Belle was inquisitive.  She always wanted to know what Van
Horn was doing, what her father was doing, and then fell back on vaguely general questions
about ranches and the range and rustlers.  More than once she spoke of strangers in town, Texas
men--cowboys and gunmen she called them--who bothered her for meals, and whom she scornfully
sent packing.

And Henry Sawdy, too, one of her frequent visitors, was trying to court her, she complained;
all this made her suspicious.  Of whom? Of what? Kate asked.  Belle could not tell exactly
of whom, of what--she was just suspicious: "Why should that big fat man come courting me?"
she demanded one day when Kate had come in for lunch.

"You don't think it possible he likes you?" suggested Kate, barely glancing Belle's way, and
taking care to make her tone very skeptical. Belle only snorted contemptuously and turned to
her cooking; but as she did so, she gave her wig a punch.

By the merest chance, John Lefever came in a few minutes later.  Belle and Kate were at the
table.  John asked for something to eat.  When Belle wanted to be rid of him he refused "no"
for an answer:

"You wouldn't send me away without a cup of coffee, would you?  No potatoes?  Well, I never
eat potatoes"--John coughed.  "They are fattening."  Then he looked up cheerfully as if a new
idea had struck him: "What's the matter with a little soft-boiled ice cream?"

The upshot was that he had to be asked to share the lunch which he did with relish, paying
his way with his usual foolery.  When the plates were emptied and John had officiously asked
leave to light a cigarette, he glanced toward the folding bed and asked Belle to play something.

"That's no piano," exclaimed Belle, with contempt.  "That's a bed."

John seemed undisturbed: "Curious," he mused, "we used to have an upright piano at home with
that same kind of wood, same pattern exactly; you could have that bed made over into a piano,
Belle. Straighten out the springs and you wouldn't have to buy hardly any wire at all."

Belle stared at him: "Where would I sleep if I did?" she demanded.

John threw back his head, blew a delicate puff of smoke toward the ceiling and looked across
at his unsympathetic hostess.  Then he brought his fist down on the table; "Marry me, Belle,
and sleep in a regular bed!  What?"

Belle was justly indignant.  Kate's laughing made her more indignant. For John had fairly bubbled
his proposal through a laugh of his own.

"I used to sleep in a box like that myself," he went on.  "But the year it was so dry the grasshoppers
got into it."  John coughed again unobtrusively.  "I raffled that bed off," he continued, low
and reminiscently.  "A conductor won it.  But it didn't fool him.  He knew the bed as well
as I did; he'd slept in it.  So I bought it in again, cheap, and traded it to an old Indian
buck--a one-eyed man--for a pony. Many a time I've laughed, thinking of that bed up on the
Reservation. Those bucks, you know, are desperate gamblers.  I understand they've been playing
hearts with that blamed bed ever since and putting it on the high man."

At this, John laughed harder than ever, Belle sputtering as she watched him.

Then he turned his amiable face on Kate: "How are you all at the home?"

"Very well."

"What's the news up your way?"

"Not a thing since the Fourth of July."

"Father pretty well?"

"Quite."

"When did you see him last?"

It was an odd question:  "Last night--why?" asked Kate in turn.

"He didn't come in town with you today?" countered John.

"He rarely does," said Kate.

John nodded soothing assent to her explanation: "How's Van Horn?" he asked casually.  "And
Stone?" he added, with undiminished interest. "All well," was his echo to her perfunctory answers.
"Say, Belle, was Jim Laramie in town yesterday?"

Belle shook her head.  "How about the day before?" he asked.  Again she said, "no"; and went
on with an impatient comment of her own: "You're always asking questions.  What for?  That's
what I want to know."

John laid his cigarette on the rim of his plate and appealed to Kate: "Did you ever in your
life see a more unreasonable woman than Belle? How am I to find things out without asking questions
of my friends? And among them I number you both," he added.

Leaning forward, he spoke on: "Now I'll tell you why I asked those harmless little questions--for
I wouldn't ask either of you any other kind.  This news will get to each of you, about evening.
By morning it will be all over Sleepy Cat and by tomorrow noon across the Spanish Sinks.  This
morning, early, Van Horn, Tom Stone, Pettigrew with Bradley, and a bunch of Texas men and cowboys
rode over into the Falling Wall country and there's been hell to pay there every minute since
daylight--that's the word I got about half an hour ago, by telephone, from a little ranch away
up on the head-waters of the Crazy Woman."

He drew his handkerchief and wiped his brow.  "The only man up there--Belle knows that--that
I'm any ways interested in, is Jim Laramie.  According to what I can hear, Jim is home.  That's
worrying me just a little.

"What will Jim do?  That's what I'm thinking of.  How will he stack up if that bunch goes to
his ranch on the Turkey?  He hates 'em like poison.  They've gone up there, you understand,"
he added, speaking to Kate, as if some further explanation were due a comparative stranger,
"to clean out the rustlers.  You can imagine it'll be done--or at least attempted--without
much talk.  There won't be very much talk.  I've known for some little time what's been going
forward.  They tried to get Jim to join them; offered him about anything he wanted; offered
to see that the contests on his preemption and homestead be withdrawn; offered him quite a
bunch of cattle, I heard; and some money."

Belle's face, her staring eyes and strained expression as she listened, showed how well she
knew what the news meant.  "What answer did Jim give?" she asked anxiously.

"From what I can pick up," declared John, dropping calmly into the inelegant expression, "he
told 'em to go to hell.

"That's what I'm worrying about now.  Not about their going, but about what Jim will do.  What
do you think, Belle?"

Belle shook her head; she offered no comment.

"And," John added, looking at Kate, "that was hatched mostly, right at your place.  And they
rode away from there about two o'clock this morning.  That's why I was pumping you a little,
till I see you didn't know a thing about it."

Why Kate had not asked before, she could not tell; but the possibility never crossed her mind--until
Lefever told her of their starting from the ranch that morning--that her father might have
gone.  She recollected now she had not seen him, as she usually saw him, the first thing when
she came from her room.  Her heart leaped into her throat: "Was my father with them?" she asked.

She must have shown her excitement and fear in her manner, as well as in her words, for Lefever
looked at her considerately: "According to my reports," he answered carefully, "your father
was with them."

"Godfrey!" muttered Belle.  Kate could say nothing.

CHAPTER XV

THE RAID OF THE FALLING WALL

Against the alert, the effective blow is a sudden blow.  Secrecy, and a surprise, were the
only hope of success in what the cattlemen were now attempting in the Falling Wall.  Of the
men on whom they could count to organize and carry through such a raid, they had just one capable
of energizing every detail--Harry Van Horn.  Laramie, the man Doubleday and Pettigrew would
have chosen, they had failed to enlist, and what was more serious--though this, perhaps, Doubleday
did not realize--they had likewise failed to rid themselves of; Tom Stone had bungled.

But Doubleday in especial was not a man to lose time over a failure. He knew that Van Horn
had "go" enough in him to clean out a whole county if he were given the men and backing, and
that he stood high in the councils of the range.  When Van Horn spoke, men listened.  His eye
flashed with his words and his long, straight hair shook defiance at opposition.  He swore
with a staccato that really meant things and cut like a knife.  When once started, mercy was
not in him.

In the Falling Wall park there lived a mere handful of men, and these widely scattered; but
Van Horn was the last man to underestimate the handful he was after.  He knew them every one,
and knew that no better men ever rode the range than Stormy Gorman, Dutch Henry, Yankee Robinson
and Abe Hawk, and their associates--if, indeed, for a man that never mixed with other men,
Hawk could be said to have associates.

But the four named were the men to whom the lesser rustlers of the park looked; the men whose
exploits they imitated, and these were the men on whose heads a price had, in effect, been set.

Van Horn assembled his men, earlier than Lefever had been informed.  An old trail from Doubleday's
ranch to the Falling Wall crosses the road to the Fort some distance north of Sleepy Cat. 
The party from the ranch--Tom Stone with some of the most reckless cowboys and Doubleday--waited
there for the Texans whom Van Horn was bringing from Pettigrew's.  Both parties were at the
rendezvous that night by twelve o'clock, and within thirty minutes were headed north by way
of the Crazy Woman for Falling Wall park.

The night for the raid had been chosen.  The sky was overcast, and when the party left the
crossing between twelve and one o'clock their exact destination was still a secret to the greater
number.  Small ranchers along the creek might have wakened at the smart clatter of so many
horses, but men to and from the Fort traveled late at times and made even more noise.  This
night there were riders abroad; but there was no singing.

Dawn was whitening the eastern sky when the raiding party halted near a clump of trees on the
south fork of the Turkey.  The valley into which they had ridden during the night was very
broken, but offered good grazing.  Along the tortuous water course, Stormy Gorman, the old
prize-fighter, and Dutch Henry, the ex-soldier, had preempted two of the very few pieces of
land that did not stand directly on edge and built for themselves cabins.  Gorman's cabin lay
a mile above the fork where the raiders had halted; Henry's lay a few miles farther up the creek.

During the long night ride it had been decided to strike at Gorman's ranch first; thence to
follow the creek trail up to Dutch Henry's, despatch him in turn, to cross rapidly a narrow
rough divide beyond which they could reach Hawk's cabin on the east fork of the Turkey and
thence sweep into the northwest to clean out the smaller fry--the "chicken feed" rustlers--as
Van Horn called them.  But toward morning, following much ill-natured dispute between Stone
and Van Horn, the tactics were changed.  It was decided to go after Dutch Henry first--as the
more alert and slippery of the two--and as quietly as possible the silent invaders rode slowly
along the creek past Gorman's place up to Henry's.

Day was breaking as the riders, dismounting and leaving their horses on the creek bottom, crept
noiselessly, under Stone's guidance, up a wash to the bench on which Henry's cabin stood. 
Hiding just below a shallow bank at the head of a draw, they lay awaiting developments.  Where
Stone had posted them they commanded the cabin perfectly.  He had lived part of one year with
Henry when they two preyed jointly on the range and he knew the ground well.

They had hardly disposed of themselves in this manner and were beginning, in the gray dusk,
to distinguish objects with some certainty, when the door of the distant cabin opened and a
mongrel collie bounded out followed by a man who left the door ajar.  The man, carrying a water
pail, set it down, yawned, stretched himself and tucked his shirt slowly inside his trousers.
Wild with joy the dog danced, leaped and barked about his master--only to be rewarded by a
kick that sent him yelping to a little distance, where turning, crouching with extended paws,
whining and frantically wagging his tail, the poor beast tried to beg forgiveness for its half-starved
happiness. The man, giving this demonstration no heed, picked up the pail and started for the
creek.

His path took him in a direction roughly parallel to the line along which his hidden enemy lay.

"Don't fire at that man," exclaimed Van Horn to his companions under cover of the draw.  "That's
not Dutch Henry," he whispered the next moment.  "Don't fire.  I'll take care of him."

The rustler, quite unconscious of his deadly danger, tramped unevenly on.  His dog, no longer
repulsed, dashed joyously back and forth, scenting the trails of the night and barking wildly
at his master by turns.  The man was walking hardly three hundred yards from where Stone, rifle
in hand, lay, and had reached the footpath leading from the bench to the creek bottom when
Stone, half rising, covered him slowly with point-blank sights.  In the path ahead, the dog
had struck a fresh gopher hole and, still yelping, was pawing madly into it, when a rifle cracked.
The man with the pail, swung violently half around by the shock of a spreading bullet, jerked
convulsively and the pail flew clattering from his hand.  He struggled an instant to keep his
footing, then collapsing, fell prone across the path and lay quite still.

Stone, followed by a man nearest him, scrambling down the draw, hurried along the creek bottom,
and ran up to reach the path where the murdered man lay.  The dog, barking and dashing wildly
around his prostrate master, spied the foreman and sprang furiously down the trail at him.
Stone, rifle in one hand and revolver in the other, was ready, and, firing from the hip, broke
the collie's back.  With a howl the stricken brute turned, and, dragging his helpless hindquarters
along the ground with incredible swiftness, pawed himself back to the dying man's head and
yelping, licked frantically at the hand of his master.  Coming up into plain sight, Stone got
a good look at the man he had killed: "Stormy Gorman!" he exclaimed, with an oath of surprise.
"Who'd 'a' thought," he continued, "that big bum would be up at Dutch Henry's this morning!"

The old prize-fighter was struggling in his last round.  His heavy-lidded eyes, swollen with
drink and sleep, were closed, and from his mouth, as his head hung to one side, a dark stream
ran to a little pool in the dust.  Only a stertorous breathing reflected his effort to live
and even this was fast failing.  Van Horn hurried up the path from the bottom, whither he had
followed Stone; anger was all over his face: "Kill that damned dog," he exclaimed, out of breath,
to those about him.  Two of the three men drew revolvers and shot the collie through the head.

"Damnation!" cried Van Horn in a fury.  "Stop your shooting.  Couldn't you knock him in the
head?  Do you want to start up the whole country?" he demanded, as he saw the man who lay at
his feet and had taken the brief count for eternity was Gorman.  He turned on Stone with rage
in his eyes and his voice: "Now," he cried, punctuating his abuse with the fiercest gestures,
"you've done it, haven't you!"  Anger almost choked him.  "You've got Gorman with a brass band
and left Dutch Henry in the cabin waiting for us, haven't you?  Why," he roared, "didn't you
obey orders, let this tank get down to the bottom and knock him on the head into the creek?"
A violent recrimination between Stone and Van Horn followed.  But the milk was spilt as well
as the blood of the stubborn rustler, and there was nothing for it but new dispositions.

Gorman's presence indicated that Henry was at home.  If he were at home, he was, no doubt,
within the cabin; but just how, after Stone's blunder, to get at him, was a vexing question.

Van Horn started down the foot trail back to the bottom and around to the first hiding place.
Lingering with a companion to look at Gorman in his blood, Stone turned for approval: "See
where I hit him?" he grinned.  "Poor light, too."

A brief council was held in the draw.  Watched for more than an hour, not the slightest sign
of life about the lonely cabin could be detected.  Various expedients, none of them very novel,
were tried to draw Henry's fire should he be within.  But these were of no avail.  A dozen
theories were advanced as to where Henry might or might not be. To every appearance there was
not, so far as the enemy could judge, a living man within miles of the spot.  The older heads,
Pettigrew, Doubleday, Van Horn, even Stone, talked less than the others; but they were by no
means convinced that the house was empty.

One of the least patient of the cowboys at length deliberately exposed himself to fire from
the sphinx-like cabin.  He stood up and walked up and down the edge of the draw.  Nothing happened.
Emboldened, he started out into the open and toward the cabin.  No shot greeted him. A companion,
jumping up, hurried after him; a third, a Texas boy, sprang up to join them.  For those watching
from hiding it was a ticklish moment.  Toward the draw there was a considerable growth of mountain
blue-stem, none of it very high and gradually shortening nearer the house.  The three men were
hastening through the grass, separated by intervals of perhaps fifty feet.  The foremost got
within a hundred yards of the cabin door, which still stood open as Gorman had left it, before
Van Horn's fear of an ambush vanished.  He himself, not to be too far behind his followers,
then rose to join the procession through the blue stem and the crack of a rifle was heard.
Van Horn, with a shout of warning, dropped unhurt into the draw.  But the last man of the three
in the field stumbled as if struck by an ax.  Of the two men ahead of him, the hindermost dropped
into the grass and crawled snakelike back; the man in front dropped his rifle and started at
top speed for safety; from the edge of the draw his companions sent a fusillade of rifle fire
at the cabin.

Apparently the diversion had no effect on the marksman within.  He fired again; this time at
the Texan crawling in the blue stem, and the half-hidden man, almost lifted from the ground
by the blow of the bullet, dropped limp.  Meantime the first cowboy in his dash for safety
was making a record still unequaled in mountain story.  He jumped like a broncho and zig-zagged
like a darting bird, but faster than either. The efforts of his companions to divert attention
from him were constant.  Some of them poured bullets at the cabin.  Others jumped to their
feet, and, yelling, sprang from point to point to expose themselves momentarily and draw the
fire of the enemy.  This was of no avail.  The hidden rifle with deliberate instancy cracked
once more. The fleeing cowboy, slammed as if by a club, dashed on, but his right arm hung limp.
No snipe ever made half the race for life that he put up in those fleeting seconds; and by
his agility he earned then and there the nickname of the bird itself, for before the deadly
sights could cover his flight again he threw himself into a slight depression that effectually
hid him from the range of the enemy.

A swarm of hornets, roused, could not have been more furious than the company under the lee
of the draw.  Shooting, shouting, cursing deep and loud, they made continual effort to keep
the deadly fire off their fallen companions.  They saw the half-open door of the cabin swing
now slowly shut and they riddled it with bullets.  They splintered the logs about it and, scattering
in as wide an arc as they dare, continued to pour a fire into the silent cabin.  At intervals
they paused to wait for a return.  There was no return.  All ruses they had ever heard of they
tried over again to draw a fire and exhaust the besieged man's ammunition.  Nothing moved the
lone enemy--if he were, indeed, alone. The day wore into afternoon.  By shouting, the assailants
learned that two of their three hapless companions lying in the blue stem were still alive--the
Snipe very much alive, as his stentorian answers indicated. He called vigorously for water
but got none.  His refuge was too exposed.

How to get rid of Dutch Henry taxed the wits of the invaders.  The whole morning and the early
afternoon went to pot-luck firing from the trench along the draw, but although it was often
asserted that Henry must long since be dead--having returned none of the shooting that was
meant to call his fire--no one manifested the curiosity necessary to prove the assertion by
closing in on the cabin.  Stone was still sulking over Van Horn's sharp talk of the morning
when Van Horn came over to where the foreman had posted himself to cover the cabin door: "We've
got to get that guy before dark, Tom, or he'll slip us."

"All right," replied Stone, "get him."

CHAPTER XVI

THE GO-DEVIL

"I want a wagon," scowled Van Horn.  "There's one down at Gorman's place he won't need any
more.  There's some baled hay down there, too. Take the men you need, load what hay you can
find on the wagon and hustle it up here."

Too stubborn to ask questions, and only starting after many hard words--with which all the
ground of the morning quarrel and much more was traversed--Stone took two men and started reluctantly
for Gorman's. He spent a long time on his job, but came back as directed with the wagon loaded
with hay.

The wagon was not much to view.  It looked like the wagon of a man that spent more time in
Sleepy Cat saloons than on his ranch.  A rack, equally old and dilapidated, had been set on
the running gear.  The paint had long since blown off the wheels, and one of these, a front
wheel, had lost a tire on the rough trip up the creek.  But the felloes hung to the spokes
and the spokes to the hub.

Van Horn inspected the outfit grimly.  With half a dozen men he set quickly to work and under
his resourceful ingenuity the wagon and hay were speedily turned into what would now-a-days
be termed a tank.  Only lack of hay kept him from making a mobile fortress of it.  By means
of wire he slung along the sides what baled hay he could spare, and with much effort to avoid
exposure the armored wagon was dragged over the roughest kind of ground, to the north and west
of the cabin.  From this direction the ground, fairly smooth, sloped from a ridge fringed by
jutting patches of rock, directly toward the cabin itself and eager hands made the final preparations
to smoke Henry out.  With the load of hay set ablaze and the wagon run down against the cabin
the defender was bound to be driven from cover or burnt.

When the bustling, contradicting and confusion finally subsided, the wagon was stealthily pushed
over the ridge, the hay fired and the blazing outfit, christened a go-devil, was started with
a shout down the slope.

If there existed in the minds of those that talked least a lingering suspicion that Dutch Henry
was still alive it was soon strongly justified.  Before the wagon had rolled twenty feet the
challenge of a rifle-shot from the cabin answered the attack.  Everybody dodged quick, but
no one was hit and a yell of derision rose from behind the rocks. With ropes, borrowed from
the men that carried them, and knotted together, the wagon was kept under partial control and
the line, as paid out, served in some measure to guide it.  On it went accompanied with shouts
and yells.  From the threatened cabin came no answering defiance.  Henry's case looked bad
as the wagon rolled down on him, but his rifle fire, though seemingly wasted, answered unflinchingly.

Stone danced with joy: "He'll be running the gauntlet next clip.  He's not hitting anybody.
He must be shooting," yelled the excited foreman, "at the blamed wagon."

A steady fire, undismayed, did continue to come from the cabin.  Van Horn, who had run to the
extreme right of the new sector, and was keeping a close watch on the go-devil, was the first
to perceive trouble.  "Hell's delight, boys," he cried, taken aback, "he's shooting up the wheels."

The words flew around behind the rocks.  The rifle fire was explained. Every eye was turned
to the danger point, the wheel without the tire which, as the wagon wobbled, was unluckily
exposed to the cabin fire. It could easily be seen where the deliberate marksman was getting
in his work.  He had knocked one felloe off the rim and was hitting at the spokes.  It began
to look like a race between the burning wagon and Henry at bay.  The hay was a mound of flame
and sparks and smoke shot high into the air.  A hundred feet more would lodge the fire trap
against the rear wall of the cabin.  But under the steady pounding of a rifle that seemed never
to miss its mark the injured wheel showed fast increasing signs of distress.  A second felloe
was tracking uncertainly.

As a diversion, Van Horn, active, energetic and covering every part of his little line at once,
ordered an incessant fire centered on the threatened cabin.  Nothing seemed to check the regular
report of the hidden high-powered rifle and the bullets that were splintering the old oak spokes.
When the roaring wagon struck a loose stone or rough spot in its trackless path it wobbled
and hesitated.  Yet, jerked, steadied, halted and started by means of the long cable, it rolled
to within twenty yards of its mark.  There it pitched a bit, recovered and for another ten
yards sailed down a smooth piece of ground.  The cowboys were yelling their loudest when a
lucky shot from the cabin knocked off a second felloe.  A second and third shot smashed rapidly
through the spokes of the staggering wheel.  A threatening boulder lying to the right of the
wagon's course could not be avoided.  The men on the line jerked and swore.  It was useless.
One side of the wheel collapsed, the front axle swung around and the blazing wagon straddled
the troublesome boulder like a stranded ship.  The men guiding heaved to on the line--it parted;
the cabin stood safe.

At once, the rifle fire from the cabin ceased.  No taunt, no threat could draw another shot
from the silence.  Chagrined, eyes flashing, silent in his defeat, Van Horn, contemplating
the last of the burning wagon and watching the cabin as a dog, baffled, watches a cat on a
fence, was let alone even by the most reckless of his companions; for the failure no one tried
to bait him.  Nor were he and Doubleday ready to quit.  They got ready a circle of fires to
block any attempt made to escape the beleaguered place after dark.  This proved a difficult
undertaking, both because fuel was scarce and because the dead line, drawn by the rifle fire
of the wary defender, extended a long way in every direction around his log refuge.

The night, however, was fairly clear and a pretty good moon was due by ten o'clock.  The fires
were lighted, not without some sharp objection from the cabin, the moment darkness fell.  The
difficulty then was to keep them replenished and maintain an adequate guard.  Dark spots and
shadows fell within and across the circle around the cabin.  Van Horn ordered a rifle fire
directed into these places; it was placed so persistently that when the moon rose, the besiegers
felt pretty confident Henry had not escaped.  And just before its light had penetrated the
narrow valley, the invaders had a cheering surprise when the wounded man, nicknamed "The Snipe,"
crawled from his hollow between the lines back to his comrades and told them in immoderate
terms what he thought of them for leaving him wounded and thirsty under the enemy fire.  Volunteers,
inspired by his abuse, crawled out to the second man that had fallen in the morning and by
really heroic effort got him back into the draw; badly hit, he was given long-needed attention.
The first man, shot through the head, the rescuers reported dead.

When midnight came, the men had been fed and the watch well maintained. A steer, interned earlier,
had been cut up for the men's supper and Van Horn and Doubleday were seated together before
the camp fire near the creek eating some of the reserve chunks of meat when a hurried alarm
called them up the draw--the cabin was on fire.

Nothing could have happened to take the besiegers more by surprise. There was hasty questioning
but no explanation.  Of all the possibilities of the night none could have been so unexpected.
But whatever the cause, and theories were broached fast, the cabin was ablaze.  Smoke could
be seen pouring through the chinks in the roof and little tongues of flame darted out at the
rear under the eaves.  Though there was not a breath of air stirring, the roof within fifteen
minutes was in flames and the cowboys, confident of victory, set up, Indian fashion, their
death chant for Dutch Henry.

The old shack made a good fire.  The roof collapsed and with the incantations of the cowboys,
the stout walls, worm-eaten and bullet-splintered, falling gradually, blazed on.

"The jig's up here, boys," announced Van Horn, as the fire burned down. "The two biggest thieves
on the range are accounted for.  It's a good job.  If I guess right you'll find the Dutchman
in the fire.  Yankee Robinson's next.  He won't put up much of a fight, but the hardest man
to get is still ahead of us.  This was a boy's job beside rounding up Abe Hawk.  He'll never
be taken alive, because he knows what's comin' to him.

"There's not a minute to lose now.  Stone and I will take two of your men, Barb, and round
up Yankee Robinson.  From there we'll ride over to Abe's place on the Turkey.  About our only
chance is to catch him before he's up.  If he's got wind of this, we'll have a hell of a chase
to get him.  Feed the horses, the rest of you eat, and we're off!  You can follow us with Pettigrew
and the bunch, Doubleday, just as soon as you look the cabin over after daylight."  Within
half an hour Van Horn and Stone and the two men crossed the creek, rode into the hills and
disappeared into the night.

Setting a watch, Doubleday and his men curled up on the ground.  When earliest dawn streaked
the sky the logs were still smoking, and the cowboys, rifles in hand, walked down to where
the cabin had stood.

Everything within the walls had been consumed.  Long after daylight, with some of the men asleep,
and others waiting for the fire to cool, one of Doubleday's cowboys, poking about the sill
log of the rear wall with a stick, gave a shout.  What had been taken for a half-burned log
was the charred body of a man.  The invaders gathered and the body was presently declared by
those who knew him well to be that of Dutch Henry.  There was nothing more to detain the men
that were waiting. The cowboy worst wounded had started with a companion for home.  The Snipe
insisted on going on with Doubleday.

The horses had been left in good grass a little way down the creek. When they were disturbed
it was found that one was missing.  A hurried search failed to recover the horse.

While trackers were at work, the Snipe, always alert, found a clue that upset all calculations.
It was a small dark red spot soaked into the dust of the creek trail.  It was very small, such
as might have been made by a single drop of blood; but one such sign was enough to put on inquiry
a man versed like the Snipe in mountain craft.  Keeping his discovery to himself, he tracked
back and forth from his single spot, almost invisible in the dust, until he found a second
similar spot. This he marked, and dodging and circling, like a hound on a scent, the Snipe
ran his trail from his first tiny spot to the trees near the creek where the horses had been
left.  Doubling, he patiently tracked the telltale spots up the path that led to the cabin.
Then he called to Barb.

Doubleday, much out of temper, was in the saddle waiting to get started.  He bawled at the
Snipe, and not amiably.

"Keep cool," was the answer; "I'm 'a' comin'.  But look here before you start; there was two
men in that cabin, Barb."

"What are you givin' us?" blurted out a cowboy.  Doubleday stared ferociously.  "There was
two of 'em, boys," persisted the Snipe.

"You must 'a' seen double when you was runnin'," was the skeptical suggestion of another man.
But Doubleday listened.

The Snipe took him from the cabin down to the creek.  Then back to the cabin.  There he showed
him where someone had dug what might have been a hole under the sill log, near the door.

A horse was certainly missing.  Then, shells from two different rifles were picked out of the
ashes.  One size had been fired from a Winchester rifle; the others, much more numerous, belonged
to a Marlin.

"Who was it, Barney?" asked Doubleday, breathing heavily.  He was so wrought up and so hoarse
he could hardly frame the words.  But he was already convinced.

The Snipe shook his head.  "There's two or three fellows up here shoots a Marlin rifle.  If
I got one guess on this man that's made his get-away, Barb, I'd say----"  The Snipe poked further
into the ashes.

"Well, say!" thundered Doubleday.

"I'd say it was Abe Hawk."

CHAPTER XVII

VAN HORN TRAILS HAWK

A bomb exploding in the smoking remnants could hardly have caused more consternation among
the man hunters than the Snipe's naming of Abe Hawk.  But however Doubleday's jaw set at the
unwelcome surprise he was not the one to swerve in the face of any personal danger, and those
with him were not men to bolt whatever adventure they embarked in. However, it was remarked
by the Snipe that those least acquainted with Abe were least disturbed by the news of his almost
certain presence in the cabin the day and night before and his escape after the fight.

Common prudence made it necessary to cross the small divide with care and to get word of the
unpleasant discovery as soon as possible to Van Horn in order that he and his companions might
not be picked off by the wounded man from ambush.  The Snipe was assigned to Hawk's trail and
two men were sent to the wings to scout for him among the rocks. Bradley rode to warn Van Horn;
but the old man did not sweat his horse in the effort.

The trackers soon made it plain to those behind that the escaping man had ridden a pretty straight
course himself, and had picked his way in the night like one thoroughly at home in the hills
of the Turkey.  And though losing the trail at times, the Snipe had no serious trouble in picking
it again from the grass or the rocks.

The country lying north of the forks of the Turkey is rougher than to the south and pretty
well covered with pine.  On the Northern slope, Hawk's trail led down a long and winding break
mile after mile and in the end pointed straight for his shack on the creek.

Moving as nearly as possible in the order in which they had started, the party emerged from
the hills half a mile from the creek, and not much farther from Hawk's, when they encountered
Bradley and Van Horn with one of his men.  Doubleday hoarsely asked for the news.

Van Horn rode up close before he answered, and, though his tone was confident, his manner showed
his annoyance at the way things had turned: "Robinson's shack was empty," he said.  "Whether
he got wind of yesterday I don't know; anyway, he's skipped--there's nothing left on his place."

"What's there to this talk of Barney's about Abe Hawk?" demanded Doubleday.

"From what Bradley says, it looks as if he might be right," said Van Horn.  "The horse Hawk
took is eating grass in front of his cabin; we saw him when we got here and waited for Hawk
to show himself."

"He didn't do it," interrupted Doubleday huskily and baring his teeth as he spoke.

"Stone's watching the place."

"Is Abe there?" demanded Doubleday.

"You tell," responded Van Horn.  "He may or may not be.  That horse may be a stall.  We've
got to close in somehow on the shack and find out."

A cowboy clattered up from the creek and pulled his horse to its haunches between Doubleday
and Van Horn: "He's just closed the door," declared the cowboy.  "The door was open when we
got here--wasn't it, Harry?"  He pointed his finger at Van Horn in his excited appeal.

Van Horn scowled and waved his head from side to side in irritation: "The door was open, yes;
the door is shut, yes."  Then he swore at the alarmist: "You blamed monkey," he pointed to
the cottonwood.  "Don't you see how the wind is blowing?  That door has been swinging half
an hour.  The shack is empty."

But nobody could be found with confidence enough in Van Horn's belief to close in and demonstrate
its truth.  After a litany of hard words in which everybody took more or less part, Van Horn
declared he would demonstrate.  Whatever his faults, he was dead game, a formidable antagonist
in an encounter.  He was risking his life on his belief that either Hawk was disabled, or the
cabin was empty.  Stripping himself to shirt and trousers, turning his effects over to a cowboy,
bare-headed and with only a six-shooter in hand, he shook out his long, brown hair, hooked
up his belt and started to crawl up a little wash breaking into the creek not far from the cabin.

There was no point from which he could be seen and his companions, secreted where they could
watch, bent their eyes along the course of the wash up which their hidden leader was making
his way.

Fortunately for the slippery undertaking, Van Horn, by a little digging as he made his way
carefully ahead, was able to crawl to within fifty feet of the door without exposing himself
to fire.  Reaching the nearest spot he could attain with safety, he called in stentorian tones
to the cabin:

"You're surrounded, Abe.  You can't get away.  If you want to surrender, I'll guarantee your
life.  Come out unarmed and I'll meet you unarmed.  If not, it's what Gorman and Dutch Henry
got, for you, Abe."

The cabin gave no answer back.  But Van Horn would not be baffled. Knowing it would be suicide
to venture closer he patiently sought his answer on the ground he now began to cover on his
way back to the creek.  And on the ground he found it.

"He's slipped us," Van Horn called out when Doubleday arrived, "but I've got his trail."

"Two hundred and fifty dollars to the man that gets him!" shouted Doubleday, huskily.  Some
of the boys gave a whoop and began to look around, but they did not scatter much.

Van Horn, losing no time, led Doubleday part way up the break along which he had crawled. 
Telltale traces of blood at irregular intervals, sometimes imprinted as if by a hand on the
flat face of rock that bedded the wash; sometimes smeared on a starving bunch of grass, where
it clung desperately to a crevice in the scant soil--all so slight and so well concealed that
only the mere chance of Van Horn's crawling up the very break chosen by Hawk for his escape
to the creek had revealed it to his pursuers.  The tracker took the slender trail, followed
the wounded rustler to the creek bottom and thence down the creek to its junction with the
North Fork.  There they lost the trail in a pool of water, nor could they pick it up again.

A mile below the fork of the Turkey stood Jim Laramie's cabin.  The raiders had already entered
on his land; his cattle and some of his horses were, in fact, grazing in and about the creek
fork.  The following of Hawk's trail had been a nerve-racking job.  Hawk, his enemies knew,
might be waiting at any turn in it and that meant, in all probability, death for someone. 
In consequence, the pioneering fell chiefly on Van Horn; even Stone showed little stomach for
the job.  But the trail was completely lost.

"There's a bunch of horses grazing at the fork," reported Van Horn, as Doubleday reached the
front, "Laramie's, I guess--anyway, the trail's gone."

A council was held.  Doubleday, long-headed and crafty, listened to all that was said.  Van
Horn finally asked for his opinion.

"I don't know no more than the rest of you; but a blind man can figure a few things out.  He's
hit, ain't he?"  Barb put the question as one not to be gainsaid and found none to say him
nay.  "He's looking for help, that's more'n likely, ain't it?  He's a mile from Jim Laramie's
cabin, not more; he's three miles from anybody else's--what?" he exclaimed, as Bill Bradley
interrupted to suggest that it was less than two miles over to Ben Simeral's.  "All right,"
shouted Barb, "Hawk's here, ain't he?  He's close to Laramie.  Laramie's his friend.  Where
would he go--what?"

Chopping his ideas out as with an ax, Doubleday showed his companions what they should have
thought of without being told.  "The thing to do," he added, "is to go down to Laramie's cabin
and see what we can see--and find out what we can find out."

It was precisely what Bradley had feared would happen, but there was no escape from Doubleday's
logic and no help for what others as well as Bradley feared might follow.

CHAPTER XVIII

HAWK QUARRELS WITH LARAMIE

On the morning the raiders entered the Falling Wall, Laramie had started with Henry Sawdy for
the Reservation to appraise some allotted Indian lands.  Laramie rode home that night; Sawdy,
promising to stop at the ranch on his way down in the morning, stayed overnight at the Fort
with Colonel Pearson.  Laramie got home late.  He was asleep next morning when a door was pushed
open and a man walked unceremoniously in on him.  To what instinct some mountain men owe their
composure when disturbed in their sleep by a friend, as contrasted with the instant defense
they offer in like circumstances to an enemy, it would be difficult to say--certainly there
is a difference.

Laramie half opened his eyes to realize that Abe Hawk had come into his room and seated himself
on the one chair.  The sleepy man was not inclined to wake up.  "You're early, Abe," was his
only greeting.  Hawk made no answer.

After a further effort the drowsy man roused himself to the attention that seemed demanded
in the case: "Going somewhere?" he mumbled perfunctorily.

"Yes."  Hawk's hard tone might have surprised his host for a moment; but if it did, drowsiness
overpowered his senses once more and it was some time before he realized that his visitor was
sitting silent at his side and that he himself ought to say something.  In protest he shifted
his comfortable position in bed: "Get your breakfast ready, Abe," he suggested, hospitably,
but with his heavy eyes closed.

"I've had breakfast."

"Where you bound for today?"

"On a long trip."

"Which way?"

"Home."

"What do you mean, 'home'?"

"I mean hell, Larrie--the home long waiting for me."

Laramie's eyes batted slowly.  Not a half a dozen times in all their long acquaintance had
Hawk shortened Laramie's name in speaking to him; and then only when he spoke as he rarely
did from a depth always hidden from the men among whom his wasted life had been spent.  Roused
by something in the utterance of his guest, Laramie looked up.

If the sight was a shock, the mountain man gave no outward sign of it. The lower right side
of Hawk's face had been torn away as if by some explosion, and blood, darkened by clay and
rude styptics, clotted the long beard that naturally fell in a glossy black.  His disordered
garments, blood-smeared and hanging loose--his coat sleeve and his shirt torn from his forearm
for bandages, his soft hat jammed low over his eyes--for an instant, Laramie hardly recognized
him.  But the cold black eyes that looked out of the wreck of a man before him pierced so clearly
the long shadows of the early light that Laramie had no choice but to realize it was Hawk and
even the shock only served to restrain and steady him.  He showed but little of his amazement
when he sat up and spoke quietly: "What's up, Abe?"

"Night before last I was playing cards with Gorman over at Henry's. After daylight Gorman went
out for a bucket of water.  We heard a rifle crack.  I looked out the window.  Stormy was tumbling.

"You know the draw that runs down past his corral?  Barb Doubleday, Pettigrew, Van Horn, Stone
and a bunch of cowboys and Texas men lay in that draw.  It was hell to pay from daylight till
dark.  The Dutchman got laid out cold right at the start.  They tried to rush me.  I stopped
three of 'em and dug myself in.  We went at it hammer and tongs.  In the afternoon they put
a hole through my whiskers.  After awhile they clipped my shoulder.  Then I got a bullet through
my arm." He held up his left forearm swathed in a mass of soiled and blood-soaked bandages.
And he told of Van Horn's go-devil.

"The raid's on," muttered Laramie.

"Soon as it was dark, I began to dig under the sill," Hawk went on. "They began lighting fires.
I knew they couldn't keep those going a great while.  About ten o'clock I crawled out under
the front sill and got to the creek; I never was so gone for water in my life.  I set a candle
so it would fire the shack when it burned down and sneaked a horse from their bunch and got
over to my place."  He looked at his arm.  "I tried to keep things bound up.  Maybe I left
a little red behind me.  If I did, they'll be after me."

His story haltingly told; his utterance through his torn cheek thick and painful but savagely
uncompromising; carrying a physical burden of wounds that would have overwhelmed a lesser man
but with a deadly hate showing in his manner, Hawk, from sheer weakness, paused: "I went to
my cabin to look for more cartridges," he added slowly, "and not a one was there left on the
place."  He hesitated again.  "I didn't want to come here----"

Laramie sprang to his feet: "Where the hell else would you go?"

Hawk heard unmoved the rough assurance; perhaps his eyes flashed, for Laramie's voice rang
strong and true.  He already had his hand on Hawk's chair: "Come over here to the light," he
said, "till we get some of this dirt off you.  You need a bath, Abe.  For a clean man you look
like----"

Hawk put up his right hand: "I'll do for all the job that's left ahead of me."

"What job's left ahead of you?"

"You've got a rifle like mine, Jim; the Marlin you don't use."

"Well?"

"I come to see if you'd lend it to me again."

"Why not?"

"Got any shells for it?" snapped Hawk.

"I guess so."

"I left the horse at the cabin to stand 'em off awhile.  They'll lose a little time there.
They'll come down the creek--can't come any other way.  I'm going to wait for 'em in the timber."

"What for?"

"I'll finish with Doubleday and Van Horn, anyhow.  Maybe I can with Stone."

"And they'll finish with you."

"After I get them three the rest are welcome to what's left of me. I've got to be moving."

"Hold on a minute, Abe."  Laramie sat down on the side of his cot, his knees spread apart,
his elbows resting on them, and his hands clasped as he leaned forward, head down, to think.

"Them fellows are riding every minute," Hawk reminded him grimly.

"Let's talk this thing over," persisted Laramie.

"I'll pay you for your rifle right now," mumbled Hawk, feeling with his right hand in his trousers
pocket for some gold pieces.

"Don't talk monkey stuff, Abe."

"Then don't make a monkey out of me," snapped Hawk.  "Give me your rifle and let me go!"

"After we've talked it over."

Hawk pulled himself up out of the chair.  "You blamed fool," he said brokenly.  "Don't you
know that bunch will track me to your door and smash us with lead or burn us up in this shack
if they get here first? Give me the rifle," he thundered, "or I'll go into the timber with
this six-shooter.  What do you mean?  Are you going to turn yellow on me because I'm a thief?"

Laramie moved neither hand nor foot: "You're an older man than I am, Abe," he replied, without
even looking up.  "I can take words from you, I'd hate to take from anybody else--you know
that; and you know why. You won't talk; all right.  Now I'll tell you where you get off; you're
not going down to the timber--not a blamed step," he added deliberately.  "Finger your six-shooter
as much as you like."  Laramie waved his hand with his words.  "Use it on me if you like. 
But, by ----, Abe----"  As his voice changed, he jumped to his feet, adding like lightning,
"you're not going to use it on yourself!"

He sprang for Hawk, reaching with his left hand for the gun.  In tigerish ferocity the two
men came together.  Sleepy Cat worthies had sometimes speculated on what might happen if the
two men most known and most feared in the Falling Wall country, Hawk and Laramie, should ever
quarrel.  They met now; but in a quarrel the wildest gossip had not fancied.  Reeling, feet
slipping, knees and hands locking, eyes staring, no word spoken and breathing hard, the two
struggled in the middle of the cooped-up room--Hawk striving to free and kill himself; Laramie
determined to wrest the gun from his grasp.

It was an unequal contest.  Weakened by loss of blood, Hawk was not long a match for the only
man on the range who under other conditions could have stood up before him.  Gradually, with
the gun in his right hand, Hawk was bent backward, with Laramie's left hand slipping along
the barrel closer and closer to the grip.  Prolonged by the fear of further injuring the wounded
man, the tempestuous effort for mastery ended when Hawk was forced to the bed and Laramie's
iron fingers, closing on the gun, wrenched it from him.

Hawk was done out and Laramie without more resistance straightened him out on the bed.

"You're worse hit than you think," panted the conqueror.  "I've got a scheme better than yours,
if there's time to put it through.  Wait till I get a couple of horses."

The clatter of a horse outside cut into his last words.  Laramie instantly slipped Hawk's revolver
back into his hand, picked up his own gun and holster, strapping it to his waist as he ran,
crossed the room, tore up a board in the floor, snatched a pair of rifles from their cache
and hastening back to Hawk, his eyes glued all the while to the door, pushed one rifle into
Hawk's hand and swung the other to his hip.

Not a word had been spoken.  But preparations for a reception had been made complete and eventualities
thoroughly considered.  Heavy footfalls outside announced the approach of a man.  The next
moment the door was flung open and the intruder heard Laramie's voice in savage emphasis:

"Pitch up!"

The intruder did not, however, pitch up.  It was John Lefever.  He stood amazed.  "For the
love of God," he exclaimed, "what's broke loose?"

"Come in, John," cried Laramie, seizing his arm.  "I want your horse a minute.  Stay here till
I get back--come, Abe, lively!"

"Where you going?" demanded Lefever, staring as he tried to collect his wits.

Laramie hurried Hawk past him: "That'll depend on the shooting, John," was all Laramie hastily
said.  "Doubleday and Van Horn have got a bunch of Texas men raiding the Falling Wall."

Lefever, gazing stunned at Hawk, talked as if he saw nothing.  "I know all about that," he
cried.  "Man alive, that's what I'm here for.  Hold on, can't you?"

"Not now.  Stick around till I get back."

Lefever caught his breath in time to fire one more question:

"What about Abe?"

"He's not coming back.  Scout around down along the creek, John, so you can see those fellows
when they ride in.  Hold 'em as long as you can and for God's sake keep 'em out of this cabin--there's
blood on everything."

CHAPTER XIX

LEFEVER RECEIVES THE RAIDERS

Laramie knew Lefever to be quite equal to the highly particular job he had assigned to him
and that John would give his best to it.  Hardly thirty minutes later, the raiders rode out
of the timber along the creek.  Van Horn stopped his pack for a word of warning:

"Look to your guns," he said harshly.  "You can guess most o' you what you'll be up against,
if there's trouble at this joint."  Leaving the creek, the party rode out on a rarely used
trail that, Stone told them, led to Laramie's cabin.  They followed this for some distance,
keeping two men ahead as they had done in the early morning.  These two men, reaching the bench,
which at that point had been cut sharply away by a flood, halted.  The main party riding up
the hill debouched on level ground at the crest and joined their scouts.  Half a mile to their
right stood Laramie's cabin.  The bench land lying in front of it was as smooth as a table
and covered with mountain blue stem.  Out of the level ground, a hundred yards from the edge
of the bench where Doubleday's party had halted, rose a huge and solitary fragment of rock.

Beside this rock stood a large man facing the intruders; slung over his left forearm he carried
a rifle and his right hand he held well out toward them with its open palm raised in the air.
The raiders understood the signal; it warned them to advance no farther.

"What's that fat buck doing up in this country?" asked Van Horn, angrily.

"Who is it?" demanded Doubleday.

"John Lefever," returned Van Horn, greatly nettled.  "What are you doing here?" he bellowed
at the unwelcome sentinel.

John pointed a stubby forefinger at Van Horn and returned a perfectly intelligible retort:
"That's not the first question, Harry; that's the second question," he yelled.  "What are you
doing here?"

This was not in all respects a question easy to answer.  But Van Horn was resourceful: "We're
on our way down the creek, John.  Rode up from the bottom to see Jim Laramie a minute."

"Just a friendly call," assented John.  "Well, how about sidearms," he shouted, "and how many
of you are there?"

Van Horn looked around him: "Why, maybe a dozen, I reckon, John.  You know most everybody here."

"How many of you are there want to see Jim a minute, Harry?" asked Lefever, calm but conveniently
close to the rock and quite conscious of the delicacy of his position should shooting begin.

There was some exchange of talk before the question was answered: "Look here, Lefever," roared
Doubleday huskily; "what the hell's all this fuss about?"

"Why, it's like this, Barb," returned Lefever, nothing abashed.  "When I seen you crossing
down there at the forks I thought maybe you'd lost your Bibles in the creek.  That's the way
you acted.  But when I seen you and Harry Van Horn and Tom Stone loading your rifles in the
timber, I reckoned you must be comin' up to ask Jim to run for sheriff on the cattle ticket."

Sarcasm could hardly convey more defiance and contempt.  The riders realized they had been
watched and that deception was useless; Van Horn was furiously angry.  "Look here, Lefever,"
he called out, short and sharp.

"I'm looking right there, Harry," yelled Lefever irreverently.  "With a bunch of mugs like
that on the horizon I sure wouldn't dare look anywhere else!"

"These boys won't stand any more fooling," roared Doubleday.

"I wouldn't either, Barb, if you'd got me into this scrape as deep as you've got them," was
the retort.

Nothing less than violent outbursts of profanity served now.  And these proceeding to a climax
of strength and rapidity, gradually subsided as such outbursts do and the two sides started
to argue all over again.

After much parley and protestations of peaceful intent, provided they were treated fair, Doubleday
and Van Horn were allowed to ride up to the rock, but not to dismount.  "Now," suggested Lefever
to the two, "talk just plain business."

"Right you have it, John," returned Van Horn briskly.  "The rustlers have got to go.  We're
looking for Abe Hawk.  Gorman and Dutch Henry are lifting cattle now in the Happy Hunting Grounds.
We're going to clean out the rest of 'em.  We've tracked Abe here.  Without any hard words,
we want him."

"Then, boys, you want to ride right on; keep on riding, for he's not here.  I don't know anything,
but that much I do know," asserted the big fellow positively.

"How do you know?" demanded Doubleday grimly.

"I just walked down here from the cabin; there's no one there.  I rode in here this morning
from the Reservation, Barb.  A buck looking for horses over on the North Fork yesterday saw
the fight at Gorman's--everybody knows about it."

Van Horn showed his teeth: "You're a pretty good artist, John, with your buck looking for horses."

Lefever deprecated the compliment: "You must remember, Harry, I worked seven year for you.
Seven year--and then didn't get all was coming to me."

"If you had," returned Van Horn candidly, "your headstone would be covered with moss by this
time, John.  Where's Laramie?"

Lefever stood with his left hand eagerly extended and appeared as if sensitive at Van Horn's
incredulity:

"All the same, Harry," he exclaimed, "I can take you to that buck inside two hours' ride and
get his story.  I've got five twenty-dollar gold pieces in my pocket that says so.  I'll put
'em up in Barb Doubleday's hands right now against your five."

"A man couldn't pry you loose from five twenty-dollar gold pieces if you had five thousand
in your pocket, John.  What are you stalling around for?" demanded Van Horn suspiciously. 
"Where's Laramie?"

Lefever was frankness itself; almost over-frank in his genuine simplicity.  Had it not been
for his big, blunt eyes and round, smooth face he might have been suspected of duplicity--but
not by the two men now talking to him; they knew beyond a doubt that John was "stringing" them.
Unfortunately they could not prevent it.  He answered Van Horn's sharp question as innocently
as a child.

"That's more than I can say this minute, Harry, where Jim Laramie is; but he's not far, I can
tell you that, for the coffee pot was on the stove when I got to the shack a while ago."

"Then what are you holding us up here for?" barked Doubleday with rough words.

"I'm a peace officer, Barb, a deputy marshal."  The bursting expression of disgust on his questioners'
faces did not ruffle John's candor.  "I know what you fellows are up to.  I won't have any
bloodshed here this morning--that's flat.  Laramie gets hot sometimes and this is one of the
times for folks to go slow.  If you want to talk to Laramie come along up to the shack.  But
send them longhorns over there down to the creek," he added, as an afterthought and in the
bluntly candid tone of appeal that distinguished his persuasiveness.

"Long hell!" spluttered Doubleday.

"Longhorns," persisted Lefever.

Barb growled at the proposal to send the boys down to the creek, and Van Horn objected, but
there was no escape from Lefever's stubbornness, except a fight and this was not wanted.  Lefever
passed his word that Hawk was not in the cabin, but he was adamant on sending the men to the
bottoms and his demand was grudgingly acceded to.  In point of fact, John reckoned himself
on foot with a rifle equal to two men on horseback, even if Van Horn were one.  But not being
able to take care of a dozen horsemen he was resolved to have no volleying applause from other
guns, if the unexpected should happen on the open bench land.

After Doubleday and Van Horn's following had at length filed down to the creek bottom, Lefever
walked beside the two horsemen toward the cabin, and, since he would not walk fast and the
two refused to ride ahead of him, the pace was deliberate all the way.  Nor could Lefever be
persuaded even to walk between the two horsemen; he kept them both religiously on his left,
his rifle lying carelessly across his forearm as he entertained them with a moderately timed
and unfailing flow of Reservation small talk.

But he could not control Van Horn's quick, flashing eyes, and these were busy every moment
and every foot of the way with reconnaissance and inference.  It did not escape either him
or Doubleday that a bunch of horses had been but lately driven over the ground they were crossing,
and every trail leading to and from the cabin obliterated; this, however, only assured both
that their man was close at hand and strengthened their determination to get him in their own
way when they were ready.  So intent were they on reading the ground as well as on keeping
a sharp eye on the cabin itself, that they had almost reached it before Van Horn, halting,
fixed his eyes on the hills to the left--that is, down the creek--and exclaimed sharply: "Who's
that?"

Riding in a leisurely fashion down and out of the rough country to the South, a mile away,
a man emerging from a rift between two hills could be seen following one of the cattle trails
toward the creek.

Lefever, after a minute's study, answered the question blandly: "I'm thinkin' that's Jim Laramie,
right now."

He waved his hat at the distant horseman, who, also rode with a rifle slung across his pommel
and carried his lines high in his right hand. The horseman continued for some moments toward
the creek, then looking, seemingly by accident, toward the house he saw the signaling, stopped
his pony, paused, and reigning him around, headed at an easy pace for the group before the
cabin.  It was, as Lefever had said, Laramie.

A few minutes later he trotted his horse across the field and slowed him up in front of Van
Horn and Doubleday.  His greeting to his visitors was dry; their own was somewhat strained,
but Lefever at once took the initiative: "Jim," he said, identifying himself in his bluntly
honest way with the interests of the raiders, "we're looking for Abe Hawk."

Laramie's response was merely to the point: "He's not here."

"Has he been here?" demanded Van Horn.

"Yes," answered Laramie.  Lefever at intervals looked virtuously from questioner to questioned.

"How long ago, Jim?" continued Van Horn.

Laramie regarded him steadily: "Several times in the last few weeks."

"Was he here yesterday?" asked Van Horn suddenly.

"I was on the Reservation yesterday."

"Has he been here this morning?"

"Yes."

If Lefever jumped inwardly at this most unexpected admission he suppressed all outward sign
of surprise; his wide open eyes did not blink and his close-cut mustache preserved its honesty
undefiled.  But he wondered what might be coming.

"How long ago?" continued Van Horn.

"Early.  What's all this questioning about?" Laramie demanded in turn, looking from Van Horn
to Doubleday and to Lefever.  "Who wants Hawk?"

"Jim, we're cleaning up the rustlers," said Van Horn.  "Things have got so bad it had to be
done.  We want Hawk.  We've got Gorman and Henry. Now, if it's a fair question, is Abe here?"

"He's not."

"Not in your shack?"

"No."

"Are you willing we should search it?"

"Search hell!  What do you mean?" asked Laramie curtly.  "Isn't my word good as to who's in
my shack?"

"Jim!"  Lefever held up a peacemaker's hand.  "We thought maybe he might have come in since
you rode away."

"Well----" Laramie cooled somewhat, "if it'll do you any good, I'll look inside and see."

Van Horn sarcastically demurred: "Don't take the trouble, don't take the trouble, Jim."

"Still he might be there," urged Lefever, "in the way I say--he might've walked in since you
went into the hills--what?  No objection to my looking in there, is there, Jim?"

"No man can search my cabin," snapped Laramie.  "Have you got a warrant for Abe Hawk?"  He
threw the question sharply at Lefever.

With Lefever's disclaimer, Doubleday interposed a savage rejoinder: "A rope'll fit Abe's neck
better than a warrant."

Laramie eyed the old cattleman unmoved: "And you're here to get me to help you slip the noose,
are you?"

"We're here to clean out these cattle thieves," stormed Doubleday.

"There are no cattle thieves here," retorted Laramie undisturbed. "You're wasting the time
you'll need on your job.  Move on!"

Even Van Horn was taken aback by the rude command; he pulled his horse around: "Look here,
Jim; let me talk to you a minute alone."

Laramie, guiding his horse with his heels, followed Van Horn twenty feet away and listened:
"Jim, I'm leading this bunch, and whatever troubles you've had with Barb and his friends, now's
the time to fix 'em up.  They'll give you the best of it.  If you've got any line on where
Hawk is, say so and it puts you with us; say nothing, and you're against us."

Laramie eyed him without a quiver: "I'm against you, Harry."

Van Horn did not give up.  He talked again, and talked hard.  It was useless.  Doubleday rode
over to where Van Horn held Laramie in deadly earnest conference.  Van Horn, ready to quit,
gladly let the older man take over the case.  But Doubleday made no better success.  Laramie
could not be moved.  If coaxed, he was obstinate; if threatened, impatient--contemptuous. 
Doubleday, when Laramie coldly refused even to answer his questions concerning Hawk, boiled over.

He moved his horse a step and opened his vials of wrath: "Laramie, you've turned down the last
chance decent folks on the range'll ever try to hand you--the last chance you'll ever see to
pull away from these Falling Wall thieves.  Now," he exclaimed, raising his right hand and
arm with a bitter imprecation, "we'll show you who's going to run the Sleepy Cat range.  I'll
drive you out of this country if it takes every cowboy I can hire and every dollar I've got.
This country won't hold you and me after today.  D'ye hear?" he shouted, almost bending with
his huge frame over Laramie and beside himself with rage.  Then spurring his horse, he wheeled
it around to rejoin Van Horn.

Even then Laramie was too quick for him.  Almost in the very instant, he jumped his own pony
after the angry man and gaining the head of Doubleday's horse, caught the bridle and jerked
the beast almost to its haunches.

It was a ticklish instant.  Van Horn, with his hand on his revolver, attempted to spur to Doubleday's
assistance.  Lefever interposed with a sharp move that put him plumply in front of Van Horn:
"Not till them two are through, Harry.  We stay right here till them two's done."

The very impudence of Laramie's move had taken Doubleday by surprise and Laramie was hurling
angry words at him before Lefever had intervened: "Hold on, Doubleday," Laramie said bluntly,
"you can't put your abuse all over me first and then run away with it.  You'll hear what I've
got to say.  I rode this range before you ever saw it; I'll ride this range when you're gone.
I was born here, Doubleday; my father lived here before me.  The air I breathe, this sky over
my head, this ground under my feet, are mine, and I stick here in spite of you and your cattle
crooks.  If men run off your cattle it's your sheriff's business--you own him.  And it's your
business to run 'em down--not mine.  You come here without a warrant, without a definite complaint,
and ask me to turn an old man over to a bunch of lynchers!  Not on your life.  Not today or
any other day."

Doubleday interrupted, but he was forced to listen: "You talk about thieves," Laramie spoke
fast and remorselessly, "and you belong to the bunch that's tried to steal every foot of land
I own in the Falling Wall.  After you and your lawyers and land office tools have stolen thousands
of acres from the government, you talk as if you were an angel out of heaven about the men
that brand your mavericks.  Hell!" The scorn of the expletive drew from the very depths of
furious contempt.  "I'd rather stand by a thief that calls himself a thief, than a thief that
steals under a lawyer.  Send your hired men after me; give 'em plenty of ammunition.  They'll
find me right here, Barb--right here where I live."

CHAPTER XX

THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE

When Sawdy rode into Sleepy Cat next morning it was known that he had come from the Reservation
and he was besieged for news from the Falling Wall.  At Kitchen's, where he put up his horse;
on his way up street to his room over McAlpin's pool hall, he was assailed with questions.
Pretty accurate reports of the two exciting days in the North country had already trickled
into Sleepy Cat.  To these, Sawdy listened with stolid attention but he managed to add to them
very little.  He possessed to a degree the faculty of talking freely, sententiously even, without
contributing anything strictly pertinent to a subject. What he conveyed, when he meant to withhold
information, was really no more than an air of reserve in which wisdom seemed discreetly restrained.
On this present occasion he realized it would be known that he had encountered the raiders
the day before at Laramie's--but while admitting this profusely, he minimized all else.

Not until he had bathed, slept, shaved and set himself down near nightfall at Belle Shockley's
did he tell any considerable part of his story.  But all that prudence would permit he told,
or rather, Belle demanded and received at his hands.  Where the heart is involved the strongest
men are helpless.

"I ran into the bunch on my way down, right at Laramie's cabin," Sawdy said to Belle.  "Laramie
and Doubleday were having the hottest kind of a row when I rode up.  I made sure we'd be shooting
in the next couple of minutes.  But John Lefever was watching pretty close and holding Van
Horn.  Barb cooled down when he saw three of us on deck.  I told him on the side, the Governor
had telephoned Pearson and the Colonel was going to send cavalry down after them and they'd
better scatter.  It was a bluff, but for a few minutes I had him and Van Horn guessing.  They
said they'd go home when they got Hawk.  Lefever is staying up there for a day or two."

"What did they do after that?" demanded Belle, referring to the men whose names were on everybody's
tongues.

"Beat the bushes from Laramie's to the Reservation," answered Sawdy. "Didn't leave a square
yard of country unturned from the Falling Wall to the Crazy Woman."

"Will they ever find Hawk?"

"Did you ever find a needle in a haystack?"

"I never looked for one."

"Them fellows are looking for the stack.  They can't locate the hay. Slip me that Worcestershire
sauce, Belle.  Yours truly.  No more potatoes.  This is a good piece of ham, Belle.  I wish
to God you'd serve a glass of beer with a man's supper."

"You can get all the supper and all the beer you want at the hotel," flared Belle.  "This is
no blind pig----"

"It's the only place in Main Street, then, that ain't."

"And it never will be," averred Belle, indignantly.

"Come up to the hotel with me right now," returned Sawdy coldly, "and I'll buy you a bottle
of beer.  Bet you ten dollars you da'ssent do it--who the devil--"  Sawdy almost choked as
the two heard a knock at the door--"who the devil is that?" he repeated.  The door opened and
Jim Laramie walked in.

He sent his hat sailing toward a side table, stepped forward and, catching at a chair on the
way, greeted Belle and her guest and sat down before a plate cover opposite Sawdy.  He pointed
to what remained of Sawdy's supper and, with knife and fork, started in: "There's enough for
me right here, Belle," he said.

Sawdy raised his chin: "Not this time, Jim.  Not on your life.  That's the way you always eat
my supper."

"You eat too much, Henry--it will kill you some time," observed Laramie, losing no time in
his initiative.  He ignored Sawdy's stare and the big man, disgusted, sat dumb: "Don't surrender,
Sawdy," counseled Laramie.  "Keep going, and excuse me if I seem to begin."

Sawdy paused, his knife and fork firmly in hand, but pointing helplessly into the air: "This
is the first square meal I've had for two days," he said, as one whose hopes have been dashed.

"First I've had for ten days," returned Laramie.

"What are they doing up there, Jim?" asked Sawdy peremptorily.

"Killing their horses."

"They won't find him," Sawdy predicted in words inaudible six feet away.

"I hope not."

"How's he holding out?"

"Hard hit, Henry."

"Will he make it?"

"You can't kill a cat."

"Well"--Sawdy resumed his supper, "it's your game, Jim, not mine; but I'd think twice before
I'd get that range bunch after me on any man's account."

Laramie's eyes flashed, but he spoke quietly: "I couldn't see Abe killed like a rattlesnake."

"What are you down for?"

"I've got to have a couple of needles, a little catgut and some gauze."

"Where are you going to get them?"

"Going to steal them over at Doc. Carpy's."

"Nervy."

"You can do it for me, Henry."

"Me?"

"I'll give you the key to his cabinet."

"Where'd you get that?"

"Met him on my way in.  He was going up to Pettigrew's to look after the wounded.  The window
in the end of the wing opens into the operating room, where the supplies are."

"I'd look fine climbing into a window at two hundred and twenty pounds."

"It's on the ground floor," returned Laramie, unmoved.

"What will the family be doing while I'm burgling?"

"Mrs. Carpy and the girls are in Medicine Bend.  The house is empty. When you're through, leave
the key in the skull of the skeleton behind the door."

Sawdy stared without much enthusiasm at the little key that Laramie passed to him; then he
slipped it without comment into his pocket.  The talk went on in low, leisurely tones until
the second portion of ham had been served, when both resumed their supper as if nothing had
been eaten or said.  Afterward, Laramie spent an hour getting together some things he needed
at home.  He met Sawdy later at Kitchen's barn. Sawdy, with abundance of grumbling at his assignment,
had the gauze and the catgut, but he had brought the key back.  He could not find the surgeon's
needles.  There seemed nothing for it but for Laramie to go to the office and make the search
himself.  He thought of Belle; she would do it for him, he knew, but he felt it would not be
right to mix her up in what might prove a still more tragic affair.  After brief reflection
he started for Carpy's himself.

The doctor's house stood back of Main Street, a block and a half from the barn.  Laramie walked
half a mile to reach it, choosing unlighted ways for the trip.  The night was dark and by crossing
a vacant lot he reached the rear of the house unobserved.  The office, divided into a consulting
room and an operating room, consisted of a one-story wing connecting with the residence--the
consulting room adjoining the residence, the operating room occupying the end of the wing.
This latter was the room Laramie sought.  The window that Sawdy had already burglariously entered,
opened easily, and Laramie, standing alone in the dark room, felt in his pocket for a match.

He had been in the office more than once before and knew about where the cabinet containing
the surgical instruments stood.  A connecting door led from the room he had entered to the
office proper.  He tried this.  It was unlocked and he left it closed.  The curtains of the
windows were drawn and he took a match from his pocket, lighted it and looked around.  The
first thing he saw was the articulated skeleton suspended near the door from the ceiling. 
It would have been a shock had he not seen it before and been familiar with the label fastened
to the breastbone reciting that this had once been Flat Nose George, an early day desperado
of the high country.

Turning from this relic, Laramie set about his work, disdaining to inspect various gruesome
specimens in alcohol ranged along a shelf. Aided by an occasional match which he lighted and
shielded in his left hand, he found the cabinet and with his key opened the door.  The flame
of his match too carefully guarded, flickered in his fingers, failed and went out.  He thrust
it hastily into one pocket, drew a fresh match from another and was about to scratch it across
his leather wristlet when he heard a door open.  The next moment he saw, under the door leading
from his room to the consulting room, a flash of light.

Awkward as it was to be interrupted, he faced the surprise with such composure as he could
muster.  Who could it be? he asked himself.  The family was accounted for, the house locked.
He scratched the match again.  As it flared up he looked into the cabinet, found the packet
of needles, tore a card of them in two, slipped one piece into a waistcoat pocket and closed
the cabinet door.  He turned to listen to the office intruder.  Laramie hoped that nothing
would bring the unwelcome visitor into the operating room, but as he stood awaiting developments
the unlocked door was pushed open and a tiny flashlight was thrown into the room in which he stood.

Fortunately Laramie outside the circle of light was left in the dark. The intruder was a woman.
He shrank back and she luckily turned her light from him but only to encounter, as she stepped
forward, Flat Nose George, no less forbidding now than he had been in life.  The woman with
the light started back in horror and a sharp little exclamation betrayed her identity; Laramie
was at once aware that he was facing Kate Doubleday.

Nothing could have pleased him less.  In so small a room it was impossible to escape detection.
He could almost hear her breathe and would have reveled in her presence so close, but that
the apprehension of frightening her weighed on him like a mountain.  Hardly daring to breathe
himself he cursed the erratic doctor's skeleton pet--hung, of all places, where every little
while he was cutting people open.

The skeleton had already set the girl's nerves on edge.  What would happen if she discovered
a live man as well as the ghastly remains of a dead one--not to mention alcoholic clippings
from other subnormal notables of the mountains?  With the flashlight she was evidently searching
for something and Laramie surmised it must be the electric light switch: "I think," he suggested
in as steady a tone as possible, "you'll find the light button to the right of the door behind
you."

He was prepared for a scream or a swoon.  Instead, the flashlight was turned directly on him:
"Who are you?" came sharply and quickly from behind it.

"I might ask the same question.  You can see I'm Jim Laramie.  I can guess you're Kate Doubleday."

"I am, and I've come here for dressings for wounded men at Pettigrew's. What are you doing
here?" she demanded, peremptorily.

His lips were sealed for more reasons than one.  Least of all would it do for him to expose
Doctor Carpy's friendliness and embroil him in a feud which Laramie knew he ought to face alone.

Kate held the light excitedly on him.  It was an instant before he had his answer in hand:
"I've lied to a good many people at different times about different things," he said deliberately.
"I've still got my first lie to tell to you, Kate.  And I certainly won't tell it tonight.
Don't ask me what I'm doing here.  Turn on the light by the door, or let me do it, so I can
see you.  You here alone?"

"No, there are plenty of men outside with me," she exclaimed abruptly.

"I shouldn't have asked that question," he continued in the same tone. "I know you're alone.
You say 'men' because you're afraid of me----"

"I'm not the least afraid of you.  And don't deceive yourself.  There are men here."

"But they are mostly in bottles, Kate--and in pieces.  Live men don't ride up to a place like
this without making a noise.  Flat Nose George is the only man here besides me, outside the
alcohol, and I can claim him as well as you can."

"I'm sure you would feel perfectly at home with Flat Nose George," she retorted swiftly.

If the words stung, Laramie kept his temper.  "Probably there's a good deal I deserve that
you haven't heard about me," he said slowly.  "But from the way you talk, you've heard a few
things maybe I don't deserve. Nobody's got any right to class me with Flat Nose George or anybody
else in Carpy's museum."

"You've classed yourself with him," she exclaimed vehemently. "Defending cattle thieves and
harboring them!  Everyone knows that!"

"I did talk rough to your father this morning.  I was pretty angry. Just the same, don't believe
everything you hear about me.  At present, it's just us two.  What do you want to do, surrender
to me?"

"No!" she snapped the word out furiously.  "I won't, not if you kill me."

"Suppose I surrender to you?  What do you want me to do--stick up my hands?  So far, they haven't
been up--if I remember right.  But I expect I'll have to learn sometime how to surrender."

"I want no surrender, no parley with you.  The doctor told me his house was empty and directed
me here for the dressings.  When I come, I find you.  I'll get away at once.  Before I go----"

"No, I'll go.  But let me turn on the light."  He stepped to the door and pressed the button.
"I wanted," he continued, as a light flooded the queer room, "to have just one look at you
before I go."  She stood before him quite unafraid.  Her eyes flashed as if she were actually
mistress of the situation instead of really helpless in the presence of her father's most resourceful
enemy.

Laramie half-smiled at her serenity: "Why don't you go?" she exclaimed.

Still regarding her, he shifted his position a little and replied with entire good-nature:
"I only live along, from one sight to another of you.  I'm just filling up, like a man at a
spring.  You don't object to my only looking at you for a minute?"

"I object to being delayed and annoyed," she declared in a blaze. "I've come here for dressings
needed for wounded men----"

"Well, so have I, if you must have it."

"I was sent here by Doctor Carpy for things he wants tonight; you have no more right here helping
yourself to his property than you have taking other people's."

"Don't say I take other people's property!" Laramie spoke fiercely. "Don't call me a thief."
His words burned with anger.  "My hands may not be as white as yours--they're just as clean!"

Stunned as she might well have been at the outburst, Kate stood her ground: "Did Doctor Carpy
give you permission to come here tonight?" She shot the words at Laramie without giving him
time to breathe.

Laramie checked the flood of anger he had loosed: "I don't need permission from Doctor Carpy
to come here night or day.  Ask him if you want to," he said with scornful disgust.  He sank
down on the chair at his side in complete resentment of the whole situation and, leaning forward
with a hand spread over one knee and one fist clenched on the other, he stared not at Kate's
eyes, but at the floor, with only her trim boots in his field of vision.  "What's the use?"
he exclaimed, drawing the words up seemingly all the way from his own disorderly and alkali-stained
foot coverings.  "What's the use?" he repeated, in stronger and more savage tones.  "I've treated
her from the first instant I saw her, and every instant since, as I thought a woman ought to
be treated--would like to be treated.  Now I get my reward.  She calls me a thief--and, my
God!  I take it.  I don't ride out and kill her father who taught her to do it, quick as I
can reach him; I just take it!" he exclaimed.

He hesitated a moment.  Then he flung a question at her like a thunderbolt: "What do you want
here?"

She was frightened.  His rage was plain enough; who could tell the lengths to which it might
carry him?

She kept her dignity but she answered and without quibbling: "I want some gauze and some cotton
and some medicines."

He strode to the cabinet and, concealing the movement as he unlocked it with Carpy's key, he
threw open the glass door: "You'd be all night finding the stuff," he said curtly, taking the
supplies from various cluttered piles on different shelves.  "You say he wants this tonight,"
he added, when her packet was complete: "How are you going to get it to him?"

"Carry it to him."

"At Pettigrew's?  What do you mean?  It would take an experienced horseman all night to ride
around by Black Creek."

"I'm going over the pass."

He could not conceal his anger: "Does your father know that?"

"He said I might try it."

Laramie flamed again: "A fine father to send a tenderfoot girl on a night ride into a country
like that!"

She was defiant: "I can ride anywhere a man can."

"Let me tell you," he faced her and his eyes flashed, "if you try riding 'anywhere' too often,
some night your father's daughter will fail to get home!"

Ignoring the door, he stepped to the open window by which he had entered and, springing through
it, was gone.

CHAPTER XXI

THE HIDING PLACE

Disdaining any further attempt at concealment, Laramie rode angrily over to Kitchen's barn;
anyone that wanted a dispute with him just then could have it, and promptly.  Kitchen got up
his horse and, cutting short the liveryman's attempt to talk, Laramie headed for home.

The sky was studded with a glory of stars.  He rode fast, his fever of anger acting as a spur
to his anxiety, which was to get back to dress Hawk's wounds.

His thoughts raced with the hoofs of his horse.  Nothing could have galled and humiliated him
more than to realize how Kate Doubleday regarded him.  Plainly she looked on him as no better
than one of the ordinary rustlers of the Falling Wall country.  This was distressingly clear;
yet he knew in his own heart that hers was the only opinion among her people that he cared
anything about.  Furious waves of resentment alternated with the realization that such an issue
was inevitable--how could it be otherwise?  She had heard the loose talk of men about her--Stone,
alone, to reckon no other, could be depended on to lie freely about him.  Van Horn, he was
as sure, would not scruple to blacken an enemy; and added to Laramie's discomfiture was the
reflection that this man whose attentions to Kate he most dreaded, held her ear against him
and could, if need be, poison the wells.

To these could be added, as his implacable enemy, her own father.  This last affair had cut
off every hope of getting on with the men for whom he had no respect and who for one reason
or another hated him as heartily as he hated them.

Under such a load of entanglement lay the thought of Kate.  What utter foolishness even to
think of her as he let himself think and hope! Clattering along, he told himself nothing could
ever come of it but bitterness; and he cast the thought and hope of knowing her better and
better until he could make her his own, completely out of his heart.

The only trouble was that neither she, nor the bitterness would stay out.  As often as he put
them out they came in again.  The first few miles of his road were the same that she would
soon be riding after him.  Again and again he felt anger at the idea of her riding the worst
of the Falling Wall trail at night to Pettigrew's.  More than once he felt the impulse to wait
for her, and even slackened his pace.

But when he did so, there arose before him her picture as she flung the hateful words at him;
they came back as keenly as if he heard them again and he could feel his cheeks burning in
the cold night air. Self-respect, if nothing else, would prevent his even speaking another
word to her that night.  His hatred of her father swelled in the thought that he should let
her attempt such a ride.

For several miles beyond where he knew Kate must turn for the pass, Laramie rode on toward
home; then watching his landmarks carefully he reined his horse directly to the left and headed
for the broken country lying between the Turkey and the mountains.  At some little distance
from the trail, he stopped and sitting immovable in his saddle, listened to ascertain whether
he was followed.  For almost thirty minutes--and that is a long time--he waited, buried in
the silence of the night and without the slightest impatience.  He heard in the distance the
coyotes and the owls but no horseman passed nor did the sound of hoofs come within hearing.
Then reining his pony's head again toward the black heights of the Lodge Pole range he continued
his journey.

Soon all semblance of any trail was left behind and he rode of necessity more slowly.  More
than once he halted, seemingly to reassure himself as to his bearings for he was pushing his
way where few men would care to ride even in daylight.  He was feeling across precipitous gashes
and along treacherous ledges esteemed by Bighorn but feared by horse and man; and among huge
masses of rocky fragments that had crashed from dizzy heights above before finding a resting
place.  And even then they had been heaved and tumbled about by the fury of mountain storms.

Laramie was, in fact, nearing the place--by the least passable of all approaches--where he
had hidden Hawk.  Yet he did not hesitate either to stop or to listen or to double on his trail
more than once. Maneuvering in this manner for a long time he emerged on a small opening, turned
almost squarely about and rode half a mile. Dismounting at this point and lifting his rifle
from its scabbard he slung his bag over his shoulder and walked rapidly forward.

The hiding place had been well chosen.  On a high plateau of the Falling Wall country, so broken
as to forbid all chance travel and to be secure from accidental intrusion--a breeding place
for grizzlies and mountain lions--there had once been opened a considerable silver mining camp.
Substantial sums had been spent in development and from an old Turkey Creek trail a road had
been blasted and dug across the open country divided by the canyon of the Falling Wall river.
In its escape from the mountains the river at this point cuts a deep gash through a rock barrier
and from this striking formation, known as the canyon of the Falling Wall, the river takes
its name.

Where the old mine road crosses the plateau an ambitious bridge, as Laramie once told Kate,
had been projected across the river.  It was designed to replace a ferry at the bottom of the
canyon but with the ruinous decline in the value of silver the mines had been abandoned; a
weather-beaten abutment at the top of the south canyon wall alone remained to recall the story.
The earth and rock fill behind this abutment had been washed out by storms leaving the framing
timbers above it intact, and below these there remained a cave-like space which the slowly
decaying supports served to roof.

Laramie on a hunting trip had once discovered this retreat and had at times used it as a shelter
when caught over night in its vicinity. During subsequent visits he found an overhang in the
rock behind the original fill that made a second smaller chamber and in this he had as a boy
cached his mink and rat traps and the discard of his hunting equipment.

To the later people coming into the Falling Wall country with cattle the existence of all this
was practically unknown.  Nothing visible betrayed the retreat and to men who rarely left the
saddle and had little occasion to cross the bad lands, there was slight chance to stumble on
it.  It was here, a few miles west of his own home, that Laramie had carried Hawk.

Making his way in the darkness toward the dugout, Laramie whistled low and clearly, and planting
his feet with care on a foothold of old masonry swung down to where a fissure opening in the
rock afforded entrance into the irregular room.

A single word came in a low tone from the darkness: "Jim?"

Laramie, answering, struck a match and, after a little groping, lighted a candle and set it
in a niche near where Hawk lay.  The rustler was stretched on a rude bunk.  The furnishings
of the cave-like refuge were the scantiest.  Between uprights supporting the old roof, a plank
against the wall served as a narrow table; the bunk had been built into the opposite wall out
of planking left by the bridge carpenters.  For the rest there was little more in the place
than the few belongings of a hunter's lodge long deserted.  A quilt served for mattress and
bedding for Hawk and his sunken eyes above his black beard showed how sorely he needed surgical
care.  To this, Laramie lost no time in getting.  He provided more lights, opened his kit of
dressings and with a pail of water went to work.

What would have seemed impossible to a surgeon, Laramie with two hours' crude work accomplished
on Hawk's wounds.  But in a country where the air is so pure that major operations may be performed
in ordinary cabins, cleanliness and care, even though rude, count for more than they possibly
could elsewhere.  The most difficult part of the task that night lay in getting water up the
almost sheer canyon wall from the river three hundred feet below.  It would have been a man's
job in daylight; add to this black night and the care necessary to leave no traces of getting
down and climbing up.

Leaving Hawk when the night was nearly spent, Laramie returned to his horse, retraced his blind
way through the bad lands and got to the road some miles above where he had left it.  He started
for home but left the road below his place and picking a trail through the hills came out half
a mile northwest of his cabin.  Here he cached his saddle and bridle, turned loose his horse
and going forward with the stealth of an Indian he got close enough to his cabin to satisfy
himself, after painstaking observation, that his cabin was neither in the hands of the enemy,
nor under close-range surveillance.  When he reached the house he disposed of his rifle, slipped
inside and struck a light.  On the stove he found his frying pan face downward and the coffee
pot near it with the lid raised.  From this he knew that Simeral in his absence had cared for
his stock; and being relieved in his mind on this score he laid his revolver at hand and threw
himself on the bed to sleep.  Day was just breaking.

CHAPTER XXII

STONE TRIES HIS HAND

In getting home safely, Laramie had not flattered himself that he was not actually under what
in mountain phrase is termed the death watch. In matter of fact, Van Horn and Doubleday had
gone home to stay until the excitement should blow over.  But they had left Stone and two men
charged with intercepting Laramie on his return.  The investing lines had not, however, been
skilfully drawn and Laramie had slipped through.

He slept undisturbed until the sun was an hour high.  Then peering through a corner of the
blanket that hung before the window he saw Stone and two companions half a mile from the house,
riding slowly as if looking for a trail; particularly, as he readily surmised, for his own
trail.  As to his horse betraying him, Laramie had no fear, knowing the beast would make straight
for the blue stem north of the hills.  It was no part of Laramie's plan of defense to begin
fighting or to force any situation that favored him--as he believed the present one to do.

Few men that knew his enemies would have agreed with him in this view; they would, indeed,
have thought it extremely precarious for Laramie to be caught in any place he could not escape
from unseen.  But Laramie was temperamentally a gambler with fortune and he put aside the worries
that occasionally weighed on his friends.  Standing at his one small window--though this was
by no means the only peephole in the cabin walls--he watched without undue concern the scouting
of the trio, who beyond doubt had been hired to kill him and were only waiting their chance.

After a long inspection of the ground--much of it out of sight of the cabin--broken by frequent
colloquies, the three rode from the creek bottom out on the upper field and, halting, surveyed
the distant cabin with seeming doubt and suspicion.  Two of them reined their horses toward
the creek.  The third man spurred up the long slope straight for the house.

This put a different aspect on things.  Laramie tightened a little as he watched the oncoming
rider.  If it should prove to be Stone--he hesitated at the thought, deciding on nothing until
sure who the man might be.  But watching the approach of the unwelcome visitor coldly, Laramie
put out his hand for his rifle.  He thought of firing a warning shot; but to this he was much
averse since it would mean a fight and a siege--neither of which he sought.  As the man drew
closer it was apparent that it was not Stone and Laramie decided that milder measures might
answer.  He held his rifle across his arm and waited.  But the man, as if conscious of the
peril to which he was so coolly exposing himself, galloped rapidly away, rejoined his companions
and the trio disappeared.

Laramie at the window watched the departing horsemen.  It appeared, from what he had seen,
as if the watch had really been set on him.  He got out his little bottle of oil and a rag
and ramrod to clean his rifle.  He made the preparations and sat down to his task in a brown study.

The rifle had not been fired for some time, and it was a very long time since it had been trained
on a man.  He took it apart slowly, thinking less of what would next appear through the range
of the sights than of Kate, as she confronted him the night before in Carpy's office.  He realized
with a sort of shame that he was trying to forgive her for calling him a thief--which, in point
of fact, he argued, she had not actually done.  And though she had certainly spoken careless-like,
as Bill Bradley might say, she had only credited the tales of his enemies in her own household.

Laramie poked and squinted as he pondered his difficulties.  He had refused to give up Hawk
to be merely murdered; he could not do less and respect himself.  It had made her father more
than ever his enemy; still he wanted Kate.  Stone would assassinate him at any time for a hundred
dollars; Van Horn, now that he was aware Laramie liked Kate, would do it for nothing.  Laramie,
indeed, realized that if he stood in Van Horn's way with a woman he would not figure any more
in Harry's calculations than a last year's birds' nest.  And back of all loomed rancorous Barb
Doubleday.

How, he asked himself, could a girl like Kate, pick such a bear for a father?  All of which
troublesome thinking brought him no nearer a solution of his difficulties.  He had his life
to look out for, Hawk to take care of and a strong-willed girl to bring to his way of thinking.

He reached, at last, the conclusion that the sooner he knew whether he could leave his own
place and ride to and from Sleepy Cat without being "potted" from ambush, the sooner he would
know what to do next. Persuading himself that the watch would wait for him somewhere down the
road, Laramie, making coffee and cooking bacon, breakfasted, made his final preparations for
death by shaving himself with a venerable razor, and rifle in hand, got down as directly and
briskly as possible to the corral.  He got up a horse, rode back into the hills, and recovering
his saddle, started for Simeral's.  Having spoken with Ben, Laramie made a detour that brought
him out on the creek a mile below his usual trail.  Thence he rode as contentedly as possible
on his way.

The country for a few miles ahead was adapted for ambuscades.  The valley was comparatively
narrow and afforded more than one vantage point for covering a traveler.  It was wholly a matter,
Laramie felt, of bluffing it through.  And beyond keeping a brisk pace with his horse, he could
do nothing to protect himself.  "You're a fool for luck, Jim," he remembered Hawk's saying
once to him, "but you'll get it sometime on your fool's luck, just the same."

When old Blackbeard, as he sometimes called Hawk--though no one else ventured to call him that--uttered
the warning, it made no impression on Laramie.  Now it came back.  Not unpleasantly, nor as
a dread--only he did recall at this time the words--which was more than he had ever done before.
And he reflected that it would be very awkward for Hawk, if their common enemies should get
his nurse at this particular time.

While this was running through his mind, he was not sorry to notice ahead of him the dust of
the down stage.  At that particular stretch of the road it would be less nerve-wearing to ride
beside it a way.  He overtook the wagon and to his surprise found McAlpin on the box. McAlpin,
overjoyed to see him, explained with a grin he was filling in for a sick man.  In reality,
he had substituted for the northern trip in the hope of seeing some fighting while out and
the sight of Laramie was the nearest he had got to it.  Laramie, after a long talk, made an
appointment to meet him in town in the evening and as they reached the foot of the hill where
the road climbed to the Sleepy Cat divide, Laramie feeling he had no further excuse for loitering,
put spurs to his horse and took a bridle trail, used as a cut-off, to get into safer country.

He rode this trail unmolested, crossed the divide and coming out of the hills could see, to
the south, Sleepy Cat lying below.  He made up his mind that his judgment was more nearly right
than his apprehension, and rode down the slopes of the Crazy Woman, over the Double-draw bridge
and up the south hill in good spirits.  He had, in fact, got half-way up the long grade when
he heard a rifle shot.

Knocked forward the next instant in his saddle, Laramie drooped over his pommel.  As his heels
struck the horse's flanks, the beast sprang ahead.  The rebound jerked back the rider's head
and shoulders.  While the horse dashed on, Laramie with as little fuss as possible pulled his
rifle from its scabbard, trying all the time to get his balance.  A careful observer could
have noted that the rifle was drawn but held low in the right hand as if the rider could not
bring it up.  Yet even a close observer could hardly have detected in his convulsive swaying
that the wounded man was closely scanning the sides of the narrow road along which his horse
was now flying.  At all events, he seemed with failing strength to be losing his seat as he
lost control of his horse, and a hundred yards from where he had been struck he toppled helplessly
from the saddle into the roadway.  The speed at which the horse was going sent the fallen rider
rolling along the grade, the sides of which had been torn in spots by summer torrents.  Near
one of these holes, Laramie had left the saddle, and into it he rolled headlong.

The hole, between four and five feet deep, looked like an irregular well with an overhang on
one side and to the bottom of this, Laramie, covered with dust, tumbled.  He righted himself
and turning under the overhang took breath, put down his rifle, whipped out his revolver, looked
toward the top of his well and listened.

Not a sound broke the stillness of the sunny morning.  With his right hand, but holding his
eyes and ears very much at attention, he drew a handkerchief, wiped the dust from his eyes
and face and twisted his head around to investigate the stinging sensation high on his left
shoulder, almost at the neck.  The rifle bullet had torn his coat collar and shirt and creased
the skin.  He could feel no blood and soon inventoried the shot as only close.  But he was
waiting for the man that fired it to appear at the hole to investigate; and with at least this
one of his enemies he was in a mood to finish then and there.

Taking off his coat, as his wits continued to work, he spread it over a little hump in front
of him so it would catch the eye for an instant and with patient rage crouched back under the
overhang.  He so placed himself that one could hardly see him without peering into the hole
and that might mean any one of several things for the man that ventured it--much depended,
in Laramie's mind, on whose face he should see above the rim.

An interminable time passed.  The first sound he heard was that of horses toiling up the long
grade and the creaking of battered hubs; this he reckoned must be McAlpin with the stage. 
Where his hat had rolled to, when he tumbled out of the saddle to simulate death, he had no
idea.  If it lay in the road he might expect a visit from McAlpin. But without stopping, the
stage rattled slowly up the grade.

It seemed then as if the distant gunman, after waiting for the stage to pass, would not fail
to reconnoiter the hole.  Yet he did so fail.  The high hours of midday passed with Laramie
patiently resting his Colt's up between his knees and studying the yellow rim of the hole and
the heavenly blue of the sky.  His neck ached from the cramped position, long held, in which
he had placed himself; but he moved no more than if he had been set in stone.  Neither hunger,
which was slight, nor thirst, at times troublesome, disturbed his watch.  But it was in vain.

He sat like a spider in its web through the whole day without an incident.  A few horsemen
passed, an occasional wagon rumbled up and down the hill; but none of the travelers looked
in on Laramie.  Toward dusk he heard a freighting outfit working laboriously up from the creek.
Resolving to give up his watch and go into town with this, he felt his way cautiously out of
his hiding place.  Without really hoping to recover it, he began to search for his hat and
to his surprise found it in another gully near where he had tumbled from his horse.  The driver
of the freighting outfit wondered at seeing Laramie on foot.  He explained that he had been
hunting and that his horse had taken a short-cut home.

Stone's companions under instructions had left him and returned to Doubleday's before the shot
across the Crazy Woman.  Stone himself got back to Doubleday's ranch at about the time that
Laramie started for Sleepy Cat in the evening.  But Barb Doubleday and Van Horn, he was told,
were in town.  He followed them and discovered Van Horn in the bar room at the hotel.

"I hear you got him," muttered Van Horn, bending his keen eyes on Stone.

"Who said so?" demanded Stone.

"His horse came into Kitchen's barn this afternoon, all saddled. McAlpin is telling he heard
a rifle shot on the Crazy Woman.  They're wild down at the barn over it.  Did you get him?"

Stone paused over a glass of whisky; his face brightened: "I tumbled him off his horse, if
you call that getting him."

Van Horn asked questions impatiently.  Stone answered with the indifference of the man that
had turned a big trick.  But Van Horn insisted on knowing what had become of Laramie.

"He tumbled into a hole," said Stone.  "I didn't cross the creek to look for him."

"Why didn't you?" asked Van Horn nervously.

Stone dallied with his glass: "I watched the hole all day.  He didn't come out.  That was enough,
wasn't it?"

"No," snapped Van Horn.

"Well, I'll tell you, Harry; next time you and the old man want a job done, do it yourself.
I never liked Laramie: I didn't care for getting too close to the hole he tumbled into.  After
he was hit, he stuck to his horse a little too long to suit me," said Stone shrewdly.

Van Horn's retort was contemptuous and pointed.  He laughed: "Afraid of him, eh?"

Stone regarded him malevolently: "Look here!" he exclaimed harshly, "I'll make you a little
proposition.  When I get shaved we'll ride over to the Crazy Woman and you c'n look in the
hole for yourself."

The uncertainty irritated Van Horn.  When Stone, newly plastered, emerged from the barber shop,
Van Horn took him with his story to Doubleday whom they found in his room, chewing the stub
of a cold cigar and looking over a stock journal.  He did not appear amiable, nor did his face
change much as the news was cautiously conveyed to him.  When Van Horn announced he would ride
out with Stone to examine the road hole, Doubleday, whose expression had grown colder and colder,
broke in:

"Needn't waste any time on that," he said with a snap of his jaw.

Stone snorted: "Maybe you think he wasn't hit."

"Hit!" exclaimed Barb.  "Hit!" he repeated, raising a long forefinger with deep-drawn disgust.
"He's sittin' in that room across the hall right now----"

"What's he doin'?"

"Playin' poker," muttered the old cattleman grimly, "with Doc. Carpy and Harry Tenison."

CHAPTER XXIII

KATE RIDES

In strict point of fact, Laramie had left the room across the hall and at that particular moment
was sitting down for a late supper at Belle Shockley's whither Sawdy and Lefever had dragged
him from the hotel. Carpy had come with them.

At the table--after Laramie had told part of his story--the talk, genial to cheerfulness, was
largely professional criticism of the shot across the Crazy Woman.  The technical disadvantages
of shooting uphill, the tendency to over-elevate for such shots, the difficulty of catching
the pace and speed of a horse, all supplied judicial observations for Lefever and Sawdy, while
Laramie--so nearly the victim--leaving the topic to these Sleepy Cat gun pundits, conferred
with Carpy about the care of gunshot wounds; and protested against Flat Nose George and the
Museum of Horrors in the Doctor's office.

"But I want to tell you, boys," remarked the doctor, when the talk turned on the discomfiture
of the enemy group, "what Barb asked me tonight--this is on the dead."  The doctor looked around
to include Belle--who was standing with folded arms, her back against the sideboard and listening
to the conversation--in his injunction of secrecy.  "He came to me at the hotel.  'Doc,' says
Barb, 'I want to ask you a question.  There's stories circulating around about Laramie's getting
shot this morning, on his way into town.  Has Laramie been to you to get fixed up, at all?'

"'Well, Barb,' I says, 'that's not really a fair question for me to answer--you know that.
But since you spoke about it, Jim was in awhile ago----'

"'Was in, eh?'

"'For a few minutes----'

"'Hit?'

"'That I couldn't say.  What he asked for, Barb, was a bottle of Perry Davis' painkiller--said
the rheumatiz was getting him to beat the band.'"

Carpy paused:  "'Rheumatiz!' says Barb.  He didn't stop to swear--he just bit his old cigar
right square in two in the middle, dropped one end on the floor and stamped on it."  The Doctor
leaned forward and spoke to Laramie: "How's longhorn, Jim?"

Laramie looked troubled: "If it wasn't for dragging you into it, I'd ask you to go out and
see him."

"Jim, a doctor's place is where he's needed."

"I left a twenty dollar gold piece in your medicine chest for the stuff I took."

"You go to hell!"  The Doctor pulled a handful of money from his pocket and threw a double
eagle at Laramie.  "There's your gold piece."

"Belle, look at them fellows," exclaimed Sawdy moodily, "pockets loaded.  I never had more
than twenty dollars at one time in my life. My mother told me to take care of the pennies and
the dollars would take care of themselves.  The blamed dollars wouldn't do it.  I took care
of the pennies.  I've got 'em yet--that's all I have got.  Jim, I'll match you for that gold
piece."

"Gamblers never have a cent," commented Belle darkly.

"That gold piece," explained Laramie, "is not my money, Harry.  It's Carpy's money and he'll
keep it if I have to make him swallow it."

"That's not the question," declared Carpy.  "Did you get what you wanted?"  Laramie told him
he did.  "And by the great Jehosaphat," added the doctor, "you bumped into Kate Doubleday!"

"What else did you expect?" retorted Laramie, not pleased at the recollection.

Carpy, throwing back his head, laughed well: "After Kate Doubleday told me she was going for
the dressings herself, I says to myself, 'There'll be two people in my house tonight--a man
and a woman--I hope to God they don't meet.'"

"Jim," intervened Belle, "you ought to get Abe Hawk to a hospital."

"He's got to get him to one," affirmed Lefever.  "I've seen that man," he added emphatically,
"I know."

"How's he going to do it," inquired Carpy, "without starting the fight all over again?"

Lefever stuck to his ground: "Get him down to Sleepy Cat in the night," he insisted.

"Can he ride?" asked Sawdy.

"He may have to have help," said Laramie.

"There's a moon right now.  They'd pick you off like rabbits," objected Sawdy, "and they've
got that whole trail patroled to the Crazy Woman. They're watching this town like cats.  You'll
have to waste a lot of ammunition to get Abe to a hospital."

"From all I hear," observed Carpy, "if Abe gets any more lead in him you won't need to take
him to the hospital.  He'll be ready to head straight for the undertaker's."

"We've got to wait either for a late moon or a rainy night; then we'll get busy," suggested
Lefever.

"He might die while you're waiting," interposed Carpy.

Lefever could not be subdued: "Not as quick as he'd die if Van Horn's bunch caught sight of
him on the road," he said sententiously.  "We'll get him down and he won't die, either."

"Well, pay for your supper, boys, and let's get away," said Carpy.  "I want some sleep."

But for Lefever and Sawdy there was little sleep that night.  The echoes of the "fatal" shot--almost
fatal, as it proved, to the prestige of the enemy--were being discussed pretty much everywhere
in Sleepy Cat and wherever men that night assembled in public places, Sawdy and Lefever swaggered
in and out at least once.  The pair looked wise, spoke obscurely, looked the crowd, large or
small, over critically, played an occasional restrained and brief finger-tattoo on the butts
of their bolstered guns and listened condescendingly to everyone that had a theory to advance,
a reminiscence to offer, or a propitiating drink to suggest.

Wherever they could induce him to go, they dragged Laramie--at once as an exhibit and a defi;
but Laramie objected to the thoroughness with which his companions essayed to cover the territory,
and unfeelingly withdrew from the party to go to bed.  Sawdy and Company, undismayed by the
defection, continued to haunt the high places until the last sympathizer with Van Horn and
Company had been challenged and bullied or silenced.

But the differing sympathies on the situation in Sleepy Cat were not to be adjusted in a single
night, either by force or persuasion.  The whole town took sides and the cattlemen found the
most defenders.  What might be designated, but with modesty, as "big business" in Sleepy Cat
stood stubbornly, despite the violence of their methods, with Van Horn, Doubleday and their
friends; the interest of such business lay with the men that bought the most supplies.  The
banks and the merchants were thus pretty much aligned on one side.  The surgeon of the town
professed neutrality--at least as regarded operations--for he was needed to administer to both
factions.  Harry Tenison, as dealer of the big game in town and owner of the big hotel, was
of necessity neutral; though men like himself and Carpy were rightly suspected of leaning toward
Laramie, if not even as far as toward Abe Hawk.  The open sympathizers of the Falling Wall
men were among trainmen, liverymen, the clerks, the barbers and bartenders, and those who could
be usually counted as "agin the government."

Meantime, the element of mystery in the still unclosed tragedy of the upper country concerned
the disappearance of Hawk; and this naturally centered about Laramie.  None but he knew to
a certainty the fate of the redoubtable old cowboy, so long a range favorite.  And whenever
Laramie appeared in town, speculation at once revived every feature of the situation, and Kate
Doubleday when she came to Sleepy Cat, whether she would or not, could not escape the talk
concerning the Falling Wall feud.

Loyalty to her own and the intense partizanship of her nature, combined to urge her to sympathize
with the fight of the range owners against the Falling Wall men.  But in this attitude, Belle
Shockley was a trial to Kate.  Belle would not drag in the subject of the fight but she never
avoided it; and Kate, even against her inclination, seemed impelled to speak of the subject
with Belle.  She instinctively felt that Belle's sympathies were with the other side; and felt
just as strongly in her impulsiveness, that Belle should be set right about rustlers and their
friends--meaning always, by the latter, Jim Laramie. Belle, stubborn but more contained, clung
to her own views.  Though she rarely talked back, the attempt to assassinate Laramie had intensified
everyone's feelings, and for days only a spark on that subject was needed to fire more than
one Sleepy Cat powder magazine.  One afternoon rain caught Kate in at Belle's and kept her
until almost dark from starting for home, and one magazine did explode.

The two women were sitting on the porch watching the shower.  McAlpin on his way uptown from
the barn, had stopped at Belle's a moment for shelter.

"I'll tell you, Kate," said Belle, after listening as patiently as she could to what Kate had
to say about the Falling Wall fight and its consequences, "I like you.  I can't help liking
you.  But the only reason you talk the way you do is because you haven't lived in this country
long.  You don't know this country--you don't know the people."

McAlpin nodded strongly: "That's so, that's true."

"I, at least, know common honesty, I hope."

"But you don't know anything at all of what you are talking about," insisted Belle, "and if
you think I'm ever going to agree with you that it was right for Van Horn and your father and
their friends to take a bunch of Texas men up into the Falling Wall and shoot and burn men
because they're rustlers, you're very much mistaken.  And I can tell you the people of this
country won't agree with you either, no matter what some folks in this town may say to tickle
your ears."

"Do you mean to say you stand up for thieves, too?" asked Kate, hotly.

McAlpin looked apprehensively out at the clouds.  Belle twitched her shoulders: "You needn't
be so high and mighty about it," she retorted. "No, I don't.  And I don't stand up for burning
men alive because they brand mavericks.  You talk very fierce--like everybody up your way.
But if Abe Hawk or Jim Laramie walked in here this minute, you wouldn't agree to have them
shot down.  And don't you forget it, Jim Laramie doesn't claim a hoof of anybody's cattle but
his own."

Kate would not back down: "Why do they call him king of the rustlers?" she demanded.

"King of the rustlers, nothing," echoed Belle in disgust.  "That's barroom talk.  No decent
man ever accused him of branding so much as a horse hair that didn't belong to him."

"And his reputation is, he's not very slow when it comes to shooting, either," declared Kate.

McAlpin thought it a time for oil on the waters!  "You've got to make allowances," he urged
with dignity.  "Ten years ago--less'n that, even--they was all pretty quick on the trigger
in this country.  Jim was a kid 'n' he had to travel with the bunch."

"And he was quicker 'n any of them," interposed Belle, defiantly, "wasn't he, Mac?"

McAlpin was for moderation and better feeling:

"Well," he admitted gravely, "full as quick, I guess."

"It seems to me," observed Kate, still resentful, "as if men here are pretty quick yet."

"Oh, no," interposed McAlpin at once; "oh, no, not special now'days. More talk'n there used
to be--heap more."

"Bring over my pony, Mr. McAlpin, will you?" asked Kate, very much irritated.

McAlpin looked surprised:  "You wouldn't be ridin' home tonight?"

"Yes," replied Kate, sharply, "I would."

As McAlpin started on his way she turned on Belle: "And you mustn't forget, Belle, that vigilantes,
no matter whether they do make mistakes or go too far, have built this country up and made
it safe to live in."

Belle's face took on a weariness: "Oh, no--not always safe to live in--sometimes safe to make
money in.  There's nothing I'm so sick of hearing as this vigilante stuff.  The vigilante crowd
are mostly big thieves--the rustlers, little thieves--that's about all the difference I can see."

"Well, is there any difference between being a rustler, and protecting and being the friend
of one?"

Belle's restraint broke: "You'd better set your own house in order before you criticize me
or Jim Laramie.  He's never yet tried to assassinate anybody."

"Neither has my father, nor the men that raided the Falling Wall."

"Don't you know," demanded Belle, indignantly, "that the men who raided the Falling Wall are
the men that tried to murder Laramie?"

"I don't believe it," said Kate, flatly.  "Father doesn't believe anybody tried to murder him."

Belle's wrath bubbled over: "Your father's as deep in it as anybody."

She could have bitten her tongue off the instant she uttered the angry words.  But they were out.

Kate sprang to her feet.  Even Belle, used to shocks and encounters, was silenced by the look
that met her.  For a moment the angry girl did not utter a word, but if her eyes were daggers,
Belle would have been transfixed.  Kate's breast rose sharply and she spoke low and fast: "How
dare you accuse my father of such a thing?"

Belle, though cowed, was defiant: "I dare say just what I believe to be true."

"What proof have you?"

"I don't need proof for what everyone knows."

"You say what is absolutely false."  Kate's tranquil eyes were aflame; she stood child, indeed,
of her old father.  Belle had more than once doubted whether Kate could be the daughter of
such a man--she never doubted it after that scene on the day of the rain.  Barb himself would
have waited on his daughter's words.  "You're glad to listen to the stories of our enemies,"
she almost panted, "because they're your friends; you're welcome to them.  But my father's
enemies are my enemies and I know now where to place you."

White with anger as she was herself, Belle, older and more controlled, tried to allay the storm
she had raised: "I didn't meant to hurt you, Kate," she protested, "you drove me too far."

"I'm glad I did," returned Kate, wickedly, as she stepped back into the living-room, pinned
on her hat and made ready as fast as possible to go.  "I know you in your true colors."

"Well, whether I'm right or wrong, you'll find my colors don't fade and don't change."

A boy stood at the gate with Kate's pony.

The two women were again on the porch.  Belle looked at the sky.  The rain had abated but the
mountains were black.  "Now, Kate, what are you going to do?"

Kate had walked out and was indignantly throwing the lines over her horse's neck.  "I'm going
home," she answered, as sharply as the words could be spoken.

Belle crossed the sidewalk to her side: "This is a poor time of day for a long ride.  We've
quarreled, I know, but don't try a mountain trail a night like this.  The rain isn't over yet."

"I'll be home before it starts again," returned Kate, springing into the saddle.  "I'm sick
of this town and everybody in it."

So saying, she struck her horse with the lines and headed for the mountains.

CHAPTER XXIV

NIGHT AND A HEADER

For John Lefever the rainy night promised to be a busy one; darkness and the storm would, he
felt, give Laramie a chance to get Hawk safely into town; but to do this successfully would
call for precaution.

The rain had hardly begun to fall that afternoon--to the discomfiture of Kate and her undoing
with Belle--before Lefever began to cheer up in speculating on what might be done.  He found
Laramie at the hotel and set out to round up Sawdy.  The rendezvous was set at Kitchen's barn
and half an hour later the three men were shut up in the old harness room back of the office
to talk the venture over.

Laramie made no effort to discourage John concerning the project; it had become a pet one with
the big fellow; but he did not give the idea strong endorsement.  "You're too blamed pessimistic,
Jim," growled Lefever.

"No, John," protested Laramie evenly, "I'm only trying to see things as they stand.  Don't
figure we are going to pull this thing without trouble.  Harry Van Horn's got a good guess
that Dave is pretty well shot up; and that he's hiding out.  He knows a man can't hide out
without friends."

"I grant you that," interrupted John.  "But if you can get him across the Crazy Woman, Jim,
it's a cinch to run him into town."

"Don't figure that every mile of that road isn't watched, for it is.  I ride it oftener than
you and I see plenty of sign.  And Harry knows what a rainy night means just as well as we
do.  He'll be on the job with his men--that's all I'm saying.  Now, go ahead.  You want Abe
brought in--that's your business.  I'm here to bring him in--that's my business.  Shoot."

Laramie and Lefever arranged things.  Number Seventy-eight, the through fast freight, would
be due to leave Sleepy Cat for Medicine Bend at 4:32 in the morning.  The crew were friendly.
Could Laramie make it with Abe, starting by midnight?  He could.  It was impossible to meet
Laramie outside town because no one could tell which trail he might have to choose to come
in on.  But Sawdy and Lefever could look for him out on the plateau at the head of Fort Street.
Henry Sawdy, his heavy mustaches sweeping his thick lips, and his bloodshot eyes moving from
one to the other of the two faces before him only stared and listened.

"Why don't you say something, Henry?" demanded Lefever, exasperated.

Sawdy turned a reproachful look on his lively partner:  "When you're talking, John, there ain't
no chance to say anything.  When Jim's talking, I don't want to say anything."

Laramie ordered his horse, got into oilskins, and riding out the back way of the stable started
for the Falling Wall.  The day was spent and the rain had turned soft and misty.  He rode fast
and with a little watchfulness, exercised before reaching the Crazy Woman, satisfied himself
that he had not been followed out of town.

What had actually happened was that he rode north not long after Kate herself started for home.
But Laramie followed old trails out of town--even at the price of rounding fences and at times
dodging through wire gates for short cuts.  Night was upon him when he reached the bluffs of
the creek.  Between showers the sky had lightened, but the north was overcast, and Laramie
knew what to look forward to.  When he had got up the long hill, and reached the northern bluffs,
it was raining steadily again, and night had spread over mountain and valley.

Abating something of his usual precaution in riding to reach Hawk's hiding place, Laramie went
slowly into the bad lands by a route less dangerous than that he usually followed.  As the
night deepened, the wind rising brought a heavier rain.  The trail became increasingly difficult
to follow; rough at best, it was now almost impassable. Sheets of water trickled over stretches
of rock causing the horse to slip and flounder.  In other places rivulets shooting out of crevices
cut the loose earth from under the horse's feet.  Leg-tired, the horse finally resented being
headed into the driving rain and went forward slipping, hesitating and groping like a man on
hands and knees.

When Laramie got him to the old bridge, the pony was all in.  Laramie found shelter for him
under a ledge and rifle in hand clambered along the side of the canyon toward the abutment.
Close to the entrance he set his rifle against the rock, listened carefully, as always, felt
down at his feet for the few chips of rock he had so placed that they would be disturbed if
trodden by an enemy, listened again carefully, and with his revolver cocked in his right hand,
and the muzzle lying across his left forearm, Laramie slowly zigzagged his way to the inside.
Once there, he stood perfectly still in the darkness and called a greeting to Hawk.  He failed
to receive the usual gruff answer.  This never before had happened, and without trying for
a light, Laramie moved slowly and with much caution over to the recess within which Hawk lay.
There he could hear the cowboy's labored, but regular breathing as he slept.  The storm, waking
the water crevices of the mountains into a noisy chorus, had lulled the hunted man into an
untroubled sleep.

Laramie shook his oilskins in a heap on the floor, cautiously lighted a candle and set it on
the board that served as a table.  In spite of his slickers he was wet through.  He hung his
hat on the end of a broken timber and laid his revolver beside the candle.  Bethinking himself,
however, of his rifle, he picked up the six-shooter again, stepped outside the entrance, brought
in his rifle, wiped it, stood it in a convenient corner and turned toward Hawk.

The candle, burning at moments steadily and at moments flickering, threw its uncertain rays
into the recess where the wounded rustler lay. They lighted the sallow pallor of the sleeping
man's face, fell across his sunken eyes and drew the black of his long beard out of the gloom
below it.  Laramie seated himself on a projecting ledge and looked thoughtfully at his charge.
He was failing; of that there could be no doubt.  Steel-willed and hard-sinewed though he was,
the wounds that would long ago have put an ordinary man out of action, were undermining his
great vitality and Laramie, in a study, felt it.

Yet such was the younger man's natural stubbornness that left to his own devices he would have
fought out the battle against death right where the failing man lay; only the judgment of Lefever
and Carpy swayed him in the circumstances.

Believing sleep was the best preparative for the ordeal of the ride to town, Laramie hesitated
about waking Hawk--yet the hours were precious, for the trip would be long and slow.  Fortunately
he had not long to wait before Hawk woke.

Laramie was sitting a few feet away and silently looking at him when Hawk opened his eyes.
They wandered from one object to another in the dim candle gloom, until they rested on Laramie's
face; there they stopped.

Laramie's features relaxed into as near a smile as he permitted himself on duty: "How you coming,
Abe?"

Hawk eyed him steadily: "What are you doing here tonight?"

Laramie answered with a question: "How about trying the gauntlet?"

"That what you want?"

"It's what Lefever and Carpy want."

"They running things?"

"They think you'd get well full as quick at a hospital."

"What do you think?"

"I guess you would."

"Tired taking care of me?"

"Not yet, Abe."

"Raining?"

"Hell bent."

"What's the other noise?"

"Thunder; and the river's up."

The roar of the waters was not new to the ears of the two men who listened, however much it
might have disturbed others unused to their tearing fury.

Hawk listened thoughtfully: "Why didn't you pick a wet night?" he asked.

"We had to pick a dark one, Abe."

"Where's the horses?"

"Over at my place--what's that?"

The last words broke from Laramie's lips like the crack of a pistol. He sprang to his feet.
Hawk's hand shot out for his gun.  Only practised ears could have detected under the steady
downpour of rain, the deep roar of the canyon and the reverberation of the thunder, the hoof
beats of a stumbling horse.  The next instant, they heard the horse directly over their heads.
Laramie, whipping out his revolver, looked up.  As he did so, a deafening crash blotted out
the roar of the storm--the roof overhead gave way and amid an avalanche of rock and timbers,
a horse plunged headlong into the refuge.

In the narrow quarters so amazingly invaded, darkness added to an instant of frantic confusion.
Laramie was knocked flat.  In the midst of the fallen timbers, the horse, mad with terror,
struggled to get to his feet.  A suppressed groan betrayed the rider under him.

Laramie, where he lay, gun in hand, and Hawk, had but one thought: their retreat had been discovered
and attacked.  It was no part of their defense to reveal their presence by wild shooting. 
The enemy who had plunged in on top of them was at their mercy, even though unseen. He was
caught under the horse, and to clap a revolver to his head and blow the top off was simple;
it could be done at any moment.  Of much greater import it was, carefully to await his companions
when they rode up, above, and pick them off as chance offered.  Escape, if the raiding party
were properly organized, both men knew was for them impossible--and they knew that Harry Van
Horn organized well.  The alternative was to sell their lives as dearly as possible.

This was by no means a terrifying conclusion to men inured to affray. And for the moment, at
feast, the situation was in their hands, not in the enemies'.

A deluge of wind and rain swept through the broken roof.  Laramie, stretching one arm through
the debris, felt the shoulder of the rider, flung in the violence of the fall close to him.

The prostrate horse renewed his struggles to get to his feet.

Laramie, exposed to the pouring rain, covered with mud, bruised by broken rock still rolling
down the open crater, and caught among rotten timbers, struggled to right himself before his
enemy should do so.  He raised himself by a violent effort to his elbow, freed his pistol arm
and reaching over, pushed his cocked revolver into the side of the fallen horseman.

A bolt of lightning shot across the crater, leaving behind it an inky blackness of rain and
wind.  The sudden onslaught from overhead might well have confused his senses; but he had seen
the lightning sweep across a white, drawn face turned toward the angry sky--and in the flash
he had caught the features of Kate Doubleday.

Stunned though he was by the revelation, he knew his senses had not tricked him.  There was
in his memory but one such riding cap as that which shaded her closed eyes; for him, but one
such coil of woman's hair as that falling now in disarray on her neck.  Completely unnerved,
he carefully drew away his revolver, averted the muzzle and spoke angrily through the dark:
"Who's here with you?"

There was no answer.  He asked the question sternly again, listening keenly the while for sounds
of other riders above.  Had she discovered the retreat and led to it his enemies?  Could it
be possible that even they would allow her with them on such an errand and on such a night?

He called her name.  The roar of the canyon answered above the storm; there was no sound else.
Once more he stretched out his arm.  His hand rested on her breast and he was doubly sure his
senses had not tricked him.  But she might be dying or dead.  The fear struck home that she
was dead.  Then her bosom rose in a hardly perceptible respiration.

A storm of emotion swept Laramie.  He squirmed under the debris that pinned him and got nearer
to her.  He listened still for sounds of an enemy, of those who must be with her--where could
they be?  The delicate breathing under his heavy hand came more regularly.  Then a moan of
pain checked and, again, released it.

Feeling slowly in the stormy dark for obstructions that might have caught her, Laramie freed
one of her feet caught in the stirrup and by pushing and lifting at the shoulder of the horse
succeeded after much exertion in freeing her other foot, caught under it.  He felt his way
back to Kate's head and getting on his feet placed his hands under her shoulders to draw her
toward him.

As he did so, a sharp question of fear and confusion was flung at him: "Where am I?  Who are you?"

"Who are you?" echoed Laramie, pulling her away from the horse which had begun to struggle
again.  "Who's here with you?" he demanded. There was no answer.

"Who's here with you?" he repeated sternly.  "Tell me the truth."

"I've lost my way.  Where am I?  Who are you?"

The truth in her manner was plain.  Incredible as it seemed that she could have strayed so
far, all apprehension of an attack vanished with her questions.

"You're a long way from home," he said, shortly.

She made no reply.

"Your horse took a header.  You fainted.  I suppose"--he hardly hesitated in his words--"you
know who is talking to you?"

In her silence he heard his answer.

CHAPTER XXV

A GUEST FOR AN HOUR

"Can you stand on your feet?" he asked.

Supporting her as she made the trial he felt his way from where the horse had plunged through
to where he found a partial seat for her. "Are you much hurt?" he asked again.

She could not, if she would, have told in how many places she was broken and bruised.  All
she was sharply conscious of was a pain in one foot so intense as to deaden all other pain.
It was the foot that had been caught under the horse.  "I think I'm all right," she murmured,
in a constrained tone and, in her manner, briefly.  "How did you find me here?" she asked,
almost resentfully.  "Where am I?"

He knew from her words she had neither headed nor followed any expedition against him but he
did not answer her question: "I'll see whether I can get the horse up."

While he worked with the horse--and once during the long, hard effort she heard between thunder
claps a sharp expletive--Kate tried to collect in some degree her scattered and reeling senses.
What quieted her most was that her long and fear-stricken groping for hours in the storm and
darkness seemed done now.  Without realizing it she was willingly turning her fears and troubles
over to another--and to one who, though she stubbornly refused to regard him as a friend, she
well knew was able to shoulder them.  She heard the kicking and pawing of the horse, then with
new dismay, the low voices of two men; and next in the terrifying darkness, more kicking, more
suppressed expletives, more heaving and pulling, and between lightning flashes, quieting words
to the horse.  The two men had gotten the frightened beast to his feet.

Laramie groped back to Kate.  He had to touch her with his hand to be sure he had found her:
"I'm taking you at your word," he said, above the confusion of the storm.

"What do you mean?"

"That you're alone and don't know where you are."

"I am alone.  I wish I might know where I am."

Both spoke under constraint: "It's more important to know how to get home," he replied, ignoring
the request in her words.  "Your horse is here for the night--that's pretty certain," he declared,
as a sheet of rain swept over the crater.  "I've got a horse near by and we'll start for where
we can get more horses."

There was nothing Kate could say or do.  She already had made up her mind to submit in silence
to what Laramie might suggest or impose.  One thing only she was resolved on; that whatever
happened there should be no appeal on her part.

His first thought was to get her out of the pit by the way she had plunged in.  A moment's
reflection convinced him that such a precaution was unnecessary.  When he asked her to follow
him he held her wet gloved hand in his hand.  "Look out for your footing till we get to the
horse," was his warning.  "The way we're going, we should never make but one slip.  Take your
time," he added, as she stepped cautiously after him out into the drive of wind and rain. 
"It's only about twenty steps."

In obeying orders she gave him nothing to complain of, but there was little relaxing of the
tension between the two.  Every step she took on her injured foot was torture, made keener
by the uncertain footing. More than once, even despite the dangers of her situation, she thought
she must cry out or faint in agony.  The twenty steps along the steep face of the canyon, pelted
by rain, were like two hundred.  Kate made them without a whimper.  Thence she followed him
slowly between rocky walls guarding the nearly level floor of the widening ledge, till they
reached the horse.  She stumbled at times with pain; but if it were to kill her she would not
speak.

Hawk had followed the two from the abutment.  He joined them now.  Kate was only aware that
a second man had come up and was moving silently near them.  Laramie spoke to him--she could
not catch what he said--then helped her into the saddle.  "I'm going to the house again," he
said, "this man will stay with you.  I'll be back in a moment."

Little as she liked being left with another, she could not object.  The rocky wall saved her
partly from the storm and as to the other man she was only vaguely conscious at intervals of
a shapeless form outlined beside the horse.

Laramie was gone more than a moment but under Kate's shelter nothing happened.  The horse,
subdued by storm and weariness, stood like a statue.  Uneasy with pain, Kate was very nervous.
New sounds were borne on the wind from the darkness; then she heard Laramie's voice; and then
a rough question from another voice: "How the hell did you get him out?"

"Walked him out," was the response.  Laramie had brought back her own horse.  "Get on him,"
added Laramie, speaking to the other man.  "I'll lead my horse--he's sure-footed for her. 
You know the way down."

Kate made only one effort as the man she knew must be Laramie came to the head of the horse
she was on, patted his wet neck and took hold of the bridle.  She leaned forward in the saddle:
"I'll try again to get home if you'll help me get out of here."

"I'm helping you get out," was the reply.  "If you knew where you were, you wouldn't talk yet
about trying for home."  He stepped closer to the saddle, tested the cinches and spoke to Kate:
"It's a hard ride.  You can make it by letting the horse strictly alone.  I'll lead him but
he won't stand two bosses in this kind of a mess, over the only trail that leads from here.
How you ever got in, God only knows, and He won't tell--leastways, not tonight.  Sit tight.
Don't get scared no matter what happens.  If the horse should break a leg all we can do is
to shoot him and you can try your own horse; but your horse is all in now."

To ride at night a mile in the chilling blackness of a mountain storm is to ride five.  To
face a buffeting wind and a sweep of heavy rain mile after mile and keep a saddle while a horse
pauses, halts, starts and staggers, rights himself, gropes painfully for an uncertain foothold
among rocks where a bighorn must pick his way, is to test the endurance even of a man.

Laramie, moving unseen and almost unheard in the inky blackness, piloted the nervous beast
with an uncanny instinct, past the dangers on every hand.  He guided himself with his feet
and by his hands, halting on the edge of crevices and heading them with the horse at his shoulder,
feeling his way around slopes of fallen rock and clambering across them when they could not
be escaped, holding the lines at their length ahead of the horse and speaking low and reassuringly
to urge him on: waiting sometimes for a considerable period for a flash of lightning to give
him his bearings anew.

Kate could see in each of these blinding intervals his figure.  Each flash outlined it sharply
on her retina--always the same--patient, resourceful, silent and unwearied.  The man who had
been directed to ride her own horse she never caught sight of.  When they reached open country
and better going her guide did not break the silence.  He spoke only when at last he stopped
the horse and stood in the darkness close to her knee:

"This brings us to the end of our trail--for awhile.  We're in front of my cabin.  Of course,
it's small.  And I've been thinking what I ought to say to you about things as you'll find
them here.  The man that rode behind us and passed us on your horse is Abe Hawk.  You know
what they call him over at your place; you know what they call me for taking his part--you
know what you called me."

She repressed an exclamation.  When she tried to speak, he spoke on, ignoring her.  "Never
mind," he said, in the same low, even tone that silenced her protest, "I'm not starting any
argument but it's time for plain speaking and I'm going to tell you just what has happened
tonight, so, for once, anyway, we'll understand each other--I'm going to show my cards.",

The chilling sheets of rain that swept their faces did not hasten his utterance: "When you
get home and tell your story, your men will know it was Abe Hawk you ran into whether you knew
it or not.  They'll ask you all about his hiding place and you'll tell them all you know--which
won't be much.  I don't complain of all that--it's war; and part of the game.  All I'll ask
you not to say is, that I brought Abe Hawk with you to my cabin.  Abe won't be here when they
come--it isn't that.  We can take care of ourselves.  I'm speaking only because I don't want
my place burned.  It isn't much but I think a good deal of it.  Burning it won't help get rid
of me.  It will only make things in this country worse than they are now--and they're bad enough.
I wouldn't have brought you here if there'd been any other place to take you.  There wasn't;
and for awhile you'll have to make partners with the two men your father and his friends are
trying to get killed."

She almost cried out a protest: "How can you say such a thing?"

"Just the plain fact, that's all."

"Is it fair because you are enemies to accuse my father in such a way?"

"Have it as you want it but get my view of it with the one you get over at your place.  And
if you'll climb down we'll go under cover."

"Now may I say something?"

"No more than fair you should."

She spoke low but fast and distinctly; nor was there any note of fear or apology in her words:
"You must put a low estimate on a woman if you would expect her to go home with tales from
the camp of an enemy that had put her again on her road.  It may be that is the kind of woman
you know best----"

Laramie tried to interrupt.

"I've not done," she protested instantly.  "You said I might say something: It may be that
is the kind of woman you understand best. But I won't be classed with such--not even by you.
If you've saved me from great danger it doesn't give you the right to insult me by telling
me you expect me to be a tale-bearer.  It isn't manly or fair to treat me in that way."

"You mustn't expect too much from a thief."

"You shame yourself, not me, when you use a word I never in my life, not even in anger, ever
used of you."

"You shame your friends when you call me or think of me as anything else.  I'm no match for
you----"

"I've not done----"

"I'm no match for you, I know, in fine words--or in any other kind of a game--don't think I
don't know that; but by----" he checked himself just in time, "thief or no thief, you've had
a square deal from me every turn of the road."

Bitter with anger, he blurted out the words with vehemence.  If he looked for a quick retort,
none came.  Kate for an instant waited: "Should you wish me," she asked, "to look for anything
else at your hands?"

"Well, we're not holding up this rain any by talking," he returned gruffly.  "Get down and
we'll get inside.  You can stay here till morning."

"Oh, no!"

"Why not?"

"Just put me on the road for home and let me be going."

"This is my cabin.  I told you that."

"I can't stay here."

"This is my cabin.  I'm responsible for the safety of everyone that steps under my roof."

"I know, but I must go home.  They have most likely been searching the trails for me.  Father
would telephone"--she was desperate for excuses--"to Belle and learn I'd started home--and
the storm----"

He did not hesitate to cut her off: "Afraid of me, eh?"

The contempt and resentment in his words stirred her.  Without answering she sprang as well
as she could in her wet habit from the saddle and faced him, close enough almost to see into
his eyes in the darkness.  From the fireplace inside a gleam of light, from the blaze that
Hawk had started, piercing the tiny window sash shot across her face: "Does this look like
it?" she demanded, her eyes seeking his.  He was stubborn.  "Answer me!" she exclaimed in a
tone of a dictator.

"Then why don't you do what I ask you to do instead of giving me a story about Barb Doubleday
telephoning?" he demanded.  She winced at her mistake in urging an impossible thing.  She felt
when she made it, Laramie would not credit so wild an assertion.  Her father would not take
the trouble to telephone to save even a bunch of his steers from a storm, much less his daughter.
"But there may be others over there," Laramie added grimly, "that would."

The reference to the man he hated--Van Horn--was too plain to be passed over.  "Now," she returned,
as if to close--and standing her ground as she spoke, "have you said all the mean things you
can think of?"

He evaded her thrust.  "The wires are down a night like this, anyway," he objected.  "If you'd
be as honest with me as I am with you we'd get along without saying mean things."

"I am honest with you.  Can't you see that a woman can't always be as open in what she says
as a man?"

"What do I know about a woman?"

"But since you make everything hard for me I shall be open with you."

"Come inside then and say it."

"I couldn't be any wetter than I am and if I've got to say this to one man I won't say it to
two: You ask me to stay all night in your cabin as it I were a small boy--instead of what I am."

"You could take all the shooting irons on the place into your own room with you."

"I shouldn't need to.  But what would people say of me when they heard of it?  That I had stayed
here all night!  You know what they can do to a woman's reputation in this country--you know
how some evil tongues talk about Belle.  I would like to keep at least my reputation out of
this bitter war that is going on--can't you, won't you, understand?"

He was silent a moment.  "Come in to the fire, then," he said at length, "and we'll see what
we can do.  You've been on the wrong road all night.  There's no need of any secrets now on
anybody's part, I guess.  But I'd rather turn you over to ten thousand devils than to the man
you're going back to tonight."

"Surely," she gasped, "you don't mean my own father?"

"You know the man I mean," was all he answered.  Then he threw open the cabin door and stood
waiting for her to pass within.

CHAPTER XXVI

THE CRAZY WOMAN WINS

It would have been idle for Laramie to deny to himself, as she stepped without hesitation under
his roof, that he loved her; or that he could step in after her and close his door for her
and for him--even for an hour--against the storm and the world, without a thrill deeper than
he had ever felt.

He leaned his rifle against the cabin wall; a blanket had been hung completely over the window
and he let down two heavy bars across the door.  Kate, in front of the fire, followed him with
her eyes.  "Don't mind this," he said, noticing her look.  "The place is watched a good deal.
I couldn't afford too much of a surprise any time."

While he was searching for a lamp, her eyes ran quickly over the dark interior, lighted fitfully
as the driftwood, snapping on the stone hearth, flared at times into a blaze.  Kate herself,
despite the doubts and fears of her situation, was conscious of a strange feeling in being
under Laramie's roof--at one with him in so far as he could make her feel so.  Like a roll
of fleeting film, strange pictures flashed across her mind and she could not help thinking
more and more about the man and his stubborn isolation.

He had taken off his coat and was trying to light the lamp.  She looked narrowly at the face
illumined by the spluttering flare of the wick as he stood over it, looking down and adjusting
the flame; he seemed, she was thinking--for her at least--so easy to get along with--for everyone
else, so hard.

A pounding at the door gave her a start.  Hawk was returning from the barn where he had taken
the horses.  Laramie showed no surprise and walked over to lift the double bar only after he
had got the lamp to burn to suit him.  She felt startled again when Laramie in the simplest
way made the formidable outlaw, who now walked in, known to her.  The picture of him as he
swung roughly inside from the wild night was unforgettable.  Erect and with his piercing eyes
hollowed by illness, his impassive features made slender by suffering and framed by the striking
beard, Hawk seemed to Kate to confirm in his appearance every fantastic story she had ever
heard of him.

Not till after Laramie had urged him and Kate herself had joined in the plea, would he come
near her or near to the fire.

"A wet night and a blind trail do pretty well at mixing things up," observed Laramie.  "However,
we needn't make any further secrets.  Abe, here, has got it in his mind to head for a hospital
tonight.  You," he looked at Kate, "are heading for home.  I don't like either scheme very
much but I'm an innocent bystander.  We'll ride three together till the trails fork.  Then,"
he spoke again to Kate, "we'll put you on a sure trail for the ranch, and the two of us will
head into town.  It isn't the way I planned, but it's one way out."

"The sooner we get started the better," said Hawk, curtly.  The two men discussed for a moment
the trip; then Laramie and Hawk left the house for the barn and corral to get up horses.  Before
leaving, Laramie showed Kate how to drop the bars and cautioned her not to neglect to secure
the door.  "Some of this bunch Van Horn has got out wouldn't be very agreeable company."

"Surely they wouldn't harm me!"

"It would mean a nasty fight for us when we bring up the horses."

Kate secured the door.  Wet and uncomfortable but undismayed by the various turns of her predicament
she sat down to study the fire.  Her eyes wandered through the gloom to the dark corners of
the rough room and over the crude furnishings.

The long, slender snowshoes on the wall, the big beaded moccasins with them, the coiled lariats
hung on the pegs in company with old spurs; the bunk in the corner strewn with Indian blankets
from the far-off Spanish country, and overflowing with the skin of a grizzly--all brought to
mind and reflected an active life.  The firelight glinted the bright, bluish barrels of the
rifles on the rack, to Kate, almost sinisterly, for some of them must suggest a side of Laramie's
life she disliked to dwell on--yet she allowed herself to wonder which rifle he took when he
armed not for elk or grizzlies but for men.  And then at the side of the fireplace she saw
fastened on the rough wall a faded card photograph of a young woman--almost a girl.  It was
simply framed--Kate wondered whether it might be his mother.  Over the crude wooden frame was
hung an old rosary, the crucifix depending from the picture.  The beads were black and worn
by use as if they had slipped many times through girlish fingers.

She had a long time to let her thoughts run.  The two men were not soon back and she was beginning
to wonder what might have happened, when, standing at the door to listen, she heard noises
outside and Laramie's voice.  She let him in at once.  "You didn't have the door barred," he
said, suspiciously.

"Oh, yes, but I heard you speak."

He was alone.  "We're ready," he said.  "No dry clothes for you, but we can't help it."

She protested she did not mind the wet.  Hawk in the saddle was waiting with their horses.
Rain was still falling and with the persistent certainty of a mountain storm.  Kate, mounting
with Laramie's help, got her lines into her hands.  "It's pretty dark," he said, standing at
her stirrup.  "We'll have to ride slow.  I go first, Hawk next, then you; if our horses can
make the trail yours likely can.  I don't think we'll meet anybody, but if we do it's better
to know now what to do.  If you hear any talk that sounds like trouble, push out of the line
as quick as you can and throw yourself flat on the ground.  Stay there till you don't hear
any more shooting, but hang on to your lines so you don't lose your horse.

"The only other trouble might be your getting lost from us." He spoke slowly as if thinking.
"That must depend a good deal on you.  Keep as close as you can.  Can you whistle?"  Kate thought
she could.  "If you can't make us hear," he continued, "shoot--have you got a pistol?"  She
had none.  He brought her a double action revolver from the cabin and showed her how it worked.
"Don't use it unless you have to.  It might be heard by more than us."

Kate stuck the revolver under her wet belt.  "Why couldn't I ride with you?" she asked.

"There's more danger riding ahead."

"No more for me than for you."

"I wouldn't say that.  But if you want to try it, all right.  Keep close.  Don't be afraid
of bumping me--and Hawk can follow us."

There was nothing in the night to encourage heading into it.  That men could find their way
with every possibility of landmark and sight blotted out and nothing of sound above the downpour
except the tumultuous roar of the Turkey which they were following, was to Kate a mystery of
mysteries.  Even the lightning soon deserted them.  Their pace was halted by washouts, obstructed
by debris in the trail.  In places, the creek running bank-full, backed up over their path.

At times, Laramie halting his companions, rode slowly ahead, sounding out the overflows and
choosing the footing.  Where streamlets poured over rock outcroppings the horses slipped. 
Frequently to get his bearings, Laramie felt his way forward by reaching for trees and scraped
his knees against them as he pushed his horse close.  And in spite of everything to confuse,
intimidate and hold them back, they slipped and floundered on their way, until quite suddenly
a new roar from out of the impenetrable dark struck their ears.

Laramie halted their party, and the three in silence, listened. "That," said Laramie, after
a moment, to Hawk, "sounds like the Crazy Woman."

He went ahead to investigate.  He was gone a long time, yet he groped half a mile down the
road and made his way back to his companions without a signal.  He was on foot.  "We're all
right," was the report he brought, "it's a little dryer ahead.  While I'm down," he said to
Kate, "I'll try your cinches.  It's a mean night."

"Did you ever see such a night?" she echoed, shuddering.

"Plenty of 'em," returned Laramie.  "Once we cross the creek the going will be better."

Of the going between them and the creek, Laramie prudently said nothing.  It was the worst
of the journey.  Two stretches were filled with backwater.  Across these they cautiously waded
and swam the horses.  When they gained high ground adjoining the creek, Kate breathed more
freely.  There was a halt for reconnaissance.  For this, Laramie and Hawk, after placing Kate
where she would be safe whether they should come back or not, went forward together.

The splashing and floundering of their horses as the two left her side, was gradually lost
in the roar of the night and she was alone in the darkness.  They were gone a good while but
Kate had enough of confused and conflicting thought to occupy her reflections.  After a long
interval the report of a Colt's struck her anxious ear.  She swallowed in sudden fear to listen
more keenly.  If there were a fight it would be followed by another report and more.  With
her heart beating fast she listened, but there was no successor to the single shot and, calming
somewhat, she speculated on just what it might mean.  Again she waited with such patience as
she could until the measured splash of a horse's feet nearing her through the shallow water
announced someone's approach.  Laramie was back and alone.

Almost anybody in the world would have been welcome at such a juncture. He called and she answered
quickly, but he brought unwelcome news--the little bridge that spanned the creek at this point
was out.

"We can't get across, can we?" she exclaimed in disappointment.

"We can swim the creek if you're game for it."

"Could we possibly get across?"

"If I didn't expect to get across I'd sure never try it.  It'll be a wet crossing."

"I couldn't be wetter."

"Hawk asked if you could swim."

"I can't."

"I told him I didn't suppose you could."

"Are we all to go together?"

"He's over now.  He signaled a minute ago.  I told him I'd get you across if he'd get you out.
It's close to daybreak.  Better take off your coat."

While he strapped her coat to the saddle, she lightened and freed herself as much as possible,
disengaged, as he directed, her feet from the stirrups, and they started for the creek.  At
the point he had chosen for the plunge, he gave her a few admonitions, chiefly to the effect
of doing nothing except to cling to her seat in getting into the flood and getting out.  Just
as her horse poised beside Laramie's a wave of dread swept over her.  It was very literally
a plunge into the dark.  "Are you afraid?" he asked, divining her feeling.

Pride dictated her answer: "No," she said stoutly.  "Though, of course," she added with an
attempt at lightness, "I'd prefer to cross on a bridge."

"All in getting used to it, I suppose.  I guess I've crossed here a hundred times before there
was any bridge.  Don't get scared if your head goes under water when your horse jumps in. 
The bank here is a little high, but it's clean jumping.  Say when you're ready."

"I'm ready."

"Go!"

With his hand on her bridle, he spoke loudly and sharply, kicked her horse with one foot and
punched his own horse with the other at the same time.  The next instant, gripped by an overpowering
fear, and breathless, Kate felt herself jerked into the air, then she plunged headlong forward
and sank into the boiling flood.  Down, down she went, her ears swooning with water, mouth
and eyes tight shut, and moving she knew not where or how until her head rose out of the flood
and a voice yelled above the tumult: "You're all right!  Horse's doing fine.  Hang on!"

Then she was conscious of a hand clutching her upper arm, a hand so strong her flesh winced
within its grip.  And she could feel the powerful strokes of her horse as he panted and swam
under her.

Above the terrifying swirl of the waters, carrying in the hardly distinguishable light of the
breaking day, a mass of debris that swept about the two riders, the only sound was the hard
breathing of the horses and a shout repeated by Laramie, until at last it was answered by Hawk
somewhere in the darkness ahead.

Urging the horses to their task, Laramie guided them to where Kate could make out portions
of the creek bank.  She could realize how fast they were being carried down stream by the wild
sweep of the current. Trees flashed past her like phantoms, as if the bank were mad instead
of the creek.  It seemed impossible she could ever make the bank, now very near, and get up
out of the water; only Laramie's hand locked firm now in her horse's mane, his strong voice
as he urged the horses or called to Hawk, gave her the slightest hope of coming out alive.

Laramie cried to her to duck as a cottonwood leaning over the water almost tore her cap and
hair from her head.  The next instant the cottonwood was gone and, looking ahead, she saw a
horseman on a slope in the bank, his own horse half submerged.  They had reached one of several
old fords.  Here the two men had purposed to get Kate ashore. But she did not know that this
was the last of the ford crossings for a mile--the only shelving bank--nor why Laramie made
such superhuman efforts to head her horse toward Hawk, to get to where the horse could ground
his feet.  Hawk, in an effort to catch Kate's bridle, spurred down to them till his own horse
was afloat.  Kate's horse struggled desperately, lost headway and was swept below the ford
opening.  The two men with shouts, curses and entreaties, guiding their own horses, urged the
hapless beast to greater effort; it was evident he could not reach the ford.

"The roan can't make it," shouted Hawk.  "Crowd him up to the ledge where I can get hold of her."

Hawk, reining his horse hastily about, got him back up the shelving ford, spurred down the
bank to where Kate, despite Laramie's efforts, was being driven by the sweep of the water and
sprang from his horse. Where Kate's horse struggled at that moment the creek bank rose vertically
above the peak of the flood.  Deep water gave the horse no chance for a foothold and it swam
helplessly.  Hawk, running along the ledge, awaited his chance.  It came at a moment that Laramie
succeeded in crowding the roan to the bank.  Hawk saw the opportunity and held his hand out
to Kate:

"Reach up!" he shouted.

"Give him both hands!" cried Laramie, punching and pushing her horse against the bank.  As
Kate swept along, her hands upstretched, Hawk caught her wrists and, bracing himself in the
slipping earth, dragged her up and out of the saddle.  The roan, with Laramie's hand on his
bridle, swept on downstream.  The clay bank, under the strain of the double load, gave under
Hawk's feet.  But without releasing Kate's hands he threw himself flat and, matching his dead
weight against the chance of being dragged in, caught her with one arm and flung the other
backward into the dark.  A clump of willow shoots clutched in his sinewy fingers gave him a
stay and, putting forth all his strength, he drew Kate slowly up.  She scrambled across his
prostrate body to safety.

The force of the gnawing current had already undercut the soft clay. The next instant the whole
bank began to sink.  Hawk shouted to Kate to run.  She saw him struggling in the crumbling
earth.  Crying out in her excitement she stretched her hands toward him.  He waved her back.
As he did so, a great section of the bank on which he was struggling broke, and in the big,
soft splash, Hawk went into the creek.

CHAPTER XXVII

KATE DEFIES

The instant he saw Kate in Hawk's keeping, Laramie rode down with the flood, looking sharply
for a chance to get out the two horses; when finally he did get them ashore he was spent. 
Leading Kate's horse, he made his way up-creek through the willows to where she should be with
Hawk.

Hawk's horse he found browsing in the heavy wet grass at the old ford. Neither Kate nor Hawk
were in sight.  Laramie walked down to the water's edge where Hawk had pulled her out.  Familiar
with the meander of the bank below the ford, he saw what had happened.  The bank, under-cut,
had been swallowed by the flood.  Laramie ran down stream and came suddenly on Kate standing
alone on a rock jutting out above the torrent.

In the uncertain light of the gray morning he saw her anxious face. She explained what had
happened.  Laramie showed no alarm.  "I guess Abe will handle himself," he said.

"Can't we do anything to help him?"

"I'll put you on your trail, then I'll ride down the creek and look for him.  He'll make it
if his strength doesn't give out."

Laramie took Kate up the creek and, riding through the hills, brought her, unexpectedly, out
on a trail within sight of her father's ranch-house hardly three miles away.  He pointed to
a break heading from the creek.  "You can follow that draw almost to the house," he explained.
Then, reining about, he wheeled his horse to take the back trail.  "Are you going to run away
without giving me a chance to thank you?" she exclaimed, with a feminine touch of surprise.

"There's a gate near the head of the draw where you can get through the wire," he rejoined
stubbornly.

"I can't see how I can ever repay you for what you've done tonight," she persisted.

He was coldly uncompromising.  "You needn't bother about any pay, if that's what you call it."

Skilfully she drew her horse a step closer to him.  "What shall I call it?" she asked innocently,
"debt, obligation?  I owe you a lot, ever so much to me--my life."

"I've done no more for you than I've done for less than a human being," he returned impatiently.

"I'm sure that's so.  But human beings," she added, with a touch of gentle good-nature, "are
supposed to have more feeling than cows or steers, you know."

"I never had a cow or a steer call me names," he retorted rudely.

"If you weren't a human being you wouldn't mind being called names; you wouldn't be so angry
with me, either."

"I'm not angry," he said resentfully.  His very helplessness in her hands pricked her conscience
at the moment that it restored her supremacy.  His strength might menace others--she at least
had nothing to fear from it.

"Do you know," she exclaimed, shaking off for the moment all restraint, "what I'd like to do?"

He looked at her surprised.

"I'd like to ride back this minute with you and help find Abe Hawk.  I know I mustn't," she
went on as he listened.  "But I'd like to," she persisted hurriedly.  And then, afraid of herself
more than of him, she repressed a quick "good-by" and, without giving him time to answer, galloped
away.

She reached the ranch-house without further difficulty.  No one was stirring.  She stopped
at the corral and turned in her horse and, walking awkwardly on her swollen ankle to the kitchen,
built a fire, warmed herself as best she could and went to her room.  By the time her father
was stirring, Kate, under her coverlets, quite exhausted, was fast asleep.

It was broad day when she woke.  Through an open window, she saw sullen gray clouds still rolling
down from the northwest, but between them the sun shot out at ragged intervals--the storm had
broken.  Walking gingerly from her room, on her lame foot, she found the house empty. Her father,
Kelly told her, had gone out early, and she sat down to a late breakfast glad to be undisturbed
in her thoughts.  Her mind was still in a confusion of opinions; some, long-cherished being
crowded, so to say, to the wall; others, more than once rejected, growing bolder.  It was in
this mental condition that her seclusion was invaded by Van Horn.

He swept off his hat with a show of spirits.  "Just heard you'd got home."  He sat down with
her at the table.  "Everybody thought you stayed in town last night.  Got lost, eh?"

Kate raised her coffee cup non-committally.  "For awhile," she murmured between sips.

"What time did you get here?"

"I was so glad to get to bed I never looked at my watch."  Again she regarded him, quite innocently,
over the rim of her cup.  "Did anybody lose any stock?"

He did not abandon his inquisition willingly, but each time he asked a question, Kate parried
and asked one in turn.  He gave up without having gained any information she meant to withhold.

It was not hard to keep him in good humor; indeed, it was rather too easy.  He pushed back
his chair, crossed his legs, talked of a strong cattle market for the fall and spoke of Hawk
and the hunt he was keeping up for him.  "They had a story around--or some of the boys had
the idea--that his friends would pick a wet night like last night to take him into town."

"Is he still in the country?"

"Sure he is.  Say, Kate," he changed his attitude as lightly as he did his subject--uncrossed
his legs, squared himself in his chair and threw his elbows on the table.

She met the new disposition with a tone of prudent reserve: "What is it?"

"When are you going to do something for a lonesome old scout?" he asked bluntly.

With as little concern as possible, she put down her knife and fork, and, with her hands seeking
her napkin, looked at him.  "What do you mean?" she returned collectedly, "by 'doing something'?"

"Marry me."

"Never."

The passage was disconcertingly quick.  Van Horn, thrown quite aback, remonstrated.  His discomfiture
was so undisguised that Kate was embarrassed.  The next moment he was very angry.  "If that's
the case," he blurted out, "what's the use o' my sticking around here fighting your battles?"

"You're not fighting my battles."

"Maybe you don't call 'em your father's, either," he exclaimed scornfully.

"They're your own battles," declared Kate.  "You know that as well as I do."

"All the same, your father gets the benefit of them," he continued hotly.

"I wish to heaven he had kept out of them."

Van Horn eyed her sharply.  His face reflected his sarcasm.  "Of course, you needn't worry,"
he grinned, with implication.  "They wouldn't steal your horse even if you do always leave
it in Kitchen's barn; the Falling Wall bunch think too much of you for that."

Surprised as she was at this outbreak, Kate kept her head.  "There are some of the rustlers
I'd trust as far as I would some of the raiders," she rejoined coolly.

"Why don't you say Jim Laramie," he exclaimed harshly.

"Jim Laramie," she returned defiantly, "is not the only one."

"He'll be the 'only one' after our next clean-up in the Falling Wall. And he won't be 'one'
if he doesn't change his tune."

Kate's eyes were snapping fire.  "Take care that next time the Falling Wall doesn't clean you
up," she said bitingly.

He snorted.  "I mean it," she exclaimed.  "Next time you'll need to look out for yourself."

He bolted from his chair.  "That's the first time I ever heard anybody on this ranch take sides
with the men that's robbing it--or carry a threat to this ranchhouse for rustlers."

"Call it whatever you please, you won't change my opinion of you.  But, of course, I'm only
a woman and don't know anything."

"I'm thinking you know a whole lot more than you let on," he declared.

"Anyway, I wish you'd leave this ranch out of the rest of it.  If you keep on 'cleaning up,'
as you call it, you'll go farther and fare worse."

He brought down his fist.  "Not until I've cleaned out two more pups, anyway!  Now, look here,
Kate," he went on, "you may be fooling about this marrying, but you can bet I'm not."

"Well, you can bet I'm not," she returned, echoing his pert slang sharply.

"Who's the man?"  He flung the question at her point-blank.

If she flushed the least bit it was with anger at his rudeness.  "There isn't any man, and
there isn't going to be any--so please never talk again about my marrying you or anybody else."

She rose and left the table.  He jumped to intercept her and tried to catch her hands.  She
let him see she was not in the least afraid and as he confronted her, she faced him without
a tremor.  "Let me pass!" She fairly snapped out the words.

Van Horn, without moving, broke into a boisterous laugh.  Kelly walked in just then from the
kitchen and Van Horn, losing none of his malevolence, did stand aside.

"All right," he said, "--this time."

CHAPTER XXVIII

A DIFFICULT RESOLVE

For two days Kate burned in feverish reaction from her exposure, wretched in mind and body.
Her only effort in that time was to get down to the corral and see that Bradley, acting as
barn boy, should do something for her cut and bruised pony.

Her father was still in Medicine Bend, and Van Horn, much to her relief, had disappeared. 
When she left her bed she spent the morning trying to rehabilitate her riding suit.  The task
called for all her ingenuity and she was still in the kitchen working on it late in the afternoon
when Bradley came in.

He had no sooner sat down by the door to report to Kate at his ease, than Kelly interrupted
him with a call for wood.  Even after he had filled the box, Kelly warned him he would have
to split more next morning to get a supply ahead.

"Easy, Kelly," remonstrated Bradley, in his deeply tremulous voice. "Easy.  I can't split no
wood t'morrow mornin', not for nobody."

"Why not?"

"Got to go to town."

"What for?"

Bradley declined to answer, but Kelly, persistent, bored into his evasiveness until Kate tired
at the discussion: "Tell him what you're going for and be done with it," she said tartly. 
The reaction of three days had not left her own nerves unaffected; she admitted to herself
she was cross.

Bradley, taken aback by this unexpected assault, still tried to temporize.  Kate refused to
countenance it.  When he saw he was in for it, he appealed to her generosity: "It'd be most
's much 's my job's worth if they knew here what I'm goin' to town tomorrow f'r."

"If that's all," said Kate, to reassure the old man, "I'll stand between you and losing your job."

Bradley drew his stubby chin and shabby beard in and threw his voice down into his throat:
"D' y' mean that?  Then don't say nothin', you and Kelly.  Least said, soonest mended.  I'm
goin' t' town t'morrow t' see the biggest funeral ever pulled off in Sleepy Cat," he announced
with bleary dignity.

"What do you mean--whose funeral?" demanded Kate, looking at him suddenly.

"Abe Hawk's.  It's goin' t' be t'morrow er next day."

If the old man had meant to stupefy his questioner, he could not better have succeeded.  Kate
turned deathly white.  She bent over the table and busied herself with her ironing.  Bradley,
pleased with his confidence safely made, talked on.  He found a pride in talking to Kate, with
Kelly in and out of the room, and launched into unrestrained eulogies of the famed rustler,
always the friend of the poor man, once king of the great north range itself.

"It's a pity," murmured Kate, when she felt she must say something, "that he ever went wrong."

Bradley had a point to offer even on that.  "It's a pity they ever blacklisted him; that was
Stone's get-up.  And Stone, when I was sheriff, was the biggest thief in the county an' the
county was four times as big then as it is now--that's 'tween you 'n' me."

"Were you ever sheriff, Bill?"

"You won't believe it, but it's so--dash me 'n' dash drunkards one and all."

"I hear, though," returned Kate, only because in her distress of mind she could think of nothing
else to say, "that Tom Stone has stopped drinking."

"That man," was Bradley's retort, and he kept his tremulous voice still far down in his throat,
"is mean enough to do any d--d thing."

"You used to be sheriff?"

"Yes.  And when I was sheriff, Kate, I found out it was better to trust an honest man turned
thief than a thief turned honest man."

Kate, listening to his halting maunderings, hardly heeded them.  She heard in her troubled
ears the rush of mad waters; phantom voices cracked again in pistoled oaths at the horses,
the fear of sudden death clutched at her heart, and in the dreadful dark a powerful arm caught
her again and drew her, helpless, out of an engulfing flood.

She got out of doors.  The sunshine, clear and calm, belied the possibility of a night such
as Bradley's words had summoned.  "Dead," she kept saying to herself.  Laramie had been sure
he would get out of the creek.  What could it mean?

She went back to the kitchen where Bradley, eating supper, had switched from his long-winded
topic.  Kate had to question him: "What was the matter with Abe?  When did he die?" she asked,
as unconcernedly as she could.

There was little satisfaction in Bradley's slow, formal answer: "Some's got it one way and
some's got it another, Kate.  I can't rightly say what ailded him or when he died 'n' I guess
nobody else can, f'r sure. Some says he got shot; some says he was drownded 'a' las' Tuesday
night in the Crazy Woman; some says they's been a fight nobody's heard of yit, 't' all.  The
only man that knows for sure--if he does know--is the man that brought him into Sleepy Cat
'n' if he knows he won't tell."  He held out his big enameled cup.  "Kelly, gi' me jus' a squirt
o' coffee, will y'?"

Kate, on nettles, waited to hear who had brought Hawk in.  Bradley would not volunteer the
name.  Some deference was due him as the purveyor of the big news, and he meant that anyone
curious of detail should do the asking.  Kate, realizing this, framed with reluctance the question
he was waiting for: "Who brought Abe in?"

Even so, she knew there would be but one answer.  Bradley gulped another mouthful of scalding
coffee and set down his cup.  "Jim Laramie," he answered laconically.

She said to herself that Hawk had never got out of the creek; that he had drowned miserably
in the flood.  She tortured herself with conjecture as to exactly what had happened.  And night
brought no relief.  Sleepless, she tossed, marveling at how close his death had come home to
her.  Every scrap of the meager news added to what she already knew--pointed to what she most
feared.

She lay propped up on her pillows and looked through the open window out on the glittering
stars.  Strange constellations passed in brilliant procession before her eyes.  And while she
lay thus reflecting and revolving in her mind the loneliness and unhappiness of her surroundings,
a startling suggestion far removed from these doubts offered itself to her mind.  Repelled
at first, it came back as if demanding acceptance.  And not until after she had promised herself
she would consider it, did her thoughts give her any peace.  She fell into an uneasy slumber
and woke with day barely breaking; but without an instant's delay she dressed and slipped from
her room out to the barn.

Forehanded as she had been in getting an early start, Bradley was already stirring.  Pail in
hand, the old man, standing in front of the feed bin, stared at Kate speechless as she walked
in on him.

"Who's sick?" he demanded after a moment.

"Nobody, Bill.  I'm going to town with you, that's all."

"With me?"

She half laughed at herself and at his surprise.  "I mean, I'm for town early.  Get up a pony
for me--Spider Legs will do."

Born of long-forgotten experience in waiting for women, Bill Bradley, as Kate walked away,
put in a caveat: "I'm headin' out jus' soon's I c'n get breakfast."

"I, too, Bill.  I'll be across the divide before you are."

Curiosity would not down: "What y' goin' t' town f'r?" he called.

Turning half around, Kate, with a little shrug, paused.  She would not be ungracious: "To pick
up a few things," she answered unconcernedly.

Bill, not satisfied, felt obliged to desist.  "Startin' airly," was his only grumble.  Had
he known what possibilities for that day had lodged themselves in Kate's mind, he would not
have been able to slip Spider Legs' bridle over his ears.  But his business being only to get
up the horse, he discharged it with shaky fidelity and for himself started with high expectations
for town.  Had he been given to speculating on the variableness of woman, he might have found
a text in Spider Legs' standing for hours after he was made ready.  And in the end his mistress
unsaddled him and turned him back into the corral.

The truth was, Kate had been seized with cruel fits of doubt and for a long time could not
decide whether she ought to go to town or not.  But as often as she gave up the idea of going,
a heart-strong impulse pleaded against her uneasy restraint.  She felt she must go.

CHAPTER XXIX

HORSEHEAD PASS

Bradley had not been able to tell her just when the funeral was set for.  But it surged in
Kate's heart that after what Abe Hawk had done for her, to let the poor, bullet-torn, neglected
body be put into the ground without some effort to pay a tribute of gratitude to the man that
had once animated it, would be on her part fearfully cold.

The difficulties of the situation were many.  She feared the anger of her father, and owed
his feelings something as well.  But every time she decided she ought to stay at home, the
pricking at her heart grew keener.  In the end, her feelings overrode her restraint.  She resolved
at least to go to town.  The funeral might have already taken place--it would be a relief even
to learn more about his death.

Late in the afternoon, she got Spider Legs up again, saddled him and, telling Kelly she might
not be back that night, rode away.

It was dark by the time she reached town and leaving her horse with McAlpin she crossed the
street from the barn and walked hurriedly around the corner to Belle's.  The front door stood
open and the red-shaded lamp burned low on the dining-room table.

Tapping on the screen door, Kate, without waiting for Belle to answer, opened it and went in.
There was no light in the living-room and the portières were drawn.  She walked down the hall
to the dining-room, where she laid down her gloves and took off her coat and hat. Smoothing
her hair, she knocked on the door of Belle's room, but got no answer.  Conjecturing that she
had gone out on an errand, Kate sat down in a rocking chair and, taking a newspaper from the
table, tried to read.

Her thoughts soon blurred the print.  She read on only to think of what had brought her so
irresistibly to town and to wonder what she should hear now that she had come.

After some struggle to concentrate, she tossed the paper aside to ask herself why Belle did
not return, and, being tense, began without realizing it, to rock softly.  Her eyes naturally
turned to the familiar lamp.  Its somber paper shade threw the light in a circle on the table,
leaving the room in the heavy shadows of its figured pattern.  Kate became all at once conscious
of the utter silence, and impatient for Belle's return, got up and walked through the dark
hall toward the front door.

Passing the living-room portières, she pushed open the screen door and stepped out on the porch.
There she stood for a moment at the top of the steps looking at the stars.  Lights here and
there burned in neighboring cottage windows.  No wind stirred.  The street and the town were
as still as the night.  After some minutes, Kate descended the steps, opened the gate, leaving
it to close with a click behind her, and walked to the corner of Main Street.  It looked dark.
The stores were closed.  From the saloon windows spotty lights shot at intervals across the
upper street, but these only made the darkened store fronts blacker and revealed the nakedness
and desertion of the street itself. Not a man, much less a woman, could she see anywhere moving.

Either the silence, or the night, or her long wait changed her impatience into a feeling of
loneliness.  She turned back toward the cottage gate.  She had not noticed before how very
dark the side street was.  Reaching the gate she hesitated, pushed it open and then stopped,
conscious of a curious repugnance to entering the house.

Her feeling refused to explain itself.  Through the screen she could see the lamp still burning
on the dining-room table.  Things appeared just as she had left them, yet she did not want
to go in.  But, dismissing the qualm, she walked up the steps, crossed the narrow porch, opened
the screen door and, stepping inside, closed it after her.

This time that she passed the living-room she noticed the portières were partly open.  Both
times she had passed before, she felt sure, they had been closed.

Kate sat down in the dining-room and looked suspiciously back at the portières.  She was already
sorry she had come into the house, for the silence and her aloneness added to the conviction
fast stealing over her that someone must be in the dark living-room.

Once entertained, the suspicion became insupportable.  Her ears were pitched to a painful intensity
of listening and her eyes were fastened immovably on the motionless curtains.

She carried a ranchwoman's revolver and, putting her hand on it, she rose, stepped close to
the door of Belle's room--into which she could retreat--and, with one hand on the knob, called
sharply toward the living-room: "Who's there?"

Not a sound answered her.

"Who is in the living-room?" she demanded again.  This time, after a moment's delay, she heard
something move in the darkness, then a man's step and Laramie stood out between the portières.

Except for a fatigued look as he rested one hand on the portière and the other on his hip,
he appeared quite as she had last seen him.  "Are you calling me?" he asked.

"Yes," she responded tartly.  "Why didn't you answer?"

"I didn't know who you were speaking to at first.  I've been here all the evening.  I didn't
know you were in town till I saw your hat on the table a few minutes ago."

"Where is Belle?" asked Kate, still on edge.

"She went over to Mrs. Kitchen's."

"When will she be back?"

He seemed to take no offense at her peremptory tone.  "She said she wouldn't be gone a great
while.  But," he added, with his customary deliberation, "all the same, I wouldn't be surprised
if she stayed over pretty late--or even all night."

This was not just what Kate wanted to hear.  "Why didn't you say something when I first came
in?" she asked, her suspicion reflected in her voice.

He did not seem nonplused but he answered slowly: "I heard someone come in.  I didn't pay much
attention, that's about the truth."

"What are you doing in there in the dark?"

He was provokingly deliberate in answering.  "You probably haven't heard about Abe Hawk?"

Her manner changed instantly and her voice sank.  "Is it true that he is dead?"

"Yes."

"He didn't drown that morning, did he?" she asked eagerly anxious. "You thought he could get
out--what happened?"

"He got out of the creek.  But he strained his wounds--they opened.  I wasn't much of a surgeon.
I got him to the hospital--he died there.  I had no place to take him then.  I wouldn't leave
him there alone. Belle said I might bring him here.  I'm spending my last night with him."

"You're not trying to spare me, are you?" she asked, unsteadily.  "He really did get out of
the creek?"

"He did get out."

She spoke again brokenly: "He saved my life."

"Well," remarked Laramie, meditating, "he wouldn't ask anything much for that.  Do you mind
if I smoke?"

"Not a bit."

"I'm kind of nervous tonight," he confessed simply.  Then he crossed the room, rested his elbow
on the mantelpiece and made ready a cigarette.  "I wonder," he said, "if I could ask you a
question?"

"What is it?"

"You always act kind of queer with me.  Why is it?  You've never been the way you were the
first day we met.  Haven't I always been square with you?"

She hesitated but she answered honestly: "You always have."

"Then why are you so different?"

"I've made that confession once.  I was acting a part that day."

"No, I can't figure it in that way.  That day you were acting natural. Why can't you be like
that again."

"But, Mr. Laramie----"

"No--Jim."

"But----"

"Every time you call me Mr. Laramie I'm looking around for a gentleman. Why can't you be the
way you were the first time?"

She realized his eyes were on her, demanding the truth--and his eyes were uncomfortably steady
as she had reason to know.  "If I spoke I should hurt your feelings," she urged, summoning
all her courage.  "You know as well as I do that the first time I met you I didn't know who
you were."

He did not seem much disconcerted, except that he tossed away the unlighted cigarette.  "You
don't know now," was his only comment.

"I can't help knowing what is said about you--you and your friends."

He made an impatient gesture.  "That gives you no clue to me."

"What are people to believe when such stories are public property?"

"Only what they know to be true."

"How are they to find out what is true?"

"By going straight to the person most concerned in the stories."

"Would you honestly expect a young woman to go to work and investigate all the charges against
men she hears in Sleepy Cat?"

"We are talking now about the charges against one man--against me.  I want to give you an instance:

"I suppose there's been a good many hard words over your way about my keeping Abe Hawk out
of the hands of your people.  Because I did shelter him--you know how--they've blackened my
name here at Sleepy Cat and down at Medicine Bend.  A man doesn't have to approve all another
man does, to befriend him when he's down and a bunch of men--not as good as he--set out to
finish him.  I haven't got any apologies to make to anybody for protecting Abe when he was
wounded--and if he wasn't wounded, no man would talk any kind of protection to him.  But you've
been fed up with stories about it--I know that--so," he added grimly, "I'm going to tell you
one story more.

"I grew up in this country when the mining fever was on--everybody plumb crazy in the rush
for the Horsehead Camp in the Falling Wall country.  One winter five hundred men in tents were
hanging around Sleepy Cat waiting for the first thaw, to get up to the camp.  That's when I
got acquainted with Abe Hawk.  Abe was carrying the mails to the mines.  He hadn't a red cent
in the world.  My father had just died; I was a green kid with a pocketful of money.  Abe didn't
teach me any bad habits--I didn't need any teacher.  One night we were sitting next to each
other, with Harry Tenison dealing faro.

"I heard Abe was going up over the pass to Horsehead with the Christmas bag.  The few miners
that got in the fall before had hung up a fat purse for their Christmas mail and Abe needed
the money.  He was the only man with the crazy nerve to try such a thing.  And there were twenty
men, with all kinds of money, crowding him to take them along: to beat the bunch in might mean
a million dollar strike to any tenderfoot in Sleepy Cat.
