"'I wandered through the sprouting grass,'" answered the hemp-dresser in a slightly hoarse
but terrible voice. "You must be jesting, my poor friends, singing us such time-worn songs.
You see very well that we can stop you at the first word."

     "'She was a prince's daughter...'"

"'Right gladly would she wed,'" answered the hemp-dresser. "Come, move on to the next; we know
that a little too well."

The Grave-digger: "How do you like this one?--

     "'As I was journeying home from Nantes.'"

The Hemp-dresser:

     "'Weary, oh, weary, was I, was I.'"

"That dates from my grandmother's time. Let's have another."

 The Grave-digger:

The Hemp-dresser:

 But everybody was pushing and shoving so hard, and there was so much playful
pride in this display of muscular strength, that the results might well have been serious,
although they did not appear so across the laughs and songs. The poor old hemp-dresser, fighting
like a lion, was pinned to the wall and squeezed by the crowd until his breath almost left
him. More than one champion was upset and trodden under foot involuntarily; more than one hand,
jammed against the spit, was covered with blood. These games are dangerous, and latterly the
accidents have been so severe that our peasants have determined to allow the ceremony of the
favors to fall into disuse; I believe we saw the last at the marriage of François Meillant,

 The square head-dresses upheld the cloth so evenly that it was impossible
to discern the contour of a brow outlined by its folds.

After ten minutes' hesitation, Germain shut his eyes, commended his soul to God, and stretched
out the wand at random. It touched the forehead of little Marie, who cast the cloth from her,
and shouted with triumph. Then it was his right to kiss her, and lifting her in his strong
arms, he bore her to the middle of the room, where together they opened the dance, which lasted
until two in the morning. The company separated to meet again at eight. As many people had
come from the country round, and as there were not beds enough for everybody, each of the village
maidens took to her bed two or three other girls, while the men spread themselves pell-mell
on the hay in the barn-loft. You can imagine well that they had little sleep, for they did
nothing but wrestle and joke, and tell foolish stories. Properly, there were three sleepless
nights at weddings, and these we cannot regret.

At the time appointed for departure, when they had partaken of milk-soup, seasoned with a strong
dose of pepper to stimulate the appetite,--for the wedding-feast gave promise of great bounty,--the
guests assembled in the farm-yard. Since our parish had been abolished, we had to go half a

There was a crowd at the door of the town hall and another at the church to see the pretty
bride. Why should we not tell about her dress? it became her so well. Her muslin cap, without
spot and covered with embroidery, had lappets trimmed with lace. At that time peasant women
never allowed a single lock to be seen, and, although they conceal beneath their caps splendid
coils of hair tied up with tape to hold the coif in place, even to-day it would be thought
a scandal and a shame for them to show themselves bareheaded to men. Nowadays, however, they
allow a slender braid to appear over their foreheads, and this improves their appearance very
much. Her was not be afraid knees what take i had of exemptions as a tribunals might wear if his

 Besides, I believe that it is practised in all the provinces, and does

Just as the ceremony of the wedding favors is a symbol that the heart and home of the bride
are won, that of the cabbage is a symbol of the fruit-fulness of marriage. When breakfast is
over on the day after the wedding, this fantastic representation begins. Originally of Gallic
derivation, it has passed through primitive Christianity, and little by little it has become
a kind of mystery, or droll morality-play of the Middle Ages.

Two boys, the merriest and most intelligent of the company, disappear from breakfast, and after
costuming themselves, return escorted by dogs, children, and pistol-shots. They represent a
pair of beggars--husband and wife--dressed in rags. The husband is the filthier of the two;
it is vice which has brought him so low; the wife is unhappy and degraded only through the
misdeeds of her husband.
