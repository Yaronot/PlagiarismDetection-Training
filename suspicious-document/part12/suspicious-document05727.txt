PREFACE

This book, written for women who have no special knowledge of medicine, aims to answer the
questions which occur to them in the course of pregnancy. Directions for safeguarding their
health have been given in detail, and emphasis has been placed upon such measures as may serve
to prevent serious complications. Treatment of such conditions has not been discussed, as it
can be judiciously carried out only by a physician who has the opportunity to observe and study
the individual patient. Furthermore, if there is to be notable improvement in the management
of cases of childbirth, the appearance of untoward symptoms should not be awaited before consulting
a physician; on the contrary, prospective mothers must be taught that they should be under
competent medical supervision throughout pregnancy.
