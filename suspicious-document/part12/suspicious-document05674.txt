The obvious corollary to this proposition is that the constitutional worrier is likely to break
down under an amount of work which produces no such effect upon the average normal individual.

The only quarrel I have with the name neurasthenia is that it diverts attention from the real
condition oftenest to be treated, namely, the faulty mental tendency, and directs attention
to an assumed debility which may or may not exist. Misdirected energy, rather than weakness,
is the difficulty with one who is ready and anxious to walk miles to satisfy a doubt, or to
avoid crossing an open square, and who will climb a dozen flights of stairs rather than be
shut up in an elevator. Even the exhaustion that follows long attention to business is quite
as often due to worry and allied faulty mental habits as to the work itself. In most cases
the phobias, the doubts, and the scruples, instead of being the result of breakdown, must be
counted among its principal causes.

This is why simple rest and abstinence from work so often fail to accomplish the cure that
should follow if the exhaustion were due simply to overwork. In the "neurasthenic" rest from
work only redoubles the worries, the doubts and the scruples, and the obsession to improve
his time only adds to his nervous exhaustion. If a European trip is undertaken, the temperament
responsible for the original breakdown causes him to rush from gallery to gallery, from cathedral
to cathedral, so that no moment may be lost. Not infrequently it so happens that the patient
returns more jaded than ever.

The neurasthenic is not infrequently a confirmed obsessive, with all the faulty mental habits
of this temperament. If he cannot make up his mind it is not because he is tired, but because
this is his natural mental trend. If he drums, twitches, and walks the floor, these movements
are not always due to exhaustion, but are habits peculiar to the temperament, habits well worth
an effort to eliminate while in health, since they doubtless, through precluding bodily repose,
contribute their mite toward the very exhaustion of which they are supposed to be the result.
If he cannot sleep it is not simply because he is tired, but because he is so constituted that
he cannot bring himself to let go his hold on consciousness until he has straightened out his
tangles. If, in addition, one has the hypochondriacal tendency, he may worry himself into complete
wakefulness by the thought that he has already irreparably injured himself by missing something
of the mystic number, eight or nine, or whatever he may deem the number of hours' sleep essential
to health.

It is important that the overwrought business or professional man realize the importance of
undertaking no more than he can accomplish without fret and worry; the importance of taking
proper vacations before he is tired out; the importance of learning to divert his mind, while
he can still do so, into channels other than those connected with his business; above all,
the importance of cultivating the faculty of relaxing, and of dismissing doubts, indecisions
and fears. He must cultivate what my colleague Dr. Paul succinctly terms "the art of living
with yourself as you are." If he would "last out" he must learn to proceed with single mind
upon whatever work he undertakes, and with equal singleness of mind apply himself, out of hours,
to other occupation or diversion, preferably in the open air. For the most effective work,
as well as for peace of mind, it is essential that every thought of one's office be shut out
by other interests when there is no actual business requiring attention. 8. 11. Spark. 2. That his

Among the predisposing causes for nervous breakdown none is more potent than the inability
of the obsessive to adapt himself to change of plan, and to reconcile himself to criticism,
opposition, and the various annoyances incident to his occupation. Again, in this connection
the lines of Cowper are pertinent:

  "The modest, sensible and well-bred man
  Will not affront me, and no other can."

Pope, also, who is said not always to have followed his own good counsel, contributes a verse
which may serve a turn:

  "At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offense,
  That always shows great pride, or little sense."

The practice of such commonplace philosophy (which, to be effective, should be ready for immediate
use, not stored away for later reflection), together with training against faulty mental states
studied in these pages, will go far toward relieving the mental perturbation that unfits for
effective work, and contributes to "neurasthenia."

During an hour's delay, caused by the failure of another to keep an appointment, I formulated
the following maxim:

"These are the annoyances incident to my business; to fret when they occur means that I cannot
manage my business without friction."

This may not appeal to the reader, but for me it has proved as good an hour's work as I ever
did. Since that time, on the occurrence of similar sources of provocation, I have found it
necessary to go no farther than "These are the annoyances," to restore the needful balance.
When we allow our gorge to rise at ordinary sources of discomfort, it implies that we are prepared
only for our affairs to run with perfect smoothness. This represents the insistent idea carried
to an absurdity.

At the risk of losing caste with the critical I cannot forbear sharing with the reader an inelegant
maxim which has more than once prevented an access of rage upon the blunder of a subordinate:
"If he had our brains he'd have our job."

Spinoza says: "The powerlessness of man to govern and restrain his emotions I call servitude.
For a man who is controlled by his emotions is not his own master but is mastered by fortune,
under whose power he is often compelled, though he sees the better, to follow the worse." The
same philosopher in counselling self-restraint adds:

"The mind's power over the emotions consists, first, in the actual knowledge of the emotions."
Again: "An emotion which is a passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form a clear and
distinct idea of it." The meaning of this dictum I first realized on experiencing the magical
effect of the line of thought suggested by the delayed appointment.

Communion with Nature has a peculiarly soothing effect on tired and jangled nerves. My friend,
Dr. Harold Williams, tells me that among his main reliances for tired and overwrought women
are the reading of children's books, and working in the garden. Peterson thus advises his busy
patient:

"A small farm in a simple community would be for you an asset of immeasurable value from the
standpoint of health and spiritual rejuvenation. But true simplicity should be the rigorous
order of that country life. A chateau by the sea, with a corps of gardeners, a retinue of servants,
and yachts and automobiles, would prove a disastrous expedient.
