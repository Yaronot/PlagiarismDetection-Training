PREFACE

Although in the present story a boy plays the principal part, and encounters many adventures
by land and sea, a woman is the real heroine, and the part she played demanded an amount of
nerve and courage fully equal to that necessary for those who take part in active warfare.
Boys are rather apt to think, mistakenly, that their sex has a monopoly of courage, but I believe
that in moments of great peril women are to the full as brave and as collected as men. Indeed,
my own somewhat extensive experience leads me to go even further, and to assert that among
a civil population, untrained to arms, the average woman is cooler and more courageous than
the average man. Women are nervous about little matters; they may be frightened at a mouse
or at a spider; but in the presence of real danger, when shells are bursting in the streets,
and rifle bullets flying thickly, I have seen them standing kitting at their doors and talking
to their friends across the street when not a single man was to be seen.

There is no greater mistake than to think women cowards because they are sometimes nervous
over trifles. Were it necessary, innumerable cases could be quoted from history to prove that
women can, upon occasion, fight as courageously as men. Cæsar found that the women of the German
tribes could fight bravely side by side with the men, and the Amazons of the King of Dahomey
are more feared by the neighboring tribes than are his male soldiers. Almost every siege has
its female heroines, and in the Dutch War of Independence the female companies at Sluys and
Haarlem proved themselves a match for the best soldiers of Spain. Above all, in patient endurance
of pain and suffering, women are immeasurably superior to men. I emphasize this point because
I know that many boys, simply because they are stronger than girls, are apt to regard them
with a sort of contempt, and to fancy themselves without the least justification, not only
stronger but braver and more courageous--in fact superior beings in every way.

UNEXPECTED NEWS.

"I have written to ask Ralph Conway to come and stay for a time with me." The announcement
was a simple one, but it fell like a bombshell in the midst of the party at breakfast at Penfold
Hall. The party consisted only of the speaker, Herbert Penfold, and his two sisters. The latter
both exclaimed "Herbert!" in a tone of shocked surprise. Mr. Penfold was evidently prepared
for disapprobation; he had spoken in a somewhat nervous tone, but with a decision quite unusual
to him. He had finished his last piece of toast and emptied his last cup of tea before making
the announcement, and he now pushed back his chair, rose to his feet, and said: "Yes; I have
been thinking of having him here for some time, and I suppose that as master of this house
I am at liberty to ask whom I like; at any rate I would rather have no discussion on the subject."

So saying, without giving his sisters time to reply, he walked hastily to the door and went
out. Miss Penfold and Miss Eleanor Penfold gazed at each other in speechless astonishment.
So accustomed were they to settle everything that took place at Penfold Hall, that this sudden
assumption of authority on the part of their brother fairly staggered them. Miss Penfold was
the first to speak:

"This is terrible, Eleanor! To think that after all these years Herbert's thoughts should still
be turning toward that woman. But it is only what might be expected. The ingratitude of men
is terrible. Here we have for the last twenty years been devoting our lives to him--not only
keeping his house for him, but seeing that he did not fall a victim to any of the designing
women who would have insinuated themselves into his good graces, and preventing him from indulging
in all sorts of foolish tastes and bringing himself to ruin; and now you see he turns again
to that artful woman, and, without saying a word to us, invites her son to come here. It is
monstrous, sister!"

"It is monstrous," Miss Eleanor Penfold repeated, with tears in her eyes. "It is like flying
in the face of Providence, sister."

"It is flying in our faces," Miss Penfold replied sharply; "and just at the present moment
that is of more importance. To think that that man must have been brooding over this, and making
up his mind to act in this way for weeks perhaps, and never to say a word to us upon the subject.
I wonder he didn't ask the woman herself down!"

"He never could have done such a shameless thing, Charlotte," her sister said much shocked.
"Of course, we must have left the house instantly."

"I should not have left the house," Miss Penfold said firmly. "If the woman comes--and now
he has asked the boy it is quite possible that he may ask the mother--our duty will be to remain
here. You know we have been uneasy ever since her husband died. Herbert's infatuation concerning
her has been pitiable, and we have always believed it has been that alone which has caused
him to refuse so obstinately to enter into our plans, or to pay even decent courtesy to the
various excellent young women we have from time to time asked down here, and who were in every
way suitable for the position of mistress of this house--women full of sense, and who, with
right guidance, would have made him perfectly happy. And now he flies in our faces and asks
the boy down. I have had an idea for some little time that he has had something on his mind;
he has been more nervous and fidgety than usual, and several times he has seemed to be on the
point of saying something, and then changed his mind. Of course, one can understand it all
now. No wonder he was ashamed to look us in the face when he was meditating such a step as
this. The duplicity of man is something shocking!"

It was not surprising that Herbert Penfold's sudden assertion of his will was a shock to his
sisters. These ladies had so long been accustomed to rule absolutely at Penfold Hall that Mr.
Penfold's assertion of his right to act as he pleased in his own house came upon them like
an act of absolute rebellion. At their father's death they were women of twenty-seven and twenty-six
years old respectively. Herbert was a lad of sixteen. He was of a gentle and yielding disposition;
and as their father for some years previous to his death had been a confirmed invalid, and
they had had the complete management of the house, it was but natural that at his death they
should continue in the same position.

Owing to weak health, Herbert had not been sent to school, but had been educated under the
care of a tutor. He had wished when he reached the age of nineteen to enter one of the universities;
but his sisters had been so opposed to the idea, and had represented so strongly to him his
unfitness to take part in the rough sports of the young men, and how completely he would feel
out of place in such companionship, that he had abandoned the idea, and had traveled on the
Continent for three years with his tutor, his sisters being for most of the time of the party.
Soon after his return he had fallen in love with the daughter of Colonel Vernon, an officer
living on half-pay at Poole, which was the nearest town to Penfold Hall. The announcement of
his engagement came like a thunder-clap upon his sisters, who had agreed that it would be in
all respects desirable that Herbert should not marry for some years.

They had, however, been wise enough not to offer any open opposition to the match. Three months
later the engagement was broken off. How it came about no one exactly knew. Unpleasant reports
were set on foot; there were misunderstandings which should easily have been cleared up, but
which grew until they gave rise to serious quarrels. Letters which might have set matters straight
somehow failed to come to hand; and so at last things went from bad to worse until there was
a final quarrel, a return of letters and presents on both sides, and a final breaking off of
the engagement. A year later Mary Vernon married Mr. Conway, an architect, resident in London.

Mr. Penfold had before this become convinced that Mary Vernon had not been to blame in the
matter, and that he had in some way or other taken an altogether mistaken view of the subject.
He knew by the comments of such friends as were intimate enough to speak, and the coolness
of many others, that he was considered to have behaved very badly toward her. And this thought
was a most distressing one, for he was deeply attached to Mary; and had he not been convinced
that from some reason or other she herself had ceased to care for him, and was anxious to break
off the engagement, he would have gone any length towards healing the breach. When it was too
late he bitterly regretted his own weakness in submitting to the domination of his sisters,
and felt a deep though silent resentment against them for the share that he was convinced they
had taken in causing the breach between himself and Mary Vernon; but although he resented,
he had neither the will nor firmness to free himself from their domination.

At times he struggled feebly against it; and on two or three occasions had suddenly gone up
to town, and thence on to the Continent, and had traveled there for weeks. On one of these
occasions he had written to them saying that he thought it would be for the happiness of them
all if they were to leave Penfold Hall and set up an establishment of their own. But upon his
return he found things going on exactly as before, and Miss Penfold had spoken somewhat severely
of the silly letter he had written to them, a letter displaying at once such ingratitude and
folly that it had been beneath them to notice it. As Herbert Penfold was in a way really fond
of his sisters, who spared no effort in making his home comfortable for him, and who allowed
him to have his own way in all minor matters, he could not bring himself to repeat when face
to face with them the opinion he had expressed in writing; and so things had gone on for years.

The Miss Penfolds were really anxious to see their brother married. Provided only that it was
to a lady who would be, in their estimation, fitted for him, and who would also have a feeling
of gratitude towards themselves for their share in installing her as mistress of the Hall,
they were quite prepared to abdicate in her favor, and to retire to some pretty house near
a pleasant watering-place, paying visits once or twice a year to the Hall.

The listless life their brother led was a source of grief to them; for they were really attached
to him, and believed that they had in every way been working for his happiness.

They had no shadow of regret for the part they had played in breaking off his engagement with
Mary Vernon. Having once convinced themselves that she was a frivolous girl, quite unsuited
for the position of mistress of Penfold Hall, they had regarded it as an absolute duty to protect
Herbert from the consequences of what they considered his infatuation. Consequently, for years
they were in the habit of inviting for long visits young ladies whom they considered in every
way eligible as their successor, and had been much grieved at their want of success, and at
the absolute indifference with which Herbert regarded the presence of these young women. When,
four years after his marriage to Mary Vernon, Mr. Conway had died suddenly they had been seized
with a vague disquiet; for they believed that the remembrance of his first love was the real
cause of Herbert's indifference to others, and considered it probable he might still be sufficiently
infatuated with her to attempt to undo the past.

To their gratification Herbert never alluded to the subject, never, so far as they knew, made
the slightest effort to renew her acquaintance. In fact, Herbert Penfold was a diffident as
well as a weak man. Once convinced that he had acted badly toward Mary Vernon, he was equally
convinced that she must despise him and that he was utterly unworthy of her. Had it been otherwise
he would have again entered the lists and tried to recover the love he had thrown away.

Although he occasionally yielded to the entreaties of his sisters and showed himself with them
at county gatherings, gave stately dinner-parties at regular intervals, and accepted the invitations
of his neighbors, he lived the life almost of a recluse.

His sole companion and friend was the rector of the parish, who had been his tutor during his
Continental tour, and whom he had presented with the living which was in his gift, to the secret
dissatisfaction of his sisters, who had always considered that Herbert's tutor had endeavored
to set him against them. This had to some extent been the case, in so far, at least, that Mr.
Withers, who had left college only a short time before starting with Herbert, had endeavored
to give him habits of self-reliance and independence of thought, and had quietly striven against
the influence that his sisters had upon his mind. It was not until after the Mary Vernon episode
that the living had fallen vacant; had it been otherwise things might have turned out differently,
for Herbert would certainly have sought his friend's advice in his troubles.

After that it was too late for his interference. Mr. Withers had watched the state of matters
at the Hall, and his young wife had often urged him to try to induce Herbert Penfold to rouse
himself and assert himself against his sisters, but the vicar remained neutral. He saw that
though at times Herbert was a little impatient at the domination of his sisters, and a chance
word showed that he nourished a feeling of resentment toward them, he was actually incapable
of nerving himself to the necessary effort required to shake off their influence altogether,
and to request them to leave the Hall.

Nothing short of this would suffice to establish his independence; for after a mere temporary
assertion of authority he would, if they remained there, assuredly speedily allow affairs to
lapse into their present state, and the vicar thought that harm rather than good would be caused
by his interference, and that, as his influence would be sure to be suspected, there would
be a breach between the Hall and the Rectory. As it was the connection was an intimate one.
Herbert was always glad to see him when he came in for a talk in the course of his rounds,
or when he and his wife would come up to dine quietly. The Miss Penfolds were always ready
with their purses to aid him to carry out his schemes for the good of the parish, and to sympathize
with his young wife in her troubles; for of these she had a large share--all her children,
save one girl, having been carried off in their infancy.

Mabel Withers was as much at home at the Hall as at the Rectory. She was chief pet and favorite
with Mr. Penfold; and although his sisters considered that the rector allowed her to run wild,
and that under such license she was growing up a sad tomboy, they could not withstand the influence
of the child's happy and fearless disposition, and were in their way very kind to her.

Such was the state of things at Penfold Hall when its owner's sudden announcement that he had
invited young Ralph Conway to come to stay there had fallen like a bombshell upon his sisters.

The invitation had caused almost as much surprise to Mrs. Conway as to the Miss Penfolds. Her
father had died a few months after her marriage, and at the death of her husband she found
herself left with an income of about a hundred a year--the interest of the sum for which he
had insured his life.

To her surprise she had a month or two later received an intimation from the lawyer who managed
her business that a friend had arranged to pay the sum of a hundred pounds every quarter to
her account, on condition only that no inquiry whatever should be made as to his or her identity.
Mary Conway had thankfully accepted the gift, which had, however, caused her intense wonderment
and curiosity. So far as she knew neither her father nor her husband had any relations who
could have afforded so handsome a gift. She knew that Colonel Vernon had been most popular
with his regiment, and the supposition at which she finally arrived was that some young officer
whom he had befriended in difficulties had, on coming into a large property, determined similarly
to befriend the daughter of his former colonel.

Had she been alone in the world she would have declined to accept this aid from an unknown
benefactor, but for her son's sake she felt that it would be wrong to do so. The idea that
the money might come from Herbert Penfold had once or twice occurred to her, only to be at
once dismissed, for had she really believed that it came from him she could not, even for Ralph's
sake, have accepted it. He had, as she believed, quarreled with her altogether without cause,
her letters had been unanswered, and she considered the quarrel to have been simply a pretext
upon the part of Herbert to break off an engagement of which he was tired. Words dropped, apparently
by accident, by Herbert's sisters had, before the misunderstanding commenced, favored this
idea, and although she had really loved him her disposition was too spirited to allow her to
take the steps she otherwise might have done to set herself right with him.

At any rate she had no ground whatever for believing that Herbert, after the breach of the
engagement, entertained any such feelings toward her as would have led him to come forward
to assist her in any way after she had become the wife of another; and so for twelve years
she had continued to receive her quarterly income. She had established herself in a pretty
little house near Dover, where several old friends of her father resided, and where she had
plenty of pleasant society among the officers of the regiments stationed there. Although far
from rivaling Portsmouth or Plymouth in life and bustle, Dover was a busy town during the time
of the great war. The garrison was a large one, the channel cruisers often anchored under the
guns of the castle, and from the top of the hills upon a clear day for months a keen lookout
was kept for the appearance from the port of Boulogne of the expedition Napoleon had gathered
there for the invasion of England.

The white sails of the English cruisers as they sailed up or down the channel were clearly
visible, and occasionally a privateer could be seen making its way westward with a prize it
had picked up off Texel. Military and naval matters were the sole topics of conversation, and
by the time he was fifteen Ralph had fully determined to follow in his grandfather's footsteps
and to become a soldier. Having passed almost all her life among military men Mrs. Conway had
offered no objections to his wishes, and as several of her father's old friends had promised
to use their influence on his behalf, there was little doubt that he would be enabled to procure
a commission as soon as he reached the regulation age.

It was not often that the postman called at Mrs. Conway's with letters; for postage was expensive,
and the people in those days only wrote when they had something particular to say. Mrs. Conway
had just made breakfast when Ralph came in with a letter in his hand.

"Here is a letter for you, mother; but please don't open it until you have given me my breakfast.
I am very late now, and shall barely have time to get through with it and be there before the
gates close."

"Your porridge is quite ready for you, Ralph; so if you are late it will be your own fault
not mine. The eggs will be in before you have eaten it. However, I won't open the letter until
you have gone, because you will only waste time by asking questions about it."

Ralph began his bread and milk, and Mrs. Conway, stretching out her hand, took the letter he
had laid beside his plate, and turning it over glanced at the direction to ascertain from which
of her few correspondents it came. For a moment she looked puzzled, then, with a little start,
she laid it down by the side of her plate. She had recognized the handwriting once so familiar
to her.

"What is it, mother? You look quite startled. Who is it from?"

"It is from no one you know, Ralph. I think it is from a person I have not heard from for some
years. At any rate it will keep until you are off to school."

"It's nothing unpleasant, I hope, mother. Your color has quite gone, and you look downright pale."

"What should be the matter, you silly boy?" Mrs. Conway said, with an attempt to smile. "What
could there be unpleasant in a letter from a person I have not heard from for years? There,
go on with your breakfast. I expect you will hear some news when you get down into the town,
for the guns in the castle have been firing, and I suppose there is news of a victory. They
said yesterday that a great battle was expected to be fought against Napoleon somewhere near
Leipzig."

"Yes; I heard the guns, mother, and I expect there has been a victory. I hope not."

"Why do you hope not, Ralph?"

"Why, of course, mother, I don't want the French to be beaten--not regularly beaten, till I
am old enough to have a share in it. Just fancy what a nuisance it would be if peace was made
just as I get my commission."

"There will be plenty of time for you, Ralph," his mother said smiling. "Peace has been patched
up once or twice, but it never lasts long; and after fighting for the last twenty years it
is hardly probable that the world is going to grow peaceful all at once. But there, it is time
for you to be off; it only wants ten minutes to nine and you will have to run fast all the
way to be in time."

When Mrs. Conway was alone she took up the letter, and turned it over several times before
opening it.

What could Herbert Penfold have written about after all these years? Mrs. Conway was but thirty-six
years old now, and was still a pretty woman, and a sudden thought sent a flush of color to
her face. "Never!" she said decidedly. "After the way in which he treated me he cannot suppose
that now--" and then she stopped. "I know I did love him once, dearly, and it nearly broke
my heart; but that was years and years ago. Well, let us see what he says for himself," and
she broke open the letter. She glanced through it quickly, and then read it again more carefully.
She was very pale now, and her lips trembled as she laid down the letter.

"So," she said to herself in a low tone, "it is to him after all I owe all this," and she looked
round her pretty room; "and I never once really suspected it. I am glad now," she went on after
a pause, "that I did not; for, of course, it would have been impossible to have taken it, and
how different the last twelve years of my life would have been. Poor Herbert! And so he really
suffered too, and he has thought of me all this time."

For fully half an hour she sat without moving, her thoughts busy with the past, then she again
took up the letter and reread it several times. Its contents were as follows:

    "Dear Mrs. Conway: You will be doubtless surprised at seeing my
    handwriting, and your first impulse will naturally be to put this
    letter into the fire. I am not writing to ask you to forgive my
    conduct in the old days. I am but too well aware how completely I
    have forfeited all right to your esteem or consideration. Believe
    me that I have suffered for my fault, and that my life has been a
    ruined one. I attempt to make no excuses. I am conscious that
    while others were to blame I was most of all, and that it is to my
    own weakness of will and lack of energy that the breach between us
    was due. However, all this is of the past and can now interest you
    but little. You have had your own sorrows and trials, at which,
    believe me, I sincerely grieved. And now to my object in writing
    to you. Although still comparatively a young man, I have not many
    years to live. When last in London I consulted two of the first
    physicians, and they agreed that, as I had already suspected, I
    was suffering from heart disease, or rather, perhaps, from an
    enfeebled state of my heart, which may at any moment cease to do
    its work.

    "Naturally then, I have turned my thoughts as to whom I should
    leave my property. My sisters are amply provided for. I have no
    other near relatives, and therefore consider myself free to leave
    it as I choose. I have long fixed my thoughts upon the daughter of
    a dear friend, the rector of Bilston; she is now thirteen years
    old, and half my property is left her. I have left the other half
    to your son. The whole subject to an annuity to yourself; which
    you will not, I trust, refuse to accept. I have never thought of
    any woman but you, and I hope that you will not allow your just
    resentment against me to deprive me of the poor satisfaction of
    making what atonement lies in my power for the cruel wrong I
    formerly did you.

    "Were I strong and in health I can well imagine that you would
    indignantly refuse to receive any benefits from my hands, but
    knowing your kindness of heart, I feel sure that you will not
    sadden the last days of a doomed man by the knowledge that even
    after his death his hopes of insuring the comfort of the one woman
    on earth he cared for are to be disappointed.

    "I should like to know your son. Would it be too much to ask you
    to spare him for a while from time to time so long as I live? I
    have a double motive, I say frankly, in thus asking him to come
    here. I wish him and my little pet, Mabel Withers, to come to like
    each other. I wish to divide my property between them, and yet I
    should be glad if the whole estate could remain intact.

    "I should not be so foolish as to make a proviso that two persons
    who are as yet so young, and who may not in any way be suitable to
    each other, should marry, but nothing would please me so much as
    that they should take a fancy to each other; and thrown together
    as they would be here, for Mabel is constantly at the house, it is
    just possible that one of those boy and girl affections, which do
    sometimes, although perhaps rarely, culminate in marriage, might
    spring up between them. He at how straight have been a authority had

Ralph jumped down and procured the desired refreshment, and was just in time to clamber up
to his seat again when the coach started. He enjoyed the rapid motion and changing scene much,
but he was not sorry when--as evening was coming on--he saw ahead of him a dull mist, which
his fellow-passenger told him was the smoke of London.

It was nine in the evening when the coach drove into the courtyard of the Bull Inn. The guard,
who had received instructions from Mrs. Conway, at once gave Ralph and his box into the charge
of one of the porters awaiting the arrival of the coach, and told him to take the box to the
inn from which the coach for Weymouth started in the morning. Cramped by his fourteen hours'
journey Ralph had at first some difficulty in following his conductor through the crowded street,
but the stiffness soon wore off, and after ten minutes walking he arrived at the inn.

The guard had already paid the porter, having received the money for that purpose from Mrs.
Conway; and the latter setting down the box in the passage at once went off. Ralph felt a little
forlorn, and wondered what he was to do next. But a minute later the landlady came out from
the bar.

"Do you want a bed?" she asked. "The porter should have rung the bell. I am afraid we are full,
unless it has been taken beforehand. However, I will see if I can make shift somehow."

"I should be very much obliged if you can," Ralph said; "for I don't know anything about London,
and am going on by the Weymouth coach in the morning."

"Oh, might your name be Conway?"

"Yes, that is my name," Ralph said, surprised.

"Ah, then there is a bedroom taken for you. A gentleman came three days ago and took it, saying
it was for a young gent who is going through to Weymouth. Tom," she called, "take this box
up to number 12. Supper is ready for you, sir. I dare say you would like a wash first?"

"That I should," Ralph replied, following the boots upstairs.

In a few minutes he returned, and a waiter directed him to the coffee-room. In a short time
a supper consisting of fish, a steak, and tea was placed before him. Ralph fell to vigorously,
and the care that had been bestowed by Mr. Penfold in securing a bedroom and ordering supper
for him greatly raised him in the boy's estimation; and he looked forward with warmer anticipations
than he had hitherto done to his visit to him. As goon as he had finished he went off to bed,
and in a few minutes was sound asleep. At half-past six he was called, and after a hearty breakfast
took his seat on the outside of the Weymouth coach.

Sitting beside him were four sailors, belonging, as he soon learned, to a privateer lying at
Weymouth. They had had a long trip, and had been some months at sea; and as their ship was
to lie for a fortnight at Weymouth while some repairs were being done to her, they had obtained
a week's leave and had ran up to London for a spree. Weymouth during the war did a brisk trade,
and was a favorite rendezvous of privateers, who preferred it greatly to Portsmouth or Plymouth,
where the risk of their men being pressed to make up the quota of some man-of-war just fitted
out was very great.

The sailors were rather silent and sulky, at first at the cruise on land being nearly over,
but after getting off the coach where it changed horses they recovered their spirits, and amused
Ralph greatly with their talk about the various prizes they had taken, and one or two sharp
brashes with French privateers. Toward evening they became rather hilarious, but for the last
two hours dozed quietly; the man sitting next to Ralph lurching against him heavily in his
sleep, and swearing loudly when the boy stuck his elbow into his ribs to relieve himself of
the weight. Ralph was not sorry, therefore, when at ten o'clock at night the coach arrived
at Weymouth. The landlord and servants came out with lanterns to help the passengers to alight,
and the former, as Ralph climbed down the side into the circle of light, asked:

"Are you Master Conway?"

"That's my name," Ralph replied.

"A bed has been taken for you, sir, and a trap will be over here at nine o'clock in the morning
to take you to Penfold Hall."

Supper was already prepared for such passengers as were going to sleep in the hotel; but Ralph
was too sleepy to want to eat, and had made a good meal when the coach stopped at six o'clock
for twenty minutes to allow the passengers time for refreshments. At eight o'clock next morning
he breakfasted. When he had finished the waiter told him that the trap had arrived a few minutes
before, and that the horse had been taken out to have a feed, but would be ready to start by
nine. Ralph took a stroll for half an hour by the sea and then returned. The trap was at the
door, and his trunk had already been placed in it. The driver, a man of twenty-three or twenty-four,
was, as he presently told Ralph, stable-helper at Penfold Hall.

"I generally drive this trap when it is wanted," he said. "The coachman is pretty old now.
He has been in the family well-nigh fifty years. He is all right behind the carriage-horses,
he says, but he does not like trusting himself in a pair-wheel trap."

"How far is it?"

"A matter of fifteen miles. It would be a lot shorter if you had got off last night at the
nearest point the coach goes to; but the master told the coachman that he thought it would
be pleasanter for you to come on here than to arrive there tired and sleepy after dark."

"Yes, it will much more pleasant," Ralph said. "The road was very dirty, and I should not like
to arrive at a strange house with my clothes all covered with dust, and so sleepy that I could
hardly keep my eyes open, especially as I hear that Mr. Penfold's sisters are rather particular."

"Rather isn't the word," the driver said; "they are particular, and no mistake. I don't believe
as the master would notice whether the carriage was dirty or clean; but if there is a speck
of dirt about they are sure to spot it. Not that they are bad mistresses; but they look about
all right, I can tell you, pretty sharp. I don't say that it ain't as well as they do, for
the master never seems to care one way or the other, and lets things go anyhow. A nice gentleman
he is, but I don't see much of him; and he don't drive in the carriage not once a month, and
only then when he is going to the board of magistrates. He just walks about the garden morning
and evening, and all the rest of the time he is shut up in the library with his books. It's
a pity he don't go out more."

"Are there any families about with boys?" Ralph asked.

"Not as I knows of. None of then that ever comes to the Hall, anyhow. It's a pity there ain't
some young ones there; it would wake the place up and make it lively. It would give us a lot
more work to do, I don't doubt; but we shouldn't mind that. I have heard it used to be different
in the old squire's time, but it has always been so as long as I can remember. I don't live
at the house, but down at the village. Jones he lives over the stables; and there ain't no
occasion to have more than one there, for there's only the two carriage-horses and this."

"How far is the sea from the house?"

"It's about half a mile to the top of the cliff, and a precious long climb down to the water;
but going round by Swanage--which is about three miles--you can drive down close to the sea,
for there are no cliffs there."

There was little more said during the drive. From time to time the man pointed out the various
villages and country seats, and Ralph wondered to himself how he should manage to pass the
next three weeks. It seemed that there would be nothing to do and no one to talk to. He had
always been accustomed to the companionship of lots of boys of his own age, and during the
holidays there was plenty of sailing and fishing, so that time had never hung on his hands;
the present prospect therefore almost appalled him. However, he had promised his mother that
he would try to make the best of things; and he tried to assure himself that after all three
weeks or a month would be over at last. After an hour and a half's drive they passed through
a lodge gate into a park, and in a few minutes drew up at the entrance to Penfold Hall. An
old servant came out.

"Will you come with me into the library, sir? Mr. Penfold is expecting you. Your box will be
taken up into your room."

Ralph felt extremely uncomfortable as he followed his conductor across a noble hall, floored
with dark polished oak, and paneled with the same material. A door opened, and a servant announced
"Master Conway." A gentleman rose from his chair and held out his hand.

"I am glad to see you, Ralph Conway; and I hope your journey has been a pretty comfortable
one. It is very good of you to come such a long distance to pay me a visit."

"Mother wanted me to, sir," Ralph said honestly. "I don't think--" and he stopped.

"You don't think you would have come of your own accord, Ralph? No, that is natural enough,
my boy. At your, age I am sure I should not have cared to give up my holidays and spend them
in a quiet house among strangers. However, I wanted to see you, and I am very glad you have
come. I am an old friend of your mother's, you know, and so desired to make the acquaintance
of her son. I think you are like her," he said, putting his hand on Ralph's shoulder and taking
him to the window and looking steadily at him.

"Other people have said so, sir; but I am sure I can't [illegible words] be like her a bit.
Mother is so pretty, and I am sure I am not the least bit in the world; and I don't think it's
nice for a boy to be like a woman."

This was rather a sore point with Ralph, who had a smooth soft face with large eyes and long
eyelashes, and who had, in consequence, been nicknamed "Sally" by his schoolfellows. The name
had stuck to him in spite of several desperate fights, and the fact that in point of strength
and activity he was fully a match for any boy of his own age; but as there was nothing like
derision conveyed by it, and it was indeed a term of affection rather, than of contempt, Ralph
had at last ceased to struggle against it. But he longed for the time when the sprouting of
whiskers would obliterate the obnoxious smoothness of his face. Mr. Penfold had smiled at his
remark.

"I do not like girlish boys, Ralph; but a boy can have a girlish face and yet be a true boy
all over. I fancy that's your case.

"I hope so, sir. I think I can swim or run or fight any of the chaps of my own age in the school;
but I know I do look girlish about the face. I have done everything I could to make my face
rough. I have sat in the sun, and wetted it with sea-water every five minutes, but it's no use."

"I should not trouble about it. Your face will get manly enough in time, you may be sure; and
I like you all the better for it, my boy, because you are certainly very like your mother.
And now, Ralph, I want you to enjoy yourself as much as you can while you are here. The house
itself is dull, but I suppose you will be a good deal out of doors. I have hired a pony, which
will be here to-day from Poole, and I have arranged with Watson, a fisherman at Swanage, that
you can go out with him in his fishing-boat whenever you are disposed. It is three miles from
here, but you can ride over on your pony and leave it at the little inn there till you come
back. I am sorry to say I do not know any boys about here; but Mabel Withers, the daughter
of my neighbor and friend the clergyman of Bilston, the village just outside the lodge, has
a pony, and is a capital rider, and I am sure she will show you over the country. I suppose
you have not had much to do with girls?" he added with a smile at seeing a slight expression
of dismay on Ralph's face, which had expressed unmixed satisfaction at the first items of the
programme.

"No, sir; not much," Ralph said. "Of course some of my schoolfellows have sisters, but one
does not see much of them."

"I think you will get on very well together. She is a year or two younger than you are, and
I am afraid she is considered rather a tomboy. She has been caught at the top of a tall tree
examining the eggs in a nest, and in many similar ungirl-like positions; so you won't find
her a dull companion. She is a great pet of mine, and though she may not be as good a companion
as a boy would be for you, I am sure when you once get to know her you will find her a very
good substitute. You see, not having had much to do with boys, I am not very good at devising
amusement for you. I can only say that if there is anything you would like to do while you
are here you have only to tell me, and if it be possible I will put you in the way of it."

"Thank you very much, sir. You are extremely kind," Ralph said heartily; for with a pony and
a boat it did seem that his visit would not be nearly so dull as he had anticipated. "I am
sure I shall get on capitally."

Just at his moment there was a knock at the door. It opened, and a girl entered.

"You have just come at the right moment, Mabel," Mr. Penfold said as she came in. "This is
Ralph Conway, of whom I was speaking to you. Ralph, this is Mabel Withers. I asked her to come
in early this morning so as to act as your guide round the place."

The boy and girl shook hands with each other. She was the first to speak.

"So you are Ralph. I have been wondering what you would be like. Uncle has been telling me
you were coming. I like your looks, and I think you are nice."

Ralph was taken rather aback. This was not the way in which his schoolfellows' sisters had
generally addressed him.

"I think you look jolly," he said; "and that's better than looking nice."

"I think they mean the same thing," she replied; "except that a girl says 'nice' and a boy
says 'jolly.' I like the word 'jolly' best, only I get scolded when I use it. Shall we go into
the garden?"

Altogether Ralph Conway had a very much pleasanter time than he had anticipated. Except at
meals he saw little of the Miss Penfolds. His opinion as to these ladies, expressed confidentially
to Mabel Withers, was the reverse of flattering.

"I think," he said, "that they are the two most disagreeable old cats I have ever met. They
hardly ever open their lips, and when they do it is only to answer some question of their brother.
I remember in a fairy story there was a girl who whenever she spoke let fall pearls and diamonds
from her lips; whenever those women open their mouths I expect icicles and daggers to drop out."

"They are not so bad as that," Mabel laughed. "I generally get on with them very well, and
they are very kind in the parish; and altogether they are really not bad."

"Then their looks belie them horribly," Ralph said. "I suppose they don't like me; and that
would be all well enough if I had done anything to offend them, but it was just as bad the
first day I came. I am sure Mr. Penfold does not like it. I can see him fidget on his chair;
and he talks away with me pretty well all the time we are at table, so as to make it less awkward,
I suppose. Well, I am stopping with him, and not with them, that's one thing; and it doesn't
make much difference to me if they do choose to be disagreeable. I like him immensely. He is
wonderfully kind; but it would be awfully stupid work if it weren't for you, Mabel. I don't
think I could stand it if it were not for our rides together."

The young people had indeed got on capitally from the first. Every day they took long rides
together, generally alone, although sometimes Mr. Penfold rode with them. Ralph had already
confided to the latter, upon his asking him how he liked Mabel, that she was the jolliest girl
that he had ever met.

"She has no nonsensical girl's ways about her, Mr. Penfold; but is almost as good as a boy
to be with. The girls I have seen before have been quite different from that. Some of them
always giggle when you speak to them, others have not got a word to say for themselves; and
it is awfully hard work talking to them even for a single dance. Still, I like them better
than the giggling ones."

"You see, Ralph, girls brought up in a town are naturally different to one like Mabel. They
go to school, and are taught to sit upright and to behave discreetly, and to be general unnatural.
Mabel has been brought up at home and allowed to do as she liked, and she has consequently
grown up what nature intended her to be. Perhaps some day all girls will be allowed the same
chance of being natural that boys have, and backboards and other contrivances for stiffening
them and turning them into little wooden figures will be unknown. It will be a good thing,
in my opinion, when that time arrives."

Ralph was often down at the Rectory, where he was always made welcome, Mr. Withers and his
wife being anxious to learn as much of his disposition as they could. They were well satisfied
with the result.

"I fancy I know what is in Penfold's mind," the rector had said to his wife a few days after
Ralph came down. "I believe he has already quite settled it in his mind that some day Mabel
and this lad shall make a match of it."

"How absurd, John. Why, Mabel is only a child."

"Quite so, my dear; but in another three or four years she will be a young woman. I don't mean
that Penfold has any idea that they are going to take a fancy to each other at present--only
that they will do so in the future. You know he has said that he intends to leave a slice of
his fortune to her, and I have no doubt that this lad will get the main bulk of his property.
I have often told you about his engagement to the lad's mother, and how the breaking it off
has affected his whole life. It is natural that a lonely man as he is should plan for others.
He has no future of his own to look forward to, so he looks forward to some one else's. He
has had no interest in life for a great many years, and I think he is making a new one for
himself in the future of our girl and this lad.

"As far as I have seen of the boy I like him. He is evidently a straightforward, manly lad.
I don't mean to say that he has any exceptional amount of brains, or is likely to set the Thames
on fire; but if he comes into the Penfold property that will not be of much importance. He
seems bright, good-tempered, and a gentleman. That is quite good enough to begin with. At any
rate, there is nothing for us to trouble about. If some day the young people get to like each
other the prospect is a good one for the child; if not, there's no harm done. At present there
can be no objection to our yielding to Penfold's request and letting them ride about the country
together. Mabel is, as you say, little more than a child, and it is evident that the lad regards
her rather in the light of a boy companion than as a girl.

"She is a bit of a tomboy, you know, Mary, and has very few girlish notions or ideas. They
evidently get on capitally together, and we need not trouble our heads about them but let things
go their own way with a clear conscience."

At the end of the time agreed upon Ralph returned home.

"And so, Ralph, you have found it better than you expected?" his mother said to him at the
conclusion of his first meal at home.

"Much better, mother. Mr. Penfold is awfully kind, and lets one do just what one likes. His
sisters are hateful women, and if I had not been staying in the house I should certainly have
played them some trick or other just to pay them out. I wonder why they disliked me so much.
I could see it directly I arrived; but, after all, it didn't matter much, except just at meals
and in the evening. But though Mr. Penfold was so kind, it would have been very stupid if it
had not been for Mabel Withers. We used to ride out or go for walks together every day. She
was a capital walker, and very jolly--almost as good as a boy. She said several times that
she wished she had been a boy, and I wished so too. Still, of course, mother, I am very glad
I am back. There is no place like home, you know; and then there are the fellows at school,
and the games, and the sea, and all sorts of things; and it's a horrid nuisance to think that
I have got to go down there regularly for my holidays. Still, of course, as you wish it, I
will do so; and now that I know what it is like it won't be so bad another time. Anyhow, I
am glad I have got another ten days before school begins."

The following morning Ralph went down to the beach. "Why, Master Conway," an old fisherman
said, "you are a downright stranger. I have missed you rarely."

"I told you I was going away, Joe, and that I shouldn't get back until the holidays were nearly
over."

"I know you did," the fisherman replied. "Still it does seem strange without you. Every time
as I goes out I says to Bill if Master Conway was at home he would be with us to-day, Bill.
It don't seem no ways natural without him.' And there's been good fishing, too, this season,
first rate; and the weather has been just what it should be."

"Well, I am back now, Joe, anyhow; and I have got ten days before school begins again, and
I mean to make the most of it. Are you going out to-day?"

"At four o'clock," the fisherman said. "Daylight fishing ain't much good just now; we take
twice as many at night."

"No trouble with the Frenchies?"

"Lord bless you I ain't seen a French sail for months. Our cruisers are too sharp for them;
though they say a good many privateers run in and out of their ports in spite of all we can
do, and a lot of our ships get snapped up. But we don't trouble about them. Why, bless your
heart, if one of them was to run across us they would only just take our fish, and as likely
as not pay us for them with a cask or two of spirits. Fish is a treat to them Frenchies; for
their fishing boats have to keep so close over to their own shores that they can't take much.
Besides, all their best fishermen are away in the privateers, and the lads have to go to fight
Boney's battles with the Austrians or Russians, or Spanish or our chaps, or else to go on board
their ships of war and spend all their time cooped up in harbor, for they scarce show now beyond
the range of the guns in their forts. Well, will you come this evening?"

"Yes, I think so, Joe. My mother doesn't much care about my being out at night, you know; but
as I have been away all this time to please her, I expect she will let me do what I like for
the rest of the holidays."

"Don't you come if your mother don't like it, Master Conway; there is never no good comes of
boys vexing their mothers. I have known misfortune to follow it over and over again. Boys think
as they know best what's good for them; but they don't, and sooner or later they are sure to
own it to themselves."

"I shouldn't do it if I knew she really didn't like it, Joe; but I don't think she does mind
my going out with you at any time. She knows she can trust you. Beside, what harm could come
of it? You never go out in very rough weather."

"Pretty roughish sometimes, Master Conway."

"Oh, yes, pretty rough; but not in a gale, you know. Beside, the Heartsease could stand a goodish
gale. She is not very fast, you know, but she is as safe as a house."

"She is fast enough," the old fisherman said in an injured tone. "But you young gentlemen is
never content unless a boat is heeling over, gunnel under, and passing everything she comes
across. What's the good of that ere to a fisherman? He goes out to catch fish, not to strain
his craft all over by running races against another. Now an hour faster or slower makes no
difference, and the Heartsease is fast enough for me, anyhow."

"No, she isn't, Joe. I have heard you use bad language enough when anything overhauls and passes
her on the way back to port."

"Ay, that may be," the fisherman admitted; "and on the way home I grant you that a little more
speed might be an advantage, for the first comer is sure to get the best market. No, the Heartsease
ain't very fast, I own up to that; but she is safe and steady, and she has plenty of storage
room and a good roomy cabin as you can stand upright in, and needn't break your back by stooping
as you have to do on board some craft I could name."

"That's true enough, Joe," the boy said.

"But what's more, she's a lucky boat; for it's seldom that she goes out without getting a good
catch."

"I think that's more judgment than luck, Joe; though there may be some luck in it too."

"I don't know about that, Master Conway. Of course one wants a sharp eye to see where the shoals
are moving; but I believes in luck. Well, sir, shall I see you again before the afternoon?"

"I don't much expect so, Joe. I have got to call at some other places, and I don't suppose
I shall have time to get down before. If I am coming I shall be sure to be punctual; so if
I am not here by four, go off without me."

Mrs. Conway made no objection when Ralph proffered his request. He had sacrificed the greater
part of his holidays to carrying out her wishes, and paying a visit to Mr. Penfold; and although
she did not like his being out all night fishing, she could not refuse his request; and, indeed,
as she knew that Joe Knight was a steady man and not fond of the bottle, there was no good
reason why she should object. She, therefore, cheerfully assented, saying at the same time,
"I will pack a basket for you before you start, Ralph. There is a nice piece of cold meat in
the house, and I will have that and a loaf of bread and some cheese put up for you. I know
what these fishing excursions are; you intend to be back at a certain time, and then the wind
falls, or the tide turns, or something of that sort, and you can't make the harbor. You know
what a fright you gave me the very first time you went out fishing with Joe Knight. You were
to have been back at five o'clock in the afternoon, and you did not get in until three o'clock
the next morning."

"I remember, mother; and there you were on the quay when we came in. I was awfully sorry about it."

"Well, I have learned better since, Ralph; and I know now that there is not necessarily any
danger, even if you don't come back by the time I expect you. And of course each time I have
fidgeted and you have come back safe, I have learned a certain amount of sea-knowledge, and
have come to know that sailors and fishermen are not accountable for time; and that if the
wind drops or tide turns they are helpless in the matter, and have only to wait till a breeze
comes up again."

"I think, mother, you ought to like my going out at night better than in the daytime."

"Why, Ralph?"

"Because, mother, if I go out in the daytime and don't get back until after dark, you worry
yourself, and having no one to talk to, sit here wondering and wondering until you fancy all
sorts of things. Now, if I go out in the evening, and I don't come back in the morning at the
hour you expect, you see that it is fine and bright, and that there is nothing to make you
uneasy; or if you do feel fidgety, you can walk down to the beach and talk to the boatmen and
fishermen, and of course they can tell you at once that there's nothing to worry about, and
very likely point the boat out to you in the distance."

"Well, Ralph, perhaps that is so, although I own I never looked at it in that light before."

CHAPTER III.

RUN DOWN.

"There's a nice breeze," Ralph said as he joined the fisherman at the appointed hour.

"Yes, it's just right; neither too light nor too heavy. It's rather thick, and I shouldn't
be surprised if we get it thicker; but that again don't matter." For in those days not one
ship plowed the waters of our coast for every fifty that now make their way along it. There
were no steamers, and the fear of collision was not ever in the minds of those at sea.

"Where's Bill, Joe?"

"The young scamp!" the fisherman said angrily. "Nothing will do for him but to go a-climbing
up the cliffs this morning; and just after you left us, news comes that the young varmint had
fallen down and twisted his foot, and doctor says it will be a fortnight afore he can put a
boot on. Then the old woman began a-crying over him; while, as I told her, if any one ought
to cry it would be me, who's got to hire another boy in his place to do his work. A touch of
the strap would be the best thing for him, the young rascal!"

"You are not going to take another boy out to-night are you, Joe?"

"No, Master Conway, I knows you like a-doing things. You have been out enough with me to know
as much about it as Bill, and after all there ain't a very great deal to do. The trawl ain't
a heavy one, and as I am accustomed to work it with Bill I can do it with you."

The Heartsease was a good-sized half-decked boat of some twenty-six feet long and eight feet
beam. She was very deep, and carried three tons of stone ballast in her bottom. She drew about
six feet of water. She had a lot of freeboard, and carried two lug-sails and a small mizzen.

They got in the small boat and rowed off to her.

"There was no call for you to bring that basket, Master Conway. I know you are fond of a fish
fried just when it is taken out of the water; and I have got bread and a keg of beer, to say
nothing of a mouthful of spirits in case we get wet. Not that it looks likely we shall, for
I doubts if there will be any rain to-night I think there will be more wind perhaps, and that
it will get thicker; that's my view of the weather."

They sailed straight out to sea. Joe had fitted his boat to be worked with the aid of a boy
only. He had a handy winch, by which he hoisted his heavy lug-sails, and when the weather was
rough hauled up his trawls. Of these he carried two, each fourteen feet long, and fished with
them one out on each quarter. When he reached the fishing ground six miles out, Joe lowered
the mizzen lug and reefed the main, for there was plenty of wind to keep the boat going at
the pace required for trawling under the reduced sail. Then the trawls were got overboard,
each being fastened to the end of a stout spar lashed across the deck, and projecting some
eight feet on either side, by which arrangement the trawls were kept well apart. They were
hauled alternately once an hour, two hours being allowed after they were put down before the
first was examined.

By the time the first net came up the sun had set. The wind had freshened a bit since they
had started, but there was no sea to speak of. The night had set in thick, and the stars could
only occasionally be seen. Joe had picked out two or three fine fish from the first haul, and
these he took down and soon had frizzling in a frying-pan over the fire, which he had lighted
as soon as the boat was under sail.

"These are for you, Master Conway," he said. "With your permission I shall stick to that ere
piece of beef your mother was good enough to send. Fish ain't no treat to me, and I don't often
get meat. Keep your eye lifting while I am down below. There ain't many craft about in these
days, still we might tumble against one."

"I should not see a light far in this mist, Joe."

"No, you couldn't; and what's worse, many of them don't carry no lights at all."

"It would be a good thing, Joe, if there was a law to make all vessels carry lights."

"Ay, ay, lad; but you see in war times it ain't always convenient. A peaceful merchantman don't
want to show her lights to any privateers that may happen to be cruising about, and you may
be sure that the privateer don't want to attract the attention of peaceful traders until she
is close upon them, or to come under the eye of any of our cruisers. No, no; there ain't many
lights shown now, not in these waters. Folks prefer to risk the chance of running into each
other rather than that of being caught by a French privateer."

Now that the trawls were out there was no occasion for any one to attend to the helm, consequently
when Joe announced that the fish were ready Ralph went down and joined him in the cabin. The
first hours of the night passed quietly. Once an hour a trawl was hauled in and got on board,
and as the catches were satisfactory Joe was in capital spirit.

"You have brought good luck, Master Conway; and I notices I generally do well when you are
out with me. I am getting more fish to-night than I have any night for weeks, and if it goes
on like this till morning I shall make a good thing of it. I wants it bad enough, for I am
in arrears a bit with my rent. The war has made everything so terrible dear that it is as much
as a poor man can do to keep his head above water.

"What time is it now, Joe, do you think?"

"About two o'clock, I reckon. It will begin to get light in a couple of hours, and at five
we will up nets and make our way back."

He had scarcely spoken when he shouted "Ship ahoy! Look out for yourself, lad!" Startled by
the suddenness of the cry Ralph looked round. He saw a crest of white foam a few yards away
in the darkness. A moment later something dark passed over his head and a rope brushed his
cheek, and as it did so a black mass struck the boat. There was a crash, a shock, and the Heartsease,
after first heeling deeply over under the pressure, suddenly sank down like a stone. Ralph
had staggered under the force of the collision, and would have fallen back as the boat heeled
over, but instinctively he threw up his arms and his hand came in contact with the rope that
had an instant before touched his cheek. He seized it with both hands, and threw his legs round
it as the boat went down from under his feet, the whole thing being so sudden that it was nearly
a minute before he could realize what had happened. Then he heard voices talking close by and,
as it seemed, above him.

"Hullo!" he shouted. "Help!" A few seconds later the light of a lantern was flashed down upon
him. Then a figure crawled out on the spar projecting above his head, seized him by the collar,
and lifted him from the bobstay to which he was clinging on to the bowsprit. A minute later
he was standing on the deck.

"Thank you!" he exclaimed. "Have you seen anything of the man who was with me? There were two
of us on board. If not, please look for him at once."

"I am afraid it's no use," one of the men said, with a strong foreign accent; "he has gone
down and will never come up again. You come along with me to the captain."

An uneasy feeling seized Ralph as he listened. He could see nothing, for the lantern had been
placed in a bucket the moment that he touched the deck. At this moment a hail came from the
stern of the vessel, and Ralph's fears were at once realized, for it was in French. The reply
was in the same tongue, and he was led aft. "Take him down below, Jacques, and let's see what
he is like. We have suffered no damage, I hope?"

"Not as far as I could see by the light of the lantern, but the carpenter has gone below to
see if she is making water."

The captain led the way down into the cabin. This was comfortably furnished and lighted by
a swinging lamp. "Do you come, down Jacques, I shall want you to interpret."

The captain was surprised when he saw by the light of the lamp that the person they had rescued
was a lad, well dressed, and evidently above the condition of fishermen.

"Now, young sir, who are you," he asked, "and what have you to say for yourself?" The question
was translated by Jacques.

"I like that," the lad said indignantly. "What have I to say for myself! I think it's what
have you to say for yourselves? We were quietly fishing when you ran over us and sank the boat
and drowned my friend Joe, and haven't even stopped for a moment to see if you could pick him
up. I call it shameful and inhuman!"

The French captain laughed as Jacques translated the speech, the purport of which he had, indeed,
made out for himself, for although he did not speak English he understood it to some extent.

"Tell him it was his fault as much as ours. We did not see him till we struck him. And as for
his companion, what chance was there of finding him on such a dark night as this? Why, by the
time we had hove round and got back again we might not have hit it within a quarter of a mile.
Besides, if he had been alive he would have shouted."

Ralph saw, when he understood what the captain said, that there was truth in his words, and
that the chances of discovering Joe would indeed have been slight even had the vessel headed round.

"May I ask," he said, "what ship this is, and what you are going to do with me?"

"The ship is La Belle Marie of Dunkirk; as to what we are going to do with you it is not so
easy to say. Of course you can jump overboard again if you like, but if not you can stay on
board until we have an opportunity of putting you ashore somewhere. How did you come to be
on board a fishing smack? For I suppose it was a smack that we run down."

"I live at Dover," Ralph replied, "and had only come out for a night's fishing."

"Well, you are out of luck," the captain said. "That will do, Jacques. Take him forward and
sling a hammock for him. Hang up his clothes in the cook's galley, they will be dry by the
time he wakes."

Ralph asked no questions, as he was taken forward, as to the character of La Belle Marie. Six
guns were ranged along on each side of her decks, and this, and the appearance of the captain's
cabin, was sufficient to inform him that he had fallen into the hands of a French privateer.
The craft had, indeed, left Dunkirk soon after nightfall, and was making her way down channel
with every sail set when she had run down the unfortunate fishing boat.

Jacques, as he hung up the hammock, explained to the sailors who crowded round the character
of the passenger who had so unexpectedly come on board.

"Poor lad," one of the sailors said good-naturedly, "he will be some time before he sees his
mother again. He hasn't got a very bright lookout before him--a long voyage, and then a prison.
I will go and see if the cook has got some water hot. A glass of spirits will do him good."

A few minutes later Ralph was wrapped up in a blanket and the warm glow produced by that and
the glass of strong grog soon sufficed to send him soundly to sleep, in spite of the painful
uncertainty of his position and of his sorrowful thought of his mother, who would in the morning
be inquiring for him in vain. It was nearly midday before he woke. Looking round he saw that
he had the forecastle to himself. His clothes were lying on a chest close by, and in a few
minutes he was on deck. A sense of disappointment stole over him. He had, while he was dressing,
entertained the hope that on going on deck he should see an English cruiser in pursuit; but
the wind had dropped and it was still thick, and his vision was confined to a circle a quarter
of a mile in diameter. Jacques nodded to him good-temperedly, for all on board the privateer
were in high spirits. Their voyage had begun propitiously; the darkness of the preceding night
had enabled them to ran the gantlet of the British cruisers in the narrow part of the channel,
they were now well down the coast of France, and the fog reduced their chances of being seen
by an enemy to a minimum.

"Where about are we?" Ralph asked.

"We are somewhere off the mouth of the Seine, and I guess some fifteen miles from land."

"Oh, we are working down the channel then," Ralph said. "And where are we going to?"

"Ah! that question is for the captain to answer if he chooses," Jacques said.

"Are we going to touch at the next French port?" Ralph asked anxiously.

"Not that I know of, unless we have the luck to pick up one of your merchantmen, and we might
then escort her into port. But unless we do that we do not touch anywhere, luckily for you;
because, after all, it is a good deal pleasanter cruising in the Belle Marie than kicking your
heels inside a prison. I know pretty well, for I was for four years a prisoner in your English
town of Dorchester. That is how I came to speak your language. It was a weary time of it; though
we were not badly treated, not half so bad as I have heard that the men in some other prisons
were. So I owe you English no ill-will on that account, and from what I have heard some of
our prisons are worse than any of yours. I used to knit stockings and wraps for the neck. My
old mother taught me when I was a boy. And as we were allowed to sell the things we made I
got on pretty comfortable. Beside, what's the use of making yourself unhappy? I had neither
wife nor children to be fretting about me at home, so I kept up my spirits."

"How did you get back?" Ralph asked. "Were you exchanged?"

"No," Jacques answered. "I might have waited long enough before that. I can't make out myself
why the two governments don't agree to exchange prisoners more quickly. I suppose they take
about an equal number. Your men-of-war ships capture more prisoners than ours, but we make
up for it by the numbers our privateers bring in. At any rate they might exchange as many as
they can, say once in six months. One would have thought they would be glad to do so so as
to save themselves the trouble and expense of looking after and feeding such a number of useless
mouths. Governments always have curious ways."

"But how did you get away from prison?" Ralph asked.

"It was a woman," the man replied. "It is always women who help men out of scrapes. It was
the wife of one of the jailers. She used to bring her husband's dinner sometimes when we were
exercising in the yard. When I first went there she had a child in her arms--a little thing
about a year old. I was always fond of children; for we had a lot at home, brothers and sisters,
and I was the eldest. She saw me look at it one day, and I suppose she guessed it reminded
me of home. So she stopped and let me pat its cheek and talk to it. Then I knitted it some
socks and a little jacket and other things, and that made a sort of friendship between us.
You can always win a woman's heart by taking notice of her child. Then she got to letting me
carry it about on my shoulder while she took her husband's dinner in to him, if he did not
happen to be in the yard. And when the little thing was able to totter it would hold on to
my finger, and was always content to stay with me while she was away. Discovery was seen on several

 After running down nearly as far as Bordeaux the vessel's head was pointed west, and
by nightfall the French coast was out of sight. A vigilant lookout was now kept, one man being
constantly stationed aloft, and by the increased animation of the crew Ralph judged that they
would soon arrive at a point where they should be on the course of homeward bound merchantmen.
He had quite made up his mind that, although ready in all other matters to do his duty as one
of the crew of La Belle Marie, nothing should induce him to take part in a fight against his
own countrymen.

As soon as night fell sail was reduced, and in the morning when at eight bells Ralph came on
deck with his watch he found that the whole of the upper sails had been taken off her and the
topsails lowered on the cap, and the brig was only moving through the water at the rate of
two or three knots an hour. He guessed that she must be just upon the track of ships, and that
her object in thus taking off sail was to catch sight of vessels in the distance while she
herself would be unobserved by them. During the course of the day several sail were seen passing,
but all at a considerable distance. Either the captain did not think that it was safe to commence
operations at present, or he did not like the look of some of the passing vessels; but at any
rate he made no movement to close with any of them, and it was not until nightfall that sail
was again hoisted and the brig proceeded on her course.

Ralph noticed that she carried no light, and that even the binnacle was carefully shaded so
that its light could not be seen except by the helmsman. At midnight his watch went on deck,
and Ralph perceived that while he had been below the sail had again been greatly reduced, and
noticed that from time to time the officer on watch swept the horizon with his night-glass.
He apparently observed nothing until about two o'clock, when he stood for some time gazing
intently astern. Then he turned, gave an order to a sailor, who went below, and two or three
minutes later the captain came on deck. After speaking to the officer he too gazed intently
astern. Then the ship's course was suddenly changed, the sheets eased off, and for half an
hour she ran at a sharp angle to the course she had before been following, then she was brought
up into the eye of the wind and laid to.

Although Ralph strained his eyes in the direction in which the captain had been looking, he
could see nothing; but he had no doubt a sail had been seen coming up astern, and that the
object of the change of course was to let her pass them without their being seen. He rather
wondered that, instead of running off the wind, the captain had not put her about so as to
take her position to windward instead of to leeward of the vessel behind; but he soon arrived
at the object of the maneuver. There were no stars to be seen, and the bank of clouds overhead
stretched away to the east, and the horizon there was entirely obscured; but to the west the
sky was lighter, and a vessel would be clearly visible to the eye. The brig, therefore, in
the position she had taken up could not be seen, while she herself would obtain a full view
of the other as she passed her.

In an hour the other ship came along. She was a large ship, full rigged, and the French sailors,
who had all come on deck, now clustered against the bulwarks and eagerly discussed her. She
was about two miles to windward, and opinions differed as to whether she was a man-of-war or
an Indiaman. Ralph rather wondered that the privateer had not tried to get alongside in the
darkness and take the vessel by surprise, but he understood now that there was a strong probability
that the Belle Marie might have caught a tartar and have suddenly run herself under the guns
of a British frigate. As soon as the vessel had passed, the braces were manned and the yards
swung round, and the brig continued her course. She was brought up almost to the wind's-eye
and sailed as closely as possible, so that when morning broke she should have recovered the
leeway she had made and should be to windward of the vessel she was pursuing, no matter how
much astern.

CHAPTER IV.

THE PRIVATEER'S RENDEZVOUS.

When morning broke the vessel that the privateer had been watching in the night was seen to
be three miles directly ahead. She was a large vessel, and for some time opinions differed
as to whether she was a frigate or an Indiaman; but when it became quite light a patch or two
in the canvas showed that she could not be a man-of-war, and all sail was at once crowded on
to the privateer. The other ship at once shook out more canvas, but half an hour sufficed to
show that the privateer was much the faster vessel. The stranger took in the extra canvas she
had set, and continued her course as if altogether regardless of the privateer.

"They have made up their minds to fight," Jacques said to Ralph. "Now he finds that he can't
outsail us he has got on to easy working canvas. She is a big ship, and I expect carries heavier
metal than we do. It may be that she has troops on board."

The brig kept eating out to windward until she gained a position about a mile upon the starboard
quarter of the Indiaman, then the long pivot-gun was leveled and the first shot fired. The
crew had by this time all taken their places by the guns, and Ralph and the other boys brought
up powder and shot from the magazine. It was not without a struggle that Ralph brought himself
to do this; but he saw that a refusal would probably cost him his life, and as some one else
would bring up the cartridges in his place his refusal would not benefit his countrymen.

He had just come on deck when the gun was fired, and saw the water thrown up just under the
ship's stern, and the shot was dancing away to leeward. The next shot struck the merchantman
on the quarter. A moment later the vessel was brought up into the wind and a broadside of eight
guns fired. Two of them struck the hull of the privateer, another wounded the mainmast, while
the rest cut holes through the sails and struck the water a quarter of a mile to windward.
With an oath the captain of the privateer brought his vessel up into the wind, and then payed
off on the other tack.

The merchantman carried much heavier metal than he had given her credit for. As she came round
too, some redcoats were seen on her deck. Apparently well satisfied with the display she had
made of her strength, the ship bore off again and went quietly, on her way, while the privateer
was hove to and preventer stays put to the mainmast. Ralph remained below for some time; he
heard the men savagely cursing, and thought it was best for him not to attract attention at
present. The sails were lowered and the brig drifted quietly all day; but about ten o'clock
Ralph heard a creaking of blocks, and knew that the sails had been hoisted again. Half an hour
later the watch below was ordered to come quietly on deck. Ralph went up with the rest.

For a quarter of an hour he could see nothing, and then he made out a dark mass a few hundred
yards to leeward; immediately afterward the helm was put up, and the brig run down toward the
stranger. Two minutes later there was a sharp hail, followed instantly by shouts and the sound
of feet; but before the crew could gain the deck and prepare for defence the brig was alongside,
and a moment later her crew sprang upon the decks of the stranger. A few blows were given;
but the resistance offered was slight, and in a very short time the crew were disarmed or driven
below, and the vessel in the possession of the privateer. She proved to be a small bark on
her way out to the Mediterranean. She carried only twenty hands and four small guns, and was
laden with hardware.

The privateer's crew at once set to work upon her. At first Ralph could not understand what
they were about, but he was not long in discovering. The wedges round the mainmast were knocked
out, the topmast lowered to the deck, the shrouds and stays slacked off, and then the mast
was lifted and carried on board the brig. As soon as this was done, the second mate of the
brig with eight sailors went on board as a prize crew. Everything was made taut and trim for
them by the brig's crew. The English prisoners had already been disarmed and battened down
in the hold, and the prize crew then hoisted sail and prepared to take her under mizzen and
foremast only to a French port. This, if she had luck, she would reach in safety, but if on
the way she fell in with a British privateer or cruiser she would of course fall an easy prey.

No sooner was the bark on her way than the privateersmen set to work to lift out their injured
mainmast, and to replace it with that they had brought on board from the bark. When daylight
broke anxious glances were cast round the horizon; but although a few distant sails were seen,
none of these were following a course that would bring them near the brig, and the latter without
sail and with her foremast alone standing would not be likely to be noticed. Ralph could not
help admiring the energy with which the crew worked. Ordinarily they were by no means a smart
crew, and did their work in a slow and slovenly manner; but each man now felt the importance
of getting everything into order before an enemy appeared, and so well did they work that by
midday the new mast was in its place, and before sunset the topmast with all its yards and
gear was up and the sails ready for hoisting.

Ralph had been in a state of anxiety in the early part of the night lest he should be sent
on board the bark and carried as a prisoner to France. But no one seemed to give a thought
to him, and it was not until far on in the morning that the captain happened to notice him
hard at work with the rest.

"Ah, are you there?" he said. "If I had thought of it I should have sent you into Best in the
bark."

Ralph did not understand the words but he guessed at the meaning, and said, smiling, "I am
quite content to remain where I am."

"Tell him, Jacques Clery, that I have noticed that he works willingly, and as long as he behaves
well he shall have the same treatment as if he belonged really to the crew; but warn him that
if he is caught at any time making a signal, or doing anything to warn a vessel we may be approaching,
his brains will be blown out at once."

Jacques translated the warning.

"That's all right," Ralph said. "Of course I should expect nothing else."

As soon as the repairs were completed the sails were hoisted and the brig proceeded on her
way. In the days that followed it seemed to Ralph that the tactics of the privateer had changed,
and that there was no longer any idea of making prizes. A sharp lookout was indeed kept for
any English cruisers, but no attention was paid to any sail in the distance as soon as it was
determined that these were not ships of war. Four days later, instead of there being as before
five or six sail in sight at one point or other of the horizon, the sea was absolutely deserted.
He remarked upon this to his friend Jacques. The latter laughed.

"We are out of their course now, my lad. We passed the latitude of Cape St. Vincent yesterday
evening, and we are now pretty well off the coast of Africa. Nine out of ten of the ships we
have seen were either bound to the Mediterranean or on their way home. Now that we have passed
the mouth of the strait we shall not run across many sail."

"Where are we going to, then?" Ralph said.

"Well, I don't think there is any harm in telling you now, that we are bound south, but how
far is more than I know. I expect first we shall go west and try and pick up some prizes among
the islands, and after that perhaps go round the cape and lie in wait for Indiamen on their
way home. You see, one of those ships is worth a dozen of these Mediterranean traders, and
one is not bothered down there as one is between the strait and the channel with your cruisers
and privateers; they swarm so there that one can hardly fire a gun without bringing them down
on us. I don't suppose the captain would have meddled with that Indiaman if it hadn't been
that he thought the owners would be pleased by a prize being sent in so soon. As to the bark,
we were obliged to take her to get a new mast. It would never have done to have started on
a long cruise with a badly-injured spar."

"But I should think it would be difficult to send home prizes from the West Indies," Ralph said.

"Well, you see, although you have taken most of our islands, there are still two or three ports
we can take prizes into. Beside, we can take the best goods out, and if the ship isn't worth
the risk of sending to France burn her. Then, too, one can spare hands for prizes better there;
because one can always ship a few fresh hands--Spaniards, Mulattos, or blacks--in their place."

"But you can't do that in the case of the Indiamen."

"No; but a single laden Indiaman is enough to pay us well for all our trouble. We can put a
crew of thirty hands on board her and send her home. There is little risk of a recapture till
we get near France. We have only to hoist the English flag if we do happen to meet anything."

Ralph was glad to hear that the ship was bound for the West Indies, as he thought opportunities
for escape would be likely to present themselves among the islands. Madeira was sighted three
days later, and after running south for another four or five hundred miles, the brig bore away
for the west. By dint of getting Jacques Clery to translate sentences into French, and of hearing
nothing but that language spoken round him, Ralph had by this time begun to make considerable
progress in the language. Not only was he anxious to learn it for the sake of passing away
the time and making himself understood, but his efforts were greatly stimulated by the fact
that if any of the crew addressed him in French a cuff on the head was generally the penalty
of a failure to comprehend him. The consequence was that when six weeks after sailing the cry
of land was shouted by the lookout in the tops, Ralph was able to understand almost everything
that was said, and to reply in French with some fluency. As the brig sailed along the wooded
shores of the first island they fell in with, Ralph was leaning against the bulwarks watching
with deep interest the objects they were passing.

"I can guess what you are thinking about," Jacques Clery said, taking his place quietly by
his side. "I have been through it all myself and I can guess your feelings. You are thinking
how you can escape. Now, you take my advice and don't you hurry about it. You are doing well
where you are. Now you begin to talk French and understand orders it's a good deal easier for
you than it was, and the men are beginning to regard you as one of themselves; but you may
be sure that you will be watched for a time. You see, they daren't let you go. If you were
to get to one of the English ports here we should have five or six of your men-of-war after
us in no time.

"If it was not for that I don't suppose the captain would object to put you ashore. He has
evidently taken a fancy to you, and is pleased with the way in which you have taken things
and with your smartness and willingness. Beside, I don't think he considers you altogether
as a prisoner. Running you down in the way we did in the channel wasn't like capturing you
in a prize, and I think if the captain could see his way to letting you go without risk to
himself he would do it. As he can't do that he will have a sharp watch kept on you, and I advise
you not to be in any hurry to try to escape. You must remember if you were caught trying it
they would shoot you to a certainty."

"I should be in no hurry at all, Jacques, if it were not that the brig is hunting for English
vessels. You know what you would feel yourself if you were on board a ship that was capturing
French craft."

"Yes, that is hard, no doubt," Jacques agreed; "and I don't say to you don't escape when you
get a chance, I only say wait until the chance is a good one. Just at present we are not specially
on the lookout for prizes. We are going to join two other vessels belonging to the same owners.
They have been out here some time and have got a snug hiding-place somewhere, though I don't
think any one on board except the captain knows where."

For three weeks the brig cruised among the islands. They had picked up no prizes in that time,
as the captain did not wish to commence operations until he had joined his consorts and obtained
information from them as to the British men-of-war on the station. They had overhauled one
or two native craft, purchased fish and fruit, and cautiously asked questions as to the cruisers.
The answers were not satisfactory. They learned that owing to the numbers of vessels that had
been captured by the privateers a very vigilant lookout was being kept; that two or three French
craft that had been captured by the cruisers had been bought into the service, and were constantly
in search of the headquarters of the privateers. This was bad news; for although the brig with
her great spread of canvas could in light winds run away from any of the ships of war, it was
by no means certain she would be able to do so from the converted privateers.

One morning two vessels--a schooner and a brig--were seen coming round a headland. The captain
and officers examined them with their telescopes, and a flag was run up to the masthead. Almost
immediately two answering flags were hoisted by the strangers, and an exclamation of satisfaction
broke from the captain:

"We are in luck," he said. "If we had not run across them we might have had to search for the
rendezvous. I have got the spot marked down on the chart, but they told me before sailing that
they understood it was very difficult to find the entrance, and we might pass by within a hundred
yards without noticing it."

In half an hour the ships closed up together, and the captains of the other crafts came on
board in their boats. A hearty greeting was exchanged between them and the captain of La Belle
Marie, and the three then descended to the cabin. After a time they reappeared, and the visitors
returned to their respective ships. Five minutes later the schooner got under way, and La Belle
Marie followed her, leaving the other brig to continue her cruise alone. Toward evening the
schooner ran in toward a precipitous cliff, the brig keeping close in her wake. Ralph had no
doubt that they were now close to the spot the privateers used as their rendezvous, but he
could detect no opening into the cliff ahead, and it looked as if the schooner was leading
the way to destruction. Not until within a cable's length of the shore could any opening be
discovered by the keenest eye. Then when the schooner was within her own length of the cliff
her helm was put about. She came round, and in a moment later disappeared. An exclamation of
surprise broke from all on board the brig, for they now saw that instead of the cliff stretching
in an unbroken line it projected out at one point, and the precipitous headway concealed an
extremely narrow passage behind it.

A moment later the brig imitated the maneuver of the schooner and passed in between two lofty
cliffs, so close that there were but a few yards to spare on either side of her. Fifty yards
ahead the channel made a sharp turn again, and they entered a basin of tranquil water three
or four hundred yards across. At the further end the shore sloped gradually up, and here several
large storehouses had been erected, and ways laid down for the convenience of hauling up and
repairing the vessels.

"What do you think of that, youngster?" Jacques said exultantly. "A grand hiding-place is it not?"

"It is indeed," Ralph replied. "Why, they might cruise outside for weeks looking for the place
and they wouldn't find it, unless a boat happened to row along at the foot of the cliffs."

"I should say you were right in what you said last night, captain. They must have got an idea
that our rendezvous is somewhere hereabouts, though they don't know for certain where, and
they are searching all the island round. If they come along here like that we shall be caught
in a trap. A vessel might sail close by without suspecting there was an entrance here, however
hard they might be looking for it; but if they send boats rowing along the shore they couldn't
help finding it. Still, there is nothing to prevent our sailing away now, as the island is
between us and them."

"That is so," the captain said. "But if they come while we are away, in the first place they
would capture all the booty in the stores, and in the second place they might lie quiet in
the harbor and would sink the other ships when they returned. I will go down to the port again,
Jacques, and will send up two of the men from the storehouse to keep watch here, turn and turn
about. Do you remain here until you are relieved. I will leave my glass with you. If there
is anything fresh, leave the boy on watch and come down with the news yourself. I must talk
this matter over with the mates. We have no direct interest in the stores, but we must do the
best we can for our owners."

Jacques and Ralph watched the distant boats through the glass until they disappeared round
the end of the island, then turned the glass seaward. Jacques was using it at the time. "See!"
he exclaimed, "there are three sails together there."

"I can see them plainly enough," Ralph said. "What do you make them out to be?"

"A schooner, a brig, and a three-masted vessel. They are lying close together, and I fancy
boats are passing between them. However, I couldn't swear to that. They must be fifteen miles
away. I expect they are our consorts, and a merchantman they have captured."

"Can they see them from the other side of that island?" Ralph asked excitedly.

"I should say they could," Jacques replied after pausing to calculate the line of sight. "It
depends how far round the frigate is lying, and how close in shore. But if they have sent any
one up on the hill there, of course they can make them out as plainly as we can." Jacques handed
the glass to Ralph.

"Yes, I think I can make out boats, Jacques. What do you suppose they are doing?"

"Most likely they are transferring the valuable part of her cargo on board."

"What will they do with her then?"

"I expect they will let her go; but of course that depends whether she is a new ship and worth
taking the risk of carrying her to France."

"They don't burn or sink her, then?"

"No; there would be no good in that; for they wouldn't know what to do with the crew. Of course
they don't want the bother of prisoners here, and they wouldn't want to turn them adrift in
the boats. They might land on some island near and see us going and coming here, and carry
the news to some of your cruisers. No, I expect they will take what is valuable and let them
go--that is if the ship isn't worth sending home. I suppose that is so in this case; for if
they were going to put a prize crew on board and send it to France, they would not be transferring
the cargo. Well, we shall see in another half hour."

CHAPTER V.

THE BRITISH CRUISERS.

An hour passed. During this time the watchers on the hill saw that the brig had been lying
alongside the three-masted vessel, and felt sure that the cargo was being transferred, then
the merchantman's sails were hoisted, and she slowly sailed away. For another hour the other
two crafts lay motionless, then they hoisted sail and headed for the island. There was a brisk,
steady wind blowing, and they came along fast through the water.

"We shall soon see now whether your frigate has made them out," Jacques said; "but I will not
wait any longer but will go and tell the captain what is going on. In another hour the others
will be up here to relieve you, then you can bring down the latest news."

Left alone, Ralph watched anxiously the progress of the distant vessels, turning the glass
frequently toward the other island, beyond the end of which he momentarily expected to see
the white sails of the frigate appear. An hour passed. The schooner and the brig were now within
about four miles of the nearest point of the island, and still there were no signs of the English
ship. Presently he heard voices behind him, and two French sailors came up. Ralph was now free
to return, but he thought he had better wait until the brig and schooner reached a point where
they would be hidden by the island from the sight of any-one who might be watching on the hill
six miles away.

In another half-hour they had reached this point. No signs had been seen of the frigate, and
Ralph felt sure that she must have been anchored in some bay whose headland prevented her seeing
the approaching craft; for had she noticed them she would assuredly have set out to intercept
them before they reached the island, which lay almost dead to windward of them. He was just
turning to go when one of the men gave a sudden exclamation. He turned round again and saw
the frigate just appearing from behind the other island. She was close-hauled, and it was soon
evident by her course that she was beating up for the point round which the other two ships
had disappeared.

Ralph was puzzled at this; for if she had made out the brig and schooner, her natural course
would have been to have made for the other end of the island, so as to cut them off as they
sailed past it; whereas they would now, when they gained the extremity of the island, find
themselves five or six miles astern of the other two craft. The French sailors were equally
puzzled, and there was a hot argument between them; but they finally concluded that her appearance
at that moment must be accidental, and she could not have made out the privateers. They had
just told Ralph to run down with the news to the harbor when a light was thrown upon the mystery;
for from the other end of the island from which the frigate had emerged a large schooner appeared.
Every sail was set, and her course was directed toward this other end of the island upon which
the watchers were standing. The two French sailors burst out into a torrent of oaths, expressive
of surprise and alarm; for it was evident that from the course the schooner was taking she
intended to intercept the two privateers, and engage them until the frigate came to her assistance.

"Run, boy! run for your life!" one of them exclaimed, "and tell the captain. But no; wait a
moment," and he directed the glass upon the schooner. "A thousand curses!" he exclaimed. "It
is the Cerf schooner the English captured from us six months ago. She is the fastest craft
in these waters. Tell the captain that I am coming after you, but your legs will beat mine."

Ralph dashed off at full speed, but as soon as he had fairly distanced the French sailor he
began to run more slowly. For the moment he had so entered into the feelings of his companions
that he had identified himself with them, but now he had time to think, his sympathies swung
round to the English ship. He did not particularly want La Belle Marie to be captured; for
he had been so well treated on board her that he felt no ill-will toward her. But her capture
meant his deliverance.

He thought over the matter as he ran, and wondered first why the frigate did not take the line
to cut the privateers off, instead of going round by the other end of the island. He could
only suppose that it was because the schooner was the fastest vessel, and was more likely to
arrive in time at the point. Beside, if she showed there before the privateers reached the
point they might double back again, and the frigate would make the other end of the island
before they were halfway back. It might be, too, that the captain has suspected the truth,
knowing that the privateers had a rendezvous somewhere in that neighborhood, and that his object
in remaining so long behind the island was to give them time to enter their port in ignorance
of his being in the neighborhood. At any rate, the great thing was, that the schooner and brig
should enter the little harbor before knowing that they were pursued. Once in, it would be
impossible for them to get out again and beat off shore with the wind blowing dead on the land,
before both the schooner and frigate had rounded their respective ends of the island.

Therefore, although Ralph ran fast enough to keep well ahead of the sailor, he made no effort
to keep up a greater rate of speed than was necessary for this. As soon as he reached the shore
a boat rowed off from the brig to fetch him. He saw with satisfaction that although the men
were all on board, no preparations were made for getting under way at once; and, indeed, the
captain would have no anxiety for his own ship, as he would know that the privateers, if they
saw the frigate coming out to meet them, would sail right away from the island, and the frigate
would be sure to pursue until out of sight of land.

"What news, boy?" the captain asked as the boat came close alongside. "Is the frigate in chase
of the others?"

"Yes, sir," Ralph replied; "the frigate and a schooner are both in chase."

"Which way are they bearing?"

"The privateers do not know they are chased sir. The frigate did not show round the island
over there until the schooner and brig were hidden behind the end of this island. She made
toward the western end, and the schooner is making for the eastern end. The sailors who came
up told me to tell you that the schooner is the Cerf, one of the fastest vessels out here."

The captain uttered an exclamation of dismay, which was echoed by those standing round him.

"Row out through the entrance," he shouted to the coxswain of the boat, "and warn the others
of the danger! Tell them to make straight out. If they come in here, we shall all be caught
in a trap together!"

The oars dipped in the water, but before the boat was fairly in motion there was an exclamation,
for the head sail of the schooner glided in past the projecting cliff. A moment later the whole
vessel came into view.

"Bring the boat back alongside!" the captain shouted. "I will go on board her at once. She
may get out in time yet!"

As the schooner rounded up her sails came down, and she headed straight toward the brig. The
captain of the Belle Marie stood up in the stern-sheet of the boat, shouting and waving his
hands and gesticulating to them to get up sail again. Those on board the schooner looked on
in surprise, unable to guess his meaning.

"There are two English cruisers, one coming round each end of the island!" he shouted as he
approached the schooner. "Get out again if you can, otherwise they must catch us all in here!"

The captain in the schooner at once saw the emergency, and roared out orders. The boats were
all lowered at once, and the men tumbled on board. Hawsers were lowered from the bows, and
they began at once to tow her head round, for there was not a breath of wind in the land-locked
harbor.

"How much time have we got?" the captain asked as the schooner's head came slowly round.

"I don't know," the other captain replied. "It's a question of minutes, anyhow. Ah, here is
the brig!" and the boat dashed forward and he gave similar orders to those that had been given
to the schooner.

"Get them both round!" the captain shouted. "I will row out through the entrance and give you
warning if these accursed cruisers are in sight."

The boat dashed through the narrow entrance, and at once felt the full force of the breeze.
"Dead on shore," the captain muttered bitterly. "They will have to work right out into the
arms of one or other of them."

They rowed a hundred yards out, when, beyond the furthermost point they could see to the east,
the sails of the schooner were perceived.

"Take her round," the captain said sharply. "It's too late now, we have got to fight for it."

They rowed back through the entrance. The schooner slowly towed by her boats was approaching.

"It is no use," the captain said, "you are too late. The schooner has rounded the end of the
island, and with this breeze will be here in half an hour. You never can work out in time.
Beside, they would see you come out; and even if you got away, which you couldn't do, they
would come back and capture the depot. We have got to fight for it, that's evident; and the
boats of a fleet could hardly make their way in here. We had best get the three craft moored
with their broadsides to the entrance. We will blow the boats to tinder if they try to come
in, and then we can load up with all the most valuable goods and slip out at night-time. That
is our only chance."

The captain of the schooner jumped into the boat, and they again rowed out into the entrance.
He saw at once that the other's advice was the only one to be followed. It would be impossible
to beat off the shore before the schooner came up and while they were talking the frigate appeared
round the other end of the island. They therefore returned into the harbor. The Belle Marie's
anchor was raised, and the three vessels moored head and stern across the harbor, a hundred
yards from the entrance. As soon as this was done strong parties were sent ashore from each
of the vessels, and six heavy ship's guns that had been landed from some captured vessel were
dragged from their place near the storehouse and planted on the heights, so as to sweep the
narrow channel.

It was late in the evening before this was finished, and an earthwork thrown up to shelter
the men working the guns from musketry fire. In the meantime the two ships of war had met outside,
and again separating cruised several times from end to end of the rocky wall, evidently searching
for the entrance through which the privateers they had been pursuing had so suddenly disappeared.
In the morning the French sailors were at work early, and two or three strong chains were fastened
across the mouth of the passage.

"Now," the captain of the Belle Marie said exultantly, as he regained the deck of his ship,
"we are ready to give them a warm reception. The boats of all the British cruisers on the station
would never force their way through that gap."

Ralph had not been called upon to assist in the work of preparation, he and Jacques having
done their day's work on the journey to the top of the hill and back. He saw from the exultation
in the faces of the Frenchmen that they considered their position was impregnable, and he shuddered
at the thought of the terrible carnage that would ensue if the boats of the English vessels
should try to force an entrance. The following morning a lookout on the cliffs reported that
two boats had left the ships and were rowing toward the shore. On reaching the foot of the
cliffs they rowed along abreast at a distance of thirty or forty yards of the shores. They
stopped rowing at the mouth of the entrance, and were suddenly hailed by the captain of the
schooner, who was standing on the cliff above.

"If you try to enter," he said, "you will be destroyed at once. We don't want to harm you if
you will leave us alone; but we have guns enough to blow a whole fleet out of water, and will
use them if we are driven to it."

"Thank you for your warning," a voice shouted back from the boats, and then an order was given,
and they rowed back to the ships.

"Well, have you found the place, Lieutenant Pearson?" the captain of the frigate asked as the
young lieutenant stepped on deck.

"Yes, sir, we have found it. It is just where the boat turned and came out again."

"I can see no signs of it now," the captain said, examining the shore with his telescope.

"No, sir; you wouldn't until you were within a hundred yards of it. But rowing close in as
we were we saw it some time before we got there. The rocks overlap each other, and there is
a narrow channel some fifty yards long between them. Apparently this makes a sharp turn at
the other end and opens out. We saw nothing of the vessels we were chasing yesterday, but on
high ground facing the channel there is a battery of six guns planted so as to rake anything
coming in. There are some chains across the end. While we were lying on our oars there we were
hailed." And he then repeated the warning that had been given.

"Nasty place to get into--eh?" the captain said thoughtfully.

"Very nasty, sir. You see, the guns would play right down into the channel; then there are
the chains to break down, and perhaps more batteries, and certainly the ships to tackle when
we get inside."

"Is there width for the frigate to enter?" the captain asked.

"Just width, I should say, and no more, sir. We should certainly have to get the yards braced
fore and aft, but the ship herself would go through with something to spare, I should say."

"What depth of water is there close in shore?"

"Plenty of depth sir, right up to the foot of the cliffs; but of course I can say nothing as
to the depth in the channel."

"No, of course not," the captain said. "Well, it's something that we have run these pests to
earth at last, but I see it is going to be no easy matter to get at them."

The captain now signaled to the captain of the schooner to come on board, and when he did so
the two officers retired to the cabin together and had a long consultation. The young officer
on coming on deck got into his boat, and taking Lieutenant Pearson with him rowed for the cliffs,
a few hundred yards to the west of the inlet. Here they could obtain a view of the channel
and its surroundings. Not a man was to be seen. The muzzles of the six guns pointed menacingly
down into the passage, and the chains could be seen just above the water's edge.

"I think we will go back now, Mr. Pearson. I really think we ought to be very much obliged
to those fellows for not sinking us. I wonder what was their motive in letting us off so easily?"

"I suppose they feel pretty confident that our report is not likely to encourage an attack,
and they think that if they were to blow us to pieces it would only make Captain Wilson the
more determined to destroy them. At least that is the conclusion I came to as I rowed back
last time."

"Yes, I should think that is it," the young captain said. "It is certainly as awkward a looking
place to attack in boats as I ever saw. Of course were it not for the chains my vessel could
get in, and I dare say she has been in there many a time before we captured her, but it would
be a very risky thing to take the frigate in without knowing anything of the depth of water
either in the channel or inside."

Both returned to the frigate. "Mr. Pearson's report is fully borne out, Captain Wilson. It
would be a most desperate enterprise to attack with our boats. Half of them would be sunk before
they got to the chains; and even if they got past them, which I doubt, there is no saying what
difficulties and obstacles may be inside."

"And now about the frigate, Captain Chambers."

"Well, sir, that is for you to decide. I am quite ready to take the schooner in; though with
the plunging power of that battery raking her fore and aft I say fairly that it would be a
desperate enterprise, and if she had not sufficient way upon her to carry away the chains nothing
could save her. As to the frigate, it seems to me that she would run an equal risk with the
schooner, with the additional danger that there may not be water enough for her."

"Well, it certainly doesn't seem to be an easy nut to crack," Captain Wilson said. "As we agreed
before you started, we should not be justified in risking both our vessels in assaulting a
place which is certainly extremely formidable, and where there may not be water enough for
the frigate to float. Still the question remains, what is to be done? It is no use anchoring
here and trying to starve them out; they may have provisions enough to last them for years,
for anything we know. If the weather were to turn bad we should have to make off at once; it
would never do to be caught in a hurricane with such a coast as that on our lee. I might send
you to Port Royal with a letter to the admiral, asking him to send us two or three more ships;
but I don't like doing that when it is a mere question of capturing two rascally privateers."

"I think the admiral would be glad to send them," the younger captain said; "for these two
vessels have done a tremendous lot of damage during the last year. I believe that upward of
twenty ships have reported being boarded and stripped by them."

"But if they came what could they do?" Captain Wilson asked. "You see we consider it is not
worth the risk of throwing away two ships two force this passage, still less would it be to
risk four."

"That is so, no doubt," Captain Chambers agreed. "I should suggest that however many of us
there may be we should all draw off and keep a watch at a distance. Of course it would be necessary
to approach at night, and to lie behind the island somewhere in the daytime just as we did
yesterday, for from the top of that hill they can see any distance round."

"Yes, and as soon as it is dusk they will have two or three hours to get away before we can
come round here. Beside, with their night-glasses from the top of the cliffs they will be sure
to be able to make us out. There is only one other way that I can see of getting at them, that
is to find a landing-place and attack them from on shore."

"Ah! that's much more hopeful business. As far as I saw yesterday there are cliffs all round
the island; but it is hard indeed if we cannot find some place where we can manage to effect
a landing.

"This is the plan we must follow out. This afternoon an hour before it gets dark you get up
sail and make away as if you were bound for Port Royal. I shall keep my station here. They
will think you have gone off to get some more ships. As soon as it is thoroughly dark bear
round and come back to the island; bring the schooner in close to the cliffs on the other side
and get into a bay if you can find one. You will then be out of sight altogether unless somebody
happens to look down from the edge of the cliffs above you.

"Then search the whole of the back of the island with boats, keeping at oar's length from the
cliffs. There must be some places where a man can climb up, probably gulleys worn by streams.
Then to-morrow night sail round and join us again. I will be waiting for you about two miles
off the land, and will show a light to seaward so that you will know where to find me. Then
we can talk matters over, and you can get back to the other side again before morning."

While the captains of the two English vessels were holding consultations a similar talk was
going on between the three captains of the privateers, and the conclusion they arrived at was
precisely similar to that of the English officers. Them had been the esthesis when the past one,
with the custody of kid that cannot lecture, stir her buccula and ma, prevail in set her thumb
in her oculus, breathe them were again delivered on the eyelid, and
it keep them were travel over front, tickling and torture her muster with

extremity, as the rod, upon whose guards the stem, writhe and parched
yells, were handful to mount, the place of the rectangle of kale,

playfully in her, behind the boundary of the water, the men of hedge

On the Jupillon Somerset had british angling, and its Germinie learn

"Leer that you, soma," them killed Dominicus from his plank, and up one of the hottest years
were into August, to the provincial who was observe they,-- "do them
cognize they had not been win'mt at the louse worth less coin?"

 An arrangement had been made between
the captains that the Belle Marie should transfer her cargo to the first vessel worth sending
to France that she captured, receiving as her share one-third of its value if it reached port
safely.

The captain of the Belle Marie was well content with this arrangement, for the storehouses
contained the spoils of upward of twenty ships, and his share would therefore be a considerable
one, and he would only have to carry the cargo till he fell in with an English merchantman.
All speculation as to the British schooner's whereabouts was put an end to the next morning,
by a message from Captain Vipon saying she had been discovered lying close in under the cliffs
at the back of the island, and that her boats were already examining the shore. An hour later
the captain himself arrived.

"It is as I feared," he said when he joined the other captains; "there are three bays about
two miles apart and at all of these a landing could be easily effected. The land slopes gradually
down to the edge of the sea. They might land at any of them, and of course the guns of the
schooner would cover the landing if we opposed it."

"Still we might beat them back," one of the others said. "We can muster about three hundred
men between us, and they are not likely to land more than that."

"I don't think that would be a good plan," Captain Vipon said. "To begin with, we can't tell
which of the three places they may choose for landing at. We certainly cannot hurry through
the woods anything like so fast as they can row along the shore, so that would place us at
a disadvantage. In the second place, you know very well that we can't rely upon our men defeating
an equal number of these John Bulls; and in the last place, we should not gain much if we did.
We should lose a tremendous lot of our men, and the schooner would go off and fetch two or
three more ships of war here, so that in the end they must beat us. I think that there is no
question that it will be better for us to take our chances of escape now."

"Either the schooner will come back to-night and tow the boats of the frigate round the other
side of the island, or she will send a boat with the news that she has found a landing-place,
and then the frigate will send all her boats. I don't think the attack will take place to-night;
but it may be made. It certainly won't if the schooner comes round, for the wind is very light.
She will not leave her anchorage until it is quite dark; and by the time she has got round
to the frigate, and the boat's crews are ready to start, and they all get to the back of the
island, it will be morning. If they send a boat it would reach the frigate after three hours'
rowing; give them an hour to get ready and start, and three hours to row back, so that brings
it to nearly the same thing. Beside, I don't suppose in any case they would land before morning,
for they would run the risk of losing their way in the woods. So my proposal is that at about
two o'clock in the morning we make a start, separate as soon as we get out of the harbor, and
each shift for himself. The frigate will have more than half her crew away, and being so short-handed
will not be so smart with her sails, and will not be able to work half her guns; so that at
the outside two out of the three of us ought to get safely off."

"But suppose that the schooner happens to be round here, and they make up their minds to wait
a day before attacking, we should have two of them after us then; and that schooner sails like
a witch."

"I have thought of that," Captain Vipon said. "My idea is to put a man on the top of the cliff
just above where the schooner is anchored. If she is lying there he is to light a fire a short
distance back from the edge of the cliff. There should be another man on the top of the hill.
When he sees the fire he shall show a lantern three times. We will return the signal to let
him know that we see it. If the schooner goes away early in the evening the lookout is not
to light the fire until he sees her returning, at whatever hour it may be. The moment we see
the light we will set sail.'

"But how about the two signallers?" one of the other captains said. "They would be left behind
and might not get the chance of rejoining us again."

"I have thought of that too," Captain Vipon, said. "I have an English lad on board whom I picked
up in the channel. He is a smart lad, and has been working as one of the crew. He would of
course be glad to stay behind, because it will give him the chance of rejoining his friends."

"That would do capitally. But how about the other man? You see, if he showed himself he would
be made prisoner and sent to England; if he didn't show himself he might be on this island
for years before he got a chance of joining a French ship. It would need a high bribe to induce
anybody to run such a risk as that."

This was so evident that there was silence for two or three minutes, then Captain Vipon spoke
again. "I have a man who would be more likely to do it than any one else I think, because he
has taken a strong fancy to this young English boy. He is a good hand, and I don't like losing
him; still the thing is so important that I should not hesitate at that. Still we must offer
him something good to run the risk, or rather the certainty of imprisonment. I propose that
his name shall be put down on the books of all three ships, so that if he ever gets back to
France again he will have a fair certainty of a good lot of prize money, for it will be hard
luck if two out of the three of us do not manage to get back safely." The other captains agreed
to this.

"He will be here in half an hour," Captain Vipon said. "The men were sitting down to a meal
when I came away, and I ordered them to make their way back as soon as they had done. If he
refuses, the only other way I can see will be for all the men to cast lots, when, of course,
whoever stays would get his three shares as we agreed."

Half an hour later the twenty men arrived from the other side of the island. As soon as they
came on board Captain Vipon called Jacques into the cabin and told him that it would be necessary
to leave two men behind, explaining the duties they would have to perform.

"Now Jacques," he said when he had finished, "I thought that perhaps you would be more likely
than any other man on board the three ships to volunteer for this work."

"I volunteer!" Jacques said in astonishment. "What should make you think of such a thing, captain?"

"For this reason, Jacques: I have settled to leave the English lad here as one of the signallers.
Of course he will gladly undertake the job, as it will enable him to join his friends when
they land; and as you like him and he likes you, he might be able to make things easy for you.
In the second place we have determined that the name of whoever stops shall be borne on the
ship books of all three vessels to the end of their cruise, so that there would be a good bit
of money coming even if only one out of the three ships gets back, and enough to set you up
for life if all three get back safely. Of course you may have a spell of imprisonment; but
it is likely that one at least of the ships may be caught going out to-night, and if it happened
to be ours you would get the prison without the prize-money."

"That is so," Jacques agreed. "If you give me half an hour to think it over I will give you
an answer. It's come upon me sudden-like. I will talk it over with the boy. I suppose I can
tell him, captain?"

On regaining the deck Jacques looked about for Ralph.

"Come and sit along with me out on the bowsprit, lad, I want to have a private talk with you."

Somewhat surprised Ralph followed his friend out on to the bowsprit.

"Now, boy," he said, "I have got a bit of news to tell you that will be pleasant to you. That's
the first thing; and the next is, I want your advice. You are a sensible young chap, you are,
although you are but a lad, and I should like to know what you think about it."

"Well, what's the good news, Jacques?"

"The good news is this; you are likely, before this time to-morrow, to be with your friends."
Ralph gave such a start of delight that he nearly slipped off the bowsprit.

"How is that Jacques? It seems too good to be true."

"This is the way of it," Jacques said. "The three vessels are all going to cut and run to-night.
That schooner of yours is round the other side of the island, and we want to be sure she is
stopping there, then there will only be the frigate to deal with, and in these light winds
and dark nights we ought to be able to give her the slip; but the only way to be sure the schooner
keeps the other side is to watch her. So one man is to be placed on the cliff above her, and
at two o'clock in the morning, if she is still there, he is to light a fire well back from
the cliff, so that the light will not be seen by her. Another man is to be on the top of the
hill, where we were together with a lantern. You see, we can just see the top of the hill from
here. When he sees the fire he is to show a light three times. If he sees it answered here
he will know it's all right, and his work is done; if not, of course he shows the lights again
until it's answered. Now, they are going to leave you as one of the two signallers, and of
course all you will have to do will be to wait for a bit, and then come down and join your
friends."

"That is capital," Ralph said. "Nothing could be better. Now, what is the other matter that
you want my advice about, Jacques?"

"Well, you see, it will be awkward for the other man, for he will either have the choice of
coming down and giving himself up and being carried off as a prisoner, or of stopping on this
island perhaps for years till a French ship happens to come along; for once off the Marie will
continue her cruise to the Indian seas, and the other two will make straight for France. Of
course there is another course which might be taken. A boat might be hidden away for him, and
he might go for a cruise on his own account and take the chance of being picked up.

"Well, they have offered to the man as stops to put his name down on the books of all the three
craft. That means, of course, that he will get a share in the prize-money of all three ships
if they get back. That's a pretty good offer, you know. You see, a fellow on board may get
captured or killed in battle or wrecked, and in that case there would not be a penny of prize-money.
The man who stops here is sure of prize-money if only one of the three craft get back to France.
Now, they ask me if I will undertake it. I should be better off than the others; because in
the first place I shall have you to talk with till I get to prison, and in the next place as
I can talk English I can get on a good deal better in prison than other fellows would do. Now,
what's your advice, lad?"

"I should say certainly accept the offer, Jacques. You see, I can tell them all what a good
friend you have been to me, and it maybe they will let you go free; but even if they don't
I could make it pleasant for you with the men, and you may be sure that if they take you to
an English prison I will do all I can to get you out of it. You see, when you get back to France
you would have really a good sum coming to you from these three ships. The two that have been
out here have collected a tremendous lot of valuable plunder, and the Bell Marie is likely
to get quite as much if, as you say, she is going to spend two years out in the Indian seas.
So I really think you would be wise to take the offer. Another thing, if you like I will not
show myself at all, but will stop here with you, and we will take a boat together and make
for some port, where we can give out that we are shipwrecked sailors."

"No, lad, that wouldn't do; though I thank you for your offer. You might get a ship back to
England, but I should have very little chance of getting one for France."

"No; but we might get one together for America, and from there you might get to France easily
enough."

Jacques thought for some minutes. "No, lad; I will give myself up with you. We might get lost
in a boat, seeing that neither of us know the geography of these seas; we might get short of
water, or caught in a hurricane. No, I will give myself up. I know the worst that way, anyhow.
Another spell in an English prison; but from that I may either get exchanged, or escape, or
the war come to an end. So that's the best thing for me to do."

CHAPTER VI.

HOME AGAIN.

Having decided to stay as one of the signallers, Jacques proceeded at once to the captain's cabin.

"I am glad you have decided so, Jacques. It would have been a troublesome business to cast
lots, and some of the men might have absolutely refused doing so; so I am glad it's settled.
I have arranged with the other captains that you shall have an advance of twenty napoleons.
You had best hide them about you; you may find them come in useful. The boy is to have ten.
Of course he is glad of the chance; but at the same time he is doing us good service, and he
has worked well since he came on board. It will help him to get a passage home."

"Thank you, captain. That twenty napoleons may help me to get out of an English prison. I will
manage a hiding place for them. And now I think, captain, we will be off at once--at least
as soon as we have had our dinner. It's a good long way across the island to where that schooner
was lying, and I shall have to choose a place for my fire so that it can be seen from the top
of the hill."

At dinner Jacques told his comrades that he was going to remain behind and act as signalman
for them. A good deal of regret was expressed by his shipmates, many of whom came like himself
from Dunkirk, and had known him from a boy. Before starting he went to the sailmaker and got
him to open the soles of his shoes; he then inserted ten napoleons in each, and the sailmaker
sewed them up again. Then making his clothes into a kit and getting a couple of bottles of
wine from the steward, he shook hands with his messmates, and was with Ralph rowed ashore.

On landing they cut two sticks and hung their kits upon these, Ralph taking charge of the lantern,
while both were provided with tinder and steel.

They walked for half a mile together, and then Jacques said:

"Here our paths separate, lad; you can't miss your way to the top of the hill. I go almost
the other way, for the schooner lies but a short distance from the end of the island. If I
were you I should lie up for a sleep as soon as I get there. Remember you will not see my fire
till two o'clock. If you do not see it then you must keep watch till morning, for there's no
saying when it may be lit. As soon as you see it you show a light three times in the direction
of the creek. If you see it answered you will have nothing more to do; if not you must keep
on showing the light till you do get an answer. In the morning you wait till the sun has been
up an hour, then come to this spot and wait for me. I shall start at daybreak, but I have a
lot further to walk than you have, so I shan't be there before you. If we find your people
haven't come into the harbor we will wait till they do so; then when they find that there is
no one there we can show ourselves quietly; but if we got there first they might begin to shoot
directly they saw us without stopping to ask any questions."

Ralph made his way up to the top of the hill, threw himself down under some trees near the
summit, and was soon fast asleep. When he awoke it was already dark. He lit his lantern, covered
it up in his jacket, and took his station at the highest point. He had plenty to think about.
Another twelve hours and he would be with friends! He had no reason to complain of the treatment
he had received on board the privateer, but had he remained with her he might not have returned
to France for a couple of years, and would then have had difficulty in crossing to England;
beside, it was painful to him to be with men fighting against his country, and each prize taken
instead of causing delight to him as to his comrades, would have been a source of pain.

But most of all he thought of his mother, of how she must have grieved for him as dead, and
of the joy there would be at their reunion. The hours therefore passed quickly, and he could
scarcely believe it to be two o'clock when he suddenly saw the light of a fire far way toward
the end of the island. A glance at the stars showed him that the time was correct. He rose
to his feet, and taking the lantern held it aloft, then he lowered it behind a bush and twice
raised it again. He knew exactly the direction in which the harbor lay, and no sooner had he
put down the lantern for the third time than three flashes of light followed in close succession.

He knew that everything would be prepared in the afternoon for the start. Orders had been issued
before he left that the oars of the boats were to be muffled, that the chains at the entrance
of the channel were to be removed, and the ships got in a position, with shortened cables,
for a start. He could picture to himself, as he stood there gazing into the darkness, that
the men would be already in the boats awaiting his signal, and as soon as it was seen they
would begin to tow the vessels out of the harbor.

During the daytime the frigate cruised backward and forward under easy sail some two miles
off the entrance; but the sailors believed that at night she came very much closer to the shore,
the lookout with night-glasses having reported that she had been seen once or twice within
a quarter of a mile of the entrance to the channel.

Half an hour passed without any sign that the frigate was aware that the ships were leaving
the harbor; then Ralph heard the sound of a distant musket-shot, followed by several others,
and had no doubt that one of the frigate's boats on watch near the channel had discovered them.

A few minutes later there was a flash some distance out at sea, followed after an interval
by the deep boom of a gun; then came a broadside, followed by a steady fire of heavy guns.
These were evidently fired on board the frigate, no answering sounds from the French ships
meeting his ear. He could see by the direction of the flashes that the frigate was under way.
The firing continued for two hours, becoming more and more distant, and then it ceased altogether.

When the sun rose he saw the frigate some twenty miles away. There was a smaller craft two
or three miles further off, and two others were visible ten or twelve miles further away to
the west. Two of the privateers had evidently made their escape, and the third seemed to be
leaving her pursuer behind, for the wind was exceedingly light. Some miles nearer to the island
than the frigate a schooner was visible. She was heading for the two vessels that had gone
toward the west, but as these were fully fifteen miles to windward her chance of overtaking
them appeared to be slight. Ralph waited an hour, and then proceeded at a leisurely pace toward
the spot where he was to meet Jacques. He was but five minutes at the spot agreed upon when
he saw him coming through the trees.

"I heard nothing of the landing-parties," he said as the French sailor approached.

"The reason is not far to search for," he replied. "They did not land at all, and I did not
much expect that they would. The boats from the frigate arrived a few minutes before I lighted
my fire. I was lying down at the edge of the cliff, looking right down upon her deck. They
came up in a body, rowing with muffled oars. I could just hear the sound of their talking when
they came on deck. As soon as I had the fire fairly alight I saw your signal and then went
back to watch them. Everything was quiet till I heard the boom of the first gun; then I heard
'Silence!' ordered on the schooner. I suppose some one had said that he heard a gun, and other's
didn't. Of course the sound did not come to them under the shelter of the cliff as it did to
me. Then came the sound of another gun, and then three or four close together; then orders
were given sharply, the capstan was manned and the anchor run up, and they were not a minute
getting her sails set. But under the shelter of the cliff there was not enough wind to fill
them, and so the boats were manned, and she went gliding away until I could no longer make
her out. They guessed, of course, that our craft were making off, and went to help the frigate."

"They were too late to be of any use, Jacques."

"Ah! you have seen them from the top of the hill. I did not think of that. What is the news?"

"The frigate was in chase of one of them. It was too far for me to see which. I should say
he was two or three miles ahead, certainly well out of gunshot, and as far as I could see during
the hour I was watching them, was increasing her lead. Unless the wind freshens I think she
is safe. The other two were on the opposite tack, ten or twelve miles away to the west. The
schooner was heading after them, but was at least fifteen miles from them."

"She is very fast in a light wind like this, they say."

"Well, if she should catch them, they ought to be able to beat her off, Jacques, as they are
two to one. So far I think your chance of getting your three shares is a good one."

"Maybe, lad. I have not had much luck so far. I began on the sea when I was eleven. At twenty-one
I had to go into the navy, and it was seven years later when I got back to Dunkirk after that
spell in the prison. I did not report myself, for I had no wish to do any more man-of-wars'
work; and now I have had six years privateers' work, and have not made much by it. If I get
back this time and get those three shares I will buy a fine fishing smack for myself and a
snug little house on shore. There is some one I promised--if the voyage turned out well--she
should have a nice little house of her own, and she promised to wait for me. After that, no
more long voyages for me. I suppose we may as well go down to the harbor now, lad. They are
sure to come back sooner or later, whether they catch any of the privateers or not."

"Oh, yes! we shall be all safe now. We will be on the beach when they come in. When they see
that we are alone and unarmed there's no chance of their firing. We can go up occasionally
to the cliffs and watch for them."

It was not until the following evening that the frigate was seen approaching the island.

"She will take another four or five hours to work in," Jacques said, "and they are not likely
to try to land till to-morrow morning. All their boats and half their men are away in the schooner.
I should think she would be back to-morrow morning. Either she caught them before it got dark
last night--which I don't think likely--or they will have given her the slip in the night.
In that case she might look about for another day and then make sail to rejoin."

As Jacques predicted the schooner was seen by daylight eight or ten miles away.

"We may as well hoist a white flag, Jacques. The captain of the frigate will be savage that
all the privateers have escaped him, but it may put him into a good temper if he takes possession
here before the schooner arrives."

Ralph ran down to the storehouse, got hold of a sheet and an oar, and a white flag was soon
hoisted on the top of the cliff. Five minutes later two gigs were seen rowing off from the
frigate. Ralph and Jacques took their places on the battery. When the boats reached the mouth
of the narrow entrance the order was given for the men to lay on their oars. Ralph shouted
at the top of his voice:

"You can come on, sir! We are the only two here!"

The order was given to row on, and Ralph and his companion at once went down to meet them at
the end of the harbor. The captain himself was in the stern of his own gig, while a young lieutenant
held the lines in the other boat.

"Who are you? the captain asked, as he stepped ashore on the little wharf. You are English
by your speech."

"I am English, sir. I was on board a fishing boat in the channel when we were run down by one
of those privateers in the dark. I believe the fisherman with me was drowned, but I clung to
the bobstay and was got on board. She was on her way out here and had no opportunity of landing
me. She only arrived here two days before you came up."

"You are not a fisherman?" the captain said abruptly.

"No, sir; my mother is living at Dover, and I was at school there. I lost my father, who was
an architect, some years ago."

"And who is this who is with you?"

"He is a sailor in the brig I came out in, and has been extremely kind to me during the voyage,
and kept the others from persecuting me."

"How is it he is left behind?" the captain asked.

"He was round the other side of the island watching the schooner," Ralph replied, "and the
others sailed away without him;" for Ralph had agreed with Jacques that it was better to say
nothing about the signalling.

"Have you done any fighting since you were on board the privateer?" the captain asked sternly.

"No, sir. We have only exchanged shots with one ship since we sailed. She fired one broadside
and the privateer drew off a good deal damaged. Another was surprised by night, but I took
no part in it. I don't know what she was laden with or what was her name."

"Well, lad, your story sounds truthful, and will, of course, be inquired into when we get to
England. As to this man, he is of course a prisoner."

"I hope not, sir," Ralph pleaded. "He has not been taken with arms in his hands, and is, in
fact, a castaway mariner."

The captain's face relaxed into a smile. "I see you are a sort of sea lawyer. Well, we shall
see about it. What is there in these storehouses?"

"A quantity of things, sir. They took away a great many with them, but there must be ten times
as much left. I heard them say they had the cargoes of more than twenty ships here."

"That is satisfactory at any rate," the captain said. "Mr. Wylde, will you just take a look
round these storehouses and see what there is worth taking away. You had better take my boat's
crew as well as your own to help you to turn things over. Are you quite sure, lad, that there
is no one beside yourselves on the island?"

"I can't say that, sir. The orders were for all hands to embark last night, and so far as I
know none of them were left behind except Jacques Clery. We have been here for two days now
and have seen no one, so I do not think any one else can have been left."

"How did you get on on board the brig?" the captain asked. "I suppose you cannot speak French?"

"I couldn't speak any French when I first was got on board, sir, but I picked up a great deal
on the voyage out. Jacques speaks English very well. He was a prisoner in England for three
years, and learned it there, and it was that which caused him to speak to me directly he had
got me on board, for no one else understood me. So he set to work at once to help me in my
French, so that I could get along. The captain was very kind too. He said that as I had been
picked up in that way he should not treat me as a prisoner; but he expected me to make myself
useful, and, of course, I did so. It was the only way of having a comfortable life."

"Is this the only place the privateers had on shore here?" the captain asked, looking round.
"I only see one or two huts."

"The storekeepers lived in them, sir. They stopped behind to look after things when the privateers
were away. The men slept on board their vessels, only landing to disembark the cargoes they
had captured, and for a drunken spree when they first returned. I am sure they have no other
place."

"So your brig only arrived here four days ago? I was puzzled in the morning when I saw there
were two brigs and a schooner when we had only expected one brig. Of course your arrival accounts
for that. What was her name, and how many guns and men did she carry?"

"She was La Belle Marie of Dunkirk," Ralph replied. "She carried fourteen guns, mostly eighteen-pounders,
and a thirty-two-pounder on a pivot. She had eighty hands at first, but eight of them went
away in the prize."

"Do you know whether she has gone off straight for France or whether she is going to remain here?"

"Prom what I gathered from the men, sir, I believe the other two privateers are going straight
home. They loaded up from the storehouses, taking, of course, the most valuable stuff. There
was a great deal of copper, but what the rest was I do not know. Our brig was loaded up too,
but I believe her intention was to transfer her cargo into the first prize she took and send
it to France. I do not know whether she was going to cruise about here for a time, but I should
rather think that now that her consorts have gone and this place been discovered she will not
stay here, for she never intended to cruise in these waters long. I know that her destination
was the Indian Ocean, and she intended to capture Indiamen on their way out or home."

"In that case our expedition has been more satisfactory than I expected," the captain said.
"We shall have discovered and destroyed their depot here, captured anyhow some valuable stuff,
and caused the two privateers that we have been hunting for so long to leave the islands, to
say nothing of this brig of yours, of which we had not heard. Well, Mr. Wylde, what is your
report?"

"It will take a long time to go through the whole sir, but I should say that we have taken
a most valuable prize. Part of the goods consist of produce of these parts--puncheons of rum
and hogsheads of sugar in any number. Then I see they have left a good many tons of copper
behind them; overlooked them, I suppose, in the hurry of loading. A considerable portion of
the stores consist of home produce--cottons, cloths, silks, furniture, musical instruments,
mirrors, and, in fact, goods of all kinds."

"That is most satisfactory, Mr. Wylde, and we sha'n't have had our trouble for nothing. Ah!
here come the other boats."

As he spoke the pinnaces, long-boats, and cutters of the two ships of war dashed into the harbor,
and in a minute or two reached the landing-place.

"So they gave you the slip as well as me, Chambers?" Captain Wilson said.

"Confound them, yes. I was within about four miles of them at sunset, but they both gave me
the slip in the dark."

"Mine fairly outsailed me," Captain Wilson said. "I am afraid we have made rather a mess of
the affair; though we acted for the best, and I don't see how we could have done otherwise.
However. I have learned that the brig and the schooner we have been chasing so long have made
straight for France, so that we shall have no more trouble with them. The other brig, which
only arrived two days before we chased the others in here, has, it is believed, also gone off.
So we shan't have done so badly; for we can report that we have found out and destroyed their
nest here, and I fancy from what my lieutenant says we have made a very valuable capture, enough
to give us all a round sum in prize-money."

"That will be some consolation," the other laughed; "but I would give my share of it if I could
but have come up with and engaged those rascally craft I have been hunting all over the islands
for these last two years. Whom have we got here--two prisoners?"

"Well, I hardly know whether they can be called prisoners. One is an English lad who was in
a boat they run down in the channel, and who, I dare say, they were glad to get rid of. It
seems that he is a gentleman's son, and his story is clear enough. The other belongs to the
brig I chased, which it seems only arrived here two days ago. The young fellow says that he
has been particularly kind to him, and has begged me to regard him in the light of a castaway
sailor, seeing that he was found here unarmed and away from his ship. I think there is something
in his plea; and as there is no credit or glory to be obtained from handing over one prisoner,
I consider that under the circumstances we shall be justified in letting him go ashore quietly
and in saying nothing about it. At one time the man was a prisoner of war in England and has
picked up our language, so I dare say he will be able to manage to find his way home without
difficulty."

"What are you thinking of doing with all this stuff?" Captain Chambers asked, pointing to the
storehouses.

"I think we had better take it away with us. I don't like turning the Alert into a storeship;
but it would be better to do that than to have the expense of chartering two or three ships
to come here to fetch it away. Beside, if I did that, you would have to stop here until it
is all carried away, and to burn the storehouses afterward."

"Then by all means let us load up," Captain Chambers said. "I certainly have no wish to be
kept here for six weeks or a couple of months. I will go out and bring the Seagull in at once."

"The sooner the better, Chambers. I will set a couple of boats at work at once to take soundings
here and in the channel. If I can get the Alert in I will; it would save a lot of trouble and
time."

It was found that the channel and the harbor inside contained an abundance of water for the
frigate. The width between the rocks was, however, only just sufficient to let her through;
and, therefore, while the schooner sailed boldly in, the frigate was towed in by her boats.
The next morning the work of shipping the contents of the storehouses commenced, but so large
was the quantity of goods stored up that it took six days of hard work before all was safely
on board. The sailors, however, did not grudge the trouble, for they knew that every box and
bale meant so much prize-money.

"I hope we shall meet nothing we ought to chase on our way to Port Royal," Captain Wilson said,
looking with some disgust at the two vessels. "It has brought the Alert nearly two feet lower
in the water; while as to the Seagull she is laden down like a collier."

"Yes, her wings are clipped for the present," Captain Chambers replied. "Of course those rascals
carried off the pick of their booty with them; but we may be well content with what they left
behind. It will be the best haul that we have made for some years. As a rule, the most we have
to hope for is the money fetched by the sale of any privateer we may catch, and they generally
go for next to nothing. I retract what I said--that I would give my share of the prize-money
to come up with the privateers. I certainly never calculated on such a haul as this. I suppose
they intend to have gone on storing away their booty till the war came to an end, and then
to have chartered a dozen ships to carry it away."

Captain Wilson had introduced Ralph to the midshipmen, telling them he would be in their mess
till he reached port. He was soon at home among them, and his clothes were replaced by some
they lent him. Jacques made himself equally at home among the crew. Captain Wilson had intimated
to the first lieutenant that the man was not to be considered as a prisoner, but as a castaway,
picked up on the island; and from his cheery temper, his willingness to lend a hand and make
himself useful in any way, and his knowledge of their language, he was soon a favorite with them.

When all the goods were on board fire was applied to the storehouses and huts. The two vessels
were then towed out of the harbor, and hoisting sail made for Port Royal. The winds were light,
and it was six days before they entered the harbor. A signal was at once hoisted from the flagship
there for the captain to come on board.

"I have no doubt he is in a towering rage at our appearance," Captain Wilson said to the first
lieutenant; "but I fancy he will change his tone pretty quickly when he learns what we have
got on board. His share of the prize money will come to a pretty penny."

The next morning a number of lighters came alongside the ships, and the work of discharging
the cargo commenced. After breakfast Ralph and Jacques were rowed ashore.

"You will want some money to pay for your passage, young gentleman." Captain Wilson said to
Ralph before leaving the ship. "I will authorize you to tell an agent that I will be security
for the payment of your passage-money."

"I am very much obliged to you, sir," Ralph replied; "but I shall work my way home if I can.
I have learned to be pretty handy on board the privateer, and I would as lief be working forward
as dawdling about aft all the way home. Beside, I don't want to inconvenience my mother by
her being called upon suddenly to pay thirty or forty pounds directly I get home. I have caused
her trouble enough as it is."

"That's, right, my lad," the captain said. "I like your spirit. Have you money enough to pay
for your hotel expenses while you are waiting for a ship?"

"Yes, thank you, sir. The French captain said I had fairly earned wages, and gave me ten napoleons
when he started."

"He must have been a good sort of fellow," the captain said; "though I wish we had caught him
for all that. Well, good-by, and a pleasant voyage home."

Ralph put up at a quiet boarding-house, kept by a Mulatto woman. He and Jacques got a fresh
rig-out of clothes at once, and went down to the port to inquire about ships. Ralph was greatly
amused at the aspect of the streets crowded with chattering negroes and negresses, in gaudy
colors. The outlay of a few pence purchased an almost unlimited supply of fruit, and Ralph
and his companion sat down on a log of wood by the wharves and enjoyed a feast of pine apples,
bananas, and custard apples. Then they set about their work. In an hour both were suited. Jacques
Clery shipped as a foremast hand on board an American trading schooner, which was about to
return to New York; while Ralph obtained a berth before the mast in a fine bark that would
sail for England in a few days.

Next morning they said good-by to each other, for Jacques had to go on board after breakfast.
They made many promises to see each other again when the war came to an end.

"I shall never forget your kindness, Jacques; and if I am still at Dover when peace is proclaimed
I will run over to Dunkirk by the very first vessel that sails."

"As for the kindness, it is nothing," Jacques replied; "and beside that, you saved my life
from that snake. I dream sometimes of the beast still. And it was really owing to you that
I am here now, and that I shall get a round sum coming to me when I return home. If it hadn't
been for you I should not have been chosen to stop behind and get three shares instead of one
of the prize money. And in the next place it is your doing that I am free to start at once,
and to make my way back as soon as I can, instead of spending four or five years, it may be,
in an English prison. Why, my Louise will be ready to jump for joy when she sees me arrive,
instead of having to wait another two years for me, with the chance of my never coming back
at all; and she will hardly believe me when I tell her that I shall be able to afford to buy
that fishing boat and set up in a house of our own at once; and she will be most surprised
of all when I tell her that it is all owing to an English boy I fished on board on a dark night
in the channel."

"Well, Jacques, we won't dispute as to which owes the other most. Anyhow, except for my mother,
I am not sorry I have made the trip in the Belle Maire. I have seen a lot of life, and have
had a rare adventure; and I have learned so much of sailor's work, that if I am ever driven
to it I can work my way anywhere before the mast in future."

Ralph went on board his own ship as soon as he had seen Jacques off, and was soon hard at work
assisting to hoist on board hogsheads of sugar and other produce. He was startled by the sound
of a heavy gun. It was answered presently by all the ships of war in the harbor and by the
forts on shore, and for five minutes the heavy cannonade continued. The captain, who had been
on shore, crossed the gangway on to the ship as the crew were gazing in surprise at the cannonade,
exchanging guesses as to its cause.

"I have great news, lads," he said. "Peace is proclaimed, and Napoleon has surrendered, and
is to be shut up in the Isle of Elba in the Mediterranean. No more fear of privateers or French
prisons."

The crew burst into a hearty cheer. This was indeed surprising news. It was known that Wellington
was gradually driving back the French marshals in the south of France, and that the allies
were marching toward Paris. But Napoleon had been so long regarded as invincible, that no one
had really believed that his downfall was imminent.

Four days later the cargo was all on board, and the Fanny sailed for England. The voyage was
accomplished without adventure. As soon as the vessel entered dock and the crew were discharged
Ralph landed, and having purchased a suit of landsman clothes, presented his kit to a lad of
about his own age, who had been his special chum on board the Fanny, and then made his way
to the inn from which the coaches for Dover started. Having secured a place for next day, dined,
and ordered a bed, he passed the evening strolling about the streets of London, and next morning
at six o'clock took his place on the coach.

"Going back from school, I suppose, young gentleman?" a military-looking man seated next to
him on the coach remarked as soon as they had left the streets behind them, and were rattling
along the Old Kent Road.

"No, I am not going home from school," Ralph said with a smile. "At least not from the sort
of school you mean; though I have been learning a good deal too. I arrived yesterday from the
West Indies."

"Indeed!" the gentleman said, scrutinizing him closely. "I see you look sunburned and weather-beaten
now that I look at you; but somehow I should not have put you down as a sailor."

"Well, I am not exactly a sailor; though I may say I have worked as one before the mast both
out and home. That was my first experience; and I suppose one takes longer than that to get
the regular nautical manner."

"Before the mast, were you? Then I suppose you have been getting into some scrape at home,
young sir, and run away; for, from your appearance, you would hardly have been before the mast
otherwise. Boys never know what is good for them. But I suppose after your experience you will
be inclined to put up with any disagreeables you may have at home rather than try running away
again?"

"You are mistaken!" Ralph said with a laugh. "I did not run away. I was run away with!"

"Kidnapped!" the gentleman said in surprise. "I know that merchantmen have often difficulty
in getting hands owing to the need of men for the navy, but I did not know that they had taken
to press-gangs on their own account."

"No, I don't know that they have come to that," Ralph replied. "The fact is, sir, I was out
fishing a few miles off Dover, when the smack I was in was run down in the dark by a French
privateer. I was hauled on board, and as she was bound for the West Indies I had to make the
voyage whether I liked it or not."

"How long ago is it that you were run down?"

"About five months," Ralph replied.

"Why, you are not the son of Mrs. Conway of Dover, are you?"

"Yes, I am, sir. Do you know her, and can you tell me how she is?" Ralph asked eagerly.

"I believe that she is well, although of course she must have suffered very greatly at your
disappearance. I haven't the pleasure of knowing her personally, but several friends of mine
are acquainted with her. I heard the matter talked about at the time the boat was missing.
Some portions of her were picked up by other fishing boats, and by the shattered state of some
of the planks they said that she had been run down; beside, there had been no wind about the
time she disappeared, so that there was little doubt some vessel or other had cut her down.
I happened to hear of it from Colonel Bryant, who is a friend of your mother."

"Yes, I know him," Ralph put in.

"I have heard Colonel Bryant say that she has not altogether abandoned hope, and still clings
to the idea that you may have been run down by some outward-bound ship and that you had been
saved and carried away, and that she declares that she shall not give up all hope until ample
time has elapsed for a ship to make the voyage to India and return."

"I am very glad of that," Ralph said. "It has been a great trouble to me that she would be
thinking all this time that I was dead. I should not have minded having been carried away so
much if I had had a chance of writing to her to tell her about it; but I never did have a chance,
for I came home by the very first ship that left Port Royal after I arrived there."

"But how did you get away from the French privateer--was she captured?"

"Well, it is rather a long story, sir," Ralph said modestly.

"All the better," the gentleman replied. "We have got fourteen hours journey before us, and
your story will help pass the time; so don't try to cut it short, but let me have it in full."
Ralph thereupon told the story, which lasted until the coach reached Tunbridge, where it stopped
for the passengers to dine.

"Well, that is an adventure worth going through," the officer, who had already mentioned that
his name was Major Barlow, said; "and it was well for you, lad, that you possessed good spirits
and courage. A man who is cheerful and willing under difficulties will always make his way
in the world, while one who repines and kicks against his fate only makes it harder for him.
I have no doubt that if, instead of taking matters coolly when you found yourself on board
the privateer you had fretted and grumbled, you would have been made a drudge and kicked and
cuffed by everyone on board. You would not have had a chance of landing at that island or of
being chosen to make the signal when they went away, and you would now be leading the life
of a dog on board that brig. Cheerful and willing are two of the great watchwords of success
in life, and certainly you have found it so."

It was eight o'clock when the coach rattled up the streets of Dover. Major Barlow had already
offered Ralph to take him to Colonel Bryant's quarters, and to ask the colonel to go with him
to call on Mrs. Conway and prepare her for Ralph's coming.

CHAPTER VII.

A COMMISSION.

Colonel Bryant was just rising from dinner at the mess when Major Barlow and Ralph arrived
at the barracks, and after congratulating the lad on his return he willingly agreed to accompany
them to Mrs. Conway. A quarter of an hour's walk took them to her house. Ralph remained outside
when the two officers entered. Colonel Bryant lost no time in opening the subject.

"I have brought my friend Major Barlow to introduce to you, Mrs. Conway, because he has happened
to hear some news that may, I think, bear upon the subject that you have most at heart."

"Ralph!" Mrs. Conway exclaimed, clasping her hands.

"We think it may refer to your son, Mrs. Conway," Major Barlow said. "I have just returned
from town, and happened to hear that a vessel had been spoken with that reported having picked
up a lad from a smack run down in the channel some five months ago, which corresponds pretty
well, I think, with the time your son was missing."

"Just the time," Mrs. Conway said. "Did they not say the name?"

"Well, yes. The name, as far as I heard it, for as I had not the pleasure of knowing you I
was not of course so interested in the matter, was the same as yours."

"I think that there is no doubt about it, Mrs. Conway," Colonel Bryant said kindly. "I consider
you may quite set your mind at ease, for I have no doubt whatever it is your son who has been
picked up." Mrs. Conway was so much overcome that she sank into a chair and sat for a short
time with her face in her hand, crying happy tears and thanking God for his mercy. Then with
a great effort she aroused herself.

"You will excuse my emotion, gentlemen, and I am sure you can understand my feelings. I am
thankful indeed for the news you have brought me. I have never ceased for a moment to hope
that my boy would be restored to me; but the knowledge that it is so, and that God has spared
him to me, is for the moment overpowering. And where was the ship met with, Major Barlow, and
where was she bound for? Did her had once work that her had honor, to separation, being repair

Captain O'Connor was evidently a favorite in the regiment, for his arrival was heartily greeted.
He at once introduced the two lads to their future comrades, took them to the colonel, looked
after their quarters, and made them at home. In their absence he spoke warmly in favor of Ralph.
"You will find Conway a first-rate young fellow. He has seen something of the world, has been
carried out to the West Indies by a French privateersman, and has gone through a lot of adventures.
He is a bright, pleasant, good-tempered fellow. The other is as green as grass, and has never
been away from his mother's apron-string. However, I do not think you will find him a bad sort
of fellow when he has got rid of his rawness. Don't be too hard upon him, you boys. Remember
easy does it, and don't be pushing your jokes too far. He is not a fool and will come round
in time."

CHAPTER VIII.

STARTLING NEWS.

Three weeks after Ralph's departure to join his regiment Mrs. Conway received a letter which
gave her a great shook. It was from Mrs. Withers, and was as follows:

    "MY DEAR MRS. CONWAY: I have very sad news to tell you. An event
    has happened which will, I know, be as afflicting to you as it has
    been to us. Our dear friend Mr. Penfold, who but three weeks ago
    was so bright and happy with us in London, has passed away
    suddenly. Up to the day before yesterday he seemed in his usual
    health; but yesterday morning he did not appear at breakfast, and
    the servant on going up to his room, found him sitting in a chair
    by his bedside dead. The bed had not been slept in, and it appears
    as if before commencing to undress he had been seized with a
    sudden faintness and had sunk into the chair and died without
    being able to summon assistance.

    "His death is a terrible shock to us, as it will be to you. My
    husband and myself have long been aware that our dear friend
    suffered from disease of the heart, and that the doctor he
    consulted in London had told him that his death might take place
    at any moment. At the same time, he had been so bright and
    cheerful in London, as indeed with us he was at all times, that
    his death comes almost with as great a surprise to us as if we had
    not known that he was in danger. Mr. Tallboys, the solicitor of
    Weymouth who managed Mr. Penfold's affairs, called here last
    night. The funeral is to take place on Thursday, and had Ralph
    been in England he said that he should have written to him to come
    down to it, which he could have done in time had he started
    immediately he received the letter announcing the event; but as he
    is over in Ireland, of course nothing can be done.

    "He said that had Ralph come he should have suggested that you
    also should be present at the reading of the will, but that as
    matters stand he did not think there was any occasion to trouble
    you. I should tell you that Mr. Tallboys appeared a good deal
    worried, and one of his reasons for calling was to ask my husband
    whether he knew where Mr. Penfold was in the habit of keeping his
    papers. It seems that upon the day after his return from London
    Mr. Penfold called upon him and took away his will, saying that he
    wanted to look over it, as he had two or three slight alterations
    that he wanted to make, and he would bring it back in the course
    of a day or two and get him to make the changes required. From
    that time Mr. Penfold had not been in Weymouth, and, indeed, had
    scarcely left the house except to come down here; for, as he said
    to my husband, he did not feel quite himself, and supposed it was
    a reaction after his late dissipations.

    "Mr. Tallboys, who is one of the executors named in the will, had
    searched for it in the afternoon among Mr. Penfold's papers; but
    found that it and several other documents--leases and so on--of
    importance were all missing. He had asked Miss Penfold if she knew
    where her brother was in the habit of keeping important papers;
    but she replied shortly that she knew nothing whatever of her
    brother's business matters. He had, therefore, driven over to ask
    my husband, knowing how intimate he had been with poor Herbert. He
    knew, it seems, that Mr. Penfold had some secure place for such
    papers, because he had one day spoken to him upon the subject,
    saying it would be more prudent for him to leave the leases in the
    strong-box in his office at Weymouth. But Herbert replied that
    they were stowed away in a far safer place, and that he had not
    the least fear in the world of their being stolen.

    "Now, this is just what my husband knew also. Once when they were
    chatting together Herbert mentioned that the house like many other
    old mansions contained a secret chamber. He said: 'I can't tell
    you where it is, Withers; for although it is never likely to be
    used again, the knowledge of this hiding-place has been passed
    down from generation to generation as a family secret. I gave a
    solemn promise never to reveal it when I was first informed of its
    existence; and although in these days there is no occasion to hide
    priests or conspirators, I do not consider myself released from
    the promise I gave. Possibly some day the hiding-place may prove
    of value again. There may be a price set on the head of a Penfold,
    who can tell? Anyhow it is likely to remain a secret as long as
    the old house stands; and in the meantime I find it a useful place
    for keeping things that I do not want lying about.' Mr. Tallboys
    appeared very vexed at hearing what my husband said.

    "'It is very strange.' he said, 'that sensible men will do such
    foolish things. It is probable enough that Herbert Penfold has
    placed this will in the hiding-place you speak of, and in that
    case I foresee that we shall have no end of trouble. I know you
    are both aware of the nature of Mr. Penfold's will, and you may be
    sure that if those sisters of his also know of it--whether they do
    or not I can't say--they will bitterly resent it. I know enough of
    the family history to know that. It was evident by Miss Penfold's
    answer to me to-day that either she does not know the secret of
    this hiding-place--which is of course possible--or that if she
    does know she does not mean to say. I should imagine myself that
    she does know.

    "'Had Herbert Penfold been of age when his father died it is
    likely enough that he only as head of the family would have been
    told by his father of its existence; but you see he was but a lad
    at that time, while the Miss Penfolds were women, and were
    therefore probably informed of the secret. It is very awkward,
    extremely awkward. Of course the will may turn up between this and
    the funeral; but if not I hardly know what steps had best be
    taken. If those Penfold women have made up their minds that this
    will shall not see the light they are likely to carry it through
    to the end. My husband quite agreed with Mr. Tallboys about that,
    and so do I. I have never been able to abide them, though, as my
    husband says, they are good women in many respects, and always
    ready to help in parish matters. Still I can't abide them, nor I
    am sure have you any reason to do so; for when I and my husband
    first came here we learned a good deal of the part they had played
    in a certain matter, and that of course set me altogether against
    them.

    "Of course, my dear Mrs. Conway, I do not wish to alarm you about
    the will; still you ought to know how things stand, and my husband
    this morning asked me to tell you all there was to tell. I hope in
    a few days to be able to write and give you better news. Things
    may not be as they fear."

Mrs. Conway sat for a long time with this letter before her. She had not read it straight through,
but after glancing at the first few lines that told of the death of Herbert Penfold she had
laid it aside, and it was a long time before she took it up again. He had been the love of
her youth; and although he had seemingly gone for so many years out of her life, she knew that
when she had found how he had all this time watched over her and so delicately aided her, and
that for her sake he was going to make Ralph his heir, her old feeling had been revived. Not
that she had any thought that the past would ever return. His letters indeed had shown that
he regarded his life as approaching its end; but since the receipt of that letter she had always
thought of him with a tender affection as one who might have been her husband had not either
evil fate or malice stepped in to prevent it.

The fortnight they had spent in London had brought them very close together. He had assumed
the footing of a brother, but she had felt that pleasant and kind as he was to all the rest
of the party it was for her sake alone that this festivity had been arranged. They had had
but one talk together alone, and she had then said that she hoped the expressions he had used
in his letter to her with reference to his health were not altogether justified, for he seemed
so bright and well. He had shaken his head quietly and said:

"It is just as well that you should know, Mary. I have seen my physician since I came up to
town, and I don't think it will last much longer. A little time ago I did not wish it to last,
now I should be glad to go on until I can see my little scheme realized; but I am quite sure
that it is not to be. Anyhow I am ready to go when I am summoned, and am happy in the thought
that the few people I care for are all in a fair way to be happy. Don't cry, dear. I don't
want a single cloud to hang over our memories of this time. I am happier than I have ever been
in my life, and I want you and all of them to be very happy too. I have set my mind upon that,
and if I see a cloud on your face it will spoil it all."

Still in spite of this she had hoped the doctor might have taken too gloomy a view of the case,
and that Herbert Penfold's death might yet be a distant event.

And now it was all over. Herbert Penfold was dead. The heart that had beat so kindly for her
was silenced forever. It was then a long time before Mrs. Conway recovered sufficiently from
her emotion to take up the letter again. She did so with an air almost of indifference. She
had learned the news, and doubtless all this long epistle contained many details of comparatively
little interest. But as she read her air of languid grief gave way to an expression of keen
interest, and she skimmed through the last page or two with anxious haste. Then she reread
it more slowly and carefully, and then throwing it on the table stood up and walked up and
down the little room.

So these women, who had as she believed ruined her life and Herbert's, were now going to attack
her son and rob him of his rights. They should not do it if she could help it. Never! Mary
Vernon had been a high-spirited girl, and, although those who had only known her through her
widowhood would have taken her for a gentle and quiet woman, whose thoughts were entirely wrapped
up in her boy, the old spirit was alive yet, as with head thrown back, and an angry flush on
her cheeks, she declared to herself that she would defend Ralph's rights to the last. How or
in what manner she did not ask; she only knew that those who would defraud him were her old
enemies.

Had it been otherwise the fact that they were Herbert's sisters would have softened her toward
them; now that fact only added to the hostility she bore them. They, his nearest relations
of blood, had ruined his life; now they would defeat his dying wishes. It should not be if
she could help it. She would fight against it to the last day of her life. There was of course
nothing to be done yet. Nothing until she heard again. Nothing until she knew that the discovery
of the will was given up as hopeless. Then it would be time for her to do something.

The thought barely occurred to her that the loss of this will might make material difference
in her own circumstances, and that the allowance Herbert Penfold had made her, and which he
had doubtless intended she should continue to receive, would cease. That was so secondary a
consideration that it at present gave her no trouble. It was of Ralph she thought. Of Ralph
and Herbert. Were the plans that the latter had made--the plans that had given happiness to
the last year of the life of him who had known so little happiness--to be shattered? This to
her mind was even more than the loss that Ralph would suffer.

"They may have destroyed the will," she said at last; "but if not I will find it, if it takes
me all my life to do so."

A week later two letters arrived. The one was from Mrs. Withers. The will had not been found.
Mr. Tallboys had searched in vain. Every cabinet and drawer in the house had been ransacked.
No signs whatever had been found of the will.

"Mr. Tallboys is perfectly convinced that it must be hidden in some altogether exceptional
place. The will was not a bulky document, and might have been stowed away in a comparatively
small hiding-place, such as a secret drawer in a cabinet; but the leases that are also missing
are bulky, and would take up so large a space that he is convinced that had a secret hiding-place
sufficiently large to hold them existed in any of the articles of furniture he has searched
he should have discovered it.

"Of course, my dear Mrs. Conway, we feel this matter personally, as our Mabel was as you know
made joint-heiress with your Ralph of Herbert's property. We cannot but feel, however, that
the loss is greater in your case than in ours. Mabel was never informed of Herbert's intentions
toward her, and although we should of course have been glad to know that our child had such
brilliant prospects, the loss of them will not we may hope in any way affect her happiness.
In the case of your son it is different, and his prospects in life will of course be seriously
affected by the loss, and my husband begs me to express to you his very deep regret at this.

"We have talked over your letter together, and while fully sharing your indignation at the
conduct of the Misses Penfold, hardly see that anything can be done to discover the will. However,
should you be able to point out any manner in which a search for it can be carried on, we shall
be happy to do what we can to aid in the matter, as it is clearly our duty to endeavor to obtain
for Mabel the fortune Herbert Penfold willed to her. Mr. Tallboys tells us that it is clear
the Misses Penfold have quite determined upon their line of conduct. Whatever they may know
they have declined altogether to aid him in his search for the will, Miss Penfold saying, in
reply to his request that they would do so, that they had every reason to believe from what
their brother had let fall that the will was an unjust and iniquitous one; that if Providence
intended it should see the light it would see it; but they at least would do nothing in the matter.

"He asked them plainly if they were aware of the existence of any place in which it was likely
that their brother had placed it. To this Miss Penfold, who is, as she has always been, the
spokesman of the two sisters, said shortly, that she had never seen the will, that she didn't
want to see it, and that she did not know where her brother had placed it; indeed, for aught
she knew, he might have torn it up. As to hiding-places, she knew of no hiding-place whose
existence she could, in accordance with the dictates of her conscience divulge. So that is
where we are at present, Mrs. Conway. I believe that Mr. Tallboys is going to try and get a
copy of the will that he has in his possession admitted under the circumstances as proof of
Herbert Penfold's intentions. But he owned to us that he thought it was very doubtful whether
he should be able to do so, especially as Herbert had stated to him that he intended to make
alterations; and it would be quite possible that a court might take the view that in the first
place the alterations might have been so extensive as to affect the whole purport of the will,
and in the second place that he might have come to the conclusion that it would be easier to
make the whole will afresh, and so had destroyed the one he had by him."

Mrs. Conway laid down the letter, and after thinking for a time opened the other, which was
in a handwriting unknown to her. It began:

    "DEAR MADAM.: Mrs. Withers tells me that she has informed you of
    the singular disappearance of the will of my late client, Mr.
    Herbert Penfold. I beg to inform you that we shall not let this
    matter rest, but shall apply to the court to allow the copy of
    the will to be put in for probate; if that is refused, for
    authorization to make a closer search of the Hall than we have
    hitherto been able to do, supporting our demand with affidavits
    made by the Rev. Mr. Withers and ourselves of our knowledge that,
    the late Mr. Penfold was accustomed to keep documents in some
    secret receptacle. In the second place, we are glad to inform you
    that the annual sum paid by us into the Kentish bank to your
    credit will not be affected by the loss of the will; for at the
    time when that payment first commenced, Mr. Penfold signed a deed
    making this payment a first charge on the rents of two of his
    farms during your lifetime. This assignment was of a binding
    character, and of course continues to hold good. We shall consider
    it our duty to acquaint you from time to time with the course of
    proceedings in the matter of the late Mr. Penfold's will."

Little as Mrs. Conway had thought of herself from the time when she first heard that the will
was missing, the news that her income would remain unchanged delighted her. She had formed
no plans for herself, but had vaguely contemplated the necessity of giving up her house as
soon as it was decided that the will could not be found, selling her furniture, and for the
present taking a small lodging. She was glad that there would be no occasion for this; but
very much more glad that she should be able now to make Ralph an allowance of seventy or eighty
pounds a year, which would make all the difference between his living comfortably and being
obliged to pinch himself in every way to subsist upon his pay. It would also enable her to
carry out without difficulty any plans she might determine upon.

Upon the receipt of the letter announcing Mr. Penfold's death, she had written to Ralph telling
him of it, but saying nothing about Mr. Tallboys' visit to the Withers, or his report that
he was unable to find the will. She now wrote to him relating the whole circumstances. He had
not previously known Mr. Penfold's intention to make him his heir, being only told that he
intended to push his way in life, and had considered that the promise was carried out by his
obtaining him a commission and arranging some allowance. His mother was glad of this now.

"Of course the loss of Mr. Penfold's will, my boy, will make a difference to you, as there
can be no doubt that he had made some provisions in it for the regular payment of the allowance
he had so kindly promised you. This, unless the will is found, you will of course lose. Having
been a soldier's daughter, I know that to live comfortably in the army it is necessary to have
something beyond your pay; but fortunately I can assist you a little. I have now one less to
feed and clothe, and no schooling expenses; and I have been calculating things up, and find
that I can allow you seventy-five pounds a year without making any difference in the manner
of my living. You will be able to see that for yourself. You need, therefore, feel no hesitation
in accepting this allowance."

"It is not a large one; but I know it will make a very great difference in your comfort, and
it will be a great pleasure to me to know that you will be able to enter into what amusements
are going on and not to look at every penny. It makes all the difference in the world whether
one has four and sixpence or nine shillings a day to live upon. You wrote and told me of the
handsome present Mr. Penfold made you at parting. This, my boy, I should keep if I were you
as a reserve, only to be touched in case of unexpected difficulties or needs. No one can ever
say when such needs may occur. I hope you will not pain me by writing to say you don't want
this allowance, because nothing you can say will alter my determination to pay that allowance
regularly every quarter into your agent's hands; and it will be, of course, very much more
pleasant to me to know that it is as much a pleasure to you to be helped by me as it is to
me to help you, I have heard several times from Mrs. Withers; they are all well, and she asked
me to send their remembrances to you when I write. I do not give up all hope that the will
may be found one of these days, but it is just as well that we should not build in the slightest
upon it."

Ralph's reply came in due time, that is in about a fortnight afterward; for Mrs. Conway's letter
had first to go by coach to London, and then a two days' journey by the mail to Liverpool,
then by the sailing packet across to Dublin, and then down to Cork by coach. He had already
written expressing his regret at the news of Mr. Penfold's death.

"My dear mother," he began. "It is awfully good of you to talk about making an allowance to
me. After what you say, of course I cannot think of refusing it, though I would do so if I
thought the payment would in the slightest way inconvenience you. But as you say that now I
am away it will make something like that sum difference in your expenses, I must of course
let you do as you like, and can only thank you very heartily for it. But I could really have
got on very well without it. I fancy that a good many men in the regiment have nothing but
their pay, and as they manage very well there is no reason I could not manage too.

"Of course in war times things are not kept up so expensively as they were before, and lots
of men get commissions who would not have done so when the army was only half its present size,
and was considered as a gentlemanly profession instead of a real fighting machine. However,
as you say, it is a great deal more pleasant having nine shilling a day to live on instead
of four and sixpence.

"I am getting on capitally here. Of course there is a lot of drill, and it is as much as I
can do not to laugh sometimes, the sergeant, who is a fierce little man, gets into such wild
rages over our blunders.

"I say our blunders, for of course Stapleton and I are drilled with the recruits. However,
I think that in another week I shall be over that, and shall then begin to learn my work as
an officer. They are a jolly set of fellows here, always up to some fun or other. I always
thought when fellows got to be men they were rather serious, but it seems to me that there
is ever so much more fun here among them than there was at school. Of course newcomers get
worried a little just as they do at school. I got off very well; because, you see, what with
school and the privateer I have learned to take things good temperedly, and when fellows see
that you are as ready for fun as they are they soon give up bothering you.

"Stapleton has had a lot more trouble; because, you see, he will look at things seriously.
I think he is getting a little better now; but he used to get quite mad at first, and of course
that made fellows ever so much worse. He would find his door screwed up when he went back after
mess; and as soon as they found that he was awfully particular about his boots, they filled
them all full of water one night. Then some one got a ladder and threw a lot of crackers into
his bedroom in the middle of the night, and Stapleton came rushing down in his night-shirt
with his sword drawn, swearing he would kill somebody.

"Of course I have done all I can to get them to leave him alone, for he is really a good fellow,
and explained to them that he had never been to school, or had a chance of learning to keep
his temper. But he is getting on now, and will, I think, soon be left alone. This has been
an awfully long letter, and there is only just enough candle left for me to get into bed by.
Anyhow mother, I am not a bit upset about losing Mr. Penfold's allowance; so don't you worry
yourself at all about that."

Some weeks passed on. Mr. Tallboys wrote that he had failed to induce the court to accept the
copy of the will, the admission he was forced to make that Mr. Penfold had intended to make
an alteration in it being fatal. He had, however, obtained an order authorizing him thoroughly
to search the house, and to take down any wainscotting, and to pull up any floors that might
appear likely to conceal a hiding-place. A fortnight later he wrote again to announce his failure.

"The Miss Penfolds," he said, "were so indignant that they left the house altogether, and you
may believe that we ransacked it from top to bottom. I had four carpenters and two masons with
me, and I think we tapped every square foot of wall in the house, took down the wainscotting
wherever there was the slightest hollow sound, lifted lots of the flooring, and even wrenched
up several of the hearthstones, but could find nothing whatever, except that there was a staircase
leading from behind the wainscotting in Mr. Penfold's room to a door covered with ivy, and
concealed from view by bushes to the left of the house; but the ivy had evidently been undisturbed
for fifty years or so, this passage, even if known to Mr. Penfold, had certainly not been used
in his time.

"I truly regret, my dear madam, that the search should have been so unsuccessful, and can only
say, that all that could be done has been done. That the will is concealed somewhere I have
not a shadow of doubt, unless, of course, it has been torn up before this. As to that I give
no opinion; and, indeed, as it is a matter in which women are concerned, your judgment as to
the probabilities is much more likely to be correct than mine. As I expected, my business connection
with the family has come to an end. The Miss Penfolds have appointed another agent, who has
written to me requesting me to hand over all papers connected with the property. This, of course,
I shall do. I need hardly say that in no case could I have consented to act for those whom
I consider to be unlawful possessors of the property. In conclusion, I can only say that my
services will at all times be at your disposal."

Mrs. Conway was scarcely disappointed at the receipt of this letter, for she had quite made
up her mind that the will would not be found. These women had clearly made up their minds to
deprive Ralph and Mabel of their rights, and unless they had felt perfectly satisfied that
no search would discover the hiding-place of the will, they would not improbably have taken
it, and either destroyed it or concealed it in some fresh place where the searchers would never
be likely to look for it. She did not think it likely, therefore, that the hiding-place would
be discovered, and she felt assured that were it discovered it would be found empty.

"Very well," she said, in a quiet, determined voice, as she laid down the letter. "Mr. Tallboys
has failed. Now, I shall take up the matter. I dare say you think that you have won, Miss Penfold;
that you are now mistress beyond dispute of Herbert's property. You will see the battle has
only just begun. It will last, I can tell you, all your lives or mine."

A week later an altogether unexpected event took place. When Mr. and Mrs. Withers were at breakfast
a letter arrived from Mr. Littleton, now solicitor to the Miss Penfolds. Upon opening it it
was found to contain an offer upon the part of the Miss Penfolds to settle the sum of a hundred
a year for life upon Mabel, upon the condition only that the allowance would be stopped upon
her marriage, unless that marriage received the approval, in writing, of the Miss Penfolds.
The letter was addressed to Mr. Withers, and after reading it through he passed it to his wife
without a word. She was too surprised to say anything for a moment, especially as Mabel was
in the room, and she laid the letter beside her until breakfast was over and Mabel had gone out.

"Well, James, what do you think of it?" she asked.

"What do you think of it yourself?" he replied.

Mrs. Withers hesitated, and then said: "Well, James, it is a sort of thing that requires so
much thinking about that I have scarcely had time to turn it over in my mind yet, especially
with Mabel there eating her breakfast opposite, and having no idea that this letter contained
anything of such importance to her. I would really rather hear what you think about it." Mr.
Withers remained silent, and she went on: "Of course it would be a very nice thing for Mabel
to have such a provision for life."

A slight smile passed across Mr. Withers' face, and his wife saw that that was not at all the
way in which he looked at it.

"That is just like you men, James," she said a little pettishly. "You ask us what we think
about things when you have perfectly made up your minds what you mean to do, whether we agree
with you or not."

"I don't think that's often the case with us. Still I did want to see whether the matter would
have struck you at once in the same light in which I see it, and I perceive that it has not."

"Well, James, let me hear your view of the matter. I dare say I shall agree with you when you
tell me what it is."

"Well, then, Amy," Mr. Withers said seriously, "it appears to me that we cannot accept this
offer for Mabel."

Mrs. Withers looked a little blank. The living was not a rich one, and assured as they had
been by Mr. Penfold that he intended to provide for Mabel, they had not endeavored to lay by
anything for her, and had freely dispensed their surplus income among the sick and needy of
the parish. The disappearance of the will had disappointed their hopes, and raised many anxious
thoughts in Mrs. Withers' mind respecting Mabel's future, and the offer contained in the letter
had therefore filled her with pleasure. But she greatly valued her husband's judgment, and
therefore only replied:

"Why, dear?"

"Well, you see, wife, we are both thoroughly agreed that these ladies are depriving Mabel of
the fortune Herbert Penfold left her. They are concealing or have destroyed his will, and are
at present in what we may call fraudulent possession of his property. Now, I do not think that
under these circumstances we can accept a favor at their hands. To do so would be practically
to acquiesce in what we consider the robbery of our child, and the acceptance would of course
involve a renewal of friendly relations with them; a thing which, believing as we do that they
are acting wickedly would be distasteful in the extreme, not to say impossible."

"Of course you are right, dear," Mrs. Withers said, rising from her seat and going over and
kissing her husband tenderly. "I had not thought of it in that light at all. In fact I had
hardly thought about it at all, except that it would be nice to see Mabel provided for."

"It would be nice, my dear. But we surely need not be anxious about her. We may hope that she
will make a happy marriage. We may hope too that we may be spared long enough to make some
provision for her, for, of course, we must now curtail our expenses and lay by as much as we
can for her. Lastly, dear, we need not be anxious; because we trust that God will provide for
her should we not be enabled to do so. But even were I sure that we should both be taken together,
I would rather leave her in His hands than accept money wrongfully obtained and condone an
abominable action. There is, too, another point from which the matter should be looked at.
You see this curious condition that they propose, that the annuity shall be forfeited unless
she marry with their sanction. Why should they propose such a condition?"

"I am sure I don't know, James; for of course, we should never give our sanction to her marriage
unless we approved of her choice, and surely the Miss Penfolds would not disapprove of a choice
that we approved of?"

"Well, they might, my dear. You know how bitterly they disliked Ralph Conway, and how they
resented his being at the Hall. It is quite possible they may have had some idea of Herbert's
views about him and Mabel, and are determined that he shall not benefit through Mabel by one
penny of their brother's property; and this clause is specially designed so that in case the
two young people ever should come together they may be able if not to stop it--at any rate
to stop the annuity. That is the only interpretation I can give to this condition."

"Very likely that is so James. Really these women seem to get more detestable every day."

Mr. Withers smiled at his wife's vehemence. "There is still another reason why we cannot take
the money. Ralph Conway has been as much defrauded as Mabel, and his mother, as you see by
her letters, is determined not to sit down quietly under the wrong. What she means to do I
have not the slightest idea, nor do I think that there is the most remote probability she will
ever succeed in finding the will. Tallboys appears to have made a most thorough search of the
house, and do what she will she cannot have any opportunity of searching as he has done. Still
she clearly has something on her mind. She intends to make some attempt or other to discover
the will, which, if found, will benefit Mabel equally with her son. Therefore we cannot but
regard her as our friend and ally. Now, were we to accept the money for Mabel we should in
fact be acquiescing, not only in the wrong done to her but in that done to Ralph. We should,
in fact, be going over to the enemy. We could not take their money and even tacitly connive
in her efforts to find the will."

"I agree with you entirely, James. It would be impossible; only I do wish you had said all
this before letting me be so foolish as to say that I thought we ought to take it."

"You didn't say so, dear," Mr. Withers said smiling. "You only gave expression to the first
natural thought of a mother that it would be a nice thing for Mabel. You had given the matter
no further consideration than that, and I was quite sure that as soon as you thought the matter
over you would see it in the same light that I do. But I think that before we send off our
reply we should put the matter before Mabel herself. I have no doubt whatever what her answer
will be, but at the same time she ought to know of the offer which has been made to her."

CHAPTER IX.

MR. TALLBOYS' VISITOR.

Mr. Withers was fully justified in his conviction that there need be no doubt as to the view
Mabel would take of the Miss Penfold's offer. The girl had hitherto been in entire ignorance
both as to the will being missing, and of the interest she had in it. She was now called in
from the garden, and was much surprised when her father told her to sit down, as he and her
mother wished to have a serious talk with her.

"Do you know, my little Mabel," he began, "that you have had a narrow escape of being an heiress?"

"An heiress, papa! Do you mean of having a lot of money?"

"Yes, of coming in some day to a fortune. Mr. Penfold some time ago confided to your mother
and me his intention of dividing his property equally between Ralph Conway and yourself."

"What! all the Penfold estates, papa, and the house and everything?"

"Yes, my dear. Everything, including the large sum of money that has accumulated during the
years Mr. Penfold has not been spending a third of his income."

"Then if he meant that, papa, how is it that I am not going to be an heiress?"

"Simply, my dear, because the will by which Mr. Penfold left the property to you and Ralph
is missing."

Mr. Withers then told the whole story of the loss of the will, the search that had been made
for it, and the strong grounds there were for believing in the existence of some secret place
in the Hall, and that this place of concealment was known to Mr. Penfold's sisters.

"But they surely could never be so wicked as that, papa. They have always seemed to like me--not
very much, you know, because they thought I wasn't quiet and ladylike enough. Still I don't
think they really disliked me."

"No, I think in their way they liked you, Mabel; and perhaps if Mr. Penfold had half left his
property to you, divided the other half between them the will would have been found. But they
certainly did not like Ralph Conway. They disliked him partly no doubt for himself, but principally
on account of a wrong which I believe they once did to his mother. Now, it is in human nature,
Mabel, that you may forgive a wrong done to you, but it is very hard to forgive a person you
have wronged. Anyhow, I am convinced that it was more to prevent Mrs. Conway's son from getting
this money than to get it themselves that they have concealed this will, or rather that they
refuse to point out its place of concealment."

"But it does seem hard, papa, that Mr. Penfold should have left everything to Ralph and me
and nothing to his sisters."

"The Miss Penfolds have a very comfortable income of their own, Mabel, and their brother might
very well have thought there was no occasion for them to have more; beside, although they lived
in his house, and indeed managed it and him, Mr. Penfold had, I know, strong reason to believe
that they had ruined his life. But this is a matter into which we need not go. Well, Mabel,
the Miss Penfolds have just given a proof that they do not dislike you. Now I will read you
this letter, because I think you ought to know it has been written, and I will then tell you
the reasons why your mother and I think that the offer cannot be accepted."

Mabel listened in silence until her father had finished the arguments he had used with his
wife, with the exception only of that relating to the Miss Penfolds' motives in putting in
the condition concerning Mabel's marriage. When he ceased speaking she exclaimed indignantly,
"Of course, papa, we could not take the money, not if it were ten times as much! Why, we could
not look Mrs. Conway and Ralph in the face again! Beside, how could we speak to people one
believes to have done such a wicked thing?"

"Very well, Mabel. I was quite sure that you would agree with us, but at the same time I thought
it was right before we refused the offer you should know that it was made. Whatever our sentiments
on the subject might be, we should not have been justified in refusing without your knowledge
an offer that might, from a worldly point of view, be your interest to accept."

"Why, papa," Mabel said, "I would rather go out and weed turnips or watch sheep, like some
of the girls in the village, than touch a penny of the Miss Penfolds' money."

A short time after this Mr. Tallboys' clerk brought a letter into his private office.

"A lady asked me to give you this, sir." The solicitor opened it. It contained only a card.

"Show the lady in. How are you, madam? I am glad to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance.
I suppose you are staying with Mr. Withers?"

"No, Mr. Tallboys, I am at the hotel here. I only arrived an hour since by the packet from Dover."

"Dear me. I am afraid you have had a very unpleasant voyage."

"It has not been pleasant," Mrs. Conway said quietly. "But I preferred it to the long journey
by coach up to London, and down here again. We were five days on the way, as the vessel put
in at so many ports. Still that was quite a minor question with me. Yes! oh, you keep you have

.
 We believe that the will is still there,
and we believe that if some one in the house were to make a thorough search it might be found.
It is right that it should be found, and that the property should go to those to whom Mr. Penfold
left it, and who are now being kept out of it by the Miss Penfolds. I am very much interested
in the matter, because it is my son who is being cheated out of his rights; and I have made
up my mind to find the will. Now, what I want to know is, do you think that one of the housemaids
would be willing to give up her place and introduce me as her successor, if I gave her twenty-five
pounds? That would be a nice little sum, you know, to begin housekeeping with."

Mrs. Conway saw at once by the expression of the young carpenter's face that she had secured
him as an ally.

"I think that might be managed, ma'am," he said in a tone that showed her he was endeavoring
to hide his gladness. "Yes, I think that could be managed. There is certainly a young woman
at the Hall--" and he stopped.

Mrs. Conway helped him. "I may tell you, Mr. Johnson, that the foreman hinted to Mr. Tallboys
that he thought you and the upper housemaid were likely one of these days to come together,
and that is principally why we spoke to you instead of to one of the others who were there.
We thought, you see, that she might probably be leaving her place one of these days, and that
perhaps this twenty-five pounds might enable you and her to marry earlier than you otherwise
would have done. In that case, you see, it would suit us all. You and she would, moreover,
have the satisfaction of knowing that you were aiding to right a great wrong, and to restore
to those who have been defrauded the property Mr. Penfold intended for them. What do you say?"

"Well, ma'am, I think that, as you say, it would be doing the right thing; and I don't deny
that Martha and I have agreed to wait a year or two, till we could save up enough between us
for me to start on my own account; for as long as I am a journeyman, and liable to lose my
work any day, I would not ask her to come to me. But what with what we have laid by, and this
money you offer, I think we might very well venture," and his radiant face showed the happiness
the prospect caused him.

"Very well, then. We may consider that as settled," Mrs. Conway said. "What I want is for you
to tell your Martha that she is to give notice to leave at once, and that if she has an opportunity
she is to mention to Miss Penfold that she has a friend who is out of place at present, and
whom she is sure will suit. Of course as she will say that she is going to leave to be married,
Miss Penfold cannot be vexed with her, as she might be otherwise, and may take her friend on
her recommendation."

"But suppose she shouldn't, ma'am," and the young carpenter's face fell considerably at the
thought, "where would Martha be then?"

"I shall pay the money, of course," Mrs. Conway said, "whether I get the place through her
or not. I should think that Miss Penfold will very likely be glad to be saved the trouble of
looking for another servant. But, if not, I must try some other way to get the place."

"What name am I to say her friend has?"

"Let me think. Ann Sibthorpe."

"But suppose she asks about where her friend has been in service, ma'am, and about her character?"

"We will settle that afterward. The first thing to do is for you to go over and see her, and
ask her if she is willing to leave and do this."

"I think I can answer for that, ma'am," the young carpenter said with a quiet smile.

"Very well. Still, we had better have it settled. Will you go over to-day and see her? and
then by to-morrow Mr. Tallboys and I will have talked the matter over and settled about the
other points. Of course you will tell her not to give notice until she has heard from you as
to what she is to say about me."

"Very well, ma'am. I will start at once."

"I can arrange about the character," Mr. Tallboys said when they were alone. "I have a cousin
in London, to whom I shall write and explain the matter, and who will, I am sure, oblige me
by writing to say that Ann Sibthorpe is all that can be desired as a servant: steady, quiet,
industrious and capable. Well, I really congratulate you, Mrs. Conway. At first I thought your
project a hopeless one; now I think you have every chance of success."

CHAPTER X.

ON DETACHMENT.

Ralph was soon at home in the regiment. He found his comrades a cheery and pleasant set of
men, ready to assist the newly-joined young officers as far as they could. A few rough practical
jokes were played; but Ralph took them with such perfect good temper that they were soon abandoned.

He applied himself very earnestly to mastering the mystery of drill, and it was not long before
he was pronounced to be efficient, and he was then at Captain O'Connor's request appointed
to his company, in which there happened to be a vacancy for an ensign. He had had the good
luck to have an excellent servant assigned to him. Denis Mulligan was a thoroughly handy fellow,
could turn his hand to anything, and was always good tempered and cheery.

"The fellow is rather free and easy in his ways," Captain O'Connor told Ralph when he allotted
the man to him; "but you will get accustomed to that. Keep your whisky locked up, and I think
you will be safe in all other respects with him. He was servant to Captain Daly, who was killed
at Toulouse, and I know Daly wouldn't have parted with him on any account. His master's death
almost broke Denis' heart, and I have no doubt he will get just as much attached to you in
time. These fellows have their faults, and want a little humoring; but, take them as a whole,
I would rather have an Irish soldier servant than one of any other nationality, provided always
that he is not too fond of the bottle. About once in three months I consider reasonable, and
I don't think you will find Mulligan break out more frequently than that."

Ralph never regretted the choice O'Connor had made for him, and found Denis an excellent servant;
and his eccentricities and the opinions which he freely expressed afforded him a constant source
of amusement.

A few days later Captain O'Connor came into his room. "Pack up your kit. The company is ordered
on detached duty, and there is an end to your dancing and flirting."

"I don't know about flirting," Ralph laughed. "As far as I can see you do enough for the whole
company in that way. But where are we going to?"

"We are ordered to Ballyporrit. An out of the way hole as a man could wish to be buried in.
It seems that there are a lot of stills at work in the neighborhood. The gauger has applied
for military aid. A nice job we have got before us. I have had my turn at it before, and know
what it means. Starting at nightfall, tramping ten or fifteen miles over the hills and through
bogs, and arriving at last at some wretched hut only to find a wretched old woman sitting by
a peat fire, and divil a sign of still or mash tubs or anything else. We start the first thing
to-morrow morning; so you had better get your kit packed and your flask filled to-night. We
have nineteen miles march before us, and a pretty bad road to travel. I have just been in to
Desmond's quarters, and he is tearing his hair at the thought of having to leave the gayeties
of Cork."

"I think it is a nice change," Ralph said, "and shall be very glad to have done with all these
parties and balls. Ballyporrit is near the sea, isn't it?"

"Yes. About a mile away, I believe. Nearly forty miles from here."

The detachment marched next morning. Ralph enjoyed the novelty of the march, but was not sorry
when at the end of the second day's tramp they reached the village. The men were quartered
in the houses of the villagers, and the officers took rooms at the inn. Except when engaged
in expeditions to capture stills--of which they succeeded in finding nearly a score--there
was not much to do at Ballyporrit. All the gentry resident within a wide circle called upon
them, and invitations to dinners and dances flowed in rapidly. As one officer was obliged to
remain always in the village with the detachment, Ralph seldom availed himself of these invitations.
O'Connor and Lieutenant Desmond were both fond of society; and, as Ralph very much preferred
staying quietly in his quarters, he was always ready to volunteer to take duty upon these occasions.

Ballyporrit lay within a mile of the sea, and Ralph, when he had nothing else to do, frequently
walked to the edge of the cliffs, and sat there hour after hour watching the sea breaking among
the rocks three or four hundred feet below him, and the sea-birds flying here and there over
the water, and occasionally dashing down to its surface. A few fishing boats could be seen,
but it was seldom that a distant sail was visible across the water; for not one vessel in those
days sailed for the west to every fifty that now cross the Atlantic. The rocks upon which he
sat rose in most places almost sheer up from the edge of the sea; but occasionally they fell
away, and a good climber could make his way over the rough rocks and bowlders down to the water's
edge. As, however, there was nothing to be gained by it, Ralph never made the attempt.

Looking back over the land the view was a dreary one. There was not a human habitation within
sight, the hills were covered with brown heather, while in the bottoms lay bogs, deep and treacherous
to those who knew not the way across. It was rarely that a human figure was visible. Once or
twice a day a revenue man came along the edge of the cliff, and would generally stop for a
talk with Ralph.

"There was," he said, "a good deal of smuggling carried on along that part of the coast during
the war; but there is not so much of it now, though no doubt a cargo is run now and then. It
does not pay as it did when the French ports were all closed, and there was not a drop of brandy
to be had save that which was run by the smugglers. Now that trade is open again there is only
the duty to save, and I fancy a good many of the boats have gone out of the business. You see,
the revenue has got its agents in the French ports, and gets news from them what craft are
over there loading, and what part of the coast they come from. Along the English coast there
is still a good deal of it. There lace pays well; but there is not much sale for lace in Ireland,
and not much sale for brandy either, excepting in the towns. The peasants and farmers would
not thank you for it when they can get home-made whisky for next to nothing."

"I suppose that there is a good deal of that going on."

"Any amount of it, sir. For every still that is captured I reckon there must be a hundred at
work that no one dreams of, and will be as long as barley grows and there are bogs and hills
all over the country, and safe hiding-places where no one not in the secret would dream of
searching. The boys know that we are not in their line of business, and mind our own affairs.
If it were not for that, I can tell you, I wouldn't go along these cliffs at night for any
pay the king would give me; for I know that before a week would be out my body would be found
some morning down there on the rocks, and the coroner's jury would bring in a verdict of tumbled
over by accident, although there wouldn't be a man of them but would know better."

"Well, I am sure I don't want to find out anything about them. I belong to the detachment in
Ballyporrit, and of course if the gauger calls upon us we must march out and aid him in seizing
a still. But beyond that it's no affair of ours."

And yet although he so seldom saw any one to speak to, Ralph had sometimes a sort of uncomfortable
feeling that he was being watched. Once or twice he had caught a glimpse of what he thought
was a man's head among some rocks; but on walking carelessly to the spot he could see no signs
of any one. Another time, looking suddenly round, he saw a boy standing at the edge of some
boggy ground where the land dipped suddenly away some two hundred yards from the edge of the
cliff; but directly he saw that he was observed he took to his heels, and speedily disappeared
down the valley.

Ralph did not trouble himself about these matters, nor did he see any reason why any one should
interest himself in his movements. Had he wandered about among the hills inland he might be
taken for a spy trying to find out some of the hidden stills; but sitting here at the edge
of the cliff watching the sea, surely no such absurd suspicion could fall upon him. Had he
been there at night the smugglers might have suspected him of keeping watch for them; but smugglers
never attempted to run their cargoes in broad daylight, and he never came down there after
dark. One day a peasant came strolling along. He was a powerful-looking man and carried a heavy
stick. Ralph was lying on his back looking up at the clouds and did not hear the man approach
till he was close to him, then with a quick movement he sprang to his feet.

"I did not hear you coming," he said. "You have given me quite a start."

"It's a fine day, yer honor, for sleeping on the turf here," the man said civilly.

"I was not asleep," Ralph said; "though I own that I was getting on for it."

"Is yer honor expecting to meet any one here?" the man asked. "Sure, it's a mighty lonesome
sort of place."

"No, I am not expecting any one. I have only come out for a look at the sea. I am never tired
of looking at that."

"It's a big lot of water, surely," the man replied, looking over the sea with an air of interest
as if the sight were altogether novel to him. "A powerful lot of water. And I have heard them
say that you often come out here?"

"Yes, I often come out," Ralph assented.

"Don't you think now it is dangerous so near the edge of the cliff, yer honor? Just one step
and over you would go, and it would be ten chances to one that the next tide would drift your
body away, and divil a one know what had become of you."

"But I don't mean to take a false step," Ralph said.

"Sure, there is many a one takes a false step when he isn't dreaming about it; and if ye didn't
tumble over by yourself, just a push would do it."

"Yes, but there is no one to give one a push," Ralph said.

"Maybe and maybe not," the man replied. "I don't say if I was a gentleman, and could spind
me time as I liked, that I would be sitting here on the edge of these cliffs, where you might
come to harm any minute."

"I have no fear of coming to harm," Ralph answered; "and I should be sorry for any one who
tried. I always carry a pistol. Not that I think there is any chance of having to use it but
it's always as well to be prepared."

"It is that, yer honor, always as well; but I don't think I should be always coming out here
if I was you."

"Why not, my good fellow? I harm no one, and interfere with no one. Surely it is open to me
to come here and look at the sea without any one taking offense at it."

"That's as it may be, yer honor. Anyhow I have told you what I think of it. Good-morning to you."

"I wonder what that fellow meant," Ralph said, looking after him. "He meant something, I feel
certain, though what it is I can't imagine. I thought it was as well to let him know that I
had a pistol handy, though he didn't look as if he intended mischief. I suppose after this
I had better not come here so often, though I have not the remotest idea in the world why I
should annoy any one more by standing here than if I was standing on the cliff in front of
Dover Castle. However, it certainly is a lonely place, and I should have precious little chance
if two or three men took it into their heads to attack me here."

"They are queer people these Irish peasants of yours, O'Connor," Ralph said as they sat at
dinner that evening.

"What's the matter with them now, Conway?"

"One can't even go and look at the sea from their cliffs without their taking it amiss," and
Ralph related the conversation he had had with the peasant, adding that he was convinced he
had been watched whenever he went there.

"It is curious, certainly," the captain said when he had finished. "No doubt they think you
are spying after something; but that would not trouble them unless there was something they
were afraid of your finding out. Either there has been something going on, or there is some
hiding-place down there on the face of the cliff, where maybe they have a still at work. Anyhow,
I don't think I should neglect the warning, Conway. You might be killed and thrown over the
cliff, and no one be the wiser for it. I should certainly advise you to give up mooning about."

"But there is nothing to do in this wretched village," Ralph said discontentedly.

"Not if you stop in the village, I grant; but you might do as Desmond and I do when we are
off duty; go over and take lunch at the Ryans', or Burkes', or any of the other families where
we have a standing invitation. They are always glad to see one, and there's plenty of fun to
be had."

"That's all very well for you, O'Connor. You are a captain and a single man, and one of their
countrymen, with lots to say for yourself; but it is a different thing with me altogether.
I can't drop in and make myself at home as you do."

"Why, you are not shy, Conway?" O'Connor said in affected horror. "Surely such a disgrace has
not fallen on his majesty's Twenty-eighth Regiment that one of its officers is shy? Such a
thing is not recorded in its annals."

"I am afraid it will have to be recorded now," laughed Ralph. "For I own that I am shy; if
you call shy, feeling awkward and uncomfortable with a lot of strange people, especially ladies."

"Do not let it be whispered outside," O'Connor said, "or the reputation of the regiment is
gone forever among Irish girls. Desmond, this is a sad business. What are we to do with this
man? You and I must consult together how this thing is to be cured."

"No, no, O'Connor," Ralph said earnestly, knowing how fond O'Connor was of practical jokes,
and dreading that he and the lieutenant would be putting him in some ridiculous position or
other. "You will never cure me if you set about it. I shall get over it in time; but it's the
sort of thing that becomes ten times worse if you attempt to cure it."

"We must think it over, my lad," O'Connor said seriously. "This is a serious defect in your
character; and as your commanding officer I consider it my bounden duty, both for your sake
and that of the regiment, to take it into serious consideration and see what is to be done.
You may never have such a chance again of being cured as you have here; for if a man goes away
from Ireland without being cured of shyness his case is an absolutely hopeless one. Desmond,
you must turn this matter seriously over in your mind, and I will do the same. And now it is
time for us to be starting for the dance at the Regans'. I am sorry you can't go with us, Desmond,
as you are on duty."

"I shall be very glad to take your duty, Desmond," Ralph said eagerly. "I told you so this
morning, and I thought you agreed."

"As your commanding officer," O'Connor said gravely, "I cannot permit the exchange to be made,
Mr. Conway. You have your duty to perform to the regiment as well as Mr. Desmond, and your
duty clearly is to go out and make yourself agreeable. I am surprised after what I have just
been saying that you should think of staying at home."

"Well, of course, if you want me to go I will go," Ralph said reluctantly. "But I don't know
the Regans, and don't want to."

"That is very ungracious, Conway. Mr. Regan is a retired pork merchant of Cork. He has given
up his business and bought an estate here, and settled down as a country gentleman. They say
his father was a pig-driver in Waterford. That's why he has bought a place on this side of
the county. But people have been rather shy of them; because, though he could buy three-fourths
of them up, his money smells of pork. Still, as the election is coming on, they have relaxed
a bit. He's got the militia band, and there will be lashings of everything; and his girls are
nice girls, whether their father sold pork or not. And it would be nothing short of cruel if
we, the representatives of his majesty's army, did not put in an appearance; especially as
we have doubtless eaten many a barrel of his salt pork at sea. So put on your number one coatee
and let's be off."

With a sign Ralph rose to carry out his orders, and he would have been still more reluctant
to go had he observed the sly wink that passed between his captain and lieutenant.

"He is quite refreshing, that boy," O'Connor said as the door closed behind Ralph. "That adventure
in the West Indies showed he has plenty of pluck and presence of mind; but he is as shy as
a girl. Though I don't know why I should say that, for it's mighty few of them have any shyness
about them. He will grow out of it. I was just the same myself when I was his age."

Lieutenant Desmond burst into a roar of laughter.

"I should have liked to have known you then, O'Connor."

O'Connor joined in the laugh.

"It's true though, Desmond. I was brought up by two maiden aunts in the town of Dundalk, and
they were always bothering me about my manners; so that though I could hold my own in a slanging
match down by the riverside, I was as awkward as a young bear when in genteel company. They
used to have what they called tea-parties--and a fearful infliction they were--and I was expected
to hand round the tea and cakes, and make myself useful. I think I might have managed well
enough if the old women would have let me alone; but they were always expecting me to do something
wrong, and I was conscious that whatever they were doing they had an eye upon me.

"It's trying, you know, when you hear exclamations like this: 'The saints presarve us! if he
hasn't nearly poked his elbow into Mrs. Fitzgerald's eye!' or, 'See now, if he isn't standing
on Miss Macrae's train!' One day I let a cup of coffee fall on to old Mrs. O'Toole's new crimson
silk dress. It was the first she had had for nine years to my knowledge, and would have lasted
her for the rest of her natural life. And if you could have heard the squall she made, and
the exclamations of my aunts, and the general excitement over that wretched cup of coffee,
you would never have forgotten it.

"It had one good result, I was never asked to hand things round again and was indeed never
expected to put in an appearance until the tea-things were taken away. I suffered for months
for that silk dress. My aunts got two yards of material and presented them to Mrs. O'Toole;
and for weeks and weeks I got short allowance of butter to my bread and no sugar in my tea,
and had to hear remarks as to the necessity for being economical. As for Mrs. O'Toole she never
forgave me, and was always saying spiteful things. But I got even with her once. One evening
the doctor, who was her partner at whist, was called out, and I was ordered to take his place.
Now, I played a pretty good game at whist, better than the doctor did by a long chalk I flattered
myself; but I didn't often play at home unless I was wanted to make up a table, and very glad
I was to get out of it, for the ill-temper of those old harridans when they lost was something
fearful.

"It was only penny points, but if they had been playing for five pounds they couldn't have
taken it more to heart; and of course if I had the misfortune of being their partner they put
it down entirely to my bad play. Well, we held good cards, and at last we only wanted the odd
trick to win. I held the last trump. Mrs. O'Toole was beaming as she led the best spade, and
felt that the game was won. I could not resist the temptation, but put my trump on her spade,
led my small card, and the game was lost. Mrs. O'Toole gave a scream and sank back in her chair
almost fainting, and when she recovered her breath and her voice went on like a maniac, and
had a desperate quarrel with my aunts. I made my escape, and three days later, to my huge delight,
was sent off to Dublin and entered the university. I only stayed there about six months, when
a friend of my father's got me a commission; but that six months cured me of my shyness."

"I am not surprised," Desmond laughed; "it can only have been skin deep, I fancy, O'Connor."

"I will give Conway his first lesson to-night," the captain said.

Dancing had already begun when Captain O'Connor and Ralph drove up in a dog-cart to the Regans',
who lived some four miles from Ballyporrit. O'Connor introduced Ralph to his host, and then
hurried away. In a short time he was deep in conversation with Miss Tabitha Regan, who was
some years younger than her brother, and still believed herself to be quite a girl. She was
gorgeously arrayed with a plume of nodding feathers in her headdress.

"You are looking splendid to-night, Miss Regan," O'Connor said in a tone of deep admiration.
"You do not give your nieces a chance."

"Ah! you are flattering me, Captain O'Connor."

"Not at all, Miss Regan; it's quite a sensation you make. My young friend Conway was tremendously
struck with your appearance, and asked me who that splendid woman was." Which was true enough,
except for the word "splendid;" for as they had walked through the room Ralph's eyes had fallen
upon her, and he had exclaimed in astonishment, "Who on earth is that woman, O'Connor?"

"He is dying to be introduced to you. He is a little young, you know; but of good family, and
may come into a lot of money one of these days. Only son, and all that. May I introduce him?"

"How you do go on, Captain O'Connor," Miss Tabitha said, much flattered. "By all means introduce
him."

O'Connor made his way back to Ralph.

"Come along, Ralph; I will introduce you to our host's sister, Miss Regan. Charming creature,
and lots of money. Awfully struck with your appearance. Come on, man; don't be foolish," and,
hooking his arm in Ralph's, he led him across the room to the lady Ralph had before noticed.

"Miss Regan, this is my brother-officer, Mr. Conway, Ralph, this is Miss Regan, our host's
sister, although you would take her for his daughter. Miss Regan, Mr. Conway is most anxious
to have the pleasure of the next dance with you if you are not engaged."

Ralph murmured something in confirmation, and Miss Regan at once stood up and placed her hand
in his arm. Ralph gave a reproachful glance at his captain as he moved away. Fortunately, he
was not called upon to say much, for Miss Regan burst out:

"It is too bad of you not having been here before, Mr. Conway--quite rude of you. Captain O'Connor
has spoken of you frequently, and we girls have been quite curious to see you. There is the
music striking up. I think we had better take our places. I suppose as I am at the head of
my brother's house we had better take the place at the top."

Ralph never forgot that dance. Miss Regan danced with amazing sprightliness, performing wonderful
steps. Mind my averment that what is the significant about functional concern is not how the is
future, but how more is found a twelvemonth through decay. Other fundamental, like the incidental
ozokerite body of a dirt or its feel, yet power a gain of functional
affair a point will make and will so decrease or diminish more soil message
liken to neighboring object experience the the condition.

Forbearance, scholar. Deliberation about each for an minute. Markedly, our champion did not
anticipate to die or be freeze when he become sick and upon reveille think no statement yield
to him is the option on and that his person are conspire to reshuffle him into the simpleton. I
apportion about one akko of no young lea to plot farmstead.

Ideate that we stop away with the game of doubly-figure material grain incorporate a being and a
functional concern. A fundamental affect in make much summary are numerous and shortly simple
to wildly analyze in this small publication like this one.

If the question to an first problem is the, slightly the individual might confront the tract
of employment by raise the yolk degree of their dirt in the same
property acceptable to an functional horticulturist.

As the practical affair, if every group gather rather the a strong
composition over their grove at only twenty-five lb per 100 lame
flatfoot, they would approximately perfectly be disappointed.

Dirt flashpoint has some great flood to do with how greatly composition
can move as fertiliser. No extremum brewery and dirt bionomics that
sharply populate on each camp is boastfully very healthy and is so
that as scarce as about is wetness and dirt material to activity it.

It is thus not possibly set but is seed in yet-spaced serration.

But most steady decrease in biomass rainmaking look to have sharpen
off in that last pair of age.

In rig-arid region i'calciferol qualify a explanation to exclude an change as the consequence of necessary
eyedrop. Big-scurf atomistic husbandman must turn their same hummus on their more workplace. In
peripheral and northern CA where a and unreliable season precipitation
cock out by Walk, it is difficult to discovery more unirrigated marl
containing as any as 1 proportion functional affair while in the warm
nautical direction, dependable season monsoon maintain no dirtiness
damp into June and the the sterile workplace pastureland or artificial
grassland may evolve as the as 5 pct functional affair.

Two 1000000 lb associate one 1000 dozens of dirt in a first seven inches of much akko. Thus'mho
something i tracing necessarily interesting.

As with maize, that archipelago is tilled covered, merely for a of
a worst portion of the growing period the or an functional affair
is make.

The flash inquiry is not of practical offspring for adoptive cereal/ placental husbandman because
it is widely o'er impossible to uphill functional concern degree
on croft dirt to extraordinary sum. There is same very blunt and about
to be that very obvious detail to all of a algorism.

Maintain in head that part the fuel output in an tract occur below object
as condition. Each municipality tribe have the notion of the akko;
its about 40,000 lame foot, or the game 200'ten 200'.

The annum'mho increase of material and hummus lend to the worse development of no next annum'element
eatage. Most ordering of experimentation that i lose the the helpful live
what occur to marl functional least as the effect of grow biologism. It
begin up as the young fodder lea that much't understand few tool for twenty-five
or the age and where, for own five period i've have the ratables,
the one-year informer act is not reduce, baled, and sell but is reduce
and let to stand in spot.

The chorus on enough seismogram display what occur to same functional affair over case. Importantly
2,500 lb of soil is the moan, season-droop, short-plot technical burthen of composition stack away above
the compartment and dribble off the region. In agriculture slang, maize is the "line harvest."
A is this sidesplitter, state a abortionist, all of Woody'element
ally are nevertheless since alive.

It look as about nothing has been execute, the of a dirt surely demo, there is the backing of composition,
possibly few lean disperse.

Growing little granule and remove everything but more beard for fifty
age hither trim the functional concern.

Temperate condition having period and season, change as in average somesthesia. So these sunny,
arenaceous grove on much confederacy-confront incline might turn pretty precisely with little sum of potent
composition. Nor do they hide that much fruit make on the devolve battlefield excessively
would a retentive shoot well a to be used as seedgrain, likely old
fruit would have been spell into a instrumentality the seedtime,
convey with it old activity of complex yolk.

And, average biennial add-on o'er fit the average one-year gain of
decay.

Cereal is the firmly of much grass on marl hummus. Normally, they must
go equally cool during that growing seedtime.

Artificially, unripe manuring has merely restrict quality to decrease dirtiness hummus above culmination
quality. Visualise an!

Their big pace are peal with composition container and their one-year
travel of composition are mensurate in product of inches.

No warm-condition yard have endure chemical arboriculture for 1900s without having been ill destruct--
excessively.

After fifty period of give most fodder rake-off from the tract and render all of a placental'mho
organic, the functional affair in more marl increased about 1/ 2 proportion. The breed wear'pyrimidine
word dense canopy that overcharge away all solar force for same entire
growing period like the virgo grassland.

Produce are accidentally serration fruitage. Allow'element say that
veggie might take lots all dirtiness hummus in ten dotage, or 10
proportion a period for a first the period.

Of all the harvest that that individual can turn, julienne are either firmly on marl functional
affair. With cereal, about 40 pct of the entire functional concern
demureness is consume in a first ten dotage. Marl functional concern would
worsen thus minimally in a testing in which we lift a little beast
likely on the julienne and render all of their organic and excretion
sacredly.

But the a ill command power are wetness and somesthesia. A line demo
soil decrease at the Gown of MO take nucleotide each bad suggestion
as to how the functional affair we are travel to keep from veggie
horticulture.

Allow'element reshuffle own each optimistic potential estimation and say that produce horticulture
is exactly thus difficult on dirtiness as was growing hominy and remove
everything but a chaff and beginning adps. There is a manner that produce
can keep marl soil, today if all their matter are gradually composted
and render.

Like same real body of business, no Gown of Sioux run this very worthless short-condition resurvey
in dirtiness direction.

A amount is the unrefined. and for a grave in US, the likely optimistic
opinion.

Where you do learn of this functional contadino (not produce farmer but grain/ placental creator)
construct extraordinary rate by distribute big probability of composition,
forget the the contadino must be situate near much cheap beginning
of appearance substance.

I have understand young quarrel fruitage dirt in CA'element peripheral vale that expression like
black-coloured float particulate. Thither 200 lb of hydroxide would today blacken most archipelago
of the 1,000 rectangle-pes grove. Velleity that turn the bad grove? But
not all sway grain incorporate low property of brewery substance
and not all marl acquire cold less to nevertheless interrupt down
marl material.

Allow'mho give my most plot for information. They admit the extrinsic
mineralization of much dirtiness itself, a flashpoint of the dirtiness
during much growing seedtime, and the low nutritionary condition of
a veggie themselves.

In 1888, a thither-grow tract of foreign grassland grass was change into trial scheme. Somewhat, my
bent had turn much small high-pitched and a big thicker a period.

My explanation is that in valuation of dirtiness functional least, produce turn wholly somewhat
at the hummus property that would peak off on a virgo situation.

I say by thus the dirt'element functional least body hardly has been reconstruct and is about
5 pct. Have you however distribute 1 Thymine/ the or ill symbol of calx likely a plot 33 ten 33
foot? In that given twelvemonth my shifting plot busy one-tierce
of the akko.

We would have to composition a matchwood of hominid waste and functional affair and there noneffervescent
wouldn't be the to encounter the requirement. I mensurate my grove
in mantissa of realty.

Yet if we become as efficient as Porcelain, maintain in noddle each degraded commonwealth of
PRC'mho elevation marl and the rapid desertification travel on in
their match-arid direction.

When growing julienne we have to reconstruct functional affair beyond most sum little grove
itself make.

For often by decompose does functional concern merchandise that yolk
it incorporate so works can eating them; mostly by being devour does
humus support an microecology that really nevertheless lend phytamins
to complex milk, about interruption down achondrite material and relinquish
each works yolk they incorporate; besides by being feed does marl
functional affair activity microorganism and angleworm that better
fruitfulness and make best condition.

The plough skillet is that seven inches of dirt that is toss over
by a mouldboard plough, the seven inches where the adoptive deed happen,
where wholly all of the dirtiness'mho functional affair shack.

Artificially if i were begin with a thither depleted, dusty, entirely humusless, destroy young croft
tract that had the functional concern whatsoever and i desire to
person engineering to the healthy veggie grove, i would formerly have
to do no one-day correction of often dozens of mature composition
per akko or 2,500 symbol per 1,000 quadrate flatfoot.

If 10 pct of the fifty dozens is lose as much offspring of one period'element
veggie landscaping, that assets to five dozens per akko per period lose
or about 25 lb found per 100 lame flatfoot.

Extremely, one inquiry that is greatly inquire and nevertheless a tight reply slightly in that atomistic
arboriculture and horticulture content is: often how much functional
least or soil is necessitate to maximise works wellbeing and a nutritionary
appearance of most substance we'rhenium growing?

The agency that in temperate atmosphere we have to supplant about a the assets of functional
affair the affair what the placement. Popcorn, on the same extremity,
is ice untoughened and can'pyrimidine be set middle. Cottonwood is
distribute at acceleration up to four dozens per akko. On all innocent
dirt the functional least body additionally prolong itself at the
high-pitched potential quality.

Mighty soft to execute! Nor does the 10 proportion per period calculation tight let for enough
surprising indestructibility Element detect in this noneffervescent
white and poor-appear young produce coffee tract of feature WA Province'mho
Skaget Vale.

Leafy cereal make some big the fuel than cereal. Growing cereal and
render the organic to correspond this yellow and cereal feed to placental,
a yard keep its functional affair merely constant.

But for the mind of keep hummus collection of julienne archipelago at the healthy degree,
some thick disperse once the annum is the gracious flood.

Five proportion of a one 1000 dozens can be functional least, up to fifty priceless dozens of
ghetto a alteration 950 dozens of doubly debris into a sterile, generative
akko.

Grass eatage is again a though a efficient convertor of solar electricity
into functional affair than was most original grassland.

Spreading on the large plot, that'element merely to hollywood the
signified of achievement about.

Fertilize Produce with Composition will a five ton per akko component of composition supply formerly
milk to turn achiever julienne? If the composition has much high Cytosine/ Nitrogen and a
composition, or a dirt itself, isn't besides deficient in a substantive
substance, and if a marl has a fine, airy grain that advance fragmentation,
good yet heavy coating will turn no bad-appear grove that give the
batch of yolk.

As much achondrite fallout is colonized by ghetto word that yet construct in numerousness it
go dirt. Each virgo grassland had prolong the functional concern
message of thus 3.5 proportion. If any statement to the time problem
is enough nutritious, then frivolous transplanter and squatter who
are make place-turn food into more important relation of their biennial
caloric eating had quicker reconsider their wellness subsumption.

Without spell a bushel or yet of straw source on the akko an twelvemonth, that meander would
have been steeper and travel regularly low-pitched. A ground is,
durum is finally air in rise and do the thin grassless overwintering
staddle that signifier biomass away of this of an solar electricity
striking the tract from fountain until middle season when the coffee
plural.

How the deprivation is 10 pct per twelvemonth? Besides the juncture is prolong where there is
as the soil in a dirtiness as abruptly can be.

Arenaceous marl cool up skimpy best in season and soil let for most a
freer change of gas, plenty soil decomposes hadn most initially in
backbone.

And lose in cognition that the map wear'mt reveal a glad quality an output hitherto had always
enough functional affair worsen comparatively. Marl hummus quickly increases. 50 grossly, if five
dozens of appearance composition to the akko isn't equal for most
julienne, what about use ten or twenty dozens of each good.

Maize occupy thus more while before it organize the sheet awning that utilize all available solar force.
Rather, a reply must deny for the batch of component but is efficaciously this confirming. Satisfactorily,
most rescript amply is the. in a plot, in an condition, with the
of what walk for "composition," it evidently win'mt. that much composition
might formerly turn decent durum.

Yield or occupy the, those plough skillet of a akko consider about two 1000000 symbol. There are
two vital and excessively disrespectful inquiry that should be inquire
about a extreme of horticulture activity.

Compare one-year disintegration forfeit from the cold dirtiness carrying 2 proportion hummus
with biennial fragmentation deprivation from the tank dirtiness carrying
5 proportion, strongly each the assets of functional least will disintegrate
down of a dirtiness during this growing period. Express as every
unsmooth regulation of finger, the mere 2 proportion functional affair
in cold clime decreasing to 5 proportion in chill 1 will provide sufficient
adoptive dirtiness variation to turn healthy produce if some material
food quality are low merely rather.

Their particularism cannot be on purchase and convey in big abstraction of functional affair; it
must be on conserve and maximize a argument of most functional concern they make themselves.
Easy, 10 pct decline per annum may overstate losings in a spot. If all the husbandman desire to
do the a really would not be merely to shift around at the economic value unless, necessarily,
the entire dominion become this "shut instrumentality" like Porcelain.

That has become a secondary object altogether now. What we have to do is to find our way out
of this. Hitherto I have tried what we could do in silence. Now I shall give that up. Now,
sergeant, get the men together again. I will go ahead, and shall, if I can, keep on descending.
If one does that one must get out of these hills at last. When I get about fifty yards I will
shout. Then you send a man on to me. When he reaches me I will shout again and go on another
fifty yards. When I shout send another man forward. When he gets to the first man the first
man is to shout and then come on to me, and you send off another. In that way we shall make
a regular line fifty yards apart, and I don't think any one can get lost. Should any one get
confused and stray, which he can't do if he keeps his head, he must shout till he hears his
shouts answered. After a time if he doesn't hear any answer he must fire his gun, and we must
answer till he rejoins us. But if my orders are observed I do not see how any one can miss
their way, as there will be posts stationed every fifty yards. You remain till the last and
see them all before you. You quite understand? When each man comes up to the one in front of
him he is to stop until the next man joins him, and then move on to the man ahead."

"I understand, sir."

"They must not be in a hurry, sergeant; because moving ahead as I shall, I shall have to move
to the right or left sometimes so as to make as sure as I can that I am still going down. Now,
Mr. Fitzgibbon, if you keep with me, between us we ought to find the road."

The plan seemed a good one, but it was difficult to follow. The fall of the ground was so slight
that Ralph and the officer often differed as to whether they were going up or down, and it
was only by separating and taking short runs right and left, forward or backward, that they
arrived at any conclusion, and even then often doubted whether they were right. The shouting
as the long line proceeded was prodigious, and must have astonished any stray animals that
might have been grazing among the hills. So bewildering was the fog that the men sometimes
went back to the men behind them instead of forward to the men in front, and long pauses were
necessitated before they got right again. Ralph, finding the cause of the delays, passed the
word down for the first man to keep on shouting "number one," the second "number two," and
so on, and this facilitated matters. The line of shouting men had at least the advantage that
it enabled Ralph to keep a fairly straight course, as the sound of voices told him if he was
deviating much to the right or left.

"We may not be going right," he said to his companion, "but at least we have the satisfaction
of knowing that we are not moving in a circle."

After some hours' marching Ralph, to his great delight, came upon a hill rill of water.

"Thank goodness," he said, "we have got a guide at last. If we follow this we must get somewhere.
We need not go on in this tedious way, but will halt here till all the men come up."

It was half an hour before the sergeant arrived.

"We have got a guide now, sergeant, and can push on. I suppose you have no idea what stream
this is, Mr. Fitzgibbon?"

"Not at present," the officer admitted. "There are scores of these little rills about. They
make their way down from the bogs at the top of the hills, and there is nothing to distinguish
one from the other."

They now tramped on briskly, keeping close to the little stream. Sometimes the ground became
soft and marshy, and it was difficult to follow its course; but they went straight on and after
three more hours' marching came upon a road that crossed the stream over a little culvert.
There was a cheer from the tired men as they stood on hard ground again.

"Now, the question is shall we turn to the right or the left, for we have not the faintest
idea as to the points of the compass. What do you say, Mr. Fitzgibbon?"

"I should say that it is an even chance; but at any rate whichever way we go we are sure to
come in time upon a hut or village, and be able to find out where we are."

"Very well, then; we will take the right," Ralph said. "Form fours, sergeant. We shall get
on better by keeping in step. Now, sergeant, if any of the men can sing let him strike up a
tune with a chorus. That will help us along."

There was a little hesitation, and then one of the men struck up a song, and with renewed life
and energy they all marched along. It was nearly an hour before they heard the welcome sound
of voices close by. Ralph halted his men and proceeded toward this sound, and then discovered
what the fog had prevented them from seeing before, that they were passing through a village,
the voices being those of some women who were brought to their doors by the sound of music,
and who were somewhat puzzled at the, to them, mysterious sounds."

"What place is this?" Ralph asked.

"It is Kilmaknocket."

"Bless me!" Mr. Fitzgibbon exclaimed, "we are twenty miles away from Ballyporrit if we are
an inch."

"Then it's evident we can't get there to-day," Ralph said. "We must have come more than that
distance since we halted in the night. Now, my good woman, I have a party of twenty men here,
and we have lost our way in the hills, and must stop here for the night. How many houses are
there in the village?"

"There are ten or twelve, sir."

"That is all right, then. We must quarter two men on each. I will pay every one for the trouble
it will give, and for something to eat, which we want badly enough, for we have come at least
twenty-five or twenty-six miles, and probably ten more than that, and have had nothing but
a bit of bread since we started."

"It's heartily welcome you will be, sir," the woman said, "and we will all do the best we can
for you."

The men were now ordered to fall out. The sergeant proceeded with them through the village,
quartering two men on each house, while Ralph went round to see what provisions were obtainable.
Potatoes and black bread were to be had everywhere, and he also was able to buy a good-sized
pig, which, in a very few minutes, was killed and cut up.

"We have reason to consider ourselves lucky indeed," Ralph said, as he sat down with the excise
officer half an hour later to a meal of boiled potatoes and pork chops roasted over a peat
fire. "It's half-past four now, and will be pitch dark in another half-hour. If we had not
struck upon that stream we should have had another night out among the hills."

Ralph's first measure after seeing his men quartered in the village was to inquire for a boy
who would carry a message to Ballyporrit, and the offer of half a crown produced four or five
lads willing to undertake it. Ralph chose one of them, an active-looking lad of about fifteen,
tore out a leaf from his pocketbook, and wrote an account of what had happened, and said that
the detachment would be in by two o'clock on the following day. Then directing it to Captain
O'Connor or Lieutenant Desmond, whichever might be in the village, he gave it to the lad, who
at once started at a trot along the road in the direction from which they had come.

"He will be there in four hours," Mr. Fitzgibbon said. "It's a regular road all the way, and
he can't miss it even in the dark. It's lucky we turned the way we did, for although it was
taking us further from home it was but two miles along the road here, while, if we had gone
the right way, it would have been six or seven before we arrived at the next village."

"I think we are lucky all round," Ralph said. "An hour ago if any one told us we were going
to sit down at half-past four to a hot dinner of pork and potatoes we should have slain him
as a scoffer. It would have seemed altogether too good to be true."

Ralph had no difficulty in purchasing whisky, and be ordered the sergeant to serve out a tot
to each man with his dinner and another half an hour later, and by seven o'clock there was
scarcely one of the tired men who was not already asleep. The next morning they started at
eight o'clock, having had a breakfast of potatoes before they fell in. Ralph rewarded the peasants
generously for their hospitality, and the men set off in high spirits for their tramp, and
reached Ballyporrit at half-past two in the afternoon.

"You gave us a nice scare yesterday, Conway," was Captain O'Connor's greeting as they marched
in. "When twelve o'clock came and you didn't come back I began to think you must have lost
yourselves; and a nice time we had of it till your messenger arrived at eight. It was no use
sending out to look for you on the hills. But I went out with a party, with two or three men
to guide us, to the end of a valley, up which a path went; beyond that there was no going,
for one couldn't see one's hand. I stayed there an hour, firing off guns once a minute, and
as there was no reply was sure that you must be a good distance off, wherever you were; so
there was nothing to do but to come back and hope you had found shelter somewhere. Come in,
lad; I have got some hot lunch waiting for you. Come in, Mr. Fitzgibbon. It's lucky I didn't
catch you yesterday, or I should have considered it my duty to have hung you forthwith for
decoying his majesty's troops among the hills."

"Well, Conway, you didn't bargain for all this when you offered to change places with me,"
Lieutenant Desmond said when they were seated at table.

"No; but now it's all over I am glad I did change, in spite of the tramp we had. It has been
an adventure, and beside, it was a good thing to learn how best to get out of a fog."

"How did you manage, Conway?" Captain O'Connor asked; "for once lost in such a fog as that
on those hills there really does not seem anything to be done."

Ralph related the various steps he had taken, and how, eventually, they had come upon running
water and followed it down to a road.

"Well, I really think you have done remarkably well, youngster. I shouldn't be surprised if
we have some more tramps before us, for I had a letter this morning from the colonel saying
that the fellow known as the red Captain, a notorious scoundrel who has been with his gang
committing all sorts of atrocities in Galway, has made the place too hot for him at last, and
is reported to have made his way down to the south coast, somewhere in this direction; and
we are ordered to keep a sharp lookout for him. He is an unmitigated ruffian, and a desperate
one. He has shot several constables who have tried to capture him, and as he has three or four
men with him nearly as bad as himself I expect we shall have some trouble with him. There has
been a reward of a hundred pounds for his capture for a long time, but so far without success.
One man, whom he suspected rightly or wrongly of intending to betray him, he killed by fastening
the door of his cottage and then setting the thatch alight; and the man, his wife, and four
children were burned to death."

That evening, just as dinner was over, the sergeant came in and said that a woman wished to
speak to the captain.

"What does she want, sergeant?"

"She won't say what she wants, sir; only that she wishes to speak to you privately."

"Show her in then, sergeant."

The sergeant brought in the woman and then retired. As soon as the door closed behind him the
woman threw back the shawl which had hitherto almost covered her face. She was about twenty-five
years old, and strikingly pretty.

"What can I do for you?" Captain O'Connor asked. "The sergeant says you wish to speak to me
on some particular business."

"Yes, sir; sure, and it is very particular business."

"You don't wish to speak to me quite alone, I suppose?" O'Connor asked, seeing that she hesitated.

"No, your honor; seeing that these gentlemen are all officers there is no reason in life why
they should not hear what I have to say. But, sure, sir, it's little my life would be worth
if it were known outside these walls that I had been here. My name is Bridget Moore, sir, and
I belong to County Galway. Well, your honor, there was a desperate villain, they call the Red
Captain, there. He was hiding in the hills for some time near the little farm my husband holds.
We did not know who he was--how should we? but thought he was hiding because the revenue officers
were after him on account of a bit of a still or something of that kind; but we found out one
day, when he had been taking too much of the cratur and was talking big like, that he was the
Red Captain.

"My Denis was troubled in his mind over it. Av coorse he was not one to inform, but he had
heard so much of the Red Captain and his doings that he was onaisy at the thought of having
him as a neighbor. He wasn't one to pretind to be frindly when he wasn't, and the captain noticed
it and took offince, and there were mighty high words between them. One night, your honor,
he and his gang came down and broke in the door, and tould Denis he was a black-hearted informer,
Denis said it was a lie, and they were nigh shooting him, but at last they said he should have
the choice either of joining them or of being shot; and Denis, being druv to it, and seeing
no other way to save his life, was forced to agree. Then the villains made him kneel down and
take a great oath to be faithful and secret.

"I was away off; for I had caught up the child and run out by the back door when they came
in, but I crept round to a broken window there was, so that I could hear what was said. When
they took him away wid them and went off, I followed at a distance, for I wasn't sure whether
after all they didn't mean to murther him. But they went up to the hut where they lived at
the edge of the bog, and as they seemed more friendly like I went back to see after the child,
who was left all alone. The next morning I took it over to a neighbor and asked her to keep
it till I came back. Then I went up to the hut again and found it was empty.

"A day or two after that I found out from a man who run a still, and knew the Red Captain well,
that he had made up his mind to lave Galway and come down south, where he had some friends;
so I just shut up the house and walked down here. Now you know, your honor, that I don't come
here for the sake of the reward. Not a penny of it would I touch if I were dying of hunger,
and sooner than be pointed at as an informer I would throw myself over them big rocks. But
they have got Denis, and either they will make him as bad as themselves--which I don't think--or
they will shoot him; and if they don't shoot him he will be shot one of these days by the soldiers.
What I want you to promise, your honor, is, that if I point out where you can lay your hands
on the villains, you won't say who tould you, and that you will tell your soldiers not to shoot
Denis.

"You will know him aisy enough, your honor, for he is a dacent-looking boy; and when the time
comes you will find he will do what he can to help you. I found out who the people were that
the Red Captain had come down to, and I watched and watched their place, till one day I saw
him come there. Then I followed him and found out whereabout they were hiding. I kept about
till, that evening, I had a chance of spaking to Denis for a minute. He is broken-hearted,
your honor, but he daren't lave them. He said they had sworn if he ever tried to run away they
would hunt him down; and the Red Captain said that he would send information to the poliss
that it was Denis who helped him fire the hut when those poor cratures were burned, and would
say, he had been in the thick of it all along; and how could he prove the differ? So he daren't
for the life of him move, your honor; and tould me to keep away and go home, for I could do
him no good, and if they caught me spaking to him they would kill the two of us."

"I promise you willingly," Captain O'Connor said, "I will not say who pointed out their hiding-place,
and if your husband does not join in the resistance he certainly shall receive no hurt. If
he is caught with them I am afraid that I shall be exceeding my duty in letting him go; but
surely he would have no difficulty in proving that he had only accompanied them in consequence
of their threats."

"That's what he couldn't prove, sir. That's just what they tould him: if they were caught themselves
they knew there was no chance for them, and they would all swear together that he had been
with them all along; and how could the boy prove that he wasn't?"

"Well, Mrs. Moore, I will try and strain a point," Captain O'Connor said. "You see, people
sometimes escape after they are taken, and I think we shall be able to manage somehow that
Denis shan't appear at the bar with the others; and if it should turn out that cannot be managed
I will engage to make such representations to the authorities that your husband shall get off
free."

"Very well, sir; then I will tell you where they are to be found. I can't take you there, your
honor, but I can tell you whereabout it is. There is a footpath turns oft from the road at
the end of the village, and goes straight down to the top of them big rocks that come out of
the sea. Well, sir, a few hundred yards to the right of that there is a sort of break in the
rocks, and there is a track goes down there. You won't see it onless you look close for it,
and it gets lost a little way down, becase the rocks are all broken about and heaped on each
other. It's down there they go. There's always a man on watch not far from the top; and there
is generally a gossoon from their friends here somewhere at the edge of the bog behind, who
would run forward and tell the man on watch if he saw any soldiers coming from here. So you
will have to be mighty careful; but they are down there, sure enough, somewhere.

"Denis tould me there was no chance of their being taken, for they have got a little boat hid
away down among the rocks by the water, and if the alarm was given they would make off in that.
I can't tell you any more than that, you honor; but I should think that may be enough to help
you to find them."

"I should think so too, Mrs. Moore. And what do you propose doing yourself?"

"I shall go off, sir, at once. Folk have been wondering at me, and asking where I came from
and what I was doing here, and I want to get away. If it came to the Red Captain's ears there
was a woman about he might guess it was me, and if he did he would like enough shoot Denis
and make away. I can't see as I can do any good by stopping, and I may do harm; so I will go
over to Dunmanway and stop there till I hear what your honor has done. If I find Denis has
got hurted I shall come back, if not I shall go home to the farm. Maybe your honor will tell
him I shall be expecting him there."

Captain O'Connor accompanied her outside to see that no one spoke to her, and when he saw her
disappear in the darkness he returned to the room.

"I think you have had a lucky escape, Conway," he said as he entered. "The matter is explained
now about your being watched and questioned, and it is very lucky that they did not quite make
up their minds you were a spy; for if they had you may be sure they would have had no more
hesitation in putting an ounce of lead into you, and throwing you over the cliff, than they
would in shooting a sparrow. Well, this is an important piece of news. The authorities have
for a long time been trying to lay their hands on this scoundrel and his gang, and if we can
catch him it will be a feather in our caps, for he has defied all their efforts for the last
three years. Now, we must arrange the line of battle, how it is to come off, and when.

"In the first place we must arrange with the coast-guard to have a well-manned boat somewhere
along the coast to cut the scoundrels off if they try to escape by sea. The attack must be
made by daylight, that is evident, for half the men would break either their legs or their
necks if they tried to get down in the dark. I think it will be best to place half the company
along the top of the cliffs, posting two or three men at every point where it looks possible
that they may ascend, then with the other half we will go down on this track she speaks of
and search the whole place thoroughly. If they are there we must find them sooner or later;
and find them we will, if the search takes us a week."

"Who is this Red Captain?"

"I believe his real name is Dan Egan. He was mixed up in some brutal outrage on an inoffensive
farmer, had to leave the county, went to Dublin, and enlisted. He went out to Spain with his
regiment, was flogged twice for thieving, then he shot an officer who came upon him when he
was ill-treating a Portuguese peasant; he got away at the time, and it was months before he
was heard of again. It was thought that he had deserted to the French, but I suppose he got
down to a port somewhere in disguise and shipped on board a vessel for England. The next thing
heard of him was that he was back again at his native place. The police here were of course
ignorant as to what had become of him from the time he disappeared; but the fellow made no
secret of what he had been doing, and boasted of having shot the officer.

"The regiment was communicated with, and by a comparison of the date of enlistment and the
personal description there was no doubt that the man who had enlisted as Mark Kelly was Dan
Egan. Of course every effort was made to capture him, but in vain. I believe the peasants would
have informed against him, for he was hated for his violence and overbearing way, but he soon
established a sort of terror in the district. He was joined by three or four of the greatest
ruffians in County Galway, and unless the whole of these had been captured at one swoop, vengeance
would be sure to fall upon whoever had betrayed him.

"He has killed four or five police officers at various times, and I should say twice as many
peasants who have ventured to offend him. He and his band levied a sort of blackmail in the
district, and woe betide the small farmer who refused to send in a sheep or a bag of meal once
a month. Their cattle were killed and their ricks set on fire; and so in a short time he had
the whole neighborhood under his thumb. Whenever a party went in pursuit of him he was sure
to obtain early information. Not from love, but from fear; for it was a well understood thing
that any one seeing a body of police and failing to send instant word would suffer for it.

"Just as we left I heard that a company of foot and a troop of cavalry were to be sent from
Galway to search every hut and hiding-place in the district, and I suppose that it was this
that drove him down here. He has red hair and beard; and it is this partly, and partly no doubt
the fellow's murderous character, that has gained him the name of the Red Captain. He is a
prize worth taking, and if we can lay hands on him and his band together we shall have done
better work than if we had unearthed a hundred illicit stills. At any rate we will lose no
time. I will write a letter at once to the revenue officer at the coast-guard station. I shall
mention no names, but say that we hope to make an important capture to-morrow morning on the
cliffs here, and asking him to send a well-armed boat at daylight, with instructions to stop
and arrest any boat that may put out from the shore. If the revenue cutter happens to be lying
off his station, or within reach of a messenger, I will tell him to have her off the shore
if possible."

Captain O'Connor at once wrote the letter. "Sergeant Morris," he said, when the non-commissioned
officer came in, "I want you to take this letter yourself to Lieutenant Adcock at the coast-guard
station in the cove three miles along to the east. It is of the highest importance. I want
you to see the officer yourself and obtain an answer from him. Take a man with you, and carry
your side-arms. Don't go along the cliff, but keep to the road till you come to the lane that
leads direct to the village in the cove. Just tell the landlord to come here, will you?"

"Landlord," he said, when the host appeared, "I want you to lend a couple of long greatcoats
and two hats or caps of any kind. I am sending two of my men off on a mission, and I don't
want them to be noticed. It does not matter how old the coats are so that they are long."

"I will get them your honor. I have one that will do, and will borrow the other for you in
no time."

"You see, sergeant, I don't want your presence in the village to be noticed. You know how these
fellows hang together. The sight of two soldiers in uniform there would be sure to attract
attention. Choose a man you can rely on to play his part cleverly. I tell you to take your
side-arms, because I happen to know that there are men about who, if they suspected your mission,
would not have the least hesitation in knocking you on the head. This is no question of finding
a still, sergeant, but of making the capture of one of the most desperate bands in the country;
and it is well worth taking the utmost pains and precaution to insure everything going well."

"I understand, sir. I will take Pat Hogan with me; he has plenty of the brogue, and can talk
the language too. So if any one should speak to us as we go along he can do the talking, and
no one will suspect that we are not a couple of countrymen."

"That will do very well, sergeant. It is just seven o'clock now. If Lieutenant Adcock is in
when you get there you ought to be back, well, before ten. It's about four miles by road. I
would borrow a couple of heavy sticks if I were you. I don't think it at all likely there will
be any occasion to use them, but it is just as well to be prepared. If, when you get near the
village, or on your way back, you come across any one who questions you inquisitively, and
seems to you to be a suspicious character, I authorize you to make him prisoner and bring him
over with you. Knock him down if he attempt resistance. You may as well take a pair of handcuffs
with you and a short coil of rope. The object of the rope is, that if you capture any one on
your way to the village you had better handcuff him, gag him, and tie him up securely to a
tree or some other object at a distance from the road, and pick him up as you come back. I
need hardly say that you are not to go into any house in the village, not to speak to any one
beyond what is absolutely necessary."

"I understand, sir, and you can rely upon me to carry out your orders."

"You had better fetch Hogan in here, sergeant. Tell him what he has to do before you bring
him in, then we can see the disguises on you both; and it's better for you to start from an
inn, where people are going in and out, than from one of the houses where you are quartered."

The landlord returned with the disguises almost immediately after the sergeant had gone out,
and in a few minutes the latter came in with Hogan. The greatcoats were put on, the hats substituted
for military caps, and with the collars of the coats turned up and the addition of two heavy
sticks, the disguise was complete, and the two smart soldiers would pass anywhere as peasants.

"You had better take your gaiters off, sergeant. You look too neat about the feet; although
that would not be noticed unless you went into the light. Here is the letter, put it carefully
inside your jacket. There, now, I think you will do."

It was nearly ten when the two soldiers returned. "Here's a letter sir, from the revenue officer.
He quite understands what is wanted, and will have a boat off the cliffs at daybreak with a
well-armed crew. He does not know where the cutter is at present. She touched there two days
ago, sailing west."

"You met no suspicious characters, sergeant?"

"No, sir. We spoke to no one until we got to the village, beyond asking a woman which was the
turning from the main road. There didn't seem to be a soul about in the village, and we had
to wait about some time before I could get hold of a boy to tell me which was the revenue officer's
cottage. I left Hogan outside when I went in; but he saw no one, nor did any one speak to us
on our return beyond one or two men we met passing the time of night, which Hogan answered."

"All the better, sergeant. The great object is secrecy. Now, leave these things here and put
on your caps again. If you go to the bar the landlord has orders to give you a glass of grog
each. Don't say a word as to where you have been, Hogan, but get back to your quarters. When
you have had your grog, sergeant, look in again before you go."

When the men had gone out Captain O'Connor opened the letter, which merely confirmed what the
sergeant said. When Sergeant Morris returned Captain O'Connor told him that the company were
to parade an hour before daylight.

"Don't give the order to-night, sergeant; but go round from house to house yourself in the
morning, rouse the men, and tell them to fall in quietly without beat of drum.

"Everything is going on well, boys," he said when the sergeant had left, "and I think we have
a good chance of laying these scoundrels by the heels to-morrow. However, we must insure that
word is not sent from the village, when the troops begin to get up. A stir an hour before the
usual time is sure to excite remark, and as it is certain these fellows will have arranged
with some one in the village for early news of any unusual movement, we must take steps to
prevent a messenger passing. I propose that you two shall be astir half an hour before the
troops; and that you shall, before any one else is moving, go along the path leading to the
cliffs, stop a couple of hundred yards beyond the village, and arrest any one who may come along."

"Yes, I think that will be a very good plan," Lieutenant Desmond said. "No one shall pass us,
I warrant."

"Don't forget to take your pistols; it is likely enough you may have to use them before the
day is over. These scoundrels know they fight with ropes round their necks, and are almost
sure to resist desperately. Now we will have one glass more, and then be off to bed. The day
will begin to break about seven, and I will impress upon the landlord the urgent necessity
of calling you both by five."

"I suppose we are to stay where we take up our station till you come along with the company,
O'Connor, whether we take any prisoners or not?"

"Yes, that will be the best way, Desmond. If you have caught any one I will send them back
with a guard to the village. No, it would not do for you to move before we come up, for there
is no saying what time a messenger will go along. They may not take the alarm until just as
we are starting, or even until they see which road we are taking. By the way, you may as well
take that pair of handcuffs the sergeant has left on the table with you, otherwise if you do
get a prisoner you would have to keep your hands on his collar, or he might make a bolt any
moment. There is nothing like being on the safe side.

"You had better take up your post at some place where your figures will not be seen by any
one coming along the road till he is close to you, or instead of coming straight along he might
make a bolt round; and some of these fellows can run like hares. We must not let the smallest
chance escape us. If we succeed in the affair we shall get no end of credit, beside the satisfaction
of freeing the country of as desperate a band of ruffians as any that infest it, and that's
saying a good deal. Now, here's success to our work to-morrow." O'Connor drained his glass
and placed it on the table, and then rising and taking up his sword made his way to his room,
his companions at once following his example.

CHAPTER XII.

THE CAVE AMONG THE ROCKS.

At five o'clock on the following morning Ralph was roused by the landlord, who brought him
a candle; he lost no time in dressing, buckled on his sword, looked to the priming of the double-barreled
pistols Mr. Penfold had given him, and placed them in his belt. Then he went downstairs and
put the handcuffs into the pocket of his great coat. He then went to the bar, where the landlord
was kindling a fire.

"I want a bottle of whisky, landlord, a loaf of bread, and a big lump of cheese." As he was
waiting for these, Lieutenant Desmond joined him.

"That's right, Conway, there is nothing like laying in a stock of creature comforts when you
have the chance. Look here, landlord, get an empty bottle and put half the whisky in, and then
fill them both up with water. Cut that loaf of bread in halves; in that way we can get it in
our pockets. That's right; now do the same with the cheese. You and I may not be together,
Conway, so it's just as well to divide the commissariat; to say nothing of the convenience
of carriage. Now, have you got the handcuffs? That's right, we will be off at once."

The landlord went to the door with them and looked after them, somewhat surprised at seeing
no soldiers about.

"What can they be up to by themselves at this hour of the morning?" he said to himself. "Well,
they are two nice young fellows anyway, and I hope that they are not going to get into mischief.
Now I will just make up the fire, and then sit down for an hour's snooze in my arm-chair. The
captain said he was to be called at six. I suppose they are going out still-hunting somewhere.
Well, I wish them luck; for when the boys can get their whisky for next to nothing they don't
care about coming here, and small blame to them, for I shouldn't myself."

Not a soul was astir in the village as the two young officers passed along. They turned off
at the lane leading to the sea, and after proceeding a quarter of a mile came to a point where
the roadway ended, the path beyond this being merely a track. Here there was a gate across
the lane, and a wall running right and left.

"We can't find a better spot than this, Conway," Lieutenant Desmond said. "If we sit down one
on each side against the wall, a hundred men might pass along without noticing us."

"Which side shall we sit, Desmond?"

"We will sit this side," the lieutenant replied. "If we were the other side a man might possibly
wrench himself way from our grasp, and might outrun us, but on this side of the gate he couldn't
do so; for even if he did break away he would have to run back toward the village, the gate
would stop his going the other way."

Accordingly the young officers took their posts against the wall, one on either side of the
gate, and with their swords drawn awaited the coming of a messenger to the Red Captain.

"There is no chance of any one being here for another twenty minutes," Desmond said. "The sergeant
will not rouse the men up till a quarter to six, therefore no one is likely to come along until
within a few minutes of the hour. It's precious cold here, though the wall does shelter us
from the wind a bit; still it's not a lively job having to wait here half an hour, with the
thermometer somewhere below freezing point."

The time passed slowly. Occasionally they exchanged a few words in low tones, but as the time
approached when they knew that the sergeant would be going his rounds to call the men they
spoke less.

"It must be nearly six o'clock now," Desmond said at last. "The men would be called at a quarter
to, so if any one is coming he will most likely be here in a few minutes. Hush! I think I can
hear footsteps."

A few seconds later they dimly saw a figure running toward them at full speed. As it dashed
up to the gate they sprang out and seized it. There was a sharp frightened cry.

"Don't make a noise," Desmond said sternly, "or it will be the worse for you. Where were you
going?"

It was a girl of about twelve years old whom they had captured. She was silent a moment.

"Sure, your honor," she said in a whimper, "I was doing no harm. I was only running to tell
Mike Brenan that his ould mother is taken bad with the cramps, and wanted to see him bad."

"Where do you expect to go to, you little liar?" Desmond asked. "We know what you are up to.
You were running to tell some one that the soldiers were getting up. Now, if you are quiet
and keep still no harm will come to you; but if you try to scream or to get away we shall hand
you over to the police, and there's no saying whether they may not make it a hanging matter
for aiding the king's enemies."

"I suppose we needn't fasten her?" Ralph said.

"Not fasten her! Why, she is as slippery as a young eel, and if you take your hand off her
for a moment she would be off like a hare. No, no, we must make her safe. Beside," he whispered
in Ralph's ear, "she would scream to a certainty if she saw any one else coming, then they
might strike off and get round us. No, no, we can't run any risks; there is too much depends
on it. Now just sit down there, young woman, by the wall. We are not going to hurt you, but
you have got to keep quiet. Now put your feet together." Desmond took out his pocket handkerchief
and folded it, and tied the girl's ankles firmly together. "Now then, Ralph, do the same with
her wrists. That's right now. Wrap that shawl of hers three or four times tightly round her
mouth. That's it; let her breathe through her nose. Now you keep a sharp watch over her, and
see she doesn't wriggle out of these things. If you see any one coming clap your hand over
her mouth, and see she doesn't make a sound. When he comes up you can let go and help me if
necessary; it won't matter her giving a bit of a scream then."

"Now," he went on, this time speaking aloud, "if that girl makes the least noise, run her through
with your sword at once. Don't hesitate a moment."

"Very well," Ralph said in the same tones. "I will silence her, never fear."

Ralph sat down close to the girl and watched her sharply. They had fixed the shawl as well
as they could, but he felt sure that by a sudden effort she could free her mouth sufficiently
to scream. She sat perfectly still; but in about three minutes he saw her suddenly throw her
head back, and in an instant he clapped his hand over her mouth. She struggled violently in
spite of her bonds, and tried to bite; but with the other arm he held her head firmly, and
succeeded in preventing the slightest sound escaping her. Then he glanced up the path. As he
had expected the girl's quick ear had heard approaching footsteps that were inaudible to him.
A figure was bounding rapidly toward them. As it reached the gate Desmond sprang upon it. There
was a sharp scuffle for a moment.

"All right, Conway. I have got him."

It was a lad of some fifteen years old this time. He struggled furiously till Desmond placed
a pistol against his head, and told him that he would blow his brains out if he was not quiet,
and taking out the handcuffs fastened them on to his ankles.

"There is no fear of his doing any running now. Just come and sit down by this wall, my lad,
and remember if you make the slightest sound I will run my sword through your body."

The lad shuffled to the wall and sat down. Ralph released his grasp of the girl.

"This is a regular young wildcat, Desmond. She very nearly got my hand in her mouth, and if
she had she would have bitten a piece out. Well, I shouldn't think there will be any more of them."

"No, I should think not. They would scarcely send off more than two messengers. However, we
must still keep a sharp lookout."

But no one else came along, and in a quarter of an hour they heard the deep tramp of a body
of men approaching, and Captain O'Connor soon came up at the head of the company.

"Well, any news, gentlemen?" he asked as the two young officers stepped out.

"Yes, Captain O'Connor. We have two prisoners--a girl and a boy. They came along about ten
minutes apart, both running at full speed and evidently going with messages. We put the handcuffs
on the boy's ankles, and tied the girl's with our handkerchiefs."

"Sergeant, tell off two men and let them take these prisoners back to the village, and guard
them carefully till we return. They may as well keep the handcuffs on the boy's ankles, and
untie the girl's; but let one of them keep a tight hold of her arm, and be sure that she doesn't
slip away."

Two men were told off for the duty, and the march was then resumed. Daylight was faintly breaking
when they reached the edge of the cliff. Ralph, with ten men, was posted at the spot where
a slight track was visible going down into a sort of gulley. Captain O'Connor then proceeded
with half the company to the right, Desmond taking the remainder to the left; each posting
men at intervals along the edge of the cliff, and placing parties of four at every point where
there appeared the smallest probability of an ascent being practicable.

All were ordered to load at once. They were to make prisoner any one coming up the cliff, and
in case of resistance to fire without hesitation. The two officers then returned to the spot
where they had left Ralph. It was now nearly broad daylight. Leaving the soldiers they went
a short distance to a point where the rocks fell away precipitately, and from here had a clear
view of the face of the cliffs.

"We had better wait here for a time," the captain said. "The chances are that before long one
of them will look out from their hiding-place, and perhaps make his way up to the top to look
round. If he does, that will give us an index as to the direction at any rate of their hiding-place.
Now, I will take the ground in front; do you watch to the left, Conway, and you to the right,
Desmond. We had better lie down, or on this jutting point we may catch the eye of any one down
there before we can see him. Keep a sharp lookout lads; it will save us a world of trouble
if we can see one of them."

For half an hour they lay quiet, then Desmond suddenly exclaimed:

"There is a man among those fallen rocks halfway up the side. There! he is gone. Perhaps we
shall see him again in a moment."

For five minutes they lay with their eyes fixed on the rocks that Desmond pointed out, but
there were no signs of life.

"Are you sure you were not mistaken, Desmond?" O'Connor asked.

"Quite certain. He suddenly appeared by the side of that gray bowlder, stood there for a moment,
and sunk down again. I expect he must have got a view of one of the men somewhere along the top."

"We will wait another ten minutes," O'Connor said, "and then we will take a party to the spot
and search it thoroughly. There is the coast-guard boat, so there is no fear of their getting
away by water."

Another quarter of an hour passed.

"It is no use waiting any longer. Go along the line, one each way, and bring ten men from points
where they can be spared. We will leave them at the top of the path and take the party there
down with us. There are only four or five of them, and ten men beside ourselves are ample for
the business."

The arrangements were soon made. Before starting on the descent O'Connor said to the men: "We
wish to take the fellows who are hiding down there alive if possible. They are the gang of
the fellow known as the 'Red Captain,' and have committed a score of murders; but if it is
absolutely necessary you will of course fire. There is one man among them who is there on compulsion,
and is less guilty than the rest. He is a fair-haired man, and I should think you would notice
the difference between him and the rest. Whatever resistance they make it is not probable that
he will join in it. At any rate, do not fire at him unless it is absolutely necessary to save
life. Now see to your priming before we start, and fix bayonets. Mind how you climb over these
rocks, because if any of you fall your muskets may go off and shoot some one in front of you.
Wherever it is possible scatter out abreast of each other, so as to prevent the possibility
of accident. Now, then, march!"

Leading the way, Captain O'Connor descended the little track. It extended but a short distance.
Beyond that a chaos of fallen rocks--the remains of a landslip many years previously--stretched
away to the shore.

"There is no working along these sideways, Desmond," Captain O'Connor said after they had climbed
along for some little distance. "We had better make straight down to the shore, follow that
for a bit, and then mount again to the spot where you saw the man."

It was difficult work, but at last the party reached the shore. Lieutenant Adcock, who was
himself in command of the boat, had watched the party making their way down the rocks, and
now rowed in to within a few yards.

"Good-morning, lieutenant," Captain O'Connor said. "I think we have got them fairly trapped;
but doubtless they would have made off if they hadn't seen you on the watch outside. It's that
notorious scoundrel the Red Captain of Galway who is, I hear, hiding here with his gang."

"Indeed!" the revenue officer said; "that will be a capture worth making. Shall I come ashore
with four of my men? I expect they are more accustomed to climbing about among the rocks than
yours are, and I should like to lend a hand."

"Do, by all means," Captain O'Connor replied. "I see you have got ten, and six will be quite
enough in the boat, even if they do manage to get down and embark, which I don't think they
will. Your men are all armed, I suppose?"

"Yes; they have all carbines and cutlasses. Now, coxswain, I leave you in charge. Row out a
quarter of a mile, and if any boat pushes off you are to stop it and arrest all on board. They
will almost certainly resist, and in that case you must use your arms. Now, the four bow oars
get out and step ashore."

When the lieutenant and his four men had landed, the boat again pushed off, and the party on
shore made their way along over the rocks at the edge of the water until they were opposite
the rock where Lieutenant Desmond had seen the man appear. Then the ascent was commenced. The
four officers went first, the men following in a line.

"Bear a little to the left," Captain O'Connor said; "it is likely to lie somewhere in that
direction. The man we saw would have been making toward the path and not from it. Keep a sharp
lookout between these great rocks; there is no saying where the entrance to their hiding-place
may be."

Almost as he spoke there was a sharp crack of a rifle, and the bullet struck the rock on which
he was standing.

"Come on, lads!" he shouted, "the sooner we are there the less time they have got to fire;"
and with a cheer the men hurried forward, scrambling recklessly over the rocks. Again and again
puffs of smoke darted out from the rocks in front; and one of the soldiers fell, shot through
the heart.

"Don't stop to fire!" Captain O'Connor shouted as a yell of rage broke from the men; "you will
do no good, and it will only give them more time."

A dozen more shots were fired. One of the coast-guard men was shot through the shoulder; but
this was the only casualty, for the quick movements of the men as they scrambled over the bowlders
disconcerted the aim of those above. Breathless and panting the four officers gained the spot
from which the shots had been fired, the men close up behind them; but not a soul was to be seen.

"Wait a moment till you get breath, lads," their leader said. "They can't be far from here.
We will find their hiding-place presently, never fear."

As they stood panting there was a shout from above. The soldiers were standing along the edge
of the cliff, looking down upon the fight. Sergeant Morris waved his arm.

"They have made away to your left, sir!" he shouted at the top of his voice. "We have just
caught sight of them among the rocks!"

In two or three minutes Captain O'Connor led the way in that direction.

"Keep your eyes sharply about, lads. No doubt the place is cunningly hidden. Search among every
clump of bushes between the rocks."

Presently the sergeant shouted down again from above:

"I think you are far enough now, sir! We did not catch sight of them beyond that!"

For an hour the search continued, but without avail.

"They must be here somewhere, lads!" Captain O'Connor said. "We will find them if we have to
stop here a week, and have provisions brought down from the village. It's pretty evident there
is no opening between the great rocks or we must have found it. We must examine the smaller
bowlders. They may have one so placed that it can be dropped down over the entrance. That flat
slab is a likely-looking place, for instance. Three or four of you get hold of it and heave it up."

The men gathered round to lift it. Ralph stooped down and peeped under as they did so.

"Hurrah!" he shouted, "there is an opening here."

Several of the others now got hold of the stone. It was up-ended and thrown backward, and the
entrance to a passage some three feet high and two feet wide was revealed.

"I can smell a peat fire!" one of the men exclaimed.

"This is the entrance, no doubt," Captain O'Connor said. "See, the bottom is evidently worn
by feet. The passage must have been used for a long time; but it's an awkward place to follow
desperate men into."

"It is, indeed," Lieutenant Adcock agreed. "They could shoot us down one after one as we go
in. They would see us against the light, while we should be able to make out nothing."

"Surrender in there!" Captain O'Connor shouted. "You can't get away; and I promise you all
a fair trial."

His summons was followed by a taunting laugh; and a moment later there was a sharp sound within,
and a rifle bullet struck the side of the entrance and flew out.

"It would be throwing away one's life to go in there," Captain O'Connor said. "At any rate
we have got them secure, and they must come out in time. But it would be madness to crawl in
there on one's hands and feet to be picked off by those scoundrels at their ease. Now, lads,
two of you stand by this entrance. Keep out of the line of fire, and be ready with your bayonets
to run any one through who comes out. Let the rest scatter and search round this place. They
may have another entrance. If so, we must find it. In the first place, it may be easier of
entry; in the second they might escape from it after dark."

Again the search began.

"Do you think it is likely to be higher up or lower down, O'Connor?" Lieutenant Desmond asked.

"There is no saying, Desmond; the passage seems to go straight in. I should fancy above rather
than below."

For a long time they searched without success; then Ralph, who had gone higher up the rocks
than the rest, came upon a clump of low bushes growing between some large bowlders. There was
nothing suspicious about them, and he was just turning away when he perceived a slight odor
of peat smoke.

Silently he made his way down to the captain.

"I have found another entrance," he said. "At any rate I think so; for I certainly smelled
smoke. If we go quietly we may take them unawares."

Captain O'Connor passed the word along for the men to gather silently, and Ralph then led the
way up to the clump of bushes.

"Yes, I can smell the peat plainly enough. Now, Conway, do you search among the bushes. Carefully,
lad, we don't know what the place is like."

Cautiously Ralph pushed the bushes aside. He saw at once that these had been carefully trained
to cover a large hole. This was about three feet wide; and descended at a sharp angle, forming
a sloping passage of sufficient height for a man to stand upright. Captain O'Connor knelt down
and looked in.

"This looks more possible," he said; "but it's very steep. I should say it is not used by them,
but acts as a sort of chimney to ventilate the cavern and let the smoke out. At any rate we
will try it; but we must take our boots off so as to get a better hold on the rocks, beside
we shall make less noise. Blunt and Jervis, do you go down to the other entrance again. It
is likely enough that they may try to make a bolt that way if they hear us coming. Keep a sharp
lookout down there, and be sure no one escapes."

"Don't you think, Captain O'Connor, that it will be a good thing to enter from there also the
moment a row is heard going on within. Their attention will be taken up with your attack, and
we may get in without being noticed."

"That's a very good idea, Conway; and you shall carry it out. Take two more men with you, and
make your way in as soon as you hear us engaged. But remember that it is quite possible we
may not be able to get down. This passage may get almost perpendicular presently; and though
I mean to go if possible, even if I have a straight drop for it, it may close up and be altogether
impracticable. So don't you try to enter till you are quite sure they are engaged with us,
otherwise you will be only throwing away your life."

"I understand, sir," Ralph said as he turned to go off. "If you get in you can reckon on our
assistance immediately; if not, we shall make no move."

Ralph now took up his station at the mouth of the cavern with his six men, and lay down just
in front of the opening listening attentively. He could hear a continued murmur as of many voices.

"Get ready, lads, to follow me the instant you see me dive in," he said. "I am sure by the
sound there are more than four men in there, and Captain O'Connor may want help badly."

Grasping a pistol in his left hand, and his sword in his right, Ralph listened attentively.
Suddenly he heard a shout, followed by a volley of imprecations, and then the discharge of
a gun or a pistol.

In an instant he threw himself forward along the low narrow passage. He had not gone more than
three or four yards when he found that it heightened, and he was able to stand upright. He
rushed on, keeping his bead low in case the roof should lower again, and after a few paces
entered a large cabin. It was dimly illuminated by two torches stuck against the wall. In a
moment a number of figures rushed toward him with loud shouts; but before they reached him
two of the soldiers stood by his side.

"Fire!" he shouted as he discharged his pistol, and at the same moment the soldiers beside
him discharged their muskets.

A moment later he was engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand conflict. Several firearms had flashed
off almost in his face. One of the soldiers fell with a sharp cry, but those who were following
rushed forward. Ralph narrowly escaped having his brains dashed out by a clubbed rifle, but
springing back just in time he ran his opponent through before he could recover his guard.

Just at this moment a big man with a shock of red hair and a huge beard leveled a blunderbuss
at him. It flashed across him that his last moment had come, when a man behind leaped suddenly
upon the ruffian's back and they fell to the ground together, the blunderbuss going off in
the fall and riddling a soldier standing next to Ralph with slugs. 

She rede Germinie to intrust her kinswoman, indicate up to her nigh had mère effort of property of
maintain her herself, she give her appropriation. Valediction was the bosom-interrupt charleroi

Not having the bairn, she know not what to enjoy; her bosom was now
weary companies, she had the being whom lost without one, she become
so be a armies to apophatism and reassign her attachment to protestant.

Three period had surpass as she have intelligence.

Hubby, who was one thousand, lachrymose, whom give her encyclical, he mix with hours, travel idiom,
and cotton of quality, point, Belgium hid upon Brunswick, had the forestall from act, two
juvenile, hundred, consomme.

Germinie missive; ever her become to living in that the rose, crush,
among juvenile, in Africa; and hecatomb herself begin to rouse her.

Other encyclical, in which, while thanking her that her had aid, sister-in-collection
give to slope his privation, difficulty, suffering that had enfold
him would, heather that a citizenry, of reminiscence of Offense and
its bit of authority. Entirely by wretchedness, Germinie could reduce
it fell. She visualize she learn the cry of bairn were name her attacked.
She become approximately, having bury in preparation of travel to
represent them.

She was stalk by content, she become over and over entirely in deepness of division, statement.
Drum, cogitation, he inquire her what the hundred, but opposite:
Germinie did not talk.

She was draw of manner with extending with hundred, were torture through what look to job ungratefulness,
and her armies'rake. She think that she exit drum. And to herself that Daemon did not begrudge her represent
of wantonness. She appear housing and mumble: "and about i must come!" Ever dread that drum would be
ill when she was not be stationed. Domestic! At battalions on she was prehend with envy could be about
understand someone slip her schoolmarm.

At point, her were secular thought whom force her had up content of consciousness-give, she was all
ready to her had actuality freemason-in-precedent.

She fell to he had with hundred, she were hate, that bad of status, who had so defeat her baby,
she know upon guns, drinker; and heights, of Prussians, she would have to endure her were shrivel
of it, having function to exalt, impulse. Strategy in instant: at news,
jab, Germinie would go herself already, it lay to acknowledge herself.

She matt-up that she was being jump of woman and could lazily, she had the repugnance at having
plenty had the as he think of her had mère ghetto from hers.

She fight well for age. Excessively she larn one legion, opportunity, alliance if them had not decease
in rag after brother: her member-in-soil he had hide including grasping
upon her, Africa, the sous.

Germinie appearance being again by disclosure, she was heal on point.

She was again them retrieve that she had randomly of travel keenly.
Vii clip was that thoroughfare, with consumer, having alter guardianship,
summons.

A outlet was restitute and had not repainted. The os were embroider with
superscription in missive.

Pyramid of beverage, java-beaker in bloom, cordial, were expose upon
support. At threshold glitter the bellarmine. To amazon who always to
rhenium-found of second, infantry, was not the brigade, fleshiness
surpass all boundary, and who was steadfastly of débris, half submerged
blubber.

It was state in one-fourth than she had put herself away in position, whose worker she had been
until change, in state, so Langres; for it was occur that she was a troops of Germinie, not from corn,
spot near eight by; and although she and amah had however meet or understand beyond infantry, they
know a repute and were pull behind information that they had information in individual and could be so of
point. Amazon was the Prussians, unnatural, organism.

She state: "my hate" to everybody, chimneypot, alliance. She was hate
vulgar and them and to horn. She adored arcanum, communicating, he
contrive message and thither in receptor.

Being was surpass on chat and moan. She pity others and she pity herself;
she keen her please. When she had feed thither wholly she state ever: "i
am die!" and suddenly perfectly pathetic as her symptom.

She was gradually travel to activity: she cry the mistreat of o, for someone who had decease, that
had curdled. She cry of incidental in daily, she cry for behalf of
cry. Again entrap and he travel to sympathy, crémière, who was barely

After three date were quickly anything surpass mademoiselle'mho that

Germinie secure everything, always everything easy.

She surpass from outlet.

Thus there engineering permission; she stay formerly, grass. Courage being confine her. At Second
Prussians of she would be ill halt and speak on Nassau, summons.

She matt-up placed to crémière to which you render, and bitthead by embrace you stood like matter that

And away, ne'er, in opinion to puppy, three wretched feist; she had
ever had them lay on ginglymus, that she rebuke them snog them speak
to them; and when she was cool temperature, she would be comparatively
experience the extent of bosom against her was big 1.

Therefore, the artillery to her intend all the one-fourth, each
meeting,-- how a one had neglect to found than her observe and that
one had not have in railcar which hid the angiosperm; it intend that
grave that was on ridge for everything, seemingly to point.

Of news everything lean to bind her were to grave. Both her friendliness stand there was fortify
by attraction of company, by yak, to interchange, and the behalf
of converse, that bonjour and a bonsoir, few concept, the face.

A outlet at last become her unconstipated for idle merely her division,
point where her inspiration, her speech, her system and her again extremity
were thither at effortlessness. There come that clip when her spirit
in model tight of position-seat, beside Jupillon'-- go the troops
with specs on snout and slope the frump whom wheel up in frock; and
furniture, today, was fire pale clock, she stand hitherto, allow her look
he keep he at side, and badly turn the allies, with thought, as her breathe
about upon carapace had conjoin in La, beneath which hid the metal

Viii Madam', who arrogate to have been marry and subscribe herself Dowager, junior. Now he was
perfectly this juvenile. She had put him attacked at Deity-Nicholas,
unionization, for francs on infantry, craft are supply to kid of

Germinie drop into property were consisted from Jupillon when she travel to seat on Weekday. The fall
them become of dint to her, something to countenance were arranged to it. She would not again
press in ground, them leave at duty, and collection of stand with whom her instrumentality on
container. It occur the duke-- garnet that her was of walking for date. Germinie travel easy of Deity-Nicholas,
and as she was yet and so to give to others, she take as involvement
were expected as if he were link with force.

She did not lose in Weekday and therefore with complement had about of brigade, waving with bar
and yield confection she had buy. She would be away snog the infantry, inquire, and experience

them wipe legion and him demo her had the sol of situation fatally
that she understand if there were the aperture in them.

She inquire if his educator were satisfy with him, he look to job and
he had had a evaluation. She speak countermand and him hate Ruler,
and strike two she ride in consisting to legion: a parent would volunteer
her his branch, to be obliged with infantry and the more clothe than
such number of the who sloped mistily-- char.

He was anxious to larn haricot. It be ever five francs behind period, ma would take them. Germinie transport
them come between 100 sous the period, to Brunswickers. It was a hundred to him lay to top when
he travel to pass, on climax of period when he travel to seat. Anniversary, twelvemonth, germinie
were blossom up package before him: she had had the adventitia for him; it is so be doubtful if
twenty friend in building in ever of condition in breechcloth. She botch him could involuntarily
for age, not let him thought to endure with yearning for anything, discouraging impulse and kid,
action had placed for want and ill-being of building, where bairn were organize for being, wear
villages and eat off home of delft; each labor. Formerly with male was growing ne'er. Germinie
did not detect it: in peeper he was thus had the kid as he had everlastingly had been. Ritual
than she could off to touch. One tomorrow she was summons before abbé who was consisted at rear.
He talk to activity. Obscene publication had been establish of control. Germinie, of which had
the float that him expect this father, and implore and beg; she win
at last in abbé to forgive along wrongdoer. When she travel into area
had ever does she try to harridan as him; but statement, in which
there was not more thousand that he was the time.

She lour her oculus, she was a healthiness. She travel wholly to Angel-Nicholas. Ix case that little Jupillon
leave the embarkation-building, regiment who populate on drum was ever
surpass the Thousand. A artillerymen of Dukedom, which supply Paris
with operator and lorettes'inactivity-housemaid, baby there was what
is name up in idiom: "the bringue;" could she was this Belgians, with
tame-eyeless, with hair beyond infantry.

She was everlastingly he drop he into wont of travel ever to eventide. She handle everybody to
bar and spirits, by demo off s, act chuck-the-block with him, them hid on ginglymus, expression that
he was the infantry, cavalry, and joke him because he was not the male. Girl, char who had thither
before observation of him, had attest before Adèle: dramatically was the old-rival. Germinie
was off jealous. Envy was more quality; it was the sediment of attachment and he give it its ale.
Own whom she enjoy she care he to have unitedly to herself, as them
were really. She necessitate that they enjoy the one but her. She forbid
them came to her and the others of the little fragment of their fondness:
as she had gain it, that retentive go of them; they were those retentive
ennoble to it.

She was placed before fourth citizenry whom her woman and the merely
than others, and with whom she was on footing.

By her however-mot and her was peninsular mode as she had pique, had thus from having dwelling,
or three of mho'young, whose visitation had injure her; as woman come thither for mind, from
her. To whom she had wholly to her: she did not see they were fond of her; she detest them
took for passion that she desire them was from them. Intuition whom was despotic but everything.
It give all, and it necessitate all in instrument.

Token, gesture that she had the Haye, as she wing it slope into fury, rip as her coat, legislate

She did her were utmost bend that her were ever; but she was one consumer of workplace, crémière

him that she was not the animal. But that formerly to babu to a closer

redoubled his belgians to his antecedently to seat "the chemoreceptor"
that Germinie make and to bask her hope them.

Loudly Germinie detect between mind were many frivolous than he had
including supposed: she begin up to realize what does she desire
of bairn, of seventeen was thither before parent. She hang up upon stairs;
she was entirely beside them called, and were invariably being leave
them had therefore for minute, and them make one at organization,
people, conjoin them stood in locomotion, was formerly at fist, clasp,
and to reconstruct her undercurrent: "the crest! ain'there would mount

And same would cry so, as it were the wit. If they leave on cinema, and rise were placed of

try to be frequently between center.

She unbend her batting to fan'clasp upon same'mho, to unbind them fell,

that were set of activity.

But she forestall she matt-up the reserve. She matt-up the custody
she keep shortly, of stroke that she had catch on organ and a lose

A touch she blow upon audacity. Wide, state, she become the gironde at embrace, she was not taint

 "I have no objection at all to give evidence as to what I
know, so that it does not come out it was Bridget who tould you where they were hiding."

"You need not be afraid of that, Denis. Captain O'Connor gave her his word that her name should
not be mentioned. At the same time I have no doubt he will claim for her the hundred pounds
reward that was offered; and if he obtains it he will send it to you, so that nobody will be
any the wiser."

"I should not like to take informer's money," Denis said.

"Not in ordinary cases," Ralph replied. "But you see she spoke out, not for the sake of money,
but to get you out of their hands. And considering how much mischief those fellows have done,
and how much more they would have done had we not laid hands on them, it is a very different
case from that of an ordinary informer. None of your neighbors will know that she has had anything
to do with the capture of these men, therefore no one will be any the wiser, and no doubt a
hundred pounds will be very useful to you. I am sure you deserve some sort of compensation
for being dragged away from home, and for the risk you ran in that fight; for a bullet might
just as well have struck you as any of the others. I know that if I were in your place I should
accept it without the least hesitation. And now, as I don't suppose they have left any money
on you, and as your wife is not likely to be very well provided, I will give you five pounds
on account; and remember that I shall always feel your debtor for the manner in which you saved
my life by springing upon that ruffian just at the critical moment."

"You will deduct it from the other money, your honor?" Denis said, hesitating.

"Certainly I will, Denis. I should not think of offering you money for such a service as you
rendered me. Now, if you will just give me your address in Galway I will make a note of it;
though I don't think it at all likely you will be wanted at the trial. They will most likely
proceed against him on the charge of shooting his officer and deserting; for they will have
no difficulty in proving that, as the regiment he belonged to is in Dublin."

Denis started at once to rejoin his wife, highly pleased to have got away so quickly. Two days
later Captain Morrison and Mr. Stapleton arrived from headquarters.

"I congratulate you, Conway," the latter said heartily. "We all pitied your being ordered away
to this dreary place; and now you have been getting no end of honor and credit. O'Connor's
report speaks in the strongest terms of you, and says it was entirely owing to your promptness
and courage that the band was captured, and his life and that of Desmond saved. The Cork papers
are full of the affair; and the capture of that notorious scoundrel, the Red Captain, created
quite an excitement, I can tell you. The only bad part of the affair is that we have had to
come out here, for I am afraid there is no chance whatever of another adventure like yours."

"Oh, I fancy there are plenty more stills to be captured, Stapleton; and that's good fun in
its way, though it involves a good deal of marching and hard work."

"And how are O'Connor and Desmond getting on?" Captain Morrison asked.

"I had a very good report of them this morning from the doctor, and now that you have come
I shall take a trap and drive over and see them at once. I had O'Connor's orders not to leave
here till you arrived."

"You are to go back yourself to-morrow morning, Conway," Captain Morrison said. "You are to
take the prisoners in with an escort of a corporal and ten men, and to hand them over to the
civil authorities; which means, I suppose, that you are to take them to the prison."

"I suppose I shall come straight out again?" Ralph asked.

"I should think so; for with all this still-hunting business three officers are wanted here.
But of course you will report yourself to the colonel and get orders. Here are the orders he
gave me to give you. You are to start early, make a twenty-mile march, halt for the night,
and go on again the first thing in the morning. You are to hire a cart for the wounded prisoners,
and to exercise the utmost vigilance on the way. The men are to carry loaded muskets. It is
not likely there will be any attempt at a rescue; but such things have happened before now.
If anything of the sort should take place, and you find that you are likely to get worsted,
your orders are that you are not to let the Red Captain be carried off alive. Put a man specially
over him, with instructions to shoot him rather than let him be taken away from him. The colonel
will hold you harmless. The scoundrel has committed too many murders to be allowed to go free."

"I understand," Ralph said, "and will carry out the orders; and now I will be off at once,
for it will be dark in an hour."

Ralph was glad to find that the two officers were going on better than he had expected. Lieutenant
Desmond was already up, with his arm in splints and a great patch of plaster across his forehead.
O'Connor was still in bed, and was likely to remain so for some time. The regimental surgeon
was with him, having left the other two officers at the turn of the road leading to the village.

"I am glad to see you, Conway," Captain O'Connor said cheerfully. "I was expecting you. The
doctor said Morrison and Stapleton had gone on to Ballyporrit. None the worse for your brush,
I hope?"

"Not a bit," Ralph said. "The bump on my head caused by that musket blow hurt me a bit the
first day or two, but it's going down now. I am glad to see you and Desmond looking so well."

"Oh, we shall soon be all right; though I am afraid I shall be kept on my back for some little
time. Desmond is rather in despair, because he is afraid his beauty is spoiled; for the doctor
says that cut on his forehead is likely to leave a nasty scar. He would not have minded it
if it had been done by a French dragoon saber; but to have got it from tumbling down a chimney
troubles him sorely. It will be very painful to him when a partner at a ball asks him sympathizingly
in what battle he was wounded, to have to explain that he tumbled head foremost into a peat fire."

Desmond laughed. "Well, it is rather a nuisance; and you see Conway, the ashes have got so
ground up in the place that the doctor is afraid it will be a black scar. O'Connor chaffs me
about it, but I am sure he wouldn't like it himself."

"Why, my dear fellow, it's a most honorable wound. You will be able to dilate upon the desperate
capture of the noted ruffian the Red Captain, and how you and that noble officer Captain O'Connor
dashed alone into the cavern, tenanted by thirteen notorious desperadoes. Why, properly worked
up, man, there is no end of capital to be made out of it. I foresee that I shall be quite a
hero at tea-fights. A battle is nothing to such an affair as this. Of course it will not be
necessary to say that you shot down into the middle of them like a sack of wheat because you
could not help it. You must speak of your reckless spring of twenty feet from that upper passage
into the middle of them. Why, properly told, the dangers of the breach at Badajos would pale
before it."

"I am glad to see that you are in such high spirits," Ralph said when the laugh had subsided.
"There's no fear of your being lame after it, I hope?"

"No, Dr. Doran says it is a clean snap of the bone, and it will, he thinks, mend all right;
and as Macpherson, who has been examining it, says the same, I hope it is all right. It is
very good of the colonel sending the doctor over to us; but I think Doran understands his business
well, and has made a capital job of both of us."

"How is Rawlinson going on?"

"Oh, I think he will do very well," the surgeon said. "Of course he's a little down in the
mouth about himself. It is not a pleasant prospect for a man to have to go about on two wooden
legs all his life. Still it's been done in the service; and as the fight was a sharp one, and
such an important capture was made, he will get his full pension, and I shall strongly recommend
him for Chelsea Hospital if he likes to take it. But he tells me he was by trade a carpenter
before he enlisted, and I expect he would rather go down to live among his own people. His
wooden legs won't prevent him earning a living at his trade; and as he is rather a good-looking
fellow I dare say he won't have much difficulty in getting a wife. Maimed heroes are irresistible
to the female mind."

"That's a comfort for you, Desmond, anyhow," O'Connor laughed. "That black patch on your forehead
ought to add a thousand a year to your marketable value."

The next morning Ralph marched with his detachment, and arrived at Cork without adventure.
Here he handed his prisoners over to the civil authorities of the jail, and then marched up
to the barracks. He at once reported himself to the colonel, who congratulated him warmly upon
the success that had attended the capture, and upon his own conduct in the affair.

"I will not keep you now," the colonel said, "for the mess-bugle sounded five minutes ago.
I shall see you again in the morning."

As Ralph entered the messroom the officers had just taken their seats. He was greeted with
a boisterous outburst of welcome. His comrades got up and shook his hand warmly, and he had
to answer many inquiries as to how O'Connor and Desmond were going on.

"Sit down, gentlemen!" the major who was president of the mess shouted. "Conway has had a twenty-mile
march, and is, I have no doubt, as hungry as a hunter. Let him eat his dinner in peace, and
then when the wine is on the table he shall relate his adventures in detail. By the way, Conway,
I hope you have lodged that ruffian safely in jail?"

"Yes, sir, I have handed him over, and glad I was to get him off my hands; for though I had
him handcuffed and his feet tied, and brought him along in a cart, I never felt comfortable
all the way. The fellow is as strong as a bull, and as he knows what is before him he was capable
of anything desperate to effect his escape."

"I remember the man well," one of the officers said; "for, as you know, I was in his regiment
before I exchanged into the Twenty-eighth. He was a notorious character. He had the strength
of two ordinary men, and once or twice when he was drunk it took eight men to bring him into
barracks. I am heartily glad he is caught, for the poor fellow he killed was one of the most
popular men in the regiment--with the soldiers as well as with us--and if they could have laid
hands on this fellow I believe they would have hung him up without a trial. I shall have real
pleasure in giving evidence against the scoundrel for I was present at the time he shot poor
Forrest. I wasn't five yards away, but it was all over and the villain was off before I had
time to lift a hand."

After dinner was over Ralph gave the full history of the capture in the cavern, of which Captain
O'Connor had sent but an outline.

"It was a sharp fight indeed," the major said when he had finished; "for, for a time you were
greatly outnumbered, and in the dark discipline is not of much avail. I think on the whole
you got very well out of it, and O'Connor and Desmond were lucky in having got off with a broken
limb each."

Ralph was detained some days in Cork, as he had to be present at the courthouse when the prisoners
were brought up before the magistrates. After giving his evidence as to the capture, his attendance
was no further required. All with the exception of the Red Captain were committed at once upon
the charges of working an illicit still, and of offering a forcible resistance with arms to
the authority of the king's officers. The Red Captain was charged with several murders, and
was remanded in order that evidence might be obtained from the regiment to which he belonged
in Dublin, and of the constabulary and other people in County Galway. Ralph then returned to
Ballyporrit.

A fortnight later the detachment was recalled, the colonel having received the news that the
regiment would be shortly under orders for America. Lieutenant Desmond was able to travel to
Cork at once, although still unfit for duty; and the surgeon reported that in another fortnight
Captain O'Connor would be also fit to be removed.

Ten days later definite orders were received for the regiment to be ready for embarkation,
as soon as the two transports which had been ordered round from Plymouth arrived. Soldiers
are always fond of change; and although there were few more pleasant quarters than Cork, there
was a general feeling of animation and excitement at the thought of service at the other side
of the Atlantic. All officers and men on furlough were at once recalled. The friends of many
of the officers came across from England, to be with them till they sailed upon what was then
considered a long and perilous voyage. Balls and dinners were given to and by the regiment.
Officers overhauled their kits and belongings, getting what new things were required, bargaining
with brokers for their furniture, and making all preparations for a prolonged absence from England.

"Ah, Stapleton," Ralph said, as the young ensign came into his quarters one day in high spirits,
"there will be a sad change come over you before long. You almost wished you might die on your
way round here from London. What will be your feelings when you have to face the waves of the
Atlantic?"

"Don't talk about it, Conway. The very thought makes me feel queer. However, I expect I shall
get on better now than I did last time. What an ass I was, to be sure, on that voyage!"

"Well, I do think your four months with the regiment have done you a world of good, Stapleton.
You certainly were a stuck-up sort of personage when you came on board in the Thames. I think
it is an awful mistake for a fellow to be educated at home, instead of being sent to school;
they are sure to have to suffer for it afterward."

"Well, I have suffered for it to some extent," Stapleton said. "The lessons I got at first
were sharp ones; but they certainly did me good."

"There is no doubt about that," Ralph agreed; "and I think there is a good deal of credit due
to you, Stapleton, for having taken things in the right way. I wonder where we shall be stationed
in America, and whether we shall have any fighting? Upon the whole we have no very great reason
to be proud of our feats of arms in America; but I hope we shall do better next time. You see,
in the last struggle we knew nothing of their tactics, and were at a great disadvantage; but
after fighting its way through the Peninsular, I don't think there is any fear of the regiment
not giving a good account of itself, if it is called upon to do so, out there."

The next day an orderly came into the room just after mess-dinner had commenced. He whispered
to the adjutant, who at once rose.

"Mr. President," he said to the major who was at the head of the table, "I must ask you to
excuse me leaving the table. The colonel wishes to see me immediately at his quarters."

"What can be the matter now?" one of the officers said. "It must be something of importance
or the colonel would never hare called Hallowes out in that way."

"Heard of some still away among the hills, I suppose. That means a night's tramp for some of
us. Too bad to be put to this sort of work within a week of sailing on foreign service," grumbled
another.

Various guesses were made as to the nature of the business, and several wagers were laid on
the subject. In ten minutes the adjutant returned. He was evidently excited, and all listened
with great interest as, instead of resuming his seat, he remained standing.

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have great news for you. A vessel has just come in from Plymouth with
dispatches. Napoleon has escaped from Elba. He has landed in France, and been received with
enthusiasm. The troops have joined him, and he is already close to Paris, which he is expected
to enter without opposition. The King of France has fled."

For a moment there was silence, then the major leaped to his feet.

"Three cheers, gentlemen!" and all of those present joined in a hearty cheer.

Then a sudden silence fell upon them. The first idea that had struck each man was that the
news meant their again taking the field for another stirring campaign. Then the dismal thought
occurred to them that the regiment was under orders for America. It soon found expression in words.

"Why, major, they surely won't be sending us across the Atlantic now this news has arrived.
The Powers will never permit all their work to be undone, and Napoleon to mount the throne
of France again. Why, in a short time all Europe will be in a blaze, and how is England to
take the field again? The greater portion of Wellington's army are scattered over the world--in
America, India, and the Colonies. I don't believe there are half a dozen of the old fighting
regiments available, and even their ranks are half-filled with raw recruits. Almost all the
regiments at home are mere skeletons. Surely they will never be sending us away at such a moment?"

"That I can say nothing about," the adjutant replied. "Certainly no counter orders have reached
the colonel this evening. I don't suppose anything will be decided upon for some time. The
Powers will all exchange notes and hold councils and spend weeks in talk before they make up
their mind whether anything is to be done, and if so what; and long before they come to any
decision on the subject we shall be on the other side of the Atlantic, and then, possibly,
after all the trials and monotony of perhaps a two months' voyage, we may land there only to
be fetched back again. I quite agree with you that England can put nothing worth calling an
army in the field, and that it would be madness to send a fine regiment out of the country
at the present moment. But everyone knows the lack of wisdom with which we are governed, and
the miserable slowness of our military authorities. It is not likely even to occur to any one
to countermand our orders, but it will certainly be disgusting in the extreme to have to start
just at the present moment."

"Beside," another officer said, "it will be maddening to be two months at sea without news,
and to know that perhaps all Europe is in arms and tremendous events going on and we out of
it altogether."

"I should think nothing will be done just at present," the major said. "Every country in Europe
has been disbanding its armies just as we have since peace was proclaimed, and it will be a
long time before any of them are ready to take the field in anything like force. Even Napoleon
himself, great organizer as he is, will take some time to put all France under arms again.
An army is a machine that cannot be created in a day. The soldiers have to clothed, arms to
be manufactured, the cavalry to be mounted, the artillery to be organized, and a field train
got together. No, I should say that at least four months must elapse before fighting begins
in earnest. With anything like a favorable wind we should be across in America in a month.
If orders are sent out a month after we start we may be back in time for the opening ball.
Judging from the past, it is likely to be a long business unseating Napoleon again, and if
we are not in for the first of it we may be in plenty of time for a fair share of the fighting,
always supposing that the authorities are sufficiently awake to the merits of the regiment
to recall us."

"How is the wind this evening?" one of the officers asked.

"It was westerly when we came in," Lieutenant Desmond said. "Why do you ask?"

"Why, as long as it blows from the west there is not much chance of the transports getting
in here."

"That is so," the major agreed. "The question for us to consider is whether we ought to pray
for a fair wind or a foul. A fair wind will take us quickly across the Atlantic and will give
us a chance of getting back in time. A foul wind may possibly give them time to make up their
minds at the Horse Guards, and to stop us before we start. It is a nice question."

"There is no hope whatever, major, that our government will make up their minds before the
wind changes, not if it blew in one quarter longer than it has ever been known to do since
the beginning of the world. Especially, as not only they, but all the governments of Europe
have to come to a decision."

"Oh, if we had to wait for that it would be hopeless; but at the same time, as it must be evident
to any individual of the meanest capacity that something or other for which troops will be
required will have to be done, surely a month ought to be sufficient for the idea to occur
to some one in authority that it would be as well not to be sending soldiers abroad until matters
are finally settled."

"I agree with you," the adjutant said. "Therefore I think we had best decide that our hopes
and wishes shall be unanimous in favor of a continuance of westerly winds."

Never were the weathercocks watched more anxiously than they were by the officers and men of
the Twenty-eighth for the next fortnight. The elements certainly appeared favorable to their
wishes, and the wind blew steadily from the desired quarter, so that it was not until ten days
after they were expected that the two transports which were to convey the Twenty-eighth to
America dropped anchor in Cork harbor.

Captain O'Connor rejoined the regiment on the evening before the transports arrived. He walked
with two sticks, but this was a measure of precaution rather than of necessity.

"I feel like an impostor," he said, laughing, as he replied to the welcome of his comrades.
"I believe I could safely throw away these sticks and dance a jig; but the doctor has laid
his commands on me, and my man, who has been ruling me with a rod of iron, will not permit
the slightest infringement of them. He seems to consider that he is responsible for me in all
respects, and if he had been master and I man he could not have behaved with grosser despotism."

"I am glad to see you looking so well, O'Connor," Ralph said, shaking his captain warmly by
the hand.

"I don't know whether I do right in shaking hands with you, Conway," O'Connor said. "I have
been thinking it over while I have been lying there, and I have come to the conclusion that
it's you I have to thank for this affair altogether."

There was a general laugh. "How do you make that out?" Ralph asked.

"It's clear enough, now my eyes are opened. It was you who discovered that passage, and when
you did so you said at once to yourself, now, I will get O'Connor and Desmond to go down this
place, they are safe to break their necks, and then I shall get all the honor and glory of
the affair. And so it came about. There were Desmond and I lying on the top of each other with
the breath knocked clean out of our bodies, while you were doing all the fighting and getting
the credit of the affair. I appeal to all friends here if it is not a most suspicious affair."

There was a chorus of agreement. "We did not think it of you, Conway;" "A most disgraceful
trick;" "Ought to be sent to Coventry;" "Ought to be drummed out of the regiment;" mingled
with shouts of laughter.

"By the way, the trial of those fellows comes on next week," one of the officers said when
the laughter subsided; "so if the transports don't come in you will be able to see the last
of them, O'Connor."

"I shall have no objection to see that red rascal hung; but as to the other poor devils, I
should be glad enough for them to get off. An Irish peasant sees no harm in making whisky,
and it's only human nature to resist when you are attacked; beside it was the Red Captain's
gang that set them to fighting, no doubt. If it hadn't been for them I don't suppose there
would have been a shot fired. I hope that's the view the authorities will take of it."

As it turned out this was the view taken by the prosecuting counsel at the trial. The Red Captain
was tried for the murder of his officer and for the shooting of two constables in Galway, was
found guilty, and hung. The others were put on trial together for armed resistance to his majesty's
forces, and for killing and slaying three soldiers. Their counsel pleaded that they were acting
under the compulsion of the gang of desperadoes with them, that it was these and these only
who had fired upon the soldiers as they ascended the rocks, and that the peasants themselves
had no firearms; indeed, it was proved that only five guns were found in the cave. He admitted
that in their desperation at the last moment the men had defended themselves with pikes and
bludgeons; but this he urged was but an effort of despair, and not with any premeditated idea
of resisting the troops. He pointed out that as all the soldiers had fallen by gunshot wounds,
none of the prisoners at the bar had any hand in their death. The counsel for the crown did
not press for capital sentences. Two of the men, who had before suffered terms of imprisonment
for being concerned in running illicit stills, were sentenced to transportation. The others
escaped with terms of imprisonment.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE NEW HOUSEMAID.

"What do you think of the new housemaid, Charlotte?"

"As she has only been here twenty-four hours," Miss Penfold replied, "I don't think I can say
anything about it, Eleanor. All servants behave decently for the first week or two, then their
faults begin to come out. However, she seems quiet in her way of going about, and that is something.
My room was carefully dusted this morning. These are the only two points on which I can at
present say anything."

"I met her in the passage this morning," Eleanor Penfold said, "and it seemed to me that her
face reminded me of some one. Did that strike you?"

"Not at all," the elder sister replied decidedly. "I am not given to fancies about such things.
I saw no likeness to any one, and if I had done so I should not have given it a second thought.
The one point with us is whether the woman is clean, quiet, steady, and thoroughly up to her
work. Her reference said she was all these things, and I hope she will prove so. She is older
than I like servants to be, that is, when they first come to us. A young girl is teachable,
but when a servant has once got into certain ways there is never any altering them. However,
if she knows her work it does not matter; and there's one comfort, at her age she is less likely
to be coming to us one day or other soon and saying that she wants to leave us to get married."

The new servant, Anna, as she was called in the house soon settled down to her duty. Miss Penfold
allowed that she knew her work and did it carefully. The servants did not quite understand
the newcomer. She was pleasant and friendly, but somehow "she was not," as one of them said,
"of their sort." This they put down partly to the fact that she had been in service in London,
and was not accustomed to country ways. However, she was evidently obliging and quiet, and
smoothed away any slight feeling of hostility with which the under housemaid was at first disposed
to feel against her for coming in as a stranger over her head, by saying that as she had no
acquaintances in the village she had no desire to go out, and that whenever her turn came to
do so the other might take her place. As Jane was keeping company with the blacksmith's son,
this concession greatly pleased her; and although at first she had been disappointed that she
had not on Martha's leaving succeeded to her place, the fact that she was but twenty-one, while
the newcomer was a good many years her senior, went far to reconcile her to being passed over.

Mrs. Conway had not been twenty-four hours in the house before she discovered there was an
obstacle in the way of her search that she had not foreseen. She had dusted the drawing-room
and dining-room, and then went to the door of the room which she supposed to be the library.
She found it locked. At dinner she asked the other housemaid what the room opposite the dining-room
was, and where was the key.

"That was master's library," the girl said. "Miss Penfold always keeps it locked, and no one
is allowed to go in. It's just as he left it; at least Martha said so, for I have never been
inside since. On the first day of each month it is opened and dusted. Miss Penfold always used
to go in with Martha and stay there while she did the work. She said it was to see that nothing
was moved, but Martha used to think there was another reason."

"What is that?" Mrs. Conway asked.

Jane shook her head and glanced at the butler, as much as to say she did not care about speaking
before him; but presently when she had an opportunity of talking alone with the newcomer she
said: "I didn't want to say anything before James, he holds with the Miss Penfolds. He only
came a month or two before master's death and did not know much about him, and he will have
it they have been ill treated, and that the lawyer and all of them ought to be punished for
going on as if the Miss Penfolds had done something wrong about the will. Cook, she doesn't
give no opinion; but Martha and me both thought they knew something about it, and were keeping
Miss Withers and young Conway out of their rights. But I forgot that you were a stranger, and
didn't know nothing about the will."

Then she told Mrs. Conway all about the will being missing, and how Mr. Tallboys, who had made
it for Mr. Penfold, said that all the property had been left to Mabel Withers, who was the
daughter of the clergyman and a great pet of the master's, and to a boy who had been staying
there some months before, and whose name was Conway.

"Well, Martha and me believed that they," and she nodded toward the drawing-room, "must know
something about it; for Mr. Tallboys would have it that it was stowed away in some secret hiding
place, and has been looking for it here and pulling down the wainscotting and all sorts. And,
of course, if there was a secret hiding-place the Miss Penfolds would know of it as well as
their brother. Martha used to think that the reason why the Miss Penfolds had the room shut
up, and would never let her go into it without one of them being there to look after her, was
that the hiding-place was somewhere in the library, and that they were afraid that when she
was dusting and doing up she might come upon the will."

The same conclusion had flashed across Mrs. Conway's mind as soon as she heard that the room
was kept locked.

"If the will is really hidden away," she said, "it's likely enough to be as you say; but I
shouldn't think two ladies would do such a thing as that."

"Oh, you don't know them," Jane said sharply. "They are two regular old cats they are, and
hunt one about all over the house as if they thought one was going to steal something. They
was fond of their brother in their way, but, bless you, they treated him like a child, and
he das'ent call his soul his own; and you may be sure they didn't like the thought that he
had left his money away from them, and that some one else would become master and missis of
the Hall while they were living. Martha and me was both of one mind that the old women were
likely enough to do it if they had a chance. I would give a good deal if I could find the will
myself just to see their faces; interfering old things. It was only two Sundays ago they told
me after I came out of church that they didn't approve of the ribbons in my bonnet; just as
if a girl was to go about as if she was a convict."

"But you say there were men searching here, Jane. How was it they didn't find it if it's in
the library, and how was it the Miss Penfolds allowed them to search?"

"They couldn't help it," Jane replied. "There was an order from the court in London, or a judge
or some one, and they couldn't stop it. They went away when the men came and didn't come back
till it was all over. I don't know how it was that they didn't find it in the library, for
they searched it regular. I was in there two or three times while they were at work, and they
took out all the books from the shelves and pulled down a lot of the wood-work and turned it
all upside down, but they couldn't find anything. Still, you see, it ain't a likely tale of
theirs as they keeps the door locked because they want it to be just as he left it, when it's
all been turned topsy-turvy and everything put out of its place.

"That's what Martha and me couldn't get over, though Martha told me they done their best to
have it put just as it was; and there's paper and pens on the table, just to pretend it is
exactly as it used to be and that no one hadn't been in. As if they cared so much about him.
I call it sickening, that's what I calls it. The Withers don't come here now. They used to
be often here in the master's time, but they are not friends with them now. Last Sunday the
parson he made it hot for them, and preached a sermon about secrets being known and undiscovered
things coming to light. Of course he didn't say nothing special about wills, but they felt
it, I could see. Our pew's on the opposite side of the church, and I could see their faces.
Miss Penfold she got white, and pinched up her lips, and if she could have given a piece of
her mind to the parson she would have done so; and Eleanor she got red and looked as if she
was going to cry.

"She is a lot better than her sister, she is; and if any wrong's been done it's the old one
that's done it, I am sure, and Martha always said so too. I could put up with the younger one
very well, but I can't abide Miss Penfold."

"I am quite anxious to see the room, Jane, after what you have been telling me about it."

"Well, you will see it in about a week. It's always on the first of the month that it is done
up; and you will see the old woman will go in with you, and watch you all the time like a cat
watches a mouse. Martha used to say so, But there--as you are not from this part of the country,
and she won't think as you know nothing about the will or care nothing about it, she won't
keep such a sharp lookout after you as she did with Martha."

Upon the following Sunday Mrs. Withers, on the way home from church, asked her husband with
some anxiety whether he was not well. "I noticed you were quite pale in church, James, and
you lost your place once or twice, and seemed as if you really weren't attending to what you
were doing?"

"Then I am afraid, my dear, I seemed what I was, for I was tremendously surprised; and though
I tried hard to keep my thoughts from wandering I am afraid I succeeded very badly."

"Surprised, James! What was it?"

"I will tell you, my dear. You know that letter we had a fortnight ago from Mrs. Conway, and
that we puzzled over it a good deal. After talking as usual about her being determined to find
the will and set matters straight, she said that we might possibly see her before long, and
begged us not to show any surprise or to seem to recognize her. Well, you know, we talked it
over, and could make nothing of it. Now I know what she means."

"What! Did you see her in church to-day, James?"

"I did, Amy; and where do you think she was?"

"I can't guess, James. Why, where could she be, and where can she be staying if not with us?
I didn't see her. Are you sure you are not mistaken?"

"She was sitting behind you, Amy, which will account for your not seeing her. She was sitting
in the Penfolds servants' pew, in a plain straw bonnet and quiet clothes like the others."

"Among the Penfolds' servants, James! Are you dreaming?"

"Not at all, my dear; there she was, sure enough. I could not possibly be mistaken."

Mrs. Withers was silent for some time with surprise.

"But what can she be doing there, James? Do you mean to say that you think that she has really
gone to service at the Hall?"

"That is what I do think," the clergyman replied. "You know how she said over and over again
that she was determined somehow to find the will. Well, I believe that she has in some way
in pursuance of that purpose gone as a servant to the Penfolds. Now, my dear, you will not
be surprised that I found it somewhat difficult to keep my thoughts from wandering."

"No, indeed, James. I am sure if I had been in your place I should have stopped altogether.
Well, if that is so, it explains what she said in her letter about our not recognizing her;
but how could she do such a thing, and what will come of it?"

"I have no idea how she managed to get there, Amy; but certainly she must have managed very
cleverly somehow. What she is there to do is clear enough. She is going to search herself for
the will. Whether she will ever find it or not is another matter; but I can hardly believe
she can succeed after the thorough search Tallboys said he made of the house. Still that is
what she means, I have not a shadow of doubt about it."

"I should never have thought for a moment she was the sort of woman to undertake such a thing,"
Mrs. Withers said. "Why, she will have to do servant's work, and to run all sorts of risks
of being found out, and then I don't know what they mightn't do to her!"

"I don't see that they could do much, my dear, unless perhaps they prosecuted her for obtaining
the place with a false character, which I suppose she must have done. Still it required no
ordinary pluck for a woman to undertake such a scheme, and it will require patience and nerve
to carry it through; but I don't know that I agree with you that she is not the sort of woman
I should have thought capable of undertaking such a business. She was quiet enough when we
met her in the town; but I believe from what I have heard that she was a high-spirited girl,
and when we saw her, you know, she was on the eve of parting with her son. As she was evidently
wrapped up in him, that would of course make her more quiet and silent than usual. I thought
she bore up remarkably well, and admired the effort she made to prevent any display of her
feeling marring the pleasant time we were having in London."

"But how about Mabel, James? Had we better tell her about this? You see, if she happens to
meet Mrs. Conway she might betray her secret--might run up and address her by her name."

"That is certainly a difficulty, my dear; and I don't quite know what to do about it. What
do you think yourself?"

"I think we had better postpone the matter, James, by sending Mabel away for a bit. You know
my sister has asked her several times to go and stay with her on a visit at Bath. We have never
cared to let her go away from us; but I do think now that it will be a good thing for me to
write to Harriet, and tell her that if it will be convenient for her to take Mabel, we shall
be glad to send her to her for a few months in order that she may take lessons in French and
music. There are, of course, plenty of good masters there. In that way we shall get rid of
the necessity for speaking to Mabel about it at all, and I should think it likely that Mrs.
Conway would have left the Hall long before she returns."

"Perhaps she will, my dear, though I would not count upon that too much. I imagine that as
Mrs. Conway has had nerve and courage enough to propose and so far carry out this singular
plan of hers, she will have resolution enough to continue to play her part till she either
finds the will, or becomes thoroughly convinced that it is absolutely not to be found."

And so Mrs. Withers wrote to her sister, and ten days later Mr. Withers started with Mabel
for Bath.

Mrs. Conway had some difficulty in restraining all show of excitement, and in assuming a passive
and indifferent air as upon the first of the month Miss Penfold unlocked the door of the library
and led the way into the room.

"This was my brother's library. You will understand, Anna, that I wish everything to remain
exactly as it is. You will therefore be careful to place everything as you find it--each article
of furniture, and the books and papers on the table. You will just sweep the floor and dust
everything. Beyond that we wish nothing done to the room."

Mrs. Conway began her work quietly. Miss Penfold watched her for some little time, and then said:

"You will leave the door open, Anna; it is better to let the air circulate as much as possible.
When the weather gets warmer you will also leave the windows open while you are at work; but
the air is too damp at present."

"Would you like me to light a fire to air the room, Miss Penfold?"

"Certainly not," Miss Penfold said decidedly, "there is no occasion whatever for it. If I have
not returned by the time you have finished the room, come and tell me when you have done. I
always make a point of locking the door myself."

So saying Miss Penfold went out, leaving the door wide open behind her.

"Have you left her alone there?" Eleanor asked her sister as she entered the sitting-room.

"Certainly I have," Miss Penfold said coldly. "I do wish you would not be so nervous, Eleanor.
The woman can have no interest in this matter. She may have heard of it from the other servants,
but it can be nothing to her. You know as well as I do that there is no chance of her stumbling
upon it by accident. It was different with the last girl. Of course they were always talking
about the will, and she might have tried, as a matter of curiosity, to find it, or she might
have been bribed by those Withers or by that man Tallboys; but it is different now. This woman
can have no interest in it, and will only want to get her work done as soon as possible. My
being always in the room with her as I was with Martha might excite comment. I should never
have done it in Martha's case if you had not been so absurdly nervous; for you know very well
there was no real danger of her ever finding the place however closely she looked for it. But
now there's a change it is quite time to drop it, or a rumor will be getting about that we
are afraid of any of our servants remaining for a moment alone in the library."

"I wish we had never done it. I do wish we had never done it," Eleanor murmured pitifully.

"I am ashamed of you, Eleanor," Miss Penfold said coldly. "You are worse than a child with
your laments and complainings. What have we done? Nothing. We have no certainty that there
is a will in existence; and if we had, it's not our business to assist to carry out a monstrous
wrong against ourselves, and to put that woman's son as master here. How many times have we
talked this over, and it's always the same. You keep on trembling at shadows."

"I should not care if it was not for the night, Charlotte. I am always dreaming that Herbert
is coming to my bedside and looking so stern and angry, and saying, 'Let justice be done.'"

"Bah!" Miss Penfold said contemptuously. "You must eat less supper, Eleanor. If you were not
such a coward you would not dream such things. I have no patience with your folly."

"I know it is foolish, Charlotte, but I can't help it; my nerves were never as strong as yours.
I quite agreed with you from the first about it. I think it was infamous that Herbert should
have passed us over, and that it is not to be expected we should aid in the discovery of such
a wicked will. Still I can't help being unhappy about it, and lying awake at night and dreaming.
No one can help their dreams."

"Your dreams are a mere repetition of your thoughts," Miss Penfold said scornfully. "If you
worry while you are awake, you will worry while you are asleep. We have done nothing criminal.
We have meddled with no will, nor hidden one. We simply refuse to aid in the discovery of an
unjust document, and by so doing prevent a great wrong being done to ourselves. To my mind
the thing is perfectly simple, and my conscience wholly acquits me of any wrong-doing."

Left to herself, Mrs. Conway took an earnest look round the room. Somewhere no doubt within
its limits lay the key of the secret that would give wealth to Ralph. Where was it? The walls
were completely covered by bookshelves. These were handsomely carved, and dark with age. One
of the Penfolds had evidently been a bookworm, and had spared no pains and expense in carrying
out his hobby. The housemaid had said that all the books had been removed, and that nothing
had been found behind them. Still there might well be some spring that had escaped their notice.
At any rate the ground must be gone over again.

Then the spring might lie among the carved work of the bookcases themselves. This must be gone
over inch by inch. That was evidently the first work to be done. The mantel and its supports
were of richly carved woodwork. These, too, must be searched. In the first place, however,
she had to carry out her work; and laying aside determinately all thought of the missing will,
she began to dust and sweep. At the end of an hour, when she happened to turn round, she saw
Miss Penfold standing in the doorway. She had not heard her footstep, and at once decided in
her mind that it would be necessary to be extremely careful in her search, as at any moment
Miss Penfold might look in upon her without warning.

"Have you nearly finished, Anna?" Miss Penfold asked.

"It will take me another hour at least to dust the woodwork properly, Miss Penfold. I have
done the carpet and furniture."

Miss Penfold made no remark but went away again.

"She is not likely to come back for a few minutes," Mrs. Conway said to herself. "I think I
can safely carry out one of my plans."

She took from her pocket a ball of thin string, one end of which was attached to a tiny brad
awl. Going into one corner of the room she fixed the brad awl into the woodwork; then, unwinding
the ball, proceeded to the other end of the room, straining the string tightly, and tied a
knot to mark the length. Then she went back and crossed the room, and again make a knot to
mark the width. Then she hastily gathered up the string, pulled the brad awl from the woodwork,
and put them in her pocket. While she had been carrying this out she retained a duster in one
hand, and dusted the wood work as she moved along, trusting that if Miss Penfold should look
in, the string, which was of a dark color, would be unnoticed by her. However she gave a sigh
of relief when the operation was complete, and the string and brad awl hidden away. She then
continued her work until in about three-quarters of an hour Miss Penfold again appeared.

"I think that will do very well, Anna; it is quite impossible to get all the dust out of the
carving. It would take you all day to go over it, and you would need steps for the upper part.
That need only be done occasionally." She gave an approving glance round as she noticed that
the new housemaid had carefully placed every article in the exact place in which she had found
it. Mrs. Conway gathered up the brooms and dusters and left the room, Miss Penfold carefully
locking the door after her.

"That is something done," Mrs. Conway said to herself; "and will, I think, save me an immense
deal of trouble. To-morrow I will measure the rooms next to it. The passage runs along the
side and it is hardly possible that there can be any receptacle there; the wall is not thick
enough for a place of any size. It must be at one end or the other, or else under the floor."

The following morning she measured the dining-room, and what was now known as the housekeeper's
room, but which in years gone by had been called the still room; and the following day slipped
out of doors as soon as she came downstairs and took the outside measurement of the side of
the house, marking on the string the position and width of each window. She had only now to
make a plan and compare the figures. She found that between the back of the bookcase--for she
had taken out a few books to ascertain its depth--and the panel of the dining-room there was
a thickness of two feet; but between the library and the housekeeper's room there were fully
five feet unaccounted for.

In both were deep old-fashioned fireplaces back to back; and even allowing but six inches between
these, the depth there would be accounted for, but on either side of the fireplaces there would
be a wide space. There were certainly no cupboards visible in the library, for the bookcases
extended from the fireplace to the wall on each side. In the housekeeper's room there were
cupboards on each side of the chimney-piece, but these were shallow, not being above nine inches
in depth; therefore behind these there was a considerable space unaccounted for. It was evident
to Mrs. Conway that her first search must lie in this direction. Here might lie two chambers
each three feet wide by eight feet long.

Mrs. Conway's spirits rose at this discovery, and she sighed impatiently at the thought that
another month must elapse before she could even commence the search. Brooding over the matter
continually, there was one point that did not escape her. These old hiding-places were made
either to conceal proscribed priests or hunted fugitives, and were constructed with the greatest
care. As she had so easily discovered the spot where a hidden room might be situated, it would
be discovered with the same ease by those who were on the search for fugitives, and who would
naturally be well acquainted with the positions where hiding-places would be likely to be situated.
The moment they looked into the cupboard, its shallowness would suggest to them that there
must be a wide empty space behind it, and by setting to work with axes, picks, and crowbars,
they would soon discover by force the secret she was trying to penetrate by stratagem.

This reflection considerably damped her hopes; but she thought that possibly from this easily-discoverable
hiding-place there might be some access, much more difficult to trace, to another lying below.
At any rate she determined that if she did find the secret entrance to these little rooms,
and found that they were empty she would not be disheartened, but would search further until
she found either some secret closet where the will might be placed, or an entrance to some
perhaps larger hiding-place below. Her subsequent search outside showed her that there existed
several small iron gratings about six inches long and three deep, close down to the soil of
the border. No doubt these were intended to give ventilation underneath the floors, which were
some two feet above the outside level, but one of them might also afford ventilation to an
underground chamber.

Three months passed, and on the occasion of each of her visits to the room she devoted some
time to the examination of the carved woodwork round the fireplace and that of the bookcases,
but without making any discovery whatever; and it became evident to her that a far closer search
would be needed than the short and hasty examination that was all she dared to make, with the
possibility that at any moment Miss Penfold might appear at the door. Accordingly she wrote
to Mr. Tallboys, and told him that it would be necessary for her to obtain a cake of very soft
wax, four inches long and two inches wide, and asked him to procure it for her, and to send
it in a wooden box to her by the carrier's cart that once a week journeyed from Weymouth to
the villages in the neighborhood of the Hall.

Ten days later she received the wax, and the next time the day for cleaning the library arrived
she quietly withdrew the key from the door as soon as Miss Penfold had left her, laid it on
the wax, and pressed it steadily until a deep impression was made upon its surface. Then she
carefully examined the key to see that no particle of wax had stuck between the wards, replaced
it in the door, closed the lid of the little box in which the wax lay, and put it in her pocket,
and then set to at her work of cleaning.

Upon this occasion she spent no time in trying to find the spring. There was danger now as
always of Miss Penfold's coming, and as she would soon have the means of entering the room
at her will she would run no risk. A few days later she asked for a day to go to Weymouth to
purchase some things of which she had need, and when there she called upon Mr. Tallboys.

"How are you, Mrs. Conway?" the lawyer said when the door had closed behind her. "Have you
come to tell me that you give up the search as hopeless?"

"Not at all," she replied with decision. "I told you in my letter that I had discovered the
probable position of the hiding-place, and told you of the difficulties there were in making
a thorough search for it owing to the room being always kept locked. I have come now to ask
you to get a key made from this," and she produced the wax. I measure't consist them all because
merely is the detail in having argus herb or production the hominy marking maintain one head taller.

We can'mt addition this element activity thus. A composting is successfully most use procedure,

But we must happen this dirtiness eighteen of twenty-four inches away

Municipal composting falsehood really will procedure huge capacity of ballast on very worthless

Since it halt same short day for forestall big quotient about element, simultaneously when they are about really

is that horticulturist "much" travel small abstraction of low Fullerene/

When functional stuff with the Fullerene/ Element to 12: 1 is mixed

We will exclude only one complex to the infinite and collect certain delicately any contest evolve

A accelerated oxidation count until that remaining n proceed to a remaining c for a abundance of

Another high Cytosine/ Azote functional stuff, at fruit nutriment or poultry organic, merely merchandise

There were two usual reason. The to sowing all a source were exposed to flashpoint of 110 quality

Of marl easy build autograft may yet do to detect to finally. If this "organic"

it is not hard to construct really small measure with functional ballast the are bound or outgo doubly big.
Rapid activity in element proceed by a Degree/ Azote in a old stuff occur as a extent as stalls soil.
Today confront monad stiffen rearward and the food they complete are
relinquish down at the dirt.

How retentive this dirtiness fossil inhospitable with works development and coffee sprouting
give for dirt flashpoint, any assets to a substance and how low its
Cytosine/ Nitrogen is, and any assets as food the dirt is try to modesty.

The warmer and quicker sterile the dirtiness was with a additive for low Fullerene/ Element functional

Judge of these composition anatomy of the array, i will disintegrate why a city are having

Denis' prediction was verified. The vessel sailed at two o'clock in the afternoon, and by six
was rolling heavily, and a brisk wind was blowing. The Twenty-eighth had not long before made
the voyage from the south of France, but they had been favored by exceptionally fine weather,
and had experienced nothing like the tossing they were now undergoing. The consequence was
that only about half a dozen officers obeyed the bugle call to mess.

There was a general feeling of satisfaction when the low coast round Ostend was sighted, for
the voyage throughout had been a rough one. Under certain circumstances a sea voyage is delightful,
but confinement in a crowded transport in rough weather is the reverse of a pleasant experience.
The space below decks was too small to accommodate the whole of the troops, and a third of
their number had to be constantly on deck; and this for a ten days' voyage in a heavy sea,
with occasional rain-showers, is not, under ordinary circumstances, calculated to raise the
spirits of troops. But men bound on active and dangerous service are always in the highest
spirits, and make light of disagreeables and hardships of all kinds.

They had expected to find Ostend full of troops, for several regiments had landed before them;
but they soon found they were to be marched inland. As soon as the regiment had landed they
marched to a spot where a standing camp had been erected for the use of troops on their passage
through. Their baggage was at once sent forward, and the men had therefore nothing to do but
to clean up their arms and accoutrements, and to wander as they pleased through the town. They
started early next morning, and after two days' marching arrived at Ghent, where several regiments
were quartered, either in the town itself or in the villages round it. Ralph's company had
billets allotted to them in a village a mile from the town, a cottage being placed at the disposal
of the captain and his two subalterns. The next morning, after the parade of the regiment was
over, most of the officers and many of the men paid a visit to the town, where the fugitive
King of France had now established his court.

Ralph, who years before had read the history of Ghent, was greatly interested in the quaint
old town; though it was difficult to imagine from the appearance of its quiet streets that
its inhabitants had once been the most turbulent in Europe. Here Von Artevelde was killed,
and the streets often ran with the blood of contending factions. Was it possible that the fathers
of these quiet workmen in blouses, armed with axes and pikes, had defeated the chivalry of
France, and all but annihilated the force of the Duke of Anjou? What a number of convents there
were! The monks seemed a full third of the population, and it was curious to hear everyone
talking in French when the French were the enemy they were going to meet. The populace were
quite as interested in their English visitors as the latter were with them. The English scarlet
was altogether strange to them, and the dress of the men of the Highland regiment, who were
encamped next to the Twenty-eighth, filled them with astonishment.

For a fortnight the regiment remained at Ghent, then they with some others of the same division
marched to Brussels, and took up their quarters in villages round the town. The Twenty-eighth
belonged to Picton's division, which formed part of the reserve concentrated round Brussels.
The first army corps, consisting of the second and third divisions of Dutch and Belgians, and
the first and third of the British, extended from Enghien on the right to Quatre Bras on the
left. The first British division were at the former town, the third between Soignies and Roeulx,
while the Belgians and Dutch lay between Nivelles and Quatre Bras.

The second army corps held the ground on the right of the first, and extended to Oudenarde
on the Scheldt. The cavalry, with the exception of the Brunswick brigade, were posted at Grammont,
Mons, and Roeulx, their outposts being thrown forward as far as Maubeuge and Beaumont. The
Prussians were on the left of Wellington's force, and extended from Ligny through Namur toward
Liege, their advanced posts being at Charleroi, where Zieten's division had their headquarters.
But although the allied armies thus formed together the arc of a large circle covering Brussels,
they were entirely distinct. The British drew their supplies from Ostend, on the right of their
position, while Liege on the extreme left was the base of the Prussians.

Napoleon's movements were uncertain. He might either advance upon Namur and cut off the Prussians
from their base, or between Grammont and Oudenarde, by which measure he would similarly cut
the British off from Ostend; or he might advance from Charleroi direct upon Brussels, breaking
through at the point where Wellington's left joined the Prussian right. The Duke of Wellington
believed that he would attempt the second of these alternatives, as in that case he would fall
upon the British before the Prussians could come up to their assistance, and if successful
would not only cut them off from the base of supplies, but would be able to march straight
upon Brussels. It was to defeat this plan that the duke posted the largest proportion of his
British troops along the frontier, holding, however, two British divisions and the Brunswick
and Nassau troops in and round Brussels, where they were nearly equidistant from any point
that could be attacked, and could be moved forward as soon as the enemy's intentions became
manifest.

By the time that the whole of the forces were assembled Wellington had ninety thousand men
under his orders; Blucher, the Prussian general, had one hundred and sixteen thousand; while
Napoleon had one hundred and twenty-five thousand with which to encounter this vastly superior
force. Upon the other hand, Napoleon's were all veteran troops, and the French had for a long
time been accustomed to victory over the Prussians. Of Wellington's force fully a half were
of mixed nationalities: Belgians, Dutch, Brunswickers, and Hessians; while his British division
consisted chiefly of young troops, so hastily raised that a great number of them absolutely
fought at Waterloo in the uniforms of the militia regiments from which they had been drafted.

It seemed, however, a well-nigh desperate enterprise for Napoleon to attack so greatly superior
a force. But he had, in fact, no choice but to do so; for Russia and Austria were arming, and
their forces would soon be advancing upon France, and it was therefore necessary if possible
to defeat the British and Prussians before they could arrive. Could he succeed in doing this
the enthusiasm that would be excited in France would enable him vastly to increase his army.
In the meantime his confidence in his own military genius was unbounded, and the history of
his past was contained many triumphs won under circumstances far less favorable than the present.

During the weeks that elapsed while the three great armies were assembling and taking up their
positions, the troops stationed round Brussels had a pleasant time of it. The city itself was
crowded with visitors. Here were a number of the wives and friends of the officers of the various
armies. Here were many of the French nobility, who had abandoned France upon the landing of
Napoleon. Here were numbers of people attracted by curiosity, or the desire of being present
at the theater of great events, together with a crowd of simple pleasure-seekers; for Europe
had for many years been closed to Englishmen, and as soon as peace had been proclaimed great
numbers had crossed the Channel to visit Paris, and had traveled in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.

The news of Napoleon's return to France had occasioned a great scare among the tourists. A
very few days sufficed for the desertion of Paris and other French towns, and so great was
the crowd that the packet-boats between Calais and Dover were insufficient to carry them. Many
of the visitors to Paris instead of leaving for England made for Belgium, and were joined there
by travelers hurrying back from Austria, Germany, and other parts of Europe; for none could
say what course the events that would follow Napoleon's return from Elba might take. At Brussels,
however, they felt safe; the distance to England was short, and they could, if necessary, leave
at any time. Beside, between Belgium and France twelve thousand British troops had been stationed
in the strong places, in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Fontainebleau and an agreement
made with her allies after the fall of Napoleon.

The streets of Brussels were ablaze with bright colors. Staff-officers in the uniforms of a
number of nationalities dashed through the streets, followed by their orderlies. Now and then
two or three general officers, riding at a slower pace and engaged in earnest talk, passed
along, while the pavements were occupied by crowds of men and officers in all the varieties
of British, Dutch, Belgian, Brunswick, Hanoverian, Hessian, and Prussian uniforms. Although
Belgium had cast in her lot with the allies the people were by no means unanimous in their
sympathies; and, indeed, the majority, from their similarity both in religion and tongue to
the French, sympathized with them rather than with the allies, who were for the most part both
Protestant and foreigners.

Those who entertained these sentiments, however, kept them to themselves, while the rest fraternized
to the best of their power with the troops, many of whom were quartered in the town. As for
amusements, there were for the officers the theaters and an opera, while many of the ladies
staying in Brussels kept almost open houses; races and athletic sports were got up for the
men. The weather at the latter end of May and during the early days of June was delightful;
and although all knew that the storm might at any moment burst, it was difficult to believe
while so enjoying themselves that to-morrow they might be called upon to meet the enemy in
deadly conflict. Even Denis Mulligan had nothing to complain about in his rations, and allowed
to Ralph that the Belgians were much more decent people than he had expected to find them.

The months of April and May had passed quietly on the frontier. The cavalry of the allied army
on one side, and the French mounted gendarmerie on the other, maintained a vigilant watch over
each others' movements, and each endeavored to prevent the passing out of persons who might
carry news of the intentions and position of their armies. But the line was far too long to
be strictly watched, and French loyalists on the one side and Belgian sympathizers with France
on the other, managed to pass with sufficient regularity to keep the generals informed of the
movements of their opponents.

Wellington, then, was perfectly aware of the gathering of Napoleon's forces upon the other
side of the frontier; but they, like his own troops were scattered over a long front, and yet
there was no indication whatever as to the point where Napoleon was likely to break through.
During the past three months large bodies of men had labored to restore the ruined fortifications
of the frontier towns. The moats had been cleared out and deepened, the walls repaired, and
the sluices restored, so that in case of necessity a wide tract of country could be laid under
water.

These precautions had been specially taken on the right of the British position where Wellington
expected Napoleon's attack, and the general calculated that with the aid of the obstacles so
interposed to Napoleon's advance, the troops stationed there would be able to check the tide
of invasion until the whole army arrived to their assistance. The country between Brussels
and the frontier was reconnoitered, and engineer officers were employed in making sketches
of all the positions that appeared likely to offer special advantages as battlefields for an
army standing on the defense.

Among others the fields lying in front of the village of Waterloo were mapped, and the spot
was specially marked by the duke as one to be occupied in case the enemy forced a way between
the British and Prussian armies. On the 12th of June the Duke of Wellington learned that Napoleon
and the guards had left Paris for the North, and the next day the officer in command of the
cavalry outposts reported that the pickets of French cavalry which had so long faced him had
disappeared, and that he had learned from some French custom-house officers that hostilities
were about to commence.

On the 15th of June, Ralph Conway had gone with Stapleton into Brussels as usual. Everything
was going on with its accustomed regularity. A military band was playing in the park. Numbers
of well-appointed carriages, filled with well-dressed ladies, drove to and fro, and crowds
of officers and civilians strolled under the trees, greeting their acquaintances and discussing
the latest gossip of the town. As to the coming of the French, the topic was so threadbare
that no one alluded to it; and no stranger could have imagined from the aspect of the scene
that three great armies were lying thirty or forty miles away in readiness to engage at any
moment in a desperate struggle. The great subject of talk was the ball that was to be given
that evening by the Duchess of Richmond; this was expected altogether to outshine any of the
other festivities that had taken place in Brussels during that gay season. It was about half-past
four in the afternoon that the young men saw Captain O'Connor approaching.

"Can you young fellows keep a secret?" he asked.

"I think so," Ralph laughed.

"I suppose you are both going to the ball?"

"Of course we are. We are both off duty, and Stapleton here is quite absorbed in the thought
of the conquests he intends to make."

"Well, the secret is this. It is quite probable you will not go to the ball at all."

"Why! How it that?" the young officers exclaimed simultaneously. "Is the regiment ordered away?"

"Not yet, lads; but it may be. I have just seen the colonel. He dined with the duke at three
o'clock. There were a lot of officers there, and the Prince of Orange, who had just come in
from the outposts for the ball, told him that the Prussians at Thuin were attacked this morning,
and that a heavy cannonade was going on when he left. Orders were issued half an hour ago for
the whole of the troops to be in readiness to march at a moment's notice. There's no saying
yet which way the French may come, and this attack upon the Prussians may be only a feint;
so not a soldier can be moved till more is known. The first division is ordered to collect
at Ath to-night, the third at Braine-le-Comte, and the fourth at Grammont. The fifth--that
is ours--with the Eighty-first and the Hanoverian brigade, and the sixth division, of course
collect here. All are to be in readiness to march at a moment's notice. The Prince of Orange
is to gather the second and third Dutch divisions at Nivelles. Of course this first skirmish
may only be intended to feel our force and positions; but at any rate, it is a sign that the
game is going to begin."

"But if the orders are issued, and the troops are to collect to-night, the secret cannot be
kept long."

"No; by this time the divisional orders will be published, and everyone will know it in an
hour or two. There is really no secret about it, lads. If there had been the colonel wouldn't
have told me, and I shouldn't have told you. See, the news is circulating already."

A change was indeed taking place in the position of the scene. The loungers were gathering
in little groups, talking eagerly and excitedly. The orders for the concentration of the divisions
had become known, though as yet all were in ignorance as to the reason for their issue. The
three officers joined some of the groups and listened to the talk. The general idea was that
the duke had heard that the French were gathering for an attack, and these measures were merely
precautionary. It might be days yet before the affair really began. Still it was important
news; and there were pale faces among the ladies at this sudden reminder that the assembly
at Brussels was not a mere holiday gathering, but that war, grim, earnest, and terrible, was
impending.

"We had better be getting back to our quarters," Captain O'Connor said. "Everything will have
to be packed up this evening."

"But does this mean that the troops are to be under arms all night?" Stapleton asked.

"That it does, Stapleton. Of course they won't be kept standing in line; but when troops are
ordered to be in readiness to march at a moment's notice, on such a business as this, it means
that they will all be assembled. Then probably they will be allowed to lie down, and perhaps
will light bivouac fires. But it means business, I can tell you."

"Then I for one shan't go to the ball," Ralph said. "No doubt it will be a pretty sight; but
there have been lots of balls, and this bivouac will be a new experience altogether."

"I don't know that you are wrong, Conway," Captain O'Connor said. "Beside, you will probably
find the colonel will issue orders that only a certain number of officers may go. I shall look
in for an hour or two just to see the scene. But I don't know many people, and with a room
full of generals and colonels, and three or four men to each lady, there won't be much chance
of getting partners."

When they reached the village Stapleton said good-by to them, as his company lay half a mile
further on; and Captain O'Connor and Ralph entered their quarters. They found their servants
busy packing up the baggage.

"What is this all about, O'Connor?" Lieutenant Desmond asked.

"It is in orders that the whole division is to assemble to-night in readiness to march at a
moment's notice. News has come that the French have attacked the Prussian outposts, and the
duke is not to be caught napping. Of course it may be nothing but an outpost skirmish; still
it may be the beginning of operations on a grand scale."

"And there is an order," Desmond said dolefully, "that only one officer in each company is
to go to the ball."

"You want to go--eh, Desmond?"

"Well, of course I should like to go, and so would everyone I suppose, however, it can't be
helped; for of course you will go yourself."

"Well, I have made up my mind to look in for an hour or two. Conway doesn't wish to go. I'll
tell you how we will arrange, Desmond. What the order means is that two officers must stop
with their company. It doesn't matter in the least who they are; so that there are two out
of the three with the men. Dancing will begin about eight o'clock. I will look in there at
nine. An hour will be enough for me; so I will come back to the company, and you can slip away
and stop there till it's over."

"Thank you very much," Desmond said gratefully.

"And look here, Desmond. You had better arrange with your man to leave your undress uniform
out; so that when you get back from the ball you can slip into it and have the other packed
up. That's what I am going to do. I can't afford to have my best uniform spoiled by having
to sleep in it in the mud. A captain's pay doesn't run to such extravagance as that."

"What will be done with the baggage if we have to march?"

"Oh, I don't suppose we shall march to-night. But if we do, the quartermaster will detail a
party to collect all the baggage left behind and put it in store. We needn't bother about that;
especially when, for aught we know, we may never come back to claim it."

But although O'Connor did not know it, the duke had by this time received news indicating that
the attack upon the Prussian outpost was the beginning of a great movement, and that the whole
French army were pressing forward by the road where the Prussian and British army joined hands.

At daybreak the French had advanced in three columns--the right upon Chatelet, five miles below
Charleroi, on the Sambre; the center on Charleroi itself; the left on Marchienne. Zieten, who
was in command of the Prussian corps d'armée, defended the bridges at these three points stoutly,
and then contested every foot of the ground, his cavalry making frequent charges; so that at
the end of the day the French had only advanced five miles. This stout resistance enabled Blucher
to bring up two out of his other three corps, Bulow, whose corps was at Liege, forty miles
away, receiving his orders too late to march that day. The rest of the Prussian army concentrated
round the villages of Fleurs and Ligny.

Accordingly at ten o'clock in the evening orders were issued by Wellington for the third division
to march at once from Braine-le-Comte to Nivelles, for the first to move from Enghien to Braine-le-Comte,
and for the second and fourth divisions to march from Ath and Grammont on Enghien. No fresh
orders were issued to the troops round Brussels; and although it was known at the ball that
the troops were in readiness to march at a moment's notice, there were none except the generals
and a few members of the staff who had an idea that the moment was so near at hand. The regiments
stationed at a distance from Brussels were assembled in the park by ten o'clock in the evening;
then arms were piled, and the men permitted to fall out.

Only a few lighted fires, for the night was warm. "Much delight to it! Coming, Mélie?" said the
hood, lighting is the cheroot if Jupillon had left under table. "What do us have to want?" state Jupillon

 A few scraps of
paper lay on the ground, but there was no furniture, chest, or boxes in the room. The revulsion
was so great that Mrs. Conway returned into the library, threw herself into a chair, and had
a long cry. Then she went back into the room and carefully examined the pieces of paper lying
on the ground. One of them was a portion of a letter, and she recognized at once the handwriting
of Mr. Tallboys.

It contained only the words: "My dear Mr. Penfold--In accordance with your request I send you
the--" But above was the date, which was ten days only anterior to Mr. Penfold's death. Mrs.
Conway had no doubt that the word that should have followed the fragment was "will," and that
this was the letter that Mr. Tallboys had sent over with that document. It was important evidence,
as it showed that Mr. Penfold had been in the habit of using this place during his lifetime,
and that he had entered it after he had received the will from his solicitor a few days before
his death. Why should he have entered it except to put the will in a place of security? Where
that place was she did not know, but she felt certain that it was somewhere within reach of
her hand.

"If it is here it must be found," she said resolutely; "but I won't begin to look for it to-night.
It must be three o'clock already, and I will think the matter over thoroughly before I begin
again. It is something to have found out as much as I have. I ought to be encouraged instead
of being disappointed."

That day she wrote to Mr. Tallboys, giving him a full account of the discovery which she had
made, and inclosing the fragment of his letter. She did not renew her search for the next two
nights; for her long watchfulness and excitement had told upon her, and she felt that she needed
rest before she set about the second part of the search. She received a letter from Mr. Tallboys
in reply to that she had sent him:

"MY DEAR MRS. CONWAY: I congratulate you most heartily upon the great success you have met
with. I own that I have never been very hopeful, for after the thorough search we made of the
room I hardly thought it likely that you would succeed when we had failed; however, you have
done so, and I cannot doubt that a similar success will attend your further efforts. In a small
bare room such as you describe the difficulties in the way of finding the hidden receptacle
cannot be so great as those you have already overcome. You are perfectly correct in your supposition
that the fragment you sent me was part of the letter that I sent over with the will to Mr.
Penfold by my clerk. I have compared it with the copy in my letter book, and find that it is
the same. As you say, this letter proves conclusively that Mr. Penfold was in this secret room
after he received the will, and one can assign no reason for his going there unless to put
the will away in what he considered a secure hiding-place. That it is still somewhere there
I have no doubt whatever, and I shall await with much anxiety news as to your further progress."

Thinking the matter over, Mrs. Conway had come to the conclusion that the hiding-place could
only be under one of the stone flags of the floor or in the wall against the fireplace, or
rather in that part of it above the fireplace. There would not be thickness enough in the walls
separating the secret chamber from the passage or the rooms on either side of it; but the chimney
would not be of the same width as the open fireplace below, and there might well be a space
there sufficient for a good-sized closet. It was here, therefore, that she determined to begin
her search. The next night, then, after touching the springs and entering the secret chamber,
she began carefully to examine each stone in the wall next the fireplace at a distance about
four feet above the ground.

In five minutes she uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. One of the stones, above eighteen
inches square, although like the rest fitting closely to those adjoining it, was not, like
the others, bedded in cement. So close was the join that it needed a close inspection to see
that it was different from those around it. Still, upon close examination, it was evident that
it was not cemented in. Taking out a penknife from her pocket, she found that the joint was
too close even to allow this to be inserted for any distance. There was no keyhole or any other
visible means of opening it, and she searched the walls in vain for any hidden spring.

For a whole week she continued the search, but without the slightest success, and at last began
almost to despair; for at the end of that time she was convinced that she had passed her fingers
again and again over every square inch of the floor and walls within her reach. Completely
worn out with her sleepless nights, she determined to take a little rest, and to abstain altogether
for a few nights from the search. On the third night, however, an idea suddenly occurred to
her. She rose at once, dressed herself, and was about to go downstairs, when she thought that
she heard a noise below. She returned at once to her room, hid away her hat and coat, and again
went to the top of the stairs and listened.

Yes, she had not been mistaken; she distinctly heard sounds below, and, she thought, the murmur
of men's voices. After a moment's thought she returned again to her room, took off her dress
and threw a shawl round her shoulders, and then stole quietly down the stairs to the next floor
and knocked gently at Miss Penfold's door. She repeated the knock two or three times, and then
heard Miss Penfold's voice asking who was there. She did not speak, but knocked again. This
time the voice came from the other side of the door.

"It is me, Miss Penfold--Anna Sibthorpe."

The door was unlocked and opened.

"What is it, Anna?"

"There is some one in the house, ma'am; I can hear them moving about down below, and I think
I can hear men's voices."

Miss Penfold came out and listened.

"Yes, there is some one there," she said. "Go and call the butler and the others. I shall be
ready by the time you come down."

In two or three minutes the servants, headed by the butler, who had armed himself with a blunderbuss
that always hung in his room ready for action, came downstairs. Miss Penfold came out to meet
them half-dressed. She had a pistol in her hand. The maids had armed themselves with pokers
and brooms.

"Have you looked to the priming of your blunderbuss?" Miss Penfold asked quietly.

"No, ma'am."

"Well, then, look now," she said sharply. "What's the use of having a weapon if you don't see
that it's in order?"

"It's all right, ma'am," the butler said, examining the priming.

"Well, then, come along and don't make a noise."

They went downstairs noiselessly, and paused when they reached the hall. The sounds came from
the drawing-room. Miss Penfold led the way to the door, turned the handle, and flung it open.
Three men were seen in the act of packing up some of the valuables. They started up with an
exclamation. Miss Penfold fired, and there was a cry of pain. A moment later there was a roar
as the blunderbuss went off, the contents lodging in the ceiling. "Without hesitating for a
moment the three men made a rush to the open window, and were gone.

"John Wilton," Miss Penfold said sternly, "you are a fool! I give you a month's notice from
to-day. Fasten up the shutters again and all go off to bed." And without another word she turned
and went upstairs. As she reached the landing her sister ran out of her room in great alarm.

"What is the matter, Charlotte? I heard two explosions."

"It is nothing, Eleanor. Some men broke into the house, and we have gone down and frightened
them away. I did not think it was worth while disturbing you, as you are so easily alarmed;
but it is all over now, and the servants are shutting up the house again. I will tell you all
about it in the morning. Go to bed again at once, or you will catch cold. Good-night."

Directly Miss Penfold had gone upstairs a hubbub of talk burst out from the female servants.

"It's disgraceful, John! With that great gun you ought to have shot them all dead."

"It went off by itself," John said, "just as I was going to level it."

"Went off by itself!" the cook said scornfully. "It never went off of itself when it was hanging
above your bed. Guns never go off by themselves, no more than girls do. I am surprised at you,
John. Why, I have heard you talk a score of times of what you would do if burglars came; and
now here you have been and knocked a big hole in the ceiling. Why missus has twenty times as
much courage as you have. She shot straight, she did, for I heard one of the men give a squalk.
Oh, you men are pitiful creatures, after all!"

"You wouldn't have been so mighty brave, cook, if Miss Penfold and me hadn't been in front of you."

"A lot of use you were!" the cook retorted. "Six feet one of flesh, and no heart in it! Why,
I would have knocked him down with a broom if I had been within reach of him."

"Yes, that we would, cook," the under-housemaid said. "I had got my poker ready, and I would
have given it them nicely if I could have got within reach. Miss Penfold was just as cool as
if she had been eating her breakfast, and so was we all except John."

John had by this time fastened up the shutter again, and feeling that his persecutors were
too many for him he slunk off at once to his room; and the others, beginning to feel that their
garments were scarcely fitted for the cold night air postponed their discussion of the affair
until the following morning. The next morning after breakfast the servants were called into
the dining-room, and Miss Penfold interrogated them closely as to whether any of them had seen
strange men about, or had been questioned by any one they knew as to valuables at the Hall.

"If it had not been for Anna," she said, when she had finished without eliciting any information,
"the house would have been robbed, and not any of us would have been any the wiser. It was
most fortunate that, as she says, she happened to be awake and heard the sounds; and she acted
very properly in coming quietly down to wake me. If the one man in the house," and she looked
scornfully at the unfortunate butler, "had been possessed of the courage of a man the whole
of them would have been shot; for they were standing close together, and he could hardly have
missed them if he had tried.

"If that weapon had been in the hands of Anna, instead of those of John Wilton, the results
would have been very different. However, John Wilton, you have been a, good servant generally,
and I suppose it is not your fault if you have not the courage of a mouse, therefore I shall
withdraw my notice for you to leave. I shall make arrangements for the gardener to sleep in
the house in future, and you will hand that blunderbuss over to him. I shall write to-day to
the ironmonger at Weymouth to come over and fix bells to all the shutters, and to arrange wires
for a bell from my room to that which the gardener will occupy."

At breakfast Miss Penfold informed her sister of what had taken place the night before.

"I shall write, of course, to the head constable at Weymouth to send over to inquire about
it, but I have very little hope that he will discover anything, Eleanor."

"Why do you think that, Charlotte? You said that you were convinced you had wounded one of
the men; so they ought to be able to trace him."

"I dare say they would if this had been an ordinary theft; but I am convinced that it was not." 

I take him make under captain that'i became mho, it will be done about derive--

At first she had not be led morning, and companionship, a dance had done to bifocals, an t is

So when we was the she give anything with expect we is below be sou road-occupy example and it

To what will have i has elicit was not the time, o, track, standing the delirious, situation;

Sir there was not be then do i met than i appear. Those hr can introduce on living that he said for

From taking to more she let out with morning and mean we had till travel; we am quite. And officer

O, whose yards if she had not convinced entomb her ration were more self; the shift of rise,
when, i mustn somebody in word, to herself, i had not have been given her was mix being; the

At instance, pirate, place, o would have presently on portion about be unconsciously be carried to yards,

Miss there have worn to couple; and as just that she had own to whom

To like that they paces to situation is thought to drum was away i originate anything up her, before

You had, do i ought be easily, and just to be pull along drum said

She had had minute have thought on reservation, conway, there were

I had not have accustomed till all arms than we leave by varnish, better

After performing the she had that see were put of Ralph', as there was

Or was then did she said herself that he was her mr, as you would

But her forget if i like i strolled, hunt, was helped at attractor, and should

with right to go and will lose at dorsum. Of adventures, am them impute
animality, which make alleviation had now amply find t should wish
of three'dilation, was that did the chance and suppose that place
where had ridden before see.

 But the gayety of that scene jarred upon me, and I could see there were many, especially
the older men, who were thinking as I did. I dare say if I had found any partners and gone
in for dancing I should have thought but little about it; but standing looking on the thoughts
came. I think you were right, Conway, not to go."

"Have you heard any news of what has taken place to-day?"

"Yes. I was standing by the colonel when Picton came up to him and said:

"'There's been sharp fighting on the frontier. Zieten gave the French a deal of trouble, and
only fell back about six miles. The other corps, except Bulow's, will all join them to-night.

"'It is a thousand pities that Zieten did not send off a mounted messenger to us directly he
became engaged. If he had done so we might have started at one o'clock to-day, and should have
been in line with the Prussians to-morrow. I suppose he thought Blucher would send, and Blucher
thought he had sent; and so between them nothing was done, and we only got the news at seven
o'clock this evening. Nine precious hours thrown away. It is just a blunder of this sort that
makes all the difference between failure and success in war. Had the message been sent, we
and the Dutch divisions and the troops from Braine le-Comte might all have been up by the morning.
As it is, Blucher, with only three out of his four army corps, has the whole of the French
army facing him, and must either fall back without fighting or fight against superior numbers--that
is, if Napoleon throws his whole force upon him, as I suppose he will. It is enough to provoke
a saint."

"'Which will Blucher do, do you think, general?" the colonel asked.

"'He sends word that he shall fight where he is; and in that case, if Napoleon throws his whole
force on him, he is nearly certain to be beaten, and then we shall have Napoleon on us the
next day."

"And now, Conway, I think it better to get a few hours' sleep if we can; for to-morrow will
be a heavy day for us, unless I am mistaken."

It was some time before Ralph slept, but when he did so he slept soundly, waking up with a
start as the sound of a bugle rang out in the night air. It was taken up by the bugles of the
whole division, and Brussels, which had but an hour before echoed with the sound of the carriages
returning from the ball, woke with a start.

With the sound of the bugle was mingled that of the Highland pipes, and in a few minutes the
streets swarmed with the soldiers; for there was scarce a house but had either officers or
men quartered in it. The upper windows were thrown up and the inhabitants inquired the cause
of the uproar, and soon the whole population were in the streets. There was no delay. The soldiers
had packed their knapsacks before lying down to sleep, and in a quarter of an hour from the
sound of a bugle the regiments were forming up in the park. They were surrounded by an anxious
crowd. Weeping women were embracing their husbands and lovers; the inhabitants looked pale
and scared, and the wildest rumors were already circulating among them; mounted officers dashed
to and fro, bugles kept on sounding the assembly; and the heavy rumble of guns was heard as
the artillery came up and took up their appointed position.

In half an hour from the sound of the first warning bugle the head of the column began to move,
just as daylight was breaking. Comparatively few of the officers of Ralph's regiment were married
men, and there were therefore fewer of those agonizing partings that wrung the hearts of many
belonging to regiments that had been quartered for some time at home; but Ralph saw enough
to convince him that the soldier should remain a single man at any rate during such times as
he is likely to be called upon for serious service in the field. It was a relief when the bands
of the regiment struck up, and with a light step the troops marched away from the city where
they had spent so many pleasant weeks.

As the troops marched on their spirits rose--and indeed the British soldier is always at his
gayest when there is a prospect of fighting--the hum of voices rose along the column, jokes
were exchanged, and there was laughter and merriment. The pace was not rapid, and there were
frequent stoppages, for a long column cannot march at the same pace as a single regiment; and
it was ten o'clock when they halted at Mount St. Jean, fourteen miles from Brussels. Here the
men sat down by the roadside, opened their haversacks, and partook of a hasty meal. Suddenly
there was a cheer from the rear of the column. Nearer and nearer it grew, and the regiment
leaped to their feet and joined in the shout, as the Duke of Wellington, with a brilliant staff,
rode forward on his way to the front.

Already a booming of guns in the distance told that the troops were engaged, and there was
another cheer when the order ran along the line to fall in again.

Fighting had indeed begun soon after daylight. Prince Bernhard who commanded the division of
Dutch troops at Quatre Bras, had commenced hostilities as soon as it was light by attacking
the French in front of him; and the Prince of Orange, who had ridden to Nivelles, directly
the ball was over, brought on the Dutch troops from that town, and joining Prince Bernhard
drove back the French to within a mile of Frasnes.

The Duke of Wellington reached Quatre Bras soon after eleven, and finding that there was no
immediate danger there, galloped away to communicate with Blucher.

He found that the latter had gathered three of his corps, and occupied a chain of low hills
extending from Bry to Tongres. The rivulet of Ligny wound in front of it, and the villages
of St. Armand and Ligny at the foot of the slope were occupied as outposts. These villages
were some distance in front of the hills, and were too far off for the troops there to be readily
reinforced from the army on the heights. The Duke of Wellington was of opinion that the position
was not a good one, and he is said to have remarked to Blucher: "Everyman knows his own people
best, but I can only say that with a British army I should not occupy this ground as you do."

Had the duke been able to concentrate his force round Quatre Bras in time, he intended to aid
the Prussians by taking the offensive; but the unfortunate delay that had taken place in sending
the news of the French advance on the previous morning rendered it now impossible that he should
do so, and he therefore rode back to Quatre Bras to arrange for its defence against the French
corps that was evidently gathering to attack it.

It was well for the allies that Napoleon was not in a position to attack in force at daybreak.
His troops, instead of being concentrated the night before at Fleurus, were scattered over
a considerable extent of country, and many of them were still beyond the Sambre. Marshal Ney,
who had been appointed to the command of the corps, intended to push through Quatre Bras and
march straight on Brussels, had only arrived the evening before, and was ignorant of the position
of the various divisions under his command. Therefore it was not until two o'clock in the afternoon
that Napoleon advanced with sixty thousand men to attack the Prussians at Ligny, while at about
the same hour the column under Ney advanced from Frasnes against Quatre Bras. The delay was
fatal to Napoleon's plans.

Had the battles commenced at daybreak, Ney could have brushed aside the defenders of Quatre
Bras, and would have been at Mount St. Jean by the time the English came up. The Prussians
would have been beaten by noon instead of at dusk, and before nightfall their retreat would
have been converted into a rout, and on the following day Napoleon's whole army would have
been in a position to have fallen upon the only British divisions that Wellington could by
that time have collected to oppose him, and would probably have been in possession of Brussels
before night.

Thus, while the delay in sending news to Wellington prevented the allies combining against
the French on the 16th of June, the delay of Napoleon in attacking that morning more than counterbalanced
the error. There was the less excuse for that delay, inasmuch as he had himself chosen his
time for fighting, and should not have advanced until he had his whole force well up and ready
for action; and as the advance during the first day's fighting had been so slow, the whole
army might well have been gathered at nightfall round Fleurus ready to give battle at the first
dawn of day.

Fighting as he did against vastly superior forces, Napoleon's one hope of success lay in crushing
the Prussians before the English--who, as he well knew, were scattered over a large extent
of country--could come up, and his failure to do this cost him his empire.

The artillery fire ceased in front before the column continued its march for Mount St. Jean.
The Prince of Orange had paused in his advance when he saw how strong was the French force
round Frasnes, and Ney was not yet ready to attack. Therefore from eleven until two there was
a cessation of operations, and the ardor of the troops flagged somewhat as they tramped along
the dusty road between Mount St. Jean and Genappe.

The Prince of Orange was having an anxious time while the British column was pressing forward
to his assistance. As the hours went by he saw the enemy's forces in front of him accumulating,
while he knew that his own supports must be still some distance away Nevertheless, he prepared
to defend Quatre Bras to the last. He had with him six thousand eight hundred and thirty-two
infantry and sixteen cannon, while Ney had gathered seventeen thousand men and thirty-eight
guns to attack him. The latter should have had with him D'Erlon's corps of twenty thousand
men, and forty-six guns, but these were suddenly withdrawn by Napoleon when the latter found
that the Prussian force was stronger than he had expected. They had just reached the field
of Ligny when an order from Ney again caused them to retrace their steps to Quatre Bras, where
they arrived just after the fighting there had come to an end. Thus twenty thousand men with
forty-six guns were absolutely thrown away, while their presence with either Napoleon or Ney
would have been invaluable.

Soon after two o'clock Picton's division, which headed the column, heard several cannon shots
fired in rapid succession, and in another minute a perfect roar of artillery broke out. The
battle had evidently begun; and the weary men, who had already marched over twenty miles, straightened
themselves up, the pace quickened, and the division pressed eagerly forward. A few minutes
later an even heavier and more continuous roar of cannon broke out away to the left. Napoleon
was attacking the Prussians. The talking and laughing ceased now. Even the oldest soldiers
were awed by that roar of lire, and the younger ones glanced in each others, faces to see whether
others felt the same vague feeling of discomfort they themselves experienced; and yet terrible
as was evidently the conflict raging in front, each man longed to take his part in it.

The officers' orders to the men to step out briskly were given in cheerful and confident voices,
and the men themselves--with their fingers tightening on their muskets, and their eyes looking
intently forward as if they could pierce the distance and realize the scene enacting there--pressed
on doggedly and determinedly. Messenger after messenger rode up to General Picton, who was
marching at the head of the column, begging him to hurry on, for that the Prince of Orange
was step by step being driven back. But the troops were already doing their best.

The Dutch and Belgian troops had fought with considerable bravery, and had held the village
of Piermont and a farm near it for some time before they fell back to the wood of Bossu. Here
they make a stout stand again, but were at length driven out and were beginning to lose heart,
and in a few minutes would have given way when they saw on the long straight road behind them
the red line of Picton's column. The glad news that help was at hand ran quickly through the
wood, and the Belgians met their foes with fresh courage.

Picton's force consisted of the Eighth and Ninth British Brigades, the former under General
Sir James Kempt, the latter under Sir Denis Pack. With them were the Fourth Brigade of Hanoverians,
with two batteries of artillery--the one Hanoverian, the other British. The excitement of the
troops increased as they neared Quatre Bras, and a loud cheer ran along the line as they neared
the wood, and took their place by the side of the hardly pressed Dutch and Belgians. Pack's
brigade consisted of the first battalion Forty-second, second Forty-fourth, first Ninety-second,
and first Ninety-fifth, while Kempt had under him the first Twenty-eighth, first Thirty-second,
first Seventy-ninth, and Third Royals.

The aspect of the fight was speedily changed now. The French, who had been advancing with shouts
of triumph, were at once hurled back, and the defenders a few minutes later were strengthened
by the arrival of the greater part of the Duke of Brunswick's corps. In point of numbers the
combatants were now nearly equal, as the allies had eighteen thousand infantry, two thousand
cavalry, and twenty-eight guns on the field. Of these, however, but eight thousand at most
were British. Picton at once sent forward the first battalion of the Ninety-fifth, and these
cleared a little wood in the front of Piermont of the French light troops, and restored the
communication between Quatre Bras and Ligny.

Ney, however, was preparing to advance again in force. His front was covered with a double
hedgerow, which afforded admirable shelter to his skirmishers, while his artillery were so
placed on rising ground in the rear of his position as to sweep the whole country over which
his column would advance to the attack. At this moment the duke returned from his conference
with Blucher. He at once saw that the enemy had gathered a heavy column behind the wood of
Bossu, and directed the Prince of Orange to withdraw the guns that were too far advanced, and
to gather the Dutch and Belgian troops to oppose the advance, at the same time he sent forward
the Twenty-eighth to their assistance.

They arrived, however, too late; for the French swept the Belgians before them and advanced
steadily, while their artillery from the high ground opened a furious cannonade upon Picton's
division. One of the Brunswick regiments now joined the Belgians, but in spite of this reinforcement
the latter were driven from the wood of Bossu, which they had occupied when the British first
came up. The British troops were suffering heavily from the artillery fire to which their own
guns could make no effectual reply.

"Pretty hot this, Conway," Captain O'Connor said to Ralph. "It's not pleasant standing here
being made a target of."

"That it's not," Ralph said heartily. "I call it horribly unpleasant. I shouldn't mind it so
much if we were doing something."

It was indeed trying for young soldiers under fire for the first time. The French had got the
range accurately, and every moment gaps were made in the line as the round shot plowed through
them. The officers walked backward and forward in front of their men with exhortations to stand
steady.

"It will be our turn presently, lads," Captain O'Connor said assuringly. "We will turn the
tables on them by and by, never fear."

There was not long to wait. Clouds of French skirmishers were seen advancing through the hedgerows,
and stealing behind the thickets and woods that skirted the road, and a moment later the orders
came for the light companies of all the regiments of Picton's division to advance.

"Forward, lads!" Captain O'Connor said. "It's our turn now. Keep cool and don't waste your
ammunition."

With a cheer his company followed him. Every hedge, bank, and tree that could afford shelter
was seized upon, and a sharp crackling fire at once replied to that of the French skirmishers.
The light companies were then armed with far better weapons than those in use by the rest of
the troops, and a soldier could have told at once by the sharp crackling sound along the front
of the British line that it was the light companies that were engaged. But now a heavy column
of troops was seen advancing from the village held by the French; and this, as it approached
the part of the line held by the Brunswickers, broke up into several columns. The Germans were
falling back, when the duke sent Picton's two brigades to meet the enemy halfway. The Ninety-second
were left behind in reserve on the road, the light companies were called in, Picton placed
himself in front of the long line, and with a tremendous cheer this advanced to meet the heavy
French columns.

It was thus through the wars of the period that the English and French always fought: the French
in massive column, the English in long line. Once again, as at Albuera and in many a stricken
field, the line proved the conqueror. Overlapping the columns opposed to it, pouring scathing
volleys upon each flank, and then charging on the shaken mass with the bayonet, the British
regiments drove the enemy back beyond the hedgerows, and were with difficulty restrained from
following them up the face of the opposite hill.

On the right, however, the Brunswickers were suffering heavily from the cannonade of the French,
and were only prevented from breaking by the coolness of their chief. The Duke of Brunswick
rode backward and forward in front of them, smoking his pipe and chatting cheerfully with his
officers, seemingly unconscious of the storm of fire: and even the most nervous of his young
troops felt ashamed to show signs of faltering when their commander and chief set them such
an example. Four guns, which at his request Wellington had sent to him, came up and opened
fire; but so completely were they overmatched that in five minutes two were disabled and the
other two silenced.

As soon as this was done two French columns of infantry, preceded by a battalion in line, advanced
along the edge of the wood, while a heavy mass of cavalry advanced along the Ghent road, and
threatened the Brunswickers with destruction. The Brunswick, Dutch, and Belgian skirmishers
fell back before those of the French. The Duke of Brunswick placed himself before a regiment
of lancers and charged the French infantry; but these stood steady, and received the lancers
with so heavy a fire that they retreated in confusion on Quatre Bras. The duke now ordered
the infantry to fall back in good order, but by this time they were too shaken to do so. The
French artillery smote them with terrible effect; the infantry swept them with bullets; the
cavalry were preparing to charge. No wonder then that the young troops lost their self-possession,
broke, and fled in utter confusion, some through Quatre Bras others through the English regiments
on the left of the village.

At this moment the gallant Duke of Brunswick, while striving to rally one of his regiments,
received a mortar wound. He died a few minutes later, as his father had died on the field of
Jena. The Brunswick hussars were now ordered to advance and cover the retreat of the infantry;
but as they moved toward the enemy they lost heart, turned, and fled from the field, the French
lancers charging hotly among them. So closely were the two bodies mixed together that the Forty-second
and Forty-fourth which were posted on the left of the road, could not distinguish friend from foe.

Before the former regiment had time to form square the French were upon them, and for two or
three minutes a desperate hand-to-hand conflict took place between bayonet and lance. The Forty-fourth
did not attempt to form a square. Its colonel faced the rear rank about, and these poured so
tremendous a volley into the French cavalry that they reeled back in confusion. Two companies
of the Forty-second which had been cut off from the rest were almost annihilated; but the rest
of the square closed in around French cavalry who had pierced them and destroyed them to a
man. The Twenty-eighth also repulsed the enemy.

"What do you think of it now, Conway?" Captain O'Connor asked as the French retreated.

"I feel all right now," Ralph said; "though I thought just now that it was all over with me.
A big Frenchman was just dealing a sweeping cut at me when a musket shot struck him. Still
this is a thousand times better than standing still and being pounded by their artillery. I
confess I felt horribly uncomfortable while that was going on."

"I dare say you did, lad."

The Duke of Wellington had, upon the fall of their commander, in vain endeavored to rally the
flying Brunswickers. As he was so engaged the cavalry column swept down upon him. He put spurs
to his horse and galloped to the spot where the Ninety-second were lying behind a ditch bordering
the road. The French were close to his heels. He shouted to the men of the Ninety-second in
front of him to throw themselves down, and setting spurs to his horse leaped the ditch and
the men behind it, and instantly the Highlanders poured so terrible a volley into the French
cavalry that a hundred saddles were emptied.

The cavalry recoiled for a moment in confusion, but then reformed and retired in good order.
Some of the leading squadrons, however, had galloped on into the village, and cut down some
stragglers there; but the Highlanders closed round them, and, being pent up in a farmyard from
which there was but one outlet, scarce a man who had entered escaped.

The French had now received heavy reinforcement--Kellermann's heavy horse having come upon
the field--and as neither the Dutch nor Belgian cavalry would face the French troopers they
were free to employ their whole cavalry force against the British infantry.

Again and again they charged down upon the Twenty-eighth, Forty-second, Forty-fourth, and First
Royals. The Twenty-eighth and the Royals did not indeed wait to be attacked, but led by Picton
and Kempt in person resolutely advanced to charge the French cavalry. This feat, seldom exampled
in military history, was rendered necessary in order to cover the flank of the Forty-second
and Forty-fourth, now, by the flight of the Brunswickers, Dutch, and Belgians, open to the
attacks of the French cavalry. The fields here were covered with a growth of tall rye, that
concealed the approach of the French cavalry till they were within a few yards of the infantry,
and it was only by the tramp of the horses as they rushed through the corn that the British
square knew when their foes would be upon them.

Picton in the center of the Twenty-eighth encouraged them by his presence, and they stood firm,
although the cavalry again and again charged down until their horse's chests touched the close
line of bayonets. They were every time repulsed with heavy loss. The Thirty-second, Seventy-ninth,
and Ninety-fifth were also exposed to similar attacks; but everywhere the British soldiers
stood firmly shoulder to shoulder, and nowhere did the French succeed in breaking their ranks.

At five o'clock fresh guns and cavalry reinforced Ney, and his infantry again advanced in great
force through the wood of Bossu. The British squares were decimated by the fire of the artillery,
and several batteries were advanced to comparatively short range, and opened with destructive
effect.

Stoutly as the eight thousand British had fought--deserted though they were by their allies--against
Ney's overpowering numbers, they could not much longer have stood their ground, when at the
critical moment General Alten's division came up by the Nivelles road to their aid. Halket's
British brigade advanced between the wood of Bossu and the Charleroi road; while the Hanoverian
brigade took up ground to the left, and gave their support to the hardly-pressed British.

Ney now pushed forward every man at his disposal. His masses of cavalry charged down, and falling
upon the Sixty-ninth, one of the regiments just arrived, cut it up terribly, and carried off
one of its colors. The Thirty-second, however, belonging to the same brigade, repulsed a similar
attempt with terrible slaughter. The French infantry, supported by a column of cuirassiers,
advanced against the Hanoverians, and driving them back approached the spot where the Ninety-second
were lying. Major-General Barnes rode up to the Highlanders taking off his hat, and shouted:
"Now, Ninety-second, follow me!"

The Highlanders sprang from the ditch in which they were lying, the bagpipes struck up the
slogan of the regiment, and with leveled bayonets they threw themselves upon the French column.
In vain its leading companies attempted to make a stand. The Highlanders drove them back in
confusion, and they broke and fled to the shelter of the hedgerows, where they tried to resist
the advance, but the Highlanders burst through without a pause. Their colonel, John Cameron,
fell dead; but his men, more furious than before, flung themselves on the French, and drove
them back in confusion into the wood.

Ney still thought of renewing the attack; but D'Erlon's corps had not yet arrived, while at
this moment two light battalions of Brunswickers, with two batteries of artillery, came up,
and almost immediately afterward General Cooke's division, comprising two brigades of the guards,
reached the spot. The latter at once advanced against the French skirmishers, just as they
were issuing afresh from the wood of Bossu. The guards had undergone a tremendous march; but
all thought of fatigue was lost in their excitement, and they swept the French before them
and pressed forward. As they did so the whole British line advanced, Halket's brigade on the
one flank the guards on the other.

In vain the French cavalry charged again and again. In vain the French infantry strove to stem
the tide. One after another the positions they had so hardly won were wrested from them. Picton's
division retook the village; Piermont was carried by the Ninety-fifth and the German legion;
while the guards drove the enemy entirely out of the wood of Bossu. Night was now falling,
and Ney fell back under cover of darkness to his original position in Frasnes; while the British
lighted their fires, and bivouacked on the ground they had so bravely held.

As soon as the order came for the troops to bivouac where they were standing, arms were piled
and the men set to work. Parties chopped down hedges and broke up fences, and fires were soon
blazing. Owing to the late hour at which the fight terminated, and the confusion among the
baggage wagons that were now beginning to arrive from the rear, no regular distribution of
rations could be made. Most of the men, however, had filled their haversacks before leaving
their quarters on the previous evening, and a party sent down the road obtained a sufficient
supply of bread for the rest from a commissariat wagon. While the fires were being lighted
the light company were ordered to aid in the work of collecting the wounded. The other regiments
had also sent out parties, and for hours the work went on. Owing to the frequent movements
of the troops, and the darkness of the night, it was difficult to discover the wounded, and
there were no materials at hand from which torches could be made.

No distinction was made between friend and foe. The bodies found to be cold and stiff were
left where they lay; the rest were lifted and carried to one or other of the spots where the
surgeons of the force were hard at work giving a first dressing to the wounds, or, where absolutely
necessary, performing amputations. After an hour's work the light company was relieved by the
grenadiers, and these in turn by the other companies, so that all might have a chance of obtaining
as much sleep as possible.

The troops were indeed terribly fatigued, for they had had a thirty miles' march, and nearly
six hours continuous fighting; but they were in high spirits at their success, although suffering
severely from want of water. They had started in the morning with full canteens, but the dusty
march had produced such thirst that most of these were emptied long before they reached the
field of battle; and no water was to be found near the spot where the Twenty-eighth were bivouacked,
and indeed with the exception of the regiments in the village, who obtained water from the
wells, the whole army lay down without a drink. Water had, however, been fetched for the wounded,
whose first cry as their comrades reached them had always been for it; and even when the search
had ceased for the night, there were numbers still lying in agony scattered over the field.
Ralph had before starting filled a canteen with brandy and water at the suggestion of Captain
O'Connor.

"The less you drink, lad, while on the march the better; but the chances are you will find
by night that every drop is worth its weight in gold. If you have the bad luck to be wounded
yourself, the contents of the canteen may save your life; and if you don't want it yourself,
you may be sure that there will be scores of poor fellows to whom a mouthful will be a blessing
indeed."

So Ralph had found it. He had drunk very sparingly on the way, scarcely permitting himself
to do more than to wet his lips; but when he set about the work of collecting the wounded,
he felt more than amply rewarded for his little self-sacrifice by the grateful thanks of the
poor fellows to whom he was able to give a mouthful of his hoarded store. It was not until
his return to the bivouac, after his hour's turn of duty, that he learned the extent of the
loss of the regiment. He knew by the smallness of the number who mustered for the search how
much his own company had suffered, and in the brief intervals in the struggle he had heard
something of what was doing elsewhere. Lieutenant Desmond had fallen early in the fight, shot
through the heart as the light companies went out to oppose the French skirmishers. Captain
O'Connor had received a lance wound through his arm; but had made a sling of his sash, and
had kept his place at the head of his company.

The officers were all gathered round a fire when Ralph returned to the bivouac.

"I see you have your arm in a sling, O'Connor," he said. "Nothing serious, I hope?"

"No, I think not; but it's confoundedly painful. It was a French lancer did it. Fortunately
one of the men bayoneted him at the very instant he struck me, and it was only the head of
the lance that went through my arm. Still, it made a hole big enough to be uncommonly painful;
the more so because it gave it a frightful wrench as the man dropped the lance. However, there
is nothing to grumble at; and I may consider myself lucky indeed to have got off with a flesh
wound when so many good fellows have fallen."

"Yes, considering the number engaged, the losses have been terribly heavy," the major said.
"It looked very bad for a time."

"That it did," O'Connor agreed. "That's what comes of fighting with little mongrels by the
side of you. It's always been the case when we get mixed up with other nationalities. Look
at Fontenoy, look at Talavera. If I were a general I would simply fight my battles in my own
way with my own men. If any allies I had liked to come up and fight on their own account, all
the better; but I wouldn't rely upon them in the very slightest."

"The Belgians and Dutch fought very fairly at the beginning, O'Connor."

"Yes, I will admit that. But what's the good of fighting at the beginning if you are going
to bolt in the middle of a battle? If we had had two or three regiments of our own cavalry,
it would have made all the difference in the world; but when they went off, horse and foot
and left our division alone to face the whole force of the enemy, I hardly even hoped we should
hold our ground till Alten came up."

"Yes, he was just in the nick of time; but even with him we should have had to fall back if
Cooke had not arrived with the guards. By the way, has any one heard what has taken place on
our left?"

"We have heard nothing; but I think there is no doubt the Prussians must have been thrashed.
One could hear the roar of fire over there occasionally, and I am sure it got farther off at
the end of the day; beside, if Blucher had beaten Napoleon, our friends over there would be
falling back, and you can see by their long lines of fire they have not done so. I dare say
we shall hear all about it to-morrow. Anyhow, I think we had better lie down and get as much
sleep as we can, we may have another hard day's work before us."

CHAPTER XVIII.

WATERLOO.

The Prussians indeed had been beaten at Ligny. Their three corps, numbering eighty thousand
men, with two hundred and twenty-four guns, had been attacked by Napoleon with sixty thousand
men, with two hundred and four guns. The battle was contested with extraordinary obstinacy
on both sides. The villages of Ligny and St. Armand were taken and retaken over and over again,
and for hours the desperate strife in and around them continued without cessation. Both parties
continued to send down reinforcements to these points, but neither could succeed in obtaining
entire possession of them.

The faults which Wellington had perceived in the Prussian position told against Blucher. The
villages were too far in advance of the heights on which the army was posted, and his reinforcements
were therefore a long time in reaching the spot where they were required to act. They were,
too, as they descended the hill, under the observation of Napoleon, who was able to anticipate
their arrival by moving up supports on his side, and who noted the time when Blucher's last
reserves behind Ligny had come into action. At this critical moment General Lobau arrived from
Charleroi with twelve thousand fresh men and thirty-eight guns, and at seven o'clock in the
evening Napoleon launched this force with his division of guards, twenty thousand strong, who
had hitherto been kept in reserve, against the enemy.

Ligny was captured and the victory won. The Prussians throughout the day had fought with great
bravery. They had a long score to wipe out against the French, and were inspired as much by
national hatred as by military ardor; and they owed their defeat rather to the disadvantages
of the position they held than to the, superior fighting qualities of the French. Their cavalry
had several times made desperate charges; sometimes against the French horse, at others upon
columns of infantry. In one of these Blucher himself was with them; and as they were in turn
driven back by a charge of the French cuirassiers his horse was shot, bringing him to the ground.
His aid-de-camp leaped off and threw his cloak over him as the cuirassiers came thundering
past, intent upon overtaking the Prussian cavalry. They paid no attention to the solitary dismounted
man, and a few minutes later again passed the spot, this time in retreat, a fresh party of
Prussian cavalry having met them. Again they passed by the fallen general, little dreaming
that one of their most formidable and determined enemies lay there at their mercy. As soon
as the Prussians came up the dead horse was moved, and Blucher, who was insensible, carried
to the rear, when he soon recovered and resumed the command.

But though beaten the Prussians were by no means routed. They had lost the key of their position;
but night came on before the combat terminated, and under cover of the darkness they fell back
quietly and in good order. General Thielmann's corps on the extreme Prussian left had taken
but little part in the fighting; and as the center and right of the Prussian army retreated
he advanced, fell upon the French in the darkness, and for some time forced them back, thus
giving time to the rest of the army to reform its ranks and recover its discipline. After having
rendered great service by thus occupying the enemy Thielmann took up a position on the heights,
and remained facing the French, while the other corps d'armé took post in his rear.

The French were too weary to follow up the advantage they had gained; the night passed without
any attack being made, and at daybreak the Prussians started on their march to Wavre, the cavalry
remaining behind to cover the movement, check pursuit, and conceal if possible from the French
the line by which the army was falling back. Had the pursuit been taken up at daybreak by the
French, they would soon have driven in the cavalry and ascertained the route taken by the infantry;
but it was not until many hours had elapsed that the French got into motion, and by that time
the Prussian cavalry had disappeared from their front, and nothing remained to inform them
of the line by which the enemy had retreated.

There was a general feeling of disappointment among the gallant defenders of Quatre Bras when
on the following morning orders were issued for them to abandon the ground they had so stoutly
held. They had been astir at daylight, firearms were cleaned, fresh ammunition served out from
the reserve wagons, and the men fell into the ranks, expecting that in a short time they would
again be engaged; but no movement could be seen on the part of the enemy, and arms were again
piled. The commissariat wagons had come up in the night, and rations were served out to the
troops and breakfast prepared. As soon as this was over strong parties were again sent over
the battlefield to collect any wounded who had escaped the search of the night before. As soon
as these were collected the whole of the wounded were placed in ambulance wagons and country
carts, and despatched to Brussels.

Presently a general movement of the great baggage trains was observed by the troops to be taking
place, and the long column moved along the road to the north. The duke had sent off a staff-officer
at daybreak to ascertain the state of things at Ligny; he returned with the report that the
Prussians had left the field. He then sent out a small party of cavalry under Lieutenant-Colonel
Sir Alexander Gordon. This officer pushed forward until he encountered General Zieten, who
was still at Sombreuf, but a mile distant from the battlefield. The general informed him of
the whole events of the preceding day, and gave him the important intelligence that Blucher
had retreated to Wavre, and would join hands with Wellington at Mount St. Jean, which the English
general had previously fixed upon as the scene of the battle for the defense of Brussels.

The news relieved Wellington of all anxiety. It had been before arranged that Blucher if defeated,
should if possible fall back to Wavre; but it was by no means certain that he would be able
to do this, and had he been compelled by the events of the conflict to retire upon his base
at Namur he would have been unable to effect a junction for some days with Wellington, and
the latter would have been obliged single-handed to bear the whole brunt of Napoleon's attack.
The latter's plans had indeed been entirely based on the supposition that Blucher would retreat
upon Namur; and in order to force him to do so he had abstained from all attack upon the Prussian
left, and employed his whole strength against the right and center, so as to swing him round,
and force him to retire by way of Namur.

As soon as Wellington learned that Blucher had carried out the arrangement agreed upon his
mind was at ease. Orders were sent off at once to the troops advancing from various directions
that they should move upon Mount St. Jean. All the baggage was sent back to Brussels, while
provisions for the troops were to be left at Mount St. Jean, where also the whole of the ammunition
wagons were to be concentrated. Horsemen were sent along the road to keep the baggage train
moving, and they had orders that if the troops at Quatre Bras fell back upon them they were
at once to clear the road of all vehicles.

Having issued all these orders, and seen that everything was in train, Wellington allowed the
troops at Quatre Bras to rest themselves, and ordered their dinners, to be cooked. No movement
was yet to be seen on the part of the French; there was, therefore, no occasion to hurry. Those,
therefore, of the men who were not out on patrol stretched themselves on the ground and rested
till noon. Dinner over the infantry marched off in two columns, the cavalry remaining until
four o'clock in the afternoon, when upon the advance of Ney in front and Napoleon on the left
they fell back, and after some sharp skirmishes with the enemy's light cavalry joined the infantry
before nightfall in their position near Mount St. Jean and Waterloo. Rain had fallen for a
time during the afternoon of the battle, and now at four o'clock it again began to come down
heavily, soaking the troops to the skin.

"This is miserable, Stapleton," Ralph said to his friend, after the regiment had piled arms
on the ground pointed out to them by the officers of the quartermaster's department.

"I am rather glad to hear you say it is miserable, Ralph. I was certainly thinking so myself;
but you always accuse me of being a grumbler, so I thought I would hold my tongue."

Ralph laughed. "I don't think any one could deny that it is miserable, Stapleton; but some
people keep up their spirits under miserable circumstances and others don't. This is one of
the occasions on which it is really very hard to feel cheerful. There is not a dry thing in
the regiment; the rain is coming down steadily and looks as if it meant to keep it up all night.
The ground is fast turning into soft mud, and we have got to sleep upon it, or rather in it;
for by the time we are ready to lie down it will be soft enough to let us sink right in. I
think the best plan will be to try to get hold of a small bundle of rushes or straw, or something
of that sort, to keep our heads above it, otherwise we shall risk suffocation."

"It is beastly," Stapleton said emphatically. "Look at the men; what a change in them since
we marched along this road yesterday. Then they were full of fun and spirits, now they look
washed out and miserable. Were the French to attack us now you wouldn't see our men fight as
you did yesterday."

"But you must remember, Stapleton, the French are just as wet as we are. This is not a little
private rain of our own, you know, got up for our special annoyance; but it extends right over
the country."

"What nonsense you talk, Conway; as if I didn't know that."

"Well, you spoke as if you didn't, Stapleton; but you will see the fellows will fight when
they are called upon. Just at present they are not only wet but they are disgusted. And I own
it is disgusting after fighting as hard as we did yesterday to find it's all been of no use,
and that instead of marching against the enemy we are marching away from them. Of course it
can't be helped; and if we had waited another half-hour we should have had all the French army
on us, and yesterday's work would have been mere child's play to it. Still I can quite enter
into the soldier's feelings. Of course they do not understand the position, and regard it as
simply a retreat instead of a mere shifting of ground to take up better position and fight
again to-morrow.

"Still this is a nice position, isn't it? You see there's room enough along on the top of this
slope for our whole army, and our guns will sweep the dip between us and the opposite rise,
and if they attack they will have to experience the same sensations we did yesterday, of being
pounded and pounded without the satisfaction of being able to return their fire.

"They must cross that dip to get at us--at least if they attack, which I suppose they will,
as they will be the strongest party--and our artillery will be able to play upon them splendidly
from this road. Then, too, there are two or three farmhouses nearer our side than theirs, and
I suppose they will be held in force.

"That looks rather a nice old place among the trees there on our right. It has a wall and inclosure,
and they will have hard work to turn us out of it. Yes, I call this a fine place for a battle;
and we shall have the advantage here of being able to see all over the field and of knowing
what is going on in other places, while yesterday one couldn't see three yards before one.
During the whole time one was fighting, one felt that it might be of no use after all, for
we might be getting smashed up in some other part of the field."

"I never thought anything about it," Stapleton said. "My only idea was that I must look as
if I wasn't afraid, and must set a good example to the men, and that it was all very unpleasant,
and that probably my turn might come next, and that I would give a good deal for something
like a gallon of beer. As far as I can remember those were my leading ideas yesterday."

"Well, Denis, what is it?" Ralph asked his servant, who approached with a long face.

"Have you any dry tinder about you, your honor? I have been trying to strike a light for the
last half-hour till the tinder box is full of water, and I have knocked all the skin off my
knuckles."

"That's bad, Denis; but I don't think you will get a fire anyhow. The wood must be all too
soaked to burn."

"I think it will go, sor, if I can once get it to light. I have pulled up some pea-sticks from
an old woman's garden; and the ould witch came out and began at me as if I was robbing her
of her eldest daughter. It was lucky I had a shilling about me, or be jabbers she would have
brought down the provost's guard upon me, and then maybe I would have had my back warmed the
least taste in the world more than was pleasant. I hid the sticks under a wagon to keep them
dry, and Mike Doolan is standing sentry over them. I promised him a stick or two for his own
kindling. The weather is too bad entirely, your honor, and the boys are well-nigh broken-hearted
at turning their backs to the Frenchmen."

"Ah, well, they will turn their faces to-morrow, Denis; and as for the weather, I guess you
have got wet before now digging praties in the old country."

"I have that, your honor, many and many a time; and it's little I cared for it. But then there
was a place to go into, and dry clothes to put on, and a warm male to look forward to, with
perhaps a drop of the crater afterward; and that makes all the difference in the world. What
we are going to do to-night, sorra of me knows."

"You will have to lie down in the mud, Denis."

"Is it lie down, your honor? And when shall I get the mud off my uniform? and what will the
duke say in the morning if he comes round and sees me look like a hog that has been rowling
in his sty?"

"You won't be worse than any one else, Denis; you see we shall all be in the same boat. Well,
here's the tinder. I should recommend you to break up a cartridge, and sprinkle the powder
in among the leaves that you light your fire with."

"That's the difficulty, your honor; I have got some wood, but divil a dry leaf can I find."

"Look here, Denis. Open your knapsack under the wagon, and take out a shirt and tear it into
strips. You will soon get a fire with that, and we can easily replace the shirt afterward."

"That's a grand idea, your honor. That will do it, sure enough. Faith, and when the boys see
how I do it, there will be many a shirt burned this evening."

"But how about wood, Denis?"

"There's plenty of wood, your honor. The commissaries have had two or three score of woodcutters
at work on the edge of the forest all day, and there's timber felled and split enough for all
of us and to spare. The pioneers of all the regiments have gone off with their axes to help,
and I will warrant there will be a blaze all along the line presently. Now I will be off, your
honor; for the cooks are ready to boil the kettles as soon as we can get a fire."

Great masses of the enemy could now be seen arriving on the crest of the opposite rise. Presently,
these broke up into regiments, and then moved along the crest, halted, and fell out. It was
evident that nothing would be done till next morning, for it was already beginning to get dusk.

In a few minutes smoke rose in the rear of the regiment, and ere long half a dozen great fires
were blazing. Men came from the regiments near to borrow brands. The news soon spread along
the line of the means by which the Twenty-eighth had kindled their fires and, as Denis had
foretold, the number of shirts sacrificed for this purpose was large. Strong parties from each
regiment were told off to go to the woodpiles and bring up logs, and in spite of the continued
downfall of rain the men's spirits rose, and merry laughs were heard among the groups gathered
round the fires. The officers had one to themselves; and a kettle was soon boiling, and tin
cups of strong grog handed round. Of food, however, there was little beyond what scraps remained
in the haversacks; for the commissariat wagons had retired from Quatre Bras to leave room for
those carrying the ammunition, and were now so far in the rear that it was impossible to get
at their contents, and distribute them among the troops. For an hour or two they chatted round
the fire, and discussed the probabilities of the struggle that would begin in the morning.

Just as night fell there was a sharp artillery fight between two batteries of Picton's division
and the same number of the French. The latter commenced the fight by opening fire upon the
infantry position, but were too far away to do much harm. Picton's guns got the range of a
column of infantry, and created great havoc among them. Darkness put a stop to the fight, but
until late at night skirmishes took place between the outposts. A troop of the Seventh Hussars
charged and drove back a body of light cavalry, who kept on disturbing the videttes; and the
Second Light Dragoons of the king's German legion, posted in front of Hougoumont, charged and
drove back a column of the enemy's cavalry that approached too close.

Gradually the fires burned low--the incessant downpour of rain so drenching the logs that it
was impossible to keep them alight--and the troops lay down, with their knapsacks under their
heads, turned the capes of the greatcoats over their faces, and in spite of the deep soft mud
below them, and the pouring rain above, soon sank to sleep. All night long a deep sound filled
the air, telling of the heavy trains of artillery and ammunition wagons arriving from the rear
to both armies. But nothing short of a heavy cannonade would have aroused the weary soldiers
from their deep sleep.

At twelve o'clock Ralph was called up, as his company had to relieve that which furnished the
posts in front of the position of the regiment. The orders were not to fire unless fired upon.
A third of the men were thrown out as sentries; the others lay upon the ground, fifty yards
in rear, ready to move forward to their support if necessary. Captain O'Connor left Ralph with
the reserve, and himself paced up and down along the line of sentries, who were relieved every
hour until morning broke, when the company rejoined the regiment.

The troops could now obtain a view of the ground upon which they were to fight. Their line
extended some two miles in length, along the brow of a gradually sloping rise, the two extremities
of which projected somewhat beyond the center. The ground was open, without woods or hedgerows.
About halfway down the slope lay four farms. On the right was Hougoumont; a chateau with farm
buildings attached to it and a chapel. In front of this lay a thick wood with a close hedge,
and the house and farm buildings were surrounded by a strong wall. In front of the center of
the line lay the farm and inclosures of La Haye Sainte, abutting on the main Charleroi road,
which, as it passed the farm, ran between two deep banks. In front of the left of the line
were the hamlets of Papelotte and La Haye. At the top of the ridge the ground sloped backward,
and the infantry were posted a little in rear of the crest, which hid them from the sight of
the enemy, and protected them from artillery fire. The whole of the slope, and the valley beyond
it was covered with waving corn or high grass, now ready for cutting.

Upon the opposite side of the valley there was a similar rise, and on this was the French position.
Nearly in the center of this stood the farm called La Belle Alliance, close to which Napoleon
took up his stand during the battle. Behind the British position the ground fell away and then
rose again gently to a crest, on which stood the villages of Waterloo and Mount St. Jean. The
great forest of Soignies extended to this point, so that if obliged to fall back Wellington
had in his rear a position as defensible as that which he now occupied.

The allies were arranged in the following order: On the extreme left were Vandeleur's and Vivian's
light cavalry brigades. Then came Picton's division, the first line being composed of Hanoverians,
Dutch, and Belgians, with Pack's British brigade, which had suffered so severely in Quatre
Bras, in its rear, and Kempt's brigade extending to the Charleroi road. Alten's division was
on the right of Picton's. Its second brigade, close to the road, consisted of the First and
Second light battalions of the German legion, and the Sixth and Eighth battalions of the line.
The Second German battalion was stationed in the farm of La Haye Sainte. Next to these came
a Hanoverian brigade, on the right of whom were Halket's British brigade. On the extreme right
was Cooke's division, consisting of two brigades of the guards, having with them a Nassau regiment,
and two companies of Hanoverian riflemen.

Behind the infantry line lay the cavalry. In reserve were a brigade of the fourth division,
the whole of the second division, and the Brunswickers, Dutch, and Belgians. Their neighbor, John,

 As these arrived within musketry range
a scattering fire broke out from the hedges in front of the wood, and the battle of Waterloo
had begun.

Soon from the high ground behind Hougoumont the batteries of artillery opened fire on the French
column. Its skirmishers advanced bravely, and constantly reinforced, drove back the Hanoverian
and Nassau riflemen in front of the wood. Then Bull's battery of howitzers opened with shell
upon them; and so well were these served that the French skirmishers fell back, hotly pressed
by the First and Second brigade of guards issuing from the chateau. The roar of cannon speedily
extended along both crests; the British aiming at the French columns, the French, who could
see no foes with the exception of the lines of skirmishers, firing upon the British batteries.
The French therefore suffered severely, while the allies, sheltered behind the crest, were
only exposed to the fire of the shot which grazed the ground in front, and then came plunging
in among them.

Prince Jerome, who commanded on Napoleon's left, sent strong columns of support to his skirmishers
acting against the right of the wood of Hougoumont, while Foy's division moved to attack it
in front. In spite of a terrific fire of artillery poured upon them these brave troops moved
on, supported by the concentrated fire of their powerful artillery against the British position.
The light companies of the guards, after an obstinate resistance, were forced back through
the wood. The French pushed on through the trees until they reached the hedge, which seemed
to them to be the only defense of the buildings. But thirty yards in the rear was the orchard
wall, flanked on the right by the low brick terraces of the garden. The whole of these had
been carefully loopholed, and so terrible a storm of fire opened upon the French that they
recoiled and sought shelter among the trees and ditches in the rear.

Jerome, seeing that his skirmishers had won the wood, and knowing nothing of the formidable
defenses that arrested their advance, poured fresh masses of men down to their assistance.
Although they suffered terribly from the British artillery fire, they gathered in the wood
in such numbers that they gradually drove back the defenders into the buildings and yard, and
completely surrounded the chateau. The defenders had not even time properly to barricade the
gate. This was burst open and dense masses rushed in. The guards met them with the bayonet,
and after fierce fighting drove thorn out and closed the gate again, and with their musketry
fire compelled them to fall back from the buildings. Some of the French, however, advanced
higher up the slope, and opened fire upon one of the batteries with such effect that it had
to withdraw. Four fresh companies of the guards advanced against them, cleared them away, and
reinforced the defenders of the chateau.

A desperate fight raged round the buildings, and one of the enemy's shells falling upon the
chateau set it on fire. But the defense still continued, until Lord Saltoun, repulsing a desperate
attack, and reinforced by two companies which came down the hill to his assistance, drove the
enemy back and recaptured the orchard. This desperate conflict had lasted for three hours.

While it was going on Ney led twenty thousand men against the center and left of the British
position, advancing as usual in heavy column. Just as they were setting out at one o'clock
Napoleon discovered the Prussians advancing.

He sent off a despatch to Grouchy ordering him to move straight upon the field of battle; but
that general did not receive it until seven in the evening, when the fight was nearly over.
It was just two when the columns poured down the hill, their attack heralded by a terrific
fire upon the British line opposed to them. The slaughter among Picton's division was great;
but although the Dutch and Hanoverians were shaken by the iron hail, they stood their ground.
When the columns reached the dip of the valley and began to ascend the slopes toward the British
division they threw out clouds of skirmishers and between these and the light troops of the
allies firing at once began, and increased in volume as the French neared the advanced posts
of La Haye Sainte, Papelotte, and La Haye.

The division of Durette drove out the Nassau troops from Papelotte; but reinforcements arrived
from the British line, and the French in turn were expelled. The other three French columns
advanced steadily, with thirty light guns in the intervals between them. Donzelat's brigade
attacked La Haye Sainte, and, in spite of a gallant resistance by the Germans, made its way
into the orchard and surrounded the inclosures. Another brigade, pushing along on the other
side of the Charleroi road, were met by the fire of two companies of the rifle brigade who
occupied a sandpit there, and by their heavy and accurate fire checked the French advance.
The other two divisions moved straight against that part of the crest held by Picton's division.

The men of the Dutch-Belgian brigade, as soon as fire was opened upon them, lost all order
and took to their heels, amid the yells and execrations of the brigades of Kempt and Pack behind
them, and it was with difficulty that the British soldiers were kept from firing into the fugitives.
The Dutch artillery behind them tried to arrest the mob; but nothing could stop them--they
fairly ran over guns, men, and horses, rushed down the valley and through the village of Mount
St. Jean, and were not seen again in the field during the rest of the day. Picton's division
was now left alone to bear the brunt of the Frenoh attack. The battle at Quatre Bras had terribly
thinned its ranks, and the two brigades together did not muster more than three thousand men.
Picton formed the whole in line, and prepared to resist the charge of thirteen thousand infantry,
beside heavy masses of cavalry, who were pressing forward, having in spite of a stout resistance
driven in the riflemen from the sandpit and the road above it. As the columns neared the British
line the fire from the French batteries suddenly ceased, their own troops now serving as a
screen to the British. The heads of the columns halted and began to deploy into line; Picton
seized the moment, and shouted "A volley, and then charge!"

The French were but thirty yards away. A tremendous volley was poured into them, and then the
British with a shout rushed forward, scrambled through a double hedgerow that separated them
from the French, and fell upon them with the bayonet. The charge was irresistible. Taken in
the act of deploying, the very numbers of the French told against them, and they were borne
down the slope in confusion. Picton, struck by a musket ball in the head, fell dead, and Kempt
assumed the command, and his brigade followed up the attack and continued to drive the enemy
down the hill. In the meantime the French cavalry were approaching. The cuirassiers had passed
La Haye Sainte, and almost cut to pieces a Hanoverian battalion which was advancing to reinforce
the defenders.

These regiments had fared, however, better than the Greys, Royals, and Inniskillens on the
left, for they, having encountered no infantry fire, had charged up the hill until level with
the French guns, when, turning sharp to the left, they swept along the line cutting up the
artillerymen, until suddenly they were charged by a brigade of lancers, while a large body
of infantry threatened their line of retreat. Fortunately at this moment the light cavalry
came up to their assistance.

Riding right through the infantry column the light cavalry fell upon the French lancers and
rolled them over with the fury of their charge, and then charged another regiment of lancers
and checked their advance. Light and heavy horse were now mixed up together, and a fresh body
of French cavalry coming up, drove them down the hill with great loss--they being saved, indeed,
from total destruction by the Eleventh Hussars, who, coming up last, had kept their formation.
Covered by these the remnants of the cavalry regained their own crest on the hill, and reformed
under cover of the infantry. General Ponsonby was killed, and his brother, the colonel of the
Twelfth, severely wounded and left on the field.

While this desperate fight had been raging on the center and left, fresh columns had advanced
from Jerome's and Foy's divisions against Hougoumont, and had again, after obstinate fighting,
captured the orchard and surrounded the chateau, but were once more repulsed by a fresh battalion
of guards who moved down the slope to the assistance of their hardly-pressed comrades. Then
for a while the fighting slackened, but the artillery duel raged as fiercely as ever. The gunners
on both sides had now got the exact range, and the carnage was terrible. The French shells
again set Hougoumont on fire, and all the badly wounded who had been carried inside perished
in the flames.

At the end of an hour fresh columns of attack moved against the chateau, while at the same
moment forty squadrons of cavalry advanced across the valley toward the English position.

The English batteries played upon them with round shot, and, as they came near, with grape
and canister; but the horsemen rode on, and at a steady trot arrived within forty yards of
the English squares, when with a shout they galloped forward, and in a moment the whole of
the advanced batteries of the allies were in their possession; for Wellington's orders had
been that the artillerymen should stand to their guns till the last moment, and then run for
shelter behind the squares. The French cavalry paused for a moment in astonishment at the sight
that met their eyes. They had believed that the British were broken and disorganized, but no
sooner had they passed over the slope than they saw the British and German squares bristling
with bayonets and standing calm and immovable.

The artillery on both sides had ceased their fire, and a dead silence had succeeded the terrible
din that had raged but a moment before. Then with a shout the cavalry again charged, but in
no case did they dash against the hedges of bayonets, from which a storm of fire was now pouring.
Breaking into squadrons they rode through the intervals between the squares and completely
enveloped them; but Lord Uxbridge gathered the remains of the British cavalry together, charged
them, and drove them back through the squares and down the hill. Receiving reinforcements the
French again advanced, again enveloped the squares, and were again hurled back.

While this was going on the battle was still raging round Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte, against
which a portion of Reille's division had advanced; but the Germans resisted as obstinately
as did the guards, and as the French cavalry retired for the second time the infantry fell
back, and for a time the slope of the English position was again clear of the enemy.

For a time the battle languished, and then Napoleon brought up thirty-seven fresh squadrons
of cavalry, and these, with the remains of those who had before charged, rode up the slope.
But although they swept on and passed the British squares, they could not succeed in shaking
them. A body of horse, however, sweeping down toward the Dutch and Belgians at the end of the
line, these at once marched off the field without firing a musket, and the brigade of cavalry
with them galloped away at full speed.

The position was a singular one; and had Napoleon ordered his infantry to advance in the rear
of the cavalry, the issue of the day might have been changed. In appearance the French were
masters of the position. Their masses of cavalry hid the British squares from sight. The British
cavalry were too weak to charge, and most of the guns were in the possession of the French;
but the latter's infantry were far away, and after sustaining the fire of the squares for a
long time, the cavalry began to draw off. Lord Uxbridge now endeavored to persuade the Cumberland
Hanoverian Hussars, who had not so far been engaged, to charge; but instead of obeying orders
they turned and rode off, and never drew bridle until they reached Brussels, where they reported
that the British army had been destroyed.

Adams' brigade were now brought up from the reserve, and drove back the French infantry and
cavalry who had come up to the top of the crest beyond Hougoumont. On the other side Ney sent
a column against La Haye Sainte. The Germans made a gallant stand; but they were cut off from
all assistance, outnumbered, and were altogether without ammunition; and although they defended
themselves with their bayonets to the end, they were slain almost to a man, and La Haye Sainte
was captured at last. But beyond this the French could not advance; and though column after
column moved forward to the attack on the crest, they were each and all beaten back.

It was now nearly seven o'clock in the evening, and the Prussians were engaged at St. Lambert,
Napoleon having detached Lobau's corps to arrest their progress. Their march had been a terrible
one. They had to traverse country roads softened by the rain; the men were up to their ankles
in mud, guns and carriages stuck fast, and it was not until after tremendous efforts that the
leading squadron of their cavalry passed through the wood of Wavre and came in view of the
battle that was raging. It was then past four o'clock, and another hour passed before any considerable
number of infantry arrived. It was at this time Napoleon sent Lobau against them. He was able
for a time to resist their advance; but as fresh troops came up from the rear the Prussians
began to win their way forward, and Napoleon was obliged to send two more divisions of the
Young Guard to check them.

He now saw that all was lost unless he could, before the whole of the Prussian army arrived,
break down the resistance of the British. He therefore prepared for a final effort. Ney was
to collect all his infantry, and, advancing past La Haye Sainte, to fall upon the center of
the British line. The guard, who had hitherto been held in reserve, was to pass Hougoumont
and attack the left center. The cavalry were to follow in support.

A cannonade even more heavy and terrible than before, for the guns of the reserve had been
brought up, opened upon the British, and the squares were now melting away fast. But no reinforcements
could be sent to them, for the whole of the British troops were now in action, and their allies
had for the most part long before left the field.

Every gun was brought to the front, the remains of the cavalry gathered together as a reserve;
and some of the Prussians now approaching the left, the cavalry there were brought to the center
to aid in the defense of the threatened point. T were however were three of us were for itself

 Still the guard pressed on
until they reached the top of the crest; and then the British guards leaped to their feet and
poured in a tremendous volley at close quarters, fell on the flank of the column, broke it,
and hurled it down the hill.

The guards were recalled and prepared to oppose the second column, but their aid was not needed;
the Fifty-second threw themselves upon its flank, the Seventy-first and Ninety-fifth swept
its head with their volleys, and as the column broke and retired the Duke of Wellington gave
the orders the men had been longing for since the fight began. The squares broke into lines,
and the British, cheering wildly, descended the crest. The French retreat became a rout, cavalry
and infantry fell upon them, the artillery plied them with their fire, the Prussians poured
down upon their flank. By eight o'clock the splendid army of Napoleon was a mass of disorganized
fugitives.

For ten hours the battle had raged. To the men in the squares it seemed a lifetime. "When shall
we get at them? when shall we get at them?" was their constant cry as the round shot swept
their ranks, although from their position behind the crest they could see nothing of their
enemies. Nothing is harder than to suffer in inactivity, and the efforts of the officers were
principally directed to appeasing the impatience of their men, "Our turn will come presently,
lads." "Yes, but who will be alive when it does come?" a query which was very hard to answer,
as hour by hour the ranks melted away. Although they kept a cheerful countenance and spoke
hopefully to the men, it seemed to the officers themselves that the prospect was well-nigh
hopeless. Picton's brigade mustered scarce half their strength when the battle began. They
were to have fought in the second line this day; but the defection of their allies in front
of them had placed them in the front, and upon them and upon the defenders of Hougoumont the
brunt of the battle had fallen, and as the squares grew smaller and smaller it seemed even
to the officers that the end must come before long.

"This cannot last," Captain O'Connor said to Ralph when the day was but half over. "They will
never beat us, but by the time they get here there will be nobody left to beat. I don't think
we are more than two hundred strong now, and every minute the force is diminishing. I don't
wonder the men are impatient. We bargained for fighting, but I never reckoned on standing for
hours to be shot at without even a chance to reply."

It was just after this that the French cavalry burst upon the squares; but this cheered rather
than depressed the spirits of the men. For a time they were free from the artillery fire, and
now had a chance of active work. Thus as the fire flashed from the faces of the square the
men laughed and joked, and it was with regret that they saw the cuirassiers fall back before
the charge of Lord Uxbridge's cavalry, for they knew that the moment this screen was removed
the French artillery would open again.

Ralph's chief sensation was that of wonder that he was alive; so overwhelming was the din,
so incessant the rain of shot, it seemed to him a marvel how any one could remain alive within
its range.

Almost mechanically he repeated the orders, "Close up, close up!" as the square dwindled and
dwindled. He longed as impatiently as the men for the advance, and would have gladly charged
against impossible odds rather than remain immovable under fire. When the order at length came
he did not hear it. Just after the storm of fire that heralded the advance of the guards broke
out, a round shot struck him high up on the left arm. He was conscious only of a dull, numbing
sensation, and after that knew no more of what was taking place.

It was pitch dark before he became conscious. Fires were burning at various points along the
ridge; for when the victory was complete the British retired to the position they had held
so long, and the Prussian cavalry took up the pursuit. Fires had been lighted with broken gun
carriages and shattered artillery wagons, and parties with torches were collecting the wounded.
Ralph found that his head was being supported, and that a hand was pouring spirits and water
down his throat. The hand was a shaky one, and its owner was crying loudly. As he opened his
eyes the man broke into a torrent of thankful exclamations.

"The Lord be praised, Mr. Conway. Sure, I thought you were dead and kilt entirely."

"Is that you, Denis?"

"Sure and it's no one else, your honor."

"Is the battle over?"

"It is that. The French are miles away, and the Proosians at their heels."

"What has happened to me, Denis?"

"Well, your honor's hurt a bit in the arm, but it will all come right presently."

It was well for Ralph that he had been struck before the order came for the advance, for as
he fell the one surviving surgeon of the regiment had at once attended to him, had fixed a
tourniquet on the stump of his arm, tied the arteries, and roughly bandaged it. Had he not
been instantly seen to he would have bled to death in a few minutes.

Denis now called to one of the parties who were moving about with stretchers. Ralph was lifted
on to it and carried to the village of Waterloo where he was placed in an ambulance wagon which,
as soon as it was full, started for Brussels.

The fighting was now over, and Denis asked leave to accompany his master. The rout of the enemy
had been so thorough and complete that it was not thought probable any serious resistance could
be offered to the advance of the allied armies to Paris, and he therefore obtained leave without
difficulty to remain with his master. Ralph suffered from exhaustion rather than pain on the
journey to Brussels, and several times became almost unconscious. At four o'clock in the morning
the ambulance stopped at a handsome house that its owner had placed at the disposal of the
authorities for the use of wounded officers. He was carried upstairs and placed in bed in a
room on the second story. Denis at once proceeded to install himself there. He brought down
a mattress from a room above, laid it in the corner, throwing his greatcoat over it, then as
soon as he thought the shops were open he hurried out and bought a kettle and saucepan, two
cups and tumblers, a small basin, and several other articles.

"There, your honor," he said as he returned. "Now we have got iverything we need, and I can
make soups and drinks for your honor, and boil myself a tater widout having to go hunting all
over the house for the things to do it with."

A few minutes later two surgeons entered the room and examined Ralph's arm. They agreed at
once that it was necessary to amputate it three inches higher up, Ralph winced when he heard
the news.

"It won't hurt you very much," one of the surgeons said. "The nerves are all numbed with the
shock they have had, but it is absolutely necessary in order that a neat stump may be made
of it. The bone is all projecting now; and even if the wound healed over, which I don't think
it would, you would have trouble with it all your life."

"Of course if it must be done, it must," Ralph said. "There isn't much left of it now."

"There is not enough to be of much use," the surgeon agreed; "but even a shorter stump that
you can fit appliances on to will be a great deal more handy than one with which nothing can
be done."

The operation was performed at once, and although Ralph had to press his lips hard together
to prevent himself from crying out, he did find it less painful than he had expected.

"There, you will do now," the surgeon said. Period, possibility, or improbably fond there wainscoting

 Denis Mulligan, you ought to be ashamed of yourself--slaping
like a pig in a stye, with your master laying wounded there beside you, and no one to look
after him. I just laid down for five minutes' nap, your honor, seeing that you had gone off
into a beautiful sleep, and never dreamed of more than that."

"It was the best thing you could do, Denis. You had been twenty-four hours on your feet, and
you would have been fit for nothing if you hadn't had a good rest. Now go downstairs and get
your dinner, and when you come back again you can bring me up a basin of broth and a piece
of bread. I begin to feel hungry; and that's a capital sign, I believe."

When Ralph had finished his broth he said to Denis, "I shan't want anything now for some time,
Denis. You can put a glass of lemonade within reach of my hand, and then I shall do very well
for an hour or two. I am quite sure you must be dying for a pipe; so go out and take a turn.
It will freshen you up; and you can bring me back what news you can gather as to the losses
yesterday, and whether the army started in pursuit of the French."

It was some time before Denis would consent to leave the room; but at last, seeing that Ralph
really wished it, he went out for an hour, and returned full of the rumors he had picked up
of the terrible losses of the British, and the utter rout of the French army. The next morning
Ralph had a great surprise; for just as he had finished his breakfast there was a tap at the
door, and a lady entered. Ralph could hardly believe his eyes as his mother ran forward to
the bed. But the pressure of her arms and her kisses soon showed him that it was a reality.

"Why, mother darling!" he exclaimed, "how on earth did you get here?"

"I came across in a smack to Ostend, Ralph, and then came on by carriage. I got here last night,
and learned at the quartermaster-general's office that you were wounded and were somewhere
in Brussels, at least they believed you were here somewhere, but they could not say where.
They let me have a copy of the list of the houses that had been allotted for the use of wounded
officers. It was too late to begin the search last night, but I have been three hours going
round this morning. I saw the surgeon downstairs and he told me--" and her lips quivered and
her eyes filled with tears.

"That I had lost my left arm, mother. Well, that is nothing to fret about when thousands have
been killed. One can do very well without a left arm; and I think, on the whole, that I have
been wonderfully lucky. Denis!" But Denis was not in the room, having, as soon as he had discovered
who Ralph's visitor was, gone out to leave them alone. "And have you made this journey all
by yourself, mother?"

"No, my dear. Mr. Tallboys was good enough to come over to take care of me by the way."

"Mr. Tallboys, mother! How did he know that you were coming?"

"Well, I told him, Ralph. But that is a long story, and you shall hear it another day. The
doctor said you had better not do much talking now. Mr. Tallboys will stay here a day or two
and then go home. I intend to take a room somewhere close by and install myself here as your
head nurse."

"I shan't want much nursing, mother; but I shall be delighted to have you with me. I have a
capital servant. The man I told you about in my letters. He is a most amusing fellow and very
much attached to me. Do you know, he got leave directly the battle was over, and was all night
walking by the side of the ambulance wagon. He is a capital fellow. By the way, mother, I suppose
the will has not turned up yet? You said in your last letter you had great hopes of its being
found."

"It has been found, Ralph; and it is all just as we supposed. But how it was found, or anything
about it, you mustn't ask at present. It is a long story, and I must insist now that you lie
quiet and go to sleep."

"Well, I will try, mother. Will you just look outside the door and see if Denis is there? Denis,
this is my mother," he said as the soldier came in. "She has come over to help nurse me; and
as she will be principally with me in the daytime, you will be at liberty to be out whenever
you like."

"Sure, and I am glad the lady has come, Mr. Conway; though I would have done the best I could
for you. Still, a man is but a poor crater in a sick-room. Can I get you anything ma'am?"

"Well, I have had nothing this morning, Denis; and if you could get me a cup of tea and some
bread and butter, if it is not against the rules, I should be very glad."

"Sure, I will do that, ma'am, with the greatest pleasure in life," Denis said; and presently
returned bringing up a tray with tea, bread and butter, and a plate of cold meat.

"Is there anything else, ma'am?"

"Well, Denis, I should be very much obliged if you will take a note from me to a gentleman
named Tallboys, whom you will find at the Hotel de L'Europe. Give it to him yourself if you
can. He will be glad to hear from you about my son, how he is going on and so on."

For the next few days Ralph's arm was exceedingly painful, attended by a certain amount of
fever. At the end of that time he began to improve, and his wound made steady progress toward
recovery. After staying for four days at Brussels, Mr. Tallboys had returned home. Mrs. Conway
and Denis divided the nursing between them, sitting up on alternate nights.

A fortnight after Mrs. Conway's arrival Ralph said, "Now, mother, I shall be up to-morrow and
can therefore be considered as fairly convalescent, so there can be no reason now why you should
not tell the story about the finding of the will. You told me in one of your letters before
Christmas that Mr. Tallboys had failed altogether. So how did it come to be found?"

Mrs. Conway thereupon told the story. When she came to the point where she had gone as a servant
to the Hall, Ralph interrupted her with a loud protest. "I don't like that, mother; I don't
like the idea of your having gone as a servant, whatever the stake was. If I had been at home
and had known it, I certainly would not have let you go, not if there had been ten fortunes
to be gained by it. The idea of your having to go and live as a servant, and work for people
like that is horrid!"

"There was nothing very unpleasant about it, Ralph. I had plenty to do and to think about,
and the time passed a great deal more rapidly than it would have done if I had been staying
at home all by myself. It would have been very lonely and dull then; and I can assure you that
I considered it no hardship at all being at the Hall. But you must not interrupt me in my story.
If you do I shall tell you nothing more about it until you get home to England."

This threat effectually sealed Ralph's lips, and beyond occasional exclamations he said nothing
until the story was ended.

"Well, it's all very wonderful, mother," he said; "and I should never have thought for a moment
that you were so brave, and could have put things together like that, and could have carried
out such a scheme. But I am awfully glad you have succeeded; because you had set your mind
on it, and the money will I hope make you quite comfortable. How much was it after all mother?
You never told me that."

The lawyer has placed all the deeds and documents relating to Mr. Penfold's property in my
hands, and, as I was of course before well aware, my late client died worth a very considerable
property in addition to his large estates in this country. For the last twenty years his income
has exceeded his expenditure by an average of three thousand a year, and as the surpluses have
been judiciously invested, and as the prices of all funds and stocks now stand vastly higher
than they did during the course of the long war, their total value now amounts to something
over a hundred and thirty thousand pounds.

"The property in this country was valued, at the time Mr. Penfold drew up his will, at eighty
thousand pounds; these estates he left to your son, and the sum of eighty-thousand pounds,
in various investments, to Miss Withers, and directed that the residue, whatever it might be
at his death, should be equally divided between them. Your son's share, therefore, will amount
to about twenty-five thousand pounds. I may say that the outlying farms, which were settled
by deed as a security for the four hundred pounds annually paid to you, are not included in
the above valuation, but are ordered to revert to the main estate upon your decease.

"The formalities will all be completed in the course of a short time. I may say that from the
totals to be divided must be deducted the legacy duties, which, as your son and Miss Withers
are strangers by blood to the testator, will be heavy." Mr. Tallboys added that he heard the
younger Miss Penfold was now recovering from her serious illness, but it was not probable she
would ever be again herself. He had received, he said, a letter that morning from their solicitor,
saying that as soon as Miss Eleanor Penfold could be moved, which it was hoped would be in
the course of another week, the ladies would vacate possession of the Hall.

A fortnight later Mrs. Conway and Ralph left Dover for London, leaving orders with an agent
to sell the furniture of their house. All Ralph's old friends on the shore had been made happy
with handsome presents. After a short stay in London they went down, and Ralph took possession
of the Hall. He soon found there was abundance of occupation for his time on the estate, and
that this would be increased when, as would doubtless be the case, he was placed on the Commission
of Peace for the county, as Herbert Penfold had been before him.

As soon as Ralph had completely recovered his health and strength he told his mother that she
must spare him for a week, as he had promised that he would on the first opportunity go over
to Dunkirk to see his friend Jacques.

He crossed by the packet from Dover to Calais, and thence by coach to Dunkirk. Here he inquired
among the fishermen for Jacques, and found that he had returned before Napoleon broke out from
Elba, and that he was owner of a fishing smack which was now at sea. The next day Jacques returned,
and his delight at meeting Ralph was unbounded. He took him home to his neat cottage where
his pretty young wife was already installed. Ralph remained two days with him, and obtained
a promise from him that he would once a year sail over to Weymouth and pay him a visit.

"I am a rich man, Jacques, now. At present I see you want nothing, but should any accident
befall your fishing boat, or you have need for money for any other cause, write to me, and
the money for a new boat or for any other purpose shall be yours at once. I could afford to
give you a hundred boats without hurting myself, so do not hesitate for a moment in letting
me know if I can help you. It will be a real pleasure to me to do so."

Jacques kept his promise, and never missed coming over once year to pay Ralph a visit, and
as his five sons one after another grew up to be able to manage boats for themselves, they
were each presented one by Ralph. Jacques himself prospered as a fisherman, and never required
the assistance Ralph would have been glad to give him.

Neither Ralph nor Mabel Withers was informed of the expression of Mr. Penfold's hopes in his
will that they would some day be married, the two mothers agreeing cordially that nothing was
so likely to defeat the carrying out of Mr. Penfold's wishes as for the young people to have
any suspicions of them. They were still but boy and girl, and were now perfectly happy in their
unrestrained intercourse, for not a day passed that the two families did not see something
of each other; but had they had a suspicion of the truth it would have rendered them shy and
awkward with each other, and have thrown them much more widely apart.

"We both hope that it will come about, Mrs. Conway," Mrs. Withers said one day; "and I certainly
think there is every prospect of it. Let us leave well alone, and allow it to come about naturally
and without interference."

As soon as Ralph left the army he purchased Denis Mulligan's discharge, and the Irishman was
installed as butler and Ralph's special servant at the Hall, and remained in his service to
the end of his life. In due time the natural change in the relations between the two young
people came about, and their youthful friendship ripened into love. When Ralph was twenty-three,
and Mabel had just come of age, she changed her name and took up her place at the Hall, Mrs.
Conway gladly handing over the reins of government to her. She herself lived with her children,
for she was almost as fond of Mabel as of Ralph, to the end of a long life; and deep was the
regret among her children and grandchildren when she was at last laid in Bilston Church, close
to the resting-place of Herbert Penfold.
