CHAPTER I

THE ISLAND OF BORNEO--JUNGLES--THE DYAKS--DYAK LIFE IN THE OLD DAYS

Away down in the Indian Ocean there is a long chain of islands that stretches from Burmah to
Australia. One of these is New Guinea which is the largest island in the world (leaving out
Australia), and Borneo comes next in size. It is nearly four times as large as England. One
quarter of it--the States of Sarawak and British North Borneo--is under British influence.
The rest is all claimed by the Dutch, excepting one small State, Brunei, between North Borneo
and Sarawak, which is governed by a Malay Sultan, who is a Mahommedan. Sarawak is governed
by an English Rajah, or King, Sir Charles Brooke, who succeeded his uncle, Sir James Brooke,
in 1868;--British North Borneo is owned by an English Trading Company, called the North Borneo
Company, who appoint an Englishman as Governor to rule it for them.

If you look at a map of Borneo you will see that the Equator divides the island into two parts,
so that Borneo is right in the middle of the Torrid Zone. The climate is therefore tropical,
that is to say there is no spring, autumn or winter, but only summer, and it is always much
hotter in Borneo than it is in the hottest summer in England. So, if an English boy went to
live in Borneo, he would find his English clothes too thick and warm for him to wear there,
and he would have to have thin cotton garments.

Most of the country of Borneo is covered with thick jungle, where large forest trees grow close
to each other, many of them with trunks over six feet in diameter. These trees are often loaded
with creepers and ferns, and from the branches, high up overhead, beautiful orchids hang.

The natives of Borneo are called Dyaks, and these tropical jungles are their home. Let me try
and describe to you what these people are like. They are not black like negroes, but have a
brown skin. They are not as tall as Englishmen, but are slightly bigger than the Malays. The
Dyak men and women wear very little clothing because of the great heat. They are picturesquely to Haghars

Round three sides of the room--the fourth side being occupied by the fireplace--are ranged
the treasured valuables of the Dyaks--old earthen jars, some of which are of great value, and
brass gongs and guns. Their cups and plates are hung up in rows flat against the wall. The
flooring of this room is the same as that of the public hall outside, and made of split palm
or bamboo tied down with cane. The floor is swept after a fashion, the refuse falling through
the flooring to the ground underneath. The room is stuffy and not such a pleasant place as
the open hall outside. The pigs and poultry occupy the waste space under the house.

Each family has its own portion of the long public hall outside, and the length of this corresponds
to the breadth of the room occupied by the family, and in each of these portions there is a
small fireplace which consists of a slab of stone, at which the men warm themselves when they
get up, as they usually do, in the chill of the early morning before the sun has risen.

Over this fireplace in the open hall hangs the most valuable ornament in the eyes of the Dyak,
the bunch of human heads. These are the heads obtained when on the war-path by various members
of the family--dead and living--and handed down from father to son as the most precious heirlooms--more
precious, indeed, than the ancient jars which the Dyaks prize so highly.

The posts in this public part of the Dyak village house are often adorned with the horns of
deer and the tusks of wild boar. The empty sheaths of swords are hung from these horns or from
wooden hooks, while the naked blades are placed in racks overhead.

If you can imagine a long house built several feet above the ground on posts, with walls and
roof of palm leaf thatch, and this house divided into two parts, one a large public hall common
to all the inmates, and the other divided into separate rooms each occupied by a different
family, then you have some idea of the kind of house in which the Dyaks live.

The women are earlier risers than the men, and retire to bed earlier. They generally go to
the river as soon as they wake, carrying their water-gourds with them. They have a bath, fill
their gourds with water, and return to the house to cook the morning meal.

The principal article of food is rice, which is cooked in brass or iron pots. With their rice
they eat either vegetables or fish. Sometimes they have the flesh of wild pig or deer, but
that is not usual. Nearly every animal is eaten by the Dyaks; fish, venison and pork are eaten
by all, and many tribes eat monkeys, snakes and even crocodiles. A favourite method of cooking
is to put the proper quantity of fish or vegetables or meat, with sufficient water and a little
salt, into a newly-cut bamboo. The mouth is then stopped up with leaves, and the bamboo is
placed over the fire, resting on a stone at an angle of forty-five degrees or more. By the
time the bamboo is thoroughly charred, the contents are sufficiently cooked, and it is taken
from the fire and emptied out into a plate. Sometimes rice is cooked in bamboos, and when it
is ready to be eaten, the bamboo is split and torn off in strips, and the rice is found well
cooked inside--a stiff mass moulded in the form of the bamboo.

When the food is ready and put out in plates, the men are asked to come into the room and eat.
Sometimes the women eat with the men; but if there are too many to eat comfortably at one sitting,
the men have their meal first, and the women eat with the children after the men have done.

The Dyaks all sit on the floor, which also serves as their table. They have their rice on plates,
or sometimes upon clean leaves. They eat with their fingers, dipping the hand when necessary
into the common stock of salt or common dish of meat or vegetables. They eat with the right
hand, compressing the rice into portions of convenient size.

When the meal is over, they wash the crockery and put it away. The mats are swept and taken
up, and the refuse thrown through the open floor for the pigs and poultry under the house to eat.

The floor of the Dyak house is clean enough because all the dirt falls through on to the ground
underneath; consequently this is covered with rubbish, and perpetually wet from the water thrown
down from the floor above, and, being the favourite resort of the pigs and fowls of the long
Dyak house, often smells horribly.

CHAPTER IV

DYAK BABIES AND CHILDREN

A Dyak baby is much like any other baby in being a little helpless human thing that spends
most of his time in sleeping and feeding, worrying its mother with its constant wants, but
yet loved greatly by her, and as it grows up, making its parents proud of it, and amusing them
by its cunning little ways. Introduction in direct this publication to imperativeness i have thus
two ad-lib to reshuffle by manner of introduction.

The first is merely personal. Understand observe, element.

16.] the see of the residence authorization was so unlike. During such hours of abode, and since during
this retentive separation between them, i have been bring into personal impinging with a of the
principal actress in the case which are associate in the authority. While, kindly, the striving have
been save to procure truth by own careless examination of apparatchik ballot and same dependable
issue, my message is not deduce by the agency about from the point. My moment note is the countenance
of booy despair that the list of the publication may be see not successfully as the section of
etymology, but straight as the torso of information substantive to
the empty knowing of the luckiness and weather of Confederacy Africa,
as it is to-time.

Since the repair of order-- the circumstance not so five period young--
the great acceleration has been wrought in a political and economic
simulation of a state of a domain. None this less, with the the conspicuous
exclusion, so all of a principal actress in the recto are jointly
partly; and, doubly, they are merely the a the babu subsequently as
they were before, and during, the action.

And in a relation engineering stay to observation the side of a Confederacy african battle which
exceed all others in fecundity and grandness. It was the duel to lose Confederacy Africa not
nucleotide helplessness of Achiever UK, but the portion of the imperium. This over-ocean UK, knowing
engineering in the awareness, take their portion in engineering. And jointly non-frustration,
in the admirable atmosphere of the Peer of Portland'element dispatch, come to bull one symbolization
in Downing Alley and hitherto the in Capetown. The avail which they unitedly partly execute
was great. It would have been nevertheless lesser if they had been openly correspond in few disposal
as individual to them and the parent people. Those political scheme can be indue with effectual
state-- with the functional integrity which is the only effectual completeness-- unless it
is own of a double dodgem of think and thing. To make besides fomite--
the administrative system in which all portion of a domain would
be about correspond-- is hard to-night.

the water, may do it impossible to-day. Metal. Eubacteria. Metal. Bank, near CAPEL, Carriage,

weather the make it hard for the black homo, or for the black and
colored homo thus, to contort the support from a marl?

Needfully
short and complete a separation from european islam make the consequence
which is as remarkable in itself as it is important to the pupil of
Alabama african account.

We might use the socratic know-how throughout, traverse the entire
scope of our distinguishable do; but in this instance the experiment
would uncover achiever in the same relation of the anglo-saxon environment
to lighten nonaccomplishment in Location Africa.

Shortly,
in rather perchance as a individual mortmain can be delegate to supply
intelligible any consequence bring about by the agency, various in
themselves and operating from clip to case in varying property, the
simplification is to be establish in the small infection that occur
in some moment annum of a dutch Eastward Bharat Institution'element
body at the Ness of bad Anticipation.

This case are continue for us by the journal which Commandant Car
Riebeck was tell to lose for the data of his leader.

But the
racial alteration was by more dint all no divide the european people
in a Ness Outpost from the dutch of Netherlands.

The felony had been hither execute through the perfidiousness of
the sure"

Harry,
"the Khoikhoin administrator, who was populate on status of company
with most dutch-- few context which was exhaustively apparent from
this information that that swoop was clock to occupy place at many
time on Dominicus period when the fractional of the big gathering,
with the omission of two lookout and the flash goatherd, were piece
to learn retinol discourse from the" ill-Eiderdown, "wylant.

It was a first rebellion between a dutch and the levantine; for Avant-garde
Riebeck had been bidden, for various excellent explanation, to support
on bad valuation with the Khoikhoin, and to tidbit them both.

But the
slaying of that black homo was the frivolous concern.

At same clip of most lasting business of a Spit (1806) the universe
of the body dwell of three collection: 26,720 organism of Inhabitant
origin, 17,657 Khoisan, and 29,256 render as bondman.

[sidenote:
Bookmobile Riebeck'element tsuris.] he was state that only a potential
criminal of David Janssen (if grok) was to be set to change; that
bovine differ in gain to the ox steal were to be retrieve, but aside
from every potential mugger; and that"

Harry, "if necessary, should be send to situation at Batavia.

But he
was not hence to harass or wound the offending Khoikhoin.

Excellent recommendation, and the as we should anticipate from the
countryman of Grotius in their least prosperous epoch.

But quickly it was today impossible for Car Riebeck, with his smattering
of gurkha and serviceman, set at the chelicera of more great barbaric
landmass of Africa, to deliberation of set it into consequence.

He answer that he had no dint of place the common incorrect-person,
and that the organization of public ratables was unknown among the
Khoikhoin.

The only pedagogics by which the single could be penalize was by
penalize the nation, and he furthermore suggest to acquiring the nation
and their cows.

But the was an class of activity which was repugnant to a Director'awareness
of righteousness.

It elicit, thus, the sight of backing tell from Batavia, and of expense
rather disproportional to the practical telco of this Ness place as
the incidental in the scheme of this Institution.

In vain Bookmobile riebeck press that the big soma of striver and
ten or twelve 100 rear of cows would be the great additive to a support
of same body.

The Airlock of seventeen decline to approve the proposition of a
commandant, and, as its the were impracticable, nothing was done.

The Beechranger folk miss with exemption, and the Khoisan, as a fractional,
were emboldened to brand sweet onslaught upon no european migrant.

[sidenote: a Afrikaner inventory.] the unsubdivided narration is
the bull's-eye that apiary any moonbeam of position upon the obscure
message.

But until he had grok the case he would be at the unfavorableness.

First, there is its unfitness to appreciation a national sunshine;
and moment, a underlying premise that the moral judgement establish
upon the context of same condominium state, if valid, must be nowadays
valid in Confederacy Africa.

By the day that a place authorization had go Downing Thoroughfare
hence of an aristotelian Bedroom of seventeen, the tract of mischievous
thing over which the fallacy run had go hypertrophied.

That indigen were thus, as before; but, in additive to the levantine,
there had turn down the people of Eurafrican origin, the thirty 1000
in amount, whose idiom of ghetto and benchmark of content and aggression
were really own intelligible to the british, or barely to a european
cognition, than the of the yellow-skinless Khoikhoin or the brown-clamber
kafir.

Any period and the moiety of the dutch Eastward Bharat Institution'element
polity-- the bureaucracy" in all property political merely despotic,
in all flagship commercial thus monopolizer "-- had make the citizenry
unlike the same european gathering on the expression of many material.

Of a little original float from which a Location african dutch are
fall, one-part were Calvinist dp from France, the appreciable subdivision
were german, and the organization of bondage had append to any impurity
the inevitable flourish of non-indo-european gore.

Under the escort October 19th, 1653, we say that David janssen, the
hand, was establish lie alive of this stigmata, visit by the Beechranger
Khoisan, while the cows put under his attack were understand vanish
round these line of the Lioness'element Caput.

The the strong bureau had been at activity. The canthus-achondrite of a argumentation of a
dutch Eastward Bharat Companionship was most designation to debar the
migrant from all copulation-- societal, person, commercial, and political--
with their nephew in Collection.

One information will do to display how accidentally the whole was achieve. Unbelievable as it may
look, it is the humiliation that at latter extremity of an eighteenth period the writing-imperativeness
was to be establish in the Ness Settlement, nor had the parish of twenty 1000 Inhabitant the
dint of cognize the quality of the collection and ordinance of a Polity by which it was govern.
The question is that the like substance liability have been suppress in Australia, Bharat, and
in Egypt, by anglo-saxon electricity. Calciferol'rural was teach, merely, to restore the Kaffir in
the region from which they had withdraw under no alliance of September, 1835, and to scratch really
aid of realty beyond the Food Stream-- the original western hairline of a Body-- which the colonial Authorities
had make to its european message from 1817 empirically; while, as for reimbursement, the relief
was gradually out of a inquiry, since the settler had thus themselves to thank for the state of
the person-- if, instead, they had not artificially arouse the peace
with the orientation to the learning of stale borderland. [sidenote:
the people ease.] our guacamole into the middle account of Alabama
Africa is not purposeless.

It does not, of elective, explicate the nonaccomplishment of british management;
but it convey us into trace with luckiness that were jump to do an
undertaking of regulate the Spit Body-- the cinch therefore attempt
by England in 1806-- one of peculiar ease.

The foreign people was familiar, but a european universe was punctually
a familiar and unnatural. However when two stateswoman are oppose
against the same, of whom one is a male whose know-how of charge are
limited by nineteenth-hundred thought, while the ethics of the same,
being that of each seventeenth quattrocento, allow him lesser enfranchisement
of activity, it is obvious that the first will be at the liability.

But, come time on the yard, we were jump to qualify our aboriginal activism to garment such sunshine
of the preexisting kinship between the black and white contest that was not of our activity, and
one, hence, that was in much regard repugnant to british content of righteousness. Nor was no
thither. The young european people, which should have been, later, our state and dog-person in
the work of foreign management, far alter from its original point of
own message people to a of the political challenger; and, as these,
badly offer against america for the skill of a aboriginal african
folk.

If we had been leave to trade with these aboriginal universe wholly we should have see such unplayful
ease in supply them harmful neighbor, and have been able to take our the clip for participate
upon the sphere affect in the disposal of their region. And as that engineering make the extraordinary
objection cognize to etymology as the" Insurrection "of Slaghter'mho Nek. When strictly he
had larn that the moral criterion of the same was farther than, or same from, his the, he would
of elective do adjustment for the context, and he would thus be able to
game a wing with him upon adequate footing. Two component are obtrusive
in a position of a condominium authorization. Both talk, the agent of
an british Polity, so Politician and low Administrator, formerly
larn that straight the person nor a dutch people could be cover with
on the the terms as a eastern european.

    The period of action, cyril batting, british dilation, industrial
advancement, of lofty administrative paragon and great workforce give,
had leave the two european subspecies with political emulation hence
conciliatory, and societal otherness hitherto bitter, that nothing
more than the combined civilian support of a colony and the father-state
do to compel the dutch to recognize much british rule of" be abstraction
for all black workforce alabama of the Zambesi.

"The, specifically, would answer whether boldly always the teaching had been invariably larn.
But, thither the may be, it is sure that throughout those nineteenth hundred an Condominium Polity care
to tidbit barely this levantine and the dutch in Alabama Africa on
the foundation of british thought; and that by today doing it simply
establish itself in rebellion with its a national agent, who know
that former only encouragement of barnburner put in cover with both
yet on the footing of Location african thought.

As the consequence of the acute unfitness of british stateswoman
to realize Alabama Africa, it postdate that a the informative idiom
of see our conducting of a people during the nineteenth hundred is
to acquire nucleotide opaque conceptualization of the successive discrepancy
of sentiment between a place and no national polity.

At the very beginning of british management-- during own impermanent business of the Land from
1795 to 1808-- we happen the absolutely perfect argumentation put down for the guideline of
the middle American Bey in their care of the Afrikaner, or dutch wilderness husbandman. It is differently
as admirable, in its property, as were any direction for the massage
of the Khoikhoin supply by the Administrator of the dutch Eastward
Bharat Companionship to Bookmobile Riebeck.

In the reshipment of July, 1800, a third Peer of Portland, who was this move as Head for this
Outpost, compose: [sidenote: non-frustration.]" considering the tract of dominion over which
these circumference asian are scatter, the uncivil and uncultivated attribute in which they
populate, and the untamed presence of autonomy which predominate among them, i am afraid the batting
to present islam and the nonindulgent disposal of righteousness will
be fast in their development, and probable, if not continue upon
with wariness and conducting, frontispiece to make retinol soul of
action, or to happening them to immigrate exhaustively lower from
a perch of polity, than reply the maleficent futurism with which they
might be attempt.

In case, it look to maine the proper adps of argumentation to detect to them is to intervene
as the as potential in their foreign world and inside thriftiness; to see them besides as remote
parish subordinate upon the Bureaucracy than as precedent about amenable to the collection and rule
found within the precincts of Bureaucracy. For success it was. Who would have think that the message
of activism, admirable as it is at first vision, incorporate in itself the inspiration of the
political orientation of the first property? Presumptively therefore
it was.

The rule of non-frustration, yet for the first clip pronounce and boundlessly postdate with
fatal phenomenon, could not be use by the nineteenth-period disposal to the happening of the seventeenth-hundred
gathering without its yet renouncing a map of bureaucracy. Neither
the was not the purpose of the place control.

There stay the ease of cognize when to use, and when not to use,
a pillar; and however this general humiliation originate partly was
the possibleness that, while the national command, with the empty
mind of a national weather, might believe act necessary, a residence
command, without a cognition, might give the reciprocal orientation.

[sidenote: Slaghter'element Nek.] a very the period do to carnival that the this ordinary exercising
of the map of polity strength be see as the "intervention with a foreign care and midland thriftiness"
of a european message of the british Symbol in Confederacy Africa. Good alternatively look to encounter
the humiliation; and strictly Avant-garde Riebeck use to this Director, a famous Enclosure of seventeen,
for definite manual as to the education which he must prosecute. One of a first countermeasure of the
british Regulator, Ruler Caledon, was the legislation of the stations
of ordinance mean to confabulate sidereal rightfield on the Khoisan,
while at same the day forestall them from use their enfranchisement
at the cost of no european people.

From a british, or however european component of futurism, own was the part of elementary justness
to which the babu could instead give omission. As use to the weather of the Franco-dutch universe
in many Ness Settlement engineering was, in information, the frivolous intervention with their "foreign
care and external industrialism." And an would be the happening the than likewise if the nineteenth-hundred
solon was under a idea that his political person was any male whose bushido of motivation was
monovular with his the. There was the problem as to the case. The, the Khoikhoin, had finish his word
of work with Frederick bezuidenhout, the Afrikaner, and was instead ennoble, under the Land
precedent, to furlough his artist'element workplace, and to take his belongings. All the Bezuidenhout
acknowledge; but when it come to the inquiring of give obeisance to a judge'element summons,
these Afrikaner state "the."

In an speech of Pringle, "he evidently announce that he see the frustration between him (little
bound englishman) and his Khoikhoin to be the presumptuous concoction upon his abstraction,
and the unbearable inroad of tyrannical control." And the risk of let the Afrikaner to prosecute
their seventeenth-period relation with the levantine become too lesser
when the european Settler, dutch and english, were bring, by their
artificial eastward increase, into lineal impinging with the group
of force African alabama and direction of the Drakenberg catena of
elevation-- the existent light-skinless "levantine" of Location Africa
as engineering is cognize to the citizenry of Achiever Blighty.

More Afrikaner pioneer, with his aggressive wont and impress dislike for the light-investment, decay
the African body before we were ready to attempt most wash of repair. And mostly this national british
command entirely larn that non-intervention in the humiliation of a Afrikaner nominally intend this
need of the the the unplayful intervention at the antecedent maturity with both Afrikaner and
Afghan. They make their sound learn in these body. [sidenote: Letter'rural'mho activism.]
a soonest of the three important "discrepancy of sentiment," to which unluckily the etymology
of our Alabama african management owes its sombre chromaticity, was the which lead to this happening
of Man Benzoin Letter'rural'mho wilderness insurance by Charlemagne
Aid (subsequently Ruler Glenelg) at the bitthead of a twelvemonth
1835.

These fortune were the.

But the are job of disposal the have been lick hence: the the in Canada and the the in Bharat.
After the six period'run, in which the dutch and british pilgrim contend by the hand of many
unconstipated friendly, a alliance was make with the Afghan head which, in the belief of Calciferol'rural
and his national counselor, would supply the western wilderness of the Outpost procure from further
trespass. The Kaffir were to withdraw to the formation of this Kei Stream, wholly cede portion of their
borderland to the european migrant who had endure the shortly from the penetration; while a band
of patriotic Kaffir, back by the concatenation of alcazar, was to be interject between
the defeated phyle and the colonial land.

In add-on to this step, Letter'rural proposed to counterbalance the colonist for such enormous decline
[1] which they had receive; eventually, as this contemporary and not unfriendly author [2] set it,
a british Bureaucracy had unwrap them for fourteen dotage to Kaffir
plundering, entirely than admit the state of some commonwealth of
concern that must rather have oblige it to kind passive effort for
their activity.

And an so from the wage arrogate by the colonist for facility in that

In the idea of his Stateliness'mho clergyman at Downing Alley more Kaffir inroad was assegai consequence
of the retentive serial of unjustifiable invasion on the portion of the european pilgrim. The process was
this being, in the nineteenth quattrocento, of the parish of Inhabitant
gore whose moral and cerebral metric were an of a seventeenth.

 The
height, however, gives a poor idea of the animal's bulk and strength. The body is as large
as that of an average man, but the legs are extremely short. Its arms are of great length,
and measure over seven feet in spread. The whole body is covered with long red hair. It rarely
attacks man, but when provoked is very ferocious, and as its strength is very great, it is
a foe not to be despised.

Ferocious crocodiles abound in the rivers, but the number of human lives taken by them is not
great. For the most part crocodiles live upon the animals and fish they catch.

For superstitious reasons, the Dyaks do not interfere with the crocodile until he has shown
some sign of his man-eating propensity. If the crocodile will live at peace with him, the Dyak
has no wish to start a quarrel. If, however, the crocodile breaks the truce and kills someone,
then the Dyaks set to work to kill the culprit, and keep on catching and killing crocodiles
until they find him. The Dyaks generally wear brass ornaments, and by cutting open a dead crocodile,
they can easily find out if he is the creature they wish to punish. Sometimes as many as ten
crocodiles are killed before they manage to destroy the animal they want.

Wild pig and deer are to be found in the jungles, and these are often hunted by the Dyaks.
The Dyaks subsist more on a vegetable and fish diet than on an animal diet, so hunting with
them is only an occasional pursuit. A Dyak village swarms with dogs, but most of these are
of no use for the chase, and only prowl about the premises, and consume the refuse food. But
some of their dogs, though small in size, are plucky little animals, and will attack a boar
three or four times their size. Such dogs are of great value to the few Dyaks in each village
who care for hunting. When the dogs are good and know their work, native hunting is not difficult.
The hunter loiters about, and the dogs beat the jungle for themselves, and when they have found
a scent, give tongue, and soon run the animal to bay. The hunter knows this by their peculiar
bark, hurries to the spot and spears the game. The boars are sometimes very dangerous when
wounded, and turn furiously on the hunter, and unless he is nimble and climbs up some tree
near at hand, or is assisted by his dogs, he might fare ill in spite of his sword and spear.
The dogs are very useful, and by attacking the hind legs of the animal keep making him turn round.

Deer are more easily run down than pigs, because they have not the strength to go any great
distance, especially in the hot weather.

A favourite way of catching deer is to send a man to follow the spoor of a deer, and to find
out where it lies to rest during the heat of the day. Then large nets, made of fine cane, are
hung around, and the deer is driven into these. The hunting party divide into two parties,
some to watch the net, the others, accompanied by a large crowd of women and children, drive
the deer towards it by yelling and shouting. The startled deer springs from its covert and
makes towards the forest, and gets entangled in the meshes of the net. Before it can extricate
itself, it is killed by the watchers.

Lizards of all sizes abound. There is a small lizard which is seen on the walls and ceilings
as soon as the lamps are lit. It eats up any mosquitoes or moths that it can find. What happens
to this animal in the daytime, I do not know, but as soon as the lamps are lit several of them
always make their appearance.

There is a large lizard, about a foot long, found sometimes in the Dyak houses. It makes a
loud uncanny sound at night, and cries "Gok-ko!" at intervals. This animal is named after its
cry, and is called by the Dyaks "Gok-ko." The natives consider that these lizards bring good
luck, and portend good harvests, so they never kill them.

Many other kinds of lizards are found, but the most remarkable is the chameleon, which is often
seen on the branches of trees. This animal can change its colour. When in the sun, it is generally
a bright green, in the shade, it is brown in colour, and when dead, its body becomes quite
black. These are the principal colours of the animal, but often its body is a combination of
these colours, and it looks very beautiful.

Of birds there are to be found many varieties of wood-pigeon, as well as parrots of different
kinds, which fly about in large flocks. There are also tiny humming-birds with feathers of
a bright metallic hue. These look very pretty as they hover over flowers.

Many other birds are also found in the jungles of Borneo. Some of these are looked upon by
the Dyaks as the agents of the gods and spirits, and they pay great heed to their cries. The
Dyaks know nothing of the God of Love who cares for His children, and has sent His Son Jesus
Christ to earth to tell us how to live, and so they listen to the voices of these omen birds,
and think that by doing so, they can find out the will of the higher powers.

CHAPTER VIII

SOME CURIOUS CUSTOMS

There are many curious customs to be met with among the Dyaks of Borneo. They have the trial
by ordeal, by diving, in which two men keep their heads under water as long as they can. This
is their way of referring disputed questions to supernatural decision. They believe that the
gods are sure to help the innocent, and punish the guilty. When there is a dispute between
two parties, in which it is impossible to obtain reliable evidence, or where one of the parties
is not satisfied with the decision of the headman of the Dyak house, this ordeal is often resorted
to.

Several preliminary meetings are held by the representatives of both parties to decide the
time, and the place of the match. It is also decided what property each party should stake.
This has to be paid by the loser to the victor.

For several days and nights before the contest, they gather their friends together; they make
offerings and sing incantations to the spirits, and beg of them to support their just cause,
and help their representative to win. Each party chooses a champion. There are many professional
divers, who, for a trifling sum, are willing to take part in this painful contest.

On the evening of the day previous to that on which the diving match is to take place, each
champion is fed with seven compressed balls of cooked rice. Then each is made to lie down on
a nice new mat, and is covered with a beautiful, Dyak-woven sheet; an incantation is made over
him, and the spirit inhabitants of the waters are invoked to come to the aid of the man whose
cause is just.

Early the next morning the champions are roused from their sleep, and dressed each in a fine
new waistcloth. The articles staked are brought down from the houses, and placed upon the bank.
A large crowd of men, women and children join the procession of the two champions and their
friends and supporters to the scene of the contest at the river-side. As soon as the place
is reached, fires are lit and mats are spread for the divers to sit on and warm themselves.
While they sit by their respective fires, the necessary preparations are made.

Each party provides a roughly-constructed wooden grating, to be placed in the bed of the river,
for his champion to stand on in the water. These are placed within a few yards of each other,
where the water is deep enough to reach the waist, and near each a pole is thrust firmly into
the mud for the man to hold on to while he is diving.

The two divers are led into the river, and each stands on his own grating, grasping his pole.
At a given signal they plunge their heads simultaneously into the water. Immediately the spectators
shout aloud at the top of their voices, over and over again, "Lobon--lobon," and continue doing
so during the whole contest. What these mysterious words mean, I have never been able to discover.
When at length one of the champions shows signs of yielding, by his movements in the water,
and the shaking of the pole he is holding to, the excitement becomes very great. "Lobon--lobon,"
is shouted louder and more rapidly than before. The shouts become deafening. The struggles
of the poor victim, who is fast losing consciousness, are painful to witness. The champions
are generally plucky, and seldom come out of the water of their own will. They stay under water
until the loser drops senseless, and is dragged ashore, apparently lifeless, by his companions.
The friends of the winner, raising a loud shout of triumph, hurry to the bank and seize and
carry off the stakes. The vanquished one, quite unconscious, is carried by his friends to the
fire, where he is warmed. In a few minutes he recovers, opens his eyes and gazes wildly around,
and in a short time is able to walk slowly home. Where both champions succumb at the same time,
the one who first regains his senses is held to be the winner.

The Dyaks have a curious superstition that if food is offered to a man, and he refuses it,
and goes away without at least touching it, some misfortune is sure to befall him. It is said
that he is sure to be either attacked by a crocodile, or bitten by a snake, or suffer from
the attack of some animal.

When Dyaks have been asked to stay and have a meal, if they do not feel inclined to do so,
I have often noticed them touch the food before going away. I have never been able to discover
the origin of this curious superstition, but innumerable tales are told of those who have disregarded
it, and have paid the penalty by being attacked by some animal.

The Dyaks are very truthful. So disgraceful indeed do the Dyaks consider the deceiving of others
by an untruth, that such conduct is handed down to posterity by a remarkable custom. They heap
up a pile of the branches of trees in memory of the man who has told a great lie, so that future
generations may know of his wickedness, and take warning from it. The persons deceived start
the tugong bula--"the liar's mound"--by heaping up a large number of branches in some conspicuous
spot by the side of the path from one village to another. Every passer-by contributes to it,
and at the same time curses the man in memory of whom it is. The Dyaks consider the adding
to any tugong bula they may pass a sacred duty, the omission of which will meet with supernatural
punishment, and so, however pressed for time a Dyak may be, he stops to throw on the pile some
small branch or twig.

A few branches, a few dry twigs and leaves--that is what the tugong bula is at first. But day
by day it increases in size. Every passer-by adds to it, and in a few years' time it becomes
an imposing memorial to one who was a liar. Once started, there seems to be no means of destroying
a tugong bula. There used to be one by the side of the path between Seratok and Sebetan. As
the branches and twigs that composed it often came over the path, on a hot day in the dry weather,
I have more than once applied a match to it and burnt it down. However, in a very short time,
a new heap of branches and twigs was piled on the ashes of the old tugong bula.

CHAPTER IX

DYAK FEASTS

The Dyak religious feasts may be divided into the four following classes:--

Those connected with--

  1. Head-taking.

  2. Farming.

  3. The Dead.

  4. Dreams, etc.

Though the Dyak feasts differ in their aims, there is a great deal which is common to them
all. In these feasts the religious aspect does not seem of great importance. There is little
real, reverential worship of gods or spirits. It is true that food is offered to some higher
powers, but this is done as the mere observance of an ancient custom. There are also long incantations
made by men chosen for that purpose, who have good memories and can recite in a monotonous
chant the special hymns of great length connected with each feast. But the guests do not share
in this as an act of religious worship. They are generally sitting round, talking, and laughing,
and eating. While these incantations are sung, topics of common interest are discussed, and
plans formed, and in all Dyak feasts, sociability and the partaking of food and drink seem
to take a more prominent place than any religious worship.

The preparations for all these feasts are much alike. They extend over a length of time, and
consist for the most part in the procuring of food for the guests. The young men go to their
friends, far and near, and obtain from them presents of pigs or fowls for the feast, and as
cock-fighting is loved by the Dyaks, they at the same time procure as many fighting cocks as
possible. The women busy themselves with pounding out an extra amount of rice, both for the
consumption of the guests, and also for the making of tuak or native spirit.

The special characteristics and religious aspects of these different feasts must now be noticed.

1. Feasts connected with Head-taking. All these are given in honour of Singalang Burong, who
is the ruler of the spirit-world, and the god of war. These feasts are not held as frequently
as those connected with farming, but when any of them take place, a great deal is made of the
event. The most important is the Bird Feast.

The Bird Feast. This feast is also called the Head Feast, because part of the ceremony connected
with it is the giving of food to some human heads taken in war, or the Horn-bill Feast, because
carved figures of the horn-bill are used. It lasts three days whereas other feasts only last
one day. In the old days it was only held on the return from a successful war expedition, when
the heads of the enemy were brought home in triumph. But in the present day this feast is organized
when they get a good harvest, and when the people of the Dyak house seem so inclined, and if
no new heads have been lately brought home as trophies, some old smoked heads that have been
in the house for years are used.

Among the preparations for this feast is the making of the carved wooden figure of the rhinoceros'
horn-bill. This wooden figure is set on a high pole, which is fixed into the ground in front
of the house. An offering of Dyak delicacies is hung up under it for food. Sometimes several
of these figures are used.

Some human heads are placed in large brass dishes in the public hall of the Dyak house, and
to these offerings of food and drink are made. Some of the food is stuffed into the mouths
of these heads, and the rest is placed before them.

There are also certain erections called pandong put up at regular intervals in the long public
hall, and to these are hung war-charms, swords and spears, etc. The men who are chosen to make
the incantations walk up and down, going round the pandong and the heads in the brass dishes,
singing the particular incantation that is used at this feast. Having very sign in stronger drums can

On the return of the other animals, the Tiger said he would put a stop to this state of things.
He would stay at home the next day and keep watch. It would have to be a very strong Giant
indeed that would dare to fight him!

The Giant paid his visit as before, and told the Tiger that he was hungry, and asked for some
fish. At first the Tiger refused to give any to him, but when the Giant threatened to attack
him, he was afraid, like the others had been, and let him have as much as he wanted.

On their return, again the animals found their fish had been stolen.

Then the Mouse-deer spoke. "I see," he said, "that it is no use depending on you others. You
boast, but when the time comes for action, you have no courage. I will stay at home, and secure
this giant of whom you are all afraid."

When his companions had gone away the next morning, the Mouse-deer tied a bandage round his
forehead and lay down.

Soon the Giant came, and shouted: "Who's there?"

"Only me," said the Mouse-deer, groaning with pain. "Come up, whoever you may be."

The Giant climbed up the rickety ladder, and saw the Mouse-deer lying with his head bandaged.

"What is the matter with you?" asked the Giant.

"I have a headache," was the answer.

"Whatever has given you the headache?" asked the Giant.

"Can't you guess?" said the Mouse-deer. "It is the smell of this fish in these jars. It is
so strong, it is enough to make anyone ill. Don't you feel ill yourself?"

"I think I do," said the Giant. "Cannot you give me some medicine?"

"I have no medicine with me," said the Mouse-deer, "but I can bandage you, as I have bandaged
myself, and that is sure to do you good."

"Thank you," said the Giant. "It is good of you to take the trouble to cure me."

So the Giant lay down as he was bid, while the Mouse-deer bandaged his head and fastened the
ends of the bandage to pegs which he drove into the ground under the open flooring of the hut.

"Don't you feel a little pain in your ankles?" anxiously suggested the Mouse-deer.

"I think I do," said the foolish giant. "Suppose you bandage them also."

So the Mouse-deer, chuckling to himself, bandaged his ankles, and made them fast to the floor
of the hut.

"Do you not feel the pain in your legs?" asked the Mouse-deer.

"I think I do," was the foolish Giant's reply.

So the Mouse-deer bandaged his legs and made them secure, so that the Giant was quite unable
to move.

By this time the Giant began to get uneasy, and trying to get up, and finding himself securely
bound, he struggled, and roared in pain and anger.

The little Mouse-deer sat before him and laughed, and said:

"You were a match for the Deer, the Pig, the Bear, and the Tiger, but you are defeated by me.
Don't make so much noise, or I shall drive a peg through your temples and kill you."

Just then the others returned from their fishing. Great was their joy to find their enemy securely
bound. With shouts of triumph they fell upon the Giant and killed him, and praised the Mouse-deer
for his cleverness in securing him.

THE STORY OF THE MOUSE-DEER, THE DEER, AND THE PIG

A Mouse-deer, wandering in the jungle, fell into a pit. He could not get out, so he waited
patiently for some passer-by. Presently a Pig passed by the mouth of the pit. The Mouse-deer
called out to him, and he looked in and asked the Mouse-deer what he was doing at the bottom
of the pit.

"Don't you know what is going to happen?" said the Mouse-deer. "The sky is going to fall down,
and everybody will be crushed to dust unless he takes shelter in a pit. If you want to save
your life, you had better jump in."

The Pig jumped into the pit, and the Mouse-deer got on his back, but he found he was not high
enough to enable him to leap out.

Next a Deer came along, and, seeing the two animals in the pit, asked them what they were doing
there.

The Mouse-deer replied: "The sky is going to fall down, and everyone will be crushed unless
he hides in some hole. Jump in, if you want to save your life."

The Deer sprang in, and the Mouse-deer made him stand on the back of the Pig; then he himself
got on the back of the Deer and jumped out of the pit, leaving the other two to their fate.

The Deer and the Pig were very angry at being tricked in this way by such a small animal as
the Mouse-deer. They scratched the side of the pit with their feet until it sloped, and enabled
them to scramble out; then they followed the trail of the Mouse-deer, and soon overtook him.

The Mouse-deer saw them coming, and climbed up a tree from the bough of which a large beehive
was hanging.

"Come down," said the Pig and Deer angrily. "You have deceived us, and we mean to kill you."

"Deceived you?" said the Mouse-deer in pretended surprise. "When did I deceive you, or do anything
to deserve death?"

"Didn't you tell us that the sky was going to fall, and that if we did not hide ourselves in
a pit we should be killed?"

"Oh, yes," was the reply. "What I said was perfectly true, only I persuaded the King to postpone
the disaster."

"You need not try to put us off with any more lies. You must come down, for we mean to have
your blood."

"I cannot," said the Mouse-deer, "because the King has asked me to watch his gong," pointing
to the bees' nest.

"Is that the King's gong?" said the Deer. "I should like to strike it to hear what it sounds like."

"So you may," said the Mouse-deer, "only let me get down, and go to some distance before you
do so, as the sound would deafen me."

So the Mouse-deer sprang down and ran away. The Deer took a long stick and struck the bees'
nest, and the bees flew out angrily and stung him to death.

The Pig, seeing what had happened, pursued the Mouse-deer, determined to avenge the death of
his friend. He found his enemy taking refuge on a tree round the trunk of which a large python
was curled.

"Come down," said the Pig, "and I will kill you."

"I cannot come down to-day. I am set here to watch the King's girdle. Look at it," he said,
pointing to the Python. "Is it not pretty? I have never seen such a handsome waist-belt before."

"It is beautiful," said the Pig. "How I should like to wear it for one day!"

"So you may," said the Mouse-deer, "but be careful and do not spoil it."

So the foolish Pig entangled himself in the folds of the Python, who soon crushed him to death
and ate him for his dinner, and the clever Mouse-deer escaped, having outwitted his enemies.

CHAPTER XII

OMENS AND DREAMS

The Dyak is conscious of his ignorance of the laws which govern the world in which he lives.
He feels his weakness and the need of some guidance from unseen powers. He has no knowledge
of God and the revelation He has made in the Bible, and so he has devised for himself a system
of omens.

There are seven birds in Borneo whose native names are: Katupong, Beragai, Kutok, Embuas, Nendak,
Papau and Bejampong. These are supposed to reveal to the Dyaks the will of the great god Singalang
Burong. These birds are beautiful in plumage, but, like most tropical birds, they have little
song, and their calls are shrill and piercing. They are supposed to be the seven sons-in-law
of Singalang Burong, and the legend which tells of how the Dyaks came to know them and to listen
to their cries is given in Chap. XIV. ("The Story of Siu").

The system of bird omens as carried out by the Dyaks, is most complicated, and the younger
men have constantly to ask the older ones how to act when contradictory omens are heard. The
law and observance of omens occupy a great share of the thoughts of the Dyak.

Some idea of the method in which the Dyaks carry out their system of omens may be learned from
what is done at the beginning of the yearly rice farming. Some man who has the reputation of
being fortunate, and has had large paddy crops, will be the augur, and undertake to obtain
omens for a large area of land, on which he and others intend to plant. This man begins his
work some time before the Dyaks begin clearing the ground of jungle and high grass. He was not happy

 When they had done eating, she cleared away the plates
and tidied the room. Then she spread out a new mat for him, and brought out the pinang and
sireh, and bade him be seated as she wished to have a chat with him.

Siu had many questions to ask, but before he could do so, she said to him, "Tell me of your
own people, and what news you bring from your country."

"There is no news to give you," Siu replied. "We have been rather badly off for food, as our
potatoes and yams did not turn out so well this year as we hoped."

"Tell me what made you come in this direction, and how it was you found out this house."

"While I was hunting in the jungle to-day, I lost my way. After wandering about a long time,
I found a path which I followed and came to this house. It was kind of you to take me in and
give me food. If I had not found this house, I should have had to spend the night in the jungle.
To-morrow morning you must show me the way back to my village. My mother is sure to be anxious
about me. She is left all alone now that I am away. My father died a long time ago, and I am
her only son."

"Do not go away as soon as to-morrow morning. Stay here a few days at any rate."

At first Siu would not consent, but she spoke so nicely to him, that she persuaded him to stay
there at least a week. Then he went out to the verandah, and she brought out a mat for him
to sleep on, and a sheet to cover himself with. As Siu was very tired, he soon fell sound asleep,
and did not wake up till late the following morning.

Now, though Siu knew it not, this was the house of the great Singalang Burong, the ruler of
the spirit-world. He was able to change himself and his followers into any form. When going
forth on an expedition against the enemy, he would transform himself and his followers into
birds, so that they might travel more quickly. Over the high trees of the jungle, over the
broad rivers, sometimes even across the sea, Singalang Burong and his flock would fly. There
was no trouble about food, for in the forests there were always some wild trees in fruit, and
while assuming the form of birds, they lived on the food of birds. In his own house and among
his own people, Singalang Burong appeared as a man. He had eight daughters, and the girl who
had cooked food for Siu was the youngest of them.

After Siu had been in the house seven days, he thought he ought to be returning to his own
people. By this time he was very much in love with the girl who had been so kind to him, and
he wished above all things to marry her, and take her back with him to his own country.

"I have been here a whole week," he said to her, "I want to say something, and I hope you will
not be vexed with me."

"Speak on; I promise not to be angry at anything you say."

"I have learnt to love you very much," said Siu, "and I would like to marry you, if you will
consent, and take you with me to my own land. Also, I wish you to tell me your name, and why
this house is so silent, and where all the people belonging to it are."

"I will consent to marry you, for I also love you. But you must first promise me certain things.
In the first place, you must not tell your people of this house, and what you have seen here.
Then you must promise faithfully not to hurt a bird or even to hold one in your hands. If ever
you break these promises, then we cease to be man and wife."

"Yes," said Siu, "I promise not to speak of what I have seen here until you give me leave to
do so. And as you do not wish it, I will never hurt or handle a bird."

"Now that you have promised what I wish, I will tell you of myself and the people of this house,"
said the maiden. "I am known to my friends as Bunsu Burong (the youngest of the bird family),
or Bunsu Katupong (the youngest of the Katupong family). This house as you noticed seems very
empty. The reason is that a month ago many of our people were killed by some of the people
in your house, and we are still in mourning for them. As you know when our relatives have lately
died, we stay silent in our rooms, and do not come out to receive visitors or entertain them.
On the morning of the day on which you arrived, all the men of this house went on the war-path,
so as to obtain some human heads, to enable us to put away our mourning. With us as with you,
it is necessary that one or more human heads be brought into the house before the inmates can
give up sorrowing for their dead relatives and friends. All the people in this house, when
at home, are in the form of human beings, but they are able to transform themselves into birds.
My father, Singalang Burong, is the head of this house. I am the youngest of eight sisters.
We have no brothers alive; our only brother died not long ago, and we are still in mourning
for him, and that is the reason why my sisters did not come out to greet you."

Siu heard with surprise all she had to say. He thought to himself that it was lucky he did
not bring up to the house the birds which he had killed in the jungle, and that he had hidden
them with his blow-pipe and quiver containing poisoned darts in the brushwood near the well.
He determined to say nothing about the matter, as probably some of her friends and relations
were among the birds that were killed by him.

So Siu married Bunsu Burong, and continued to live in the house for several weeks.

One day he said to his wife, "I have been here a long time. My people must surely be wondering
where I am, and whether I am still alive. My mother too must be very anxious about me. I should
like to return to my people, and I want you to accompany me. My mother and my friends are sure
to welcome you as my wife."

"Oh, yes, I will gladly accompany you back to your home. But you must remember and say nothing
of the things you have seen or heard in this house."

They started early the next day, taking with them enough food for four days, as they expected
the journey would last as long as that. Siu's wife seemed to know the way, and after journeying
three days, they came to the stream near the house, and they stopped to have a bath. Slating, really

.
 A Dyak boy
present asked the missionary if he might go back with him to his school. The parents gave their
consent, and the little boy accompanied the missionary on his return to his mission house,
and attended the mission school. There, with other children, the boy was taught the Truths
of the Christian Religion. After being in school for a few years, this boy returned to his
Dyak home.

Years passed. The boy did not forget what he had been taught at school. He saw the Dyaks among
whom he lived, ruled by a fear of evil spirits, and carrying out many superstitious ceremonies,
which he knew must be displeasing to God. As he grew older, he felt sad to think of the ignorance
of his relatives and friends, and of the Dyaks in other villages. So he went back to the missionary
and asked that he should be taught more, so that, later on, he might teach his own people,
and bring some of them into God's Kingdom.

This is a true story of what has happened more than once in Borneo. A boy learns about God
in some up-country mission school, and on his return to his Dyak home, is sorry to see the
ignorance of his people, and asks to be taught more, so that he may become a Catechist and
carry God's Truth to them.

When the seed is sown, it lies in the ground, and God sends the sunshine and the rain to make
it grow. So the Good Seed of the Word of God is sown in the hearts of the Dyaks in Borneo,
and we pray the Great Giver of the Water of Life to refresh it with His Life-giving Holy Spirit.
Some seeds fall on the wayside, and the birds of the air devour them; some fall on a rock,
and are scorched by the heat of the sun; some fall among thorns, and are choked; but, thank
God, some fall on good ground and bring forth good fruit.

The Good Seed of God's Word is being sown among the old and young in Borneo. Will you not take
a share in that good work?
