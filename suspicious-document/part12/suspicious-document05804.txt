On the other side of the fence, an old and long neglected apple orchard, a tumble-down log
barn, and the wreck of a house with the fireplace and chimney standing stark and alone, told
the story. The place was one of those old ranches, purchased by the Power Company for the water
rights, and deserted by those who once had called it home. From the gate, ancient wagon tracks,
overgrown with weeds, led somewhere around the edge of the orchard and were lost in the tangle
of trees and brush on its lower side.

The two men looked at each other in laughing surprise. The burro, turning his head, gazed at
them over his shoulder, inquiringly, as much as to say, "Well, what's the matter now? Why don't
you come along?"

"When in doubt, ask Croesus," said the artist, gravely.

Conrad Lagrange calmly opened the gate.

Promptly, the burro trotted ahead. Following the ancient weed-grown tracks, he led them around
the lower end of the orchard; crossed a little stream; and, turning again, climbed a gentle
rise of open, grassy land behind the orchard; stopping at last, with an air of having accomplished
his purpose, in a beautiful little grove of sycamore trees that bordered a small cienaga.

Completely hidden by the old orchard from the road in front, and backed by the foot of the
mountain spur that here forms the northern wall of the little valley, the spot commanded a
magnificent view of the encircling peaks and ridges. San Bernardino was almost above their
heads. To the east, were the more rugged walls of the upper and narrower end of the canyon;
in their front, the beautiful Oak Knoll, with the dark steeps and pine-fringed crest of the
Galenas against the sky; while to the west, the blue peaks of the far San Gabriels showed above
the lower spurs and foothills of the more immediate range. The foreground was filled in by
the gentle slope leading down to the tiny stream at the edge of the old orchard and, a little
to the left, by the cienaga--rich in the color of its tall marsh grass and reeds, gemmed with
brilliant flowers of gold and scarlet, bordered by graceful willows, and screened from the
eye of the chance traveler by the lattice of tangled orchard boughs.

Seated in the shade of the sycamores on the little knoll, the two friends enjoyed the beauty
of the scene, and the charming seclusion of the lovely retreat; while Croesus stood patiently,
as though waiting to be rewarded for his virtue, by the removal of his pack. Even Czar refrained
from charging here and there, and lay down contentedly at their feet, with an air of having
reached at last the place they had been seeking.

A few days later found them established in a comfortable camp; with tents and furniture and
hammocks and books and the delighted Yee Kee to take care of them. It had been easy to secure
permission from the neighboring rancher who leased the orchard from the Company. Conrad Lagrange,
with the man and his big mountain wagon, had made a trip to town--returning the next day with
Yee Kee and the outfit. He brought, also, things from the studio; for the artist declared that
he would no longer be without the materials of his art.

The first day after the camp was built, the artist--declaring that he would settle the question,
at once, as to whether Yee Kee could cook a trout as skillfully as the novelist--took rod and
flies, and--leaving the famous author in a hammock, with Czar lying near--set out up the canyon.
For perhaps two miles, the painter followed the creek--taking here and there from clear pool
or swirling eddy a fish for his creel, and pausing often, as he went, to enjoy--in artist fashion--the
beauties of the ever changing landscape.

The afternoon was almost gone when he finally turned back toward camp. He had been away, already
longer than he intended; but still--as all fishermen will understand--he could not, on his
way back down the stream, refrain from casting here and there over the pools that tempted him.

The sun was touching the crest of the mountains when he had made but little more than half
the distance of his return. He had just sent his fly skillfully over a deep pool in the shadow
of a granite boulder, for what he determined must be his last cast, when, startlingly clear
and sweet, came the tones of a violin.

A master trout leaped. The hand of the unheeding fisherman felt the tug as the leader broke.
Giving the victorious fish no thought, Aaron King slowly reeled in his line.

There was no mistaking the pure, vibrant tones of the music to which the man listened with
amazed delight. It was the music of the, to him, unknown violinist who lived hidden in the
orange grove next door to his studio home in Fairlands.

Chapter XV

The Forest Ranger's Story

Perhaps the motive that, in Fairlands, had restrained the artist from seeking to know his neighbor
was without force in the mountains. Perhaps it was that, in the unconventional freedom of the
hills, the man obeyed more readily his impulse. Aaron King did not stop to question. As though
in answer to the call of that spirit which spoke in the tones of the violin, he moved in the
direction from which the music came.

Climbing out of the bed of the stream to the bench that slopes hack--a quarter of a mile, perhaps--to
the foot of the canyon wall, he found himself in an old road that, where it once crossed the
creek, had been destroyed by the mountain floods. Wonderingly he followed the dimly marked
track that led through the chaparral toward a thicket of cedars, from beyond which the music
seemed to come. Where the road curved to find its way through the green barrier he paused--the
musician, undoubtedly, now, was just beyond. Still acting upon the impulse of the moment, he
cautiously parted the boughs and peered through into a little, open glade that was closed in
on every side by the rank growth of the mountain vegetation, by the thicket of dark cedars
and by tangled masses of wild rose-bushes. Opposite the spot where he stood, and half concealed
by great sycamore trees, was a small, log house with a thread of blue smoke curling lazily
from the chimney. The place was another of those old ranches that had been purchased by the
Power Company and permitted to go back to the wilderness from which it had been won by some
hardy settler. Cannot. Surely, if put. They yield night, i. I. I enjoy masquerade, or up. I am summons

 Presently, when the girl had moved so that he could not see her, he
turned to his canvas as if, again, absorbed in his work--but hearing still, behind him, the
low-voiced melody of her song.

Then the music ceased; not abruptly, but dying away softly--losing itself, again, in the organ-tones
of the distant waters, as it had come. For a while, the artist worked on; not daring to take
his eyes from his picture; but feeling, in every tingling nerve of him, that she was there.
At last, as if compelled, he abruptly turned his head--and looked straight into her face.

The man had been, apparently, so absorbed in his work, when first the girl caught sight of
him, that she had scarcely been startled. When she had ceased her song, and he, still, had
not looked around; drawn by her interest in the picture, she had softly approached until she
was standing quite close. Her lips were slightly parted, her face was flushed, and her eyes
were shining with delight and excited pleasure, as she stood leaning forward, her basket on
her arm. So interested was she in the painting, that she seemed to have quite forgotten the
painter, and was not in the least embarrassed when he so suddenly looked directly into her face.

"It is beautiful," she said, as though in answer to his question. And no one--hearing her,
and watching her face as she spoke--could have doubted her sincerity. "It is so true, so--so"--she
searched for a word, and smiled in triumph when she found it--"so right--so beautifully right.
It--it makes me feel as--as I feel when I am at church--and the organ plays soft and low, and
the light comes slanting through the window, and some one reads those beautiful words, 'The
Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him'."

"Why!" exclaimed the artist, "that is exactly what I wanted it to say. When I saw this place,
and heard the waters over there, like a great organ; and saw how the sunshine falls through
the trees; I felt as you say, and I am trying to paint the picture so that those who see it
will feel that way too."

Her face was aglow with enthusiastic understanding as she cried eagerly, "Oh, I know! All flagship

Experimentally, he said, "If putting what you feel into your work is greatness, then you are
a great artist, for your music does make one feel as though it came from the mountains, themselves."

She was frankly pleased, and cried intimately, "Oh! do you like my music? I so wanted you to."
