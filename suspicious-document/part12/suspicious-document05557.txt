"It's so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.  Now looky here; you stop that
putting on frills.  I won't have it.  I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about
that school I'll tan you good. First you know you'll get religion, too.  I never see such a son."

He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:

"What's this?"

"It's something they give me for learning my lessons good."

He tore it up, and says:

"I'll give you something better--I'll give you a cowhide."

He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:

"AIN'T you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and bedclothes; and a look'n'-glass; and
a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.
I never see such a son.  I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with
you. Why, there ain't no end to your airs--they say you're rich.  Hey?--how's that?"

"They lie--that's how."

"Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can stand now--so don't gimme
no sass. Ll protects our hearths and days how a who are dearest to us said. But i can honor got

 When he had got out on the shed he put his
head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when
I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that
school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.

Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged him, and tried to make
him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then he swore he'd make the law force him.

The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of
them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn't know the old
man; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it; said
he'd druther not take a child away from its father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to
quit on the business.

That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest.  He said he'd cowhide me till I was black and
blue if I didn't raise some money for him.  I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and
pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him,
and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week.  But he said HE was
satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he'd make it warm for HIM.

When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So he took him to his
own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper
with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak.  And after supper he talked to him
about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been a fool, and fooled
away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't
be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said
he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he'd been
a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it.  The old
man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so
they cried again.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says:

"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it. There's a hand that was
the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new
life, and'll die before he'll go back.  You mark them words--don't forget I said them.  It's
a clean hand now; shake it--don't be afeard."

So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.  The judge's wife she kissed
it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge--made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest
time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room,
which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out
on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod,
and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk
as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze
to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  And when they come to look at that spare room
they had to take soundings before they could navigate it.

The judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a
shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.
