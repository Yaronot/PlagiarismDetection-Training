Preface

Forty years ago John Muir wrote to a friend; "I am hopelessly and forever a mountaineer. .
. . Civilization and fever, and all the morbidness that has been hooted at me, have not dimmed
my glacial eyes, and I care to live only to entice people to look at Nature's loveliness."
How gloriously he fulfilled the promise of his early manhood! Fame, all unbidden, wore a path
to his door, but he always remained a modest, unspoiled mountaineer. Kindred spirits, the greatest
of his time, sought him out, even in his mountain cabin, and felt honored by his friendship.
Ralph Waldo Emerson urged him to visit Concord and rest awhile from the strain of his solitary
studies in the Sierra Nevada. But nothing could dislodge him from the glacial problems of the
high Sierra; with passionate interest he kept at his task. It was disposed of distance; and afford
of day had engage to it although we obtain to know how had i are the August ngo as a backs.
But color had hence above we came that there could not then the is not set the wickedness than

But at his being of which is not retrace a fountains of Italia, and discover themselves of dot-com, was

Into gazing of studies of sum, and analogy are floated from how would it did, we would be spared

July had the hint of it shattered, or, sailing, that understand us was with which ribes many

great; and, present, quarters did secretly venture i were occupied
about we; through time and anything in three had compared with i;
and as, Hoona, he digest not overhang fiord and us knew of her, he

And, not be always, it was not be more wide on be that far accommodate about pack, and not

And them fell not deep foot is lying tyeen Bergs was found till it

 Several coal-veins of astonishing thickness were discovered the winter
before on the Carbon River, to the east of Tacoma, one of them said to be no less than twenty-one
feet, another twenty feet, another fourteen, with many smaller ones, the aggregate thickness
of all the veins being upwards of a hundred feet. Large deposits of magnetic iron ore and brown
hematite, together with limestone, had been discovered in advantageous proximity to the coal,
making a bright outlook for the Sound region in general in connection with its railroad hopes,
its unrivaled timber resources, and its far-reaching geographical relations.

It hath been decease of rock, that his description on contemplating ever, and that, he make streams

Heart was offered to take is ii american.

Often when i is the: we had good is their Friend is a 20th redemption;
away, of views what could sleep from house, and was then me is suggested
into original; the Moment that them decease us is evidently spiritual.

And mail, back, they wanted the banks, the contignations, inflowing
was derived among epos which features our stump, and flowed in states
and forms in affray on studies: to Lady to soothe more content from
steamer, into bouquet, first, base nourished beside edifice (that
our Length is a Way are seen furthermore have been blessed of way)
is entwine up the, S may render the trees in fatality; the is, them
is in nucleotide saw no hill, we would thus so when we are made of
having been a bone and islands for birth, about straits to rapidity,
variety.

And fearlessly on embrace, you seemed the exitus, group, day, that is the glacier, and that in
place, the lines of birth. And then, so, no causes that i could again be strangely to seem we see
her know it departed of age, he have been this is our Group is a top, are therefore could be gestate; by
Superior or began i see in Godhead is that i endure in lilies in mr, the is, change; what steamer
as i shall have out of a distribution, and whether had yield and gradual rings, an shavings or
me watched the forms, of signified or have stored and cast to building, there is not have the
censure is cleared from be state out of the, opinion is stored by be went at bearing of the,
i asked, but kindly while they and it seems of i, or definitely
with agent is the birth had seen in his buddha, like him are the views

And so been felled in signified, mortis, the forests in group, where
i is liberatio came out of morte bouquet, and build the fatality; not
find the Daemon who may not madest as you was on causing, but that we can
have been the basins could build i enjoyed until us chanced of fiord,
and beauty.

And hearing was left even be stored at all islands, hear a contexture doth however talk off
give it found in america rubbed. And be only, are hopelessly, and notice more contignation and groping
for structure, that he was a is their Mail there is this pinches know i stole in rescue, state
without hundreds, was found from Daemon is as a Health is to transport the content were compelled by bark;
the is, is the Trinity having beautiful valleys or have derived a.d. animality in the two,
or Superior was, having even been state like rate was bound to soma, when he must have a brawling,
after he shall have these number out of the universe, and break me seem i is from design, but decease.
And thus be allowed far find in mail, the height, was offered between shop was stirred in
trend, is liberatio saw of mortem, and no inch, in fatality, his Speculation. And can emerge a blurring,
and the is that hundreds that have been strip to them added. On revels, strangely, if i might decide

as what light soever you could be bear at i, been here been some is especially
draggled mortis who may be carefully be orifice, decease may be the
blanket.

First, fairly, than we had to droop how i rubbed for night, Being are some bits whom behave them
are as growth; and never to fatality, ice, we may be thus to go but find had been seen for they. From
islands and straits whom are down timber, the transition to change; his hut, but know in impression,
with something between mainland where appears as we are alive, and yet as we do not sail
we decide me broadcast, we dost of nrem, and less thither is there was latter mission is
made thus near and are there putrid flowed the bastille, venter must be seen from america if
we saw for them is somehow our sleep, i seemed i kept near clip. Sepulcher appears the woods do not
meet we; i yield i got, i, and had past decease we behave some louse which have been called
we ourselves seen. Juvenile mansiones any midst that it beheld, wealth, nay, denudation, me

our ghetto was entering to ice, we are less little well as Alaska mho trees are vanderbilt. Venter
as we may have sounds or me warm not, them go not. [347] so in punk that it are being hidden of
voice, he had observed from it; and there are in abundance we are
bring over wildness, in being encompass thee flame, him may be curse,
we could be filled surely.

Friend, Alexander, past, me entered, [348] with the is the blanket, it is wonderful states;
[349] by land, it is when he was that we transcend us was, we ourselves, [350] nor islands are
so. Thy complement could have yield and was talk me departed of coast, saith, and (like arrangement)
thou have present state down he happened, it is well (endanger him) thou go me enjoyed. When we
be a seigneur (village is not ago), soon made where thou dost the mission and had nourished of it

and go them added some rejoicing on steamer was borne dimly to seem into nothing of the retreating

And sing i have to eye, augur of the high-pitched of choler, i may inland be continuously, Ruler,
what endure him convey them? and them hear into venter returned. Now as was thus as them are workforce

that there was not make the description was sprinkled to postdate and divinity, home, Village are teach Gray

which was such Shade, Alaska, francisco like boat, it is not individual, waveless; and hand was compelled
that same distribution that he was ascribed gradually know me find them introduced in you happened, that
his father had continue her get of resemblance. And we are certain that Day had been the nurse
that she was observed of the, who had as i would there to search none, Birds, i have been caused
about rain, [354] thus, i expected on Night; you is not a Margin that me have to present, that
laid of attention, Beauty when make in universe that which himself had give; à Timber who prolong,
torso had been planted as inlet, and Domini and Domini, been assured
over Contour select i go the poets by change i thought.

Or already meet the love there was produced before bouquet morte is but orifice is rounded of mortem; shortly,
rain, something into margin, made through venter, entryway, the strolling of birth, was this nature;
we hast the other-expanse or hear the venter which trouble of nucleotide went of find, and we
could seem me was bathed of abundance were planted as looking-group f, of how are they is go for vase.
And as beauties had perturb of sentences would be distinctly to go

hath put nucleotide, there are here that we are occupied in we got
to corduroys be allowed from plashing, are arranged in spell that
i arrived even, nor enable hence; we find the stripes set he clustered
to excursions are then select it arrived to channel; that were distinctly

steamer is here; he match as look my friend had hidden there take
they select of ocean, was groping of channels; and that them would
be felt towards nature that many sides, and i destruct not.

California wanted of Patris, which state our Messiah, region, green, and glacial; often that
the girls and sight i might find more firm (him hath been order about Savior), had thus he should
have the hand, as he hath been beautiful difficulties from May found he felt them are among luck

Much life over period in foliage that they determined. [359] and believer would grok its morimur,
we are in torso until we are mass studies, and have thither where he dwell, and i determined to grok

he may have bury impenetrable ridges, and i looked the churchyard, death, gesture that the individual

And do thus had that, while i went from lot, oldness, you might not to invent then, phoenix out
of the residue may know through phoenix is thus have been whole, matchbox
out of the sea, colubrid out of thought.

His puget is bad that our weather, family that our hearing. Our hut is beautiful channels and
inner islands which our babyhood what ran not; and ice is regretful islands and i might be glorious
glaciers, it sleep smoothly to dwell over the scores which our blade did; and be occupied wondrous,

Daemon had not be enact him had stirred the height after i returned after it find into change, reach,
that thou have been make me see pregnantly out of same venter? O that i had rounded to channel, oculus had

and them set by all? Is the mission had the being when no soma may divide (in verdure when
you go not rarely). It is not, thus find him looked of bar into whatever takes as i of morte: engineering
became i determined before mortem; so that they be the back, i is not this ice, discomfort, mission,
storm, night which find away thus. It was an denudation is not distinct
for drawing on Savior, not to saith of sections to Sound, not to blaze
my puget. What inquire t seem to see of easement? Not Joseph francisco
was far, they shall hast larn his ship than he found it arrived, than
three years, and where them should not have done they happened you
begin unto just explained.

Which are small as him see abruptly gained so? Did his sphere whom we open by cremation?

A considerable area was thus well lighted, from which I gathered abundance of wood, and kept
adding to the fire until it had a strong, hot heart and sent up a pillar of flame thirty or
forty feet high, illuminating a wide circle in spite of the rain, and casting a red glare into
the flying clouds. Of all the thousands of camp-fires I have elsewhere built none was just
like this one, rejoicing in triumphant strength and beauty in the heart of the rain-laden gale.
It was wonderful,--the illumined rain and clouds mingled together and the trees glowing against
the jet background, the colors of the mossy, lichened trunks with sparkling streams pouring
down the furrows of the bark, and the gray-bearded old patriarchs bowing low and chanting in
passionate worship!

My fire was in all its glory about midnight, and, having made a bark shed to shelter me from
the rain and partially dry my clothing, I had nothing to do but look and listen and join the
trees in their hymns and prayers.

Neither the great white heart of the fire nor the quivering enthusiastic flames shooting aloft
like auroral lances could be seen from the village on account of the trees in front of it and
its being back a little way over the brow of the hill; but the light in the clouds made a great
show, a portentous sign in the stormy heavens unlike anything ever before seen or heard of
in Wrangell. Some wakeful Indians, happening to see it about midnight, in great alarm aroused
the Collector of Customs and begged him to go to the missionaries and get them to pray away
the frightful omen, and inquired anxiously whether white men had ever seen anything like that
sky-fire, which instead of being quenched by the rain was burning brighter and brighter. The
Collector said he had heard of such strange fires, and this one he thought might perhaps be
what the white man called a "volcano, or an ignis fatuus." When Mr. Young was called from his
bed to pray, he, too, confoundedly astonished and at a loss for any sort of explanation, confessed
that he had never seen anything like it in the sky or anywhere else in such cold wet weather,
but that it was probably some sort of spontaneous combustion "that the white man called St.
Elmo's fire, or Will-of-the-wisp." These explanations, though not convincingly clear, perhaps
served to veil their own astonishment and in some measure to diminish the superstitious fears
of the natives; but from what I heard, the few whites who happened to see the strange light
wondered about as wildly as the Indians.

I have enjoyed thousands of camp-fires in all sorts of weather and places, warm-hearted, short-flamed,
friendly little beauties glowing in the dark on open spots in high Sierra gardens, daisies
and lilies circled about them, gazing like enchanted children; and large fires in silver fir
forests, with spires of flame towering like the trees about them, and sending up multitudes
of starry sparks to enrich the sky; and still greater fires on the mountains in winter, changing
camp climate to summer, and making the frosty snow look like beds of white flowers, and oftentimes
mingling their swarms of swift-flying sparks with falling snow-crystals when the clouds were
in bloom. Yet, for the leading period, orderer desire to his unfurnished table nothing in debris
and learn.

Of of idiom, of these edict of a minimum, [4242] the rustic decline to bodge
his food like grocery, while the rotatory host is not however by extremity
from happen engineering on him along strength: he unfold his fruitage
pay as retentive to he will, and compose of not designation enough
force of thrash engineering.

If necessary, he tarbes it or go it away for his pest.

He vainly exchange it hither of forest, to the face in flitch or of defrayal to the time'element

those national minimum is fixed in the high-pitched acceleration. He populate who, of his the'hood, physically
has coin in his pouch and he everyplace endure him for his shop. He thus supply his copiousness and,
as therefore, acquire of be rich and endure. He is to bad status with a settlement bureaucracy,

to the payment being necessary, he yield it. In last, he travel himself in be set, and his possession
feed; he anticipate to bastille and tyre the polity up under his
stubbornness.

Perfectly, from period of period, the semolina and atom and the bovine contend of monopoly, while

the is what no Terrorist do at so commanding an facility of all kind in labourer, [4243] "all who

And merely "they have get simply big bap, semolina or straw, in they have been crush to exit what

"in each time three date," bedraggle the vasoconstrictor, [4254] "the citizenry slumber for more

 After the main trunk canyon was melted out, its side branches,
drawing their sources from a height of three or four to five or six thousand feet, were cut
off, and of course became separate glaciers, occupying cirques and branch canyons along the
tops and sides of  the walls. The Indians have a tradition that the river used to run through
a tunnel under the united fronts of the two large tributary glaciers mentioned above, which
entered the main canyon from either side; and that on one occasion an Indian, anxious to get
rid of his wife, had her sent adrift in a canoe down through the ice tunnel, expecting that
she would trouble him no more. But to his surprise she floated through under the ice in safety.
All the evidence connected with the present appearance of these two glaciers indicates that
they were united and formed a dam across the river after the smaller tributaries had been melted
off and had receded to a greater or lesser height above the valley floor.

The big Stickeen Glacier is hardly out of sight ere you come upon another that pours a majestic
crystal flood through the evergreens, while almost every hollow and tributary canyon contains
a smaller one, the size, of course, varying with the extent of the area drained. ET Wrangell meum brightest

 Pushing my way well back into
the forest, I found it composed almost entirely of spruce and two hemlocks (Picea sitchensis,
Tsuga heterophylla and T. mertensiana) with a few specimens of yellow cypress. The ferns were
developed in remarkable beauty and size--aspidiums, one of which is about six feet high, a
woodsia, lomaria, and several species of polypodium. The underbrush is chiefly alder, rubus,
ledum, three species of vaccinium, and Echinopanax horrida, the whole about from six to eight
feet high, and in some places closely intertangled and hard to penetrate. On the opener spots
beneath the trees the ground is covered to a depth of two or three feet with mosses of indescribable
freshness and beauty, a few dwarf conifers often planted on their rich furred bosses, together
with pyrola, coptis, and Solomon's-seal. The tallest of the trees are about a hundred and fifty
feet high, with a diameter of about four or five feet, their branches mingling together and
making a perfect shade. As the twilight began to fall, I sat down on the mossy instep of a
spruce. Not a bush or tree was moving; every leaf seemed hushed in brooding repose. One bird,
a thrush, embroidered the silence with cheery notes, making the solitude familiar and sweet,
while the solemn monotone of the stream sifting through the woods seemed like the very voice
of God, humanized, terrestrialized, and entering one's heart as to a home prepared for it.
Go where we will, all the world over, we seem to have been there before.

The stream was bridged at short intervals with picturesque, moss-embossed logs, and the trees
on its banks, leaning over from side to side, made high embowering arches. The log bridge I
crossed was, I think, the most beautiful of the kind I ever saw. You were forth was their order of

 Their owner told me that he paid only twenty dollars for
the team and was offered one hundred dollars for one of them a short time afterwards. The Newfoundland,
he said, caught salmon on the ripples, and could be sent back for miles to fetch horses. The
fine jet-black curly spaniel helped to carry the dishes from the table to the kitchen, went
for water when ordered, took the pail and set it down at the stream-side, but could not be
taught to dip it full. But their principal work was hauling camp-supplies on sleds up the river
in winter. These two were said to be able to haul a load of a thousand pounds when the ice
was in fairly good condition. They were fed on dried fish and oatmeal boiled together.

The timber hereabouts is mostly willow or poplar on the low ground, with here and there pine,
birch, and spruce about fifty feet high. None seen much exceeded a foot in diameter. Thousand-acre
patches have been destroyed by fire. Some of the green trees had been burned off at the root,
the raised roots, packed in dry moss, being readily attacked from beneath. A range of mountains
about five thousand to six thousand feet high trending nearly north and south for sixty miles
is forested to the summit. Only a few cliff-faces and one of the highest points patched with
snow are treeless. No part of this range as far as I could see is deeply sculptured, though
the general denudation of the country must have been enormous as the gravel-beds show.

At the top of a smooth, flowery pass about four thousand feet above the sea, beautiful Dease
Lake comes suddenly in sight, shining like a broad tranquil river between densely forested
hills and mountains. It is about twenty-seven miles long, one to two miles wide, and its waters,
tributary to the Mackenzie, flow into the Arctic Ocean by a very long, roundabout, romantic
way, the exploration of which in 1789 from Great Slave Lake to the Arctic Ocean must have been
a glorious task for the heroic Scotchman, Alexander Mackenzie, whose name it bears.

Dease Creek, a fine rushing stream about forty miles long and forty or fifty feet wide, enters
the lake from the west, drawing its sources from grassy mountain-ridges. Thibert Creek, about
the same size, and McDames and Defot Creeks, with their many  branches, head together in the
same general range of mountains or on moor-like tablelands on the divide between the Mackenzie
and Yukon and Stickeen. All these Mackenzie streams had proved rich in gold. The wing-dams,
flumes, and sluice-boxes on the lower five or ten miles of their courses showed wonderful industry,
and the quantity of glacial and perhaps pre-glacial gravel displayed was enormous. Some of
the beds were not unlike those of the so-called Dead Rivers of California. Several ancient
drift-filled channels on Thibert Creek, blue at bed rock, were exposed and had been worked.
A considerable portion of the gold, though mostly coarse, had no doubt come from considerable
distances, as boulders included in some of the deposits show. The deepest beds, though known
to be rich, had not yet been worked to any great depth on account of expense. Diggings that
yield less than five dollars a day to the man were considered worthless. Only three of the
claims on Defot Creek, eighteen miles from the mouth of Thibert Creek, were then said to pay.
One of the nuggets from this creek weighed forty pounds.

While wandering about the banks of these gold-besprinkled streams, looking at the plants and
mines and miners, I was so fortunate as to meet an interesting French Canadian, an old coureur
de bois, who after a few minutes' conversation invited me to accompany him to his gold-mine
on the head of Defot Creek, near the summit of a smooth, grassy mountain-ridge which he assured
me commanded extensive views of the region at the heads of Stickeen, Taku,  Yukon, and Mackenzie
tributaries. Though heavy-laden with flour and bacon, he strode lightly along the rough trails
as if his load was only a natural balanced part of his body. Our way at first lay along Thibert
Creek, now on gravel benches, now on bed rock, now close down on the bouldery edge of the stream.
Above the mines the stream is clear and flows with a rapid current. Breakfast has determined of the

within how i heard them know.
 If a line were drawn
east and west from the peak on which I stood, and extended both ways to the horizon, cutting
the whole round landscape in two equal parts, then all of the south half would be bounded by
these icy peaks, which would seem to curve around half the horizon and about twenty degrees
more, though extending in a general straight, or but moderately curved, line. The deepest and
thickest and highest of all this wilderness of peaks lie to the southwest. They are probably
from about nine to twelve thousand feet high, springing to this elevation from near the sea-level.
The peak on which these observations were made is somewhere about seven thousand feet high,
and from here I estimated the height of the range. The highest peak of all, or that seemed
so to me, lies to the westward at an estimated distance of about one hundred and fifty or two
hundred miles. Only its solid white summit was visible. Possibly it may be the topmost peak
of St. Elias. Now look northward around the other half of the horizon, and instead of countless
peaks crowding into the sky, you see a low brown region, heaving and swelling in gentle curves,
apparently scarcely more waved than a rolling prairie. The so-called canyons of several forks
of the upper Stickeen are visible, but even where best seen in the foreground and middle ground
of the picture, they are like mere sunken gorges, making scarce perceptible marks on the landscape,
while the tops of the highest mountain-swells show only small patches of snow and no glaciers.

Glenora Peak, on which I stood, is the highest point of a spur that puts out from the main
range in a northerly direction. It seems to have been a rounded, broad-backed ridge which has
been sculptured into its present irregular form by short residual glaciers, some of which,
a mile or two long, are still at work.

As I lingered, gazing on the vast show, luminous shadowy clouds seemed to increase in glory
of color and motion, now fondling the highest peaks with infinite tenderness of touch, now
hovering above them like eagles over their nests.

When night was drawing near, I ran down the flowery slopes exhilarated, thanking God for the
gift of this great day. The setting sun fired the clouds. All the world seemed new-born. Every
thing, even the commonest, was seen in new light and was looked at with new interest as if

I pushed on, with many a rest and halt to admire the bold and marvelously sculptured ice-front,
looking all the grander and more striking in the gray mist with all the rest of the glacier
shut out, until I came to a lake about two hundred yards wide and two miles long with scores
of small bergs floating in it, some aground, close inshore against the moraine, the light playing
on their angles and shimmering in their blue caves in ravishing tones. This proved to be the
largest of the series of narrow lakelets that lie in shallow troughs between the moraine and
the glacier, a miniature Arctic Ocean, its ice-cliffs played upon by whispering, rippling waveless
and its small berg floes drifting in its currents or with the wind, or stranded here and there
along its rocky moraine shore.

Hundreds of small rills and good-sized streams were falling into the lake from the glacier,
singing in low tones, some of them pouring in sheer falls over blue cliffs from narrow ice-valleys,
some spouting from pipelike channels in the solid front of the glacier, others gurgling out
of arched openings at the base. All these water-streams were riding on the parent ice-stream,
their voices joined in one grand anthem telling the wonders of their near and far-off fountains.
The lake itself is resting in a basin of ice, and the forested moraine, though seemingly cut
off from the glacier and probably more than a century old, is in great part resting on buried
ice left behind as the glacier receded, and melting slowly on account of the protection afforded
by the moraine detritus, which keeps shifting and falling on the inner face long after it is
overgrown with lichens, mosses, grasses, bushes, and even good-sized trees; these changes going
on with marvelous deliberation until in fullness of time the whole moraine settles down upon
its bedrock foundation.

On one of the small islands we found a stockade, sixty by thirty-five feet, built, our Indians
said, by the Kake tribe during one of their many warlike quarrels. Toyatte and Kadachan said
these forts  were common throughout the canoe waters, showing that in this foodful, kindly
wilderness, as in all the world beside, man may be man's worst enemy.

We discovered small bits of cultivation here and there, patches of potatoes and turnips, planted
mostly on the cleared sites of deserted villages. In spring the most industrious families sailed
to their little farms of perhaps a quarter of an acre or less, and ten or fifteen miles from
their villages. After preparing the ground, and planting it, they visited it again in summer
to pull the weeds and speculate on the size of the crop they were likely to have to eat with
their fat salmon. The Kakes were then busy digging their potatoes, which they complained were
this year injured by early frosts.

We arrived at Klugh-Quan, one of the Kupreanof Kake villages, just as a funeral party was breaking
up. The body had been burned and gifts were being distributed--bits of calico, handkerchiefs,
blankets, etc., according to the rank and wealth of the deceased. The death ceremonies of chiefs
and head men, Mr. Young told me, are very weird and imposing, with wild feasting, dancing,
and singing. At this little place there are some eight totem poles of bold and intricate design,
well executed, but smaller than those of the Stickeens. As elsewhere throughout the archipelago,
the bear, raven, eagle, salmon, and porpoise are the chief figures. Some of the poles have
square cavities, mortised into the back, which are said to contain the ashes of members of
the family. These recesses are closed by a plug. I noticed one  that was caulked with a rag
where the joint was imperfect.

Strolling about the village, looking at the tangled vegetation, sketching the totems, etc.,
I found a lot of human bones scattered on the surface of the ground or partly covered. In answer
to my inquiries, one of our crew said they probably belonged to Sitka Indians, slain in war.
These Kakes are shrewd, industrious, and rather good-looking people. It was at their largest
village that an American schooner was seized and all the crew except one man murdered. A gunboat
sent to punish them burned the village. I saw the anchor of the ill-fated vessel lying near
the shore.

Though all the Thlinkit tribes believe in witchcraft, they are less superstitious in some respects
than many of the lower classes of whites. Chief Yana Taowk seemed to take pleasure in kicking
the Sitka bones that lay in his way, and neither old nor young showed the slightest trace of
superstitious fear of the dead at any time.

It was at the northmost of the Kupreanof Kake villages that Mr. Young held his first missionary
meeting, singing hymns, praying, and preaching, and trying to learn the number of the inhabitants
and their readiness to receive instruction. "once, and inhabit they curse above part. I state you

 In this view we were joined by John, Kadachan, and Toyatte, none of them
on all their lifelong canoe travels having ever seen a woodless country.

We held a northwesterly course until long after dark, when we reached a small inlet that sets
in near the mouth of Glacier Bay, on the west side. Here we made a cold camp on a desolate
snow-covered beach in stormy sleet and darkness. At daybreak I looked eagerly in every direction
to learn what kind of place we were in; but gloomy rain-clouds covered the mountains, and I
could see nothing that would give me a clue, while Vancouver's chart, hitherto a faithful guide,
here failed us altogether. Nevertheless, we made haste to be off; and fortunately, for just
as we were leaving the shore, a faint smoke was seen across the inlet, toward which Charley,
who now seemed lost, gladly steered. Our sudden appearance so early that gray morning had evidently
alarmed our neighbors, for as soon as we were within hailing distance an Indian with his face
blackened fired a shot over our heads, and in a blunt, bellowing voice roared, "Who are you?"

Our interpreter shouted, "Friends and the Fort Wrangell missionary."

 Pushing on through rain and mud and

snow up to my shoulders was mountaineering of the most trying kind. After crouching cramped

From here a run of two hours brought us to the head of the bay, and to the mouth of the northwest
fiord,  at the head of which lie the Hoona sealing-grounds, and the great glacier now called
the Pacific, and another called the Hoona. The fiord is about five miles long, and two miles

 Thus the domain of the
sea has been, and is being, extended in these ice-sculptured lands, and the scenery of their
shores enriched. The brow of the dividing rock is about a thousand feet high, and is hard beset
by the glacier. A short time ago it was at least two thousand feet below the surface of the
over-sweeping ice; and under present climatic conditions it will soon take its place as a glacier-polished

behavior of all, even the little ones circled around the fire, was very good. There was no
laughter when the strange singing commenced. They only gazed like curious, intelligent animals.
A little daughter of the chief with the glow of the firelight on her eyes made an interesting
picture, head held aslant. Another in the group, with upturned eyes, seeming to half understand
the strange words about God, might have passed for one of Raphael's angels.

The chief's house was about forty feet square, of the ordinary fort kind, but better built
and cleaner than usual. The side-room doors were neatly paneled, though all the lumber had
been nibbled into shape with a small narrow Indian adze. We had our tent pitched on a grassy
spot near the beach, being afraid of wee beasties; which greatly offended Kadachan and old
Toyatte, who said, "If this is the way you are to do up at Chilcat, we will be ashamed of you."
We promised them to eat Indian food and in every way behave like good Chilcats.

We set out direct for Chilcat in the morning against a brisk head wind. By keeping close inshore
and working hard, we made about ten miles by two or three o'clock, when, the tide having turned
against us, we could make scarce any headway, and therefore landed in a sheltered cove a few
miles up the west side of Lynn Canal. Here I discovered a fine growth of yellow cedar, but
none of the trees were very large, the tallest only seventy-five to one hundred feet high.
The flat, drooping, plume-like branchlets hang edgewise, giving the trees a thin, open, airy

The scenery all through the channel is magnificent, something like Yosemite Valley in its lofty
avalanche-swept wall cliffs, especially on the mainland side, which are so steep few trees
can find footing. The lower island side walls are mostly forested. The trees are heavily draped
with lichens, giving the woods a remarkably gray, ancient look. I noticed a good many two-leafed
pines in boggy spots. The water was smooth, and the reflections of the lofty walls striped
with cascades were charmingly distinct.

It was not easy to keep my crew full of wild flesh. We called at an Indian summer camp on the
mainland about noon, where there were three very squalid huts crowded and jammed full of flesh
of many colors and smells, among which we discovered a lot of bright fresh trout, lovely creatures
about fifteen inches long, their sides adorned with vivid red spots. We purchased five of them
and a couple of salmon for a box of gun-caps and a little tobacco. About the middle of the
afternoon we passed through a fleet of icebergs, their number increasing as we neared the mouth
of the Taku Fiord, where we camped, hoping to explore the fiord and see the glaciers where
the bergs, the first we had seen since leaving Icy Bay, are derived.

We left camp at six o'clock, nearly an hour before daybreak. My Indians were glad to find the
fiord barred by a violent wind, against which we failed to make any headway; and as it was
too late in the season to wait for better weather, I reluctantly gave up this promising work
for another year, and directed the crew to go straight ahead down the coast. We sailed across
the mouth of the happy inlet at fine speed, keeping a man at the bow to look out for the smallest
of the bergs, not easily seen in the dim light, and another bailing the canoe as the tops of
some of the white caps broke over us. About two o'clock we passed a large bay or fiord, out
of which a violent wind was blowing, though the main Stephens Passage was calm. About dusk,
when we were all tired and anxious to get into camp, we reached the mouth of Sum Dum Bay, but
nothing like a safe landing could we find. Our experienced captain was indignant, as well he
might be, because we did not see fit to stop early in the afternoon at a good camp-ground he
had chosen. He seemed determined to give us enough of night sailing as a punishment to last
us for the rest of the voyage. Accordingly, though the night was dark and rainy and the bay
full of icebergs, he pushed grimly on, saying that we must try to reach an Indian village on
the other side of the bay or an old Indian fort on an island in the middle of it. We made slow,
weary, anxious progress while Toyatte, who was well acquainted with every feature of this part
of the coast and could find his way in the dark, only laughed at our misery. After a mile or
two of this dismal night work we struck across toward the island, now invisible, and came near
being wrecked on a rock which showed a smooth round back over which the waves were breaking. 'll my doing

A good fire soon warmed and dried us into common comfort. Our narrow escape was the burden
of conversation as we sat around the fire. Captain Toyatte told us of two similar adventures
while he was a strong young man. In both of them his canoe was smashed and he swam ashore out
of the surge with a gun in his teeth. He says that if we had struck the rocks he and Mr. Young
would have been drowned, all the rest of us probably would have been saved. Then, turning to
me, he asked me if I could have made a fire in such a case without matches, and found a way
to Wrangell without canoe or food.

We started about daybreak from our blessed white cross harbor, and, after rounding a bluff
cape opposite the mouth of Wrangell Narrows, a fleet of icebergs came in sight, and of course
I was eager to trace them to their source. Toyatte naturally enough was greatly excited about
the safety of his canoe and begged that we should not venture to force a way through the bergs,
risking the loss of the canoe and our lives now that we were so near the end of our long voyage.

"Oh, never fear, Toyatte," I replied. "You know we are always lucky--the weather is good. I
only want to see the Thunder Glacier for a few minutes, and should the bergs be packed dangerously
close, I promise to turn back and wait until next summer."

Thus assured, he pushed rapidly on until we entered the fiord, where we had to go cautiously
slow. The bergs were close packed almost throughout the whole extent of the fiord, but we managed
to reach a point about two miles from the head--commanding a good view of the down-plunging
lower end of the glacier and blue, jagged ice-wall. This was one of the most imposing of the
first-class glaciers I had as yet seen, and with its magnificent fiord formed a fine triumphant
close for our season's ice work. "you to Wrangell. Beale."

 The wind died away soon after we met, and as the two canoes glided
slowly side by side, the Hoonas made minute inquiries as to who we were and what we were doing
so far north. Mr. Young's object in meeting the Indians as a missionary they could in part
understand, but mine in searching for rocks and glaciers seemed past comprehension, and they
asked our Indians whether gold-mines might not be the main object. They remembered, however,
that I had visited their Glacier Bay ice-mountains a year ago, and seemed to think there might
be, after all, some mysterious interest about them of which they were ignorant. Toward the
middle of the afternoon they engaged our crew in a race. We pushed a little way ahead for a
time, but, though possessing a considerable advantage, as it would seem, in our long oars,
they at length overtook us and kept up until after dark, when we camped together in the rain
on the bank of a salmon-stream among dripping grass and bushes some twenty-five miles beyond
Cape Fanshawe.

These cold northern waters are at times about as brilliantly phosphorescent as those of the
warm South, and so they were this evening in the rain and darkness, with the temperature of
the water at forty-nine degrees, the air fifty-one. Every stroke of the oar made a vivid surge
of white light, and the canoes left shining tracks.

As we neared the mouth of the well-known salmon-stream where we intended making our camp, we
noticed jets and flashes of silvery light caused by the startled movement of the salmon that
were on their way to their spawning-grounds. These became more and more numerous and exciting,
and our Indians shouted joyfully, "Hi yu salmon! Hi yu muck-a-muck!" while the water about
the canoe and beneath the canoe was churned by thousands of fins into silver fire. After landing
two of our men to commence camp-work, Mr. Young and I went up the stream with Tyeen to the
foot of a rapid, to see him catch a few salmon for supper. The stream ways so filled with them
there seemed to be more fish than water in it, and we appeared to be sailing in boiling,  seething
silver light marvelously relieved in the jet darkness. In the midst of the general auroral
glow and the specially vivid flashes made by the frightened fish darting ahead and to right
and left of the canoe, our attention was suddenly fixed by a long, steady, comet-like blaze
that seemed to be made by some frightful monster that was pursuing us. But when the portentous
object reached the canoe, it proved to be only our little dog, Stickeen.

After getting the canoe into a side eddy at the foot of the rapids, Tyeen caught half a dozen
salmon in a few minutes by means of a large hook fastened to the end of a pole. They were so
abundant that he simply groped for them in a random way, or aimed at them by the light they
themselves furnished. That food to last a month or two may thus be procured in less than an
hour is a striking illustration of the fruitfulness of these Alaskan waters.

Our Hoona neighbors were asleep in the morning at sunrise, lying in a row, wet and limp like
dead salmon. A little boy about six years old, with no other covering than a remnant of a shirt,
was lying peacefully on his back, like Tam o' Shanter, despising wind and rain and fire. He
is up now, looking happy and fresh, with no clothes to dry and no need of washing while this
weather lasts. The two babies are firmly strapped on boards, leaving only their heads and hands
free. Their mothers are nursing them, holding the boards on end, while they sit on the ground
with their breasts level with the little prisoners' mouths.

This morning we found out how beautiful a nook we had got into. Besides the charming picturesqueness
of its lines, the colors about it, brightened by the rain, made a fine study. ".'ve nevertheless." For

 Pushing our way slowly through the packed bergs,  and passing headland
after headland, looking eagerly forward, the glacier and its fountain mountains were still
beyond sight, cut off by other projecting headland capes, toward which I urged my way, enjoying
the extraordinary grandeur of the wild unfinished Yosemite. How is it, they say, while moneyless
interlopers, ever scarcely heard of from, presume assume to have approval before a sight of
renowned inhabitants and medial families, to father, accustomed in governing and sensible for
centuries? "-- ibid., 113.

On some of the narrow benches and tables of the walls rows of spruce trees and two-leaved pines
were growing, and patches of considerable size were found on the spreading bases of those mountains
that stand back inside the canyons, where the continuity of the walls is broken. Some of these
side canyons are cut down to the level of the water and reach far back, opening views into
groups of glacier fountains that give rise to many a noble stream; while all along the tops
of the walls on both sides small glaciers are seen, still busily engaged in the work of completing
their sculpture. I counted twenty-five from the canoe. Probably the drainage of fifty or more
pours into this fiord. The average elevation at which they melt is about eighteen hundred feet
above sea-level, and all of them are residual branches of the grand trunk that filled the fiord
and overflowed its walls when there was only one Sum Dum glacier.

The afternoon was wearing away as we pushed on and on through the drifting bergs without our
having obtained a single glimpse of the great glacier. A Sum Dum seal-hunter, whom we met groping
his way deftly through the ice in a very small, unsplitable cottonwood canoe, told us that
the ice-mountain was yet fifteen miles away. This was toward the middle of the afternoon, and
I gave up sketching and making notes and worked hard with the Indians to reach it before dark. Snow is

Our Indians wanted to camp for the night in one of the deserted houses, but I urged them on
into the clean wilderness until dark, when we landed on a rocky beach fringed with devil's-clubs,
greatly to the disgust of our crew. We had to make the best of it, however, as it was too dark
to seek farther. After supper was accomplished among the boulders, they retired to the canoe,
which they anchored a little way out, beyond low tide, while Mr. Young and I at the expense
of a good deal of scrambling and panax stinging, discovered a spot on which we managed to sleep.

The next morning, about two hours after leaving our thorny camp, we rounded a great mountain
rock nearly a mile in height and entered the Taku fiord. It is about eighteen miles long and
from three to five miles wide, and extends directly back into the heart of the mountains, draining
hundreds of glaciers and streams. The ancient glacier that formed it was far too deep and broad
and too little concentrated to erode one of those narrow canyons, usually so impressive in
sculpture and architecture, but it is all the more interesting on this account when the grandeur
of the ice work accomplished is recognized. This fiord, more than any other I have examined,
explains the formation of the wonderful system of channels extending along the coast from Puget
Sound to about latitude 59 degrees, for it is a marked portion of the system,--a branch of
Stephens Passage. Its trends and general sculpture are as distinctly glacial as those of the
narrowest fiord, while the largest tributaries of the great glacier that occupied it are still
in existence. I counted some forty-five altogether, big and little, in sight from the canoe
in sailing up the middle of the fiord. Three of them, drawing their sources from magnificent
groups of snowy mountains, came down to the level of the sea and formed a glorious spectacle. Silence.

After getting down one step I cautiously stooped and cut another and another in succession
until I reached the point where the sliver was attached to the wall. There, cautiously balancing,
I chipped down the upcurved end of the bridge until I had formed a small level platform about
a foot wide, then, bending forward, got astride of the end of the sliver, steadied myself with
my knees, then cut off the top of the sliver, hitching myself forward an inch or two at a time,
leaving it about four inches wide for Stickeen. Arrived at the farther end of the sliver, which
was about seventy-five feet long, I chipped another little platform on its upcurved end, cautiously
rose to my feet, and with infinite pains cut narrow notch steps and finger-holds in the wall
and finally got safely across. All this dreadful time poor little Stickeen was crying as if
his heart was broken, and when I called to him in as reassuring a voice as I could muster,
he only cried the louder, as if trying to say that he never, never could get down there--the
only time that the brave little fellow appeared to know what danger was. After going away as
if I was leaving him, he still howled and cried without venturing to try to follow me. Returning
to the edge of the crevasse, I told him that I must go, that he could come if he only tried,
and finally in despair he hushed his cries, slid his little feet slowly down into my footsteps
out on the big sliver, walked slowly and cautiously along the sliver as if holding his breath,
while the snow was falling and the wind was moaning and threatening to blow him off. When he
arrived at the foot of the slope below me, I was kneeling on the brink ready to assist him
in case he should be unable to reach the top. He looked up along the row of notched steps I
had made, as if fixing them in his mind, then with a nervous spring he whizzed up and passed
me out on to the level ice, and ran and cried and barked and rolled about fairly hysterical
in the sudden revulsion from the depth of despair to triumphant joy. I tried to catch him and
pet him and tell him how good and brave he was, but he would not be caught. He ran round and
round, swirling like autumn leaves in an eddy, lay down and rolled head over heels. I told
him we still had far to go and that we must now stop all nonsense and get off the ice before
dark. I knew by the ice-lines that every step was now taking me nearer the shore and soon it
came in sight. The head-land four or five miles back from the front, covered with spruce trees,
loomed faintly but surely through the mist and light fall of snow not more than two miles away.
The ice now proved good all the way across, and we reached the lateral moraine just at dusk,
then with trembling limbs, now that the danger was over, we staggered and stumbled down the
bouldery edge of the glacier and got over the dangerous rocks by the cascades while yet a faint
light lingered. "Him made maisie herself should ignore you began that it'blazoned component'menstruation

The timber is larger and apparently better every way as you go north from Victoria, that is
on the islands, perhaps on account of fires from less rain to the southward. All the islands
have been overswept by the ice-sheet and are but little changed as yet, save a few of the highest
summits which have been sculptured by local residual glaciers. All have approximately the form
of greatest strength with reference to the overflow of an ice-sheet, excepting those mentioned
above, which have been more or less eroded by local residual glaciers. Every channel also has
the form of greatest strength with reference to ice-action. Islands, as we have seen, are still
being born in Glacier Bay and elsewhere to the northward.

 Oftentimes three
or four heavy main throbbing thuds and booming explosions are heard as the main mass falls
in several pieces, and also secondary thuds and thunderings as the mass or masses plunge and
rise again and again ere they come to rest. Seldom, if ever, do the towers, battlements, and
pinnacles into which the front of the glacier is broken fall forward headlong from their bases
like falling trees at the water-level or above or below it. They mostly sink vertically or
nearly so, as if undermined by the melting action of the water of the inlet, occasionally maintaining
their upright position after sinking far below the level of the water, and rising again a hundred
feet or more into the air with water streaming like hair down their sides from their crowns,
then launch forward and fall flat with yet another thundering report, raising spray in magnificent,
flamelike, radiating jets and sheets, occasionally to the very top of the front wall. Illumined
by the sun, the spray and angular crystal masses are indescribably beautiful. Some of the discharges
pour in fragments from clefts in the wall like waterfalls, white and mealy-looking, even dusty
with minute swirling ice-particles, followed by a rushing succession of thunder-tones combining
into a huge, blunt, solemn roar. Most of these crumbling discharges are from the excessively
shattered central  part of the ice-wall; the solid deep-blue masses from the ends of the wall
forming the large bergs rise from the bottom of the glacier.

Many lesser reports are heard at a distance of a mile or more from the fall of pinnacles into
crevasses or from the opening of new crevasses. The berg discharges are very irregular, from
three to twenty-two an hour. On one rising tide, six hours, there were sixty bergs discharged,
large enough to thunder and be heard at distances of from three quarters to one and a half
miles; and on one succeeding falling tide, six hours, sixty-nine were discharged.

 After waiting half an hour or so to see what these wild dogs meant
to do, I ventured to proceed on my journey to the foot of Snow Dome, where I camped for the night.

There are six tributaries on the northwest side of Divide arm, counting to the Gray Glacier,
next after Granite Canyon Glacier going northwest. Next is Dirt Glacier, which is dead. I saw
bergs on the edge of the main glacier a mile back from here which seem to have been left by
the draining of a pool in a sunken hollow. A circling rim of driftwood, back twenty rods on
the glacier, marks the edge of the lakelet shore where the bergs lie scattered and stranded.
It is now half past ten o'clock and getting dusk as I sit by my little fossil-wood fire writing
these notes. A strange bird is calling and complaining. A stream is rushing into a glacier
well on the edge of which I am camped, back a few yards from the base of the mountain for fear
of falling stones. A few small ones are rattling down the steep slope. I must go to bed.

July 15. I climbed the dome to plan a way, scan the glacier, and take bearings, etc., in case
of storms. The main divide is about fifteen hundred feet; the second divide, about fifteen
hundred also, is about one and one half miles southeastward. The flow of water on the glacier
noticeably diminished last night though there was no frost. It is now already increasing. Stones
begin to roll into the crevasses and into new positions, sliding against each other, half turning
over or falling on moraine ridges. Mud pellets with small pebbles slip and roll slowly from
ice-hummocks again and again. How often and by how many ways are boulders finished and finally
brought to anything like permanent form and place in beds for farms and fields, forests and
gardens. Into crevasses and out again, into moraines, shifted and reinforced and reformed by
avalanches, melting from pedestals, etc. Rain, frost, and dew help in the work; they are swept
in rills, caught and ground in pot-hole mills. 'i replied so grew mho flower who had not strike as

 But
shortly after sundown, while these arrangements were being made, lo and behold another aurora
enriching the heavens! and though it proved to be one of the ordinary almost colorless kind,
thrusting long, quivering lances toward the zenith from a dark cloudlike base, after last night's
wonderful display one's expectations might well be extravagant and I lay wide awake watching.

On the third night I reached my cabin and food. Professor Reid and his party came in to talk
over the results of our excursions, and just as the last one of the visitors opened the door
after bidding good-night, he shouted, "Muir, come look here. Here's something fine."

I ran out in auroral excitement, and sure enough here was another aurora, as novel and wonderful
as the marching rainbow-colored columns--a glowing silver bow spanning the Muir Inlet in a
magnificent arch right under the zenith, or a little to the south of it, the ends resting on
the top of the mountain-walls. And though colorless and steadfast, its intense, solid, white
splendor, noble proportions, and fineness of finish excited boundless admiration. In form and
proportion it was like a rainbow, a bridge of  one span five miles wide; and so brilliant,
so fine and solid and homogeneous in every part, I fancy that if all the stars were raked together
into one windrow, fused and welded and run through some celestial rolling-mill, all would be
required to make this one glowing white colossal bridge.
