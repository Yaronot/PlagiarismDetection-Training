Concluding Remarks on Colour in Nature.

In the last four chapters I have endeavoured to give a general and systematic, though necessarily
condensed view of the part which is played by colour in the organic world. We have seen in
what infinitely varied ways the need of concealment has led to the modification of animal colours,
whether among polar snows or sandy deserts, in tropical forests or in the abysses of the ocean.
We next find these general adaptations giving way to more specialised types of coloration,
by which each species has become more and more harmonised with its immediate surroundings,
till we reach the most curiously minute resemblances to natural objects in the leaf and stick
insects, and those which are so like flowers or moss or birds' droppings that they deceive
the acutest eye. We have learnt, further, that these varied forms of protective colouring are
far more numerous than has been usually suspected, because, what appear to be very conspicuous
colours or markings when the species is observed in a museum or in a menagerie, are often highly
protective when the creature is seen under the natural conditions of its existence. From these
varied classes of facts it seems not improbable that fully one-half of the species in the animal
kingdom possess colours which have been more or less adapted to secure for them concealment
or protection.

Passing onward we find the explanation of a distinct type of colour or marking, often superimposed
upon protective tints, in the importance of easy recognition by many animals of their fellows,
their parents, or their mates. By this need we have been able to account for markings that
seem calculated to make the animal conspicuous, when the general tints and well-known habits
of the whole group demonstrate the need of concealment. Thus also we are able to explain the
constant symmetry in the markings of wild animals, as well as the numerous cases in which the
conspicuous colours are concealed when at rest and only become visible during rapid motion.
In striking contrast to ordinary protective coloration we have "warning colours," usually very
conspicuous and often brilliant or gaudy, which serve to indicate that their possessors are
either dangerous or uneatable to the usual enemies of their tribe. This kind of coloration
is probably more prevalent than has been hitherto supposed, because in the case of many tropical
animals we are quite unacquainted with their special and most dangerous enemies, and are also
unable to determine whether they are or are not distasteful to those enemies. As a kind of
corollary to the "warning colours," we find the extraordinary phenomena of "mimicry," in which
defenceless species obtain protection by being mistaken for those which, from any cause, possess
immunity from attack. Although a large number of instances of warning colour and of mimicry
are now recorded, it is probably still an almost unworked field of research, more especially
in tropical regions and among the inhabitants of the ocean.

The phenomena of sexual diversities of coloration next engaged our attention, and the reasons
why Mr. Darwin's theory of "sexual selection," as regards colour and ornament, could not be
accepted were stated at some length, together with the theory of animal coloration and ornament
we propose to substitute for it. This theory is held to be in harmony with the general facts
of animal coloration, while it entirely dispenses with the very hypothetical and inadequate
agency of female choice in producing the detailed colours, patterns, and ornaments, which in
so many cases distinguish the male sex.

If my arguments on this point are sound, they will dispose also of Mr. Grant Allen's view of
the direct action of the colour sense on the animal integuments.[161] He argues that the colours
of insects and birds reproduce generally the colours of the flowers they frequent or the fruits
they eat, and he adduces numerous cases in which flower-haunting insects and fruit-eating birds
are gaily coloured. This he supposes to be due to the colour-taste, developed by the constant
presence of bright flowers and fruits, being applied to the selection of each variation towards
brilliancy in their mates; thus in time producing the gorgeous and varied hues they now possess.
Mr. Allen maintains that "insects are bright where bright flowers exist in numbers, and dull
where flowers are rare or inconspicuous;" and he urges that "we can hardly explain this wide
coincidence otherwise than by supposing that a taste for colour is produced through the constant
search for food among entomophilous blossoms, and that this taste has reacted upon its possessors
through the action of unconscious sexual selection."

The examples Mr. Allen quotes of bright insects being associated with bright flowers seem very
forcible, but are really deceptive or erroneous; and quite as many cases could be quoted which
prove the very opposite. For example, in the dense equatorial forests flowers are exceedingly
scarce, and there is no comparison with the amount of floral colour to be met with in our temperate
meadows, woods, and hillsides. The forests about Para in the lower Amazon are typical in this
respect, yet they abound with the most gorgeously coloured butterflies, almost all of which
frequent the forest depths, keeping near the ground, where there is the greatest deficiency
of brilliant flowers. In contrast with this let us take the Cape of Good Hope--the most flowery
region probably that exists upon the globe,--where the country is a complete flower-garden
of heaths, pelargoniums, mesembryanthemus, exquisite iridaceous and other bulbs, and numerous
flowering shrubs and trees; yet the Cape butterflies are hardly equal, either in number or
variety, to those of any country in South Europe, and are utterly insignificant when compared
with those of the comparatively flowerless forest-depths of the Amazon or of New Guinea. Neither
is there any relation between the colours of other insects and their haunts. Few are more gorgeous
than some of the tiger-beetles and the carabi, yet these are all carnivorous; while many of
the most brilliant metallic buprestidae and longicorns are always found on the bark of fallen
trees. So with the humming-birds; their brilliant metallic tints can only be compared with
metals or gems, and are totally unlike the delicate pinks and purples, yellows and reds of
the majority of flowers. Again, the Australian honey-suckers (Meliphagidae) are genuine flower-haunters,
and the Australian flora is more brilliant in colour display than that of most tropical regions,
yet these birds are, as a rule, of dull colours, not superior on the average to our grain-eating
finches. Then, again, we have the grand pheasant family, including the gold and the silver
pheasants, the gorgeous fire-backed and ocellated pheasants, and the resplendent peacock, all
feeding on the ground on grain or seeds or insects, yet adorned with the most gorgeous colours.

There is, therefore, no adequate basis of facts for this theory to rest upon, even if there
were the slightest reason to believe that not only birds, but butterflies and beetles, take
any delight in colour for its own sake, apart from the food-supply of which it indicates the
presence. All that has been proved or that appears to be probable is, that they are able to
perceive differences of colour, and to associate each colour with the particular flowers or
fruits which best satisfy their wants. Special Pen-friend: 361 BOBADIG, Lantana heliconidae 8th.

[Footnote 155: The Rev. George Henslow, in his Origin of Floral Structures, says: "There is
little doubt but that all wind-fertilised angiosperms are degradations from insect-fertilised
flowers.... Poterium sanguisorba is anemophilous; and Sanguisorba officinalis presumably was
so formerly, but has reacquired an entomophilous habit; the whole tribe Poterieae being, in
fact, a degraded group which has descended from Potentilleae. Plantains retain their corolla
but in a degraded form. Junceae are degraded Lilies; while Cyperaceae and Gramineae among monocotyledons
may be ranked with Amentiferae among dicotyledons, as representing orders which have retrograded
very far from the entomophilous forms from which they were possibly and probably descended"
(p. 266).

"The genus Plantago, like Thalictrum minus, Poterium, and others, well illustrate the change
from an entomophilous to the anemophilous state. P. lanceolata has polymorphic flowers, and
is visited by pollen-seeking insects, so that it can be fertilised either by insects or the
wind. P. media illustrates transitions in point of structure, as the filaments are pink, the
anthers motionless, and the pollen grains aggregated, and it is regularly visited by Bombus
terrestris. On the other hand, the slender filaments, versatile anthers, powdery pollen, and
elongated protogynous style are features of other species indicating anemophily; while the
presence of a degraded corolla shows its ancestors to have been entomophilous. P. media, therefore,
illustrates, not a primitive entomophilous condition, but a return to it; just as is the case
with Sanguisorba officinalis and Salix Caprea; but these show no capacity of restoring the
corolla, the attractive features having to be borne by the calyx, which is purplish in Sanguisorba,
by the pink filaments of Plantago, and by the yellow anthers in the Sallow willow" (p. 271).

"The interpretation, then, I would offer of inconspicuousness and all kinds of degradations
is the exact opposite to that of conspicuousness and great differentiations; namely, that species
with minute flowers, rarely or never visited by insects, and habitually self-fertilised, have
primarily arisen through the neglect of insects, and have in consequence assumed their present
floral structures" (p. 282).

In a letter just received from Mr. Henslow, he gives a few additional illustrations of his
views, of which the following are the most important: "Passing to Incompletae, the orders known
collectively as 'Cyclospermeae' are related to Caryophylleae; and to my mind are degradations
from it, of which Orache is anemophilous. Cupuliferae have an inferior ovary and rudimentary
calyx-limb on the top. These, as far as I know, cannot be interpreted except as degradations. We did

The Teachings of the Thousand-Fathom Line.

If now we accept the annexed map as showing us approximately how far beyond their present limits
our continents may have extended during any portion of the Tertiary and Secondary periods,
we shall obtain a foundation of inestimable value for our inquiries into those migrations of
animals and plants during past ages which have resulted in their present peculiarities of distribution.
We see, for instance, that the South American and African continents have always been separated
by nearly as wide an ocean as at present, and that whatever similarities there may be in their
productions must be due to the similar forms having been derived from a common origin in one
of the great northern continents. The radical difference between the higher forms of life of
the two continents accords perfectly with their permanent separation. If there had been any
direct connection between them during Tertiary times, we should hardly have found the deep-seated
differences between the Quadrumana of the two regions--no family even being common to both;
nor the peculiar Insectivora of the one continent, and the equally peculiar Edentata of the
other. The very numerous families of birds quite peculiar to one or other of these continents,
many of which, by their structural isolation and varied development of generic and specific
forms, indicate a high antiquity, equally suggest that there has been no near approach to a
land connection during the same epoch.

Looking to the two great northern continents, we see indications of a possible connection between
them both in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans; and when we remember that from
middle Tertiary times backward--so far as we know continuously to the earliest Palaeozoic epoch--a
temperate and equable climate, with abundant woody vegetation, prevailed up to and within the
arctic circle, we see what facilities may have been afforded for migration from one continent
to the other, sometimes between America and Europe, sometimes between America and Asia. Admitting
these highly probable connections, no bridging of the Atlantic in more southern latitudes (of
which there is not a particle of evidence) will have been necessary to account for all the
intermigration that has occurred between the two continents. If, on the other hand, we remember
how long must have been the route, and how diverse must always have been the conditions between
the more northern and the more southern portions of the American and Euro-Asiatic continents,
we shall not be surprised that many widespread forms in either continent have not crossed into
the other; and that while the skunks (Mephitis), the pouched rats (Saccomyidae), and the turkeys
(Meleagris) are confined to America, the pigs and the hedgehogs, the true flycatchers and the
pheasants are found only in the Euro-Asiatic continent. But, just as there have been periods
which facilitated intermigration between America and the Old World, there have almost certainly
been periods, perhaps of long duration even geologically, when these continents have been separated
by seas as wide as, or even wider than, those of the present day; and thus may be explained
such curious anomalies as the origination of the camel-tribe in America, and its entrance into
Asia in comparatively recent Tertiary times, while the introduction of oxen and bears into
America from the Euro-Asiatic continent appears to have been equally recent.[168]

We shall find on examination that this view of the general permanence of the oceanic and continental
areas, with constant minor fluctuations of land and sea over the whole extent of the latter,
enables us to understand, and offer a rational explanation of, most of the difficult problems
of geographical distribution; and further, that our power of doing this is in direct proportion
to our acquaintance with the distribution of fossil forms of life during the Tertiary period.
We must, also, take due note of many other facts of almost equal importance for a due appreciation
of the problems presented for solution, the most essential being, the various powers of dispersal
possessed by the different groups of animals and plants, the geological antiquity of the species
and genera, and the width and depth of the seas which separate the countries they, inhabit.
A few illustrations will now be given of the way in which these branches of knowledge enable
us to deal with the difficulties and anomalies that present themselves.

The Distribution of Marsupials.

This singular and lowly organised type of mammals constitutes almost the sole representative
of the class in Australia and New Guinea, while it is entirely unknown in Asia, Africa, or
Europe. It reappears in America, where several species of opossums are found; and it was long
thought necessary to postulate a direct southern connection of these distant countries, in
order to account for this curious fact of distribution. When, however, we look to what is known
of the geological history of the marsupials the difficulty vanishes. In the Upper Eocene deposits
of Western Europe the remains of several animals closely allied to the American opossums have
been found; and as, at this period, a very mild climate prevailed far up into the arctic regions,
there is no difficulty in supposing that the ancestors of the group entered America from Europe
or Northern Asia during early Tertiary times.

But we must go much further back for the origin of the Australian marsupials. All the chief
types of the higher mammalia were in existence in the Eocene, if not in the preceding Cretaceous
period, and as we find none of these in Australia, that country must have been finally separated
from the Asiatic continent during the Secondary or Mesozoic period. Now during that period,
in the Upper and the Lower Oolite and in the still older Trias, the jaw-bones of numerous small
mammalia have been found, forming eight distinct genera, which are believed to have been either
marsupials or some allied lowly forms. In North America also, in beds of the Jurassic and Triassic
formations, the remains of an equally great variety of these small mammalia have been discovered;
and from the examination of more than sixty specimens, belonging to at least six distinct genera,
Professor Marsh is of opinion that they represent a generalised type, from which the more specialised
marsupials and insectivora were developed.

From the fact that very similar mammals occur both in Europe and America at corresponding periods,
and in beds which represent a long succession of geological time, and that during the whole
of this time no fragments of any higher forms have been discovered, it seems probable that
both the northern continents (or the larger portion of their area) were then inhabited by no
other mammalia than these, with perhaps other equally low types. It was, probably, not later
than the Jurassic age when some of these primitive marsupials were able to enter Australia,
where they have since remained almost completely isolated; and, being free from the competition
of higher forms, they have developed into the great variety of types we now behold there. These
occupy the place, and have to some extent acquired the form and structure of distinct orders
of the higher mammals--the rodents, the insectivora, and the carnivora,--while still preserving
the essential characteristics and lowly organisation of the marsupials. At a much later period--probably
in late Tertiary times--the ancestors of the various species of rats and mice which now abound
in Australia, and which, with the aerial bats, constitute its only forms of placental mammals,
entered the country from some of the adjacent islands. For this purpose a land connection was
not necessary, as these small creatures might easily be conveyed among the branches or in the
crevices of trees uprooted by floods and carried down to the sea, and then floated to a shore
many miles distant. That no actual land connection with, or very close approximation to, an
Asiatic island has occurred in recent times, is sufficiently proved by the fact that no squirrel,
pig, civet, or other widespread mammal of the Eastern hemisphere has been able to reach the
Australian continent.

The Distribution of Tapirs.

These curious animals form one of the puzzles of geographical distribution, being now confined
to two very remote regions of the globe--the Malay Peninsula and adjacent islands of Sumatra
and Borneo, inhabited by one species, and tropical America, where there are three or four species,
ranging from Brazil to Ecuador and Guatemala. If we considered these living forms only, we
should be obliged to speculate on enormous changes of land and sea in order that these tropical
animals might have passed from one country to the other. But geological discoveries have rendered
all such hypothetical changes unnecessary. During Miocene and Pliocene times tapirs abounded
over the whole of Europe and Asia, their remains having been found in the tertiary deposits
of France, India, Burmah, and China. In both North and South America fossil remains of tapirs
occur only in caves and deposits of Post-Pliocene age, showing that they are comparatively
recent immigrants into that continent. They perhaps entered by the route of Kamchatka and Alaska,
where the climate, even now so much milder and more equable than on the north-east of America,
might have been warm enough in late Pliocene times to have allowed the migration of these animals.
In Asia they were driven southwards by the competition of numerous higher and more powerful
forms, but have found a last resting-place in the swampy forests of the Malay region.

What these Facts Prove.

Now these two cases, of the marsupials and the tapirs, are in the highest degree instructive,
because they show us that, without any hypothetical bridging of deep oceans, and with only
such changes of sea and land as are indicated by the extent of the comparatively shallow seas
surrounding and connecting the existing continents, we are able to account for the anomaly
of allied forms occurring only in remote and widely separated areas. Head, he had establish. "plenty,

 Mr. John Murray of the Challenger Expedition writes to
me that he finds in the deep sea deposits 500 and even 700 miles west of the coast of Africa,
rounded particles of quartz, having a diameter of 1/250 inch, and similar particles are found
at equally great distances from the south-west coasts of Australia; and he considers these
to be atmospheric dust carried to that distance by the wind. Taking the sp. gr. of quartz at
2.6, these particles would weigh about 1/25,000 grain each. These interesting facts can, however,
by no means be taken as indicating the extreme limits of the power of wind in carrying solid
particles. During the Krakatoa eruption no gale of special violence occurred, and the region
is one of comparative calms. The grains of quartz found by Mr. Murray more nearly indicate
the limit, but the very small portions of matter brought up by the dredge, as compared with
the enormous areas of sea-bottom, over which the atmospheric dust must have been scattered,
render it in the highest degree improbable that the maximum limit either of size of particles,
or of distance from land has been reached.

Let us, however, assume that the quartz grains, found by Mr. Murray in the deep-sea ooze 700
miles from land, give us the extreme limit of the power of the atmosphere as a carrier of solid
particles, and let us compare with these the weights of some seeds. From a small collection
of the seeds of thirty species of herbaceous plants sent me from Kew, those in the above table
were selected, and small portions of eight of them carefully weighed in a chemical balance.[175]
By counting these portions I was able to estimate the number of seeds weighing one grain. The
three very minute species, whose numbers are marked with an asterisk (*), were estimated by
the comparison of their sizes with those of the smaller weighed seeds.

If now we compare the seeds with the quartz grains, we find that several are from twice to
three times the weight of the grains found by Mr. Murray, and others five times, eight times,
and fifteen times as heavy; but they are proportionately very much larger, and, being usually
irregular in shape or compressed, they expose a very much larger surface to the air. The surface
is often rough, and several have dilated margins or tailed appendages, increasing friction
and rendering the uniform rate of falling through still air immensely less than in the case
of the smooth, rounded, solid quartz grains. With these advantages it is a moderate estimate
that seeds ten times the weight of the quartz grains could be carried quite as far through
the air by a violent gale and under the most favourable conditions. These limits will include
five of the seeds here given, as well as hundreds of others which do not exceed them in weight;
and to these we may add some larger seeds which have other favourable characteristics, as is
the case with numbers 11-13, which, though very much larger than the rest, are so formed as
in all probability to be still more easily carried great distances by a gale of wind. It appears,
therefore, to be absolutely certain that every autumnal gale capable of conveying solid mineral
particles to great distances, must also carry numbers of small seeds at least as far; and if
this is so, the wind alone will form one of the most effective agents in the dispersal of plants.

Hitherto this mode of conveyance, as applying to the transmission of seeds for great distances
across the ocean, has been rejected by botanists, for two reasons. In the first place, there
is said to be no direct evidence of such conveyance; and, secondly, the peculiar plants of
remote oceanic islands do not appear to have seeds specially adapted for aerial transmission.
I will consider briefly each of these objections.

Objection to the Theory of Wind-Dispersal.

To obtain direct evidence of the transmission of such minute and perishable objects, which
do not exist in great quantities, and are probably carried to the greatest distances but rarely
and as single specimens, is extremely difficult. A bird or insect can be seen if it comes on
board ship, but who would ever detect the seeds of Mimulus or Orchis even if a score of them
fell on a ship's deck? Yet if but one such seed per century were carried to an oceanic island,
that island might become rapidly overrun by the plant, if the conditions were favourable to
its growth and reproduction. It is further objected that search has been made for such seeds,
and they have not been found. Professor Kerner of Innsbruck examined the snow on the surface
of glaciers, and assiduously collected all the seeds he could find, and these were all of plants
which grew in the adjacent mountains or in the same district. In like manner, the plants growing
on moraines were found to be those of the adjacent mountains, plateaux, or lowlands. Hence
he concluded that the prevalent opinion that seeds may be carried through the air for very
great distances "is not supported by fact."[176] The opinion is certainly not supported by
Kerner's facts, but neither is it opposed by them. It is obvious that the seeds that would
be carried by the wind to moraines or to the surface of glaciers would be, first and in the
greatest abundance, those of the immediately surrounding district; then, very much more rarely,
those from more remote mountains; and lastly, in extreme rarity, those from distant countries
or altogether distinct mountain ranges. Them find the Fourth-Gross Interpretation which is summarised it existed

[Footnote 182: A very remarkable case of wind conveyance of seeds on a large scale is described
in a letter from Mr. Thomas Hanbury to his brother, the late Daniel Hanbury, which has been
kindly communicated to me by Mr. Hemsley of Kew. The letter is dated "Shanghai, 1st May 1856,"
and the passage referred to is as follows:--

"For the past three days we have had very warm weather for this time of year, in fact almost
as warm as the middle of summer. Last evening the wind suddenly changed round to the north
and blew all night with considerable violence, making a great change in the atmosphere.

"This morning, myriads of small white particles are floating about in the air; there is not
a single cloud and no mist, yet the sun is quite obscured by this substance, and it looks like
a white fog in England. I enclose thee a sample, thinking it may interest. It is evidently
a vegetable production; I think, apparently, some kind of seed."

Mr. Hemsley adds, that this substance proves to be the plumose seeds of a poplar or willow.

The theory of evolution in the organic world necessarily implies that the forms of animals
and plants have, broadly speaking, progressed from a more generalised to a more specialised
structure, and from simpler to more complex forms. We know, however, that this progression
has been by no means regular, but has been accompanied by repeated degradation and degeneration;
while extinction on an enormous scale has again and again stopped all progress in certain directions,
and has often compelled a fresh start in development from some comparatively low and imperfect
type.

The enormous extension of geological research in recent times has made us acquainted with a
vast number of extinct organisms, so vast that in some important groups--such as the mollusca--the
fossil are more numerous than the living species; while in the mammalia they are not much less
numerous, the preponderance of living species being chiefly in the smaller and in the arboreal
forms which have not been so well preserved as the members of the larger groups. With such
a wealth of material to illustrate the successive stages through which animals have passed,
it will naturally be expected that we should find important evidence of evolution. We should
hope to learn the steps by which some isolated forms have been connected with their nearest
allies, and in many cases to have the gaps filled up which now separate genus from genus, or
species from species. In some cases these expectations are fulfilled, but in many other cases
we seek in vain for evidence of the kind we desire; and this absence of evidence with such
an apparent wealth of material is held by many persons to throw doubt on the theory of evolution
itself. They urge, with much appearance of reason, that all the arguments we have hitherto
adduced fall short of demonstration, and that the crucial test consists in being able to show,
in a great number of cases, those connecting links which we say must have existed. Many of
the gaps that still remain are so vast that it seems incredible to these writers that they
could ever have been filled up by a close succession of species, since these must have spread
over so many ages, and have existed in such numbers, that it seems impossible to account for
their total absence from deposits in which great numbers of species belonging to other groups
are preserved and have been discovered. In order to appreciate the force, or weakness, of these
objections, we must inquire into the character and completeness of that record of the past
life of the earth which geology has unfolded, and ascertain the nature and amount of the evidence
which, under actual conditions, we may expect to find.

The Number of known Species of Extinct Animals.

When we state that the known fossil mollusca are considerably more numerous than those which
now live on the earth, it appears at first sight that our knowledge is very complete, but this
is far from being the case. The species have been continually changing throughout geological
time, and at each period have probably been as numerous as they are now. If we divide the fossiliferous
strata into twelve great divisions--the Pliocene, Miocene, Eocene, Cretaceous, Oolite, Lias,
Trias, Permian, Carboniferous, Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian,--we find not only that each
has a very distinct and characteristic molluscan fauna, but that the different subdivisions
often present a widely different series of species; so that although a certain number of species
are common to two or more of the great divisions, the totality of the species that have lived
upon the earth must be very much more than twelve times--perhaps even thirty or forty times--the
number now living. In like manner, although the species of fossil mammals now recognised by
more or less fragmentary fossil remains may not be much less numerous than the living species,
yet the duration of existence of these was comparatively so short that they were almost completely
changed, perhaps six or seven times, during the Tertiary period; and this is certainly only
a fragment of the geological time during which mammalia existed on the globe.

There is also reason to believe that the higher animals were much more abundant in species
during past geological epochs than now, owing to the greater equability of the climate which
rendered even the arctic regions as habitable as the temperate zones are in our time.

The same equable climate would probably cause a more uniform distribution of moisture, and
render what are now desert regions capable of supporting abundance of animal life. This is
indicated by the number and variety of the species of large animals that have been found fossil
in very limited areas which they evidently inhabited at one period. M. Albert Gaudry found,
in the deposits of a mountain stream at Pikermi in Greece, an abundance of large mammalia such
as are nowhere to be found living together at the present time. Among them were two species
of Mastodon, two different rhinoceroses, a gigantic wild boar, a camel and a giraffe larger
than those now living, several monkeys, carnivora ranging from martens and civets to lions
and hyaenas of the largest size, numerous antelopes of at least five distinct genera, and besides
these many forms altogether extinct. Such were the great herds of Hipparion, an ancestral form
of horse; the Helladotherium, a huge animal bigger than the giraffe; the Ancylotherium, one
of the Edentata; the huge Dinotherium; the Aceratherium, allied to the rhinoceros; and the
monstrous Chalicotherium, allied to the swine and ruminants, but as large as a rhinoceros;
and to prey upon these, the great Machairodus or sabre-toothed tiger. And all these remains
were found in a space 300 paces long by 60 paces broad, many of the species existing in enormous
quantities.

The Pikermi fossils belong to the Upper Miocene formation, but an equally rich deposit of Upper
Eocene age has been discovered in South-Western France at Quercy, where M. Filhol has determined
the presence of no less than forty-two species of beasts of prey alone. Equally remarkable
are the various discoveries of mammalian fossils in North America, especially in the old lake
bottoms now forming what are called the "bad lands" of Dakota and Nebraska, belonging to the
Miocene period. Here are found an enormous assemblage of remains, often perfect skeletons,
of herbivora and carnivora, as varied and interesting as those from the localities already
referred to in Europe; but altogether distinct, and far exceeding, in number and variety of
species of the larger animals, the whole existing fauna of North America. Very similar phenomena
occur in South America and in Australia, leading us to the conclusion that the earth at the
present time is impoverished as regards the larger animals, and that at each successive period
of Tertiary time, at all events, it contained a far greater number of species than now inhabit
it. The very richness and abundance of the remains which we find in limited areas, serve to
convince us how imperfect and fragmentary must be our knowledge of the earth's fauna at any
one past epoch; since we cannot believe that all, or nearly all, of the animals which inhabited
any district were entombed in a single lake, or overwhelmed by the floods of a single river.

But the spots where such rich deposits occur are exceedingly few and far between when compared
with the vast areas of continental land, and we have every reason to believe that in past ages,
as now, numbers of curious species were rare or local, the commoner and more abundant species
giving a very imperfect idea of the existing series of animal forms. Yet more important, as
showing the imperfection of our knowledge, is the enormous lapse of time between the several
formations in which we find organic remains in any abundance, so vast that in many cases we
find ourselves almost in a new world, all the species and most of the genera of the higher
animals having undergone a complete change.

Causes of the Imperfection of the Geological Record.

These facts are quite in accordance with the conclusions of geologists as to the necessary
imperfection of the geological record, since it requires the concurrence of a number of favourable
conditions to preserve any adequate representation of the life of a given epoch. In the first
place, the animals to be preserved must not die a natural death by disease, or old age, or
by being the prey of other animals, but must be destroyed by some accident which shall lead
to their being embedded in the soil. They must be either carried away by floods, sink into
bogs or quicksands, or be enveloped in the mud or ashes of a volcanic eruption; and when thus
embedded they must remain undisturbed amid all the future changes of the earth's surface.

But the chances against this are enormous, because denudation is always going on, and the rocks
we now find at the earth's surface are only a small fragment of those which were originally
laid down. The alternations of marine and freshwater deposits, and the frequent unconformability
of strata with those which overlie them, tell us plainly of repeated elevations and depressions
of the surface, and of denudation on an enormous scale. Almost every mountain range, with its
peaks, ridges, and valleys, is but the remnant of some vast plateau eaten away by sub-aerial
agencies; every range of sea-cliffs tell us of long slopes of land destroyed by the waves;
while almost all the older rocks which now form the surface of the earth have been once covered
with newer deposits which have long since disappeared. Nowhere are the evidences of this denudation
more apparent than in North and South America, where granitic or metamorphic rocks cover an
area hardly less than that of all Europe. The same rocks are largely developed in Central Africa
and Eastern Asia; while, besides those portions that appear exposed on the surface, areas of
unknown extent are buried under strata which rest on them uncomformably, and could not, therefore,
constitute the original capping under which the whole of these rocks must once have been deeply
buried; because granite can only be formed, and metamorphism can only go on, deep down in the
crust of the earth. What an overwhelming idea does this give us of the destruction of whole
piles of rock, miles in thickness and covering areas comparable with those of continents; and
how great must have been the loss of the innumerable fossil forms which those rocks contained!
In view of such destruction we are forced to conclude that our palaeontological collections,
rich though they may appear, are really but small and random samples, giving no adequate idea
of the mighty series of organism which have lived upon the earth.[183]

Admitting, however, the extreme imperfection of the geological record as a whole, it may be
urged that certain limited portions of it are fairly complete--as, for example, the various
Miocene deposits of India, Europe, and North America,--and that in these we ought to find many
examples of species and genera linked together by intermediate forms. (with "," be gained in which

     Of these the Irish elk
    disappeared in the Prehistoric age, after having lived in
    countless herds in Ireland, while the rest have lived on into
    our own times in Euro-Asia, and, with the exception of the last,
    also in North America.

    "From this survey it is obvious that the cervine antlers have
    increased in size and complexity from the Mid-Miocene to the
    Pleistocene age, and that their successive changes are analogous
    to those which are observed in the development of antlers in the
    living deer, which begin with a simple point, and increase in
    number of tines till their limit of growth be reached. In other
    words, the development of antlers indicated at successive and
    widely-separated pages of the geological record is the same as
    that observed in the history of a single living species. It is
    also obvious that the progressive diminution of size and
    complexity in the antlers, from the present time back into the
    early Tertiary age, shows that we are approaching the zero of
    antler development in the Mid-Miocene. No trace of any
    antler-bearing ruminant has been met with in the lower Miocenes,
    either of Europe or the United States."[188]

Progressive Brain-Development.

The three illustrations now given sufficiently prove that, whenever the geological record approaches
to completeness, we have evidence of the progressive change of species in definite directions,
and from less developed to more developed types--exactly such a change as we may expect to
find if the evolution theory be the true one. Many other illustrations of a similar change
could be given, but the animal groups in which they occur being less familiar, the details
would be less interesting, and perhaps hardly intelligible. There is, however, one very remarkable
proof of development that must be briefly noticed--that afforded by the steady increase in
the size of the brain. This may be best stated in the words of Professor Marsh:--

    "The real progress of mammalian life in America, from the
    beginning of the Tertiary to the present, is well illustrated by
    the brain-growth, in which we have the key to many other
    changes. The earliest known Tertiary mammals all had very small
    brains, and in some forms this organ was proportionally less
    than in certain reptiles. There was a gradual increase in the
    size of the brain during this period, and it is interesting to
    find that this growth was mainly confined to the cerebral
    hemispheres, or higher portion of the brain. In most groups of
    mammals the brain has gradually become more convoluted, and thus
    increased in quality as well as quantity. In some also the
    cerebellum and olfactory lobes, the lower parts of the brain,
    have even diminished in size. In the long struggle for existence
    during Tertiary time the big brains won, then as now; and the
    increasing power thus gained rendered useless many structures
    inherited from primitive ancestors, but no longer adapted to new
    conditions."

This remarkable proof of development in the organ of the mental faculties, forms a fitting
climax to the evidence already adduced of the progressive evolution of the general structure
of the body, as illustrated by the bony skeleton. We now pass on to another class of facts
equally suggestive of evolution.

The Local Relations of Fossil and Living Animals.

If all existing animals have been produced from ancestral forms--mostly extinct--under the
law of variation and natural selection, we may expect to find in most cases a close relation
between the living forms of each country and those which inhabited it in the immediately preceding
epoch. But if species have originated in some quite different way, either by any kind of special
creation, or by sudden advances of organisation in the offspring of preceding types, such close
relationship would not be found; and facts of this kind become, therefore, to some extent a
test of evolution under natural selection or some other law of gradual change. Of course the
relationship will not appear when extensive migration has occurred, by which the inhabitants
of one region have been able to take possession of another region, and destroy or drive out
its original inhabitants, as has sometimes happened. But such cases are comparatively rare,
except where great changes of climate are known to have occurred; and we usually do find a
remarkable continuity between the existing fauna and flora of a country and those of the immediately
preceding age. A few of the more remarkable of these cases will now be briefly noticed.

The mammalian fauna of Australia consists, as is well known, wholly of the lowest forms--the
Marsupials and Monotremata--except only a few species of mice. This is accounted for by the
complete isolation of the country from the Asiatic continent during the whole period of the
development of the higher animals. At some earlier epoch the ancestral marsupials, which abounded
both in Europe and North America in the middle of the Secondary period, entered the country,
and have since remained there, free from the competition of higher forms, and have undergone
a special development in accordance with the peculiar conditions of a limited area. While in
the large continents higher forms of mammalia have been developed, which have almost or wholly
exterminated the less perfect marsupials, in Australia these latter have become modified into
such varied forms as the leaping kangaroos, the burrowing wombats, the arboreal phalangers,
the insectivorous bandicoots, and the carnivorous Dasyuridae or native cats, culminating in
the Thylacinus or "tiger-wolf" of Tasmania--animals as unlike each other as our sheep, rabbits,
squirrels, and dogs, but all retaining the characteristic features of the marsupial type.

Now in the caves and late Tertiary or Post-Tertiary deposits of Australia the remains of many
extinct mammalia have been found, but all are marsupials. There are many kangaroos, some larger
than any living species, and others more allied to the tree-kangaroos of New Guinea; a large
wombat as large as a tapir; the Diprotodon, a thick-limbed kangaroo the size of a rhinoceros
or small elephant; and a quite different animal, the Nototherium, nearly as large. The carnivorous
Thylacinus of Tasmania is also found fossil; and a huge phalanger, Thylacoleo, the size of
a lion, believed by Professor Owen and by Professor Oscar Schmidt to have been equally carnivorous
and destructive.[189] Besides these, there are many other species more resembling the living
forms both in size and structure, of which they may be, in some cases, the direct ancestors.
Two species of extinct Echidna, belonging to the very low Monotremata, have also been found
in New South Wales.

Next to Australia, South America possesses the most remarkable assemblage of peculiar mammals,
in its numerous Edentata--the sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos; its rodents, such as the
cavies and chinchillas; its marsupial opossums, and its quadrumana of the family Cebidae. Remains
of extinct species of all these have been found in the caves of Brazil, of Post-Pliocene age;
while in the earlier Pliocene deposits of the pampas many distinct genera of these groups have
been found, some of gigantic size and extraordinary form. There are armadillos of many types,
some being as large as elephants; gigantic sloths of the genera Megatherium, Megalonyx, Mylodon,
Lestodon, and many others; rodents belonging to the American families Cavidae and Chinchillidae;
and ungulates allied to the llama; besides many other extinct forms of intermediate types or
of uncertain affinities.[190] The extinct Moas of New Zealand--huge wingless birds allied to
the living Apteryx--illustrate the same general law.

The examples now quoted, besides illustrating and enforcing the general fact of evolution,
throw some light on the usual character of the modification and progression of animal forms.
In the cases where the geological record is tolerably complete, we find a continuous development
of some kind--either in complexity of ornamentation, as in the fossil Paludinas of the Hungarian
lake-basins; in size and in the specialisation of the feet and teeth, as in the American fossil
horses; or in the increased development of the branching horns, as in the true deer. Council, churchman

 Of Lepidoptera, Sphingidae and Tineidae have been found in the Oolite;
while ants, representing the highly specialised Hymenoptera, have occurred in the Purbeck and Lias.

This remarkable identity of the families of very ancient with those of existing insects is
quite comparable with the apparently sudden appearance of existing genera of trees in the Cretaceous
epoch. In both cases we feel certain that we must go very much farther back in order to find
the ancestral forms from which they were developed, and that at any moment some fresh discovery
may revolutionise our ideas as to the antiquity of certain groups. Such a discovery was made
while Mr. Scudder's work was passing through the press. Up to that date all the existing orders
of true insects appeared to have originated in the Trias, the alleged moth and beetle of the
Coal formation having been incorrectly determined. But now, undoubted remains of beetles have
been found in the Coal measures of Silesia, thus supporting the interpretation of the borings
in carboniferous trees as having been made by insects of this order, and carrying back this
highly specialised form of insect life well into Palaeozoic times. Such a discovery renders
all speculation as to the origin of true insects premature, because we may feel sure that all
the other orders of insects, except perhaps hymenoptera and lepidoptera, were contemporaneous
with the highly specialised beetles.

The less highly organised terrestrial arthropoda--the Arachnida and Myriapoda--are, as might
be expected, much more ancient. A fossil spider has been found in the Carboniferous, and scorpions
in the Upper Silurian rocks of Scotland, Sweden, and the United States. Myriapoda have been
found abundantly in the Carboniferous and Devonian formations; but all are of extinct orders,
exhibiting a more generalised structure than living forms.

Much more extraordinary, however, is the presence in the Palaeozoic formations of ancestral
forms of true insects, termed by Mr. Scudder Palaeodictyoptera. They consist of generalised
cockroaches and walking-stick insects (Orthopteroidea); ancient mayflies and allied forms,
of which there are six families and more than thirty genera (Neuropteroidea); three genera
of Hemipteroidea resembling various Homoptera and Hemiptera, mostly from the Carboniferous
formation, a few from the Devonian, and one ancestral cockroach (Palaeoblattina) from the Middle
Silurian sandstone of France. If this occurrence of a true hexapod insect from the Middle Silurian
be really established, taken in connection with the well-defined Coleoptera from the Carboniferous,
the origin of the entire group of terrestrial arthropoda is necessarily thrown back into the
Cambrian epoch, if not earlier. And this cannot be considered improbable in view of the highly
differentiated land plants--ferns, equisetums, and lycopods--in the Middle or Lower Silurian,
and even a conifer (Cordaites Robbii) in the Upper Silurian; while the beds of graphite in
the Laurentian were probably formed from terrestrial vegetation.

On the whole, then, we may affirm that, although the geological record of the insect life of
the earth is exceptionally imperfect, it yet decidedly supports the evolution hypothesis. The
most specialised order, Lepidoptera, is the most recent, only dating back to the Oolite; the
Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Homoptera go as far as the Lias; while the Orthoptera and Neuroptera
extend to the Trias. The recent discovery of Coleoptera in the Carboniferous shows, however,
that the preceding limits are not absolute, and will probably soon be overpassed. Only the
more generalised ancestral forms of winged insects have been traced back to Silurian time,
and along with them the less highly organised scorpions; facts which serve to show us the extreme
imperfection of our knowledge, and indicate possibilities of a world of terrestrial life in
the remotest Palaeozoic times.

Geological Succession of Vertebrata.

The lowest forms of vertebrates are the fishes, and these appear first in the geological record
in the Upper Silurian formation. The most ancient known fish is a Pteraspis, one of the bucklered
ganoids or plated fishes--by no means a very low type--allied to the sturgeon (Accipenser)
and alligator-gar (Lepidosteus), but, as a group, now nearly extinct. Almost equally ancient
are the sharks, which under various forms still abound in our seas. We cannot suppose these
to be nearly the earliest fishes, especially as the two lowest orders, now represented by the
Amphioxus or lancelet and the lampreys, have not yet been found fossil. The ganoids were greatly
developed in the Devonian era, and continued till the Cretaceous, when they gave way to the
true osseous fishes, which had first appeared in the Jurassic period, and have continued to
increase till the present day. This much later appearance of the higher osseous fishes is quite
in accordance with evolution, although some of the very lowest forms, the lancelet and the
lampreys, together with the archaic ceratodus, have survived to our time.

The Amphibia, represented by the extinct labyrinthodons, appear first in the Carboniferous
rocks, and these peculiar forms became extinct early in the Secondary period. The labyrinthodons
were, however, highly specialised, and do not at all indicate the origin of the class, which
may be as ancient as the lower forms of fishes. Hardly any recognisable remains of our existing
groups--the frogs, toads, and salamanders--are found before the Tertiary period, a fact which
indicates the extreme imperfection of the record as regards this class of animals.

True reptiles have not been found till we reach the Permian where Prohatteria and Proterosaurus
occur, the former closely allied to the lizard-like Sphenodon of New Zealand, the latter having
its nearest allies in the same group of reptiles--Rhyncocephala, other forms of which occur
in the Trias. In this last-named formation the earliest crocodiles--Phytosaurus (Belodon) and
Stagonolepis occur, as well as the earliest tortoises--Chelytherium, Proganochelys, and Psephoderma.[195]
Fossil serpents have been first found in the Cretaceous formation, but the conditions for the
preservation of these forms have evidently been unfavourable, and the record is correspondingly
incomplete. The marine Plesiosauri and Ichthyosauri, the flying Pterodactyles, the terrestrial
Iguanodon of Europe, and the huge Atlantosaurus of Colorado--the largest land animal that has
ever lived upon the earth[196]--all belong to special developments of the reptilian type which
flourished during the Secondary epoch, and then became extinct.

Birds are among the rarest of fossils, due, no doubt, to their aerial habits removing them
from the ordinary dangers of flood, bog, or ice which overwhelm mammals and reptiles, and also
to their small specific gravity which keeps them floating on the surface of water till devoured.
Their remains were long confined to Tertiary deposits, where many living genera and a few extinct
forms have been found. The only birds yet known from the older rocks are the toothed birds
(Odontornithes) of the Cretaceous beds of the United States, belonging to two distinct families
and many genera; a penguin-like form (Enaliornis) from the Upper Greensand of Cambridge; and
the well-known long-tailed Archaeopteryx from the Upper Oolite of Bavaria. The record is thus
imperfect and fragmentary in the extreme; but it yet shows us, in the few birds discovered
in the older rocks, more primitive and generalised types, while the Tertiary birds had already
become specialised like those living, and had lost both the teeth and the long vertebral tail,
which indicate reptilian affinities in the earlier Mammalia have been found, as already stated,
as far back as the Trias formation, in Europe in the United States and in South Africa, all
being very small, and belonging either to the Marsupial order, or to some still lower and more
generalised type, out of which both Marsupials and Insectivora were developed. Other allied
forms have been found in the Lower and Upper Oolite both of Europe and the United States. The thrusts,

 The two very strongest cases he mentions are the twenty-nine species of
American trees which all differed in a corresponding way from their nearest European allies;
and the American maize which became changed after three generations in Europe. But in the case
of the trees the differences alleged may be partly due to correlation with constitutional peculiarities
dependent on climate, especially as regards the deeper tint of the fading leaves and the smaller
size of the buds and seeds in America than in Europe; while the less deeply toothed or serrated
leaves in the American species are, in our present complete ignorance of the causes and uses
of serration, quite as likely to be due to some form of adaptation as to any direct action
of the climate. Again, we are not told how many of the allied species do not vary in this particular
manner, and this is certainly an important factor in any conclusion we may form on the question.

In the case of the maize it appears that one of the more remarkable and highly selected American
varieties was cultivated in Germany, and in three years nearly all resemblance to the original
parent was lost; and in the sixth year it closely resembled a common European variety, but
was of somewhat more vigorous growth. In this case no selection appears to have been practised,
and the effects may have been due to that "reversion to mediocrity" which invariably occurs,
and is more especially marked in the case of varieties which have been rapidly produced by
artificial selection. It may be considered as a partial reversion to the wild or unimproved
stock; and the same thing would probably have occurred, though perhaps less rapidly, in America
itself. As this is stated by Darwin to be the most remarkable case known to him "of the direct
and prompt action of climate on a plant," we must conclude that such direct effects have not
been proved to be accumulated by inheritance, independently of reversion or selection.

The remaining part of Mr. Spencer's essay is devoted to a consideration of the hypothetical
action of the environment on the lower organisms which consist of simple cells or formless
masses of protoplasm; and he shows with great elaboration that the outer and inner parts of
these are necessarily subject to different conditions; and that the outer actions of air or
water lead to the formation of integuments, and sometimes to other definite modifications of
the surface, whence arise permanent differences of structure. Although in these cases also
it is very difficult to determine how much is due to direct modification by external agencies
transmitted and accumulated by inheritance, and how much to spontaneous variations accumulated
by natural selection, the probabilities in favour of the former mode of action are here greater,
because there is no differentiation of nutritive and reproductive cells in these simple organisms;
and it can be readily seen that any change produced in the latter will almost certainly affect
the next generation.[201] We are thus carried back almost to the origin of life, and can only
vaguely speculate on what took place under conditions of which we know so little.

 This law has been epitomised by Spencer as the 'survival of the fittest.' This neat
expression no doubt covers the case, but it leaves the origin of the fittest entirely untouched.
Darwin assumes a 'tendency to variation' in nature, and it is plainly necessary to do this,
in order that materials for the exercise of a selection should exist. Darwin and Wallace's
law is then only restrictive, directive, conservative, or destructive of something already
created. I propose, then, to seek for the originative laws by which these subjects are furnished;
in other words, for the causes of the origin of the fittest."[203]

Mr. Cope lays great stress on the existence of a special developmental force termed "bathmism"
or growth-force, which acts by means of retardation and acceleration "without any reference
to fitness at all;" that "instead of being controlled by fitness it is the controller of fitness."
He argues that "all the characteristics of generalised groups from genera up (excepting, perhaps,
families) have been evolved under the law of acceleration and retardation," combined with some
intervention of natural selection; and that specific characters, or species, have been evolved
by natural selection with some assistance from the higher law. He, therefore, makes species
and genera two absolutely distinct things, the latter not developed out of the former; generic
characters and specific characters are, in his opinion, fundamentally different, and have had
different origins, and whole groups of species have been simultaneously modified, so as to
belong to another genus; whence he thinks it "highly probable that the same specific form has
existed through a succession of genera, and perhaps in different epochs of geologic time."

Useful characters, he concludes, have been produced by the special location of growth-force
by use; useless ones have been produced by location of growth-force without the influence of
use. Another element which determines the direction of growth-force, and which precedes use,
is effort; and "it is thought that effort becomes incorporated into the metaphysical acquisitions
of the parent, and is inherited with other metaphysical qualities by the young, which, during
the period of growth, is much more susceptible to modifying influences, and is likely to exhibit
structural change in consequence."[204]

From these few examples of their teachings, it is clear that these American evolutionists have
departed very widely from the views of Mr. Darwin, and in place of the well-established causes
and admitted laws to which he appeals have introduced theoretical conceptions which have not
yet been tested by experiments or facts, as well as metaphysical conceptions which are incapable
of proof. And when they come to illustrate these views by an appeal to palaeontology or morphology,
we find that a far simpler and more complete explanation of the facts is afforded by the established
principles of variation and natural selection. The confidence with which these new ideas are
enunciated, and the repeated assertion that without them Darwinism is powerless to explain
the origin of organic forms, renders it necessary to bestow a little more time on the explanations
they give us of well-known phenomena with which, they assert, other theories are incompetent
to grapple.

As examples of use producing structural change, Mr. Cope adduces the hooked and toothed beaks
of the falcons and the butcher-birds, and he argues that the fact of these birds belonging
to widely different groups proves that similarity of use has produced a similar structural
result. But no attempt is made to show any direct causal connection between the use of a bill
to cut or tear flesh and the development of a tooth on the mandible. Such use might conceivably
strengthen the bill or increase its size, but not cause a special tooth-like outgrowth which
was not present in the ancestral thrush-like forms of the butcher-bird. On the other hand,
it is clear that any variations of the bill tending towards a hook or tooth would give the
possessor some advantage in seizing and tearing its prey, and would thus be preserved and increased
by natural selection. Again, Mr. Cope urges the effects of a supposed "law of polar or centrifugal
growth" to counteract a tendency to unsymmetrical growth, where one side of the body is used
more than the other. But the undoubted hurtfulness of want of symmetry in many important actions
or functions would rapidly eliminate any such tendency. When, however, it has become useful,
as in the case of the single enlarged claw of many Crustacea, it has been preserved by natural
selection.

Origin of the Feet of the Ungulates.

Perhaps the most original and suggestive of Mr. Cope's applications of the theory of use and
effort in modifying structure are, his chapters "On the Origin of the Foot-Structure of the
Ungulates;" and that "On the Effect of Impacts and Strains on the Feet of Mammalia;" and they
will serve also to show the comparative merits of this theory and that of natural selection
in explaining a difficult case of modification, especially as it is an explanation claimed
as new and original when first enunciated in 1881. Let us, then, see how he deals with the problem.

The remarkable progressive change of a four or five-toed ancestor into the one-toed horse,
and the equally remarkable division of the whole group of ungulate animals into the odd-toed
and even-toed divisions, Mr. Cope attempts to explain by the effects of impact and use among
animals which frequented hard or swampy ground respectively. On hard ground, it is urged, the
long middle toe would be most used and subjected to the greatest strains, and would therefore
acquire both strength and development. Pakeha maori was not future, many'dell, were persevering

Yes: but how does any objects and centuries?

 Any direct action of the environment, or any characters acquired by use or
disuse, can have no effect whatever upon the race unless they are inherited; and that they
are inherited in any case, except when they directly affect the reproductive cells, has not
been proved. On the other hand, as we shall presently show, there is much reason for believing
that such acquired characters are in their nature non-heritable.

Variation and Selection Overpower the Effects of Use and Disuse.

But there is another objection to this theory arising from the very nature of the effects produced.
In each generation the effects of use or disuse, or of effort, will certainly be very small,
while of this small effect it is not maintained that the whole will be always inherited by
the next generation. How small the effect is we have no means of determining, except in the
case of disuse, which Mr. Darwin investigated carefully. He found that in twelve fancy breeds
of pigeons, which are often kept in aviaries, or if free fly but little, the sternum had been
reduced by about one-seventh or one-eighth of its entire length, and that of the scapula about
one-ninth. In domestic ducks the weight of the wing-bones in proportion to that of the whole
skeleton had decreased about one-tenth. In domestic rabbits the bones of the legs were found
to have increased in weight in due proportion to the increased weight of the body, but those
of the hind legs were rather less in proportion to those of the fore legs than in the wild
animal, a difference which may be imputed to their being less used in rapid motion. The pigeons,
therefore, afford the greatest amount of reduction by disuse--one-seventh of the length of
the sternum. But the pigeon has certainly been domesticated four or five thousand years; and
if the reduction of the wings by disuse has only been going on for the last thousand years,
the amount of reduction in each generation would be absolutely imperceptible, and quite within
the limits of the reduction due to the absence of selection, as already explained. But, as
we have seen in Chapter III, the fortuitous variation of every part or organ usually amounts
to one-tenth, and often to one-sixth of the average dimensions--that is, the fortuitous variation
in one generation among a limited number of the individuals of a species is as great as the
cumulative effects of disuse in a thousand generations! If we assume that the effects of use
or of effort in the individual are equal to the effects of disuse, or even ten or a hundred
times greater, they will even then not equal, in each generation, the amount of the fortuitous
variations of the same part. If it be urged that the effects of use would modify all the individuals
of a species, while the fortuitous variations to the amount named only apply to a portion of
them, it may be replied, that that portion is sufficiently large to afford ample materials
for selection, since it often equals the numbers that can annually survive; while the recurrence
in each successive generation of a like amount of variation would render possible such a rapid
adjustment to new conditions that the effects of use or disuse would be as nothing in comparison.
It follows, that even admitting the modifying effects of the environment, and that such modifications
are inherited, they would yet be entirely swamped by the greater effects of fortuitous variation,
and the far more rapid cumulative results of the selection of such variations.

Supposed Action of the Environment in Initiating Variations.

It is, however, urged that the reaction of the environment initiates variations, which without
it would never arise; such, for instance, as the origin of horns through the pressures and
irritations caused by butting, or otherwise using the head as a weapon or for defence. Admitting,
for the sake of argument, that this is so, all the evidence we possess shows that, from the
very first appearance of the rudiment of such an organ, it would vary to a greater extent than
the amount of growth directly produced by use; and these variations would be subject to selection,
and would thus modify the organ in ways which use alone would never bring about. We have seen
that this has been the case with the branching antlers of the stag, which have been modified
by selection, so as to become useful in other ways than as a mere weapon; and the same has
almost certainly been the case with the variously curved and twisted horns of antelopes. In
like manner, every conceivable rudiment would, from its first appearance, be subject to the
law of variation and selection, to which, thenceforth, the direct effect of the environment
would be altogether subordinate.

A very similar mode of reasoning will apply to the other branch of the subject--the initiation
of structures and organs by the action of the fundamental laws of growth. Admitting that such
laws have determined some of the main divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdom, have originated
certain important organs, and have been the fundamental cause of certain lines of development,
yet at every step of the process these laws must have acted in entire subordination to the
law of natural selection. No modification thus initiated could have advanced a single step,
unless it were, on the whole, a useful modification; while its entire future course would be
necessarily subject to the laws of variation and selection, by which it would be sometimes
checked, sometimes hastened on, sometimes diverted to one purpose, sometimes to another, according
as the needs of the organism, under the special conditions of its existence, required such
modification. We need not deny that such laws and influences may have acted in the manner suggested,
but what we do deny is that they could possibly escape from the ever-present and all-powerful
modifying effects of variation and natural selection.[212]

Weismann's Theory of Heredity.

Professor August Weismann has put forth a new theory of heredity founded upon the "continuity
of the germ-plasm," one of the logical consequences of which is, that acquired characters of
whatever kind are not transmitted from parent to offspring. 'Botanique'(valuable), i is call in distribution,

Since this chapter was written my attention has been directed to Mr. Francis Galton's Theory
of Heredity (already referred to at p. 417) which was published thirteen years ago as an alternative
for Darwin's theory of pangenesis.

Mr. Galton's theory, although it attracted little attention, appears to me to be substantially
the same as that of Professor Weismann. Galton's "stirp" is Weismann's "germ-plasm." Galton
supposes the sexual elements in the offspring to be directly formed from the residue of the
stirp not used up in the development of the body of the parent--Weismann's "continuity of the
germ-plasm." Galton also draws many of the same conclusions from his theory. He maintains that
characters acquired by the individual as the result of external influences cannot be inherited,
unless such influences act directly on the reproductive elements--instancing the possible heredity
of alcoholism, because the alcohol permeates the tissues and may reach the sexual elements.
He discusses the supposed heredity of effects produced by use or disuse, and explains them
much in the same manner as does Weismann. Galton is an anthropologist, and applies the theory,
mainly, to explain the peculiarities of hereditary transmission in man, many of which peculiarities
he discusses and elucidates. Weismann is a biologist, and is mostly concerned with the application
of the theory to explain variation and instinct, and to the further development of the theory
of evolution. He has worked it out more thoroughly, and has adduced embryological evidence
in its support; but the views of both writers are substantially the same, and their theories
were arrived at quite independently.

Our review of modern Darwinism might fitly have terminated with the preceding chapter; but
the immense interest that attaches to the origin of the human race, and the amount of misconception
which prevails regarding the essential teachings of Darwin's theory on this question, as well
as regarding my own special views upon it, induce me to devote a final chapter to its discussion.

To any one who considers the structure of man's body, even in the most superficial manner,
it must be evident that it is the body of an animal, differing greatly, it is true, from the
bodies of all other animals, but agreeing with them in all essential features. The bony structure
of man classes him as a vertebrate; the mode of suckling his young classes him as a mammal;
his blood, his muscles, and his nerves, the structure of his heart with its veins and arteries,
his lungs and his whole respiratory and circulatory systems, all closely correspond to those
of other mammals, and are often almost identical with them. He possesses the same number of
limbs terminating in the same number of digits as belong fundamentally to the mammalian class.
His senses are identical with theirs, and his organs of sense are the same in number and occupy
the same relative position. Every detail of structure which is common to the mammalia as a
class is found also in man, while he only differs from them in such ways and degrees as the
various species or groups of mammals differ from each other. If, then, we have good reason
to believe that every existing group of mammalia has descended from some common ancestral form--as
we saw to be so completely demonstrated in the case of the horse tribe,--and that each family,
each order, and even the whole class must similarly have descended from some much more ancient
and more generalised type, it would be in the highest degree improbable--so improbable as to
be almost inconceivable--that man, agreeing with them so closely in every detail of his structure,
should have had some quite distinct mode of origin. Let us, then, see what other evidence bears
upon the question, and whether it is sufficient to convert the probability of his animal origin
into a practical certainty.

Rudiments and Variations as Indicating the Relation of Man to other Mammals.

All the higher animals present rudiments of organs which, though useless to them, are useful
in some allied group, and are believed to have descended from a common ancestor in which they
were useful. Thus there are in ruminants rudiments of incisor teeth which, in some species,
never cut through the gums; many lizards have external rudimentary legs; while many birds,
as the Apteryx, have quite rudimentary wings. Now man possesses similar rudiments, sometimes
constantly, sometimes only occasionally present, which serve intimately to connect his bodily
structure with that of the lower animals. Many animals, for example, have a special muscle
for moving or twitching the skin. In man there are remnants of this in certain parts of the
body, especially in the forehead, enabling us to raise our eyebrows; but some persons have
it in other parts. A few persons are able to move the whole scalp so as to throw off any object
placed on the head, and this property has been proved, in one case, to be inherited. In the
outer fold of the ear there is sometimes a projecting point, corresponding in position to the
pointed ear of many animals, and believed to be a rudiment of it. In the alimentary canal there
is a rudiment--the vermiform appendage of the caecum--which is not only useless, but is sometimes
a cause of disease and death in man; yet in many vegetable feeding animals it is very long,
and even in the orang-utan it is of considerable length and convoluted. So, man possesses rudimentary
bones of a tail concealed beneath the skin, and, in some rare cases, this forms a minute external
tail.

The variability of every part of man's structure is very great, and many of these variations
tend to approximate towards the structure of other animals. The courses of the arteries are
eminently variable, so that for surgical purposes it has been necessary to determine the probable
proportion of each variation. The muscles are so variable that in fifty cases the muscles of
the foot were found to be not strictly alike in any two, and in some the deviations were considerable;
while in thirty-six subjects Mr. J. Wood observed no fewer than 558 muscular variations.

The progressive development of any vertebrate from the ovum or minute embryonic egg affords
one of the most marvellous chapters in Natural History. We see the contents of the ovum undergoing
numerous definite changes, its interior dividing and subdividing till it consists of a mass
of cells, then a groove appears marking out the median line or vertebral column of the future
animal, and thereafter are slowly developed the various essential organs of the body. Is he
developed in a different way from other mammals, as we should certainly expect if he has had
a distinct and altogether different origin? Startling as this last assertion may appear to
be, it is demonstrably true, and it alone appears to me sufficient to place beyond all doubt
the structural unity of man with the rest of the animal world, and more particularly and closely
with the apes."[220]

A few of the curious details in which man passes through stages common to the lower animals
may be mentioned. In the seventh month the convolutions of the brain resemble those of an adult
baboon. The great toe, so characteristic of man, forming the fulcrum which most assists him
in standing erect, in an early stage of the embryo is much shorter than the other toes, and
instead of being parallel with them, projects at an angle from the side of the foot, thus corresponding
with its permanent condition in the quadrumana. Numerous other examples might be quoted, all
illustrating the same general law.

Diseases Common to Man and the Lower Animals.

Though the fact is so well known, it is certainly one of profound significance that many animal
diseases can be communicated to man, since it shows similarity, if not identity, in the minute
structure of the tissues, the nature of the blood, the nerves, and the brain. Such diseases
as hydrophobia, variola, the glanders, cholera, herpes, etc., can be transmitted from animals
to man or the reverse; while monkeys are liable to many of the same non-contagious diseases
as we are. These facts show the similarity of the nerves of taste in monkeys and in ourselves,
and that their whole nervous system is affected in a similar way. Even the parasites, both
external and internal, that affect man are not altogether peculiar to him, but belong to the
same families or genera as those which infest animals, and in one case, scabies, even the same
species.[221] These curious facts seem quite inconsistent with the idea that man's bodily structure
and nature are altogether distinct from those of animals, and have had a different origin;
while the facts are just what we should expect if he has been produced by descent with modification
from some common ancestor.

The Animals most nearly Allied to Man.

By universal consent we see in the monkey tribe a caricature of humanity. Their faces, their
hands, their actions and expressions present ludicrous resemblances to our own. But there is
one group of this great tribe in which this resemblance is greatest, and they have hence been
called the anthropoid or man-like apes. These are few in number, and inhabit only the equatorial
regions of Africa and Asia, countries where the climate is most uniform, the forests densest,
and the supply of fruit abundant throughout the year. These animals are now comparatively well
known, consisting of the orang-utan of Borneo and Sumatra, the chimpanzee and the gorilla of
West Africa, and the group of gibbons or long-armed apes, consisting of many species and inhabiting
South-Eastern Asia and the larger Malay Islands. These last are far less like man than the
other three, one or other of which has at various times been claimed to be the most man-like
of the apes and our nearest relations in the animal kingdom. The question of the degree of
resemblance of these animals to ourselves is one of great interest, leading, as it does, to
some important conclusions as to our origin and geological antiquity, and we will therefore
briefly consider it.

If we compare the skeletons of the orang or chimpanzee with that of man, we find them to be
a kind of distorted copy, every bone corresponding (with very few exceptions), but altered
somewhat in size, proportions, and position.

The actual differences in the skeletons of these apes and that of man--that is, differences
dependent on the presence or absence of certain bones, and not on their form or position--have
been enumerated by Mr. Mivart as follows:--(1) In the breast-bone consisting of but two bones,
man agrees with the gibbons; the chimpanzee and gorilla having this part consisting of seven
bones in a single series, while in the orang they are arranged in a double series of ten bones.
(2) The normal number of the ribs in the orang and some gibbons is twelve pairs, as in man,
while in the chimpanzee and gorilla there are thirteen pairs. (3) The orang and the gibbons
also agree with man in having five lumbar vertebrae, while in the gorilla and the chimpanzee
there are but four, and sometimes only three. (4) The gorilla and chimpanzee agree with man
in having eight small bones in the wrist, while the orang and the gibbons, as well as all other
monkeys, have nine.[222]

The differences in the form, size, and attachments of the various bones, muscles, and other
organs of these apes and man are very numerous and exceedingly complex, sometimes one species,
sometimes another agreeing most nearly with ourselves, thus presenting a tangled web of affinities
which it is very difficult to unravel. Estimated by the skeleton alone, the chimpanzee and
gorilla seem nearer to man than the orang, which last is also inferior as presenting certain
aberrations in the muscles. In the form of the ear the gorilla is more human than any other
ape, while in the tongue the orang is the more man-like. In the stomach and liver the gibbons
approach nearest to man, then come the orang and chimpanzee, while the gorilla has a degraded
liver more resembling that of the lower monkeys and baboons.

The Brains of Man and Apes.

We come now to that part of his organisation in which man is so much higher than all the lower
animals--the brain; and here, Mr. Mivart informs us, the orang stands highest in rank. The
height of the orang's cerebrum in front is greater in proportion than in either the chimpanzee
or the gorilla. "On comparing the brain of man with the brains of the orang, chimpanzee, and
baboon, we find a successive decrease in the frontal lobe, and a successive and very great
increase in the relative size of the occipital lobe. Concomitantly with this increase and decrease,
certain folds of brain substance, called 'bridging convolutions,' which in man are conspicuously
interposed between the parietal and occipital lobes, seem as utterly to disappear in the chimpanzee,
as they do in the baboon. Baby. there can compare we appear we are barely the manner, the is defined

 Even some distant approach to the rudiments
of religion is said to be found in the deep love and complete submission of a dog to his master.[228]

Turning from animals to man, it is shown that in the lowest savages many of these faculties
are very little advanced from the condition in which they appear in the higher animals; while
others, although fairly well exhibited, are yet greatly inferior to the point of development
they have reached in civilised races. In particular, the moral sense is said to have been developed
from the social instincts of savages, and to depend mainly on the enduring discomfort produced
by any action which excites the general disapproval of the tribe. Thus, every act of an individual
which is believed to be contrary to the interests of the tribe, excites its unvarying disapprobation
and is held to be immoral; while every act, on the other hand, which is, as a rule, beneficial
to the tribe, is warmly and constantly approved, and is thus considered to be right or moral.
From the mental struggle, when an act that would benefit self is injurious to the tribe, there
arises conscience; and thus the social instincts are the foundation of the moral sense and
of the fundamental principles of morality.[229]

The question of the origin and nature of the moral sense and of conscience is far too vast
and complex to be discussed here, and a reference to it has been introduced only to complete
the sketch of Mr. Darwin's view of the continuity and gradual development of all human faculties
from the lower animals up to savages, and from savage up to civilised man. The point to which
I wish specially to call attention is, that to prove continuity and the progressive development
of the intellectual and moral faculties from animals to man, is not the same as proving that
these faculties have been developed by natural selection; and this last is what Mr. Darwin
has hardly attempted, although to support his theory it was absolutely essential to prove it.
Because man's physical structure has been developed from an animal form by natural selection,
it does not necessarily follow that his mental nature, even though developed pari passu with
it, has been developed by the same causes only. To illustrate by a physical analogy. Upheaval
and depression of land, combined with sub-aerial denudation by wind and frost, rain and rivers,
and marine denudation on coastlines, were long thought to account for all the modelling of
the earth's surface not directly due to volcanic action; and in the early editions of Lyell's
Principles of Geology these are the sole causes appealed to. But when the action of glaciers
was studied and the recent occurrence of a glacial epoch demonstrated as a fact, many phenomena--such
as moraines and other gravel deposits, boulder clay, erratic boulders, grooved and rounded
rocks, and Alpine lake basins--were seen to be due to this altogether distinct cause. There
was no breach of continuity, no sudden catastrophe; the cold period came on and passed away
in the most gradual manner, and its effects often passed insensibly into those produced by
denudation or upheaval; yet none the less a new agency appeared at a definite time, and new
effects were produced which, though continuous with preceding effects, were not due to the
same causes. It is not, therefore, to be assumed, without proof or against independent evidence,
that the later stages of an apparently continuous development are necessarily due to the same
causes only as the earlier stages. Applying this argument to the case of man's intellectual
and moral nature, I propose to show that certain definite portions of it could not have been
developed by variation and natural selection alone, and that, therefore, some other influence,
law, or agency is required to account for them. If this can be clearly shown for any one or
more of the special faculties of intellectual man, we shall be justified in assuming that the
same unknown cause or power may have had a much wider influence, and may have profoundly influenced
the whole course of his development.

The Origin of the Mathematical Faculty.

We have ample evidence that, in all the lower races of man, what may be termed the mathematical
faculty is, either absent, or, if present, quite unexercised. The Bushmen and the Brazilian
Wood-Indians are said not to count beyond two. Many Australian tribes only have words for one
and two, which are combined to make three, four, five, or six, beyond which they do not count.
The Damaras of South Africa only count to three; and Mr. Galton gives a curious description
of how one of them was hopelessly puzzled when he had sold two sheep for two sticks of tobacco
each, and received four sticks in payment. He could only find out that he was correctly paid
by taking two sticks and then giving one sheep, then receiving two sticks more and giving the
other sheep. Even the comparatively intellectual Zulus can only count up to ten by using the
hands and fingers. The Ahts of North-West America count in nearly the same manner, and most
of the tribes of South America are no further advanced.[230] The Kaffirs have great herds of
cattle, and if one is lost they miss it immediately, but this is not by counting, but by noticing
the absence of one they know; just as in a large family or a school a boy is missed without
going through the process of counting. He had a edition, it is unpatterned Arts, 4to, Excerpt, he

 No verbal explanation or attempt at explanation--such
as the statement that life is the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm, or that
the whole existing organic universe from the amaeba up to man was latent in the fire-mist from
which the solar system was developed--can afford any mental satisfaction, or help us in any
way to a solution of the mystery.

The third stage is, as we have seen, the existence in man of a number of his most characteristic
and noblest faculties, those which raise him furthest above the brutes and open up possibilities
of almost indefinite advancement. These faculties could not possibly have been developed by
means of the same laws which have determined the progressive development of the organic world
in general, and also of man's physical organism.[237]

These three distinct stages of progress from the inorganic world of matter and motion up to
man, point clearly to an unseen universe--to a world of spirit, to which the world of matter
is altogether subordinate. To this spiritual world we may refer the marvellously complex forces
which we know as gravitation, cohesion, chemical force, radiant force, and electricity, without
which the material universe could not exist for a moment in its present form, and perhaps not
at all, since without these forces, and perhaps others which may be termed atomic, it is doubtful
whether matter itself could have any existence. And still more surely can we refer to it those
progressive manifestations of Life in the vegetable, the animal, and man--which we may classify
as unconscious, conscious, and intellectual life,--and which probably depend upon different
degrees of spiritual influx. I have already shown that this involves no necessary infraction
of the law of continuity in physical or mental evolution; whence it follows that any difficulty
we may find in discriminating the inorganic from the organic, the lower vegetable from the
lower animal organisms, or the higher animals from the lowest types of man, has no bearing
at all upon the question. This is to be decided by showing that a change in essential nature
(due, probably, to causes of a higher order than those of the material universe) took place
at the several stages of progress which I have indicated; a change which may be none the less
real because absolutely imperceptible at its point of origin, as is the change that takes place
in the curve in which a body is moving when the application of some new force causes the curve
to be slightly altered.

Concluding Remarks.

Those who admit my interpretation of the evidence now adduced--strictly scientific evidence
in its appeal to facts which are clearly what ought not to be on the materialistic theory--will
be able to accept the spiritual nature of man, as not in any way inconsistent with the theory
of evolution, but as dependent on those fundamental laws and causes which furnish the very
materials for evolution to work with. They will also be relieved from the crushing mental burthen
imposed upon those who--maintaining that we, in common with the rest of nature, are but products
of the blind eternal forces of the universe, and believing also that the time must come when
the sun will lose his heat and all life on the earth necessarily cease--have to contemplate
a not very distant future in which all this glorious earth--which for untold millions of years
has been slowly developing forms of life and beauty to culminate at last in man--shall be as
if it had never existed; who are compelled to suppose that all the slow growths of our race
struggling towards a higher life, all the agony of martyrs, all the groans of victims, all
the evil and misery and undeserved suffering of the ages, all the struggles for freedom, all
the efforts towards justice, all the aspirations for virtue and the wellbeing of humanity,
shall absolutely vanish, and, "like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wrack behind."

As contrasted with this hopeless and soul-deadening belief, we, who accept the existence of
a spiritual world, can look upon the universe as a grand consistent whole adapted in all its
parts to the development of spiritual beings capable of indefinite life and perfectibility.
To us, the whole purpose, the only raison d'être of the world--with all its complexities of
physical structure, with its grand geological progress, the slow evolution of the vegetable
and animal kingdoms, and the ultimate appearance of man--was the development of the human spirit
in association with the human body. From the fact that the spirit of man--the man himself--is
so developed, we may well believe that this is the only, or at least the best, way for its
development; and we may even see in what is usually termed "evil" on the earth, one of the
most efficient means of its growth. For we know that the noblest faculties of man are strengthened
and perfected by struggle and effort; it is by unceasing warfare against physical evils and
in the midst of difficulty and danger that energy, courage, self-reliance, and industry have
become the common qualities of the northern races; it is by the battle with moral evil in all
its hydra-headed forms, that the still nobler qualities of justice and mercy and humanity and
self-sacrifice have been steadily increasing in the world.

We thus find that the Darwinian theory, even when carried out to its extreme logical conclusion,
not only does not oppose, but lends a decided support to, a belief in the spiritual nature
of man. It shows us how man's body may have been developed from that of a lower animal form
under the law of natural selection; but it also teaches us that we possess intellectual and
moral faculties which could not have been so developed, but must have had another origin; and
for this origin we can only find an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit.
