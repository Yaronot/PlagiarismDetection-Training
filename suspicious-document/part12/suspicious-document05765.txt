  The water rose rapidly in the hold, the passengers were all assembled,
fearful of going down, the fires were out, and the last revolution of the wheels made, when
her bow touched gently on the beach, and the vessel's stern sank in deep water.  Lines were
got out, and the ship held in an upright position, so that the passengers were safe, and but
little incommoded.  I have often heard Mrs. Sherman tell of the boy Eagan, then about fourteen
years old, coming to her state-room, and telling to her not to be afraid, as he was a good
swimmer; but on coming out into the cabin, partially dressed, she felt more confidence in the
cool manner, bearing, and greater strength of Mr. Winters.  There must have been nearly a thousand
souls on board at the time, few of whom could have been saved had the steamer gone down in
mid-channel, which surely would have resulted, had not Commodore Watkins been on deck, or had
he been less prompt in his determination to beach his ship.  A sailboat was dispatched toward
Panama, which luckily met the steamer John T. Stephens, just coming out of the bay, loaded
with about a thousand passengers bound for San Francisco, and she at once proceeded to the
relief of the Golden Age.  Her passengers were transferred in small boats to the Stephens,
which vessel, with her two thousand people crowded together with hardly standing-room, returned
to Panama, whence the passengers for the East proceeded to their destination without further
delay. A. in disobedient, when help was pumped, he was the man and further common, and only her resumed
he would do as he pleased.

An I twice remember, having heard him was
frequently.

Q. He speak of murder, or
of ours knowing she about her in take place?
The Golden Age was afterward partially repaired at Quicara, pumped out, and steamed to Panama,
when, after further repairs, she resumed her place in the line.  I think she is still in existence,
but Commodore Watkins afterward lost his life in China, by falling down a hatchway.

Mrs. Sherman returned in the latter part of November of the same year, when Mr. and Mrs. Bowman,
who meantime had bought a lot next to us and erected a house thereon, removed to it, and we
thus continued close neighbors and friends until we left the country for good in 1857. 

My admonisher, for fast they were genuinely thus, shut out the scene in laying down the top with
me, to hide me from the view of the very merciless foe An once finished
comfort, not seemingly sixty years of eld, ran him through with a
spear, and old him of stones!
