He did not stop running till he had put nearly three-quarters of a mile between him and the
school.  And then two considerations brought him to a standstill.  Firstly, he was out of breath;
he could scarcely run a step farther; and secondly, he was now close into the heart of the
village, and the groups of lounging figures he espied in the distance warned him he must be
careful how he proceeded.  About two hundred yards in advance was a public house--"The Blue
Anchor;" and here, of course, was a goodly knot of men, some inside drinking, some outside
smoking, and all making a most disreputable noise.  There were also one or two women in amongst
the crowd, evidently searching for truant sons or husbands, and Harry feared their inquisitive
eyes even more than he feared the men.  For he remembered he was covered with dust and dirt
from his scramble; his hair all rough; hatless, and generally untidy. Besides, what business
had a boy of his age and station in life to be wandering about a village, alone, at half-past nine?

So he retraced his steps a short distance, until he came to a stile leading to a lane which
skirted the village; and which, running past the farm and the church, as before-mentioned,
joined the highroad at the further end of the village.

Once in the lane, and safe from sight, he slackened his pace; and then, with the feeling of
comparative safety, came very mingled feelings of exultation, loneliness, and fear--each striving
to have the uppermost in the poor boy's heart.

Hitherto the excitement of achieving that vague performance of running away from school had
pre-occupied him, and kept away all thoughts of the future.  But the dangers of the escape
were now all overcome, or at least Harry thought they were.  What, then, was the next thing
to be done?  Should he go to Mrs Valentine?  If he went there, perhaps she would send him back
to school.  And besides, the farm would be shut up, and every one gone to bed.  How should
he attract Mrs Valentine's attention; and make her come down and let him in?  The dog was always
loose at night, to keep intruders off.  He would be sure to fly at him, if he attempted to
go near the place.

So Harry was very sore perplexed, and began to think that running away was not such an easy
thing after all.  And he remembered that Egerton was the cause of all this trouble.  Had it
not been for him, he would have been at school; motherless, it is true, but not in disgrace
as he was; sad at heart, but not hated and suspected by boys and masters. Egerton!  Egerton
had caused it all!  And Harry longed for revenge.  He would treasure up his hatred, his thirst
for vengeance, and some day, perhaps, he would meet the one who had done him this wrong, and
then the debt should be paid off.  This feeling of revenge was already firmly rooted in his
heart, already beginning to be the one purpose of his life.

He would go on towards the farm, at any rate, and see how things stood. Perhaps the dog was
not loose that night, or if it were, might recognise him.

So, plucking up his spirits, he ran along the lane towards the little farm, where he had been
so happy with his dear dead mother, and towards the quiet churchyard, whose coverlet of green
was over her.

He was not long reaching the farm, and went cautiously up to the gate. Not a sound! not a light
in any window!  There was the great silver moon making everything as bright almost as day,
and there was the slow munching of the cows in the adjoining orchard.  Harry's heart rose higher.
No dog! not a sign of him!  He put his hand to open the gate. The latch stuck.  He pushed harder;
it flew open with a sharp click, and he had not time to listen whether the sound had been heard
or no, when a dog's low growl solved the question.

He started back from the gate, which fell to with a loud crash.  It was all up now.  Out rushed
the dog, barking fiercely, and off rushed Harry simultaneously.  And naturally enough, too.
It is not pleasant to be mauled by a huge mastiff.

Had the idea struck him, he would have kept at a respectful distance, and there waited in hopes
that the baying of the dog would disturb the inmates of the house, and that on their coming
out to discover the reason, he would gain his object of being let in.

But it is very doubtful whether a much older and, therefore, more thoughtful person than Harry
would have considered anything but the fierceness of the dog, and the desirability of getting
away as quickly, and as far, as possible.

So Harry bolted down the lane at headlong speed, while the dog, seeing the intruder depart,
only uttered a few self-satisfied growls, and returned to his mat in the porch, conscious that
he had done his duty. At the same moment, Mrs Valentine opened her window and put out a night-capped
head into the moonlight, and craning it all round, to see what was the matter, and seeing nothing
extraordinary, put it in again, with a slight shiver.

Good soul! how little she dreamt of the apparently-trifling episode enacted underneath her
window!  How gladly would she have welcomed the runaway frightened boy!  And how different
that boy's after life would have been had she but wakened sooner.

Meanwhile, Harry was stopping at the churchyard-gate.  He longed to go in.  He hesitated. 
On another occasion, and in his mother's lifetime, he would not have dared to go inside the
wicket after dark.  But now, now he was going away, he knew not where!  Out into the world,
and that seemed a very long way off to Harry.  It was like another country. Besides, what would
hurt him while she was there, he asked himself?

So, without more ado, he passed through the creaking gate, up the lime-tree avenue, heedless
of the ghost-like shadows of the tombstones, and the rustle of the fragrant leaves.

It was soon found, that little grassy mound in the corner by the ivy-covered porch.  And then
he could bear up no longer.  He burst into tears, and throwing himself on the dewy moonlit
sward, wept bitterly.

"Oh, mamma, mamma, why did you die? why did you die?  What shall I do?" he sobbed in a low,
excited tone, "I'm so lonely, mamma! mamma!"

And the quiet night stole on, and the soft winds of June whispered over the motherless boy,
weeping there alone in the churchyard.

The sound of footsteps!  Harry jumped up and listened, eager, and frightened. He was not forte result

  Breakfast, too, was by no means the
usual ordinarily quiet meal.

The only boys who betrayed any symptoms of nervousness or uneasiness (all were excited, of
course) were those who had joined Egerton and Warburton in their assault on Harry the previous
night.

These looked guilty; but their ringleaders preserved the utmost coolness and indifference;
and a casual observer, if asked, would have said, "Well, if there are two boys more than any
others who certainly have nothing to do with the whole affair, those two are Egerton and Warburton."

So much for guilt, and the mask it can so well assume.

Before the nine o'clock bell had ceased ringing, every boy was in his place in the big school-room--a
rare occurrence, indeed--waiting eagerly for the appearance of the Doctor.  For boys like nothing
better than a "row" when they themselves are not implicated.  And remember, those who were
so implicated were but an exceedingly small fraction of the whole number.  What the guilty
ones felt will best be known by those who have been in a similar position.

Dr Palmer entered with the Examiner, a fresh-coloured young man, in a very new gown, and a
very new hood, thrown jauntily over his shoulders. The doctor was grave and stern, and looked
at nobody.  The Examiner played with his watch-chain, and looked at everybody, running his
eyes rapidly along the different desks and forms.  And the other masters followed in due order.
And, when all were in their respective places, prayers were said, and Dr Palmer, amid breathless
silence, spoke as follows:

"You are most of you, if not all, aware of what occurred last night. One of your number, Campbell,
has, in a fit of rashness and haste, run away, and as yet has not been found.  There must be
some special reason for this;" and the Doctor paused and looked round the room.  "I left him
in my study at half-past seven last night, having his tea, and as happy as he could be under
the sad circumstances of his mother's death."  And his voice trembled; "On reaching home a
few minutes after nine I find he has disappeared.  The dormitory, in which he slept, is discovered
in a disgraceful state of disorder and confusion.  The boys who sleep there must have an explanation
to give.  On another matter with regard to Campbell, I shall have to speak presently."  And
again the dignified voice was broken with ill-concealed emotion.  "Sit down, all of you, except
those who sleep in No. 7 dormitory."

The order was obeyed, and the sixteen stood in their places, the observed of all eyes.

"Egerton, you are eldest in the dormitory.  Did you do anything, or see anything done, that
might provoke Campbell to this rash act?"

"No, sir; nothing at all," answered Egerton, fearlessly.

"You did not interfere with him in any way?"

Egerton hesitated.  "No, sir, I didn't.  I didn't even speak to him. It wasn't likely after
what he said of me to you."

"That will do," said Doctor Palmer, in a strange tone.  "You may sit down.  Warburton!"

"Yes, sir!"

"Did you interfere with Campbell in any way last night?"

"No, sir, not at all," answered Warburton.

"Sit down!" again said the Doctor.

Two deliberate liars out of sixteen is a large proportion, and it is not to be supposed that
there would be more such.  The rest would either maintain a frightened silence or tell the
truth.  Fortunately, the boy next questioned was one of the latter class.  And his fearless
answer gave courage to the rest.

"Yes, sir, I did.  I pulled his bed out into the room and upset it," answered Williams, when
the same question was put to him.  And before the Doctor could say a word, the remaining three
implicated with Egerton, Warburton, and Williams, confessed their share in the matter. The
rest denied, with truth, having done anything to Campbell, and were told to sit down.

Those who had confessed were then called into the centre of the room and further questioned
as to who commenced the attack on Campbell, and what was the cause of it.

Williams looked at the other three who stood with him, and the three looked at Williams; and
all got very red, and said nothing.

The Doctor repeated his question.

The boys hesitated, and looked doubtfully towards Egerton and Warburton, to see if they would
come forward; but no! the two preserved the same stolid demeanour.  So at length Williams told
the whole story, not exculpating himself in the least degree, but only saying how sorry he
was; and the others confirmed his statement.

"Egerton and Warburton, stand out.  Do you hear what Williams says?  Do you still deny the
charge brought against you?"

The room was breathless.  The two culprits turned deadly pale, and began to stammer out what
was partially denial, partially excuse.  And then in an abject tone implored forgiveness.

Doctor Palmer took no notice of their entreaties, but mentioned to them to stand by his desk.
The other four he dismissed to their seats.

He then addressed the whole assemblage of boys and masters:

"I have now another matter of very serious moment to speak to you about.  A great injustice
has been done to Campbell--an injustice which has in a measure contributed, I fear, to his
reasons for running away. To set you an example of the manliness of confession, I tell you
openly, and Mr Prichard wishes me to say the same for him, that we--he and I--have made a great
mistake, and judged and punished Campbell unjustly.  You will understand that I am referring
to the book found in his possession during the examination.  At the same time, I wish you all
fully to understand that appearances went decidedly against Campbell, and evidence proved his
guilt.  And it was acting upon these appearances and this evidence that we punished him.  Mr
Franklyn, however, will kindly explain the matter to you;" and the Doctor sat down overcome
by excitement and emotion.

And then Mr Franklyn (the Examiner), after a preliminary "ahem!" spoke to the boys in a clear
ringing voice, going straight to the point without any introductory remarks.

"On Tuesday last I received the papers done by you on Monday morning. With those of the Lower
Third Form came a note from Mr Prichard, saying that he had sent with the papers a book--a
Delectus translation ('Crib' as you would call it)--which he had found in Campbell's possession
during the examination.  And he requested me, and very properly, too, to take the necessary
steps respecting Campbell's place in his class. Here, however, Mr Prichard begs me to plainly
state the mistake he made.  He did not compare the papers sent in, with the translation of
the book.  This would at once have acquitted Campbell.  For I at once emphatically say that,
even if the book were his, he never used it during the examination.  His work was correct,
but boyish in style. The rendering of the book is the work of a man.  So much, then, is clear,
that of the charge of using the book during the examination, Campbell is perfectly innocent;
and I only wish he were here to hear me say so."

At these words all reverence for masters was thrown aside, and the vehement clapping of hands
soon showed that Harry's good name was once more firmly established, and not only established,
but that his clearance gave joy to the school.

"But," resumed Mr Franklyn, when the noise had abated, "to make assurance doubly sure, I will
go a step further, and tell you who did use the book during the examination."

With a sort of presentiment of what was coming, all eyes were turned upon Egerton; while in
the hearts of many a feeling of shame--honest, good-producing shame--sprang up for the unkind
part they had played to Harry.

"On turning to Egerton's papers," continued Mr Franklyn, "I at once detected a strong similarity
to the translation I had just examined; and on a close comparison found his translation coincided
word for word with the book found in Campbell's possession, and which he was accused of using.
Whether the book belongs to Egerton or not, I do not know; but this is evident, that it was
he, and not Campbell, who was guilty of taking unfair advantage of his companions.  How the
book came into Campbell's desk I know not.  But as Egerton has been, in these two matters,
convicted of telling a wilful untruth, I am ready to believe him capable of any further deceitful
conduct to screen himself.  It rests with Doctor Palmer to conclude this most painful affair."

As Mr Franklyn ended, and resumed his seat, there was a mixed murmur, partly from pleasure
at Harry's innocence, partly from an impulse, which seemed to take possession of all, of snatching
the punishment of Egerton out of the lawful hands.

The noise, however, instantly ceased when Doctor Palmer rose.

"None of you can be more glad than I am," he said, "that Campbell's innocence has been fully
proved, and none of you more sorry than I, that he has been punished unjustly.  At the same
time, you must clearly understand that the mistake, which Mr Prichard and I made, does not
in the least degree exonerate Egerton.  He has done that for which I punished Campbell; removing
as he thought all traces of his guilt, and throwing them on another's shoulders. But the desired,
who behaved himself very seemingly speaks to the ordinary franklyn was ordered of attend him, insolently
resolved to the torture. The former, to his part opened on the device, front to be transport other
to the house, where he were pleaded not guilty.  Those who joined in bullying Campbell last night, I forgive.  They
have confessed.  Warburton has not done so.  For his lie, I punish him."

And then, calling Warburton, he caned him severely before the whole school, a punishment but
rarely adopted, and once only remembered to have taken place by the elder boys.

"With regard to Egerton," he resumed, "there is but one course for me to adopt."  And he rang
a bell which communicated with his house, and, after a breathless pause of about three minutes,
William entered, bearing a birch, with an expression of mock gravity on his countenance. Egerton's
appearance was one of abject meanness; his indifference was all gone; he was the picture of
trembling, tearful cowardice.

The birch had never been used in the recollection of any of the boys. It had only existed--a
shadowy terror.  But now that it appeared in all its stern dignity, Egerton, the destined recipient,
fell on his knees, and, with streaming eyes--coward as he was--begged imploringly for forgiveness.

It was not likely his cries would be of any avail.  Nor, indeed, were they.  Nor would the
Doctor prolong the sickening scene.  The birch did its duty, and well.
