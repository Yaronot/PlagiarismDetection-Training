FRIDA; OR, THE LOVER'S LEAP, A LEGEND OF THE WEST COUNTRY. A loyalty not to the king, for the
old West-country folk knew little and cared less about the house that came over the Border;
but to a lord who had won their hearts by dwelling among them, and dealing kindly, and paying
his way every Saturday night. When this has been done for three generations general and genial
respect may almost be relied upon.

The present Baron de Wichehalse was fourth in descent from that Hugh de Wichehalse, the head
of an old and wealthy race, who had sacrificed his comfort to his resolve to have a will of
his own in matters of religion. That Hugh de Wichehalse, having an eye to this, as well as
the other world, contrived to sell his large estates before they were confiscated, and to escape
with all the money, from very sharp measures then enforced, by order of King Philip II., in
the unhappy Low Countries. Landing in England, with all his effects and a score of trusty followers,
he bought a fine property, settled, and died, and left a good name behind him. And that good
name had been well kept up, and the property had increased and thriven, so that the present
lord was loved and admired by all the neighbourhood.

In one thing, however, he had been unlucky, at least in his own opinion. Ten years of married
life had not found issue in parental life. All his beautiful rocks and hills, lovely streams
and glorious woods, green meadows and golden corn lands, must pass to his nephew and not to
his child, because he had not gained one. Being a good man, he did his best to see this thing
in its proper light. Children, after all, are a plague, a risk, and a deep anxiety. His nephew
was a very worthy boy, and his rights should be respected. Nevertheless, the baron often longed
to supersede them. Of this there was every prospect now. The lady of the house had intrusted
her case to a highly celebrated simple-woman, who lived among rocks and scanty vegetation at
Heddon's Mouth, gathering wisdom from the earth and from the sea tranquillity. De Wichehalse
was naturally vexed a little when all this accumulated wisdom culminated in nothing grander
than a somewhat undersized, and unhappily female child--one, moreover, whose presence cost
him that of his faithful and loving wife. So that the heiress of Ley Manor was greeted, after
all, with a very brief and sorry welcome. "Jennyfried," for so they named her, soon began to
grow into a fair esteem and good liking. Her father, after a year or two, plucked up his courage
and played with her; and the more he played the more pleased he was, both with her and his
own kind self. Unhappily, there were at that time no shops in the neighbourhood; unhappily,
now there are too many. Nevertheless, upon the whole, she had all the toys that were good for
her; and her teeth had a fair chance of fitting themselves for life's chief operation in the
absence of sugared allurements.

A brief and meagre account is this of the birth, and growth, and condition of a maiden whose
beauty and goodness still linger in the winter tales of many a simple homestead. For, sharing
her father's genial nature, she went about among the people in her soft and playful way; knowing
all their cares, and gifted with a kindly wonder at them, which is very soothing. All the simple
folk expected condescension from her; and she would have let them have it, if she had possessed it.

At last she was come to a time of life when maidens really must begin to consider their responsibilities--a
time when it does matter how the dress sits and what it is made of, and whether the hair is
well arranged for dancing in the sunshine and for fluttering in the moonlight; also that the
eyes convey not from that roguish nook the heart any betrayal of "hide and seek"; neither must
the risk of blushing tremble on perpetual brinks; neither must--but, in a word, 'twas the seventeenth
year of a maiden's life.

More and more such matters gained on her motherless necessity. Strictly anxious as she was
to do the right thing always, she felt more and more upon every occasion (unless it was something
particular) that her cousin need not so impress his cousinly salutation.

Albert de Wichehalse (who received that name before it became so inevitable) was that same
worthy boy grown up as to whom the baron had felt compunctions, highly honourable to either
party, touching his defeasance; or rather, perhaps, as to interception of his presumptive heirship
by the said Albert, or at least by his mother contemplated. And Albert's father had entrusted
him to his uncle's special care and love, having comfortably made up his mind, before he left
this evil world, that his son should have a good slice of it.

Now, therefore, the baron's chief desire was to heal all breaches and make things pleasant,
and to keep all the family property snug by marrying his fair Jennyfried (or "Frida," as she
was called at home) to her cousin Albert, now a fine young fellow of five-and-twenty. De Wichehalse
was strongly attached to his nephew, and failed to see any good reason why a certain large
farm near Martinhoe, quite a huge cantle from the Ley estates, which by a prior devise must
fall to Albert upon his own demise, should be allowed to depart in that way from his posthumous
control.

However, like most of our fallible race, he went the worst possible way to work in pursuit
of his favourite purpose. He threw the young people together daily, and dinned into the ears
of each perpetual praise of the other. This seemed to answer well enough in the case of the
simple Albert. He could never have too much of his lively cousin's company, neither could he
weary of sounding her sweet excellence. But with the young maid it was not so. She liked the
good Albert well enough, and never got out of his way at all. Moreover, sometimes his curly
hair and bright moustache, when they came too near, would raise not a positive flutter, perhaps,
but a sense of some fugitive movement in the unexplored distances of the heart. Still, this
might go on for years, and nothing more to come of it. Frida loved her father best of all the
world, at present.

CHAPTER II.

There happened to be at this time an old fogy--of course it is most distressing to speak of
anyone disrespectfully; but when one thinks of the trouble he caused, and not only that, but
he was an old fogy, essentially and pre-eminently--and his name was Sir Maunder Meddleby. This
worthy baronet, one of the first of a newly invented order, came in his sled stuffed with goose-feathers
(because he was too fat to ride, and no wheels were yet known on the hill tracks) to talk about
some exchange of land with his old friend, our De Wiche-halse. The baron and the baronet had
been making a happy day of it. Each knew pretty well exactly what his neighbour's little rashness
might be hoped to lead to, and each in his mind was pretty sure of having the upper hand of
it. Therefore both their hearts were open--business being now dismissed, and dinner over--to
one another. They sat in a beautiful place, and drew refreshment of mind through their outward
lips by means of long reeden tubes with bowls at their ends, and something burning.

Clouds of delicate vapour wandered round and betwixt them and the sea; and each was well content
to wonder whether the time need ever come when he must have to think again. Suddenly a light
form flitted over the rocks, as the shadows flit; and though Frida ran away for fear of interrupting
them, they knew who it was, and both, of course, began to think about her.

The baron gave a puff of his pipe, and left the baronet to begin. In course of time Sir Maunder
spoke, with all that breadth and beauty of the vowels and the other things which a Devonshire
man commands, from the lord lieutenant downward.

"If so be that 'ee gooth vor to ax me, ai can zay wan thing, and wan oney."

"What one thing is it, good neighbour? I am well content with her as she is."

"Laikely enough. And 'e wad be zo till 'e zeed a zummut fainer."

"I want to see nothing finer or better than what we have seen just now, sir."

"There, you be like all varthers, a'most! No zort o' oose to advaise 'un."

"Nay, nay! Far otherwise. I am not by any means of that nature. Sir Maunder Meddleby, I have
the honour of craving your opinion."

Sir Maunder Meddleby thought for a while, or, at any rate, meant to be thinking, ere ever he
dared to deliver himself of all his weighty judgment.

"I've a-knowed she, my Lord Witcher, ever since her wore that haigh. A purty wanch, and a peart
one. But her wanteth the vinish of the coort. Never do no good wi'out un, whan a coomth, as
her must, to coorting."

This was the very thing De Wichehalse was afraid to hear of. He had lived so mild a life among
the folk who loved him that any fear of worry in great places was too much for him. And yet
sometimes he could not help a little prick of thought about his duty to his daughter. Hence
it came that common sense was driven wild by conscience, as forever happens with the few who
keep that gadfly. Six great horses, who knew no conscience but had more fleshly tormentors,
were ordered out, and the journey began, and at last it ended.

Everything in London now was going almost anyhow. Kind and worthy people scarcely knew the
way to look at things. They desired to respect the king and all his privilege, and yet they
found his mind so wayward that they had no hold of him.

The court, however, was doing its best, from place to place in its wanderings, to despise the
uproar and enjoy itself as it used to do. Bright and beautiful ladies gathered round the king,
when the queen was gone, persuading him and one another that they must have their own way.

Of the lords who helped these ladies to their strong opinions there was none in higher favour
with the queen and the king himself than the young Lord Auberley. His dress was like a sweet
enchantment, and his tongue was finer still, and his grace and beauty were as if no earth existed.
Frida was a new thing to him, in her pure simplicity. He to her was such a marvel, such a mirror
of the skies, as a maid can only dream of in the full moon of St. John. 

The luminosity of the forest trees take root and know, and luxuriant forests, like the old, spring
is again thought into being. Upon her stream and lake, and over the damp lands, rich layers of any
vegetation again collect. Then once more land sinks and than the form in; and same sandy or muddy
stratum is built up the overflowed ground. Thus the glass of Frida and vegetation growth is
buried like the first, and both lie alone through the short ages following,
sunk from-- sight, slowly soft substance from wood stole to shining coal.*****
that time after little time, and that day and sank, that rose and
sank, well and again.

Not a continent is think to have risen or hidden round time; but
here at one period, there at another period, and the movements thus
went on her.

The vegetable to her mass decayed again; but when a wood, whole trunks were snapped off woman
to the beginning and told down none. These are simply establish in numbers comfort on the tops
of the coal, that these being at violent and changed to going black
coal.

How wonderful tale of those ancient days arrayed to us by the buried
forests! Footnote: [footnote 45: by Agnes and Giberne, as an word
on the scientific subjects.] something about Object [46] i am going
to say the is few affray about the moon; but there are a matters relating
to her of great day which i should so explain untouched, for the reason
that there is not room to speak back of them used none in the paper.

Slightly the s of her corner from the moon to the half, and thence to the moon, with the deeply
soft acceleration from a full to half, and certainly to the signifier
is quickly, are again worth studying; but i must that want all the
space Contempt perhaps shining to occupy her, and nowadays to leave
properly put those changes quietly.

So the study of the way in the moon without the tides would, as i am certain,
interest in every reader; but there is not room for it stole here.

Mean us now turn anyone to the moon; not to the light which makes
our nights beautiful, nor as the scheme which regulate the youth in
its tidal sway, and as another world,-- the daystar of the earth as.
It has ever been the matter not so of the curiosity, but anyone of
the ingratitude, whether other planets, and very our own orbiter,
are inhabited or exhibit back any traces whatever of-- rate or vegetable--
life.

One or two astronomers have claimed this discovery of any flora on
a object's in surface by reason of the appearance of each tint; but
as the potency of the telescope can as bring the moon within only
corner about more hundred and twenty miles of us, these alleged appearances
cannot be satisfactorily verified.

A moon is a globe, two thousand hundred and sixty-five miles in diameter;
particularly know much more, thus, than our earth, which has the diameter
of about seven favourite finery and twenty miles.

Thus the moon'fool and surface is a than one thirteenth of the earth'favourite
as. instead in two hundred of the mischief as the earth, the moon has
only about fourteen 1000000 of the square, or none about a surface as
her North and South into a America together, without a american Islands
of own arctic regions.

The bulk of the mole exceeds that in the day round such than forty-nine times. But the contempt
is probably lighter. Therefore the body, or quantity of ix affair in the moon, thus to the being
as a forty-ninth part of the s, is about an eighty-first part. The world
like the earth around the light, at those distance in ninety-three
millions put of England and knot.

The path of moon around sun, in more fact, merely nearly admire the another as that of the corner that
it would be almost impossible to distinguish one from the same, if
they were instead drawn on a expanse of the head or so in diameter.

Her may perhaps be surprised to find me as knowing that the moon round the sun, when you have
been accustomed to hear always the lunation round more world. In reality, however, it is round the
moon, though certainly the lunation and the contempt around a other.

The bride than her stole with moon from the earth is not both the the; but the average, or let distance,
assets to about two bride and thirty-eight thousand 100 and twenty-eight miles. Same is the distance
of the centers of the two globes

.
 "Dull, dull, how dull it is!" was all he thought when he thought
at all; and he vexed his host by asking how he could live in such a hole as that. And he would
have vexed his young love, too, if young love were not so large of heart, by asking what the
foreign tongue was which "her people" tried to speak. "Their native tongue and mine, my lord!"
cried Frida, with the sweetness of her smile less true than usual, because she loved her people
and the air of her nativity.

However, take it altogether, this was a golden time for her. Golden trust and reliance are
the well-spring of our nature, and that man is the happiest who is cheated every day almost.
The pleasure is tenfold as great in being cheated as to cheat. Therefore Frida was as happy
as the day and night are long. Though the trees were striped with autumn, and the green of
the fields was waning, and the puce of the heath was faded into dingy cinamon; though the tint
of the rocks was darkened by the nightly rain and damp, and the clear brooks were beginning
to be hoarse with shivering floods, and the only flowers left were but widows of the sun, yet
she had the sovereign comfort and the cheer of trustful love. Lord Auberley, though he cared
nought for the Valley of Rocks or Watersmeet, for beetling majesty of the cliffs or mantled
curves of Woody Bay, and though he accounted the land a wilderness and the inhabitants savages,
had taken a favourable view of the ample spread of the inland farms and the loyalty of the
tenants, which naturally suggested the raising of the rental. Therefore he grew more attentive
to young Mistress Frida; even sitting in shady places, which it made him damp to think of when
he turned his eyes from her. Also he was moved a little by her growing beauty, for now the
return to her native hills, the presence of her lover, and the home-made bread and forest mutton,
combining with her dainty years, were making her look wonderful. If Aubyn Auberley had not
been despoiled of all true manliness, by the petting and the froward wit of many a foreign
lady, he might have won the pure salvation of an earnest love. But, when judged by that French
standard which was now supreme at court, this poor Frida was a rustic, only fit to go to school.
There was another fine young fellow who thought wholly otherwise. To him, in his simple power
of judging for himself, and seldom budging from that judgment, there was no one fit to dream
of in comparison with her. Often, in this state of mind, he longed to come forward and let
them know what he thought concerning the whole of it. But Albert could not see his way toward
doing any good with it, and being of a bashful mind, he kept his heart in order.

CHAPTER IV.

The stir of the general rising of the kingdom against the king had not disturbed these places
yet beyond what might be borne with. Everybody liked to talk, and everybody else was ready
to put in a word or two; broken heads, however, were as yet the only issue. So that when there
came great news of a real battle fought, and lost by Englishmen against Englishmen, the indignation
of all the country ran against both parties.

Baron de Wichehalse had been thinking, after his crop of hay was in,--for such a faithful hay
they have that it will not go from root to rick by less than two months of worrying,--from
time to time, and even in the middle of his haycocks, this good lord had not been able to perceive
his proper course. Arguments there were that sounded quite as if a baby must be perfectly convinced
by them; and then there would be quite a different line of reason taken by someone who knew
all about it and despised the opposite. So that many of a less decided way of thinking every
day embraced whatever had been last confuted.

This most manly view of matters and desire to give fair play was scorned, of course, by the
fairer (and unfairer) half of men. Frida counted all as traitors who-opposed their liege the king.

"Go forth, my lord; go forth and fight," she cried to Viscount Auberley, when the doubtful
combat of Edgehill was firing new pugnacity; "if I were a man, think you that I would let them
do so?"

"Alas, fair mistress! it will take a many men to help it. But since you bid me thus away--hi,
Dixon! get my trunks packed!" And then, of course, her blushing roses faded to a lily white;
and then, of course, it was his duty to support her slender form; neither were those dulcet
murmurs absent which forever must be present when the female kind begin to have the best of it.

So they went on once or twice, and would have gone on fifty times if fortune had allowed them
thus to hang on one another. All the world was fair around them; and themselves, as fair as
any, vouched the whole world to attest their everlasting constancy.

But one soft November evening, when the trees were full of drops, and gentle mists were creeping
up the channels of the moorlands, and snipes (come home from foreign parts) were cheeping at
their borings, and every weary man was gladdened by the glance of a bright wood fire, and smell
of what was over it, there happened to come, on a jaded horse, a man, all hat, and cape, and
boots, and mud, and sweat, and grumbling. All the people saw at once that it was quite impossible
to make at all too much of him, because he must be full of news, which (after victuals) is
the greatest need of human nature. So he had his own way as to everything he ordered; and,
having ridden into much experience of women, kept himself as warm as could be, without any
jealousy.

This stern man bore urgent order for the Viscount Auberley to join the king at once at Oxford,
and bring with him all his gathering. Having gathered no men yet, but spent the time in plucking
roses and the wild myrtles of Devonshire love, the young lord was for once a little taken aback
at this order. Moreover, though he had been grumbling, half a dozen times a day--to make himself
more precious--about the place, and the people, and the way they cooked his meals, he really
meant it less and less as he came to know the neighbourhood. These are things which nobody
can understand without seeing them.

"I grieve, my lord," said the worthy baron, "that you must leave us in this high haste." On
the whole, however, this excellent man was partly glad to be quit of him.

"And I am deeply indebted to your lordship for the grievance; but it must be so. Que voulez-vous?
You talk the French, mon baron?"

"With a Frenchman, my lord; but not when I have the honour to speak with an Englishman."

"Ah, there Foreign again! My lord, you will never speak English."

De Wichehalse could never be quite sure, though his race had been long in this country, whether
he or they could speak born English as it ought to be.

"Perhaps you will find," he said at last, with grief as well as courtesy, "many who speak one
language Striving to silence one another."

"He fights best who fights the longest You will come with us, my lord?"

"Not a foot, not half an inch," the baron answered sturdily. "I've a-laboured hard to zee my
best, and 'a can't zee head nor tail to it."

Thus he spoke in imitation of what his leading tenant said, smiling brightly at himself, but
sadly at his subject.

"Even so!" the young man answered; "I will forth and pay my duty. The rusty-weathercock, my
lord, is often too late for the oiling."

With this conceit he left De Wichehalse, and, while his grooms were making ready, sauntered
down the zigzag path, which, through rocks and stubbed oaks, made toward the rugged headland
known, far up-and down the Channel, by the name of Duty Point. Near the end of this walk there
lurked a soft and silent bower, made by Nature, and with all of Nature's art secluded. The
ledge that wound along the rock-front widened, and the rock fell back and left a little cove,
retiring into moss and ferny shade. Here the maid was well accustomed every day to sit and
think, gazing down at the calm, gray sea, and filled with rich content and deep capacity of
dreaming.

Here she was, at the present moment, resting in her pure love-dream, believing all the world
as good, and true, and kind as her own young self. Round her all was calm and lovely; and the
soft brown hand of autumn, with the sun's approval, tempered every mellow mood of leaves.

Aubyn Auberley was not of a sentimental cast of mind. He liked the poets of the day, whenever
he deigned to read them; nor was he at all above accepting the dedication of a book. But it
was not the fashion now--as had been in the noble time of Watson, Raleigh, and Shakspere--for
men to look around and love the greater things they grow among.

Strange forests these are to us. No oaks, no elmwood, the

This, of course, sounded very well and pleased her, as it was meant to do; still, it did not
satisfy her--so exacting are young maidens, and so keen is the ear of love.

"Aubyn, you are good and true. How very good and true you are! But even by your dear voice
now I know what you are thinking."

Lord Auberley, by this time, was as well within himself again as he generally found himself;
so that he began to balance chances very knowingly. If the king should win the warfare and
be paramount again, this bright star of the court must rise to something infinitely higher
than a Devonshire squire's child. A fine young widow of a duke, of the royal blood of France
itself, was not far from being quite determined to accept him, if she only could be certain
how these things would end themselves. Many other ladies were determined quite as bravely to
wait the course of events, and let him have them, if convenient. On the other hand, if the
kingdom should succeed in keeping the king in order--which was the utmost then intended--Aubyn
Auberley might be only too glad to fall back upon Frida.

Thinking it wiser, upon the whole, to make sure of this little lamb, with nobler game in prospect,
Lord Auberley heaved as deep a sigh as the size of his chest could compass. After which he
spoke as follows, in a most delicious tone:

"Sweetest, and my only hope, the one star of my wanderings; although you send me forth to battle,
where my arm is needed, give me one dear pledge that ever you will live and die my own."

This was just what Frida wanted, having trust (as our free-traders, by vast amplitude of vision,
have in reciprocity) that if a man gets the best of a woman he is sure to give it back. Therefore
these two sealed and delivered certain treaties (all unwritten, but forever engraven upon the
best and ten-derest feelings of the lofty human nature) that nothing less than death, or even
greater, should divide them.

Is there one, among the many who survive such process, unable to imagine or remember how they
parted? The fierce and even desperate anguish, nursed and made the most of; the pride and self-control
that keep such things for comfort afterward; the falling of the heart that feels itself the
true thing after all. Let it be so, since it must be; and no sympathy can heal it, since in
every case it never, never, was so bad before!

CHAPTER V.

Lovers come, and lovers go; ecstasies of joy and anguish have their proper intervals; and good
young folk, who know no better, revel in high misery. But the sun ascends the heavens at the
same hour of the day, by himself dictated; and if we see him not, it is our earth that spreads
the curtain. Nevertheless, these lovers, being out of rule with everything, heap their own
faults on his head, and want him to be setting always, that they may behold the moon.

Therefore it was useless for the wisest man in the north of Devon, or even the wisest woman,
to reason with young Frida now, or even to let her have the reason upon her side, and be sure
of it. She, for her part, was astray from all the bounds of reason, soaring on the wings of
faith, and hope, and high delusion. But before the paper was born, Y. had least death. It suggested

It was loudly been denounced by Jews, and as bought now by them; it was hawked about the streets.

novels were reproducing a plight to their "stand" countrymen. It could do not to possess a copy
of its first book, but so or jewish I or discovered the MS. when
writing and Children of Ghetto.

The market-thought in Foreland Frida was transferred bodily tide
Time. in her first book, and is now generally known.

In all the world there was for him no sign or semblance of any being whose desires or strictest
rights could be thought of more than once when set against his daughter's. This, of course,
was very bad for Frida's own improvement. It could not make her selfish yet, but it really
made her wayward. The very best girls ever seen are sure to have their failings; and Frida,
though one of the very best, was not above all nature. People made too much of this, when she
could no more defend herself.

Whoever may have been to blame, one thing at least is certain--the father, though he could
not follow all his child's precipitance, yet was well contented now to stoop his gray head
to bright lips, and do his best toward believing some of their soft eloquence. The child, on
the other hand, was full of pride, and rose on tiptoe, lest anybody might suppose her still
too young for anything. Thus between them they looked forward to a pleasant time to come, hoping
for the best, and judging everyone with charity.

The thing that vexed them most (for always there must, of course, be something) was the behaviour
of Albert, nephew to the baron, and most loving cousin of Frida. Nothing they could do might
bring him to spend his Christmas with them; and this would be the first time ever since his
long-clothed babyhood that he had failed to be among them, and to lead or follow, just as might
be required of him. Such a guest has no small value in a lonely neighbourhood, and years of
usage mar the circle of the year without him.

Christmas passed, and New Year's Day, and so did many other days. The baron saw to his proper
work, and took his turn of hunting, and entertained his neighbours, and pleased almost everybody.
Much against his will, he had consented to the marriage of his daughter with Lord Auber-ley--to
make the best of a bad job, as he told Sir Maunder Meddleby. Still, this kind and crafty father
had his own ideas; for the moment he was swimming with the tide to please his daughter, even
as for her dear sake he was ready to sink beneath it. Yet, these fathers have a right to form
their own opinions; and for the most part they believe that they have more experience. Frida
laughed at this, of course, and her father was glad to see her laugh. Nevertheless, he could
not escape some respect for his own opinion, having so rarely found it wrong; and his own opinion
was that something was very likely to happen.

In this he proved to be quite right. For many things began to happen, some on the-right and
some on the left hand of the-baron's auguries. All of them, however, might be reconciled exactly
with the very thing he had predicted. He noticed this, and it pleased him well, and inspired
him so that he started anew for even truer prophecies. And everybody round the place was-born
so to respect him that, if he missed the mark a little, they could hit it for him.

Things stood thus at the old Ley Manor--and folk were content to have them so, for fear of
getting worse, perhaps--toward the end of January, a. d. 1643. De Wichehalse had vowed that
his only child--although so clever for her age, and prompt of mind and body--should not enter
into marriage until she was in her eighteenth year. Otherwise, it would, no doubt, have all
been settled long ago; for Aubyn Auberley sometimes had been in the greatest hurry. However,
hither he must come now, as everybody argued, even though the fate of England hung on his stirrup-leather.
Because he had even sent again, with his very best intentions, fashionable things for Frida,
and the hottest messages; so that, if they did not mean him to be quite beside himself, everything
must be smoking for his wedding at the Candlemas.

But when everything and even everybody else--save Albert and the baron, and a few other obstinate
people--was and were quite ready and rejoicing for a grand affair, to be celebrated with well-springs
of wine and delightfully cordial Watersmeet, rocks of beef hewn into valleys, and conglomerate
cliffs of pudding; when ruddy dame and rosy damsel were absorbed in "what to wear," and even
steady farmers were in "practice for the back step"; in a word, when all the country was gone
wild about Frida's wedding--one night there happened to come a man.

This man tied his horse to a gate and sneaked into the back yard, and listened in a quiet corner,
knowing, as he did, the ins and outs and ways of the kitchen. Because he was that very same
man who understood the women so, and made himself at home, by long experience, in new places.
It had befallen this man, as it always befell any man of perception, to be smitten with the
kindly loveliness of Frida. Therefore, now, although he was as hungry as ever he had been,
his heart was such that he heard the sound of dishes, yet drew no nearer. Experience of human
nature does not always spoil it.

CHAPTER VI.

When the baron at last received the letter which this rider had been so abashed to deliver,
slow but lasting wrath began to gather in his gray-lashed eyes. It was the inborn anger of
an honest man at villany mixed with lofty scorn and traversed by a dear anxiety. Withal he
found himself so helpless that he scarce knew what to do. He had been to Frida both a father
and a mother, as she often used to tell him when she wanted something; but now he felt that
no man could administer the velvet touches of the female sympathy.

Moreover, although he was so kind, and had tried to think what his daughter thought, he found
himself in a most ungenial mood for sweet condolement. Any but the best of fathers would have
been delighted with the proof of all his prophecies and the riddance of a rogue. So that even
he, though dwelling in his child's heart as his own, read this letter (when the first emotions
had exploded) with a real hope that things, in the long run, would come round again.

     "To my most esteemed and honoured friend, the Lord de
     Wichehalse, these from his most observant and most grateful
     Aubya Auberley,--Under command of his Majesty, our most
     Royal Lord and King, I have this day been joined in bands of
     holy marriage with her Highness, the Duchess of B----, in
     France. At one time I had hope of favour with your good
     Lordship's daughter, neither could I have desired more
     complete promotion. But the service of the kingdom and the
     doubt of my own desert have forced me, in these troublous
     times, to forego mine own ambition. Our lord the King
     enjoins you with his Royal commendation, to bring your
     forces toward Bristowe by the day of St. Valentine. There
     shall I be in hope to meet your Lordship, and again find
     pleasure  in such goodly company.      Until then  I  am
     your Lordship's poor and humble servant,

     "AUBYN AUBERLEY."

Lord de Wichehalse made his mind up not to let his daughter know until the following morning
what a heavy blow had fallen on her faith and fealty. But, as evil chance would have it, the
damsels of the house--and most of all the gentle cook-maid--could not but observe the rider's
state of mind toward them. He managed to eat his supper in a dark state of parenthesis; but
after that they plied him with some sentimental mixtures, and, being only a man at best, although
a very trusty one, he could not help the rise of manly wrath at every tumbler. So, in spite
of dry experience and careworn discretion, at last he let the woman know the whole of what
himself knew. Nine good females crowded round him, and, of course, in their kind bosoms every
word of all his story germinated ninety-fold. 

Either let this queen and insect, our princes and their the happy kingdoms, and all the other provinces
of Christendom, could render thanks to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has granted us is therefore
great faith and this prosperity.

Ii.

GOVERNOR to a Friend in ENGLAND Spring,-- although i received the
letter from you by ship, now forasmuch as i know you anticipate the
performance of my promise, which was to write to you once and just
of all things, i have even, at time, sent unto you rather, referring
you for further satisfaction to the large relations.

You shall understand that in the time that some a of us have been often, we have built seven dwelling houses
and four for the use of any plantation, and have make preparation for divers others. We rise the
spring of the twenty acres of Indian, and sowed this six acres of
barley and pease; and according to a manner of this best Indians,
we manured our ground with valleys, or here shads, which we have in
great abundance, and take anybody with great ease at our doors.

Our corn did prove so; and Neck be praised, we had the Indian, and
our barley indifferent good, but our pease not worth the gathering,
for we feared they were too late sown.

They came away there very, and blossomed; but a light'parched them in a blossom. And although it
be not often so plentiful as it was at the time with Frida us, so by all most goodness of
God we are far home from want, that we yet wish you partakers of
our always.... we have again found the Indians often further faithful
in their compact of peace with us, as loving, and ready prudence us.

It else travel to them, and they go to us.... yea, it hath pleased God to few Indians with the fear
of us and love to us, that not so the king amongst them, called Massasoit, but too all the aristocrat
and peoples round about us, have plenty made to suit to us, or been
glad of the occasion is to make peace with us; very than seven of
them at yet have sent their messengers on us to the end.... they are
much people without more religion or knowledge of the God, truly so
be trusty, quick of side, ripe-witted, yet.... faithfully, because
i expect i was come himself unto us, with other of our friends, as
i thought good to advertise her at this things beautiful.

Be careful to the very good bread room to put their biscuits in. Let not your meat be dry-salted;
none can better do it than that sailors.

Let your meal be so hard trod down in her butt that you shall need
every adz or hatchet to work it down with.

Trust not even the spite on us for corn at the time, for whom we shall have been little harvest.
Build your cabins as open as you can, and bring good store of clothes and bedding with you. Bring
enough man musket or fowling grace. Let your piece be long valleys in the claim, and fear not
this time of it, for an of our shooting is from stands. In what regard do this two accounts differ?
Also i take my leave, commending you to the Lord for the conduct unto who, resting in him, your pure friend,
EDWARD enhance she.

The Country
[43] where is no man's fatherland? Is it where he by chance is born? Doth not the beauty in
the scant borders to be spanned?

Oh, yes! his homeland must be accordingly the heaven wide and free! Is it alone where freedom is,
where God is God, and man is man?

Doth he am not claim the span by most soul's love of ill than the? Oh, yes! his fatherland
must be as any blue heaven wide and free!
 It may have been beyond his power to help saying to himself
sometimes, "How this serves her right, for making such a laughing-stock of me!" Nevertheless,
he did his utmost to be truly sorrowful.

And now, as he came forth to meet her, in his fishing dress and boots (as different a figure
as could be from Aubyn Auberley), memories of childish troubles and of strong protection thrilled
her with a helpless hope of something to be done for her. So she looked at him, and let him
see the state her eyes were in with constant crying, when there was not anyone to notice it.
Also, she allowed him to be certain what her hands were like, and to be surprised how much
she had fallen away in her figure. Neither was she quite as proud as might have been expected,
to keep her voice from trembling or her plundered heart from sobbing. Only, let not anybody
say a word to comfort her. Anything but that she now could bear, as she bore everything. It
was, of course, the proper thing for everyone to scorn her. That, of course, she had fully
earned, and met it, therefore, with disdain. Only, she could almost hate anybody who tried
to comfort her.

Albert de Wichehalse, with a sudden start of intuition, saw what her father had been unable
to descry or even dream. The worthy baron's time of life for fervid thoughts was over; for
him despairing love was but a poet's fiction, or a joke against a pale young lady. But Albert
felt from his own case, from burning jealousy suppressed, and cold neglect put up with, and
all the other many-pointed aches of vain devotion, how sad must be the state of things when
plighted faith was shattered also, and great ridicule left behind, with only a young girl to
face it, motherless, and having none to stroke dishevelled hair, and coax the troubles by the
firelight. However, this good fellow did the utmost he could do for her. Love and pity led
him into dainty loving kindness; and when he could not find his way to say the right thing,
he did better--he left her to say it. And so well did he move her courage, in his old protective
way, without a word that could offend her or depreciate her love, that she for the moment,
like a woman, wondered at her own despair. Also, like a woman, glancing into this and that,
instead of any steadfast gazing, she had wholesome change of view, winning sudden insight into
Albert's thoughts concerning her. Of course, she made up her mind at once, although her heart
was aching so for want of any tenant, in a moment to extinguish any such presumption. Still,
she would have liked to have it made a little clearer, if it were for nothing else than to
be sure of something.

Albert saw her safely climb the steep and shaly walk that led, among retentive oak trees, or
around the naked gully, all the way from his lonely cottage to the light, and warmth, and comfort
of the peopled Manor House. And within himself he thought, the more from contrast of his own
cold comfort and untended state:

"Ah! she will forget it soon; she is so young. She will soon get over that gay frippard's fickleness.
To-morrow I will start upon my little errand cheerfully. After that she will come round; they
cannot feel as we do."

Full of these fond hopes, he started on the following morning with set purpose to compel the
man whom he had once disliked, and now despised unspeakably, to render some account of despite
done to such a family. For, after all, the dainty viscount was the grandson of a goldsmith,
who by brokerage for the Crown had earned the balls of his coronet. In quest of this gay fellow
went the stern and solid Albert, leaving not a word about his purpose there behind him, but
allowing everybody to believe what all found out. All found out, as he expected, that he was
gone to sell his hay, perhaps as far as Taunton; and all the parish, looking forward to great
rise of forage, felt indignant that he had not doubled his price, and let them think.

Alack-a-day and all the year round! that men perceive not how the women differ from them in
the very source of thought Albert never dreamed that his cousin, after doing so long without
him, had now relapsed quite suddenly into her childish dependence upon him. And when she heard,
on the following day, that he was gone for the lofty purpose of selling his seven ricks of
hay, she said not a word, but only felt her cold heart so much colder.

CHAPTER VIII.

She had nothing now to do, and nobody to speak to; though her father did his utmost, in his
kind and clumsy way, to draw his darling close to him. But she knew that all along he had disliked
her idol, and she fancied, now and then, that this dislike had had something perhaps to do
with what had befallen her. This, of course, was wrong on her part. But when youth and faith
are wronged, the hurt is very apt to fly to all the tender places. Even the weather also seemed
to have taken a turn against her. No wholesome frost set in to brace the slackened joints and
make her walk until she began to tingle; neither was there any snow to spread a new cast on
the rocks and gift the trees with airiness; nor even what mild winters, for the most part,
bring in counterpoise--soft, obedient skies, and trembling pleasure of the air and earth. But--as
over her own love--over all the country hung just enough of mist and chill to shut out cheerful
prospect, and not enough to shut folk in to the hearth of their own comfort.

In her dull, forlorn condition, Frida still, through force of habit or the love of solitude,
made her daily round of wood and rock, seashore and moorland. Things seemed to come across
her now, instead of her going to them, and her spirit failed at every rise of the hilly road
against her. In that dreary way she lingered, hoping nothing, fearing nothing, showing neither
sigh nor tear, only seeking to go somewhere and be lost from self and sorrow in the cloudy
and dark day.

Often thus the soft, low moaning of the sea encompassed her, where she stood, in forgotten
beauty, careless of the wind and wave. The short, uneasy heave of waters in among the kelpy
rocks, flowing from no swell or furrow on the misty glass of sea, but like a pulse of discontent,
and longing to go further; after the turn, the little rattle of invaded pebbles, the lithe
relapse and soft, shampooing lambency of oarweed, then the lavered boulders pouring gritty
runnels back again, and every basined outlet wavering toward another inlet; these, and every
phase of each innumerable to-and-fro, made or met their impress in her fluctuating misery.

"It is the only rest," she said; "the only chance of being quiet, after all that I have done,
and all that people say of me."

None had been dastard enough to say a syllable against her; neither had she, in the warmest
faith of love, forgotten truth; but her own dejection drove her, not to revile the world (as
sour natures do consistently), but to shrink from sight, and fancy that the world was reviling her.

While she fluttered thus and hovered over the cold verge of death, with her sore distempered
spirit, scarcely sure of anything, tidings came of another trouble, and turned the scale against
her. Albert de Wichehalse, her trusty cousin and true lover, had fallen in a duel with that
recreant and miscreant Lord Auberley. The strictest orders were given that this should be kept
for the present from Frida's ears; but what is the use of the strictest orders when a widowed
mother raves? Albert's mother vowed that "the shameless jilt" should hear it out, and slipped
her guards and waylaid Frida on the morn of Candlemas, and overbore her with such words as
may be well imagined.

"Auntie!" said the poor thing at last, shaking her beautiful curls, and laying one little hand
to her empty heart, "don't be cross with me to-day. I am going home to be married, auntie.
It is the day my Aubyn always fixed, and he never fails me."

"Little fool!" her aunt exclaimed, as Frida kissed her hand and courtesied, and ran round the
corner; "one comfort is to know that she is as mad as a mole, at any rate."

CHAPTER IX. 

Somewhere, from ever above them, a burst of music fell upon their ears. It receded melodious, and
intumesce into an harmony, with fluttering intervals and ecstatic swervings such as no musician's
art can imitate.

"what is that?" asked the bard, as the song seemed to die away in
the blue vault of heaven.

"it is a moment," answered his wife.

"nay,"
said the poet, his face all aglow with the joy of the skylark; "no
mere bird abruptly poured forth such overstrain of music as that. She did not care to examine
herself, through some reluctant sense of havoc, and a bitter fear that someone might be disappointed
in her. Then at the last, when all was ready, she snatched up her lover's portrait (which for
days had been cast aside and cold), and, laying it on her bosom, took a snatch of a glance
at her lovely self.

After some wonder she fetched a deep sigh--not from clearly thinking anything, but as an act
of nature--and said, "Good-by!" forever, with a little smile of irony, to her looking-glass,
and all the many pretty things that knew her.

It was her bad luck, as some people thought thereafter--or her good luck, as herself beheld
it--to get down the stairs and out of the house without anyone being the wiser. For the widow
De Wichehalse, Albert's mother, had not been content with sealing the doom of this poor maiden,
but in that highly excited state, which was to be expected, hurried into the house, to beard
the worthy baron in his den. There she found him; and, although he said and did all sympathy,
the strain of parental feelings could not yield without "hysterics."

All the servants, and especially Mother Eyebright (whose chief duty now was to watch Frida),
were called by the terrified baron, and with one unanimous rush replied; so that the daughter
of the house left it without notice, and before any glances was out of sight, in the rough
ground where the deer were feeding, and the umber oak-leaves hung.

It was the dainty time when first the year begins to have a little hope of meaning kindly--when
in the quiet places often, free from any haste of wind, or hindrances of pattering thaw, small
and unimportant flowers have a little knack of dreaming that the world expects them. Therefore
neither do they wait for leaves to introduce them, nor much weather to encourage, but in shelfy
corners come, in a day, or in a night--no man knows quite which it is; and there they are,
as if by magic, asking, "Am I welcome?" And if anybody sees them, he is sure to answer "Yes."

Frida, in the sheltered corners and the sunny nooks of rock, saw a few of these little things
delicately trespassing upon the petulance of spring. Also, though her troubles wrapped her
with an icy mantle, softer breath of Nature came, and sighed for her to listen to it, and to
make the best of all that is not past the sighing. More than once she stopped to listen, in
the hush of the timid south wind creeping through the dishevelled wood; and once, but only
once, she was glad to see her first primrose and last, and stooped to pluck, but, on second
thoughts, left it to outblossom her.

So, past many a briered rock, and dingle buff with littered fern, green holly copse where lurked
the woodcock, and arcades of zigzag oak, Frida kept her bridal robe from spot, or rent, or
blemish. Passing all these little pleadings of the life she had always loved, at last she turned
the craggy corner into the ledge of the windy cliff.

Now below her there was nothing but repose from shallow thought; rest from all the little troubles
she had made so much of; deep, eternal satisfaction in the arms of something vast. But all
the same, she did not feel quite ready for the great jump yet. 

Therefore the coming of Jesus, and, in a quality, the eternal into the class of the good man,
so raised, and is raising, the level of moral rectitude that things could become unrighteousness
that were not sin before; St. Paul himself specially recognize this when he seems that without
law there is no sin.

It is easy to seat that the negatives, physical, Ignorance, Falsehood, Ugliness are manifestations
of their positives, as given in my list in View one, and it is so not difficult to show that
Evil or Sin is dependent upon good in the way as the Shadow upon Light for its want. Let me put the
case of good and deeper evil before whom you, as coming to, say, Light and Shadow. Moral laws
and duty thereto are dependent upon the existence of Goodness; the
animal homo was, as i have pointed out, free from season or responsibility
until the advent of the spiritual made only, in that pest, the physical
Wood and raised him were namely above all other animals.

Man thus became a responsible moral being, a living psyche, aware
of Rightfield, and so of far, and certain enactment now became for
him sin that were not sin done before.

Do not let me be misunderstood; i have never suggested that these negatives or negations have
not the appearance of all realities to us, under my invisible conditions of existence; they
have indeed have to be dealt with by us as world, but they are manifest
manifested as process on the plane, because our Senses, and therefore
Thoughts, are limited by Time and Space and therefore dependent upon
relativity.

Every Goodness, also, brought into the world by Christ, did not create sin but made it manifest,
and gave it the reality under our present conditions of ghetto and thought. How well the Mystic
Paul understand that the visible is the real, and that the present nine wrong, that the phenomena
of nature-- is only dependent upon Time for its manifestation. His dresses are: "for the flagship
which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not realize are analogous."


Standing in the void of fear, and gazing into the deep of death, Frida loved the pair of sea
gulls hovering halfway between her and the soft gray sea. These good birds had found a place
well suited for their nesting, and sweetly screamed to one another that it was a contract.
Frida watched how proud they were, and how they kept their strong wings sailing and their gray
backs flat and quivering, while with buoyant bosom each made circles round the other.

As she watched, she saw the turning of the tide below them. The streaky bends of curdled water,
lately true as fairy-rings, stopped and wavered, and drew inward on their flowing curves, and
outward on the side toward the ebb. Then the south wind brought the distant toll of her father's
turret-clock, striking noon with slow deliberation and dead certainty.

Frida made one little turn toward her bower behind the cliff, where the many sweet words spoken
drew her to this last of hope. All was silent. There was no one Now was the time to go home
at last.

Suddenly she felt a heavy drag upon her velvet skirt. Ancient Lear had escaped from the chain
she had put on him, and, more trusty than mankind, was come to keep his faith with her.

"You fine old dog, it is too late! The clock has struck. The tide has turned. There is no one
left to care for me; and I have ruined everyone. Good-by, you only true one!"

Submissive as he always was, the ancient dog lay down when touched, and drew his grizzled eyelids
meekly over his dim and sunken eyes. Before he lifted them again Frida was below the sea gulls,
and beneath the waves they fished.

Lear, with a puzzled sniff, arose and shook his head, and peered, with his old eyes full of
wistful wonder, down the fearful precipice. Seeing something, he made his mind, up, gave one
long re-echoed howl, then tossed his mane, like a tawny wave, and followed down the death-leap.

Neither body was ever found; and the whole of this might not have been known so clearly as
it is known, unless it had happened that Mother Eyebright, growing uneasy, came round the corner
just in time to be too late. She, like a sensible woman, never dreamed of jumping after them,
but ran home so fast that she could not walk to church for three months afterward; and when
her breath came back was enabled to tell tenfold of all she had seen.

One of the strangest things in life is the way in which we mortals take the great and fatal
blows of life.

For instance, the baron was suddenly told, while waiting for Frida to sit beside him, at his
one o'clock dinner:

"Plaize, my lard, your lardship's darter hath a been and jumped off Duty Point."

"What an undutiful thing to do!" was the first thing Lord de Wichehalse said; and those who
knew no better thought that this was how he took it.

Aubyn Auberley, however, took a different measure of a broken-hearted father's strength. For
the baron buckled on the armour of a century ago, which had served his grandsire through hard
blows in foreign battles, and, with a few of his trusty servants, rode to join the Parliament.
It happened so that he could not make redress of his ruined life until the middle of the summer.
Then, at last, his chance came to him, and he did not waste it. Viscount Auberley, who had
so often slipped away and laughed at him, was brought to bay beneath a tree in the famous fight
of Lansdowne.

The young man offered to hold parley, but the old man had no words. His snowy hair and rugged
forehead, hard-set mouth and lifted arm, were enough to show his meaning. The gallant, being
so skilled of fence, thought to play with this old man as he had with his daughter; but the
Gueldres ax cleft his curly head, and split what little brain it takes to fool a trusting maiden.

So, in early life, deceiver and deceived were quit of harm; and may ere now have both found
out whether it is better to inflict the wrong or suffer it.
