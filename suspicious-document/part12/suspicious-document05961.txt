A STUDY OF SHAKESPEARE BY ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE.

PREFACE TO THIS EDITION

Begun in the winter of 1874, a first instalment of "A Study of Shakespeare" appeared in the
Fortnightly Review for May 1875, and a second in the number for June 1876, but the completed
work was not issued in book form until June 1880.  In a letter to me (January 31, 1875), Swinburne
said:

   "I am now at work on my long-designed essay or study on the metrical
   progress or development of Shakespeare, as traceable by ear and not
   by finger, and the general changes of tone and stages of mind
   expressed or involved in this change or progress of style."

The book was produced at the moment when controversy with regard to the internal evidence of
composition in the writings attributed to Shakespeare was raging high, and the amusing appendices
were added at the last moment that they might infuriate the pedants of the New Shakespeare
Society.  They amply fulfilled that amiable purpose.

With my word, i am in passion into the South.

  For two hundred years at least have students of every
kind put forth in every sort of boat on a longer or a shorter voyage of research across the
waters of that unsounded sea.  From the paltriest fishing-craft to such majestic galleys as
were steered by Coleridge and by Goethe, each division of the fleet has done or has essayed
its turn of work; some busied in dredging alongshore, some taking surveys of this or that gulf
or headland, some putting forth through shine and shadow into the darkness of the great deep.
Nor does it seem as if there would sooner be an end to men's labour on this than on the other
sea.  But here a difference is perceptible.  The material ocean has been so far mastered by
the wisdom and the heroism of man that we may look for a time to come when the mystery shall
be manifest of its furthest north and south, and men resolve the secret of the uttermost parts
of the sea: the poles also may find their Columbus.  But the limits of that other ocean, the
laws of its tides, the motive of its forces, the mystery of its unity and the secret of its
change, no seafarer of us all may ever think thoroughly to know.  No wind-gauge will help us
to the science of its storms, no lead- line sound for us the depth of its divine and terrible
serenity.
