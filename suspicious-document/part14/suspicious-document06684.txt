"Rest here!" she said. "Let a good word close the subject! Gilbert, take your father out and
show him your farm. Mother, it is near dinner-time; I will help you set the table. After dinner,
Mr. Barton, you and I will ride home together."

Her words were obeyed; each one felt that no more should be said at that time. His element he had

to the nuptials, and took the necessary steps, in advance, for the transfer of his daughter's
fortune into her own hands. In short, as Miss Lavender observed, there was an end of snarls.
The lives of the lovers were taken up, as by a skilful hand, and evenly reeled together.

Gilbert now might have satisfied his ambition (and the people, under the peculiar circumstances
of the case, would have sanctioned it) by buying the finest farm in the neighborhood; but Martha
had said,--

"No other farm can be so much yours, and none so welcome a home to me. In cross-reference will

Dr. Deane had set up a "chair," which was to be used for the first time on this occasion. It

bland, smiling, a figure of sober gloss and agreeable odors. He led Mary Barton by the hand;
and her steel-colored silk and white crape shawl so well harmonized with his appearance, that
the two might have been taken for man and wife. Her face was calm, serene, and full of quiet
gratitude. They took their places in the chair, the lines were handed to the Doctor, and he
drove away, nodding right and left to the crowd.
