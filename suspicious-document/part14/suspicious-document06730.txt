"'Is Mrs. Reed with you? If she is, tell her Mr. Reed is here!' There before us stood father!
At the sight, mother, weak with joy, fell on her knees with outstretched arms, while I tried
to run to meet him, but found myself too much exhausted, so I just held out my arms, too, and
waited! In a moment he was where we could touch him and know that he was flesh and blood and
not just a beautiful dream. He had planned to meet us just where we were, and had brought with
him fourteen men and a generous supply of bread.

"As he knelt and clasped mother in his arms she told him that Patty and Tommy were still at
the lake, and with a horrified exclamation, he started to his feet. 'I must go for them at
once,' he said. 'There is no time to lose.' With one long embrace off he went as if on winged
feet, traveling the distance which had taken us five days to go in two, we afterward heard.
He found the children alive, to his great joy, but, oh, what a sight met his gaze! The famished
little children and the death-like look of all at the lake made his heart ache. He filled Patty's
apron with biscuits, which she carried around, giving one to each person. He also had soup
made for the infirm, and rendered every possible assistance to the sufferers, then, leaving
them with provisions for seven days, he started off, taking with him seventeen who were able
to travel, and leaving at the lake three of his men to aid those who were too weak to walk.

"Almost as soon as father's party started out, they were caught in a terrible snow-storm and
hurricane, and his description of the scene later was heart-breaking, as he told about the
crying of the half-frozen children, the lamenting of the mothers and suffering of the whole
party, while above all could be heard the shrieking of the storm king. One who has never seen
a blizzard in the Sierras can have no idea of the situation, but we knew. All night father
and his men worked in the raging storm, trying to put up shelters for the dying women and children,
while at times the hurricane would burst forth with such fury that he felt frightened on account
of the tall timber surrounding the camp. The party was almost without food, having left so
much with the sufferers at the lake. Father had cached provisions on his way to the lake, and
had sent three men forward to get it before the storm set in, but they could not get back.
At one time the fire was nearly gone; had it been lost, all would have perished. For three
days and three nights they were exposed to the fury of that terrible storm; then father became
snow-blind, and would have died if two of his faithful comrades had not worked over him all
night, but from that time all responsibility of the relief work was taken from him, as he was
physically unfit.

"At last the storm abated, and the party halted, while father with Mr. McCutchen and Mr. Miller
went on ahead to send back aid for those who were exhausted from the terrible journeying. Hiram
Miller carried Tommy, while Patty started bravely to walk, but soon she sank on the snow and
seemed to be dying. All gathered around in frantic efforts to revive the child, and luckily
father found some crumbs in the thumb of his woolen mitten which he warmed and moistened between
his own lips, and fed Patty. Slowly she came to life again, and was carried along by different
ones in the company, so that by the time the party reached Woodworth's Camp she was quite herself
again, and as she sat cozily before a big camp-fire she fondled and talked to a tiny doll which
had traveled with her all the way from Springfield and which was her chosen confidante.

"As soon as father's party reached Woodworth's Camp a third relief party started back to help
those who were slowly following, and still another party went on to Donner Lake to the relief
of those who were still living. But many of that emigrant band lie sleeping to-day on the shore
of that quiet mountain lake, for out of the eighty-three persons who were snowed in there,
forty-two died, and of the thirty-one emigrants who left Springfield on that lovely April morning
of 1846, only eighteen lived to reach California. Among them were our family, who, despite
the terrible hardships and hideous privations we had suffered, yet seemed to have been especially
watched over by a kind Providence, for we all lived to reach our goal, and were the only family
who were not obliged at some part of the journey to subsist on human flesh to keep from perishing.
God was good to our family, and I, Virginia, testify to the heroic qualities which were developed
in even the youngest of us, and for my own part, I gratefully recognize the blessings which
came to me from an unqualified faith in God and an unfaltering trust that He would take care
of us--which He did.

"Mother, Jimmy and I reached California and were taken at once to the home of the mayor, Mr.
Sinclair, where we were given a warm welcome and where nothing was left undone for our comfort.
But we were still too anxious to be happy, for we knew that father's party had been caught
in the storm." Virginia says: "I can see mother now as she stood leaning against the door for
hours at a time, looking at the mountains. At last--oh wonderful day--they came, father, Patty
and Tommy! In the moment of blissful reunion tears and smiles intermingled and all the bitterness
and losses and sorrows of the cruel journey were washed away, leaving only a tender memory
of those noble souls who had fared forth, not to the land of their dreams, but to a far country
whose maker and builder is God.

"And for us, it was spring in California!"

LOUISA M. ALCOTT: AUTHOR OF "LITTLE WOMEN"

In a pleasant, shady garden in Concord, Massachusetts, under a gnarled old apple-tree, sat
a very studious looking little person, bending over a sheet of paper on which she was writing.
She had made a seat out of a tree stump, and a table by laying a board across two carpenter's
horses, whose owner was working in the house, and no scholar writing a treatise on some deep
subject could have been more absorbed in his work than was the little girl in the garden.

For a whole long hour she wrote, frequently stopping to look off into the distance and bite
the end of her pencil with a very learned look, then she would bend over her paper again and
write hard and fast. Finally, she laid down her pencil with an air of triumph, jumped up from
the stump and rushed toward the house.

"Mother! Anna! I've written a poem about the robin we found this morning in the garden!" "this, to cohort

 The unhappy ending to that incident is very tersely
told by Louisa, who says: "My fun ended the next day, when I was tied to the arm of the sofa
to repent at leisure!"

That the six years spent in Boston were happy ones, and that the budding spirit of Louisa was
filled with joy at merely being alive, was shown one morning, when, at the breakfast table,
she suddenly looked up with an all-embrasive smile and exclaimed:

"I love everybody in dis whole world!"

Despite the merriment which was always a feature of the Alcott home, as they were all blessed
with a sense of humor which helped them over many a hard place, there was an underlying anxiety
for Mr. and Mrs. Alcott, as the school was gradually growing smaller and there was barely enough
income to support their family, to which a third daughter, Elizabeth, the "Beth" of Little
Women, had been added recently. During those days they lived on very simple fare, which the
children disliked, as their rice had to be eaten without sugar and their mush without butter
or molasses. Nor did Mr. Alcott allow meat on his table, as he thought it wrong to eat any
creature which had to be killed for the purpose. An old family friend who lived at a Boston
hotel sympathized strongly with the children's longing for sweets, and every day at dinner
she saved them a piece of pie or cake, which Louisa would call for, carrying a bandbox for
the purpose. The friend was in Europe for years, and when she returned Louisa Alcott had become
famous. Meeting her on the street one day, Louisa greeted her old friend, eagerly:

"Why, I did not think you would remember me!" said the old lady.

"Do you suppose I shall ever forget that bandbox!" was the quick reply.

As time went on, Mr. Alcott's school dwindled until he had only five scholars, and three of
them were his own children. Something new had to be tried, and quickly, so the family moved
out of the city, into a small house at Concord, Mass., which had an orchard and a garden, and,
best of all, the children had a big barn, where they gave all sorts of entertainments; mostly
plays, as they were born actors. Their mother, or "Marmee," as the girls called her, loved
the fun as well as they did, and would lay aside her work at any moment to make impossible
costumes for fairies, gnomes, kings or peasants, who were to take the principal parts in some
stirring melodrama written by the girls themselves, or some adaptation of an old fairy tale.
They acted Jack the Giant-killer in fine style, and the giant came tumbling headlong from a
loft when Jack cut down the squash-vine running up a ladder and supposed to represent the immortal
beanstalk. At other performances Cinderella rolled away in an impressive pumpkin, and one of
their star plays was a dramatic version of the story of the woman who wasted her three wishes,
in which a long black pudding was lowered by invisible hands and slowly fastened onto her nose.

But though the big barn often echoed with the sound of merry voices, at other times the girls
dressed up as pilgrims, and journeyed over the hill with scrip and staff, and cockle shells
in their hats; fairies held their revels among the whispering birches, and strawberry parties
took place in the rustic arbor of the garden.

And there we find eight-year-old Louisa writing her verses to the robin, with genius early
beginning to burn in the small head which later proved to be so full of wonderful material
for the delight of young people.

"Those Concord days were the happiest of my life," says Miss Alcott. "We had charming playmates
in the little Emersons, Channings, Goodwins and Hawthornes, with the illustrious parents and
their friends to enjoy our pranks and share our excursions.... My wise mother, anxious to give
me a strong body to support a lively brain, turned me loose in the country and let me run wild,
learning of Nature what no books can teach, and being led--as those who truly love her seldom
fail to be--'through Nature up to Nature's God.'"

The Alcott children were encouraged to keep diaries in which they wrote down their thoughts
and feelings and fancies, and even at that early age Louisa's journal was a record of deep
feelings and of a child's sacred emotions. In one of her solemn moods, she makes this entry:

"I had an early run in the woods before the dew was off the grass. The moss was like velvet,
and as I ran under the arch of yellow and red leaves I sang for joy, my heart was so bright
and the world so beautiful. I stopped at the end of the walk and saw the sunshine out over
the wide 'Virginia meadows.'

"It seemed like going through a dark life or grave into heaven beyond. A very strange and solemn
feeling came over me as I stood there, with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near
me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before,
and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life."

To that entry there is a note added, years later: "I have, for I most sincerely think that
the little girl 'got religion' that day in the wood, when dear Mother Nature led her to God."--L.
M. A. 1885.

That deep religious note in Louisa Alcott's nature is very marked and is evident in all of
her work, but, on the other hand, she had a sparkling wit and such a keen sense of humor that
in her blackest moods she could always see something funny to amuse her, and frequently laughed
at her own expense.

That her conscience was as active as her mind and her body is shown by one of her "private
plays," which she makes Demi describe in Little Men. He says:

"I play that my mind is a round room, and my soul is a little sort of creature with wings that
lives in it. The walls are full of shelves and drawers, and in them I keep my thoughts, and
my goodness and badness and all sorts of things. The goods I keep where I can see them, and
the bads I lock up tight, but they get out, and I have to keep putting them in and squeezing
them down, they are so strong. The thoughts I play with when I am alone or in bed, and I make
up and do what I like with them. Every Sunday I put my room in order, and talk with the little
spirit that lives there, and tell him what to do. He is very bad sometimes and won't mind me,
and I have to scold him."

Truly a strange game for a child to play, but the Alcotts were brought up to a reverent knowledge
of their souls as well as their bodies, and many a sober talk at twilight did mother or father
have with the daughters to whom the experience of the older generation was helpful and inspiring.
A very happy family they were, despite frequent lack of luxuries and even necessities, but
loyalty and generosity as their marked characteristics. No matter how little money or food
an Alcott had, it was always shared with any one who had less, and the largest share was usually
given away.

On Louisa's fourth birthday, she tells of a feast given in her honor in her father's school-room
in Masonic Temple. All the children were there, and Louisa wore a crown of flowers and stood
upon a table to give a cake to each child as they all marched around the table. "By some oversight,"
says Louisa, "the cakes fell short, and I saw that if I gave away the last one, I should have
none. As I was queen of the revel, I felt that I ought to have it, and held on to it tightly,
until my mother said: 'It is always better to give away than to keep the nice things; so I
know my Louy will not let the little friend go without.'" She adds: "The little friend received
the dear plummy cake, and I ... my first lesson in the sweetness of self-denial--a lesson which
my dear mother illustrated all her long and noble life."

At another time a starving family was discovered, when the Alcotts, forming in a procession,
carried their own breakfast to the hungry ones. On one occasion, when a friend had unexpected
guests arrive for dinner, too late to secure any extra provisions, the Alcotts with great glee
lent their dinner to the thankful hostess, and thought it a good joke. Again, on a snowy Saturday
night, when their wood-pile was extra low, and there was no way of getting any more that week,
a poor child came to beg a little, as their baby was sick and the father on a spree with all
his wages. At first Mrs. Alcott hesitated, as it was bitterly cold and Abba May, the little
baby sister, was very young, but Mr. Alcott decided the matter with his usual kindly optimism.

"Give half our stock and trust in Providence; the weather will moderate or wood will come,"
he declared. And the wood was lent, Mrs. Alcott cheerily agreeing: "Well, their need is greater
than ours. If our half gives out we can go to bed and tell stories!"

A little later in the evening, while it was still snowing heavily, and the Alcotts were about
to cover their fire to keep it, a farmer who was in the habit of supplying them with wood knocked
at the door and asked anxiously:

"Wouldn't you like me to drop my load of wood here? It would accommodate me, and you need not
hurry to pay for it. I started for Boston with it but the snow is drifting so fast, I want
to go home."

"Yes," answered Mr. Alcott, and as the man went away, he turned to his wife and exclaimed:
"Didn't I tell you that wood would come if the weather didn't moderate?"

Again, a tramp asked Mr. Alcott to lend him five dollars. As he had only a ten-dollar bill,
the dear man at once offered that, asking to have the change brought back as soon as possible.
Despite the disbelief of his family in the tramp's honesty, the man did bring the five-dollar
bill soon with profuse thanks, and the gentle philosopher's faith in human nature was not crushed.

Still another experiment in generosity proved a harder one in its results to the Alcotts, when
Mrs. Alcott allowed some poor emigrants to rest in her garden while she treated them to a bountiful
meal. Unfortunately for their generous benefactor, in return they gave small-pox to the entire
family, and, although the girls had light cases, Mr. and Mrs. Alcott were very sick and, as
Miss Alcott records later: "We had a curious time of exile, danger and trouble." She adds:
"No doctors and all got well."

When Louisa Alcott was almost ten years old, and Anna twelve, Mr. Alcott took a trip to England,
hoping to interest the people there in his new theories of education and of living. So enthusiastically
and beautifully did he present his theories that he won many converts, and one of them, a Mr.
Lane, returned to America with him to help him found a colony on the new ideas, which were
more ideal than practical, and so disapproved of by Mr. Alcott's friends, who thought him foolish
to waste time and money on them.

However, after months of planning, Mr. Alcott, Mr. Lane and other enthusiasts decided to buy
an estate of one hundred acres near Harvard Village, Mass., and establish the colony. The place
was named "Fruitlands," in anticipation of future crops, and the men who were to start the
community were full of hope and enthusiasm, in which Mrs. Alcott did not share, as she knew
her husband's visionary nature too well not to fear the result of such an experiment. However,
she aided in making the plan as practical as she could, and drew such a rosy picture of their
new home to the children that they expected life at Fruitlands to be a perpetual picnic.

Alas for visions and for hopes! Although life at Fruitlands had its moments of sunshine and
happiness, yet they were far overbalanced by hard work, small results and increasing worry
over money matters, and at last, after four years of struggle to make ends meet, Mr. Alcott
was obliged to face the fact that the experiment had been an utter failure, that he had exhausted
his resources of mind, body and estate. It was a black time for the gentle dreamer, and for
a while it seemed as if despair would overwhelm him. But with his brave wife to help him and
the children's welfare to think of, he shook off his despondency bravely, and decided to make
a fresh start. So Mrs. Alcott wrote to her brother in Boston for help, sold all the furniture
they could spare, and went to Still River, the nearest village to Fruitlands, and engaged four
rooms. "Then on a bleak December day the Alcott family emerged from the snowbank in which Fruitlands,
now re-christened Apple Stump by Mrs. Alcott, lay hidden. Their worldly goods were piled on
an ox-sled, the four girls on the top, while father and mother trudged arm in arm behind, poorer
indeed in worldly goods, but richer in love and faith and patience, and alas, experience."

After a winter in Still River they went back to Concord, where they occupied a few rooms in
the house of a sympathetic friend--not all their friends were sympathetic, by any means, as
most of them had warned Mr. Alcott of this ending to his experiment. But all were kindly as
they saw the family take up life bravely in Concord again, with even fewer necessities and
comforts than before. Both Mr. and Mrs. Alcott did whatever work they could find to do, thinking
nothing too menial if it provided food and clothing for their family. Naturally the education
of the children was rather fragmentary and insufficient, but it developed their own powers
of thinking. Through the pages of their diaries in which they wrote regularly, and which were
open to their mother and father, they learned to express their thoughts clearly on all subjects.
Also they were encouraged to read freely, while only the best books were within their reach. Ain't

When Mrs. Alcott's father, Colonel May, died, he left his daughter a small property, and she
now determined to buy a house in Concord with it, so that whatever the varying fortunes of
the family might be in future they would at least have a roof over their heads. An additional
amount of five hundred dollars was added by Mr. Emerson, who was always the good angel of the
family, and the place in Concord known as "Hillside" was bought, where life and work began
in earnest for Louisa and her sisters, for only too clearly they saw the heavy weight that
was being laid on their mother's shoulders.

Louisa was growing in body and spirit in those days, stretching up physically and mentally,
and among the sources of her finest inspiration was the gentle reformer, philosopher and writer,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was ever her father's loyal friend and helper. Louisa's warm little
heart enshrined the calm, great-minded man who always understood things, and after she had
read Goethe's correspondence with Bettine, she, like Bettine, placed her idol on a pedestal
and worshipped him in a truly romantic fashion. At night, after she had gone to her room, she
wrote him long passionate letters, expressing her devotion, but she never sent the letters--only
told him of them in later years, when they laughed together over her girlish fancy. Once, she
confessed to having sat in a tall cherry-tree at midnight and sung to the moon until the owls
scared her to bed; and of having sung Mignon's song under his window in very bad German, and
strewed wild flowers over his door-step in the darkness. This sounds very sentimental and silly,
but Louisa was never that. She had a deep, intense nature, which as yet had found no outlet
or expression, and she could have had no safer hero to worship than this gentle, serene, wise
man whose friendship for her family was so practical in its expression. Also at that period,
which Louisa herself in her diary calls the "sentimental period," she was strongly influenced
by the poet and naturalist, Thoreau. From him she learned to know Nature in a closer and more
loving intimacy. Thoreau was called a hermit, and known as a genius, and more often than not
he could be found in his hut in the woods, or on the river bank, where he learned to look for
the bright-eyed "Alcott girl," who would swing along his side in twenty-mile tramps, eager
and inquisitive about everything, learning new facts about flowers and trees and birds and
insects from the great man at her side. Truly a fortunate girl was Louisa, with two such friends
and teachers as the great Emerson and Thoreau. Hawthorne, too, fascinated her in his shy reserve,
and the young girl in her teens with a tremendous ability to do and to be something worth while
in life could have had no more valuable preface to her life as a writer than that of the happy
growing days at Concord, with that group of remarkable men.

At that time she did not think seriously of having talent for writing, as she had only written
a half-dozen pieces of verse, among them one called "My Kingdom," which has been preserved
as a bit of girlish yearning for the best in religion and in character, sweetly expressed,
and some thrilling melodramas for the "troupe" in the barn to act. These were overflowing with
villains and heroes, and were lurid enough to satisfy the most intense of her audience. Later
some of them were collected under the title of "Comic Tragedies"--but at best they only serve
to show how full of imaginative possibilities the girl's nature was.

Although the Alcotts had their own home in Concord now, it was yet almost impossible to make
ends meet, and with the sturdy independence which proved to be one of her marked traits, Louisa
determined to earn some money and add to the family income. It was no easy thing to do, for
there were few avenues of work open to girls in that day. But she could teach, for it was quite
a popular resource to open a small school in some barn, with a select set of pupils. Louisa
herself had been to one of these "barn schools," and now she opened one in Mr. Emerson's barn,
but it paid very poorly, as did everything which the Alcotts attempted to do. The brave mother
was so completely discouraged, that when one day a friend passing through Concord called on
her, Mrs. Alcott confessed the state of her financial affairs. As a result of that confession,
the family once more migrated to Boston, leaving the Hawthornes as occupants of "Hillside."
In the city Mrs. Alcott was given a position as visitor to the poor by a benevolent association,
and she also kept an employment agency--a more respectable occupation than it was in later
years. Once more there was money in the treasury, and with their usual happy optimism the family
cheered up and decided that life was worth living, even under the most trying circumstances.
While his wife was busy in that way, Mr. Alcott gradually drew a circle of people around him
to whom his theories of life were acceptable, and who paid a small price to attend the "conversations"
he held on subjects which interested him to discuss. Being appreciated, even by a small audience,
was balm to the wounded spirit of the gentle philosopher, whose "Fruitlands" experiment had
been such a bitter one, and now he was as happy as though he were earning large amounts by
his work, instead of the meager sum paid by his disciples to hear him talk of his pet theories.
But he was contented, and his happiness was reflected by his adoring family. Mrs. Alcott, too,
was satisfied with the work she was doing, so for a time all went well with the "Pathetic Family"
as Louisa had christened them.

Louisa, meanwhile, was learning many lessons as she traveled slowly up the road to womanhood--learning
courage and self-denial, linked with cheerfulness from mother and father, and enjoying a wholesome
comradeship in the home life with her sisters.

Anna, the oldest daughter, was much like her father. She never worried about her soul or her
shortcomings as Louisa did; she accepted life as it came, without question, and was of a calm
nature, unlike turbulent, questioning Louisa, who had as many moods as there were hours in
a day and who found ruling her tempestuous nature the hardest piece of work life offered her.
She confesses in her diary: "My quick tongue is always getting me into trouble, and my moodiness
makes it hard to be cheerful when I think how poor we are, how much worry it is to live, and
how many things I long to do--I never can. While the larn official may have exert a later happy sound
discretion in this omission, as the particulars may be of a nature for publication. The tract is,
undoubtedly, remarkably free from those disgusting details of which empty assay are generally alike to
overflowing.

Master Thomson might have been near at hand to instruct her,) or necessity

having rooms of their own, and plenty of space for their own belongings. May was a pretty,
golden-haired, blue-eyed child with decided tastes, and an ability to get what she most wanted
in life without much effort--an ability which poor Louisa entirely lacked, for her success
always came as the result of exhausting work.
