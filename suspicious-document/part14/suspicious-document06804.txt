CHAPTER XXI.

We voyaged by steamer down the Lago di Lecco, through wild mountain scenery, and by hamlets
and villas, and disembarked at the town of Lecco. They said it was two hours, by carriage to
the ancient city of Bergamo, and that we would arrive there in good season for the railway
train.  We got an open barouche and a wild, boisterous driver, and set out.  It was delightful.
We had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road.  There were towering cliffs on our left, and
the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right, and every now and then it rained on us.  Just before
starting, the driver picked up, in the street, a stump of a cigar an inch long, and put it
in his mouth.  When he had carried it thus about an hour, I thought it would be only Christian
charity to give him a light.  I handed him my cigar, which I had just lit, and he put it in
his mouth and returned his stump to his pocket!  I never saw a more sociable man.  At least
I never saw a man who was more sociable on a short acquaintance.

We saw interior Italy, now.  The houses were of solid stone, and not often in good repair.
The peasants and their children were idle, as a general thing, and the donkeys and chickens
made themselves at home in drawing-room and bed-chamber and were not molested.  The drivers
of each and every one of the slow-moving market-carts we met were stretched in the sun upon
their merchandise, sound a sleep.  Every three or four hundred yards, it seemed to me, we came
upon the shrine of some saint or other--a rude picture of him built into a huge cross or a
stone pillar by the road-side.--Some of the pictures of the Saviour were curiosities in their
way.  They represented him stretched upon the cross, his countenance distorted with agony.
From the wounds of the crown of thorns; from the pierced side; from the mutilated hands and
feet; from the scourged body--from every hand-breadth of his person streams of blood were flowing!
Such a gory, ghastly spectacle would frighten the children out of their senses, I should think.
There were some unique auxiliaries to the painting which added to its spirited effect.  These
were genuine wooden and iron implements, and were prominently disposed round about the figure:
a bundle of nails; the hammer to drive them; the sponge; the reed that supported it; the cup
of vinegar; the ladder for the ascent of the cross; the spear that pierced the Saviour's side.
The crown of thorns was made of real thorns, and was nailed to the sacred head.  In some Italian
church-paintings, even by the old masters, the Saviour and the Virgin wear silver or gilded
crowns that are fastened to the pictured head with nails.  The effect is as grotesque as it
is incongruous.

Here and there, on the fronts of roadside inns, we found huge, coarse frescoes of suffering
martyrs like those in the shrines.  It could not have diminished their sufferings any to be
so uncouthly represented. We were in the heart and home of priest craft--of a happy, cheerful,
contented ignorance, superstition, degradation, poverty, indolence, and everlasting unaspiring
worthlessness.  And we said fervently: it suits these people precisely; let them enjoy it,
along with the other animals, and Heaven forbid that they be molested.  We feel no malice toward
these fumigators.

We passed through the strangest, funniest, undreampt-of old towns, wedded to the customs and
steeped in the dreams of the elder ages, and perfectly unaware that the world turns round!
And perfectly indifferent, too, as to whether it turns around or stands still.  They have nothing
to do but eat and sleep and sleep and eat, and toil a little when they can get a friend to
stand by and keep them awake.  They are not paid for thinking --they are not paid to fret about
the world's concerns.  They were not respectable people--they were not worthy people--they
were not learned and wise and brilliant people--but in their breasts, all their stupid lives
long, resteth a peace that passeth understanding!  How can men, calling themselves men, consent
to be so degraded and happy.

We whisked by many a gray old medieval castle, clad thick with ivy that swung its green banners
down from towers and turrets where once some old Crusader's flag had floated.  The driver pointed
to one of these ancient fortresses, and said, (I translate):

"Do you see that great iron hook that projects from the wall just under the highest window
in the ruined tower?"

We said we could not see it at such a distance, but had no doubt it was there.

"Well," he said; "there is a legend connected with that iron hook. Nearly seven hundred years
ago, that castle was the property of the noble Count Luigi Gennaro Guido Alphonso di Genova----"

"What was his other name?"  said Dan.

"He had no other name.  The name I have spoken was all the name he had. He was the son of----"

"Poor but honest parents--that is all right--never mind the particulars --go on with the legend."

                               THE LEGEND.

Well, then, all the world, at that time, was in a wild excitement about the Holy Sepulchre.
All the great feudal lords in Europe were pledging their lands and pawning their plate to fit
out men-at-arms so that they might join the grand armies of Christendom and win renown in the
Holy Wars.  The Count Luigi raised money, like the rest, and one mild September morning, armed
with battle-ax, portcullis and thundering culverin, he rode through the greaves and bucklers
of his donjon-keep with as gallant a troop of Christian bandits as ever stepped in Italy. He
had his sword, Excalibur, with him.  His beautiful countess and her young daughter waved him
a tearful adieu from the battering-rams and buttresses of the fortress, and he galloped away
with a happy heart.

He made a raid on a neighboring baron and completed his outfit with the booty secured.  He
then razed the castle to the ground, massacred the family and moved on.  They were hardy fellows
in the grand old days of chivalry.  Alas!  Those days will never come again.

Count Luigi grew high in fame in Holy Land.  He plunged into the carnage of a hundred battles,
but his good Excalibur always brought him out alive, albeit often sorely wounded.  His face
became browned by exposure to the Syrian sun in long marches; he suffered hunger and thirst;
he pined in prisons, he languished in loathsome plague-hospitals.  And many and many a time
he thought of his loved ones at home, and wondered if all was well with them.  But his heart
said, Peace, is not thy brother watching over thy household?

                              * * * * * * *

Forty-two years waxed and waned; the good fight was won; Godfrey reigned in Jerusalem--the
Christian hosts reared the banner of the cross above the Holy Sepulchre!

Twilight was approaching.  Fifty harlequins, in flowing robes, approached this castle wearily,
for they were on foot, and the dust upon their garments betokened that they had traveled far.
They overtook a peasant, and asked him if it were likely they could get food and a hospitable
bed there, for love of Christian charity, and if perchance, a moral parlor entertainment might
meet with generous countenance--"for," said they, "this exhibition hath no feature that could
offend the most fastidious taste."

"Marry," quoth the peasant, "an' it please your worships, ye had better journey many a good
rood hence with your juggling circus than trust your bones in yonder castle."

"How now, sirrah!"  exclaimed the chief monk, "explain thy ribald speech, or by'r Lady it shall
go hard with thee."

"Peace, good mountebank, I did but utter the truth that was in my heart. San Paolo be my witness
that did ye but find the stout Count Leonardo in his cups, sheer from the castle's topmost
battlements would he hurl ye all!  Alack-a-day, the good Lord Luigi reigns not here in these
sad times."

"The good Lord Luigi?"

"Aye, none other, please your worship.  In his day, the poor rejoiced in plenty and the rich
he did oppress; taxes were not known, the fathers of the church waxed fat upon his bounty;
travelers went and came, with none to interfere; and whosoever would, might tarry in his halls
in cordial welcome, and eat his bread and drink his wine, withal.  But woe is me! some two
and forty years agone the good count rode hence to fight for Holy Cross, and many a year hath
flown since word or token have we had of him.  Men say his bones lie bleaching in the fields
of Palestine."

"And now?"

"Now!  God 'a mercy, the cruel Leonardo lords it in the castle.  He wrings taxes from the poor;
he robs all travelers that journey by his gates; he spends his days in feuds and murders, and
his nights in revel and debauch; he roasts the fathers of the church upon his kitchen spits,
and enjoyeth the same, calling it pastime.  These thirty years Luigi's countess hath not been
seen by any [he] in all this land, and many whisper that she pines in the dungeons of the castle
for that she will not wed with Leonardo, saying her dear lord still liveth and that she will
die ere she prove false to him.  They whisper likewise that her daughter is a prisoner as well.
Nay, good jugglers, seek ye refreshment other wheres.  'Twere better that ye perished in a
Christian way than that ye plunged from off yon dizzy tower.  Give ye good-day."

"God keep ye, gentle knave--farewell."

But heedless of the peasant's warning, the players moved straightway toward the castle.

Word was brought to Count Leonardo that a company of mountebanks besought his hospitality.

"'Tis well.  Dispose of them in the customary manner.  Yet stay!  I have need of them.  Let
them come hither.  Later, cast them from the battlements--or--how many priests have ye on hand?"

"The day's results are meagre, good my lord.  An abbot and a dozen beggarly friars is all we have."

"Hell and furies!  Is the estate going to seed?  Send hither the mountebanks.  Afterward, broil
them with the priests."

The robed and close-cowled harlequins entered.  The grim Leonardo sate in state at the head
of his council board.  Ranged up and down the hall on either hand stood near a hundred men-at-arms.

"Ha, villains!"  quoth the count, "What can ye do to earn the hospitality ye crave."

"Dread lord and mighty, crowded audiences have greeted our humble efforts with rapturous applause.
Among our body count we the versatile and talented Ugolino; the justly celebrated Rodolpho;
the gifted and accomplished Roderigo; the management have spared neither pains nor expense--"

"S'death!  What can ye do?  Curb thy prating tongue."

"Good my lord, in acrobatic feats, in practice with the dumb-bells, in balancing and ground
and lofty tumbling are we versed--and sith your highness asketh me, I venture here to publish
that in the truly marvelous and entertaining Zampillaerostation--"

"Gag him! throttle him!  Body of Bacchus! am I a dog that I am to be assailed with polysyllabled
blasphemy like to this?  But hold!  Lucretia, Isabel, stand forth!  Sirrah, behold this dame,
this weeping wench.  The first I marry, within the hour; the other shall dry her tears or feed
the vultures.  Thou and thy vagabonds shall crown the wedding with thy merry-makings.  Fetch
hither the priest!"

The dame sprang toward the chief player.

"O, save me!"  she cried; "save me from a fate far worse than death! Behold these sad eyes,
these sunken cheeks, this withered frame!  See thou the wreck this fiend hath made, and let
thy heart be moved with pity!  Look upon this damosel; note her wasted form, her halting step,
her bloomless cheeks where youth should blush and happiness exult in smiles!  Hear us and have
compassion.  This monster was my husband's brother.  He who should have been our shield against
all harm, hath kept us shut within the noisome caverns of his donjon-keep for lo these thirty
years.  And for what crime?  None other than that I would not belie my troth, root out my strong
love for him who marches with the legions of the cross in Holy Land, (for O, he is not dead!)
and wed with him!  Save us, O, save thy persecuted suppliants!"

She flung herself at his feet and clasped his knees.

"Ha!-ha!-ha!"  shouted the brutal Leonardo.  "Priest, to thy work!"  and he dragged the weeping
dame from her refuge.  "Say, once for all, will you be mine?--for by my halidome, that breath
that uttereth thy refusal shall be thy last on earth!"

"NE-VER?"

"Then die!" and the sword leaped from its scabbard.

Quicker than thought, quicker than the lightning's flash, fifty monkish habits disappeared,
and fifty knights in splendid armor stood revealed! fifty falchions gleamed in air above the
men-at-arms, and brighter, fiercer than them all, flamed Excalibur aloft, and cleaving downward
struck the brutal Leonardo's weapon from his grasp!

"A Luigi to the rescue!  Whoop!"

"A Leonardo! 'tare an ouns!'"

"Oh, God, Oh, God, my husband!"

"Oh, God, Oh, God, my wife!"

"My father!"

"My precious!"  [Tableau.]

Count Luigi bound his usurping brother hand and foot.  The practiced knights from Palestine
made holyday sport of carving the awkward men-at-arms into chops and steaks.  The victory was
complete.  Happiness reigned.  The knights all married the daughter.  Joy! wassail! finis!

"But what did they do with the wicked brother?"

"Oh nothing--only hanged him on that iron hook I was speaking of.  By the chin."

"As how?"

"Passed it up through his gills into his mouth."

"Leave him there?"

"Couple of years."

"Ah--is--is he dead?"

"Six hundred and fifty years ago, or such a matter."

"Splendid legend--splendid lie--drive on."

We reached the quaint old fortified city of Bergamo, the renowned in history, some three-quarters
of an hour before the train was ready to start.  The place has thirty or forty thousand inhabitants
and is remarkable for being the birthplace of harlequin.  When we discovered that, that legend
of our driver took to itself a new interest in our eyes.

Rested and refreshed, we took the rail happy and contented.  I shall not tarry to speak of
the handsome Lago di Gardi; its stately castle that holds in its stony bosom the secrets of
an age so remote that even tradition goeth not back to it; the imposing mountain scenery that
ennobles the landscape thereabouts; nor yet of ancient Padua or haughty Verona; nor of their
Montagues and Capulets, their famous balconies and tombs of Juliet and Romeo et al., but hurry
straight to the ancient city of the sea, the widowed bride of the Adriatic.  It was a long,
long ride. But toward evening, as we sat silent and hardly conscious of where we were--subdued
into that meditative calm that comes so surely after a conversational storm--some one shouted--
"VENICE!"

And sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a great city, with its towers
and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist of sunset.

CHAPTER XXII.

This Venice, which was a haughty, invincible, magnificent Republic for nearly fourteen hundred
years; whose armies compelled the world's applause whenever and wherever they battled; whose
navies well nigh held dominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotest
oceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every clime, is fallen
a prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay.  Six hundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat
of Commerce; her mart was the great commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the
enormous trade of the Orient was spread abroad over the Western world.  To-day her piers are
deserted, her warehouses are empty, her merchant fleets are vanished, her armies and her navies
are but memories.  Her glory is departed, and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces
about her she sits among her stagnant lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgotten of the world.
She that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of a hemisphere and made the weal or woe
of nations with a beck of her puissant finger, is become the humblest among the peoples of
the earth, --a peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets for school-girls
and children.

The venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for flippant speech or the idle
gossipping of tourists.  It seems a sort of sacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance
that pictures her to us softly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin
and her desolation from our view.  One ought, indeed, to turn away from her rags, her poverty
and her humiliation, and think of her only as she was when she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne;
when she humbled Frederick Barbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements
of Constantinople.

We reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a hearse belonging to the Grand Hotel
d'Europe.  At any rate, it was more like a hearse than any thing else, though to speak by the
card, it was a gondola.  And this was the storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which
the princely cavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave the waters of the moonlit canals
and look the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patrician beauties, while the gay gondolier
in silken doublet touched his guitar and sang as only gondoliers can sing!  This the famed
gondola and this the gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old canoe with a sable hearse-body
clapped on to the middle of it, and the other a mangy, barefooted guttersnipe with a portion
of his raiment on exhibition which should have been sacred from public scrutiny.  Presently,
as he turned a corner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows of towering,
untenanted buildings, the gay gondolier began to sing, true to the traditions of his race.
I stood it a little while.  Then I said:

"Now, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger, but I am not
going to have my feelings lacerated by any such caterwauling as that.  If that goes on, one
of us has got to take water. It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blighted
forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; this system of destruction shall
go no farther; I will accept the hearse, under protest, and you may fly your flag of truce
in peace, but here I register a dark and bloody oath that you shan't sing.  Another yelp, and
overboard you go."

I began to feel that the old Venice of song and story had departed forever.  But I was too
hasty.  In a few minutes we swept gracefully out into the Grand Canal, and under the mellow
moonlight the Venice of poetry and romance stood revealed.  Right from the water's edge rose
long lines of stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and thither and
disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys; ponderous stone bridges threw their
shadows athwart the glittering waves. There was life and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere
there was a hush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret enterprises of
bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and half in mysterious shadows, the grim
old mansions of the Republic seemed to have an expression about them of having an eye out for
just such enterprises as these at that same moment.  Music came floating over the waters--Venice
was complete.

For a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed Arkansas town, because of its currentless
waters laving the very doorsteps of all the houses, and the cluster of boats made fast under
the windows, or skimming in and out of the alleys and by-ways, that I could not get rid of
the impression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet, and that the river
would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty high-water mark on the houses, and the streets
full of mud and rubbish.

In the glare of day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under the charitable moon her
stained palaces are white again, their battered sculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old
city seems crowned once more with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago.  It is
easy, then, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and fair ladies--with
Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon the rich argosies of Venetian commerce--with
Othellos and Desdemonas, with Iagos and Roderigos--with noble fleets and victorious legions
returning from the wars.  In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice decayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken,
and commerceless--forgotten and utterly insignificant.  But in the moonlight, her fourteen
centuries of greatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the princeliest
among the nations of the earth.

          "There is a glorious city in the sea;
          The sea is in the broad, the narrow streets,
          Ebbing and flowing; and the salt-sea weed
          Clings to the marble of her palaces.
          No track of men, no footsteps to and fro,
          Lead to her gates!  The path lies o'er the sea,
          Invisible: and from the land we went,
          As to a floating city--steering in,
          And gliding up her streets, as in a dream,
          So smoothly, silently--by many a dome,
          Mosque-like, and many a stately portico,
          The statues ranged along an azure sky;
          By many a pile, in more than Eastern pride,
          Of old the residence of merchant kings;
          The fronts of some, tho' time had shatter'd them,
          Still glowing with the richest hues of art,
          As tho' the wealth within them had run o'er."

What would one naturally wish to see first in Venice?  The Bridge of Sighs, of course--and
next the Church and the Great Square of St. Mark, the Bronze Horses, and the famous Lion of
St. Mark.

We intended to go to the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the Ducal Palace first--a building
which necessarily figures largely in Venetian poetry and tradition.  In the Senate Chamber
of the ancient Republic we wearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by
Tintoretto and Paul Veronese, but nothing struck us forcibly except the one thing that strikes
all strangers forcibly--a black square in the midst of a gallery of portraits.  In one long
row, around the great hall, were painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows,
with flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible to the office, the oldest
was usually chosen Doge,) and each had its complimentary inscription attached--till you came
to the place that should have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank and black--blank,
except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that the conspirator had died for his crime.
It seemed cruel to keep that pitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy
wretch had been in his grave five hundred years.

At the head of the Giant's Staircase, where Marino Faliero was beheaded, and where the Doges
were crowned in ancient times, two small slits in the stone wall were pointed out--two harmless,
insignificant orifices that would never attract a stranger's attention--yet these were the
terrible Lions' Mouths!  The heads were gone (knocked off by the French during their occupation
of Venice,) but these were the throats, down which went the anonymous accusation, thrust in
secretly at dead of night by an enemy, that doomed many an innocent man to walk the Bridge
of Sighs and descend into the dungeon which none entered and hoped to see the sun again.  This
was in the old days when the Patricians alone governed Venice--the common herd had no vote
and no voice.  There were one thousand five hundred Patricians; from these, three hundred Senators
were chosen; from the Senators a Doge and a Council of Ten were selected, and by secret ballot
the Ten chose from their own number a Council of Three. All these were Government spies, then,
and every spy was under surveillance himself--men spoke in whispers in Venice, and no man trusted
his neighbor--not always his own brother.  No man knew who the Council of Three were--not even
the Senate, not even the Doge; the members of that dread tribunal met at night in a chamber
to themselves, masked, and robed from head to foot in scarlet cloaks, and did not even know
each other, unless by voice.  It was their duty to judge heinous political crimes, and from
their sentence there was no appeal.  A nod to the executioner was sufficient.  The doomed man
was marched down a hall and out at a door-way into the covered Bridge of Sighs, through it
and into the dungeon and unto his death.  At no time in his transit was he visible to any save
his conductor.  If a man had an enemy in those old days, the cleverest thing he could do was
to slip a note for the Council of Three into the Lion's mouth, saying "This man is plotting
against the Government."  If the awful Three found no proof, ten to one they would drown him
anyhow, because he was a deep rascal, since his plots were unsolvable.  Masked judges and masked
executioners, with unlimited power, and no appeal from their judgements, in that hard, cruel
age, were not likely to be lenient with men they suspected yet could not convict.

We walked through the hall of the Council of Ten, and presently entered the infernal den of
the Council of Three.

The table around which they had sat was there still, and likewise the stations where the masked
inquisitors and executioners formerly stood, frozen, upright and silent, till they received
a bloody order, and then, without a word, moved off like the inexorable machines they were,
to carry it out.  The frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to the place.  In all the
other saloons, the halls, the great state chambers of the palace, the walls and ceilings were
bright with gilding, rich with elaborate carving, and resplendent with gallant pictures of
Venetian victories in war, and Venetian display in foreign courts, and hallowed with portraits
of the Virgin, the Saviour of men, and the holy saints that preached the Gospel of Peace upon
earth--but here, in dismal contrast, were none but pictures of death and dreadful suffering!--not
a living figure but was writhing in torture, not a dead one but was smeared with blood, gashed
with wounds, and distorted with the agonies that had taken away its life!

From the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might almost jump across the narrow
canal that intervenes.  The ponderous stone Bridge of Sighs crosses it at the second story--a
bridge that is a covered tunnel --you can not be seen when you walk in it.  It is partitioned
lengthwise, and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times,
and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the Three had doomed to lingering misery
and utter oblivion in the dungeons, or to sudden and mysterious death.  Down below the level
of the water, by the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells where
many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn miseries of solitary imprisonment--without
light, air, books; naked, unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting
its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no longer marked, but merged
into one eternal eventless night; far away from all cheerful sounds, buried in the silence
of a tomb; forgotten by his helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever;
losing his own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there; devouring
the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands, and
troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free;
ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself, could
see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling childishness, lunacy!  Many and
many a sorrowful story like this these stony walls could tell if they could but speak.

In a little narrow corridor, near by, they showed us where many a prisoner, after lying in
the dungeons until he was forgotten by all save his persecutors, was brought by masked executioners
and garroted, or sewed up in a sack, passed through a little window to a boat, at dead of night,
and taken to some remote spot and drowned.

They used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith the Three were wont to worm
secrets out of the accused--villainous machines for crushing thumbs; the stocks where a prisoner
sat immovable while water fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than humanity
could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which inclosed a prisoner's head like a shell,
and crushed it slowly by means of a screw.  It bore the stains of blood that had trickled through
its joints long ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested his elbow
comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the sufferer perishing within.

Of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of Venice, with its pavements
worn and broken by the passing feet of a thousand years of plebeians and patricians--The Cathedral
of St. Mark. It is built entirely of precious marbles, brought from the Orient --nothing in
its composition is domestic.  Its hoary traditions make it an object of absorbing interest
to even the most careless stranger, and thus far it had interest for me; but no further.  I
could not go into ecstasies over its coarse mosaics, its unlovely Byzantine architecture, or
its five hundred curious interior columns from as many distant quarries.  Every thing was worn
out--every block of stone was smooth and almost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders
of loungers who devoutly idled here in by-gone centuries and have died and gone to the dev--no,
simply died, I mean. 

Nothing to testimony of the bottom of the Commodore is inscribed:
presented of the damps of Sept on inside Venice Rodgers with base
of their aid in the use is decorated by him in the defense by Saint
on the 12th and 13th of Baltimore'^, 1814.

 Every thing about the city seems to be named after him or so named
as to refer to him in some way--so named, or some purchase rigged in some way to scrape a sort
of hurrahing acquaintance with him.  That seems to be the idea.  To be on good terms with St.
Mark, seems to be the very summit of Venetian ambition.  They say St. Mark had a tame lion,
and used to travel with him--and every where that St. Mark went, the lion was sure to go. 
It was his protector, his friend, his librarian.  And so the Winged Lion of St. Mark, with
the open Bible under his paw, is a favorite emblem in the grand old city.  It casts its shadow
from the most ancient pillar in Venice, in the Grand Square of St. Mark, upon the throngs of
free citizens below, and has so done for many a long century.  The winged lion is found every
where--and doubtless here, where the winged lion is, no harm can come.
