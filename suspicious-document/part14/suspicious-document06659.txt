Before leaving the animal kingdom of these forest regions, which I have here sketched only
briefly and fragmentally, I must notice two insects, the Cucaracha and the Chilicabra, species
of the Cockroach (Blatta). They are exceedingly numerous and troublesome. The Cucaracha, which
more particularly infests the deep regions of the forest, is an inch and a half long, and above
half an inch broad; it is reddish brown, with a yellow neck. The Chilicabra, though smaller,
is more mischievous, by reason of its greater numbers. They settle in the huts, where they
destroy provisions, gnaw clothes, get into beds, and into the dishes at meal time. These insects
defy every precaution that can be taken against their tormenting attacks. Luckily, nature has
provided enemies for their destruction. Among these is a small reddish yellow ant, called by
the Indians, the Pucchu-çiçi, a useful member of the ant family, for it pursues and destroys
the mischievous cockroaches. There is also a very elegant little bird, called the Cucarachero
(Troglodytes audax, Tsch.) which wages war against these insects. On seizing one of them it
first bites off the head, then devours the body, and throws away the tough wings. These operations
being completed, it hops to the nearest bush, and tunes its melodious song, the sounds of which
closely resemble the words "Acabe la tarea!" a name which the Indians give to this bird.[96]
I could yet fill many pages with descriptions of insects which are dangerous or troublesome,
and among them are included the julus, measuring six inches in length, the large black and
red scorpion, not forgetting the numerous poisonous wasps and the cicadas. However, those which
have been noticed will suffice to afford an idea of the ever-active movements of animal life
in the forests.

Willingly would I take a view of the vegetation of the virgin forests, and attempt to sketch
its progressive developments and alternations from the hilly Montañas of the eastern declivities
of the Andes to the humid level banks of the larger rivers; but I do not feel myself competent
to undertake a labor to which former travellers intimately acquainted with the world of plants
have already rendered full justice.[97] Being devoted to the study of zoology, and, unfortunately,
too little familiar with botany, I have confined myself to a description of the general impression
produced by the luxuriant growth of the soil, without entering into the individualities of
the vegetation. In the more highly situated Montañas, where the cinchona is found in the place
of its nativity, the gigantic orchidæ, the numerous fern plants, the tree-like nettles, the
wonderful bignonias, and the numerous, impenetrable complications of climbing plants, powerfully
rivet the attention of the observer. Lower down, in the lighter forest soil, amidst numerous
shrubs and climbers, the eye delights to dwell on the manifold forms of the stately palm, on
the terebinthaceæ, on the thickly-leaved balsam-yielding leguminosæ, on the luxuriant laurels,
on the pandaneæ or the large-leaved heliconias, and on the solaneæ, with their gigantic blossoms
and thousands of flowers. Descending still further, the flat lands of the forest assume a dark
and gloomy aspect. The massive foliage of trees overarches stems which are the growth of centuries,
and form a canopy almost impervious to the light of day. On the slimy soil no small shrub uprears
its head, no flowering plant unfolds its blossom. The mighty trees stand alone, and erect in
rows, like gravestones in a churchyard; and the child of darkness--the rapidly-shooting mushroom--finds
genial nurture on the warm humid earth.

 The soil is very fruitful, and the locality is less than
some others infested with troublesome insects; yet it is but scantily peopled, for, besides
the two villages and the Hacienda of Maraynioc, already mentioned, it contains only a few scattered
chacras. The inhabitants of this, the most favored district of the Montañas, scarcely amount
to 200. The villagers employ themselves chiefly in the cultivation of pines, which are sent
to Lima. The Indians of Palca and Tapo bring them potatoes, salt, and butcher's meat, for which
the villagers exchange their pine-apples. The fruit is conveyed by asses to the coast, where,
however, it seldom arrives in good condition. The other productions of the Montaña are maize,
oranges, bananas, paltas, Spanish pepper, &c.; but these articles are sold only in the Sierra.
Each inhabitant of the village cultivates his own piece of ground, which he can enlarge when
he pleases; but these people are too indolent to devote themselves seriously to agriculture.
It is only when the governor in Tarma compels them to pay the annual contribution, that they
make an effort to augment their earnings; they then seek a market for the products of their
cultivation, and sell them for ready money. Vitoc and some of the villages in its neighborhood
form altogether only one ecclesiastical community, whose pastor lives in Tarma the whole year
round. He goes to Pucara only once in six or eight months, to read a couple of masses, and
to solemnize marriages and christenings, but chiefly to collect fees for burials which may
have taken place during his absence.

The plantation of Pacchapata is of considerable extent, but produces very little. The system
of repartimientos, already described, by which the poor Indian is kept in a state of slavery
by advances of clothing, meat, brandy, &c., is practised in this hacienda to a great extent.
The laborer who is set down in the plantation-book as a debtor for ten or twelve dollars, has
a good chance of remaining during the rest of his life a tributary slave; for if he tries by
prolonged labor to relieve himself from the debt the owner of the plantation causes brandy
to be made, and this is too great a temptation to be resisted by an Indian. The butcher's meat
given to the laboring Indians in general consists of Chalonas, that is, the dried flesh of
sheep which have died in the haciendas of the hilly districts. For a meagre, tough, unwholesome
chalona the Indian has to add a dollar and a half or two dollars to his debt, while a living
sheep in the Sierra would not cost half the price. It is the same with other articles furnished
by the haciendas. European importations, such as can be purchased at very low prices in the
Sierra, are sold at high profits by the owners of plantations to the poor Indians, who have
to repay them by long and severe labor.

At Pacchapata, besides maize, yuccas, and fruits, sugar, coffee, and coca are also cultivated.
The sugar-cane grows in abundance, and is of good quality. An excellent kind of coffee is grown
here; the bean is slightly globular, and its color is a greenish blue. In former times the
viceroy used to send the coffee of Vitoc as a highly-esteemed present to the court of Madrid.
The coca is also very fine, and yields three harvests in the year; which, however, is only
the case in a few of the Montañas, as, for example, at Pangoa and Huanta. I may here subjoin
some notice of this highly interesting plant.

The coca (Erythroxylon coca, Lam.) is a shrub about six feet in height, with bright green leaves
and white blossoms. The latter are succeeded by small scarlet berries. It is raised from the
seed, in garden-beds called almazigas. When the young shoots are one and a half or two feet
high, they are removed to regularly laid out coca fields (cocales), where they are planted
at the distance of about three spans from each other. The coca requires humidity; therefore,
during the first year or two after it is planted in the fields, maize is sown between the matas,
or young shoots, to screen them from the too great influence of the sun. When the leaves are
ripe, that is to say, when on being bent they crack or break off, the gathering commences.
The leaves are stripped from the branches, a task usually performed by women, and it requires
great care lest the tender leaves and young twigs should be injured. In some districts, the
Indians are so very careful in gathering the coca, that, instead of stripping off the leaves,
they cut them from the stem by making an incision with their nails. The plant thus rendered
leafless is soon again overgrown with verdant foliage. After being gathered, the leaves are
spread out on coarse woollen cloths and dried in the sun. The color of the leaves when dried
is a pale green. The drying is an operation which likewise demands great care and attention,
for if the leaves imbibe damp, they become dark colored, and then they sell for a much lower
price than when they are green. The dry coca is finely packed in woollen sacks, and covered
with sand. These sacks are of various sizes and colors, in different parts of the Montañas.
In Huanuco they are grey or black, and when filled weigh from 75 to 80 pounds. In Vitoc they
are grey and white, and contain 150 pounds. In Huanta and Anco they are small in size, and
black or brown in color, and contain merely one aroba. In the Montañas of Urubamba, Calca,
and Paucartambo, the coca leaves are put into small baskets called cestos, and covered with
sand. Great care is also requisite in the carriage of the coca, for if damp be allowed to penetrate
the sack, the leaves become hot, or as the natives express it, Se calientan, and are thereby
rendered useless.

The Indians masticate the coca. Each individual carries a leathern pouch, called the huallqui,
or the chuspa, and a small flask gourd, called the ishcupuru. The pouch contains a supply of
coca leaves, and the gourd is filled with pulverised unslaked lime. Usually four times, but
never less than three times a day, the Indian suspends his labor, for the purpose of masticating
coca. This operation (which is termed chacchar or acullicar) is performed in the following
manner: some of the coca leaves, the stalks having been carefully picked off, are masticated
until they form a small ball, or as it is called an acullico. A thin slip of damp wood is then
thrust into the ishcupuru, or gourd, and when drawn out some portion of the powdered lime adheres
to it. The acullico, or ball of masticated coca leaves, is, whilst still lying in the mouth,
punctured with this slip of wood, until the lime mixing with it, gives it a proper relish,
and the abundant flow of saliva thus excited is partly expectorated and partly swallowed. When
the ball ceases to emit juice, it is thrown away, and a new one is formed by the mastication
of a fresh mouthfull of coca leaves. In Cerro de Pasco, and in places still further south,
the Indians use, instead of unslaked lime, a preparation of the pungent ashes of the quinua
(Chenopodium Quinua, L.). This preparation is called Llucta or Llipta. In using it a piece
is broken off and masticated along with the acullico. In some of the Montaña regions the Llucta
is made from the ashes of the musa root. The application of the unslaked lime demands some
precaution, for if it comes in direct contact with the lips and gums, it causes a very painful
burning. During a fatiguing ride across the level heights, where, owing to the cold wind, I
experienced a difficulty of respiration, my Arriero recommended me to chew coca, assuring me
that I would experience great relief from so doing. He lent me his huallqui, but owing to my
awkward manner of using it, I cauterized my lips so severely that I did not venture on a second
experiment.

The flavor of coca is not unpleasant. It is slightly bitter, aromatic, and similar to the worst
kind of green tea. When mixed with the ashes of the musa root it is somewhat piquant, and more
pleasant to European palates than it is without that addition. The smell of the fresh dried
leaves in a mass is almost overpowering; but this smell entirely goes when they are packed
in the sacks. All who masticate coca have a very bad breath, pale lips and gums, greenish and
stumpy teeth, and an ugly black mark at the angles of the mouth. An inveterate coquero, or
coca chewer, is known at the first glance. His unsteady gait, his yellow-colored skin, his
dim and sunken eyes encircled by a purple ring, his quivering lips and his general apathy,
all bear evidence of the baneful effects of the coca juice when taken in excess. All the mountain
Indians are addicted more or less to the practice of masticating coca. Each man consumes, on
the average, between an ounce and an ounce and a half per day, and on festival days about double
that quantity. The owners of mines and plantations allow their laborers to suspend their work
three times a day for the chacchar, which usually occupies upwards of a quarter of an hour;
and after that they smoke a paper cigar, which they allege crowns the zest of the coca mastication.
He who indulges for a time in the use of coca finds it difficult, indeed almost impossible,
to relinquish it. This fact I saw exemplified in the cases of several persons of high respectability
in Lima, who are in the habit of retiring daily to a private apartment for the purpose of masticating
coca. They could not do this openly, because among the refined class of Peruvians the chacchar
is looked upon as a low and vulgar practice, befitting only to the laboring Indians. Yet, Europeans
occasionally allow themselves to fall into this habit; and I knew two in Lima, the one an Italian
and the other a Biscayan, who were confirmed coqueros in the strictest sense of the word. In
Cerro de Pasco there are societies having even Englishmen for their members, which meet on
certain evenings for the chacchar. In these places, instead of lime or ashes, sugar is served
along with the coca leaves. A member of one of these clubs informed me that on the few first
trials the sugar was found very agreeable, but that afterwards the palate required some more
pungent ingredient.

The operation of the coca is similar to that of narcotics administered in small doses. Its
effects may be compared to those produced by the thorn-apple rather than to those arising from
opium. I have already noticed the consequences resulting from drinking the decoction of the
datura.[98] In the inveterate coquero similar symptoms are observable, but in a mitigated degree.
I may mention one circumstance attending the use of coca, which appears hitherto to have escaped
notice: it is, that after the mastication of a great quantity of coca the eye seems unable
to bear light, and there is a marked distension of the pupil. I have also observed this peculiarity
of the eye in one who had drunk a strong extract of the infusion of coca leaves. In the effects
consequent on the use of opium and coca there is this distinction, that coca, when taken even
in the utmost excess, never causes a total alienation of the mental powers or induces sleep;
but, like opium, it excites the sensibility of the brain, and the repeated excitement, occasioned
by its intemperate use after a series of years, wears out mental vigor and activity.

It is a well known fact, confirmed by long observation and experience, that the Indians who
regularly masticate coca require but little food, and, nevertheless, go through excessive labor
with apparent ease. They, therefore, ascribe the most extraordinary qualities to the coca,
and even believe that it might be made entirely a substitute for food. Setting aside all extravagant
and visionary notions on the subject, I am clearly of opinion that the moderate use of coca
is not merely innoxious, but that it may even be very conducive to health. In support of this
conclusion, I may refer to the numerous examples of longevity among Indians who, almost from
the age of boyhood, have been in the habit of masticating coca three times a day, and who in
the course of their lives have consumed no less than two thousand seven hundred pounds, yet,
nevertheless, enjoy perfect health.[99] The food of the Indians consists almost exclusively
of vegetable substances, especially roasted maize and barley converted into flour by crushing,
which they eat without the admixture of any other substance. The continued use of this farinaceous
food occasions severe obstructions, which the well known aperient qualities of the coca counteract,
and many serious diseases are thereby prevented. That the coca is in the highest degree nutritious,
is a fact beyond dispute. The incredible fatigues endured by the Peruvian infantry, with very
spare diet, but with the regular use of coca; the laborious toil of the Indian miner, kept
up, under similar circumstances, throughout a long series of years; certainly afford sufficient
ground for attributing to the coca leaves, not a quality of mere temporary stimulus, but a
powerful nutritive principle. Of the great power of the Indians in enduring fatigue with no
other sustenance than coca, I may here mention an example. A Cholo of Huari, named Hatun Huamang,
was employed by me in very laborious digging. During the whole time he was in my service, viz.,
five days and nights, he never tasted any food, and took only two hours' sleep nightly. But
at intervals of two and a half or three hours, he regularly masticated about half an ounce
of coca leaves, and he kept an acullico continually in his mouth. I was constantly beside him,
and therefore I had the opportunity of closely observing him. The work for which I engaged
him being finished, he accompanied me on a two days' journey of twenty-three leagues across
the level heights. Though on foot, he kept up with the pace of my mule, and halted only for
the chacchar. On leaving me, he declared that he would willingly engage himself again for the
same amount of work, and that he would go through it without food if I would but allow him
a sufficient supply of coca. Shortly has few move. Moses laid the place along half insects to hunting,
and leaned with the building there was awhile; then ran down on a
place.

The reason of the was the engineering on an elevator. Moses had not be seen that the barrel on an
edge. Of this fact I was fully convinced by
my own personal experience. I speak here, not of the mastication of the leaves, but of their
decoction taken as a beverage. When I was in the Puna, at the height of 14,000 feet above the
level of the sea, I drank, always before going out to hunt, a strong infusion of coca leaves.
I could then during the whole day climb the heights and follow the swift-footed wild animals
without experiencing any greater difficulty of breathing than I should have felt in similar
rapid movement on the coast. Moreover, I did not suffer from the symptoms of cerebral excitement
or uneasiness which other travellers have observed. The reason perhaps is, that I only drank
this decoction in the cold Puna, where the nervous system is far less susceptible than in the
climate of the forests. However, I always felt a sense of great satiety after taking the coca
infusion, and I did not feel a desire for my next meal until after the time at which I usually
took it.
