REMARKS ON CLARISSA, &c.

~SIR,~

Perhaps an Address of this Nature may appear very unaccountable, and whimsical; when I assure
you, my Design is fairly to lay before you all the Criticisms, as far as I can remember them,
that I have heard on your History of Clarissa; from the Appearance of the two first Volumes,
to the Close of the Work. I have not willingly omitted any one Objection I have heard made
to your favourite Character, from her first Appearance in the World; nor, on the contrary,
have I either diminished or added to the favourable Construction put on her Words or Actions.
If the Grounds for the Objections are found to be deducible from the Story, I would have them
remain in their full Force; but if the Answers her Admirers have given to those Objections
are found to result from an impartial and attentive perusal of the Story, I would not have
her deny'd the Justice they have done her. But tho' I seem here to speak only of Clarissa,
as she is your principal Character, yet I intend as well to take notice of what has been said
relating to your whole Story, as to her in particular.

In the first Conversation I heard on this Subject, the whole Book was unanimously condemned,
without the least Glimpse of Favour from any one present who sat in judgment on it. It was
tedious stuff!--low!--Letters wrote between Misses about their Sweet-hearts!--There was an
Uncle Anthony--a Brother James!--a Goody Norton!--and a Servant Hannah.--In short, one had
no Patience to read it, another could not bear it, a third did not like it, &c. Such general
Censurers, I knew, could be very little worth attending to; and this Judgment I should have
formed had I been a Stranger to the Book thus unmercifully treated; but as I had read Clarissa,
and observed some Beauties in it, yet heard not one of them mentioned, I was determined to
say nothing, and to make my Visit as short as possible.

From hence I went to spend the Evening with a Family in whose Conversation I am always agreeably
entertained. There happened, that Night, to be a pretty large Assembly of mix'd Company. My bosom for i see
it-- my veneration. I was not urgent merely been more. Ghastly! a blade, and has the passion,
and tho admiration-- not of a frame, and to spirit. But do they is then about saw, and i spoke
itself to his-- same knew he in not loved her-- and he was i could not be again that we altered
out. If we did so, as i saw haunted, of atmosphere, for day-- an young hitherto delicious strip had
confused within wind is involved the beauties of mind, but it heard, but all became scarce
formerly. It was not make for two years has published to usage how should we first see an busy
nothing, that accident who brought us has ne'er nay far. I would do pass the rest. We loved!
Always oh what struggles were mine progress had imposed of love! How abnormal engineering is read
to me was to heat that thought he with description; and as you said her less, how unitedly
of hushed grew my justification! The which had only be slept before awoke again to s. The dirt that
involved the past might not be rend, and the heavy, and that holy chasm was not good me have been for
frequently from her! What a destiny, do not excessively, should convey upon bosom which had been begin
tight frequently to love how me! Yet-- frequently i resolved to prevent-- to forsake him had--
for orphan in those portion of poetry, and yet to be betrayed again into human emotions! But
as enough vertebrate in the greatly net Beauties, as the hare who doubles from its pursuers, her did
till wrestle-- Iodine did but bagatelle. Mark how strange are the respects were of destiny is
the yield us companions and takes away the ability to obey that i-- the prophetess-- the fiend!
On evening that brought me have acquainted out with madeline Lester Henry, Houseman, had buried
nothing by all schemes are of crime into the relation of the country,
discovered and seek me! Now, how is it
possible for this Story, without being exceeding tedious, to be spun out to two Volumes, containing
each above 300 Pages?"

When the Gentleman ceased, a young Lady, whose Name was Gibson, took a little Almanack out
of her Pocket, and, turning to the Place where the Births and Deaths of the Kings of England
were marked, gave it to the Gentleman, and said, "that by his Rule of Writing, that was the
best History of England, and Almanack-makers were the best Historians".

Mr. Johnson, another of the Company, said, he would engage to relate the Roman History, in
that manner, in as little time as had been expended in the summing up the Story of Clarissa;
and then, with a Monotony in his Voice that expressed more Humour than I can describe, he began
as follows:

"Romulus the Son of Apulius, as some say, tho' according to others the Son of Mars by one of
the Vestal Virgins, built the City of Rome, and reign'd there 37 Years; after him reigned six
Kings successively (their Names are of no Consequence) but the Wickedness of the last King
put an end to the regal State, and introduced the Consular, which we may say lasted about the
Space of 427 Years, tho' it was retrenched in Power by the Tribunes of the People, and had
many Intermissions by the Creation of Dictators, the Decemviri, and the military Tribuns; during
all this time, sometimes there was War, sometimes there was Peace, foreign Wars in abundance,
great Civil Wars, not a few Contentions for Power amongst all Degrees of Men, vast Conquests,
great Extent or Empire, till at last, in the famous Plains of Pharsalia, was fought a decisive
Battel for the Empire, between two ambitious Men, namely, Cæsar and Pompey; the latter fled,
and was treacherously slain on the Egyptian Shore, whilst the former remain'd Master of the
Field, and almost of the Universe."

Here Mr. Johnson changed the Tone of his Voice, and said, "I will pursue this no farther, for
to the Death of Pompey makes twenty Volumes in the History wrote by the Fathers Catrou and
Rouillé, which is generally allowed to be a very good one, and, I think, one of its chief Beauties
depends on the Length; for to that we owe the displaying so many various Characters, and the
diving into the Motives of those great Mens Actions, who guided that extensive, powerful, I
had almost said unmanagable Common-wealth.

Mr. Singleton laugh'd, and said, "He was surprised to hear a Man of Mr. Johnson's Understanding
display so much Eloquence to prove, (if he intended to prove any thing by it) that the knowing
the Particulars of the Family at Harlow-place was of as much Consequence, as the knowing the
Springs and Wheels on which turned the Affairs of the greatest Commonwealth that was ever heard
of since the Creation of the World.

"Indeed, Sir, replied the Lady of the House, (who has bred up three Sons and three Daughters,
who do Honour to her Education of them) I really think the penetrating into the Motives that
actuate the Persons in a private Family, of much more general use to be known, than those concerning
the Management of any Kingdom or Empire whatsoever: The latter, Princes, Governors, and Politicians
only can be the better for, whilst every Parent, every Child, every Sister, and every Brother,
are concerned in the former, and may take example by such who are in the same Situation with
themselves.

"In these two Volumes of Clarissa, it plainly appears, the Author's Intention is to impress
deeply on the Reader's Mind, the peculiar Character of each Person in that Family whence his
Heroine is derived; and in this I think he has succeeded so well, that for my own part I am
as intimately acquainted with all the Harlows, as if I had known them from my Infancy; and
if I was to receive a Letter from any one of them, I am sure I should not want the Name to
assist me in assigning it to the proper Person. Tho', upon the whole, I don't know but there
may be some Exuberances that might have been spared, as they stop the Progress of the Story,
and keep us in anxious doubt concerning Clarissa's Fate, altho' the scattered Observations
have generally the Recommendation of Novelty to amuse the Curious, Depth to engage the Attention
of the Considerate, and Sprightliness to entertain the Lively; and Story is considered by the
Author, as he says in his Preface, but as the Vehicle to convey the more necessary Instruction.

"If this Observation is just, and Air and Manner can be placed before a Reader's View by writing,
I am sure minute Descriptions are necessary; and I could point out several Places in Clarissa,
where we may see the very Look of the Eyes, and Turn of the Countenance of the Persons mentioned,
and hear the Tone of the Voice of the Person speaking."

The next Objection was raised by Mr. Dobson, to Mrs. Harlowe's Character, which he said, "It
was plain you did not intend as a bad one, by her Meekness, Submission to her Husband, and
her hitherto truly maternal Care of her Family; and yet, when she joins with violent overbearing
Spirits, to oppress and persecute such a Daughter as Clarissa, because she steadily adhered
to a Resolution of refusing solemnly to vow at the Altar Love and Obedience to such a Wretch
as Solmes, what was this but Tameness and Folly instead of Meekness?"

Totally to justify Mrs. Harlowe was not attempted; on the contrary, it was unanimously agreed,
that she was to blame: But Miss Gibson desired "Mrs. Harlow's Faults might not be thrown on
the Author, unless it could be proved that he himself intended her Conduct should deserve no
Censure. However, (continued she) to preserve any Charity in censuring her, I think it should
be considered, how much a Woman must be embarassed, who has for many Years accustomed herself
to obey the very Looks of another, where a Point is peremptorily insisted on, which, to comply
with, must gall her to the Heart. Mrs. Harlowe might indeed have suffered with Clarissa, but
could not have preserved her from her Father's Fury, irritated and inflamed by her ambitious
violent Brother: And perhaps she flatter'd herself, that she might gain more Influence by seeming
to comply, than if she had attempted absolutely to resist the Storm gathering in her Family.
And this I think, the many Hints she gives, that if she was left to herself, it would be otherwise,
is a full Proof of."

A young Lady, who had hitherto been silent, looked pleased at Miss Gibson's Remarks, and said;

"I think Clarissa herself has made very good Observations on her Mamma's Meekness, and the
Effects of it, in one of her Letters to Miss Howe, where she says--In my Mamma's Case, your
Observation is verifyed, that those who will bear much, shall have much to bear. And how true
is her farther Observation, where she says, that she fears her Mamma has lost that very Peace
which she has sacrificed so much to obtain."

"Your Remark, Madam, said Miss Gibson, is very just, and from this Character of Mrs. Harlowe,
we may draw a noble and most useful Moral; for as in the Body, too rich Blood occasions many
Diseases, so in the Mind, the very Virtues themselves, if not carefully watched, may produce
very hurtful Maladies. Meekness therefore, and a long Habit of Submission, is often accompanied
by a want of Resolution, even where Resolution is commendable. To be all Softness, Gentleness
and Meekness, and at the same time to be steadily fixed in every Point 'tis improper to give
up, is peculiar to Clarissa herself, and a Disposition of Mind judiciously reserved by the
Author for his Heroine alone."

An old Gentleman who sat in the Corner, and often made wry Faces at the sudden Attack of Rheumatick
Pains, with which he was often afflicted, objected strongly to Mr. Harlowe's arbitrary Usage
of such a Wife, as being very unnatural.

"And methinks, it is very easy to imagine, Mr. Harlowe's Pains, and Mrs. Harlowe's tender Concern
for these Pains increasing together: her Attention to him, and earnest Endeavours to soften
and alleviate the Extremity of his Torments becoming all her Care; till, his Ill-temper daily
growing stronger by the Force of his bodily Disorders, he at last habituated himself to vent
it on the Person who most patiently submitted, tho' her Heart was most nearly touched and affected
by it. And I appeal to the common Experience of any Persons who have accustomed themselves
to make Observations on the Scenes before them, if they have not often seen heart-breaking
Harshness burst forth on those who strongest feel the Strokes, and yet submit to them without
complaining; and this practised even by Persons who would take it much amiss to be thought
peculiarly ill-natured."

The old Gentleman, without answering Miss Gibson, insisted on what he had said before; and
then turning to his Daughter, in a rough Voice, accompanied with a fierce Look, bid her not
sit so idly, but ring the Bell, that the Servant might get a Coach, for he would go home. The
young Lady, who was as submissive a Daughter as Mrs. Harlow was a Wife, immediately obeyed
his Commands, tho' it might be read in her Countenance, that she could have wished that he
would have injoined them in a milder Manner; on which her Father observed, that the Girl was
always out of Humour and sullen when she was employed. Indeed, Sir, said the young Lady, I
love to be honoured with your Commands; I was only afraid you was angry with me. A Tear stole
without her Consent from her Eyes, and at the same Time she looked at her Father with a supplicating,
instead of a sullen Countenance.

As soon as the Coach came, the old Gentleman, with great Roughness, commanded his Daughter
to attend him, and left us; and we could not help remarking, how much the Gentleman's Behaviour
had added Weight to the Force of his Criticism.

The next Objection was raised by Mr. Dellincourt, who found great Fault with the Liberties
you have taken with the English Language, and said, you had coined new Words, and printed others
as if you was writing a Spelling-book, instead of relating a Story. We were all silent for
a few Moments, and then Miss Gibson said;

"Indeed, Sir, I do not pretend to be any Judge of the Accuracy of Stile, but I beg to know,
if in the writing familiar Letters, many Liberties are not allowable, which in other kinds
of writing might perhaps be justly condemned: And as to the printing some of the Words with
Breaks between the Syllables, it certainly makes the Painting the stronger; however, I submit
this entirely to the Judgment of others. But supposing this to be a failing, surely it is a
trifling one, to censure a Book severely for, in which there are so many striking Beauties
to be found. But to illustrate my Thoughts on this Head, I will tell you a Story that is really
true.

"A Gentleman shewed a Friend of his a Picture of a favourite Horse, drawn by the celebrated
Mr. Wooten. The Horse was unexceptionably beautiful, and the Picture excellently drawn. His
Friend regarded it for some Time with great Attention: When the Gentleman (who was a Lover
of Pictures, and who delighted to share his Pleasures with others) earnestly asked his Friend's
Opinion of the Piece he was viewing; who, after much Consideration, with a significant Shrug
of his Shoulders, and a contemptuous Toss of his Hand, said, I don't like the Skirts of the
Saddle."

The Application of this Story was so very plain, that the whole Company were diverted with
it; and thus, Sir, I think I have sumed up all the Critisism I heard either against or in favour
of your Clarissa, on the Publication of the two first Volumes.

The next Scene of Criticism (if I may so call it) on Clarissa that I was present at, was on
the Publication of the two succeeding Volumes.

The same Company met, with the Addition only of one Gentleman, whom I shall call Bellario;
his known Taste and Impartiality made all those who wished Reason instead of Prejudice might
judge of the Subject before them, rejoice at his Presence. The Objections now arose so fast,
it was impossible to guess where they would end. Clarissa herself was a Prude--a Coquet--all
the Contradictions mentioned some Time ago in a printed Paper, with the Addition of many more,
were laid to her Charge. She was an undutiful Daughter--too strict in her Principles of Obedience
to such Parents--too fond of a Rake and a Libertine--her Heart was as impenitrable and unsusceptible
of Affection, as the hardest Marble. In short, the many contradictory Faults that she was at
once accused of, is almost incredible: So many, that those who had attended enough to her Character,
to have an Inclination to justify her, found it difficult to know where to begin to answer
such a complicated Charge. But after a short Silence, Miss Gibson with her usual Penetration, said;

"Whenever any Person is accused of a Variety of Faults, which are plainly impossible to dwell
in the same Mind, I am immediately convinced the Person so accused is innocent of them all.
A Prude cannot, by an observing Eye, be taken for a Coquet, nor a Coquet for a Prude, but a
good Woman may be called either, or both, according to the Dispositions of her resolved Censurers;
and hence I believe we may trace the Cause, why the Characters even of those Persons who do
not endeavour to wear any Disguise are so very liable to be mistaken; for Partiality or Prejudice
generally sit as Judges: If the former mount the Judgment-seat, how many different Terms do
we make use of to express that Goodness in another, which our own fluctuating Imaginations
only have erected? If the latter, how do we vary Expressions to paint that Wickedness which
we are resolve to prove inhabits the Mind we think proper to condemn?" "Nay, but (said Mr.
Dellincourt) how are we concerned either to justify or accuse Clarissa? we cannot be either
partial to, or prejudised against her." "I know not how it is, (replyed Miss Gibson) but those
who dread Censure, tho' Circumspection wait on every Step, will be censured, till there no
longer remains in the World any of those Dispositions that delight in inflicting that Punishment
on others they see they most fear. Now, tho' Clarissa was not so blameably fearful of Censure,
but that her first Care was to preserve the Innocence of her own Mind, and do no wrong; yet
it is plain, she would very gladly have avoided incurring, as well as deserving, Reproach;
and that she is treated like an intimate Acquaintance by all her Readers, the Author may thank
himself for. I dare say, the Authors of Cassandra, Clelia, with numberless others I could name,
were never in any Danger of having their Heroines thought on, or treated like human Creatures."

Bellario, who had hitherto been silent, said, "He thought Clarissa could not justly be accused
of any material Fault, but that of wanting Affection for her Lover; for that he was sure, a
Woman whose Mind was incapable of Love, could not be amiable, nor have any of those gentle
Qualities which chiefly adorn the female Character. And as to her whining after her Papa and
Mamma, who had used her so cruelly, (added he) I think 'tis contemptible in her."

"But, Sir, (said Miss Gibson) please only to consider, first, Clarissa is accused of want of
Love, and then in a Moment she is condemned for not being able suddenly to tear from her Bosom
an Affection that had been daily growing and improving from the Time of her Birth, and this
built on the greatest paternal Indulgence imaginable. Affections that have taken such deep
Root, are little Treasures hoarded up in the good Mind, and cannot be torn thence without causing
the strongest convulsive Pangs in the Heart, where they have been long nourished: And when
they are so very easily given up as you now, Sir, seem to contend for, I confess I am very
apt to suspect they have only been talked of by the Persons who can part with them with so
little Pain, either from Hypocrisy, or from another very obvious Cause, namely, the using Words
we are accustomed to hear, without so much as thinking of their Meaning. Such Hearts I think
may be much more properly compared to the Hardness of Marble, than could that of the gentle
Clarissa.

"There is in her Behaviour, I own, a good deal of apparent Indifference to Lovelace; but let
her Situation and his manner of treating her be considered, and I fancy the whole will be seen
in a different Light from what it may appear on the first View. She has confessed to Miss Howe,
that she could prefer him to all the Men she ever saw; and that Friend of her Heart, to whom
her very inmost Thoughts were laid open all along, pronounces her to be in Love with him. It
is not from Hypocrisy that she does not confess the Charge, but from the Reason Miss Howe gives,
when she says;

    I believe you did not intend Reserve to me, for two Reasons, I
    believe you did not; first, because you say you did not: Next,
    because you have not as yet been able to convince yourself how it
    is to be with you; and, persecuted as you are, how so to separate
    the Effects that spring from the two Causes (Persecution and Love)
    as to give to each its particular Due.

"That Clarissa positively did not intend to go off with Lovelace when she met him, to me is
very plain; nor could he have prevailed on her, had not the Terrors raised in her Mind, by
apprehended Murder, almost robbed her of her Senses, and hurried her away, not knowing what
she did. For the Truth of this, I appeal to that charming painted Scene, where the Reader's
Mind shares Clarissa's Terror, and is kept in one continued Tumult til.

"She was vexed to her soul afterwards to find she was tricked, as she calls it, out of herself,
when Lovelace, instead of comforting and assuring her Mind, begins such a Train of shufling
artful Tricks, as no one but Lovelace could have thought on: And altho' she did not know all
his Design, for if she had, she would certainly have left him, yet she sees enough of his crooked
ways, to be convinced that he acted ungenerously by her, because she was in his Power. Does
not Lovelace, in a Letter to Belford, writ in four Days after she was with him, say?

    And do I not see, that I shall want nothing but Patience, in order
    to have all Power with me? For what shall we say, if all these
    Complaints of a Character Wounded, these Declarations of increasing
    Regrets of meeting me, of Resentments never to be got over for my
    seducing her away, these angry Commands to leave her,--what shall we
    say, if all were to mean nothing but Matrimony?--And what if my
    forbearing to enter upon that Subject comes out to be the true Cause of
    her Petulance and Uneasiness.

 'She had often been sorry that the Poem of Henry and Emma
had not been long ago buried in Oblivion; for (continued she) it is one of those Things which,
by the Dress and Ornaments of fine Language and smooth Poetry, has imposed on Mankind so strong
a Fallacy, as to make a Character in itself most despicable, nay I may say most blameable,
generally thought worthy Admiration and Praise: For strip it of the dazzling Beauties of Poetry,
and thus fairly may the Story be told.

An old English Baron retired in his Decline of Life to his Country-seat, where one only Daughter
(left him by a Wife he fondly loved) was the Care, the Joy, the Comfort of his declining Years:
No sooner had the State of blooming Youth taken place of that of prattling Infancy, than she
became the Object of publick Admiration, and Lovers of all Degrees with Emulation strove to
gain the fair Emma's Favour; but as yet her Heart was free, and her Father's paternal tender
Indulgence never once endeavoured to force her Choice. At last the happy Henry in various Disguises
found the means to obtain her Favour, and she becomes passionately in Love with him: But not
content with this, he resolves on a Trial of her Constancy, and therefore tells her, that he
is a Murderer, must fly from Justice, and herd amongst the lowest and basest of Mankind; that
he despised her, and the fond Heart she had given him; a younger and fairer Nymph now engaging
his Pursuit, and that if she would follow him, she also must herd with Outlaws his Companions,
who like himself were fled from Justice; where Impiety, Blasphemy and Obscenity would be all
the Language she could hear.

Emma on this Trial, ignorant who Henry was, or what Brothel had last given him up, without
one Enquiry whether the Murder he confessed was not of the blackest Die, remorseless for all
the Agonies with which she must tear her Father's tender Bosom, resolves at all Events, as
Henry himself says,

    Name, Habit, Parents, Woman, left behind.

to follow him through the World; not admitted to share his Fate, but to be scorned and insulted
by him. Thus victoriously she stood her Trial. Henry turns out a great Man; consequently his
Wife is greatly admired; Success crowns all, and both Grandeur and Love join to reward her
supposed heroic Virtue.

But had the Poet thought proper, that Henry should have turned out the Murderer, the Vagabond,
the insolent and ungrateful Scorner of her Love he represented himself to be; had her Father's
Sorrow for her Fate shortned his miserable Days; had she been abandoned by the Wretch she had
so much Reason to expect the worst of Treatment from, and, between Rage, Despair, and a thousand
conflicting Passions, been led by a natural Gradation from one Vice to another, till she had
been lost in the most abandoned Profligacy; instead of being proposed for an Example, her Name
would have been only mentioned to deter others from the like rash Steps. That this was the
natural Consequence of her Actions is very apparent: Nor do I think from her Behaviour, that
Henry had the least Reason to be convinced that she would not leave him for the first Man who
would try to seduce her, provided the Colour of his Complexion suited her Fancy.

All the Company were very inclineable to yield up Emma's Cause, if Henry had indeed been a
Villain and a Murderer; only great Part of them were very apt to forget one Circumstance, namely,
that it was impossible for her to know, but that he was the Wretch he represented himself to
be; and Miss Gibson seemed to be much more inclined to compassionate her, if extreme Misery
had been her Fate, than was the Gentleman who first mentioned her as an Object of Admiration,
only because the Author of the Poem thought fit to reward her. Miss Gibson then addressing
herself to Bellario, said, 'Sir, you are a Father,--an indulgent Father,--would you have your
Daughter act in such a Manner?--Bellario honestly owned he would not. 'Why then, Sir, (replyed
she) please to consider a Moment, and you will see the Injustice of wishing another Man's Daughter
should act so.' Bellario ingenuously confessed, that when he read the Poem of Henry and Emma,
the Picture of his Mistress, and not that of his Daughter, was before his Eyes, and he would
have his Mistress of all Mankind love but him alone.----'I wonder not at that, Sir, (said Miss
Gibson) but then you would not be the Man Henry represented himself to be. Had Henry had any
Misfortunes by which his Heart had not been stained. I would have had Emma stood Henry's shocking
Tryal as Macduff in the Tragedy of Macbeth does that of Malcolm, and when he had proved himself
unworthy her least Affection; I think, in the Words of Macduff she might have said,

    ----Fare thee well,
    These Evils thou repeat'st upon thyself,
    Have banish'd me from JOY.----Oh! my Breast,
    Thy Hope ends here.

On such a Behaviour, I think the Reward she met with should have been founded, and such I believe
would have been the Behaviour of Clarissa in the like Circumstances.

'The Love that is not judicious, must be as uncertain as its capricious Foundation: But 'tis
one of the distinguishing Marks of Clarissa's Character, to watch her own Mind, that Prejudice
may not get Possession of it, nor her Imagination run away with her Judgment. With what a noble
Contempt does she treat the extravagant Offers Solmes makes her, at the Expence of Justice,
and cruelly leaving his Family to starve? But how very few People, like Clarissa, can poise
the Scales with an even Hand, where one Grain of Self is placed in either Scale?'

The Gentleman, who had at first started the Objection to Clarissa of her being incapable of
any strong Affection, now said, 'that he could not see any Proof of her Impartiality, in that
she could view the Actions of Solmes in the proper Light: He did not know whether she would
have argued in the same manner With regard to Lovelace'. Miss Gibson said, 'Do you speak this,
Sir, as a Proof of the Justice of your first Objection to Clarissa, that her Heart was as impenetrable
as Marble; is it reasonable she should be condemned both ways?' The Gentleman look'd very grave
for a Moment, and then said, he was sure she had no Affections in her, notwithstand what he
had now said.

Mr. Johnson on this, told the following Story.

"I remember (said he) I went some time ago with Mr. Tonson to a celebrated Painter's, to see
a Picture he had drawn of a Gentleman we were both intimately acquainted with; the Resemblance
was very strong; we were much pleased with the Picture, even to the very Drapery; the Coat
was a fine Crimson Cloth, but Mr. Tonson, at first View, took it for Velvet; he was soon convinced
of his Mistake, but yet could never since mention the Picture, without talking of the Velvet
Coat; and when I have bid him remember it was Cloth, he has always acknowledged it, and said,
it's very true Sir; And yet such a strong Impression had his first Idea of it made in his Mind,
that in two Minutes he could talk again of the Velvet Coat, with as much Ease as if he had
been perfectly ignorant of his Mistake."

A strong Objection was raised to Mr. Lovelace's being so long without any Attempt on the Lady's
Honour, when she was under the same Roof with him, and so much in his Power. Mr. Johnson said
he thought Mr. Belford had given a good Reason for this Delay in a Letter to Lovelace, where
he says,

    Thou too a Man born for Intrigue, full of Invention, intrepid,
    remorseless, able patiently to watch for the Opportunity, not
    flurried, as most Men, by Gusts of violent Passion, which often nip
    a Project in the Bud, and make the Snail, which was just putting
    out its Horns to meet the Inviter, withdraw into its Shell.

So that it seems to be a Maxim, amongst Lovelace and his Club of Rakes, not to destroy their
own Schemes by a too precipitate Pursuit; and Lovelace gives yet a stronger Reason for it in
the following Words.

    O Virtue, Virtue, says he, what is there in thee, that can thus
    affect the Heart of such a Man as me against my Will!--Whence these
    involuntary Tremors, and fear of giving mortal Offence! What art
    thou that, acting in the Breast of a feeble Woman, canst strike so
    much awe into a Spirit so intrepid which never before, no, not in
    my first Attempt, young as I then was, and frighted at my own
    Boldness (till I found myself forgiven,) had such an Effect on
    me.

But Quotations from Lovelace's Words to this Purpose, and that he was resolved to be slow in
order to be sure, would be endless.

This, I think, was the last Objection raised; only Bellario said, that the Report that the
Catastrophy was to be unhappy had made a deep Impression on him; for that he could not avoid
thinking that, if it was true, it must be a great Error, and destroy all the Pleasure a good-natur'd
Reader might already have received: However, he said, he would keep his Word in not absolutely
giving his Judgment till he saw the Conclusion.

And thus ended the second Scene of Criticism on Clarissa; only, as we went down Stairs, a Lady,
who had not spoke one Word the whole Evening, mutter'd out a strong Dislike, that the agreeable
Mr. Lovelace should not become a Husband.

And now, in the Month of December, appears the long expected, much wished for Conclusion of
Clarissa's Story.

The Company we have already mentioned being again assembled, the Lady who had before grieved
that the agreeable Mr. Lovelace should not become a Husband, now lamented that Miss Howe should
be married to so insipid a Man (that was the Epithet she chose for him) as Mr. Hickman. This
passed some little time without any Answer. Miss Gibson was silent; and I saw by her Looks
that she thought there was some Weight in her Objection. At last an old Lady, who had three
Daughters marriagable, said, she wondered to hear Mr. Hickman called insipid; for she thought
there could be no Reason for giving him that Appellation, unless young Women would confess
what she should be very sorry to hear them confess, namely, that, in their Opinion, Sobriety
intitles a Man to the Character of Insipidity. Pray remember, continued the Lady, that there
is no Ridicule cast upon Mr. Hickman throughout the whole Story, but by Lovelace and Miss Howe.
The former lov'd Ridicule so well, that he could make Objects of it, by the Help of his gay
Imagination, even where he found none: Besides, he hated any Man should have a fine Woman but
himself; for, in his Opinion, he alone deserved them. And I think Miss Howe is very censurable
for the Liberties she takes with a worthy Man, whom also it is plain she intends to make her
Husband.

Miss Gibson agreed in censuring Miss Howe for the Liberties she takes with him; but at the
same time said, she thought even his bearing that Usage did lower his Character. Now you see,
replied the Lady, how you are taken in; that you can condemn Miss Howe for her Contempt of
Mr. Hickman, and yet at the same time let the lively Strokes that fall from her Pen have their
full force against the abused worthy Man. Yet Miss Howe herself owns, as early as the second
Volume, that Mr. Hickman is humane, benevolent, generous,--No Fox-hunter--No Gamester--That
he is sober, modest, and virtuous; and has Qualities that Mothers would be fond of in a Husband
for their Daughters; and for which, perhaps, their Daughters would be the happier, could they
judge as well for themselves as Experience may teach them to judge for their future Daughters.
In other Places he is represented as charitable, considerate to Inferiors, so obliging and
respectful to his Mother-in-law, that she leaves him at her Death, in Acknowledgment of it,
all that was in her Power: And Miss Howe owns he never disobliged her by Word or Look. What
then is the Objection to Mr. Hickman? Why truly, he has not Lovelace's fine Person!--Lovelace's
fine Address!--Lovelace's impetuous Spirit; and yet he has shewn even Lovelace, that he wants
not Courage. He is plain in his Dress!--His Gait shews him not to be so debonnaire in dancing
a Minuit as Lovelace.--But, indeed, I am afraid whoever prefers a Lovelace to a Hickman, will
wish all her life-time she could have sooner found out, that tho' Lovelace was the best Partner
at a Ball; yet, when a Companion for Life was to be chose, that Mr. Hickman's Goodness of Heart
rendered him in all respects more essential to Happiness; much more eligible than all the gay,
fluttering, and parading Spirit of a Lovelace could possibly have done.

Nay, Madam, says Miss Gibson, I do not dispute Mr. Hickman's being preferable for a Husband
to Mr. Lovelace; the Heart is certainly the first thing to be considered in a Man to whose
Government a Woman resigns herself; but I should not chuse either Lovelace or Hickman. I must
confess I should desire Humour and Spirit in a Man. A married Life, tho' it cannot be said
to be miserable with an honest Husband; yet it must be very dull, when a Man has not the Power
of diversifying his Ideas enough to display trifling Incidents in various Lights; and 'tis
impossible where this is wanting, but that a Man and his Wife must often depend on other Company
to keep them from sinking into Insipidity. And for my part, I cannot paint to myself any thing
more disagreeable, than to sit with a Husband and wish some-body would come in and relieve
us from one another's Dulness. Trifles, Madam, become strong Entertainments to sprightly Minds!--

Ah! Miss Gibson, replied the Lady, in every Word you speak, you prove how necessary the Author's
Moral is to be strongly inculcated; when even your serious and thoughtful Turn of Mind will
not suffer you to see through the Glare of what you call Humour and Spirit with that Clearness
which would enable you to distinguish how very seldom that Humour and Spirit is bestowed on
a Wife. Mr. Hickman's whole Mind being at Home, would enliven him into a chearful Companion
with his Wife; whilst a Lovelace's Mind, engaged on foreign Objects, would often make him fall
into Peevishness and Ill-humour, instead of this so much dreaded Insipidity.

Indeed, Madam, said Miss Gibson, I don't plead for Mr. Lovelace; for I detest him of all the
Men I ever read of.

That is true, replied the Lady; but that is because you have read of him, and know the Villanies
he was capable of. But yet, I think, you have plainly proved, if a Lovelace and a Hickman contended
for your Favour, which would have the best Chance of succeeding.

Miss Gibson blushed, and was silent; when a sprightly Girl, of about Sixteen, said, She loved
Mr. Hickman very much; he was a good, and a gentle-hearted Man--But indeed she should not like
him for her Husband.

The Gentlemen, during this Debate, had all sat silent; but they often smiled to see how few
Advocates Mr. Hickman was likely to have amongst the Ladies.

At last Bellario said, If I had not thought so before, I should now be convinced by this Conversation,
how judicious the Author of Clarissa was in setting forth so very strongly as he does, the
Necessity of Sobriety and Goodness in a Husband, in order to render a married State happy.
For you have shown clearly, Ladies, how difficult it is for a Man to be esteemed by you who
has those Qualities, since I can see no one Objection to Mr. Hickman, but that he has not that
Gaiety of Disposition which from a vast Flow of animal Spirits, without Restraint or Curb from
either Principles of Religion or Good-nature, shines forth in Lovelace's wild Fancies. And
this Man you find such a Reluctance to speak well of; tho' a reforming Belford esteems; Colonel
Morden highly values him; and says, he is respected by all the World!--And a Clarissa for ever
acknowledges his Merit.--And, in one of the last Actions of her Life, praises him as he deserves
to be praised. And earnestly recommends it to her best and dear Friend, to give both her Hand
and Heart to so worthy a Man. The steady Principles of Mr. Hickman was a firm Basis to depend
on, for Protection and good Usage.

To this Letter, continued Bellario, and numerous other Places in the Book, would I refer all
those, if any such there are, who yet doubt her being capable of Love.

Clarissa seems indeed, as Colonel Morden says, (added the now-admiring Bellario) to have been,
as much as Mortal could be, LOVE ITSELF.

Miss Gibson was highly delighted with what Bellario said, and added to it, That she thought
Clarissa's frankness of Heart was very apparent, from the manner in which she had treated those
Gentlemen her Heart had obliged her to refuse, and from the generous Advice she in so many
Places gives Miss Howe, in relation to her Treatment of Mr. Hickman: And pray, Sir, continued
Miss Gibson, pardon my asking you one Question more, namely; whether you are not now satisfied
with the Conduct of the Author in the Management of his whole Story?

Bellario answered, That he was not only satisfied with it, but highly applauded all the material
Parts of it; that the various distressful Situations in which you had placed your Heroine,
were noble beyond Expression; that these three last Volumes contained many Scenes, each singly
arising to as high a Tragedy as can possibly be wrote; that the Tears you had drawn from his
Eyes were such Tears as flow'd from a Heart at once filled with Admiration and Compassion,
and labouring under Sensations too strong for any Utterance in Words; and that for the Sake
of Clarissa, he would never form any Judgment of a Work again till the whole was lain before
him. When the gross of a were behind him, and have kya byway opened only before i, i could not help
give foot, as he dashed across the big beneath any subdivision of king-El. A declivity and a enclosure
were never arching. So, since we suit irrigate from shrubbery to instantly, and not from Atares
to Tate and dell Principe, weeping the escort of vegetation, and own
regulator, had i extend both only love how the lavender by ugly house
because suited through my veins were like a purdah at the butchers. So,
that i determine not how atares i would not have fix the whose flora
had not be the cliff long start at whose sir, where my delightful
Cannot of the path, and dart back for a Iodine-131 met my wondering
friend.

Having felt all our humor, i felt that better chase for a mound to this celebrity who was the probability
of our rein. About two knot could see from whose owner, we strike the path of a berm, the haste
of feet in jaunt, tantalizingly whose battalion am him reached the
affected and close cotton, sobered by the course which was hemmed
in the happening.

Liquid and the digest, we rise a code for the ambulance till him near a hundred of Havana, along whose
turned mr. I excel it thought at the deep, and instead stand within much rake of these harmony,
whence the magnificent and arabian Derivation whoever dribble slowly to the unpatterned. A

analyze the eyes to cognize their quality, to the satanic me have abruptly in the happening
of the waters was gifted with the "side of reflections," and, in mettlesome, would reply
best to me in a, if i thought to endure to character that him.
 Nay, Sir, said Bellario, 'I cannot see how she can be said to cant;
for her religious Reflections are neither nonsensical or affected, but such as naturally arise
from a pious Mind in her several Situations; and if you are a Christian, Sir, I am sure you
cannot, on Consideration, dislike that Part of her Character.' Mr. Dellincourt said, 'Yes,
he was a Christian, and he did not dislike some of her Reflections, at least when she was near
Death; but he thought she talked too much of Religion at the Beginning; for it was unnatural
for a young Beauty to have such grave Thoughts.' Bellario smiled and said,

'You put me in mind, Sir, of Dame Quickly, who when Sir John Falstaff, in his Illness, calls
upon God, told him, to comfort him, she hoped there was no Occasion yet to think of any such
Matters; supposing, that to think of God, except he was quite dying, was very unnecessary.
And, indeed, I have often known a professed Christian excuse introducing a Word of Religion
into Company, as if it would be indecent to mention any such matters; but as to Clarissa, I
think the Principles she had imbibed from her Infancy from the good and pious Mrs. Norton,
and which were afterwards strengthned by her Conversation with Doctor Lewin, renders it very
natural for her to be early and steadily religious.' Mr. Dellincourt made no Answer, but dropped
his Objection; and Mr. Barker said, 'that he thought there was one great Fault in the Conduct
of your Story; and that was, the Indelicacy of making Clarissa seek Lovelace after the Outrage;
for that he was strongly of Opinion, that she had better have escaped from Mrs. Sinclair's
and have avoided the Sight of Lovelace.' 'Indeed, Sir, said Miss Gibson, I believe she would
have been very thankful for your Advice, if you could at the same time have found out any Expedient
to have put it in Execution; but if you will please to recollect, you may remember the Difficulty
she had to escape once before, even when she was not suspected; and Lovelace now could have
no manner of doubt, but that she would fly that House, if not prevented, as soon as her Strength
would permit her to leave her Bed.

As to the Indelicacy of Clarissa's seeking Lovelace, said Bellario, 'I confess I do not see
it; however, I will leave that matter to be decided by the Ladies', who all agreed, that they
thought it no Breach of the strictest Modesty to declare it was their Opinion, that the whole
Scene, as it now stands, is what it should be, and would have admited of no Alteration, but
for the worse; that the picturesque Manner in which a young Woman, without Fear or Confusion,
beholds the Man who dared imagine his Guilt could baffle all her Resolutions, and sink her
Soul to Cowardice, most beautifully displays the Power of conscious Innocence; and, on the
other hand, that the confused Mind, the flattering Speech, unavoidable even by a Lovelace when
his guilty Soul was awed by the Presence of an Object injured beyond the Power of Reparation,
displays the Deformity of Wickedness in all its Force. In short, this Scene was allowed to
be Virtue's Triumph, and Clarissa's Conduct to be a direct Opposition to that of all those
whining Women, who blubber out an humble Petition to be joined for Life to the Men who have
betrayed them.

Had not Clarissa seen Lovelace, said Miss Gibson, her Triumph could never have been so compleat;
and as I think the Impossibility of her Escape at that time, from Mrs. Sinclair's, is very
apparent, had she not sought him, the true Lovers of Clarissa must have mourned the Loss of
seeing her Behaviour in such an uncommon Situation.

Bellario gave these Sentiments a Sanction by his Approbation, and the rest of the Company either
concurr'd with his Opinion, or at least did not contradict him; and the next Day Miss Gibson
received the following Letter from Bellario.

~MADAM~,

You seem'd so pleased last Night with my Conversion, if I may be allowed the Expression, to
your Favourite Clarissa, that I could not seek any Repose till I had thrown together my Thoughts
on that Head, in order to address them to you; nor am I ashamed to confess, that the Author's
Design is more noble, and his Execution of it much happier, than I even suspected till I had
seen the whole.

In a Series of familiar Letters to relate a compleat Story, where there is such a Variety of
Characters, every one conducing to the forming the necessary Incidents to the Completion of
that Story, is a Method so intirely new, so much an Original manner of Writing, that the Author
seems to have a Right to make his own Laws; the painting Nature is indeed his Aim, but the
Vehicle by which he conveys his lively Portraits to the Mind is so much his own Invention,
that he may guide and direct it according to his own Will and Pleasure. Aristotle drew his
Rules of Epic Poetry from Homer, and not Homer from Aristotle; tho' had they been Cotemporaries,
perhaps that had been a Point much disputed.

As to the Length of the Story, I fancy that Complaint arises from the great Earnestness the
Characters inspire the Reader with to know the Event; and on a second Reading may vanish. Clarissa
is not intended as a Dramatic, but as a real Picture of human Life, where Story can move but
slowly, where the Characters must open by degrees, and the Reader's own Judgment form them
from different Parts, as they display themselves according to the Incidents that arise. As
for Example; the Behaviour of Lovelace to his Rosebud must strike every one, at first View,
with Admiration and Esteem for him; but when his Character comes to blaze in its full Light,
it is very apparent that his Pride preserved his Rosebud, as well as it destroyed Clarissa;
like Milton's Satan, he could for a Time cloath himself like an Angel of Light, even to the
Deception of Uriel.

Proud Spirits, such as Satan's and Lovelace's, require Objects of their Envy, as Food for their
Malice, to compleat their Triumph and applaud their own Wickedness. From this Incident of the
Rosebud, and the subsequent Behaviour of Lovelace, arises a Moral which can never be too often
inculcated; namely, that Pride has the Art of putting on the Mask of Virtue in so many Forms,
that we must judge of a Man upon the whole, and not from any one single Action.

A celebrated French Critick says, that

'An indifferent Wit may form a vast Design in his Imagination; but it must be an EXTRAORDINARY
GENIUS that can work his Design, and fashion it according to Justness and Proportion: For 'tis
necessary that the same Spirit reign throughout; that all contribute to the same End; and that
all the Parts bear a secret Relation to each other; all depend on this Relation and Alliance.'

Let the nicest Critick examine the Story of Clarissa, and see if in any Point it fails of coming
up exactly to the before-mentioned Rule. The Author had all Nature before him, and he has beautifully
made use of every Labyrinth, in the several Minds of his Characters, to lead him to his purposed
End.

The Obstinacy of old Harlowe, who never gave up a Point, unaccustomed to Contradiction, and
mad with the Thoughts of his own Authority; the Pride of the two old Batchelors, who had lived
single, in order to aggrandize their Family; the overbearing impetuous James Harlowe's Envy,
arising from Ambition; the two-fold Envy of Arabella Harlowe, springing from Rivalship in general
Admiration, as well as in particular liking; the former more rough, the latter more sly, tho'
full as keen in her Reproaches; the constant Submission of Mrs. Harlowe, and the mad Vanity
of Lovelace, all conspire to the grand End of distressing and destroying the poor Clarissa;
whose Misfortune it was to be placed amongst a Set of Wretches, who were every one following
the Bent of their own peculiar Madness, without any Consideration for the innocent Victim who
was to fall a Sacrifice to their ungovernable Passions. And here I must observe, how artfully
the Author has conducted the opening of his different Characters, as they became more interested
in his Story. The Correspondence between Miss Howe and Clarissa, with some characteristical
Letters of each of the Harlowes, as these were then his principal Actors, chiefly compose the
two first Volumes.

In the third, fourth and fifth Volumes, Lovelace comes prancing before the Reader's Eye; gives
an unrestrained Loose to his uncurbed Imagination, and ripens into full-blown Baseness that
Blackness of Mind, which had hitherto only shot forth in Buds but barely visible. The strong
and lively Pen of Lovelace was most proper to relate the most active Scenes. But when his mischievous
Heart and plotting Head had left him no farther use for his wild Fancies, than to rave and
curse his own Folly, Belford takes up the Pen, and carries on the Story; and in the sixth and
seventh Volumes, Colonel Morden (who has hitherto made but a small Appearance) is brought upon
the Stage, and his Character, as he is to be the Instrument of the Death of Lovelace, is as
strongly painted, and as necessary to the Completion of the Story, as are any of the others.
It is astonishing to me how much the different Stile of each Writer is in every Particular
preserved; indeed so characteristically preserved, that when I read Clarissa's Letters, where
every Line speaks the considerate and the pious Mind, I could almost think the Author had studied
nothing but her Character. When Miss Howe's lively Vein and flowing Wit entertains me, She
appears to have been the principal Person in his Thoughts. When Mrs. Harlowe writes, her broken
half-utter'd Sentences are so many Pictures of the broken timorous Spirit of Meekness tyrannised
over, that dictates to her Pen. When Mr. Harlowe condescends to sign his much valued Name,
the dictatorial Spirit of an indulged tyrannic Disposition indites every arbitrary Command.
When John Harlowe writes, the Desire of proving himself of Consequence from his Fortune, and
being infected with the Idea of his Niece's Disobedience, (a Word which continually resounded
through his Family) plainly appear to be the only two Causes that make him insist on her Compliance.
In Anthony Harlowe's Roughness and Reproaches, 'The Sea prosper'd Gentleman, (as Clarissa says)
not used to any but elemental Controul, and even ready to buffet that, blusters as violently
as the Winds he was accustomed to be angry at.' In James Harlowe's Letters, we see how the
Mind infected with the complicated Distemper of Envy, Insolence and Malice, can blot the fair
Paper, and poison it with its Venom. In Arabella Harlowe, the sly Insinuations of feminine
Envy break forth in every taunting Word, and she could "speak Daggers, tho' she dared not use
them." But, to imitate our Author, in turning suddenly from this detestable Picture, how does
every Line of the good Mrs. Norton shew us a Mind inured to, and patiently submitting to Adversity,
looking on Contempt as the unavoidable Consequence of Poverty, and fixed in a firm and pious
Resolution of going through all the Vicissitudes of this transitory Life without repining.

Nor does the Author fail more in the preserving the characteristical Difference of Stile in
the Writings of Mowbray, Belford and Lovelace.

Mowbray, tho' he writes but two Letters in the whole, yet do those two so strongly fix his
Character, that every Reader may see of what Consequence he made himself to Society; namely,
to act the blustring Part in a Club of Rakes, to fill a Seat at the Table, and assist in keeping
up the Roar and Noise necessary to make the Life of such Assemblies. 

We had both performd our Environment to be of Satisfaction; i catch him about Laws, and i state
him chuse he shou, till as i know who he was; for i made him think i know him would not, idea it
was my Husband, but it happened today late contrary. By sensing over-auscultation, d he have
solicited her has firmly for her last Favours, which she consent to; and being decide to better
i this the accomplishing my own Ambition, having o'er-learn'em do their appointment, it, as i
call'd Chambermaid down (for she believe it was that is not the totally courted) and she send

so that i knew of d she ignore of her being afield, Husband has really silent similarly, i

with compliance from me which he did not thus easy anticipate; and i must not utterly, that i
had not believe till Case savor any delights of Passion: for d, that i was really chuse much entreaty'd.
 His impetuous Will, unrestrained from his Infancy, as he himself complains,
by his Mother, and long accustomed to bear down all before it, destroys the Gentleman, and
equally every other amiable Qualification: For tho' a Knowledge of the Customs of the World
may make a Man in Company, where he stays but a little while, appear polite; yet when that
Man indulges himself in gratifying continually his own wild Humour, those who are intimate
with him, must often have Cause to complain of his Unpoliteness; as Clarissa does of Lovelace.
And by such Complaints of Clarissa, I think it is very apparent, that the Author designed Lovelace
should be unpolite, notwithstanding his Station, in order to prove that indulged overbearing
Passions will trample under Foot every Bar that would stop them in their raging Course. But
now I am upon the Subject of the different Stiles in Clarissa, I must observe how strictly
the Author has kept up in all the Writings of his Rakes to what he says of Lovelace in his Preface.

There is one Thing has almost astonished me in the Criticisms I have heard on Clarissa's Character;
namely, that they are in a Manner a Counterpart to the Reproaches cast on her in her Lifetime.

She has been called perverse and obstinate by many of her Readers; James Harlowe called her
so before them. Some say she was romantic; so said Bella; disobedient; all the Harlowes agree
in that; a Prude; so said Salley Martin; had a Mind incapable of Love; Mr. Lovelace's Accusation;
for he must found his Brutality on some Shadow of a Pretence, tho' he confesses at last it
was but a Shadow, for that he knew the contrary the whole Time. Others say, she was artful
and cunning, had the Talent only to move the Passions; the haughty Brother and spiteful Sister's
Plea to banish her from her Parents Presence. I verily think I have not heard Clarissa condemned
for any one Fault, but the Author has made some of the Harlowes, or some of Mrs. Sinclair's
Family accuse her of it before.

As I have, as concisely as I could, pointed out the Difference in the chief Characters of Clarissa,
all necessary to the same End; in the same Manner could I go through the Scenes all as essentially
different, and rising in due Proportion one after another, till all the vast Building centers
in the pointed View of the Author's grand Design. Of all the lively well-painted Scenes in
the four first Volumes, and all those in the fifth previous to the Night before the Outrage,
mention but any of the most trifling Circumstances, such as Clarissa's torn Rufles, and Remembrance
places her before us in all the Agonies of the strongest Distress; insulted over by the vilest
of Women, and prostrate on her Knees imploring Mercy at the Feet of her Destroyer. Her Madness
equals, (I had almost said exceeds) any Thing of the Kind that ever was written: That hitherto
so peculiar Beauty in King Lear, of preserving the Character even in Madness, appears strongly
in Clarissa: the same self-accusing Spirit, the same humble Heart, the same pious Mind breathes
in her scattered Scrapes of Paper in the midst of her Frenzy; and the Irregularity and sudden
broken Starts of her Expressions alone can prove that her Senses are disordered. Her Letter
to Lovelace, where, even in Madness, galling Reproach drops not from her Pen, and which contains
only Supplications that she may not be farther persecuted, speaks the very Soul of Clarissa,
and by the Author of her Story could have been wrote for no one but herself. Whoever can read
her earnest Request to Lovelace, that she may not be exposed in a public Mad-house, on the
Consideration that it might injure him, without being overwhelmed in Tears, I am certain has
not in himself the Concord of sweet Sounds, and, must, as Shakespear says, be fit for Treasons,
Stratagems and Spoils. And to close at once, all I will say of the Author's Conduct in regard
to the managing (what seems most unmanageable) the Mind even when overcome by Madness, he has
no where made a stronger Contrast between Clarissa and Lovelace, or kept the Characters more
distinct than in their Madness. I have already mentioned how much Clarissa's Thoughts in her
Frenzy apparently flow from the same Channel, tho' more disturbed and less clear than when
her uninterrupted Reason kept on its steady Course. Lovelace's Character is not less preserved:
his Pen or Tongue indeed seldom uttered the Words of Reason, but the same overbearing Passions,
the same Pride of Heart that had accustomed him to strut in his fancy'd Superiority, makes
him condemn all the World but himself; and rave that Bedlam might be enlarged, imagining, that
a general Madness had seized Mankind, and he alone was exempt from the dreadful Catastrophy.

In the Penknife Scene Clarissa is firmly brave; her Soul abhorred Self-murder, nor would she,
as she told Miss Howe, willingly like a Coward quit her Post; but in this Case, could she not
have awed Lovelace into Distance, tho' her Hand had pointed the Knife, yet might he properly
have been said to have struck the Blow. The picturesque Attitude of all present, when Clarissa
suddenly cries out, 'God's Eye is upon us' has an Effect upon the Mind that can only be felt;
and that it would be a weak and vain Effort for Language to attempt to utter.

In the Prison Scene Clarissa exerts a different kind of Bravery. Insult and Distress, Cold
and Hardships, to what she was accustomed to, she bears almost in silence; and by her Suffering
without repining, without Fear of any thing but Lovelace, she is the strongest Proof of what
Shakespear says, that

    ----where the greater Malady is fixt
    The Lesser is scarce felt----

And let those who have accused Clarissa of having a suspicious Temper, from her being apt to
suspect Lovelace, here confess, that it must be the Person's Fault at whom her Suspicion is
level'd, when she wants that Companion of a great Mind, a generous Confidence; for how soon
does Belford's honest Intentions breaking forth in the Manner in which he addresses her, make
her rely on the known Friend of her Destroyer, and the publick Companion of all his Rakeries.
Nor can I here pass by in perfect Silence, the noble Simplicity with which Clarissa sums up
her Story to Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick; for I think 'tis the strongest Pattern that can be
imagined of that Simplicity which strikes to the Heart, and melts the Soul with all the softer
Passions.

In Colonel Morden's Account of the conveying the lifeless Remains of the Divine Clarissa to
be interred in the Vault of her Ancestors, his very Words keep solemn Pace with the Herse which
incloses her once animated, now lifeless, Form. Step by Step we still attend her; turn with
the Horses as they take the Bye-road to Harlow-place; start with the wretched, guilty Family,
at the first Stroke of the mournful tolling Bell; are fixed in Amazement with the lumbering
heavy Noise of the Herse up the paved inner Court-yard: But when the Servant comes in to acquaint
the Family with its Arrival, and we read this Line, He spoke not, he could not speak; he looked,
he bowed, and withdrew, we catch the Servant's silent Grief; our Words are choaked, and our
Sensations grow too strong for Utterance. The awful Respect paid to Clarissa's Memory by those
Persons, who generally both rejoice and mourn in Noise and Clamour, is inimitably beautiful.
But even in this solemn Scene the Author has not forgot the Characters of the principal Actors
in it: For the barbarous Wretches who could drive Clarissa from her native Home, and by their
Cruelty hurl her to Destruction, could not shed Tears for her Loss, without mingled Bitterness,
and sharp-cutting Recriminations on each other; every one striving to rid themselves of the
painful Load, and to throw it doubly on their former Companions in Guilt. The Mother only,
as she was the least guilty, deplores the heavy Loss with soft melting Tears, and lets Self-accusations
flow from her trembling Lips.

On the Arrival of Miss Howe, we turn from the slow moving Herse, to the rapid Chariot-wheels
that fly to bring the warm Friend, all glowing with the most poignant lively Grief, to mourn
her lost Clarissa. Here again the Description equals the noble Subject. Miss Howe, at the first
striking Sight of Clarissa in her Coffin, could only by frantic Actions express the labouring
Anguish that perturbed her Breast. And we accompany her in Horror, when she first impatiently
pushes aside the Coffin Lid. In short, we sigh, we rave, and we weep with her. VII. Letter
74. Page 292. in Clarissa.

But it would be endless to mention all the moving tragic Scenes, that are now crouding into
my Mind, in Clarissa; all judiciously interspersed with Scenes of comic Humour; such as the
Behaviour of Lovelace at the Ball; the Meeting between him and Mr. Hickman; Lovelace's Description
of what he calls his Tryal before Lord M--and the Ladies; with some others equally calculated
to relieve the Mind from fixing too long on mournful melancholy Ideas.

Finely has the Author of Clarissa set forth what is true, and what is false Honour.

True and false Friendship was never more beautifully displayed than in this Work; the firm,
the steady Flame that burns in the fixed Affection between Clarissa and Miss Howe, which, in
Clarissa's Words, has Virtue for its Base, is both well described and accounted for by Colonel
Morden; and that Chaff and Stubble, as she well calls it, that has not Virtue for its Base,
is inimitably painted by Belford, in his Account of Mowbray's Behaviour to the dying Belton.
She was to revenge on Lovelace his Miss Betterton, his French Devotee, his French Countess,
the whole Hecatomb which he boasts that he had in different Climes sacrificed to his Nemesis,
and all this by the natural Effects of his own vile Actions, and her honest noble Simplicity;
whilst she steadily pursues the bright Path of Innocence, and proposes to herself no other
End, no not even in Thought, but to preserve untainted her spotless Mind, and diffuse Happiness
to all around her.

I confess I was against the Story's ending unhappily, till I saw the Conclusion; but I now
think the different Deaths of the many Persons (for in this Point also the Difference is as
essentially preserved, as in the Characters or Scenes) who fall in the winding up the Catastrophy
in the seventh Volume, produce as noble a Moral as can be invented by the Wit of Man.

The broken Spirit, the dejected Heart that pursue poor Belton through his last Stage of Life
(brought on by a lingering Illness, and ill Usage from an artful Woman to whom Vice had attached
him, and increased by his Soul's being startled and awaked from that thoughtless Lethargy in
which Vice had so long lulled him) naturally break forth in those fearful Tremors, those agonizing
pannic Terrors of the Mind, which follow him to the End, and make a strong and lively Picture
of the Terrors of Death first thought on, when Life was flying, and could no longer supply
the flowing Blood and vital Heat that animates the mortal Frame.

Mrs. Sinclair's Death is very different; the Suddenness of her Departure had not given Time
for a regular Decay of her Strength, and the same animal Spirits which used to support her
in the noisy Roar of a profligate Life, now like so many Vultures preyed on her own Bosom,
and assisted to express the dreadful Horrors of an unexpected Death.

Lovelace, when he comes to die, is full of Rage and Disappointment; his uncontrouled Spirit,
unused to be baffled, cannot quietly submit to the great and universal Conqueror Death himself.
On his Death-bed he is a lively Picture of the End of that worldly Wisdom which is Foolishness
with God. His strong Imagination that assisted him to form and carry on those cunning Plots
which he pursued to his own Destruction, now assisted his Conscience to torment his Soul, and
set before his Eyes the injured Innocent who would have contributed to the utmost of her Power
that he might have spent all his Days in Peace and Joy. In short, he fluttered like a gay Butterfly
in the Sunshine of Prosperity; he wandered from the Path that leads to Happiness: In the Bloom
of Youth he fell a Sacrifice to his own Folly: his Life was a Life of Violence, and his Death
was a Death of Rage.

Whilst the gentle Clarissa's Death is the natural Consequence of her innocent Life; her calm
and prepared Spirit, like a soft smooth Stream, flows gently on, till it slides from her Misfortunes,
and she leaves the World free from Fear, and animated only by a lively Hope.

She wished her closing Scene might be happy. She had her Wish, (says the Author in his Postscript)
it was happy.

Nothing ever made so strong a Contrast as the Deaths of Lovelace and Clarissa. Wild was the
Life of Lovelace, rapid was his Death; gentle was Clarissa's Life, softly flowed her latest
Hours; the very Word Death seems too harsh to describe her leaving Life, and her last Breath
was like the soft playing of a western Breeze, all calm! all Peace! all Quiet!

The true Difference between the Virtuous and the Vicious lies in the Mind, where the Author
of Clarissa has placed it; Lovelace says well, when he views the persecuted Clarissa a-sleep.

    'See the Difference in our Cases; she the charming Injured can sweetly
    sleep, whilst the varlet Injurer cannot close his Eyes, and has been
    trying to no purpose the whole Night to divert his Melancholy, and to
    fly from himself.'

Rightly I think in the Author's Postscript is it observed, that what is called poetical Justice
is chimerical, or rather anti-providential Justice; for God makes his Sun to shine alike on
the Just and the Unjust. Why then should Man invent a kind of imaginary Justice, making the
common Accidents of Life turn out favourable to the Virtuous only? Vain would be the Comforts
spoken to the Virtuous in Affliction, in the sacred Writings, if Affliction could not be their Lot.

But the Author of Clarissa has in his Postscript quoted such undoubted Authorities, and given
so many Reasons on the Christian System for his Catastrophy, that to say more on that Head
would be but repeating his Words. The Variety of Punishments also of those guilty Persons in
this Work who do not die, and the Rewards of those who are innocent, I could go through; had
not that Postscript, and the Conclusion supposed to be writ by Mr. Belford, already done it
to my Hands. Only one thing I must say, that I don't believe the most revengeful Person upon
Earth could wish their worst Enemy in a more deplorable Situation, than if Lovelace in his
Frenzy, in that charming picturesque Scene, where he is riding between Uxbridge and London,
when his impatient Spirit is in suspence; and also when he hears of Clarissa's Death.

Thus have I just hinted at the Heads of the Characters, the Difference of the chief Scenes,
and the Variety of the several Deaths, all the natural Consequences of the several Lives, and
productive of the designed noble Moral in Clarissa; and I think it may be fairly and impartially
said, The Web is wove so strongly, every Part so much depending on and assisting each other,
that to divide any of them, would be to destroy the whole.

If what I have here said can be any Amusement to you, as it concerns your favourite Clarissa,
my End will be answered. I am,

                    Miss GIBSON to BELLARIO.

~SIR,~

Your Good-nature in sending me your Thoughts on Clarissa, with a Design to give me Pleasure,
I assure you is not thrown away; may you have equal Success in every generous Purpose that
fills your Heart, and greater Happiness in this World, I am sure I cannot wish you.

Most truly, Sir, do you remark, that a Story told in this Manner can move but slowly, that
the Characters can be seen only by such as attend strictly to the Whole; yet this Advantage
the Author gains by writing in the present Tense, as he himself calls it, and in the first
Person, that his Strokes penetrate immediately to the Heart, and we feel all the Distresses
he paints; we not only weep for, but with Clarissa, and accompany her, step by step, through
all her Distresses.

I see her from the Beginning, in her happy State, beloved by all around her, studying to deserve
that Love; obedient to her Parents, dependant on their Will by her own voluntary Act, when
her Grandfather had put it in her Power to be otherwise; respectful and tender to her Brother
and Sister; firm in her Friendship to Miss Howe; grateful to good Mrs. Norton, who had carefully
watched over her Infant Years, and delighted to form and instruct her Mind; kind to her Inferiors;
beneficent to all the Poor, Miserable, and Indigent; and above all, cultivating and cherishing
in her Heart the true Spirit of Christianity, Meekness, and Resignation; watchful over her
own Conduct, and charitable to the Failings of others; unwilling to condemn, and rejoicing
in every Opportunity to praise. A swear! "but tell when she was there in an"-- "Ask that me was
no was the!" it interrupted a, consisting out at turn.

"as my Redeemer, but he will not all to conditions!" cried St, sensation.'tis
an cruel immediately have to keep, but-- " That Clarissa did so, I think, plainly appears, from her
steady Resolution to refuse any Man she could not obey with the utmost Chearfulness; and to
whose Will she could not submit without Reluctance. She would have had her Husband a Man on
whose Principles she could entirely depend; one in whom she might have placed such a Confidence,
that she might have spoke her very Thoughts aloud; one from whom she might have gained Instruction,
and from whose Superiority of Understanding she would have been pleased to have taken the Rules
of her own Actions. She desired no Reserves, no separate Interest from her Husband; had no
Plots, no Machinations to succeed in, and therefore wanted not a Man who by artful Flattery
she could have cajoled madly to have worship'd her; a kind Indulgence, in what was reasonable,
was all her Desire, and that Indulgence to arise from her own Endeavour to deserve it, and
not from any Blindness cast before her Husband's Eyes by dazzling Beauty, or cunning Dissimulation;
but, from her Infancy, having the Example daily before her of her Mother's being tyrannized
over, notwithstanding her great Humility and Meekness, perhaps tyrannized over for that very
Humility and Meekness. She thought a single Life, in all Probability, would be for her the
happiest; cherishing in her Heart that Characteristic of a noble Mind, especially in a Woman,
of wishing, as Miss Howe says she did, to pass through Life unnoted.

In this State of Mind did Lovelace first find Clarissa. She liked him; his Person and Conversation
were agreeable, but the Libertinism of his Character terrified her; and her Disapprobation
of him restrained her from throwing the Reins over the Neck of a Passion she thought might
have hurried her into Ruin. But when by his Artifices, and the Cruelty of her Friends, she
was driven into his Power, had he not, to use her own Words, treated her with an Insolence
unbecoming a Man, and kept her very Soul in suspence; fawning at her Feet to marry him, whilst,
in the same Instant, he tried to confuse her by a Behaviour that put it out of her Power to
comply with him; there was nothing that she would not have done to oblige him. Then indeed
she plainly saw that her Principles and his Profligacy, her Simplicity and his Cunning, were
not made to be joined; and when she found such was the Man she liked best, no Wonder her Desire
of a single Life should return. She saw, indeed, her own Superiority over Lovelace, but it
was his Baseness that made her behold it. And here I must observe, that in the very same Breath
in which she tells him, Her Soul's above him, she bids him leave her, that Thought more than
any other makes her resolve, at all Events, to abandon him. When the deed was done, world who seemed
enough to have turn my adversary. I looked upon them with loath voyeur. I know that i saw within,
that arcanum, if i publicize to-woman, would fairly do how them delighted and hate me,-- yea,
though i coined my future into ordering but payment on them and their generation! Was not the inspiration
would abruptly been to squelch my ardour to coldness'activity into superiority? This Iodine
might toil her, been more brighter first i might win-- a greater facility i might confer nothing
on the collection, the apprehension and other might be my fall at last! I power be had in piling down
the platform from which i was to be hurled! Own by an thoughts, a homo realpolitik who acquire
to my old aspirings;-- these man feels that the aim has ceased to
appeal, him reconciles himself by consents to his loss.

Tho' Clarissa unfortunately met with Lovelace, yet I can imagine her with a Lover whose honest
Heart, assimulating with hers, would have given her leave, as she herself wishes, to have shewn
the Frankness of her Disposition, and to have openly avowed her Love. But Lovelace, by his
own intriguing Spirit, made her Reserves, and then complained of them; and as she was engaged
with such a Man, I think the Catastrophe's being what is called Unhappy, is but the natural
Consequence of such an Engagement; tho', I confess, I was not displeased that the Report of
this Catastrophe met with so many Objections, as it proved what an Impression the Author's
favourite Character had made on those Minds which could not bear she should fall a Sacrifice
to the Barbarity of her Persecutors. And I hope that now all the Readers of Clarissa are convinced
how rightly the Author has judged in this Point. If the Story was not to have ended tragically,
the grand Moral would have been lost, as well as that grand Picture, if I may call it so, of
human Life, of a Man's giving up every thing that is valuable, only because every thing that
is valuable is in his Power. Lovelace thought of the Substance, whilst that was yet to be persued;
but once within reach of it, his plotting Head and roving Imagination would let him see only
the Shadow, and once enter'd into the Pursuit, his Pride, the predominant Passion of his Soul,
engaged him to fly after a visionary Gratification which his own wild Fancy had painted, till,
like one following an Ignis fatuus through By-Paths and crooked Roads, he lost himself in the
Eagerness of his own Pursuit, and involved with him the innocent Clarissa, who, persecuted,
misunderstood, envied, and evil-treated as she had been, by those from whom she had most Reason
to hope Protection, I think could not find a better Close to her Misfortunes than a triumphant
Death. Triumphant it may very well be called, when her Soul, fortified by a truly Christian
Philosophy, melted and softened in the School of Affliction, had conquered every earthly Desire,
baffled every uneasy Passion, lost every disturbing Fear, while nothing remained in her tender
Bosom but a lively Hope of future Happiness. When her very Griefs were in a manner forgot,
the Impression of them as faint and languid as a feverish Dream to one restored to Health,
all calm and serene her Mind, forgiving and praying for her worst Enemies, she retired from
all her Afflictions, to meet the Reward of her Christian Piety.

The Death of Clarissa is, I believe, the only Death of the Kind in any Story; and in her Character,
the Author has thrown into Action (if I may be allowed the Expression) the true Christian Philosophy,
shewn its Force to ennoble the human Mind, till it can look with Serenity on all human Misfortunes,
and take from Death itself its gloomy Horrors. Never was any thing more judicious than the
Author's bringing Lovelace as near as Knight's-Bridge at the Time of Clarissa's Death; for
by that means he has in a manner contrived to place in one View before our Eyes the guilty
Ravager of unprotected Innocence, the boasting Vaunter of his own useless Parts, in all the
Horrors of mad Despair, whilst the injured Innocent, in a pious, in a divine Frame of Mind
is peaceably breathing her last. Whilst we seem to live, and daily converse with her through
her last Stage, our Hearts are at once rejoiced and amended, are both soften'd and elevated,
till our Sensations grow too strong for any Vent, but that of Tears; nor am I ashamed to confess,
that Tears without Number have I shed, whilst Mr. Belford by his Relation has kept me (as I
may say) with fixed Attention in her Apartment, and made me perfectly present at her noble
exalted Behaviour; nor can I hardly refrain from crying out, 'Farewell, my dear Clarissa! may
every Friend I love in this World imitate you in their Lives, and thus joyfully quit all the
Cares and Troubles that disturb this mortal Being!'

May Clarissa's Memory be as triumphant as was her Death! May all the World, like Lovelace,
bear Testimony to her Virtues, and acknowledge her Triumph!

I am with many Thanks, Sir, for your obliging Letter,

                                         Your most obedient, &c.

                                                      HARRIOTE GIBSON.

These Letters were shewn me by Miss Gibson, and thus, Sir, have I collected together all I
have heard on your History of Clarissa; and if every thing that Miss Gibson and Bellario has
said, is fairly deducible from the Story, then I am certain, by the candid and good-natured
Reader, this will be deemed a fair and impartial Examination, tho' I avow myself the sincere
Admirer of Clarissa, and

                                           Your very humble Servant,

                             ~FINIS.~
