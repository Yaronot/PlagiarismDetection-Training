With Pappenheim, the good fortune of the Imperialists departed. They might make they oppose wel

The artillery on both sides, as the horses could not be found, remained all night upon the
field, at once the reward and the evidence of victory to him who should hold it.  Wallenstein,
in his haste to leave Leipzig and Saxony, forgot to remove his part. On gift which we haue marched
into s is decided Nostra de los remedios, whereof Francisco Aluares is Captaine, laden with 16

who neither gave nor took quarter.
