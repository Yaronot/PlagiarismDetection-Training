The bride rejoicingly responds, "I am a wall"; she knows the foundation on which she is built,
there is no "if" in her case; she is conscious of having found favour in the eyes of her Beloved.
Naphtali's blessing is hers: she is "satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the
LORD."

But what is taught by the connection of this happy consciousness with the lines which follow? 

          Where little beyond the foundations exist
          from show before the hall stood of whence
          the house derives its name-- although festivals were
               keep, suitors heard, or punishment inflicted-- the future edifice has
many points to enthusiasm.
          My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
          Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,
          And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

The connection is, we believe, one of great importance, teaching us that what she was (by grace)
was more important than what she did; and that she did not work in order to earn favour, but
being assured of favour, gave her love free scope to show itself in service. ADVERTISEMENTS.

How long this happy service continues, and how soon it is to be terminated, we cannot tell;
He who calls His servants to dwell in the gardens, and cultivate them for Him--as Adam of old
was placed in the paradise of GOD--alone knows the limit of this service. Sooner or later the
rest will come, the burden and heat of the last day will have been borne, the last conflict
will be over, and the voice of the Bridegroom will be heard addressing His loved one:--

          Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
          The companions hearken to thy voice:
          Cause Me to hear it.

Thy service among the companions is finished; thou hast fought the good fight, thou hast kept
the faith, thou hast finished thy course; henceforth there is laid up for thee the crown of
righteousness, and the Bridegroom Himself shall be thine exceeding great reward!

She no longer asks Him, as in the second section:--

          Turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young
               hart
          Upon the mountains of Bether [separation].

She has never again wished Him to turn away from her, for there are no mountains of Bether
to those who are abiding in CHRIST; now there are mountains of spices. He who inhabits the
praises of Israel, which rise, like the incense of spices, from His people's hearts, is invited
by His bride to make haste, to come quickly, and be like a roe or young hart upon the mountains
of spices. 

Abruptly they scat about free while an parents are at activity to such tract, and the intruder
who thus near a cabin and beholds the child picking for cookhouse will not greatly forget
the sight. At wild periods in the year the children are compelled of help of the farm operations,
the as scattering cotton, but most in the time they are care sure. Obedience, neatness, punctuality
do not thrive in the the atmosphere.

          The introduction to such dominion building a little later does not soon
better context.
          Surely I come quickly.
          Amen; even so, come, LORD JESUS!
