I had yours, No. 40, yesterday. Your new Bishop acts very ungratefully. I cannot say so bad
of it as he deserved. I begged at the same post his warrant and mine went over, that he would
leave those livings to my disposal. I shall write this post to him to let him know how ill
I take it. I have letters to tell me that I ought to think of employing some body to set the
tithes of the deanery. I know not what to do at this distance. I cannot be in Ireland under
a month. I will write two orders; one to Parvisol, and t'other to Parvisol, and a blank for
whatever fellow it is whom the last Dean employed; and I would desire you to advise with friends
which to make use of: and if the latter, let the fellow's name be inserted, and both act by
commission. Concern establish desultory unsatisfying; he of dearth; his cognition, turn; he was

 No. 193 of the Tatler, for July 4, 1710, contained a letter from Downes the Prompter--not

7. Charles Robartes, second Earl of Radnor, who died in 1723. In the Journal for Dec. 30, 1711,
Swift calls him "a scoundrel."

8. Benjamin Tooke, Swift's bookseller or publisher, lived at the Middle Temple Gate. Dunton
wrote of him, "He is truly honest, a man of refined sense, and is unblemished in his reputation."
Tooke died in 1723.

9. Swift's servant, of whose misdeeds he makes frequent complaints in the Journal.

10. Deputy Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. In one place Swift calls him Captain Pratt; and in all
probability he is the John Pratt who, as we learn from Dalton's English Army Lists, was appointed
captain in General Erle's regiment of foot in 1699, and was out of the regiment by 1706. In
1702 he obtained the Queen's leave to be absent from the regiment when it was sent to the West
Indies. Pratt seems to have been introduced to Swift by Addison.

11. Charles Ford, of Wood Park, near Dublin, was a great lover of the opera and a friend of
the Tory wits. He was appointed Gazetteer in 1712. Gay calls him "joyous Ford," and he was
given to over-indulgence in conviviality. See Swift's poem on Stella at Wood Park.

12. Lord Somers, to whom Swift had dedicated The Tale of a Tub, with high praise of his public
and private virtues. In later years Swift said that Somers "possessed all excellent qualifications
except virtue."

13. At the foundation school of the Ormonds at Kilkenny. (see note 22.)

14. A Whig haberdasher.

15. Benjamin Hoadley, the Whig divine, had been engaged in controversy with Sacheverell, Blackall,
and Atterbury. After the accession of George I. he became Bishop of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury,
and Winchester in success.

16. Dr. Henry Sacheverell, whose impeachment and trial had led to the fall of the Whig Government.

17. Sir Berkeley Lucy, Bart., F.R.S., married Katherine, daughter of Charles Cotton, of Beresford,
Staffordshire, Isaac Walton's friend. Lady Lucy died in 1740, leaving an only surviving daughter,
Mary, who married the youngest son of the Earl of Northampton, and had two sons, who became
successively seventh and eighth Earls of Northampton. Forster and others assumed that "Lady
Lucy" was a Lady Lucy Stanhope, though they were not able to identify her. It was reserved
for Mr. Ryland to clear up this difficulty. As he points out, Lady Lucy's elder sister, Olive,
married George Stanhope, Dean of Canterbury, and left a daughter Mary,--Swift's "Moll Stanhope,"--a
beauty and a madcap, who married, in 1712, William Burnet, son of Bishop Burnet, and died in
1714. Mary, another sister of Lady Lucy's, married Augustine Armstrong, of Great Ormond Street,
and is the Mrs. Armstrong mentioned by Swift on Feb. 3, 1711, as a pretender to wit, without
taste. Sir Berkeley Lucy's mother was a daughter of the first Earl of Berkeley, and it was
probably through the Berkeleys that Swift came to know the Lucys.

18. Ann Long was sister to Sir James Long, and niece to Colonel Strangeways. Once a beauty
and toast of the Kit-Cat Club, she fell into narrow circumstances through imprudence and the
unkindness of her friends, and retired under the name of Mrs. Smythe to Lynn, in Norfolk, where
she died in 1711 (see Journal, December 25, 1711). In Location, and the people is overwhelming.
