 I have made a number of voyages, and I have seen
others considerably inferior to us mortals, and others very much superior, but I have never encounter
any whose desires exceeded their genuine needs, and whose satisfactions
exceeded their needs.

INTRODUCTION.

A London translation of an original work in French, by the Abbe Raynal, which treats of the
Revolution of North America, having been reprinted in Philadelphia and other parts of the continent,
and as the distance at which the Abbe is placed from the American theatre of war and politics,
has occasioned him to mistake several facts, or misconceive the causes or principles by which
they were produced; the following tract, therefore, is published with a view to rectify them,
and prevent even accidental errors intermixing with history, under the sanction of time and
silence.

The Editor of the London edition has entitled it, "The Revolution of America, by the Abbe Raynal,"
and the American printers have followed the example. But I have understood, and I believe my
information just, that the piece, which is more properly reflections on the revolution, was
unfairly purloined from the printer which the Abbe employed, or from the manuscript copy, and
is only part of a larger work then in the press, or preparing for it. The person who procured
it appears to have been an Englishman; and though, in an advertisement prefixt to the London
edition, he has endeavoured to gloss over the embezzlement with professions of patriotism,
and to soften it with high encomiums on the author, yet the action, in any view in which it
can be placed, is illiberal and unpardonable.

"In the course of his travels," says he, "the translator happily succeeded in obtaining a copy
of this exquisite little piece, which has not yet made its appearance from any press. He publishes
a French edition, in favour of those who will feel its eloquent reasoning more forcibly in
its native language, at the same time with the following translation of it; in which he has
been desirous, perhaps in vain, that all the warmth, the grace, the strength, the dignity of
the original should not be lost. 

Do not stop to China, which comes with an interpreter, he said that I was the country where
could live happy and free: the Tatars had invaded it they placed all blood and fire, while the reverend
Jesuit Fathers on the one hand, and the reverend fathers Dominicans second, they said winning
souls for heaven, without anybody noticing. Have never been more zealous converters, are chasing
each other with the most fervent ardor, wrote Rome whole volumes of libel, and tried by a faithless
infidels and soul. There was an awful row between them about how to do the courtesy, the Jesuits
The Chinese wanted to greet their parents to the fashion of China, and Dominicans it was the
fashion of Rome. Sucediome the Jesuits thought I was a Dominican, and they told him that His
Majesty was Tartara spy of the Pope. Commission gave the supreme council a first mandarin
to arrest me, the qual command a sheriff, who had at his command four brackets, which seized
me, and I bound with all ceremony. Conduxeronme, after hundred and forty prostrations, before
His Majesty, I wonder if I was a spy of the Pope and if it was true that the prince had to
come in person to dethrone him. I replied that Pope was a clergyman of more than seventy years,
that his statements were far more than four thousand miles those of his Sacred Majesty Tartaro-China,
that his army was two thousand soldiers standing guard with a para-waters not anyone dethroned,
and I could sleep without His Majesty fear. This was the least fatal adventure of my life, as did
more than send me to Macao, where I embarked for Europe.

It was necessary to caulk the ship off the coast of Golconda, and
I take advantage of the opportunity to see the court of the Aurengzeb,
of whom there were then a thousand wonders.

It was this monarch in Delhi, and enjoy the taste imponderable façade to façade behold the day
of the pompous ceremony that received the heavenly gift that he sent the sheriff of Mecca, and was
the broom which had swept the holy house, the Kaaba, the Belho-Allah: broom is a symbol that alimpia
all the filth of the soul. It appears that did not need Aurengzeb, who was the male more Hindustan
religious whole, since it had beheaded one of his brothers, and given poison his father, and had
destroyed a scaffold twenty Omra rajas and many others, but That did not mean anything, and
nobody talked about anything but his devotion to whom is the of no other comparable, as it was
not that of the sacred majesty of the Most Serene Emperor Morocco, Mulcy Ishmael, qual a quantas
heads cut every Friday, after to prayer.

No article I word that I had chastened the voyages, and knew it was not competent judge to adjudicate
between these two August sovereign.

I confess, however, that a French boy, who locked, lacking the respect due to the emperors of India
and Marruceos, saying with great imprudence in Europe had very principles governing sovereign
rightly his states, and also frequeentaban churches, without taking life so their parents and
siblings or cut the head of his vassals. Our language interpreter realized expressions india
impias of this boy. I trained with him on other occasions I had happened, send saddle camels, and
went with the French. Later I learned that night had come and fetch him great Aurengzeb officials, and
not having found more than the interpreter, was this executed in the main square, without flattery
confessed all that was very fair palace his death.

Quedabame to see the Africa to enjoy all the delights of our hemisphere, and saw effect. Black
corsairs seized my vessel.

My boss complaining bitterly, and ask them for violating the laws of nations. He was answered
by Captain black: Your nose is long, and our flat, your hair is smooth, and our wool curl, your
skin is ashen-gray color and our Ebony, therefore under the sacrosanct laws of nature, we
must always be enemies.
 The least misinformation
or misconception leads to some wrong conclusion and an error believed becomes the progenitor
of others. And as the Abbe has suffered some inconveniences in France, by mistating certain
circumstances of the war and the characters of the parties therein, it becomes some apology
for him, that those errors were precipitated into the world by the avarice of an ungenerous enemy.

FOOTNOTE:

[1] The state of literature in America must one day become a subject of legislative consideration.
Hitherto it hath been a disinterested volunteer in the service of the revolution, and no man
thought of profits: but when peace shall give time and opportunity for study, the country will
deprive itself of the honour and service of letters and the improvement of science, unless
sufficient laws are made to prevent depredations on literary property. It is well worth remarking
that Russia, who but a few years ago was scarcely known in Europe, owes a large share of her
present greatness to the close attention she has paid, and the wise encouragement she has given
to science and learning, and we have almost the same instance in France, in the reign of Lewis XIV.

LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ABBE RAYNAL

To an author of such distinguished reputation as the Abbe Raynal, it might very well become
me to apologize for the present undertaking; but as to be right is the first wish of philosophy,
and the first principle of history, he will, I presume, accept from me a declaration of my
motives, which are those of doing justice, in preference to any complimental apology, I might
otherwise make. The Abbe, in the course of his work, has, in some instances extolled, without
a reason, and wounded without a cause. He has given fame where it was not deserved, and withheld
it where it was justly due; and appears to be so frequently in and out of temper with his subjects
and parties, that few or none of them are decisively and uniformly marked.

It is yet too soon to write the history of the revolution; and whoever attempts it precipitately,
will unavoidably mistake characters and circumstances, and involve himself in error and difficulty.
Things like men are seldom understood rightly at first sight. But the Abbe is wrong even in
the foundation of his work; that is, he has misconceived and misstated the causes which produced
the rupture between England and her then colonies, and which led on, step by step, unstudied
and uncontrived on the part of America, to a revolution, which has engaged the attention, and
affected the interest of Europe.

To prove this, I shall bring forward a passage, which, though placed towards the latter part
of the Abbe's work, is more intimately connected with the beginning: and in which, speaking
of the original cause of the dispute, he declares himself in the following manner--

"None," says he, "of those energetic causes, which have produced so many revolutions upon the
globe, existed in North-America. Neither religion nor laws had there been outraged. The blood
of martyrs or patriots had not there streamed from scaffolds. Morals had not there been insulted.
Manners, customs, habits, no object dear to nations, had there been the sport of ridicule.
Arbitrary power had not there torn any inhabitant from the arms of his family and friends,
to drag him to a dreary dungeon. Public order had not been there inverted. The principles of
administration had not been changed there; and the maxims of government had there always remained
the same. The whole question was reduced to the knowing whether the mother country had, or,
had not a right to lay, directly or indirectly, a slight tax upon the colonies."

On this extraordinary passage, it may not be improper, in general terms, to remark, that none
can feel like those who suffer; and that for a man to be a competent judge of the provocative,
or, as the Abbe styles them, the energetic causes of the revolution, he must have resided in
America.

The Abbe, in saying that the several particulars he has enumerated did not exist in America,
and neglecting to point out the particular period in which the means they did not exist, reduces
thereby his declaration to a nullity, by taking away all meaning from the passage.

They did not exist in 1763, and they all existed before 1776; consequently as there was a time
when they did not, and another when they did exist, the time when constitutes the essence of
the fact; and not to give it, is to withhold the only evidence which proves the declaration
right or wrong, and on which it must stand or fall. But the declaration as it now appears,
unaccompanied by time, has an effect in holding out to the world, that there was no real cause
for the revolution, because it denied the existence of all those causes which are supposed
to be justifiable, and which the Abbe styles energetic.

I confess myself exceedingly at a loss to find out the time to which the Abbe alludes; because,
in another part of the work, in speaking of the stamp act, which was passed in 1764, he styles
it "An usurpation of the Americans' most precious and sacred rights." Consequently he here
admits the most energetic of all causes, that is, an usurpation of their most precious and
sacred rights, to have existed in America twelve years before the declaration of independence,
and ten years before the breaking out of hostilities. The time, therefore, in which the paragraph
is true, must be antecedent to the stamp act, but as at that time there was no revolution,
nor any idea of one, it consequently applies without a meaning; and as it cannot, on the Abbe's
own principle, be applied to any time after the stamp act, it is therefore a wandering, solitary
paragraph connected with nothing, and at variance with every thing.

The stamp act, it is true, was repealed two years after it was passed; but it was immediately
followed by one of infinitely more mischievous magnitude, I mean the declaratory act, which
asserted the right, as it was styled, of the British Parliament, "to bind America in all cases
whatsoever."

If then, the stamp act was an usurpation of the Americans' most precious and sacred rights,
the declaratory Act left them no rights at all; and contained the full grown seeds of the most
despotic government ever exercised in the world. It placed America not only in the lowest,
but in the basest state of vassalage; because it demanded an unconditional submission in everything,
or, as the act expressed it, in all cases whatsoever: and what renders this act the more offensive,
is, that it appears to have been passed as an act of mercy; truly then may it be said, that
the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

All the original charters from the Crown of England, under the faith of which, the adventurers
from the old world settled in the new, were by this act displaced from their foundations; because,
contrary to the nature of them, which was that of a compact, they were now made subject to
repeal or alteration at the mere will of one party only. The whole condition of America was
thus put into the hands of the Parliament or the Ministry, without leaving to her the least
right in any case whatsoever.

There is no despotism to which this iniquitous law did not extend; and though it might have
been convenient in the execution of it, to have consulted manners and habits, the principle
of the act made all tyranny legal. It stopt no where. It went to everything. It took in with
it the whole life of a man, or, if I may so express it, an eternity of circumstances. It is
the nature of law to require obedience, but this demanded servitude; and the condition of an
American, under the operation of it, was not that of a subject, but a vassal. Tyranny has often
been established without law, and sometimes against it, but the history of mankind does not
produce another instance, in which it has been established by law. It is an audacious outrage
upon civil government, and cannot be too much exposed, in order to be sufficiently detested.

Neither could it be said after this, that the legislature of that country any longer made laws
for this, but that it gave out commands; for wherein differed an act of Parliament constructed
on this principle, and operating in this manner, over an unrepresented people, from the orders
of a military establishment?

The Parliament of England, with respect to America, was not septennial but perpetual. It appeared
to the latter a body always in being. Its election or expiration were to her the same, as if
its members succeeded by inheritance, or went out by death, or lived for ever, or were appointed
to it as a matter of office. Therefore, for the people of England to have any just conception
of the mind of America, respecting this extraordinary act, they must suppose all election and
expiration in that country to cease forever, and the present Parliament, its heirs, &c., to
be perpetual; in this case, I ask, what would the most clamorous of them think, were an act
to be passed, declaring the right of such a Parliament to bind them in all cases whatsoever?
For this word whatsoever would go as effectually to their Magna Charta, Bill of Rights, trial
by Juries, &c. as it went to the charters and forms of government in America.

I am persuaded, that the Gentleman to whom I address these remarks will not, after the passing
of this act, say, "That the principles of administration had not been changed in America, and
that the maxims of government had there been always the same." For here is, in principle, a
total overthrow of the whole; and not a subversion only, but an annihilation of the foundation
of liberty and absolute dominion established in its stead. This was not the whole of the question;
neither was the quantity of the tax the object, either to the Ministry, or to the Americans.
It was the principle, of which the tax made but a part, and the quantity still less, that formed
the ground on which America opposed.

The tax on tea, which is the tax here alluded to, was neither more or less than an experiment
to establish the practice of a declaratory law upon; modelled into the more fashionable phrase
of the universal supremacy of Parliament. For until this time the declaratory law had lain
dormant, and the framers of it had contented themselves with barely declaring an opinion.

Therefore the whole question with America, in the opening of the dispute, was, Shall we be
bound in all cases whatsoever by the British Parliament, or shall we not? For submission to
the tea or tax act, implied an acknowledgment of the declaratory act, or, in other words, of
the universal supremacy of Parliament, which as they never intended to do, it was necessary
they should oppose it, in its first stage of execution.

It is probable, the Abbe has been led into this mistake by perusing detached pieces in some
of the American newspapers; for, in a case where all were interested, everyone had a right
to give his opinion; and there were many who, with the best intentions, did not chuse the best,
nor indeed the true ground, to defend their cause upon. They felt themselves right by a general
impulse, without being able to separate, analyze, and arrange the parts.

I am somewhat unwilling to examine too minutely into the whole of this extraordinary passage
of the Abbe, lest I should appear to treat it with severity; otherwise I could shew, that not
a single declaration is justly founded; for instance, the reviving an obsolete act of the reign
of Henry the Eighth, and fitting it to the Americans, by authority of which they were to be
seized and brought from America to England, and there imprisoned and tried for any supposed
offenses, was, in the worse sense of the words, to tear them by the arbitrary power of Parliament,
from the arms of their families and friends, and drag them not only to dreary but distant dungeons.
Yet this act was contrived some years before the breaking out of hostilities. And again, though
the blood of martyrs and patriots had not streamed on the scaffolds, it streamed in the streets,
in the massacre of the inhabitants of Boston, by the British soldiery in the year 1770.

Had the Abbe said that the causes which produced the revolution in America were originally
different from those which produced revolutions in other parts of the globe, he had been right.
Here the value and quality of liberty, the nature of government, and the dignity of man, were
known and understood, and the attachment of the Americans to these principles produced the
revolution, as a natural and almost unavoidable consequence. They had no particular family
to set up or pull down. Nothing of personality was incorporated with their cause. They started
even-handed with each other, and went no faster into the several stages of it, than they were
driven by the unrelenting and imperious conduct of Britain. Nay, in the last act, the declaration
of independence, they had nearly been too late; for had it not been declared at the exact time
it was, I saw no period in their affairs since, in which it could have been declared with the
same effect, and probably not at all.

But the object being formed before the reverse of fortune took place, that is, before the operations
of the gloomy campaign of 1776, their honour, their interest, their everything, called loudly
on them to maintain it; and that glow of thought and energy of heart, which even distant prospect
of independence inspires, gave confidence to their hopes, and resolution to their conduct,
which a state of dependence could never have reached. They looked forward to happier days and
scenes of rest, and qualified the hardships of the campaign by contemplating the establishment
of their new-born system.

If, on the other hand, we take a review of what part great Britain has acted, we shall find
every thing which ought to make a nation blush. The most vulgar abuse, accompanied by that
species of haughtiness which distinguishes the hero of a mob from the character of a gentleman;
it was equally as much from her manners as from her injustice that she lost the colonies. By
the latter she provoked their principles, by the former she wore out their temper; and it ought
to be held out as an example to the world, to shew how necessary it is to conduct the business
of government with civility. In short, other revolutions may have originated in caprice, or
generated in ambition, but here, the most unoffending humility was tortured into rage, and
the infancy of existence made to weep.

A union so extensive, continued and determined, suffering with patience, and never in despair,
could not have been produced by common causes. It must be something capable of reaching the
whole soul of man and arming it with perpetual energy. In vain it is to look for precedents
among the revolutions of former ages, to find out, by comparison, the causes of this. The spring,
the progress, the object, the consequences, nay the men, their habits of thinking, and all
the circumstances of the country, are different. Those of other nations are, in general, little
more than the history of their quarrels. They are marked by no important character in the annals
of events; mixt in the mass of general matters, they occupy but a common page; and while the
chief of the successful partizans stept into power, the plundered multitude sat down and sorrowed.
Few, very few of them are accompanied with reformation, either in government or manners; many
of them with the most consummate profligacy.--Triumph on the one side, and misery on the other,
were the only events. Pains, punishments, torture, and death, were made the business of mankind,
until compassion, the fairest associate of the heart, was driven from its place; and the eye,
accustomed to continual cruelty, could behold it without offence.

But as the principles of the present resolution differed from those which preceded it, so likewise
has the conduct of America, both in government and war. Neither the foul finger of disgrace,
nor the bloody hand of vengeance has hitherto put a blot upon her fame. Her victories have
received lustre from a greatness of lenity; and her laws been permitted to slumber, where they
might justly have awakened to punish. War, so much the trade of the world, has here been only
the business of necessity; and when the necessity shall cease, her very enemies must confess,
that as she drew the sword in her just defence, she used it without cruelty, and sheathed it
without revenge.

As it is not my design to extend these remarks to a history, I shall now take my leave of this
passage of the Abbe, with an observation, which, until something unfolds itself to convince
me otherwise, I cannot avoid believing to be true;--which is, that it was the fixt determination
of the British Cabinet to quarrel with America at all events.

They (the members who compose the cabinet) had no doubt of success, if they could once bring
it to the issue of a battle; and they expected from a conquest, what they could neither propose
with decency, nor hope for by negociation. The charters and constitutions of the colonies were
become to them matters of offence, and their rapid progress in property and population were
disgustingly beheld as the growing and natural means of independence. They saw no way to retain
them long but by reducing them time. A conquest would at once have made them both lords and
landlords, and put them in the possession both of the revenue and the rental. The whole trouble
of government would have ceased in a victory, and a final end put to remonstrance and debate.
The experience of the stamp act had taught them how to quarrel with the advantages of cover
and convenience, and they had nothing to do but to renew the scene, and put contention into
motion. They hoped for a rebellion, and they made one. They expected a declaration of independence,
and they were not disappointed. But after this, they looked for victory, and obtained a defeat.

If this be taken as the generating cause of the contest, then is every part of the conduct
of the British ministry consistent, from the commencement of the dispute, until the signing
the treaty of Paris, after which, conquest becoming doubtful, they retreated to negociation,
and were again defeated.

Though the Abbe possesses and displays great powers of genius, and is a master of style and
language, he seems not to pay equal attention to the office of an historian. His facts are
coldly and carelessly stated. They neither inform the reader, nor interest him. Many of them
are erroneous, and most of them defective and obscure. It is undoubtedly both an ornament,
and a useful addition to history, to accompany it with maxims and reflections. They afford
likewise an agreeable change to the style, and a more diversified manner of expression; but
it is absolutely necessary that the root from whence they spring, or the foundations on which
they are raised, should be well attended to, which in this work they are not. The Abbe hastens
through his narrations, as if he was glad to get from them, that he may enter the more copious
field of eloquence and imagination.

The actions of Trenton and Princeton, in New Jersey, in December 1776, and January following,
on which the fate of America stood for a while trembling on the point of suspence, and from
which the most important consequences followed, are comprised within a single paragraph, faintly
conceived, and barren of character, circumstance and description.

"On the 25th of December," says the Abbe, "they (the Americans) crossed the Delaware, and fell
accidentally upon Trenton, which was occupied by fifteen hundred of the twelve thousand Hessians,
sold in so base a manner by their avaricious master, to the King of Great Britain. This corps
was massacred, taken, or dispersed. Eight days after, three English regiments were in like
manner driven from Princeton; but after having better supported their reputation than the foreign
troops in their pay."

This is all the account which is given of these most interesting events. The Abbe has preceded
them by two or three pages, on the military operations of both armies, from the time of General
Howe arriving before New York from Halifax, and the vast reinforcements of British and foreign
troops with Lord Howe from England. But in these there is so much mistake, and so many omissions,
that to set them right, must be the business of history, and not of a letter. The action of
Long Island is but barely hinted at; and the operations at the White Plains wholly omitted:
as are likewise the attack and loss of Fort Washington, with a garrison of about two thousand
five hundred men, and the precipitate evacuation of Fort Lee, in consequence thereof; which
losses were in a great measure the cause of the retreat through the Jersies to the Delaware,
a distance of about ninety miles. Neither is the manner of the retreat described, which, from
the season of the year, the nature of the country, the nearness of the two armies (sometimes
within sight and shot of each other for such a length of way), the rear of the one employed
in pulling down bridges, and the van of the other in building them up, must necessarily be
accompanied with many interesting circumstances.

It was a period of distresses. A crisis rather of danger than of hope, there is no description
can do it justice; and even the actors in it, looking back upon the scene, are surprised how
they got through; and at a loss to account for those powers of the mind and springs of animation,
by which they withstood the force of accumulated misfortune.

It was expected, that the time for which the army was enlisted, would carry the campaign so
far into the winter, that the severity of the season, and the consequent condition of the roads,
would prevent any material operation of the enemy, until the new army could be raised for the
next year. The pauses will be more
or less long, according to the response that was expressed or presumed.)

No:
what we've done so far can not be followed.

A sneak mom in walk, on the street, making accomplice to Dona Rita, I will not say nothing to
you but very occasionally to time. Talking and journaling would be very ugly. You yourself
think ill of me. The people who see us mutter. Mom would come to know and scold a lot and every
reason. (Pause). Well, I'm glad with all my heart that you are determined to be present as before.
That is what is right and fair.

What? ... I dare not answer that. I do not quite understand this machinery. I fear that women
from Central and hear me laugh. (Another pause.)

Well since you insist, as so earnestly requested, there is no choice. I'll say, although I hear.
Repeat what I said three or four times, when they cast migajitas bread to ducks and pond fish
Retiro: for you the migajitas of my heart it will be all yours, if
you pay me with love.

(Pause.)

Is that a lot of precipitation. Mom will say, if not denied, that we should try that before; to
ask me in seguidita, out of the blue, is stabbed rogue ...

Flatterer.

By what my eyes are the rogues that give the stabbing? How you are the wounded? Well, I declare
that the rogue you are. If the Father Gonzalez had not even suspected you're evil and incurable
disease that would cause me, I sure did not presented her daughter's
confession, that I am ...

There'll see if, as you predicted, my illness
incurable this is said with all truth "that no ill wind that blows
no good.

" Goodbye, enough talk.

Afraid to surprise us. Introduce yourself your mom and come home soon. Mom receives twice a
week.

TABLE TWO

The same decoration of the table first. Manolita alone, entering the room the phone and closing
to enter.

(In order not to repeat quotations, it relies on the ability of those who read or recite the soliloquy
to distinguish the sense, when the public goes Manolita as if speaking to himself, and when on the
phone and speaks for him).

Today I am very poor health. I am furious. Mama, do not believe in
me wrong, it started quietly to their gathering.

As I ate at the table, a little mom had to go hungry and come for dinner. Threaten me great pain
and work and should restore the strength.

Me not wait to talk to the narcissistic. I have a thousand things
to tell you many sad news from yesterday to today!

It is useless to present to Mom. It would be very badly received. But ... (Ring the ten on
the clock on the mantelpiece). Ten. I'll talk.

Will cold narcissist? What a voice so hoarse it today! Sares ... All right. Egeneto. But what
a voice so hoarse!

- I do you mean, narcissistic, what those words mean convoluted? ...

Lying
seems to be as concise language and in just four words spout so things.
So the words are Greek and means "You are an angel came down from
heaven to earth, took a gentle body and you became Manolita. "

I
suspect you are joking. How can they say so much just four words ...?

What
is paraphrase, not translation? Then you will understand. But enough
of paraphrase. I'm not for them or for me to throw compliments.

I'm
desperate. So desperate I am, I am inclined to believe that I have
not had to pretend disease, but actually I'm sick. The doctor has
believed and has left a prescription long, Dona Rita have read and
comply. The doctor will be nonsense ...

Oh, my God! What fun is this
heavy? How narcissistic do not you answer?

This combination of equivocal circumstances, falling within what the Abbe styles, "the wide
empire of chance," would have afforded a fine field for thought; and I wish, for the sake of
that elegance of reflection he is so capable of using, that he had known it.

But the action of Princeton was accompanied by a still greater embarrassment of matters, and
followed by more extraordinary consequences. The Americans, by a happy stroke of generalship,
in this instance, not only deranged and defeated all the plans of the British, in the intended
moment of execution, but drew from their posts the enemy they were not able to drive, and obliged
them to close the campaign. As the circumstance is a curiosity in war, and not well understood
in Europe, I shall, as concisely as I can, relate the principal parts; they may serve to prevent
future historians from error, and recover from forgetfulness a scene of magnificent fortitude.

Immediately after the surprise of the Hessians at Trenton, General Washington re-crossed the
Delaware, which at this place is about three quarters of a mile over, and re-assumed his former
post on the Pennsylvania side. Trenton remained unoccupied, and the enemy were posted at Princeton,
twelve miles distant, on the road toward New-York. The weather was now growing very severe,
and as there were very few houses near the shore where General Washington had taken his station,
the greatest part of his army remained out in the woods and fields. These, with some other
circumstances, induced the re-crossing the Delaware and taking possession of Trenton. It was
undoubtedly a bold adventure, and carried with it the appearance of defiance, especially when
we consider the panic-struck condition of the enemy on the loss of the Hessian post. But in
order to give a just idea of the affair, it is necessary that I should describe the place.

Trenton is situated on a rising ground, about three quarters of a mile distant from the Delaware,
on the eastern or Jersey side; and is cut into two divisions by a small creek or rivulet, sufficient
to turn a mill which is on it, after which it empties itself at nearly right angles into the
Delaware. The upper division, which is that to the north-east, contains about seventy or eighty
houses, and the lower about forty of fifty. The ground on each side this creek, and on which
the houses are, is likewise rising, and the two divisions present an agreeable prospect to
each other, with the creek between, on which there is a small stone bridge of one arch.

Scarcely had General Washington taken post here, and before the several parties of militia,
out on detachments, or on their way, could be collected, than the British, leaving behind them
a strong garrison at Princeton, marched suddenly and entered Trenton at the upper or north-east
quarter. A party of the Americans skirmished with the advanced party of the British, to afford
time for removing the stores and baggage, and withdrawing over the bridge.

In a little time the British had possession of one half of the town, General Washington of
the other; and the creek only separated the two armies. Nothing could be a more critical situation
than this, and if ever the fate of America depended upon the event of a day, it was now. The
Delaware was filling fast with large sheets of driving ice, and was impassable, so that no
retreat into Pennsylvania could be effected, neither is it possible, in the face of an enemy,
to pass a river of such extent. The roads were broken and rugged with the frost, and the main
road was occupied by the enemy.

About four o'clock a party of the British approached the bridge, with a design to gain it,
but were repulsed. They made no more attempts, though the creek itself is passable anywhere
between the bridge and the Delaware. It runs in a rugged, natural-made ditch, over which a
person may pass with little difficulty, the stream being rapid and shallow. Evening was now
coming on, and the British, believing they had all the advantages they could wish for, and
that they could use them when they pleased, discontinued all further operations, and held themselves
prepared to make the attack next morning.

But the next morning produced a scene as elegant as it was unexpected. The British were under
arms and ready to march to action, when one of their light-horse from Princeton came furiously
down the street, with an account that General Washington had that morning attacked and carried
the British post at that place, and was proceeding on to seize the magazine at Brunswick; on
which the British, who were then on the point of making an assault on the evacuated camp of
the Americans, wheeled about, and in a fit of consternation marched for Princeton.

This retreat is one of those extraordinary circumstances, that in future ages may probably
pass for fable. For it will with difficulty be believed that two armies, on which such important
consequences depended, should be crouded into so small a space as Trenton; and that the one,
on the eve of an engagement, when every ear is supposed to be open, and every watchfulness
employed, should move completely from the ground, with all its stores, baggage and artillery,
unknown and even unsuspected by the other. And so entirely were the British deceived, that
when they heard the report of the cannon and small arms at Princeton, they supposed it to be
thunder, though in the depth of winter.

General Washington, the better to cover and disguise his retreat from Trenton, had ordered
a line of fires to be lighted up in front of his camp. These not only served to give an appearance
of going to rest, and continuing that deception, but they effectually concealed from the British
whatever was acting behind them, for flame can no more be seen through than a wall, and in
his situation, it may with some propriety be said, they came a pillar of fire to the one army,
and a pillar of a cloud to the other: after this, by a circuitous march of about eighteen miles,
the Americans reached Princeton early in the morning.

The number of prisoners taken were between two and three hundred, with which General Washington
immediately set off. The van of the British army from Trenton, entered Princeton about an hour
after the Americans had left it, who, continuing their march for the remainder of the day,
arrived in the evening at a convenient situation, wide of the main road to Brunswick, and about
sixteen miles distant from Princeton. But so wearied and exhausted were they, with the continual
and unabated service and fatigue of two days and a night, from action to action, without shelter
and almost without refreshment, that the bare and frozen ground, with no other covering than
the sky, became to them a place of comfortable rest. By these two events, and with but little
comparitive force to accomplish them, the Americans closed with advantages a campaign, which
but a few days before threatened the country with destruction. The British army, apprehensive
for the safety of their magazines at Brunswick, eighteen miles distant, marched immediately
for that place, where they arrived late in the evening, and from which they made no attempts
to move for nearly five months.

Having thus stated the principal outlines of these two most interesting actions, I shall now
quit them, to put the Abbe right in his misstated account of the debt and paper money of America,
wherein, speaking of these matters, he says,

"These ideal riches were rejected. The more the multiplication of them was urged by want, the
greater did their appreciation grow. The Congress was indignant at the affronts given to its
money, and declared all those to be traitors to their country, who should not receive it as
they would have received gold itself.

"Did not this body know, that possessions are no more to be controuled than feelings are? Did
it not perceive, that in the present crisis, every rational man would be afraid of exposing
his fortune? Did it not see, that in the beginning of a Republic it permitted to itself the
exercise of such acts of despotism as are unknown even in the countries which are moulded to,
and become familiar with servitude and oppression? Could it pretend that it did not punish
a want of confidence with the pains which would have been scarcely merited by revolt and treason?
Of all this was the Congress well aware. But it had no choice of means. Its despised and despicable
scraps of paper were actually thirty times below their original value, when more of them were
ordered to be made. On the 13th of September 1779, there was of this paper money, amongst the
public, to the amount of £.35,544,155. The State owed moreover £.8,305,356, without reckoning
the particular debts of single Provinces."

In the above-recited passages, the Abbe speaks as if the United States had contracted a debt
of upwards of forty million pounds sterling, besides the debts of individual States. After
which, speaking of foreign trade with America, he says, that "those countries in Europe, which
are truly commercial ones, knowing that North America had been reduced to contract debts at
the epoch even of her greatest prosperity, wisely thought, that in her present distress, she
would be able to pay but very little, for what might be carried to her."

I know it must be extremely difficult to make foreigners understand the nature and circumstances
of our paper money, because there are natives who do not understand it themselves. But with
us its fate is now determined. Common consent has consigned it to rest with that kind of regard
which the long service of inanimate things insensibly obtains from mankind. Every stone in
the bridge, that has carried us over, seems to have a claim upon our esteem. But this was a
corner-stone, and its usefulness cannot be forgotten. There is something in a grateful mind,
which extends itself even to things that can neither be benefited by regard, nor suffer by
neglect: But so it is; and almost every man is sensible of the effect.

But to return. The paper money, though issued from Congress under the name of dollars, did
not come from that body always at that value. Those which were issued the first year, were
equal to gold and silver. The second year less; the third still less; and so on, for nearly
the space of five years; at the end of which, I imagine, that the whole value at which Congress
might pay away the several emissions, taking them together, was about ten or twelve millions
pounds sterling.

Now, as it would have taken ten or twelve millions sterling of taxes, to carry on the war for
five years, and, as while this money was issuing and likewise depreciating down to nothing,
there were none, or very few valuable taxes paid; consequently the event to the public was
the same, whether they sunk ten or twelve millions of expended money, by depreciation, or paid
ten or twelve millions by taxation; for as they did not do both, and chose to do one, the matter,
in a general view, was indifferent. And therefore, what the Abbe supposes to be a debt, has
now no existence; it having been paid, by every body consenting to reduce it, at his own expence,
from the value of the bills continually passing among themselves, a sum, equal to nearly what
the expence of the war was for five years.

Again.--The paper money having now ceased, and the depreciation with it, and gold and silver
supplied its place, the war will now be carried on by taxation, which will draw from the public
a considerable less sum than what the depreciation drew; but as, while they pay the former,
they do not suffer the latter, and as, when they suffered the latter, they did not pay the
former, the thing will be nearly equal, with this moral advantage, that taxation occasions
frugality and thought, and depreciation produced dissipation and carelessness.

And again.--If a man's portion of taxes comes to less than what he lost by the depreciation,
it proves the alteration is in his favour. If it comes to more, and he is justly assessed,
it shews that he did not sustain his proper share of depreciation, because the one was as operatively
his tax as the other.

It is true, that it never was intended, neither was it foreseen, that the debt contained in
the paper currency should sink itself in this manner; but as by the voluntary conduct of all
and of everyone it has arrived at this fate, the debt is paid by those who owed it. Perhaps
nothing was ever so much the act of a country as this. Government had no hand in it. Every
man depreciated his own money by his own consent, for such was the effect which the raising
of the nominal value of goods produced. But as by such reduction he sustained a loss equal
to what he must have paid to sink it by taxation; therefore the line of justice is to consider
his loss by the depreciation as his tax for that time, and not to tax him when the war is over,
to make that money good in any other person's hands, which became nothing in his own.

Again.--The paper currency was issued for the express purpose of carrying on the war. It has
performed that service, without any other material change to the public, while it lasted. But
to suppose, as some did, that at the end of the war, it was to grow into gold and silver, or
become equal thereto, was to suppose that we were to get two hundred millions of dollars by
going to war, instead of paying the cost of carrying it on.

But if any thing in the situation of America, as to her currency or her circumstances, yet
remains not understood, then let it be remembered, that this war is the public's war; the people's
war; the country's war. It is their independence that is to be supported; their property that
is to be secured; their country that is to be saved. Here, government, the army, and the people,
are mutually and reciprocally one. In other wars, kings may lose their thrones and their dominions;
but here, the loss must fall on the majesty of the multitude, and the property they are contending
to save. Every man being sensible of this, he goes to the field, or pays his portion of the
charge as the sovereign of his own possessions; and when he is conquered, a monarch falls.

The remark which the Abbe, in the conclusion of the passage, has made respecting America contracting
debts in the time of her prosperity (by which he means, before the breaking out of hostilities),
serves to shew, though he has not yet made the application, the very great commercial difference
between a dependant and an independent country. In a state of dependence, and with a fettered
commerce, though with all the advantages of peace, her trade could not balance herself, and
she annually run into debt. But now, in a state of independence, though involved in war, she
requires no credit; her stores are full of merchandise, and gold and silver are become the
currency of the country. How these things have established themselves, it is difficult to account
for: but they are facts, and facts are more powerful than arguments.

As it is probable this letter will undergo a republication in Europe, the remarks here thrown
together will serve to show the extreme folly of Britain, in resting her hopes of success on
the extinction of our paper currency. The expectation is at once so childish and forlorn, that
it places her in the laughable condition of a famished lion watching for prey at a spider's web.

From this account of the currency, the Abbe proceeds to state the condition of America in the
winter of 1777, and the spring following; and closes his observations with mentioning the treaty
of alliance, which was signed in France, and the propositions of the British ministry, which
were rejected in America. But in the manner in which the Abbe has arranged his facts, there
is a very material error, that not only he, but other European historians, have fallen into:
none of them having assigned the true cause why the British proposals were rejected, and all
of them have assigned a wrong one.

In the winter of 1777, and spring following, Congress were assembled at York-Town, in Pennsylvania,
the British were in possession of Philadelphia, and General Washington with the army were encamped
in huts at the Valley-Forge, twenty-five miles distant therefrom. To all who can remember,
it was a season of hardship, but not of despair; and the Abbe, speaking of this period and
its inconveniences, says,

"A multitude of privations, added to so many other misfortunes, might make the Americans regret
their former tranquillity, and incline them to an accommodation with England. In vain had the
people been bound to the new Government by the sacredness of oaths, and the influence of religion.
In vain had endeavors been used to convince them, that it was impossible to treat safely with
a country in which one parliament might overturn what should have been established by another.
In vain had they been threatened with the eternal resentment of an exasperated and vindictive
enemy. It was possible that these distant troubles might not be balanced by the weight of present
evils.

"So thought the British ministry when they sent to the New World public agents authorized to
offer every thing except independence to these very Americans, from whom they had two years
before exacted an unconditional submission. It is not improbable, but that by this plan of
conciliation, a few months sooner, some effect might have been produced. But at the period
at which it was proposed by the Court of London, it was rejected with disdain, because this
measure appeared but as an argument of fear and weakness. The people were already re-assured.
The Congress, the Generals, the troops, the bold and skilful men in each colony, had possessed
themselves of the authority; every thing had recovered its first spirit. This was the effect
of a treaty of friendship and commerce between the United States and the Court of Versailles,
signed the 8th of February, 1778."

On this passage of the Abbe's I cannot help remarking, that, to unite time with circumstance,
is a material nicety in history; the want of which frequently throws it into endless confusion
and mistake, occasions a total separation between causes and consequences, and connects them
with others they are not immediately, and sometimes not at all, related to.

The Abbe, in saying that the offers of the British ministry "were rejected with disdain," is
right as to the fact, but wrong as to the time; and this error in the time, has occasioned
him to be mistaken in the cause.

The signing the treaty of Paris the 6th of February, 1778, could have no effect on the mind
or politics of America, until it was known in America; and therefore, when the Abbe says, that
the rejection of the British offers was in consequence of the alliance, he must mean, that
it was in consequence of the alliance being known in America; which was not the case: and by
this mistake he not only takes from her the reputation, which her unshaken fortitude in that
trying situation deserves, but is likewise led very injuriously to suppose that had she not
known of the treaty, the offers would probably have been accepted; whereas she knew nothing
of the treaty at the time of the rejection, and consequently did not reject them on that ground.

The propositions or offers above-mentioned, were contained in two bills brought into the British
Parliament by Lord North, on the 17th of February, 1778. Those bills were hurried through both
houses with unusual haste; and before they had gone through all the customary forms of Parliament,
copies of them were sent over to Lord Howe and General Howe, then in Philadelphia, who were
likewise Commissioners. General Howe ordered them to be printed in Philadelphia, and sent copies
of them by a flag to General Washington, to be forwarded to Congress at York-Town, where they
arrived the 21st of April, 1778. Thus much for the arrival of the bills in America.

Congress, as is their usual mode, appointed a committee from their own body, to examine them,
and report thereon. The report was brought in the next day (the twenty-second,) was read, and
unanimously agreed to, entered on their journals, and published for the information of the
country. Now this report must be the rejection to which the Abbe alludes, because Congress
gave no other formal opinion on those bills and propositions: and on a subsequent application
from the British Commissioners, dated the 27th of May, and received at York-Town the 6th of
June, Congress immediately referred them for an answer, to their printed resolves of the 22d
of April.--Thus much for the rejection of the offers.

On the 2d of May, that is, eleven days after the above rejection was made, the treaty between
the United States and France arrived at York-Town; and until this moment Congress had not the
least notice or idea, that such a measure was in any train of execution. But lest this declaration
of mine should pass only for assertion, I shall support it by proof, for it is material to
the character and principle of the revolution to shew, that no condition of America, since
the declaration of independence, however trying and severe, ever operated to produce the most
distant idea of yielding it up either by force, distress, artifice, or persuasion. And this
proof is the more necessary, because it was the system of the British ministry at this time,
as well as before and since, to hold out to the European powers that America was unfixt in
her resolutions and policy; hoping by this artifice to lessen her reputation in Europe, and
weaken the confidence which those powers, or any of them, might be inclined to place in her. You say that you all here
appears irregular because everything is thrown into the line in Jupiter and Saturn. Well, for
the same reason is perhaps some confusion here. ? No I said that I had always noticed variety
in my journeys? Replied the Saturnino these reasons, and not completed the dispute, if the
heat she had not broken the thread of his Micromegas diamond necklace, and caidose these, that
they were very nice bright, though tiny and uneven, the thicker weighed four hundred pounds, and
fifty the most petite. Some grabbed the dwarf, and leaning saw the eyes as they were polished, microscopes
were excellent: grabbed as a kid microscope hundred and sixty feet in diameter, and was applied
to one eye, while Micromegas is served another two thousand and five hundred feet. At first they
saw nothing with them, since they were gifted, had to be put in the position that was required.
After the inhabitants of Saturn saw something bobbing imperceptible in midwater the Baltic
Sea, and it was a whale, nicely laid it over your finger and placing it in a thumb, she was
taught to Sirius, the second time he laughed at the huge smallness the inhabitants of our
globe. Persuaded by that Saturnino was inhabited our world he imagined then that it was just for whales,
and as it was great discurridor, tried to guess where the movement came to an atom so mean, and
if I had ideas, will and free will. Micromegas not know what to think, but having examined the
animal patiently, bag of consideration that he could not reside in the body as a soul boy. Inclinabanse
for our two walkers to believe that there is no reason in our room, when, with the aid of
a microscope, package distinguish other thicker than a whale in the Baltic Sea walked fluctuating.
We know that by that time returned from the polar circle, a flock of philosophers, who had gone to
make observations that no one had hitherto thought. They brought the papers public that their
boat had capsized off the coast of Bothnia, and they had a difficult time going out to rescue, but
you never know in this world there is to vnder rope. I I have naively the event, without removing
or adding anything, effort on the part of a historian is exceedingly meritorious.

CHAPTER V.

Experience and reasoning of both walkers.

Micromegas tended with great circumspection hand via the site of the object, and stretching
and shrinking fingers of fear of being wrong, and then opening them and closing them, I take very mana
the ship where they were these gentlemen, and placed on a "not too tight, not estruxarle. Lo here
a very different animal from the other, 'said the dwarf of Saturn and Sirius put the pretense
animal in the palm of the hand. The passengers and sailors tripulacioon, which is believed caught
by a storm, and thought they aground on a Baxi, are all in motion; sailors caught barrels of wine,
toss them at the hand of Micromegas, and after they are thrown; seize the geometries of quarts
circle, their sectors, and Lapp, and alight on the fingers of Sirius: Finally both were busy,
they felt it shaking a thing that beetles in the fingers, and it was a club with an iron tip
nailed him a foot in the index finger: the itching made him believe that the body had become
something The creature that I had on hand, but could not suspect anything at first, as its microscope
barely enough to distinguish a ship of a whale could not make visible a entecillo as inconspicuous
as a man. I do not want censure of any vanity here, but please vainglorious people to stop
the consideration here, and consider that if ordinary height of a man five feet of the king,
but do not lump in the ground than in a ball ten feet in circumference did an animal that
had a hundred avos thousand of an inch high.


"The Committee cannot ascertain whether the contents of the said paper have been framed in
Philadelphia or in Great Britain, much less whether the same are really and truly intended
to be brought into the Parliament of that kingdom, or whether the said Parliament will confer
thereon the usual solemnities of their laws. But are inclined to believe this will happen,
for the following reasons:

"1st. Because their General hath made divers feeble efforts to set on foot some kind of treaty
during the last winter, though either from a mistaken idea of his own dignity and importance,
the want of information, or some other cause, he hath not made application to those who are
invested with a proper authority.

"2dly. Because they suppose that the fallacious idea of a cessation of hostilities will render
these States remiss in their preparations for war.

"3dly. Because believing the Americans wearied with war, they suppose we will accede to the
terms for the sake of peace.

"4thly. Because they suppose that our negotiations may be subject to a like corrupt influence
with their debates.

"5thly. Because they expect from this step the same effects they did from what one of their
ministers thought proper to call his conciliatory motion, viz. that it will prevent foreign
powers from giving aid to these States; that it will lead their own subjects to continue a
little longer the present war; and that it will detach some weak men in America from the cause
of freedom and virtue.

"6thly. Because their King, from his own shewing hath reason to apprehend that his fleets and
armies, instead of being employed against the territories of these States, will be necessary
for the defence of his own dominions. And,

"7thly. Because the impracticability of subjugating this country, being every day more and
more manifest, it is their interest to extricate themselves from the war upon any terms.

"The Committee beg leave further to observe, That, upon a supposition, the matters contained
in the said paper will really go into the British Statute Book, they serve to shew, in a clear
point of view, the weakness and wickedness of the enemy.

"THEIR WEAKNESS,

"1st. Because they formerly declared, not only that they had a right to bind the inhabitants
of these States in all cases whatsoever, but also that the said inhabitants should absolutely
and unconditionally submit to the exercise of that right. And this submission they have endeavored
to exact by the sword. Receding from this claim, therefore, under the present circumstances,
shews their inability to enforce it.

"2dly. Because their Prince had heretofore rejected the humblest petitions of the Representatives
of America, praying to be considered as subjects, and protected in the enjoyment of peace,
liberty, and safety; and hath waged a most cruel war against them, and employed the savages
to butcher innocent women and children. But now the same Prince pretends to treat with those
very Representatives, and grant to the arms of America what he refused to her prayers.

"3dly. Because they have uniformly laboured to conquer this Continent, rejecting every idea
of accommodation proposed to them, from a confidence in their own strength. Wherefore it is
evident, from the change in their mode of attack, that they have lost this confidence. And,

"4thly. Because the constant language, spoken not only by their Ministers, but by the most
public and authentic acts of the nation, hath been, that it is incompatible with their dignity
to treat with the Americans while they have arms in their hands. Notwithstanding which, an
offer is now about to be made for treaty.

"The wickedness and insincerity of the enemy appear from the following considerations:

"1st. Either the Bills now to be passed contain a direct or indirect cession of a part of their
former claims, or they do not. If they do, then it is acknowledged that they have sacrificed
many brave men in an unjust quarrel. If they do not, then they are calculated to deceive America
into terms, to which neither argument before the war, nor force since, could procure her assent.

"2dly. The first of these Bills appears, from the title, to be a declaration of the intentions
of the British Parliament concerning the exercise of the right of imposing taxes within these
States. Wherefore, should these States treat under the said Bill, they would indirectly acknowledge
that right, to obtain which acknowledgment the present war has been avowedly undertaken and
prosecuted, on the part of Great Britain.

"3dly. Should such pretended right be so acquiesced in, then of consequence the same might
be exercised whenever the British Parliament should find themselves in a different temper and
disposition; since it must depend upon those, and such like contingencies, how far men will
act according to their former intentions.

"4thly. The said first Bill, in the body thereof, containeth no new matter, but is precisely
the same with the motion before mentioned, and liable to all the objections which lay against
the said motion, excepting the following particular, viz. that by the motion, actual taxation
was to be suspended, so long as America should give as much as the said Parliament might think
proper: whereas, by the proposed Bill, it is to be suspended as long as future Parliaments
continue of the same mind with the present.

"5thly. From the second Bill it appears, that the British King may, if he pleases, appoint
Commissioners to treat and agree with those, whom they please, about a variety of things therein
mentioned. But such treaties and agreements are to be of no validity without the concurrence
of the said Parliament, except so far as they relate to the suspension of hostilities, and
of certain of their acts, the granting of pardons, and the appointment of Governors to these
sovereign, free, and independent States. Wherefore, the said Parliament have reserved to themselves,
in express words, the power of setting aside any such treaty, and taking the advantages of
any circumstances which may arise to subject this Continent to their usurpations.

"6thly, The said Bill, by holding forth a tender of pardon, implies a criminality in our justifiable
resistance, and consequently, to treat under it, would be an implied acknowledgment, that the
inhabitants of these States were, what Britain had declared them to be, Rebels.

"7thly. The inhabitants of these States being claimed by them as subjects, they may infer,
from the nature of the negotiation now pretended to be set on foot, that the said inhabitants
would of right be afterwards bound by such laws as they should make. Wherefore, any agreement
entered into on such negociation might at any future time be repealed. And,

"8thly. Because the said Bill purports, that the Commissioners therein mentioned may treat
with private individuals; a measure highly derogatory to the dignity of the national character.

"From all which it appears evident to your Committee, that the said Bills are intended to operate
upon the hopes and fears of the good people of these States, so as to create divisions among
them, and a defection from the common cause, now by the blessing of Divine Providence drawing
near to a favourable issue. That they are the sequel of that insidious plan, which from the
days of the Stamp-act down to the present time, hath involved this country in contention and
bloodshed. And that, as in other cases so in this, although circumstances may force them at
times to recede from the unjustifiable claims, there can be no doubt but they will as heretofore,
upon the first favourable occasion, again display that lust of domination, which hath rent
in twain the mighty empire of Britain.

"Upon the whole matter, the Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, that as the
Americans united in this arduous contest upon principles of common interest, for the defence
of common rights and privileges, which union hath been cemented by common calamities, and by
mutual good offices and and [sic] affection, so the great cause for which they contend, and
in which all mankind are interested, must derive its success from the continuance of that union.
Wherefore any man or body of men, who should presume to make any seperate or partial convention
or agreement with Commissioners under the Crown of Great Britain, or any of them, ought to
be considered and treated as open and avowed enemies of these United States.

"And further your Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion, That these united States
cannot, with propriety, hold any conference or treaty with any Commissioners on the part of
Great Britain, unless they shall, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and
admirals, or else, in positive and express terms, acknowledge the Independence of the said States.

"And inasmuch as it appears to be the design of the enemies of these States to lull them into
a fatal security--to the end that they may act with a, becoming weight and importance, it is
the opinion of your Committee That the several States be called upon to use the most strenuous
exertions to have their respective quotas of continental troops in the field as soon as possible,
and that all the militia of the said States be held in readiness, to act as occasion may require."

The following is the answer of Congress to the second application of the Commissioners.

    SIR,

    York-Town, June 6, 1778.

    "I HAVE had the honour of laying your letter of the 3d instant,
    with the acts of the British Parliament which came inclosed,
    before Congress; and I am instructed to acquaint you, Sir, that
    they have already expressed their sentiments upon bills, not
    essentially different from those acts, in a publication of the
    22d of April last.

    "Be assured, Sir, when the King of Great Britain shall be
    seriously disposed to put an end to the unprovoked and cruel war
    waged against these United States, Congress will readily attend
    to such terms of peace, as may consist with the honour of
    independent nations, the interest of their constituents, and the
    sacred regard they mean to pay to treaties. I have the honour to
    be, Sir,

    Your most obedient, and
    most humble servant,
    HENRY LAURENS,
    President of Congress."

    His Excellency,
    Sir Henry Clinton, K.B., Philad.

Though I am not surprised to see the Abbe mistaken in matters of history, acted at so great
a distance from his sphere of immediate observation, yet I am more than surprised to find him
wrong, (or at least what appears so to me) in the well-enlightened field of philosophical reflection. 

Babuca met since it was Scythian and sent by a genius, but if time stopped in Persepolis, Teona
would make him forget Ituriel. Affection took the city whose neighbors were friendly, courteous
and beneficial, but gossips, frivolous and vain. He feared it was doomed and Persepolis, and even
feared the bill that would give. So to give it did the following: statutory command to the best
of people, who founded a small statue, made of all metals, and land and most precious stones and
more vile, and it took Ituriel. ? You will make pieces, said to him, this beautiful statue, it is not
all gold and diamonds? Ituriel comprehended the emblem, and was determined not to seek to amend or even
to Persepolis, and dexar that walked the world as it goes, "If all is not well, at least everything
is tolerable. Persisted as Persepolis, and Babuca was far from complaining, as did Jonas is angry
because it was not destroyed Nineveh. True, who has spent three days in the belly of a whale,
do not spend such a good mood as he has been in the works, in comedy, and has fine dining with people
deal. End Babuca vision.

* * * * * Memnon, or sanity HUMAN.

       

He placed on the head one day Memnon the wrongheaded idea of ââbeing
completely sane, that few men there who has not crossed my mind like
crazy.

Memnon went thus: To be very sane and very happy consequeencia, simply
drag dexarse ââno passions: something very easy, as everyone knows.

First, I will never love any woman, and in dire finished watching
a beauty inside me: One day is the face wrinkling, plump and round
the chest has to turn soft and straight, the head is well populated
to stay bald, and I just look at now as I see then, that pretty head
that does not make me lose mine.

Secondly, I will always be sober, but I tempted by the candy, exquisite wines, and the incentive
of society. I is listed the result of gluttony, the charged head, stomach upset, loss of reason,
health and time, and so only eat what they need, I will enjoy sound health, and will always clear
and bright ideas. This thing is so easy, it is not worthwhile to get away with it. Then continued
Memnon, one must not neglect their flow: my desires are moderate, I have my money I produce good yields
and good bonds held by the treasurer general of Nineveh, and I need to live without depending
on anyone, which is the more fortunate, because I never see you in
the cruel precision of going to kiss the hands of courtiers, no one
will envy, and no one I'll be envied, if not more easy.

I have friends, he said finally, and he remains, because never makes bad third; not ever be angry
with me, nor I with them: this is offered not in difficulty. Formed so its planecico of moderation

France, on the other hand, was situated very differently to America. She was not acted upon
by necessity to seek a friend, and therefore her motive in becoming one, has the strongest
evidence of being good, and that which is so, must have some happiness for its object. With
regard to herself she saw a train of conveniencies worthy her attention. By lessening the power
of an enemy, whom, at the same time, she sought neither to destroy nor distress, she gained
an advantage without doing an evil, and created to herself a new friend by associating with
a country in misfortune. The springs of thought that lead to actions of this kind, however
political they may be, are nevertheless naturally beneficent; for in all causes, good or bad,
it is necessary there should be a fitness in the mind, to enable it to act in character with
the object: Therefore, as a bad cause cannot be prosecuted with a good motive, so neither can
a good cause be long supported by a bad one, as no man acts without a motive; therefore, in
the present instance, as they cannot be bad, they must be admitted to be good. But the Abbe
sets out upon such an extended scale, that he overlooks the degrees by which it is measured,
and rejects the beginning of good, because the end comes not at once.

It is true that bad motives may in some degree be brought to support a good cause or prosecute
a good object; but it never continues long, which is not the case with France; for either the
object will reform the mind, or the mind corrupt the object, or else not being able, either
way, to get into unison, they will separate in disgust: And this natural, though unperceived
progress of association or contention between the mind and the object, is the secret cause
of fidelity or defection. Every object a man pursues is, for the time, a kind of mistress to
his mind: if both are good or bad, the union is natural; but if they are in reverse, and neither
can seduce nor yet reform the other, the opposition grows into dislike, and a separation follows.

When the cause of America first made her appearance on the stage of the universe, there were
many who, in the style of adventurers and fortune-hunters, were dangling in her train, and
making their court to her with every profession of honour and attachment. They were loud in
her praise, and ostentatious in her service. Every place echoed with their ardour or their
anger, and they seemed like men in love.--But, alas, they were fortune-hunters. Their expectations
were excited, but their minds were unimpressed; and finding her not to the purpose, nor themselves
reformed by her influence, they ceased their suit, and in some instances deserted and betrayed her.

There were others, who at first beheld her with indifference, and unacquainted with her character,
were cautious of her company. They treated her as one, who, under the fair name of liberty,
might conceal the hideous figure of anarchy, or the gloomy monster of tyranny. They knew not
what she was. If fair, she was fair indeed. But still she was suspected, and though born among
us, appeared to be a stranger.

Accident, with some, and curiosity with others, brought on a distant acquaintance. They ventured
to look at her. They felt an inclination to speak to her. One intimacy led to another, till
the suspicion wore away, and a change of sentiment stole gradually upon the mind; and having
no self-interest to serve, no passion of dishonour to gratify, they became enamoured of her
innocence, and unaltered by misfortune or uninflamed by success, shared with fidelity in the
varieties of her fate.

This declaration of the Abbe's, respecting motives, has led me unintendedly into a train of
metaphysical reasoning; but there was no other avenue by which it could so properly be approached.

It is an observation I have already made in some former publication, that the circle of civilization
is yet incomplete. A mutuality of wants have formed the individuals of each country into a
kind of national society, and here the progress of civilization has stopt. For it is easy to
see, that nations with regard to each other (notwithstanding the ideal civil law, which every
one explains as it suits him) are like individuals in a state of nature. They are regulated
by no fixt principle, governed by no compulsive law, and each does independently what it pleases,
or what it can.

Were it possible we could have known the world when in a state of barbarism, we might have
concluded, that it never could be brought into the order we now see it. The untamed mind was
then as hard, if not harder to work upon in its individual state, than the national mind is
in its present one. Yet we have seen the accomplishment of the one, why then should we doubt
that of the other?

There is a greater fitness in mankind to extend and complete the civilization of nations with
each other at this day, than there was to begin it with the unconnected individuals at first;
in the same manner that it is somewhat easier to put together the materials of a machine after
they are formed, than it was to form them from original matter. The present condition of the
world, differing so exceedingly from what it formerly was, has given a new cast to the mind
of man, more than what he appears to be sensible of. The wants of the individual, which first
produced the idea of society, are now augmented into the wants of the nation, and he is obliged
to seek from another country what before he sought from the next person.

Letters, the tongue of the world, have in some measure brought all mankind acquainted, and,
by an extension of their uses, are every day promoting some new friendship. Through them distant
nations became capable of conversation, and losing by degrees the awkwardness of strangers,
and the moroseness of suspicion, they learn to know and understand each other. Science, the
partizan of no country, but the beneficent patroness of all, has liberally opened a temple
where all may meet. Her influence on the mind, like the sun on the chilled earth, has long
been preparing it for higher cultivation and further improvement. The philosopher of one country
sees not an enemy in the philosopher of another: he takes his seat in the temple of science,
and asks not who sits beside him.

This was not the condition of the barbarian world. Then the wants of man were few, and the
objects within his reach. While he could acquire these, he lived in a state of individual independence;
the consequence of which was, there were as many nations as persons, each contending with the
other, to secure something which he had, or to obtain something which he had not. The world
had then no business to follow, no studies to exercise the mind. Their time was divided between
sloth and fatigue. Hunting and war were their chief occupations; sleep and food their principal
enjoyments.

Now it is otherwise. A change in the mode of life has made it necessary to be busy; and man
finds a thousand things to do now which before he did not. Instead of placing his ideas of
greatness in the rude achievements of the savage, he studies arts, science, agriculture, and
commerce, the refinements of the gentleman, the principles of society, and the knowledge of
the philosopher.

There are many things which in themselves are morally neither good nor bad, but they are productive
of consequences, which are strongly marked with one or other of these characters. Thus commerce,
though in itself a moral nullity, has had a considerable influence in tempering the human mind.
It was the want of objects in the ancient world, which occasioned in them such a rude and perpetual
turn for war. Their time hung upon their hands without the means of employment. The indolence
they lived in afforded leisure for mischief, and being all idle at once, and equal in their
circumstances, they were easily provoked or induced to action.

But the introduction of commerce furnished the world with objects, which in their extent, reach
every man, and give him something to think about and something to do; by these his attention
his [sic] mechanically drawn from the pursuits which a state of indolence and an unemployed
mind occasioned, and he trades with the same countries, which former ages, tempted by their
productions, and too indolent to purchase them, would have gone to war with.

Thus, as I have already observed, the condition of the world being materially changed by the
influence of science and commerce, it is put into a fitness not only to admit of, but to desire
an extension of civilization. The principal and almost only remaining enemy it now has to encounter,
is prejudice; for it is evidently the interest of mankind to agree and make the best of life.
The world has undergone its divisions of empire, the several boundaries of which are known
and settled. The idea of conquering countries, like the Greeks and Romans, does not now exist;
and experience has exploded the notion of going to war for the sake of profit. In short, the
objects for war are exceedingly diminished, and there is now left scarcely any thing to quarrel
about, but what arises from that demon of society, prejudice, and the consequent sullenness
and untractableness of the temper.

There is something exceedingly curious in the constitution and operation of prejudice. It has
the singular ability of accommodating itself to all the possible varieties of the human mind.
Some passions and vices are but thinly scattered among mankind, and find only here and there
a fitness of reception. But prejudice, like the spider, makes every where its home. It has
neither taste nor choice of place, and all that it requires is room. There is scarcely a situation,
except fire or water, in which a spider will not live. So, let the mind be as naked as the
walls of an empty and forsaken tenement, gloomy as a dungeon, or ornamented with the richest
abilities of thinking; let it be hot, cold, dark, or light, lonely or inhabited, still prejudice,
if undisturbed, will fill it with cobwebs, and live, like the spider, where there seems nothing
to live on. If the one prepares her food by poisoning it to her palate and her use, the other
does the same; and as several of our passions are strongly charactered by the animal world,
prejudice may be denominated the spider of the mind.

Perhaps no two events ever united so intimately and forceably to combat and expel prejudice,
as the Revolution of America, and the Alliance with France. Their effects are felt, and their
influence already extends as well to the old world as the new. Our style and manner of thinking
have undergone a revolution, more extraordinary than the political revolution of the country.
We see with other eyes; we hear with other ears; and think with other thoughts, than those
we formerly used. We can look back on our own prejudices, as if they had been the prejudices
of other people. We now see and know they were prejudices, and nothing else; and relieved from
their shackles, enjoy a freedom of mind we felt not before. It was not all the argument, however
powerful, nor all the reasoning, however elegant, that could have produced this change, so
necessary to the extension of the mind and the cordiality of the world, without the two circumstances
of the Revolution and the Alliance.

Had America dropt quietly from Britain, no material change in sentiment had taken place. The
same notions, prejudices, and conceits, would have governed in both countries, as governed
them before; and, still the slaves of error and education, they would have travelled on in
the beaten tract of vulgar and habitual thinking. But brought about by the means it has been,
both with regard to ourselves, to France, and to England, every corner of the mind is swept
of its cobwebs, poison, and dust, and made fit for the reception of general happiness.

Perhaps there never was an alliance on a broader basis, than that between America and France,
and the progress of it is worth attending to. The countries had been enemies, not properly
of themselves, but through the medium of England. They, originally, had no quarrel with each
other, nor any cause for one, but what arose from the interest of England, and her arming America
against France. At the same time, the Americans, at a distance from and unacquainted with the
world, and tutored in all the prejudices which governed those who governed them, conceived
it their duty to act as they were taught. In doing this they expended their substance to make
conquests, not for themselves, but for their masters, who in return, treated them as slaves.

A long succession of insolent severity, and the separation finally occasioned by the commencement
of hostilities at Lexington, on the 19th of April, 1775, naturally produced a new disposition
of thinking. As the mind closed itself towards England, it opened itself toward the world;
and our prejudices, like our oppressions, underwent, though less observed, a mental examination;
until we found the former as inconsistent with reason and benevolence, as the latter were repugnant
to our civil and political rights. That must be wonderful .... We entered, and a world of pomp and harmony,
memories and solemn nature of the ruins and animation, offered to
our eyes.

I had no idea, unless the Colombian jungle than a luxury similar vegetation. From the door
inwards, in an extension of several hundred meters, lies a lush forest of old trees, under
whose shade canopy is absolute. This forest is divided into several streets magnificent macadamized
whose sides run and jump clear that flows to form a delightful music. There is a ray of sunlight
penetrates under those domes where the sacred genius loose a race, an entire civilization disappeared
.... On the right, between the halls of ivy and elm trees and colossal walls and towers stand inside
the fortified line that separates itself from the Alhambra gardens much of the city. On the left,
extending to fifth (including the very famous for a rich banker, Mr. Calderon), surrounded by orchards and gardens
cÃ¡rmenes or if it has what is most delicate and beautiful, aromatic and voluptuous vegetation Andalusia.
That paradise of scents, shadows, vegetables and harmony is inhabited by hundreds of nightingales
hiss slowly when approaching night. She wants to live there many years in a relentless collection
of love, contemplation and poetry .... It passed under the portico of the city, leaving the city
forest of mysterious harmonies and the traveler is in the vast courtyard of the tanks. The center cavity
is huge underground reservoirs: South Alcazaba tower and platforms
of Prisons, and later Vela high tower, north of Summer Palace to the
right, a wide street to the left, leading the city or town, and the
center of the palace of Charles V, massive and noble tasks ruin a
small part of the site to cover the Winter Palace of the Moorish kings.

Whenever giant rubble, misery and sorrow, - skeleton colossal military and artistic miracle of
civilization .... Go up the stairs of the building walls Prison break bleak dusty steps resonate
abroad granite mass of brick and hard, producing echoes that appear to be hidden under the cries
of the victims crowded houses for huge.
 France has been
in alliance with the republic of Switzerland for more than two hundred years, and still Switzerland
retains her original form as entire as if she had allied with a republic like herself; therefore
this remark of the Abbe should go for nothing.--Besides, it is best mankind should mix. There
is ever something to learn, either of manners or principle; and it is by a free communication,
without regard to domestic matters, that friendship is to be extended, and prejudice destroyed
all over the world.

But notwithstanding the Abbe's high professions in favour of liberty, he appears sometimes
to forget himself, or that his theory is rather the child of his fancy than of his judgment:
for in almost the same instant that he censures the alliance, as not originally or sufficiently
calculated for the happiness of mankind, he, by a figure of implication, accuses France for
having acted so generously and unreservedly in concluding it. "Why did they (says he, meaning
the Court of France) tie themselves down by an inconsiderate treaty to conditions with the
Congress, which they might themselves have held in dependence by ample and regular supplies."

When an author undertakes to treat of public happiness, he ought to be certain that he does
not mistake passion for right, nor imagination for principle. Principle, like truth, needs
no contrivance. It will ever tell its own tale, and tell it the same way. But where this is
not the case, every page must be watched, recollected, and compared like an invented story.

I am surprised at this passage of the Abbe. It means nothing or it means ill; and in any case
it shows the great difference between speculative and practical knowledge. A treaty according
to the Abbe's language would have neither duration nor affection; it might have lasted to the
end of the war, and then expired with it.--But France, by acting in a style superior to the
little politics of narrow thinking, has established a generous fame, and won the love of a
country she was before a stranger to. She had to treat with a people who thought as nature
taught them; and, on her own part, she wisely saw there was no present advantage to be obtained
by unequal terms, which could balance the more lasting ones that might flow from a kind and
generous beginning.

From this part the Abbe advances into the secret transactions of the two Cabinets of Versailles
and Madrid, respecting the independence of America, through which I mean not to follow him.
It is a circumstance sufficiently striking, without being commented on, that the former union
of America with Britain, produced a power, which, in her hands, had was becoming dangerous
to the world: and there is no improbability in supposing, that had the latter known as much
of the strength of former, before she began the quarrel, as she has known since, that instead
of attempting to reduce her to unconditional submission, would have proposed to her the conquest
of Mexico. But from the countries separately, Spain has nothing to apprehend, though from their
union, she had more to fear than any other power in Europe.

The part which I shall more particularly confine myself to, is that, wherein the Abbe takes
an opportunity of complimenting the British Ministry with high encomiums of admiration, on
their rejecting the offered mediation of the Court of Madrid, in 1779.

It must be remembered, that before Spain joined France in the War, she undertook the office
of a mediator, and made proposals to the British King and Ministry so exceedingly favourable
to their interest, that had they been accepted, would have become inconvenient, if not inadmissible
to America. These proposals were nevertheless rejected by the British Cabinet: on which the
Abbe says,--

"It is in such a circumstance as this, it is in the time when noble pride elevates the soul
superior to all terror; when nothing is seen more dreadful than the shame of receiving the
law, and when there is no doubt or hesitation which to chuse, between ruin and dishonour; it
is then, that the greatness of a nation is displayed. I acknowledge, however, that men accustomed
to judge of things by the event, call great and perilous resolutions, heroism or madness, according
to the good or bad success with which they have been attended. If then I should be asked, what
is the name which shall in years to come be given to the firmness, which was in this moment
exhibited by the English, I shall answer, that I do not know. But that which it deserves I
know. I know that the annals of the world hold out to us but rarely the august and majestic
spectacle of a nation, which chuses rather to renounce its duration than its glory."

In this paragraph the conception is lofty, and the expression elegant; but the colouring is
too high for the original, and the likeness fails through an excess of graces. To fit the powers
of thinking and the turn of language to the subject, so as to bring out a clear conclusion
that shall hit the point in question, and nothing else, is the true criterion of writing. But
the greater part of the Abbe's writings (if he will pardon me the remark) appear to me uncentral
and burthened with variety. They represent a beautiful wilderness without paths; in which the
eye is diverted by every thing, without being particularly directed to any thing: and in which
it is agreeable to be lost, and difficult to find the way out.

Before I offer any other remark oh the spirit and composition of the above passage, I shall
compare it with the circumstance it alludes to.

The circumstance, then, does not deserve the encomium. The rejection was not prompted by her
fortitude but her vanity. She did not view it as a case of despair or even of extreme danger,
and consequently the determination to renounce her duration rather than her glory, cannot apply
to the condition of her mind. She had then high expectations of subjugating America, and had
no other naval force against her than France; neither was she certain that rejecting the mediation
of Spain would combine that power with France. New mediations might arise more favourable than
those she had refused. But if they should not, and Spain should join, she still saw that it
would only bring out her naval force against France and Spain, which was wanted and could not
be employed against America, and habits of thinking had taught her to believe herself superior
to both.

But in any case to which the consequence might point, there was nothing to impress her with
the idea of renouncing her duration. It is not the policy of Europe to suffer the extinction
of any power, but only to lop off, or prevent its dangerous encrease. She was likewise freed
by situation from the internal and immediate horrors of invasion; was rolling in dissipation,
and looking for conquests; and though she suffered nothing but the expense of war, she still
had a greedy eye to magnificent reimbursement.

But if the Abbe is delighted with high and striking singularities of character he might, in
America, have found ample field for encomium. Here was a people, who could not know what part
the world would take for, or against them; and who were venturing on an untried scheme, in
opposition to a power, against which more formidable nations had failed. They had every thing
to learn but the principles which supported them, and every thing to procure that was necessary
for their defense. They have at times seen themselves as low as distress could make them, without
showing the least stagger in their fortitude; and been raised again by the most unexpected
events, without discovering an unmanly discomposure of joy. To hesitate or to despair are conditions
equally unknown in America. Her mind was prepared for every thing; because her original and
final resolution of succeeding or perishing included all possible circumstances.

The rejection of the British propositions in the year 1778, circumstanced as America was at
that time, is a far greater instance of unshaken fortitude than the refusal of the Spanish
mediation by the Court of London: and other historians, besides the Abbe, struck with the vastness
of her conduct therein, have, like himself, attributed it to a circumstance which was then
unknown, the alliance with France. Their error shows their idea of its greatness; because,
in order to account for it, they have sought a cause suited to its magnitude, without knowing
that the cause existed in the principles of the country.[2]

Register for the year 1780.

    "THE Commissioners, who, in consequence of Lord North's
    conciliatory bills, went over to America, to propose terms of
    peace to the colonies, were wholly unsuccessful. Pray draw the attention of precious jewels, lace, the exquisite
fans, plaster and wood sculptures, beautiful bands, capricious leggings, blankets, coats and jackets
or coats for popular use, the harness rare, pellon of frames, the beautiful tapestries and
sandals anyway, now cares one to observe the Indian-made weapons from the microscopic to nearly
razor the great Moorish dagger, a sword of Toledo and the fabulous style and fearsome knife
three quarters length frightening for both ends. Everything is there, curious, in terms that he feels
the temptation to buy everything to keep Andalusian museum. As for me, impressions were so vivid
that I keep my museum in memory. Sevilla has left me so vividly recorded in the mind as if it
had been there a long time.

Impossible I would make a detailed description of the business and artistic treasures that
is Sevilla. A residence of five days was not enough for a neat observation, and though it was,
I am not able to speak properly for fine arts. Out very pass my most vivid impressions.

Since then, the cathedral is the great wonder of the Andalusian metropolis. It is an enormous
mass stone, Gothic fifteenth century, almost entirely, because the back is Renaissance, completed
much later, - a circumstance that produces a disagreeable contrast. The church has no tower and
main façade is incomplete, lacking major busts and ornaments of their own time. Completed slowly
over a long course of time, appears on the outside as a monument dislocated, however the majesty
and boldness their bows and air strongholds that seem to make a silent invocation to heaven.
Greatness the cathedral (the first in Spain without dispute, in some respects) is in the interior.
Such is his wealth of marble, its single large tile flooring black and white has cost the large
sum of 125.000 dollars. It measures a total length (with prolongation of the royal chapel)
of 417 feet, 315, latitude and elevation, starting 53 feet in hoods rises to 104 in the aisles,
to 145 in the main and to 171 in the dome or dome that dominates. As seen, the proportions
are colossal.

Its five vast warehouses are imposing majesty, especially central, whose admirable handcrafted stone
columns resting on numerous formidable and daring is a lightness and remarkable courage. Ninety-three
windows ogival windows (by the century XVI) is beautiful for its fineness and color, and the
choir stalls is one of the richest and best work I've seen in the Gothic cathedrals. The frescoes
of the dome are beautiful, like the exquisite work of monumental gates that enclose the choir.
Can be considered contain many beauties of art that cathedral, just know that she has worked on
one hundred ninety-six notable artists, some of them eminent and first order. And However, by some strange
neglect, ignore the name of the architect to draw the plan such a great monument.

If the two colossal bodies are superb in every way, and the walls,
small chapels and vaults have a hundred beauties to admire, to penetrate
to the royal chapel and the chapter house (Making a sudden transition
from the gloomy solemnity of the Gothic to the flowery creations Greco-Roman
art) are beauties of sculpture and paintings and reliefs and works
delicate architecture that are of great merit.

There is revealed in works immortal genius Murillo, Herrera and other great masters, alongside much
higher sculptors. In the royal chapel worship the statue of Ferdinand the Catholic and are among
other notable graves Don Alonso the sage and his mother Dona Beatriz.
 I mean the want of attachment to her allies,
or rejoicing in their disasters. She, it is true, has been assiduous in showing to the world
that she was not the aggressor toward England; and that the quarrel was not of her seeking,
or, at that time, even of her wishing. But to draw inferences from her justification, to stab
her character by, and I see nothing else from which they can be supposed to be drawn, is unkind
and unjust.

Does her rejection of the British propositions in 1778, before she knew of any alliance with
France, correspond with the Abbe's description of her mind? Does a single instance of her conduct
since that time justify it?--But there is a still better evidence to apply to, which is, that
of all the mails which at different times have been way-laid on the road, in divers parts of
America, and taken and carried into New-York, and from which the most secret and confidential
private letters, as well as those from authority, have been published, not one of them, I repeat
it, not a single one of them, gives countenance to such a charge.

This is not a country where men are under government restraint in speaking; and if there is
any kind of restraint, it arises from a fear of popular resentment. Now, if nothing in her
private or public correspondence favours such a suggestion, and if the general disposition
of the country is such as to make it unsafe for a man to shew an appearance of joy at any disaster
to her ally; on what grounds, I ask, can the accusation stand? What company the Abbe may have
kept in France, we cannot know; but this we know, that the account he gives does not apply
to America.

Had the Abbe been in America at the time the news arrived of the disaster of the fleet under
Count de Grasse, in the West-Indies, he would have seen his vast mistake. Neither do I remember
any instance, except the loss of Charlestown, in which the public mind suffered more severe
and pungent concern, or underwent more agitations of hope and apprehension, as to the truth
or falsehood of the report. Had the loss been all our own, it could not have had a deeper effect;
yet it was not one of those cases which reached to the independence of America.

In the geographical account which the Abbe gives of the Thirteen States, he is so exceedingly
erroneous, that to attempt a particular refutation, would exceed the limits I have prescribed
to myself. And as it is a matter neither political, historical, nor sentimental, and which
can always be contradicted by the extent and natural circumstances of the country, I shall
pass it over; with this additional remark, that I never yet saw an European description of
America that was true, neither can any person gain a just idea of it, but by coming to it.

Though I have already extended this letter beyond what I at first proposed, I am, nevertheless,
obliged to omit many observations I originally designed to have made. I wish there had been
no occasion for making any. But the wrong ideas which the Abbe's work had a tendency to excite,
and the prejudicial impressions they might make, must be an apology for my remarks, and the
freedom with which they are made.

I observe the Abbe has made a sort of epitome of a considerable part of the pamphlet Common
Sense, and introduced it in that form into his publication. But there are other places where
the Abbe has borrowed freely from the said pamphlet without acknowledging it. The difference
between society and government, with which the pamphlet opens, is taken from it, and in some
expressions almost literally, into the Abbe's work, as if originally his own; and through the
whole of the Abbe's remarks on this head, the idea in Common Sense is so closely copied and
pursued, that the difference is only in words, and in the arrangement of the thoughts, and
not in the thoughts themselves.[3]

remissness will point out the necessity of establishing some form of moral virtue."

But as it is time that I should come to the end of my letter, I shall forbear all further observations
on the Abbe's work, and take a concise view of the state of public affairs, since the time
in which that performance was published.

A mind habituated to actions of meanness and injustice, commits them without reflection, or
with a very partial one; for on what other ground than this, can we account for the declaration
of war against the Dutch? To gain an idea of the politics which actuated the British Ministry
to this measure, we must enter into the opinion which they, and the English in general, had
formed of the temper of the Dutch nation; and from thence infer what their expectation of the
consequences would be.

Could they have imagined that Holland would have seriously made a common cause with France,
Spain and America, the British Ministry would never have dared to provoke them. It would have
been a madness in politics to have done so; unless their views were to hasten on a period of
such emphatic distress, as should justify the concessions which they saw they must one day
or other make to the world, and for which they wanted an apology to themselves.--There is a
temper in some men which seeks a pretense for submission. Like a ship disabled in action, and
unfitted to continue it, it waits the approach of a still larger one to strike to, and feels
relief at the opportunity. Whether this is greatness or littleness of mind, I am not enquiring
into. I should suppose it to be the latter, because it proceeds from the want of knowing how
to bear misfortune in its original state.

But the subsequent conduct of the British cabinet has shown that this was not their plan of
politics, and consequently their motives must be sought for in another line.

The truth is, that the British had formed a very humble opinion of the Dutch nation. They looked
on them as a people who would submit to any thing; that they might insult them as they liked,
plunder them as they pleased, and still the Dutch dared not to be provoked.

If this be taken as the opinion of the British cabinet, the measure is easily accounted for,
because it goes on the supposition, that when, by a declaration of hostilities, they had robbed
the Dutch of some millions sterling (and to rob them was popular), they could make peace with
them again whenever they pleased, and on almost any terms the British ministry should propose.
And no sooner was the plundering committed, than the accommodation was set on foot, and failed.

When once the mind loses the sense of its own dignity, it loses, likewise, the ability of judging
of it in another. And the American war has thrown Britain into such a variety of absurd situations,
that, arguing from herself, she sees not in what conduct national dignity consists in other
countries. From Holland she expected duplicity and submission, and this mistake from her having
acted, in a number of instances during the present war, the same character herself.

To be allied to, or connected with Britain, seems to be an unsafe and impolitic situation.
Holland and America are instances of the reality of this remark. Make those countries the allies
of France or Spain, and Britain will court them with civility and treat them with respect;
make them her own allies, and she will insult and plunder them. In the first case, she feels
some apprehensions at offending them, because they have support at hand; in the latter, those
apprehensions do not exist. Such, however, has hitherto been her conduct.

Another measure which has taken place since the publication of the Abbe's work, and likewise
since the time of my beginning this letter, is the change in the British Ministry. What line
the new cabinet will pursue respecting America, is at this time unknown; neither is it very
material, unless they are seriously disposed to a general and honourable peace.

Repeated experience has shown, not only the impracticability of conquering America, but the
still higher impossibility of conquering her mind, or recalling her back to her former condition
of thinking. Since the commencement of the war, which is now approaching to eight years, thousands
and tens of thousands have advanced, and are daily advancing into the first state of manhood,
who know nothing of Britain but as a barbarous enemy, and to whom the independence of America
appears as much the natural and established government of the country, as that of England does
to an Englishman. And on the other hand, thousands of the aged, who had British ideas, have
dropped and are daily dropping, from the stage of business and life.--The natural progress
of generation and decay operates every hour to the disadvantage of Britain. Time and death,
hard enemies to contend with, fight constantly against her interest; and the bills of mortality,
in every part of America, are the thermometers of her decline. The children in the streets
are from their cradle bred to consider her as their only foe. In each street,
every corner, every doorway or wall, balcony or window, you see some precious object to the
antiquarian, surprising for the traveler who goes first as a city special like that. Here there
is a beautiful mosaic piece, a beautiful marble tile, a rare bust of stone or a historical inscription;
there with ogival window, a balcony Moorish, an unusual viewpoint, a Gothic turret or a lamentable
debris. Toledo is the cemetery magnificent two civilizations, two races, each building is a tomb
and each door or wall contains an epitaph ....

We hasten to speak of that wonderful bygone quickly called the Fortress, for end with the monumental
and show the reader some features of the social physiognomy of Toledo. This remarkable ruin is
situated on the eastern side of the city on a hill overlooking while the depths to Toledo and
the Tagus. The foundations and different bodies and Alcazar facades dating from very different
eras. Founded in the same place a fortress Roman, Gothic and immediately after Arabic, the
conqueror of Toledo, Alfonso VI, several times mentioned, gave more great ways, governor of
the castle doing nothing less than the Cid heroic. Many kings improved on the famous fortress,
until Charles V decided to demolish almost all buildings over, keeping only a facade Gothic cellars
and formidable foundation. Felipe II finished the work, invested in her fifty years that have
passed from 1534 to 1584, and worked there the most eminent artists as Villalpando, Covarrubias
and Juan de Herrera. In 1710 was burnt the palace-fortress admirable by Allied troops who fought against
Philip V in the war of succession.


It has apparently been the fault of many in the late minority, to suppose that America would
agree to certain terms with them, were they in place, which she would not ever listen to, from
the then administration. This idea can answer no other purpose than to prolong the war; and
Britain may, at the expense of many more millions, learn the fatality of such mistakes. If
the new ministry wisely avoid this hopeless policy, they will prove themselves better pilots
and wiser men than they are conceived to be; for it is every day expected to see their bark
strike upon some hidden rock, and go to pieces.

But there is a line in which they may be great. A more brilliant opening needs not to present
itself; and it is such an one as true magnanimity would improve, and humanity rejoice in.

A total reformation is wanted in England. She wants an expanded mind,--an heart which embraces
the universe. Instead of shutting herself up in an island, and quarreling with the world, she
would derive more lasting happiness, and acquire more real riches by generously mixing with
it, and bravely saying, I am the enemy of none. It is not now the time for little contrivances,
or artful politics. The European world is too experienced to be imposed upon, and America too
wise to be duped. It must be something new and masterly that must succeed. The idea of seducing
America from her independence, or of corrupting her from her alliance is a thought too little
for a great mind, and impossible for any honest one, to attempt. When ever politics are applied
to debauch mankind from their integrity, and dissolve the virtues of human nature, they become
detestables and to be a statesman on this plan, is to be a commissioned villain. He who aims
at it, leaves a vacancy in his character, which may be filled up with the worst of epithets.

If the disposition of England should be such, as not to agree to a general and honourable peace,
and the war must at all events, continue longer, I cannot help wishing that the alliances which
America has or may enter into, may become the only objects of the war. She wants an opportunity
of shewing to the world that she holds her honour as dear and sacred as her independence, and
that she will in no situation forsake those, whom no negotiations could induce to forsake her.
Peace, to every reflective mind is a desirable object; but that peace which is accompanied
with a ruined character, becomes a crime to the seducer, and a curse upon the seduced.

But where is the impossibility or even the great difficulty of England forming a friendship
with France and Spain, and making it a national virtue to renounce for ever those prejudiced
inveteracies it has been her custom to cherish; and which, while they serve to sink her with
an increasing enormity of debt, by involving her in fruitless wars, become likewise the bane
of her repose, and the destruction of her manners. He
has a habit of coming to our box when in the theater and stays for one act and perhaps the intermission
before and after. He behaves pleasantly while there and is not offensive in his person and causes
Mother to laugh. Whose mind rises above the Atmospheres of local thoughts, and considers mankind, of
whatever nation or profession they may be, as the work of one Creator. The rage for conquest
has had its fashion, and its day. Why may not the amiable virtues have the same? The Alexanders
and Cæsars of antiquity have left behind them their monuments of destruction, and are remembered
with hatred; while those more exalted characters, who first taught society and science, are
blessed with the gratitude of every age and country. Of more use was one philosopher, though
a heathen, to the world, than all the heathen conquerors that ever existed.

Should the present revolution be distinguished by opening a new system of extended civilization,
it will receive from heaven the highest evidence of approbation; and as this is a subject to
which the Abbe's powers are so eminently suited, I recommend it to his attention, with the
affection of a friend, and the ardour of a universal citizen.

POSTSCRIPT

Since closing the foregoing letter some intimations respecting a general peace, have made their
way to America. On what authority or foundation they stand, or how near or remote such an event
may be, are circumstances I am not enquiring into. But as the subject must sooner or later,
become a matter of serious attention, it may not be improper, even at this early period, candidly
to investigate some points that are connected with it, or lead towards it.

The independence of America is at this moment as firmly established as that of any other country
in a state of war. It is not length of time, but power that gives stability. Nations at war
know nothing of each other on the score of antiquity. It is their present and immediate strength,
together with their connections, that must support them. To which we may add, that a right
which originated to-day, is as much a right, as if it had the sanction of a thousand years;
and therefore the independence and present government of America are in no more danger of being
subverted, because they are modern, than that of England is secure, because it is ancient.

The politics of Britain, so far as respected America, were originally conceived in idiotism,
and acted in madness. There is not a step which bears the smallest trace of rationality. In
her management of the war, she has laboured to be wretched, and studied to be hated; and in
all her former propositions for accommodation, she has discovered a total ignorance of mankind,
and of those natural and unalterable sensations by which they are so generally governed. How
she may conduct herself in the present or future business of negotiating a peace is yet to
be proved.

He is a weak politician who does not understand human nature, and penetrate into the effect
which measures of government will have upon the mind. All the miscarriages of Britain have
arisen from this defect. The former Ministry acted as if they supposed mankind to be without
a mind; and the present Ministry, as if America was without a memory. The one must have supposed
we were incapable of feeling; and the other that we could not remember injuries.

There is likewise another line in which politicians mistake, which is that of not rightly calculating,
or rather of misjudging, the consequence which any given circumstance will produce. Nothing
is more frequent, as well in common as in political life, than to hear people complain, that
such or such means produced an event directly contrary to their intentions. But the fault lies
in their not judging rightly what the event would be; for the means produced only its proper
and natural consequence.

It is very probable, that in a treaty of peace, Britain will contend for some post or other
in North America, perhaps Canada or Halifax, or both; and I infer this from the known deficiency
of her politics, which have ever yet made use of means, whose natural event was against both
her interest and her expectation. But the question with her ought to be, Whether it is worth
her while to hold them, and what will be the consequence?

Respecting Canada, one or other of the two following will take place, viz. If Canada should
people, it will revolt, and if it do not people, it will not be worth the expense of holding.
And the same may be said of Halifax; and the country round it. But Canada never will people;
neither is there any occasion for contrivances on one side or the other, for nature alone will
do the whole.

Britain may put herself to great expenses in sending settlers to Canada; but the descendants
of those settlers will be Americans, as other descendants have been before them. They will
look round and see the neighbouring States sovereign and free, respected abroad, and trading
at large with the world; and the natural love of liberty, the advantages of commerce, the blessings
of independence and of a happier climate, and a richer soil, will draw them southward; and
the effect will be, that Britain will sustain the expense, and America reap the advantage.

One would think that the experience which Britain has had of America, would entirely sicken
her of all thoughts of continental colonization, and any part she might retain will only become
to her a field of jealousy and thorns, of debate and contention, forever struggling for privileges,
and meditating revolt. 

I will not deny me, my dear master, that the intrigue that has paid much chacha RamonCarlos is
reprehensible, but has a very great advantage. While I was so enamored of Dona Juana and being
so in love Isabelita D. Ambrose, the four would be jeopardized if my future and I tarry here.
So we have every reason to get out of this place While we do not take the blessing of the priest,
and two so smelly escape characters such as Isabelita stepmother
and brother.

Dona Juana Dona Micaela, SISTER OF FATHER GUTIERREZ May 4.

My kind friend, for relief of my heart, I must tell you all that
has happened.

I have always been modest. Believe me I am far from pretty and seductive. And yet, I do not know what it
is, no doubt unintentionally, and even without feeling I was escaping from my eyes a fire raging inferno
insane men. I said to you the vehement and criminal passion that inspired Carratraca D. Pepito, and
how much he has asked me, tormented and persecuted comin to my town. Believe me I have not
given a reason that young man daring enough to step, or better say, for the cliff to be tossed
a few nights ago. Rondon, and without saying oste or wort, is entered into my house and my room to
attack my honesty, when my husband was absent. In what danger I found! What commitment mine and yours!
D. Gregory came when least anticipated. And because we stumbled on a bench, took a bump and let
some of the ugly expletives he usually drop. If not for this, we are surprised. The presence of
the spirit of the chacha RamonCarlos saved us from a scandal and perhaps a bloody drama. What would
become of my poor D. Gregory, as thick as it is and leaving the country in defiance? I was
just thinking about hair stands on end. Chacha, fortunately, was D. Pepito Isabel's room.
That saved us. I have been very grateful. But it is still more my gratitude for the passionate
D. Pepito, who, not committing myself, pretending that he was the boyfriend of Elizabeth, and to my
own daughter-who has renounced his love for D. Ambrose and said he was a young bride of Malaga.
 And to say that all this happens because it is besieged by land and water,
is to say nothing, for this will always be the case in time of war, while France and Spain
keep up superior fleets, and Britain holds the place.--So that, though, as an impenetrable
inaccessible rock, it may be held by the one, it is always in the power of the other to render
it useless and excessively chargeable.

I should suppose that one of the principal objects of Spain in besieging it, is to show to
Britain, that though she may not take it, she can command it, that is, she can shut it up,
and prevent its being used as a harbour, though not as a garrison.--But the short way to reduce
Gibraltar is to attack the British fleet; for Gibraltar is as dependent on a fleet for support,
as a bird is on its wing for food, and when wounded there it starves.

There is another circumstance which the people of England have not only not attended to, but
seem to be utterly ignorant of, and that is, the difference between permanent power and accidental
power, considered in a national sense.

By permanent power, I mean, a natural inherent, and perpetual ability in a nation, which though
always in being, may not be always in action, or not always advantageously directed; and by
accidental power, I mean, a fortunate or accidental disposition or exercise of national strength,
in whole or in part.

There undoubtedly was a time when any one European nation, with only eight or ten ships of
war, equal to the present ships of the line, could have carried terror to all others, who had
not begun to build a navy, however great their natural ability might be for that purpose: but
this can be considered only as accidental, and not as a standard to compare permanent power
by, and could last no longer than until those powers built as many or more ships than the former.
After this a larger fleet was necessary, in order to be superior; and a still larger would
again supersede it. And thus mankind have gone on building fleet upon fleet, as occasion or
situation dictated. And this reduces it to an original question, which is: Which power can
build and man the largest number of ships? The natural answer to which is, That power which
has the largest revenue and the greatest number of inhabitants, provided its situation of coast
affords sufficient conveniencies.

France being a nation on the continent of Europe, and Britain an island in its neighbourhood,
each of them derived different ideas from their different situations. The inhabitants of Britain
could carry on no foreign trade, nor stir from the spot they dwelt upon, without the assistance
of shipping; but this was not the case with France. The idea therefore of a navy did not arise
to France from the same original and immediate necessity which produced to England. But the
question is, that when both of them turn their attention, and employ their revenues the same
way, which can be superior?

The annual revenue of France is nearly double that of England, and her number of inhabitants
nearly twice as many. Each of them has the same length of ground on the Channel; besides which,
France has several hundred miles extent on the Bay of Biscay, and an opening on the Mediterranean:
and every day proves that practice and exercise make sailors, as well as soldiers, in one country
as well as another.

If then Britain can maintain a hundred ships of the line, France can as well support a hundred
and fifty, because her revenue and her population are as equal to the one as those of England
are to the other. And the only reason why she has not done it is because she has not till very
lately attended to it. But when she sees, as she now sees, that a navy is the first engine
of power, she can easily accomplish it.

England very falsely, and ruinously for herself, infers, that because she had the advantage
of France, while France had the smaller navy, that for that reason it is always to be so. Whereas
it may be clearly seen that the strength of France has never yet been tried on a navy, and
that she is able to be as superior to England in the extent of a navy, as she is in the extent
of her revenues and her population. And England may lament the day, when, by her insolence
and injustice, she provoked in France a maritime disposition.

It is in the power of the combined fleets to conquer every island in the West Indies, and reduce
all the British Navy in those places. For were France and Spain to send their whole naval force
in Europe to those islands, it would not be in the power of Britain to follow them with an
equal force. She would still be twenty or thirty ships inferior, were she to send every vessel
she had; and in the meantime all the foreign trade of England would lay exposed to the Dutch.

It is a maxim which, I am persuaded, will ever hold good, and more especially in naval operations,
that a great power ought never to move in detachments, if it can possibly be avoided; but to
go with its whole force to some important object, the reduction of which shall have a decisive
effect upon the war. I think the people of Seville are among the most beautiful
and rival those in Eastern Hungary and parts of Italy. The beauty found there is almost too much.
It is without the severity of the Spanish or the coolness of the
British or the artificiality-- to some degree intended-- of the French
or Valencia's harshness.

 For though she had been obliged to fly before the combined
fleets, yet Rodney has twice had the fortune to fall in with detached squadrons, to which he
was superior in numbers: The first off Cape St. Vincent, where he had nearly two to one, and
the other in the West Indies, where he had a majority of six ships. Victories of this kind
almost produce themselves. They are won without honour, and suffered without disgrace; and
are ascribable to the chance of meeting, not to the superiority of fighting: For the same Admiral,
under whom they were obtained, was unable, in three former engagements, to make the least impression
on a fleet consisting of an equal number of ships with his own, and compounded for the events
by declining the actions.[4]

To conclude: if it may be said that Britain has numerous enemies, it likewise proves that she
has given numerous offenses. Insolence is sure to provoke hatred, whether in a nation or an
individual. That want of manners in the British Court may be seen even in its birth-days and
new-years odes, which are calculated to infatuate the vulgar, and disgust the man of refinement;
and her former overbearing rudeness, and insufferable injustice on the seas, have made every
commercial nation her foe. Her fleets were employed as engines of prey; and acted on the surface
of the deep the character which the shark does beneath it.--On the other hand, the Combined
Powers are taking a popular part, and will render their reputation immortal, by establishing
the perfect freedom of the ocean, to which all countries have a right, and are interested in
accomplishing. The sea is the world's highway; and he who arrogates a prerogative over it transgresses
the right, and justly brings on himself the chastisement of nations.

Perhaps it might be of some service to the future tranquillity of mankind, were an article
were introduced into the next general peace, that no one nation should, in time of peace, exceed
a certain number of ships of war. Something of this kind seems necessary; for, according to
the present fashion, half of the world will get upon the water, and there appears to be no
end to the extent to which navies may be carried. Another reason is that navies add nothing
to the manners or morals of a people. The sequestered life which attends the service, prevents
the opportunities of society, and is too apt to occasion a coarseness of ideas and of language,
and that more in ships of war than in the commercial employ; because in the latter they mix
more with the world, and are nearer related to it. By chacha RamonCarlos, which has been connected with me, I know I want Isabelita; but is so
timid and so well ordered, my girlfriend will not be formal or write me or consent to see me
or talk to me pave a grill, as it could, not give their consent while his father and the one

her. I have insisted the chacha RamonCarlos to see if he could get me for speaking
Isabelita a fence: but Chacha explained to me that this is impossible.
 Judge then who is best able to continue it.

She has likewise many atonements to make to an injured world, as well in one quarter as in
another. And instead of pursuing that temper of arrogance, which serves only to sink her in
the esteem, and entail on her the dislike, of all nations, she would do well to reform her
manners, and retrench her expenses, live peaceably with he neighbours, and think of war no more.
