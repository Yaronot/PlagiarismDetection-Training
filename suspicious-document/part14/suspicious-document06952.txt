The doctor then declared that he could not deal with the Baron's wound unless he were the sole
occupant of the bed, and this sentence brought the first cloud of grief or dread to Friedel's
brow, but only for a moment.  He looked at his brother, who had again fainted at the first
touch of his wounded limb, and said, "It is well.  Tell the dear Ebbo that I cannot help it
if after all I go to the praying, and leave him the fighting.  Dear, dear Ebbo!  One day together
again and for ever!  I leave thee for thine own sake."  With much effort he signed the cross
again on his brother's brow, and kissed it long and fervently.  Then, as all stood round, reluctant
to effect this severance, or disturb one on whom death was visibly fast approaching, he struggled
up on his elbow, and held out the other hand, saying, "Take me now, Heinz, ere Ebbo revive
to be grieved.  The last sacrifice," he further whispered, whilst almost giving himself to
Heinz and Moritz to be carried to his own bed in the turret chamber.

There, even as they laid him down, began what seemed to be the mortal agony, and, though he
was scarcely sensible, his mother felt that her prime call was to him, while his brother was
in other hands.  Perhaps it was well for her.  Surgical practice was rough, and wounds made
by fire-arms were thought to have imbibed a poison that made treatment be supposed efficacious
in proportion to the pain inflicted.  When Ebbo was recalled by the torture to see no white
reflection of his own face on the pillow beside him, and to feel in vain for the grasp of the
cold damp hand, a delirious frenzy seized him, and his struggles were frustrating the doctor's
attempts, when a low soft sweet song stole through the open door.

"Friedel!" he murmured, and held his breath to listen.  All through the declining day did the
gentle sound continue; now of grand chants or hymns caught from the cathedral choir, now of
songs of chivalry or saintly legend so often sung over the evening fire; the one flowing into
the other in the wandering of failing powers, but never failing in the tender sweetness that
had distinguished Friedel through life. And, whenever that voice was heard, let them do to
him what they would, Ebbo was still absorbed in intense listening so as not to lose a note,
and lulled almost out of sense of suffering by that swan-like music.  If his attendants made
such noise as to break in on it, or if it ceased for a moment, the anguish returned, but was
charmed away by the weakest, faintest resumption of the song. That engineering was the interruption

What was now wanted was Freiherr Eberhard's signature to the letter to the Emperor, and his
authority for making terms with the new count; and haste was needed, lest the Markgraf of Wurtemburg
should represent the affray in the light of an outrage against a member of the League.

Christina saw the necessity, and undertook if possible to obtain her son's signature, but,
at the first mention of Master Moritz and the bridge, Ebbo turned away his head, groaned, and
begged to hear no more of either.  He thought of his bold declaration that the bridge must
be built, even at the cost of blood!  Little did he then guess of whose blood!  And in his
bitterness of spirit he felt a jealousy of that influence of Schleiermacher, which had of late
come between him and his brother.  He hated the very name, he said, and hid his face with a
shudder.  He hoped the torrent would sweep away every fragment of the bridge.

"Nay, Ebbo mine, wherefore wish ill to a good work that our blessed one loved?  Listen, and
let me tell you my dream for making yonder strand a peaceful memorial of our peaceful boy."

"To honour Friedel?" and he gazed on her with something like interest in his eyes.

"Yes, Ebbo, and as he would best brook honour.  Let us seek for ever to end the rival claims
to yon piece of meadow by praying this knight of a religious order, the new count, to unite
with us in building there--or as near as may be safe--a church of holy peace, and a cell for
a priest, who may watch over the bridge ward, and offer the holy sacrifice for the departed
of either house.  There will we place our gentle Friedel to be the first to guard the peace
of the ford, and there will we sleep ourselves when our time shall come, and so may the cruel
feud of many generations be slaked for ever."

"In his blood!" sighed Ebbo.  "Ah! would that it had been mine, mother.  It is well, as well
as anything can be again.  So shall the spot where he fell be made sacred, and fenced from
rude feet, and we shall see his fair effigy keeping his armed watch there."

And Christina was thankful to see his look of gratification, sad though it was.  She sat down
near his bed, and began to write a letter in their joint names to Graf Dankwart von Schlangenwald,
proposing that thus, after the even balance of the wrongs of the two houses, their mutual hostility
might be laid to rest for ever by the consecration of the cause of their long contention. 
It was a stiff and formal letter, full of the set pious formularies of the age, scarcely revealing
the deep heart-feeling within; but it was to the purpose, and Ebbo, after hearing it read,
heartily approved, and consented to sign both it and those that Schleiermacher had brought.
Christina held the scroll, and placed the pen in the fingers that had lately so easily wielded
the heavy sword, but now felt it a far greater effort to guide the slender quill.

Moritz Schleiermacher went his way in search of the King of the Romans, far off in Carinthia.
A full reply could not be expected till the campaign was over, and all that was known for some
time was through a messenger sent back to Ulm by Schleiermacher with the intelligence that
Maximilian would examine into the matter after his return, and that Count Dankwart would reply
when he should come to perform his father's obsequies after the army was dispersed.  There
was also a letter of kind though courtly condolence from Kasimir of Wildschloss, much grieving
for gallant young Sir Friedmund, proffering all the advocacy he could give the cause of Adlerstein,
and covertly proffering the protection that she and her remaining son might now be more disposed
to accept.  Christina suppressed this letter, knowing it would only pain and irritate Ebbo,
and that she had her answer ready.  Indeed, in her grief for one son, and her anxiety for the
other, perhaps it was this letter that first made her fully realize the drift of those earnest
words of Friedel's respecting his father.

Meantime the mother and son were alone together, with much of suffering and of sorrow, yet
with a certain tender comfort in the being all in all to one another, with none to intermeddle
with their mutual love and grief.  It was to Christina as if something of Friedel's sweetness
had passed to his brother in his patient helplessness, and that, while thus fully engrossed
with him, she had both her sons in one.  Nay, in spite of all the pain, grief, and weariness,
these were times when both dreaded any change, and the full recovery, when not only would the
loss of Friedel be every moment freshly brought home to his brother, but when Ebbo would go
in quest of his father.

For on this the young Baron had fixed his mind as a sacred duty, from the moment he had seen
that life was to be his lot.  He looked on his neglect of indications of the possibility of
his father's life in the light of a sin that had led to all his disasters, and not only regarded
the intended search as a token of repentance, but as a charge bequeathed to him by his less
selfish brother.  He seldom spoke of his intention, but his mother was perfectly aware of it,
and never thought of it without such an agony of foreboding dread as eclipsed all the hope
that lay beyond.  She could only turn away her mind from the thought, and be thankful for what
was still her own from day to day.

"Art weary, my son?" asked Christina one October afternoon, as Ebbo lay on his bed, languidly
turning the pages of a noble folio of the Legends of the Saints that Master Gottfried had sent
for his amusement.  It was such a book as fixed the ardour a few years later of the wounded
Navarrese knight, Inigo de Loyola, but Ebbo handled it as if each page were lead.

"Only thinking how Friedel would have glowed towards these as his own kinsmen," said Ebbo.
"Then should I have cared to read of them!" and he gave a long sigh.

"Let me take away the book," she said.  "Thou hast read long, and it is dark."

"So dark that there must surely be a snow-cloud."

"Snow is falling in the large flakes that our Friedel used to call winter-butterflies."

"Butterflies that will swarm and shut us in from the weary world," said Ebbo.  "And alack!
when they go, what a turmoil it will be! Councils in the Rathhaus, appeals to the League, wranglings
with the Markgraf, wise saws, overweening speeches, all alike dull and dead."

"It will scarce be so when strength and spirit have returned, mine Ebbo."

"Never can life be more to me than the way to him," said the lonely boy; "and I--never like
him--shall miss the road without him."

While he thus spoke in the listless dejection of sorrow and weakness, Hatto's aged step was
on the stair.  "Gracious lady," he said, "here is a huntsman bewildered in the hills, who has
been asking shelter from the storm that is drifting up."

"See to his entertainment, then, Hatto," said the lady.

"My lady--Sir Baron," added Hatto, "I had not come up but that this guest seems scarce gear
for us below.  He is none of the foresters of our tract.  His hair is perfumed, his shirt is
fine holland, his buff suit is of softest skin, his baldric has a jewelled clasp, and his arblast!
It would do my lord baron's heart good only to cast eyes on the perfect make of that arblast!
He has a lordly tread, and a stately presence, and, though he has a free tongue, and made friends
with us as he dried his garments, he asked after my lord like his equal."

"O mother, must you play the chatelaine?" asked Ebbo.  "Who can the fellow be?  Why did none
ever so come when they would have been more welcome?"

"Welcomed must he be," said Christina, rising, "and thy state shall be my excuse for not tarrying
longer with him than may be needful."

Yet, though shrinking from a stranger's face, she was not without hope that the variety might
wholesomely rouse her son from his depression, and in effect Ebbo, when left with Hatto, minutely
questioned him on the appearance of the stranger, and watched, with much curiosity, for his
mother's return.

"Ebbo mine," she said, entering, after a long interval, "the knight asks to see thee either
after supper, or to-morrow morn."

"Then a knight he is?"

"Yea, truly, a knight truly in every look and gesture, bearing his head like the leading stag
of the herd, and yet right gracious."

"Gracious to you, mother, in your own hall?" cried Ebbo, almost fiercely.

"Ah! jealous champion, thou couldst not take offence!  It was the manner of one free and courteous
to every one, and yet with an inherent loftiness that pervades all."

"Gives he no name?" said Ebbo.

"He calls himself Ritter Theurdank, of the suite of the late Kaisar, but I should deem him
wont rather to lead than to follow."

"Theurdank," repeated Eberhard, "I know no such name!  So, motherling, are you going to sup?
I shall not sleep till I have seen him!"

"Hold, dear son."  She leant over him and spoke low.  "See him thou must, but let me first
station Heinz and Koppel at the door with halberts, not within earshot, but thou art so entirely
defenceless."

She had the pleasure of seeing him laugh.  "Less defenceless than when the kinsman of Wildschloss
here visited us, mother?  I see for whom thou takest him, but let it be so; a spiritual knight
would scarce wreak his vengeance on a wounded man in his bed.  I will not have him insulted
with precautions.  If he has freely risked himself in my hands, I will as freely risk myself
in his.  Moreover, I thought he had won thy heart."

"Reigned over it, rather," said Christina.  "It is but the disguise that I suspect and mistrust.
Bid me not leave thee alone with him, my son."

"Nay, dear mother," said Ebbo, "the matters on which he is like to speak will brook no presence
save our own, and even that will be hard enough to bear.  So prop me more upright!  So!  And
comb out these locks somewhat smoother.  Thanks, mother.  Now can he see whether he will choose
Eberhard of Adlerstein for friend or foe."

By the time supper was ended, the only light in the upper room came from the flickering flames
of the fire of pine knots on the hearth. It glanced on the pale features and dark sad eyes
of the young Baron, sad in spite of the eager look of scrutiny that he turned on the figure
that entered at the door, and approached so quickly that the partial light only served to show
the gloss of long fair hair, the glint of a jewelled belt, and the outline of a tall, well-knit,
agile frame.

"Welcome, Herr Ritter," he said; "I am sorry we have been unable to give you a fitter reception."

"No host could be more fully excused than you," said the stranger, and Ebbo started at his
voice.  "I fear you have suffered much, and still have much to suffer."

"My sword wound is healing fast," said Ebbo; "it is the shot in my broken thigh that is so
tedious and painful."

"And I dare be sworn the leeches made it worse.  I have hated all leeches ever since they kept
me three days a prisoner in a 'pothecary's shop stinking with drugs.  Why, I have cured myself
with one pitcher of water of a raging fever, in their very despite!  How did they serve thee,
my poor boy?"

"They poured hot oil into the wound to remove the venom of the lead," said Ebbo.

"Had it been my case the lead should have been in their own brains first, though that were
scarce needed, the heavy-witted Hans Sausages.  Why should there be more poison in lead than
in steel?  I have asked all my surgeons that question, nor ever had a reasonable answer.  Greater
havoc of warriors do they make than ever with the arquebus--ay, even when every lanzknecht
bears one."

"Alack!" Ebbo could not help exclaiming, "where will be room for chivalry?"

"Talk not old world nonsense," said Theurdank; "chivalry is in the heart, not in the weapon.
A youth beforehand enough with the world to be building bridges should know that, when all
our troops are provided with such an arm, then will their platoons in serried ranks be as a
solid wall breathing fire, and as impregnable as the lines of English archers with long bows,
or the phalanx of Macedon.  And, when each man bears a pistol instead of the misericorde, his
life will be far more his own."

Ebbo's face was in full light, and his visitor marked his contracted brow and trembling lip.
"Ah!" he said, "thou hast had foul experience of these weapons."

"Not mine own hurt," said Ebbo; "that was but fair chance of war."

"I understand," said the knight; "it was the shot that severed the goodly bond that was so
fair to see.  Young man, none has grieved more truly than King Max."

"And well he may," said Ebbo.  "He has not lost merely one of his best servants, but all the
better half of another."

"There is still stuff enough left to make that ONE well worth having," said Theurdank, kindly
grasping his hand, "though I would it were more substantial!  How didst get old Wolfgang down,
boy?  He must have been a tough morsel for slight bones like these, even when better covered
than now.  Come, tell me all.  I promised the Markgraf of Wurtemburg to look into the matter
when I came to be guest at St. Ruprecht's cloister, and I have some small interest too with
King Max."

His kindliness and sympathy were more effectual with Ebbo than the desire to represent his
case favourably, for he was still too wretched to care for policy; but he answered Theurdank's
questions readily, and explained how the idea of the bridge had originated in the vigil beside
the broken waggons.

"I hope," said Theurdank, "the merchants made up thy share?  These overthrown goods are a seignorial
right of one or other of you lords of the bank."

"True, Herr Ritter; but we deemed it unknightly to snatch at what travellers lost by misfortune."

"Freiherr Eberhard, take my word for it, while thou thus holdest, all the arquebuses yet to
be cut out of the Black Forest will not mar thy chivalry.  Where didst get these ways of thinking?"

"My brother was a very St. Sebastian!  My mother--"

"Ah! her sweet wise face would have shown it, even had not poor Kasimir of Adlerstein raved
of her.  Ah! lad, thou hast crossed a case of true love there!  Canst not brook even such a
gallant stepfather?"

"I may not," said Ebbo, with spirit; "for with his last breath Schlangenwald owned that my
own father died not at the hostel, but may now be alive as a Turkish slave."

"The devil!" burst out Theurdank.  "Well! that might have been a pretty mess!  A Turkish slave,
saidst thou!  What year chanced all this matter--thy grandfather's murder and all the rest?"

"The year before my birth," said Ebbo.  "It was in the September of 1475."

"Ha!" muttered Theurdank, musing to himself; "that was the year the dotard Schenk got his overthrow
at the fight of Rain on Sare from the Moslem.  Some composition was made by them, and old Wolfgang
was not unlikely to have been the go-between.  So!  Say on, young knight," he added, "let us
to the matter in hand.  How rose the strife that kept back two troops from our--from the banner
of the empire?"

Ebbo proceeded with the narration, and concluded it just as the bell now belonging to the chapel
began to toll for compline, and Theurdank prepared to obey its summons, first, however, asking
if he should send any one to the patient.  Ebbo thanked him, but said he needed no one till
his mother should come after prayers.

"Nay, I told thee I had some leechcraft.  Thou art weary, and must rest more entirely;"--and,
giving him little choice, Theurdank supported him with one arm while removing the pillows that
propped him, then laid him tenderly down, saying, "Good night, and the saints bless thee, brave
young knight.  Sleep well, and recover in spite of the leeches.  I cannot afford to lose both
of you."

Ebbo strove to follow mentally the services that were being performed in the chapel, and whose
"Amens" and louder notes pealed up to him, devoid of the clear young tones that had sung their
last here below, but swelled by grand bass notes that as much distracted Ebbo's attention as
the memory of his guest's conversation; and he impatiently awaited his mother's arrival.

At length, lamp in hand, she appeared with tears shining in her eyes, and bending over him said,

"He hath done honour to our blessed one, my Ebbo; he knelt by him, and crossed him with holy
water, and when he led me from the chapel he told me any mother in Germany might envy me my
two sons even now. Thou must love him now, Ebbo."

"Love him as one loves one's loftiest model," said Ebbo--"value the old castle the more for
sheltering him."

"Hath he made himself known to thee?"

"Not openly, but there is only one that he can be."

Christina smiled, thankful that the work of pardon and reconciliation had been thus softened
by the personal qualities of the enemy, whose conduct in the chapel had deeply moved her.

"Then all will be well, blessedly well," she said.

"So I trust," said Ebbo, "but the bell broke our converse, and he laid me down as tenderly
as--O mother, if a father's kindness be like his, I have truly somewhat to regain."

"Knew he aught of the fell bargain?" whispered Christina.

"Not he, of course, save that it was a year of Turkish inroads.  He will speak more perchance
to-morrow.  Mother, not a word to any one, nor let us betray our recognition unless it be his
pleasure to make himself known."

"Certainly not," said Christina, remembering the danger that the household might revenge Friedel's
death if they knew the foe to be in their power.  Knowing as she did that Ebbo's admiration
was apt to be enthusiastic, and might now be rendered the more fervent by fever and solitude,
she was still at a loss to understand his dazzled, fascinated state.

When Heinz entered, bringing the castle key, which was always laid under the Baron's pillow,
Ebbo made a movement with his hand that surprised them both, as if to send it elsewhere--then
muttered, "No, no, not till he reveals himself," and asked, "Where sleeps the guest?"

"In the grandmother's room, which we fitted for a guest-chamber, little thinking who our first
would be," said his mother.

"Never fear, lady; we will have a care to him," said Heinz, somewhat grimly.

"Yes, have a care," said Ebbo, wearily; "and take care all due honour is shown to him!  Good
night, Heinz."

"Gracious lady," said Heinz, when by a sign he had intimated to her his desire of speaking
with her unobserved by the Baron, "never fear; I know who the fellow is as well as you do.
I shall be at the foot of the stairs, and woe to whoever tries to step up them past me."

"There is no reason to apprehend treason, Heinz, yet to be on our guard can do no harm."

"Nay, lady, I could look to the gear for the oubliette if you would speak the word."

"For heaven's sake, no, Heinz.  This man has come hither trusting to our honour, and you could
not do your lord a greater wrong, nor one that he could less pardon, than by any attempt on
our guest."

"Would that he had never eaten our bread!" muttered Heinz.  "Vipers be they all, and who knows
what may come next?"

"Watch, watch, Heinz; that is all," implored Christina, "and, above all, not a word to any
one else."

And Christina dismissed the man-at-arms gruff and sullen, and herself retired ill at ease between
fears of, and for, the unwelcome guest whose strange powers of fascination had rendered her,
in his absence, doubly distrustful.

CHAPTER XXI:  RITTER THEURDANK

The snow fell all night without ceasing, and was still falling on the morrow, when the guest
explained his desire of paying a short visit to the young Baron, and then taking his departure.
Christina would gladly have been quit of him, but she felt bound to remonstrate, for their
mountain was absolutely impassable during a fall of snow, above all when accompanied by wind,
since the drifts concealed fearful abysses, and the shifting masses insured destruction to
the unwary wayfarer; nay, natives themselves had perished between the hamlet and the castle.

"Not the hardiest cragsman, not my son himself," she said, "could venture on such a morning
to guide you to--"

"Whither, gracious dame?" asked Theurdank, half smiling.

"Nay, sir, I would not utter what you would not make known."

"You know me then?"

"Surely, sir, for our noble foe, whose generous trust in our honour must win my son's heart."

"So!" he said, with a peculiar smile, "Theurdank--Dankwart--I see! May I ask if your son likewise
smelt out the Schlangenwald?"

"Verily, Sir Count, my Ebbo is not easily deceived.  He said our guest could be but one man
in all the empire."

Theurdank smiled again, saying, "Then, lady, you shudder not at a man whose kin and yours have
shed so much of one another's blood?"

"Nay, ghostly knight, I regard you as no more stained therewith than are my sons by the deeds
of their grandfather."

"If there were more like you, lady," returned Theurdank, "deadly feuds would soon be starved
out.  May I to your son?  I have more to say to him, and I would fain hear his views of the storm."

Christina could not be quite at ease with Theurdank in her son's room, but she had no choice,
and she knew that Heinz was watching on the turret stair, out of hearing indeed, but as ready
to spring as a cat who sees her young ones in the hand of a child that she only half trusts.

Ebbo lay eagerly watching for his visitor, who greeted him with the same almost paternal kindness
he had evinced the night before, but consulted him upon the way from the castle.  Ebbo confirmed
his mother's opinion that the path was impracticable so long as the snow fell, and the wind
tossed it in wild drifts.

"We have been caught in snow," he said, "and hard work have we had to get home!  Once indeed,
after a bear hunt, we fully thought the castle stood before us, and lo! it was all a cruel
snow mist in that mocking shape.  I was even about to climb our last Eagle's Step, as I thought,
when behold, it proved to be the very brink of the abyss."

"Ah! these ravines are well-nigh as bad as those of the Inn.  I've known what it was to be
caught on the ledge of a precipice by a sharp wind, changing its course, mark'st thou, so swiftly
that it verily tore my hold from the rock, and had well-nigh swept me into a chasm of mighty
depth.  There was nothing for it but to make the best spring I might towards the crag on the
other side, and grip for my life at my alpenstock, which by Our Lady's grace was firmly planted,
and I held on till I got breath again, and felt for my footing on the ice-glazed rock."

"Ah!" said Eberhard with a long breath, after having listened with a hunter's keen interest
to this hair's-breadth escape, "it sounds like a gust of my mountain air thus let in on me."

"Truly it is dismal work for a lusty hunter to lie here," said Theurdank, "but soon shalt thou
take thy crags again in full vigour, I hope.  How call'st thou the deep gray lonely pool under
a steep frowning crag sharpened well-nigh to a spear point, that I passed yester afternoon?"

"The Ptarmigan's Mere, the Red Eyrie," murmured Ebbo, scarcely able to utter the words as he
thought of Friedel's delight in the pool, his exploit at the eyrie, and the gay bargain made
in the streets of Ulm, that he should show the scaler of the Dom steeple the way to the eagle's
nest.

"I remember," said his guest gravely, coming to his side.  "Ah, boy! thy brother's flight has
been higher yet.  Weep freely; fear me not. Do I not know what it is, when those who were over-good
for earth have found their eagle's wings, and left us here?"

Ebbo gazed up through his tears into the noble, mournful face that was bent kindly over him.
"I will not seek to comfort thee by counselling thee to forget," said Theurdank.  "I was scarce
thine elder when my life was thus rent asunder, and to hoar hairs, nay, to the grave itself,
will she be my glory and my sorrow.  Never owned I brother, but I trow ye two were one in no
common sort."

"Such brothers as we saw at Ulm were little like us," returned Ebbo, from the bottom of his
heart.  "We were knit together so that all will begin with me as if it were the left hand remaining
alone to do it!  I am glad that my old life may not even in shadow be renewed till after I
have gone in quest of my father."

"Be not over hasty in that quest," said the guest, "or the infidels may chance to gain two
Freiherren instead of one.  Hast any designs?"

Ebbo explained that he thought of making his way to Genoa to consult the merchant Gian Battista
dei Battiste, whose description of the captive German noble had so strongly impressed Friedel.
Ebbo knew the difference between Turks and Moors, but Friedel's impulse guided him, and he
further thought that at Genoa he should learn the way to deal with either variety of infidel.
Theurdank thought this a prudent course, since the Genoese had dealings both at Tripoli and
Constantinople; and, moreover, the transfer was not impossible, since the two different hordes
of Moslems trafficked among themselves when either had made an unusually successful razzia.

"Shame," he broke out, "that these Eastern locusts, these ravening hounds, should prey unmolested
on the fairest lands of the earth, and our German nobles lie here like swine, grunting and
squealing over the plunder they grub up from one another, deaf to any summons from heaven or
earth!  Did not Heaven's own voice speak in thunder this last year, even in November, hurling
the mighty thunderbolt of Alsace, an ell long, weighing two hundred and fifteen pounds?  Did
I not cause it to be hung up in the church of Encisheim, as a witness and warning of the plagues
that hang over us?  But no, nothing will quicken them from their sloth and drunkenness till
the foe are at their doors; and, if a man arise of different mould, with some heart for the
knightly, the good, and the true, then they kill him for me! But thou, Adlerstein, this pious
quest over, thou wilt return to me. Thou hast head to think and heart to feel for the shame
and woe of this misguided land."

"I trust so, my lord," said Ebbo.  "Truly, I have suffered bitterly for pursuing my own quarrel
rather than the crusade."

"I meant not thee," said Theurdank, kindly.  "Thy bridge is a benefit to me, as much as, or
more than, ever it can be to thee.  Dost know Italian?  There is something of Italy in thine eye."

"My mother's mother was Italian, my lord; but she died so early that her language has not descended
to my mother or myself."

"Thou shouldst learn it.  It will be pastime while thou art bed-fast, and serve thee well in
dealing with the Moslem.  Moreover, I may have work for thee in Welschland.  Books?  I will
send thee books.  There is the whole chronicle of Karl the Great, and all his Palsgrafen, by
Pulci and Boiardo, a brave Count and gentleman himself, governor of Reggio, and worthy to sing
of deeds of arms; so choice, too, as to the names of his heroes, that they say he caused his
church bells to be rung when he had found one for Rodomonte, his infidel Hector.  He has shown
up Roland as a love-sick knight, though, which is out of all accord with Archbishop Turpin.
Wilt have him?"

"When we were together, we used to love tales of chivalry."

"Ah!  Or wilt have the stern old Ghibelline Florentine, who explored the three realms of the
departed?  Deep lore, and well-nigh unsearchable, is his; but I love him for the sake of his
Beatrice, who guided him.  May we find such guides in our day!"

"I have heard of him," said Ebbo.  "If he will tell me where my Friedel walks in light, then,
my lord, I would read him with all my heart."

"Or wouldst thou have rare Franciscus Petrarca?  I wot thou art too young as yet for the yearnings
of his sonnets, but their voice is sweet to the bereft heart."

And he murmured over, in their melodious Italian flow, the lines on Laura's death

"Not pallid, but yet whiter than the snow By wind unstirred that on a hillside lies; Rest seemed
as on a weary frame to grow, A gentle slumber pressed her lovely eyes."

"Ah!" he added aloud to himself, "it is ever to me as though the poet had watched in that chamber
at Ghent."

Such were the discourses of that morning, now on poetry and book lore; now admiration of the
carvings that decked the room; now talk on grand architectural designs, or improvements in
fire-arms, or the discussion of hunting adventures.  There seemed nothing in art, life, or
learning in which the versatile mind of Theurdank was not at home, or that did not end in some
strange personal reminiscence of his own. All was so kind, so gracious, and brilliant, that
at first the interview was full of wondering delight to Ebbo, but latterly it became very fatiguing
from the strain of attention, above all towards a guest who evidently knew that he was known,
while not permitting such recognition to be avowed. It is surprising what we larn himself from publication,
"etc., etc., etc. As babu has get one bald proposition of a publication that there is worked
down to leave
on his series. I inquire Stubble. Thus and So be about it and he
state why not: that Crackle had 400,000,000 group.  Considerate as his visitor had been the night before,
the pleasure of talk seemed to have done away with the remembrance of his host's weakness,
till Ebbo so flagged that at last he was scarcely alive to more than the continued sound of
the voice, and all the pain that for a while had been in abeyance seemed to have mastered him;
but his guest, half reading his books, half discoursing, seemed too much immersed in his own
plans, theories, and adventures, to mark the condition of his auditor.

Interruption came at last, however.  There was a sudden knock at the door at noon, and with
scant ceremony Heinz entered, followed by three other of the men-at-arms, fully equipped.

"Ha! what means this?" demanded Ebbo.

"Peace, Sir Baron," said Heinz, advancing so as to place his large person between Ebbo's bed
and the strange hunter.  "You know nothing of it.  We are not going to lose you as well as
your brother, and we mean to see how this knight likes to serve as a hostage instead of opening
the gates as a traitor spy.  On him, Koppel! it is thy right."

"Hands off! at your peril, villains!" exclaimed Ebbo, sitting up, and speaking in the steady
resolute voice that had so early rendered him thoroughly their master, but much perplexed and
dismayed, and entirely unassisted by Theurdank, who stood looking on with almost a smile, as
if diverted by his predicament.

"By your leave, Herr Freiherr," said Heinz, putting his hand on his shoulder, "this is no concern
of yours.  While you cannot guard yourself or my lady, it is our part to do so.  I tell you
his minions are on their way to surprise the castle."

Even as Heinz spoke, Christina came panting into the room, and, hurrying to her son's side,
said, "Sir Count, is this just, is this honourable, thus to return my son's welcome, in his
helpless condition?"

"Mother, are you likewise distracted?" exclaimed Ebbo.  "What is all this madness?"

"Alas, my son, it is no frenzy!  There are armed men coming up the Eagle's Stairs on the one
hand and by the Gemsbock's Pass on the other!"

"But not a hair of your head shall they hurt, lady," said Heinz. "This fellow's limbs shall
be thrown to them over the battlements. On, Koppel!"

"Off, Koppel!" thundered Ebbo.  "Would you brand me with shame for ever?  Were he all the Schlangenwalds
in one, he should go as freely as he came; but he is no more Schlangenwald than I am."

"He has deceived you, my lord," said Heinz.  "My lady's own letter to Schlangenwald was in
his chamber.  'Tis a treacherous disguise."

"Fool that thou art!" said Ebbo.  "I know this gentleman well.  I knew him at Ulm.  Those who
meet him here mean me no ill.  Open the gates and receive them honourably!  Mother, mother,
trust me, all is well.  I know what I am saying."

The men looked one upon another.  Christina wrung her hands, uncertain whether her son were
not under some strange fatal deception.

"My lord has his fancies," growled Koppel.  "I'll not be balked of my right of vengeance for
his scruples!  Will he swear that this fellow is what he calls himself?"

"I swear," said Ebbo, slowly, "that he is a true loyal knight, well known to me."

"Swear it distinctly, Sir Baron," said Heinz.  "We have all too deep a debt of vengeance to
let off any one who comes here lurking in the interest of our foe.  Swear that this is Theurdank,
or we send his head to greet his friends."

Drops stood on Ebbo's brow, and his breath laboured as he felt his senses reeling, and his
powers of defence for his guest failing him. When some daring and daring intellectual of its own quality
has cowed it, as the Herb, cæsars and Cards have done, it has process out with slaughter and be
slaughtered to a sullen superbia in the cunning that this mightier ferocity
has set upon it.

"I cannot swear that his real name is Theurdank," said Ebbo, rallying his forces, "but this
I swear, that he is neither friend nor fosterer of Schlangenwald, that I know him, and I had
rather die than that the slightest indignity were offered him."  Here, and with a great effort
that terribly wrenched his wounded leg, he reached past Heinz, and grasped his guest's hand,
pulling him as near as he could.

"Sir," he said, "if they try to lay hands on you, strike my death- blow!"
