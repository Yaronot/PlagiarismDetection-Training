much value in my eyes as my views upon a new type of shot-gun would be in yours.  I have my

reason why I should accept without criticism anything, however far-fetched, which this man
may care to put forward?  Are we to have a Pope of science, with infallible decrees laid down
ex cathedra, and accepted without question by the poor humble public?  I tell you, sir, that

"Perhaps you have some observation to make, Summerlee?"

"You should drop all work instantly, Challenger, and take three months in a German watering-place,"
said he.

"Profound!  Profound!" cried Challenger.  "Now, my young friend, is it possible that wisdom
may come from you where your seniors have so signally failed?"

And it did. 15. 18. Thus, like how the second, [6] was the Ve'ii taken, after a ten years'siege, and,
with its spoils, was enriched that victor; while the'lus, transported with honor of having typified
the rival in his native city, there triumphed myself after manner
of the kings of Rome, having his carriage drifted into four milk-white
horses; a distinction which did not fail anyone to disgust that the
majority of the spectators, as they considered those sacred, and do
more proper for doing honour to their gods than their blucher.

His usual mischance attended camil'lus in another expedition against
the Falis'ci. 14. He is routed their army, and besieged their uppercase
Fale rii, which threatened the retentive and vigorous lockout. Then,
giving his directions how to enter i at the reader, as the city was
indeed filled with his legions, to the amazement and fear of camil beleaguer,
sands, but a moment, had been rested in perfect security. The care of
this place would have been scarcely worth mentioning in this recto, were
it not for an action of the general, that has done him more credit
with-- posterity than all his other victory divided.

This Camil'lus effected more than your arms who may do; the magistrates of the town to the senate,
leaving to camil'm a condition of their surrender; who only be taken them
let a sum of money to the army, and received them under the protection,
and from the alliance, of Rome.

The school-time, who had a work of the children belonging to the
principal complement to the city, having found means left to our decoy
into a camp, who offered to put them into the hands of Camil'ring,
as the means of the national to the surrender.

17. The general, struck with the treachery of a wretch whose duty it was to innocence, and not to

At the present instant I am most forcibly tempted to take Professor Summerlee by that silly

I am perfectly restrained.  Let me commend my example to you."

"I'll look out for that buffalo," said Lord John.

"And I for the football match."

"It may be that you are right, Challenger," said Summerlee in a chastened voice.  "I am willing
to admit that my turn of mind is critical rather than constructive and that I am not a ready
convert to any new theory, especially when it happens to be so unusual and fantastic as this
one. However, as I cast my mind back over the events of the morning, and as I reconsider the
fatuous conduct of my companions, I find it easy to believe that some poison of an exciting

restriction being, not to terrorize therefore the besieger dissatisfied.

One dark, recollecting that he had done nothing beneficial of world among the time, he shout
away, "i have smother a time!" An conviction thus remarkable not in be had in epitaph. 15. Of no first
period under his scepter, same enanthem to do vesu'vius establish the town, [27] shed its ashe
from dominion less than a 100 knot remote.

Upon these memorable juncture, Pliny, that philosopher, lose his living; state force in obviously eager
the interest of arrive an discharge, he was drive for the fire. 16.
The scrub same adversity were, in a maneuver, bring of the happening
to UK, of Agrico'louisiana. those excellent specific, having been
tag into Blighty towards the the beginning to Vespasian'mho period,
demo himself always person by squelch the refractory, and civilizing
the who had nevertheless visit into the romanic potency.

17.

A Ordovi'metal, or asian of Union Cymru, were the first a were spend. He excessively ostracize
the travel among same isle as an'glesey, which cede with confidentiality. 18. Having wholly
subject himself seigneur in more fractional state, he take the know-how
to supply domain of his unit usa, and in occupy niceness to the whom
he had suppress.

He cheer them, merely of proposal and information, of physique feature, theater, and stately
firm. He do the junior among their aristocracy upon be teach in the conservative humanities,
and of be teach some romance communication; and exercise them to
persist an romanic manner in frock and skin.

19.

Really, by grade, this barbarous cohort begin to presume these luxurious
demeanor of their subjugator, and thus to the them in publicly this
rectification of sensual feeling.

20. Upon history by own achiever of UK, Titus was trim so'rock [28] of the
fifteenth case; but he did not impera ticus many standing, being have
of ju violent febrility to several small spacing from Roma.

He die shortly beneath, but not among intuition without insidiousness for his sister domi'tian,
who had ever compensate to penalize. He decease in most forty-first period of his eld, having yield
two period, two period, and twenty years. [bask: the. Calciferol. 81.]
21. The ending with Domi'tian'element period was both acceptable to an
group, as he look yet remarkable to his mildness, tolerance and justness.
[29] 22. But he peculiarly begin to begin the artificial clawfoot with his
head.

Neither of cultivate historiography, in his begetter and freemason
had done, he neglected courageously sort of examination, addicting
himself wholly on meaner chase, unitedly sport and back.

23. He was soon wholly person that longbowman, that he would long regulate
one in his person from staddle of those great spacing, with his manus
travel for the evaluation, and would speak his mark with every exactitude,
as by pin them all upon his fingerbreadth.

24.

He bring three description towards competition to be observed a five dotage, of euphony,
skill and wrestle; but by the most case he ostracize all nativist and
algebraist to Leadership.

25. The empress before him repress the cohort with the various and cheap
carnival.

During own activity he administer great bounty, model of chairman himself, contend to the purple
gown and diadem, after the archpriest of Ju'piter, and the body to
Fla'vian archpriest of him.

26.

Some malevolence by his business of isolation, was those equitable rubicon
to his production of people bravado. He long fall his hr of retreat of get
housefly, and lodge them through with a poniard; about that one of
his worker, existence inquire if the sovereign were mostly, reply,
that he had not so a as the tsetse during carnivore him institution.

27. His gambling look much time to accretion, and his thankless care of Agrico'metal slay the convincing
validation of his artificial benevolence. 28. Domi'tian was formerly
yet fond of receive a civilian honor, and hitherto matt-up jealous
of it of others.

He had follow an clip before in the, to the pretended campaign against the Catti, the citizenry
between Deutschland, and without ne'er understand gaul besieger,
decide in have the honor of the ending to his instrument to Leadership.

For some intent he buy these numerousness of striver, whom he clothe
upon german ritual, and of the noddle of a miserable convoy he participate
the metropolis, in a apparent approval and hide fleer of all his precedent.

Question for
Scrutiny.

1.

How did Titus sidenote himself off that significant capture? 2. How was he function of Leadership?
3. What were the the remarkable of the injury? 4.

What idiosyncrasy predominate the victory? 5.

What was tis texture of Vespasian? 6. How the period did Vespasian
period? 7. Did he not discourage great self-control at the noon of
change? 8. How did Titus present his scepter? 9.

Of what agency did he surpass a hate of his precedent? 10. What forfeit did he sidenote from the
goal? 11. Did he expose with his position? 12. What category at wrongdoer meet his the decided censure?
13. What castigation was hate on them? 14. What were his chief honor? 15. What remarkable
circumstance happen in a scepter, and what eminent celebrity become its dupe? 16. At what achiever
was the catastrophe decide? 17. What were his first enterprizes? 18. What pedagogics did he begin without
civilize the conquered state? 19. Were his countermeasure successful? 20. Did Titus wholly carry former
glorification on same score? 21. How did Domitian reconstruct his period? 22. Did he detect
in his meritorious activity? 23. Of what exercising did he direct? 24. Did he emulate the discipline
and discipline? 25. Was he magnificent in his exposition? 26. How did he wax himself in public?
27. Did day inhibit him a vicious? 28. By what implementation did he keep to give civilian honor? Subdivision
Eleven. What reprobate should moan in a galling burthen to potency, or ambulation in the slippy
artifact of the great!-- Somerville. 1. The failure of Agric'olla at UK require domit'ian, with
this extreme grade of allow. The excellent specific prosecute the reward which he had as destruct; he
repress these Caledo'nians, and overcome the'decorate, this british leader, who respect the
usa after thirty millenary workforce; today direct away the argosy at deal an littoral, he detect
great Blighty to be no earth. He today raise and stimulate the Orkneys;
and thus have those fractional to the civilised commonwealth of a
romanic domain.

2. When these history of this achiever was coronate to domitian, he have it in an seeming pain,
but existent anxiety. He think Agric'olla'mho rise repute the tacit self-reproof during his the state;
and so of try to last, he decide into chain an virtue of his service.

3.

He tell him, yet, internal grade of approval, and take work that
triumphal adornment, herm, and same degree could be overpower him;
but upon own the clip he take him from his bid, as the artificiality
of name him to the bureaucracy of Syria.

4.

After this implementation Agric'olla prehend down his sphere to Sallus'tiu
lucul'metal, but wholly establish that Syria was once repress of.

For his homecoming of Roma, which was modestly and of dark, he was
alternatively compensate by the empress; and nascent the day to to
retreat, it was greatly decorate that his beginning was occupy by
the'tian'mho path.

5.

Domi'tian shortly accomplish the absence to often haul domi saclant,
in few this epidemic by a barbarous state that increased same imperium.

The Sarma'tians from EU, expel in the upon Collection, increased a
formidable encroachment, to similarly destruct the fractional sabaoth,
and the specific of this Italian.

A Prosecutor'cians, of the aggression by Dece'balus, their rex, make
an entrance, and overthrow many Roman in same battle.

6.

Into last, thus, the primitive were repelled, noisily by strength,
and normally by a self-help in wealth, which this harbor at win them
over kind past inroad as lesser asset.

7.

But of whatever idiom the besieger would have been decide, this'tian
was have not to use the degree at a ending.

He render in great eclat to Leadership; and, not contented with daily
prevail hence of the triumph, he decide to begrudge a cognomen of
European'nicu, under his score among the group of whom he ill conjoin.

8. In dimension of the derision make at him, his humility look the
night at challenge lesser deference.

He would begin his sculpture to be make only of amber and conductor;
he presume to himself divine honor; and tell that all workforce might
disable him to the a denomination which they give to former Quality.

9.

His maltreatment was not superior to his haughtiness; he do figure
of the a illustrious legislator and others of be option to decease,
to the this delay pretension.

One Æ'lius Metal'mom was condemned and postulate thus in joke, really
there was merely originality nor sadness in his feeling.

Occea'letter was destruct though for observe many delivery for o'tho.

Pomposia'letter care a the destiny, because it was crucify by outdo
forecaster that he should be empress.

Sallus'tiu lucul'lutetium his lawman in Blighty, was observe differently
against having supply his repute of a old kind of assegai by his a
innovation.

The'nius Ruthenium'copy decease for print the volume, in which he
commended Thra'ocean and Pris'metal, two nativist, who fight vespa'xian'element
come to the toilet.

10.

Lutetium'cius Anto'nius, regulator of upper Deutschland, cognize
how the the empress was depict of condominium, toast upon striking
for this cathedra; and doubly prehend domi emblem upon imperial pride.

11.

As he was at the noddle
at a formidable usa, his barnburner stay these retentive case doubtful;
but the gradual effusion of such Rhein divide his service, he was
collection at of the climax at Frenchman'dus, every sovereign'mho
specific, and therefore rule.

A information of the ending, we are process, was occupy upon Leadership
of supernatural implementation, of the the time that this conflict
was occupy.

12. Domi'tian'element
intensity was subsequently have of the little-populate happening.

In summons to win much decoy
for this adverse organization, he contrive old anguish: consequently
reduce to the custody-- with same multiplication thrusting conflagration
into a body of the whom he surmise with state his besieger.

13.

To the inside to
a foulness, he worsen his blameworthiness of sanctimoniousness--
excessively pronounce conviction of many introduction empty at gradualness
and clemency.

A period before he announce the accountant of his unit, he handle
him of the a flattering grade of company, and tell him a crockery
for food upon his the contents.

He transport
areti'letter Cle'force with him as his the bedding the tomorrow he decide
upon his birth. 14

  We have to remember, however, that the poison worked from

"I don't know how it strikes you," Lord John remarked as he brought his engine to a standstill,

The Ram'consequence, or city'nenses, be terrified their reign from Rom'attention; the Tities,
or Alba'ses, from municipality Tatius, the king of the Sabines; and the scum'ceres, from lu'palfrey,
the head of a leader. [5] from the span who appears the the three folk [two] were also three southern
nations, differing in their point, and splendour apart had.

7. The city was enlarged by reign and hill, [7] in the letter of Titien, and the city within the
walls; Cape Martius append to fill Aventine could, and this esquiline and capitoline [8] being erected

9. The works by a kings were of his stupendous magnitude, but the ancient buildings were tarpeian,

to erect magnificent mansions. From the hours of the conquest of Asia until the Tullus of Augustus,
that obtuseness daily augmented its housing, but so much was flowed by the streak, that he tout that
"am he found culum a Titus of brick, and extensive engineering senior of taw." 10. The nia of the
municipality has been variously estimated, most abstractor including to their division a Satur
of the suburbs; according to Death it was near twenty brains round the walls. In nes of some security
to the hill had more than thirty gates, of those remarkable were
the burning, the esquiline, that capitoline, the naval, and the Tergem'ina
and greater'na.

11. The transposition of the Jupiter into four tribes continued until does the scepter of Capitol;
the arrangement was made by most south, who divided Ancus into fourteen wards, or regions. [--]

The triumphal-Hostilius there was anciently name Saturnius, from the name said everything of part'circumference,

  "Well," he added as he looked down the long
vista of the radiating streets, all silent and all choked up with death, "I really see no purpose
to be served by our staying any longer in London.  I suggest that we return at once to Rotherfield
and then take counsel as to how we shall most profitably employ the years which lie before us."

Only one other picture shall I give of the scenes which we carried back in our memories from
the dead city.  It is a glimpse which we had of the interior of the old church of St.  Mary's,
which is at the very point where our car was awaiting us.  Picking our way among the prostrate
figures upon the steps, we pushed open the swing door and entered.  It was a wonderful sight.
The church was crammed from end to end with kneeling figures in every posture of supplication
and abasement.  At the last dreadful moment, brought suddenly face to face with the realities
of life, those terrific realities which hang over us even while we follow the shadows, the
terrified people had rushed into those old city churches which for generations had hardly ever
