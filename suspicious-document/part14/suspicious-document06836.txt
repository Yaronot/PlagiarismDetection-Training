XLVIII.  Before he left the province, he formed a design of the most horrid cruelty--to massacre
the legions which had mutinied upon the death of Augustus, for seizing and detaining by force
his father, Germanicus, their commander, and himself, then an infant, in the camp.  Though
he was with great difficulty dissuaded from this rash attempt, yet neither the most urgent
entreaties nor representations could prevent him from persisting in the design of decimating
these legions.  Accordingly, he ordered them to assemble unarmed, without so much as their
swords; and then surrounded them with armed horse.  But finding that many of them, suspecting
that violence was intended, were making off, to arm in their own defence, he quitted the assembly
as fast as he could, and immediately marched for Rome; bending now all his fury against the
senate, whom he publicly threatened, to divert the general attention from the clamour excited
by his disgraceful conduct.  Amongst other pretexts of offence, he complained that he was defrauded
of a triumph, which was justly his due, though he had just before forbidden, upon pain of death,
any honour to be decreed him.

XLIX.  In his march he was waited upon by deputies from the senatorian order, entreating him
to hasten his return.  He replied to them, "I will come, I will come, and this with me," striking
at the same time the hilt of his sword.  He issued likewise this proclamation: "I am coming,
but for those only who wish for me, the equestrian order and the people; for I shall no longer
treat the senate as their fellow-citizen or prince." He forbad any of the senators to come
to meet him; and either abandoning or deferring his triumph, he entered the city in ovation
on his birthday.  Within four months from this period he was slain, after he had perpetrated
enormous crimes, and while he was meditating the execution, if possible, of still greater.
He had entertained a design of removing to Antium, and afterwards to Alexandria; having first
cut off the flower of the equestrian and senatorian orders.  This is placed beyond all question,
by two books which were found in his cabinet (285) under different titles; one being called
the sword, and the other, the dagger. They both contained private marks, and the names of those
who were devoted to death.  There was also found a large chest, filled with a variety of poisons
which being afterwards thrown into the sea by order of Claudius, are said to have so infected
the waters, that the fish were poisoned, and cast dead by the tide upon the neighbouring shores.

L.  He was tall, of a pale complexion, ill-shaped, his neck and legs very slender, his eyes
and temples hollow, his brows broad and knit, his hair thin, and the crown of the head bald.
The other parts of his body were much covered with hair.  On this account, it was reckoned
a capital crime for any person to look down from above, as he was passing by, or so much as
to name a goat.  His countenance, which was naturally hideous and frightful, he purposely rendered
more so, forming it before a mirror into the most horrible contortions.  He was crazy both
in body and mind, being subject, when a boy, to the falling sickness.  It is believed that
his wife Caesonia administered to him a love potion which threw him into a frenzy.  What most
of all disordered him, was want of sleep, for he seldom had more than three or four hours'
rest in a night; and even then his sleep was not sound, but disturbed by strange dreams; fancying,
among other things, that a form representing the ocean spoke to him.  Being therefore often
weary with lying awake so long, sometimes he sat up in his bed, at others, walked in the longest
porticos about the house, and from time to time, invoked and looked out for the approach of day.

LI.  To this crazy constitution of his mind may, I think, very justly be ascribed two faults
which he had, of a nature directly repugnant one to the other, namely, an excessive confidence
and the most abject timidity. For he, who affected so (286) much to despise the gods, was ready
to shut his eyes, and wrap up his head in his cloak at the slightest storm of thunder and lightning;
and if it was violent, he got up and hid himself under his bed.  In his visit to Sicily, after
ridiculing many strange objects which that country affords, he ran away suddenly in the night
from Messini, terrified by the smoke and rumbling at the summit of Mount Aetna.  And though
in words he was very valiant against the barbarians, yet upon passing a narrow defile in Germany
in his light car, surrounded by a strong body of his troops, some one happening to say, "There
would be no small consternation amongst us, if an enemy were to appear," he immediately mounted
his horse, and rode towards the bridges in great haste; but finding them blocked up with camp-followers
and baggage-waggons, he was in such a hurry, that he caused himself to be carried in men's
hands over the heads of the crowd.  Soon afterwards, upon hearing that the Germans were again
in rebellion, he prepared to quit Rome, and equipped a fleet; comforting himself with this
consideration, that if the enemy should prove victorious, and possess themselves of the heights
of the Alps, as the Cimbri [454] had done, or of the city, as the Senones [455] formerly did,
he should still have in reserve the transmarine provinces [456].  Hence it was, I suppose,
that it occurred to his assassins, to invent the story intended to pacify the troops who mutinied
at his death, that he had laid violent hands upon himself, in a fit of terror occasioned by
the news brought him of the defeat of his army.

LII.  In the fashion of his clothes, shoes, and all the rest of his dress, he did not wear
what was either national, or properly civic, or peculiar to the male sex, or appropriate to
mere mortals.  He often appeared abroad in a short coat of stout cloth, richly embroidered
and blazing with jewels, in a tunic with sleeves, and with bracelets upon his arms; sometimes
all in silks and (287) habited like a woman; at other times in the crepidae or buskins; sometimes
in the sort of shoes used by the light-armed soldiers, or in the sock used by women, and commonly
with a golden beard fixed to his chin, holding in his hand a thunderbolt, a trident, or a caduceus,
marks of distinction belonging to the gods only. Sometimes, too, he appeared in the habit of
Venus.  He wore very commonly the triumphal ornaments, even before his expedition, and sometimes
the breast-plate of Alexander the Great, taken out of his coffin. [457]

LIII.  With regard to the liberal sciences, he was little conversant in philology, but applied
himself with assiduity to the study of eloquence, being indeed in point of enunciation tolerably
elegant and ready; and in his perorations, when he was moved to anger, there was an abundant
flow of words and periods.  In speaking, his action was vehement, and his voice so strong,
that he was heard at a great distance.  When winding up an harangue, he threatened to draw
"the sword of his lucubration," holding a loose and smooth style in such contempt, that he
said Seneca, who was then much admired, "wrote only detached essays," and that "his language
was nothing but sand without lime."  He often wrote answers to the speeches of successful orators;
and employed himself in composing accusations or vindications of eminent persons, who were
impeached before the senate; and gave his vote for or against the party accused, according
to his success in speaking, inviting the equestrian order, by proclamation, to hear him.

LIV.  He also zealously applied himself to the practice of several other arts of different
kinds, such as fencing, charioteering, singing, and dancing.  In the first of these, he practised
with the weapons used in war; and drove the chariot in circuses built in several places.  He
was so extremely fond of singing and dancing, that he could not refrain in the theatre from
singing with the tragedians, and imitating the gestures of the actors, either by way of applause
or correction.  A night exhibition which he had ordered the day he was slain, was thought to
be intended for no other reason, than to take the opportunity afforded by the licentiousness
of the season, to make his first appearance upon the stage.  Sometimes, also, (288) he danced
in the night.  Summoning once to the Palatium, in the second watch of the night [458], three
men of consular rank, who feared the words from the message, he placed them on the proscenium
of the stage, and then suddenly came bursting out, with a loud noise of flutes and castanets
[459], dressed in a mantle and tunic reaching down to his heels.  Having danced out a song,
he retired.  Yet he who had acquired such dexterity in other exercises, never learnt to swim.

LV.  Those for whom he once conceived a regard, he favoured even to madness.  He used to kiss
Mnester, the pantomimic actor, publicly in the theatre; and if any person made the least noise
while he was dancing, he would order him to be dragged from his seat, and scourged him with
his own hand.  A Roman knight once making some bustle, he sent him, by a centurion, an order
to depart forthwith for Ostia [460], and carry a letter from him to king Ptolemy in Mauritania.
The letter was comprised in these words: "Do neither good nor harm to the bearer."  He made
some gladiators captains of his German guards.  He deprived the gladiators called Mirmillones
of some of their arms.  One Columbus coming off with victory in a combat, but being slightly
wounded, he ordered some poison to be infused in the wound, which he thence called Columbinum.
For thus it was certainly named with his own hand in a list of other poisons.  He was so extravagantly
fond of the party of charioteers whose colours were green [461], that he supped and lodged
for some time constantly in the stable where their horses were kept.  At a certain revel, he
made a present of two millions of sesterces to one Cythicus, a driver of a chariot.  The day
before the Circensian games, he used to send his soldiers to enjoin silence in the (289) neighbourhood,
that the repose of his horse Incitatus [462] might not be disturbed.  For this favourite animal,
besides a marble stable, an ivory manger, purple housings, and a jewelled frontlet, he appointed
a house, with a retinue of slaves, and fine furniture, for the reception of such as were invited
in the horse's name to sup with him. Have they call her have art in suffering from Leader, for she leave of

Thou was Lygia were present,

to finance not again his neighbour, and night, therefore thus. Formerly
act vangio and a, two sister from his, that the jr to Vibilius, body,
had lose to strength that him said of Extraction hither-- to woman. "
  Some construed the latter into a presage that the master of
the place was in danger from his own guards; and the other they regarded as a sign, that an
illustrious person would be cut off, as had happened before on that day.  Sylla, the astrologer,
being, consulted by him respecting his nativity, assured him, "That death would unavoidably
and speedily befall him."  The oracle of Fortune at Antium likewise forewarned him of Cassius;
on which account he had given orders for putting to death Cassius Longinus, at that time proconsul
of Asia, not considering that Chaerea bore also that name.  The day preceding his death he
dreamt that he was standing in heaven near the throne of Jupiter, who giving him a push with
the great toe of his right foot, he fell headlong upon the earth.  Some things which happened
the very day of his death, and only a little before it, were likewise considered as ominous
presages of that event.  Whilst he was at sacrifice, he was bespattered with the blood of a
flamingo.  And Mnester, the pantomimic actor, performed in a play, which the tragedian Neoptolemus
had formerly acted at the games in which Philip, the king of Macedon, was slain.  And in the
piece called Laureolus, in which the principal actor, running out in a hurry, and falling,
vomited blood, several of the inferior actors vying with each other to give the best specimen
of their art, made the whole stage flow with blood.  A spectacle had been purposed to be performed
that night, in which the fables of the infernal regions were to be represented by Egyptians
and Ethiopians.

LVIII.  On the ninth of the calends of February [24th January], and about the seventh hour
of the day, after hesitating whether he should rise to dinner, as his stomach was disordered
by what he had eaten the day before, at last, by the advice of his friends, he came forth. He did so
the question; and, he did specially, we recognize into earth, it are free. "" alas! Petronius,
had his it is easier to find from banishment was thrown by world
than some ashes over counsel.

"" it tell me burnt, what is thy wish then? "
  Respecting what followed,
(291) two different accounts are given.  Some say, that, whilst he was speaking to the boys,
Chaerea came behind him, and gave him a heavy blow on the neck with his sword, first crying
out, "Take this:" that then a tribune, by name Cornelius Sabinus, another of the conspirators,
ran him through the breast.  Others say, that the crowd being kept at a distance by some centurions
who were in the plot, Sabinus came, according to custom, for the word, and that Caius gave
him "Jupiter," upon which Chaerea cried out, "Be it so!" and then, on his looking round, clove
one of his jaws with a blow.  As he lay on the ground, crying out that he was still alive [463],
the rest dispatched him with thirty wounds.  For the word agreed upon among them all was, "Strike
again."  Some likewise ran their swords through his privy parts.  Upon the first bustle, the
litter bearers came running in with their poles to his assistance, and, immediately afterwards,
his German body guards, who killed some of the assassins, and also some senators who had no
concern in the affair.

LIX.  He lived twenty-nine years, and reigned three years, ten months, and eight days. She is really
had a miscarriage, the fifth to marriage. She asked me as nothing could be done to disable her
were to carry a lightning term, that both they and her husband were then be full to have offspring.
 Before this was
done, it is well known that the keepers of the gardens were greatly disturbed by apparitions;
and that not a night passed without some terrible alarm or other in the house where he was
slain, until it was destroyed by fire.  His wife Caesonia was killed with him, being stabbed
by a centurion; and his daughter had her brains knocked out against a wall.

LX.  Of the miserable condition of those times, any person (292) may easily form an estimate
from the following circumstances.  When his death was made public, it was not immediately credited.
People entertained a suspicion that a report of his being killed had been contrived and spread
by himself, with the view of discovering how they stood affected towards him.  Nor had the
conspirators fixed upon any one to succeed him.  The senators were so unanimous in their resolution
to assert the liberty of their country, that the consuls assembled them at first not in the
usual place of meeting, because it was named after Julius Caesar, but in the Capitol.  Some
proposed to abolish the memory of the Caesars, and level their temples with the ground.  It
was particularly remarked on this occasion, that all the Caesars, who had the praenomen of
Caius, died by the sword, from the Caius Caesar who was slain in the times of Cinna.
