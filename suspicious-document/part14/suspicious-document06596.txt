His researches in biology, his contributions to scientific controversy, his pungent criticisms
of conventional beliefs and thoughts have probably had greater influence than the work of any
other English scientist. And yet he was a "self-made" intellectualist. In spite of the fact
that his father was a schoolmaster he passed through no regular course of education. "I had,"
he said, "two years of a pandemonium of a school (between eight and ten) and after that neither
help nor sympathy in any intellectual direction till I reached manhood." When he was twelve
a craving for reading found satisfaction in Hutton's "Geology," and when fifteen in Hamilton's
"Logic."

At seventeen Huxley entered as a student at Charing Cross Hospital, and three years later he
was M.B. and the possessor of the gold medal for anatomy and physiology. An appointment as
surgeon in the navy proved to be the entry to Huxley's great scientific career, for he was
gazetted to the "Rattlesnake", commissioned for surveying work in Torres Straits. He was attracted
by the teeming surface life of tropical seas and his study of it was the commencement of that
revolution in scientific knowledge ultimately brought about by his researches.

Thomas Henry Huxley was born at Ealing on May 4, 1825, and died at Eastbourne June 29, 1895.

LECTURES AND ESSAYS BY T.H. HUXLEY

ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSES OF THE PHENOMENA OF ORGANIC NATURE

NOTICE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

The Publisher of these interesting Lectures, having made an arrangement for their publication
with Mr. J. A. Mays, the Reporter, begs to append the following note from Professor Huxley:--

"Mr. J. Aldous Mays, who is taking shorthand notes of my 'Lectures to Working Men,' has asked
me to allow him, on his own account, to print those Notes for the use of my audience. I willingly
accede to this request, on the understanding that a notice is prefixed to the effect that I
have no leisure to revise the Lectures, or to make alterations in them, beyond the correction
of any important error in a matter of fact."

THE PRESENT CONDITION OF ORGANIC NATURE.

When it was my duty to consider what subject I would select for the six lectures [*To Working
Men, at the Museum of Practical Geology, 1863.] which I shall now have the pleasure of delivering
to you, it occurred to me that I could not do better than endeavour to put before you in a
true light, or in what I might perhaps with more modesty call, that which I conceive myself
to be the true light, the position of a book which has been more praised and more abused, perhaps,
than any book which has appeared for some years;--I mean Mr. Darwin's work on the "Origin of
Species". That work, I doubt not, many of you have read; for I know the inquiring spirit which
is rife among you. At any rate, all of you will have heard of it,--some by one kind of report
and some by another kind of report; the attention of all and the curiosity of all have been
probably more or less excited on the subject of that work. All I can do, and all I shall attempt
to do, is to put before you that kind of judgment which has been formed by a man, who, of course,
is liable to judge erroneously; but, at any rate, of one whose business and profession it is
to form judgments upon questions of this nature.

And here, as it will always happen when dealing with an extensive subject, the greater part
of my course--if, indeed, so small a number of lectures can be properly called a course--must
be devoted to preliminary matters, or rather to a statement of those facts and of those principles
which the work itself dwells upon, and brings more or less directly before us. I have no right
to suppose that all or any of you are naturalists; and even if you were, the misconceptions
and misunderstandings prevalent even among naturalists on these matters would make it desirable
that I should take the course I now propose to take,--that I should start from the beginning,--that
I should endeavour to point out what is the existing state of the organic world,--that I should
point out its past condition,--that I should state what is the precise nature of the undertaking
which Mr. Darwin has taken in hand; that I should endeavour to show you what are the only methods
by which that undertaking can be brought to an issue, and to point out to you how far the author
of the work in question has satisfied those conditions, how far he has not satisfied them,
how far they are satisfiable by man, and how far they are not satisfiable by man.

To-night, in taking up the first part of this question, I shall endeavour to put before you
a sort of broad notion of our knowledge of the condition of the living world. There are many
ways of doing this. I might deal with it pictorially and graphically. Following the example
of Humboldt in his "Aspects of Nature", I might endeavour to point out the infinite variety
of organic life in every mode of its existence, with reference to the variations of climate
and the like; and such an attempt would be fraught with interest to us all; but considering
the subject before us, such a course would not be that best calculated to assist us. In an
argument of this kind we must go further and dig deeper into the matter; we must endeavour
to look into the foundations of living Nature, if I may so say, and discover the principles
involved in some of her most secret operations. I propose, therefore, in the first place, to
take some ordinary animal with which you are all familiar, and, by easily comprehensible and
obvious examples drawn from it, to show what are the kind of problems which living beings in
general lay before us; and I shall then show you that the same problems are laid open to us
by all kinds of living beings. But first, let me say in what sense I have used the words "organic
nature." In speaking of the causes which lead to our present knowledge of organic nature, I
have used it almost as an equivalent of the word "living," and for this reason,--that in almost
all living beings you can distinguish several distinct portions set apart to do particular
things and work in a particular way. These are termed "organs," and the whole together is called
"organic." And as it is universally characteristic of them, this term "organic" has been very
conveniently employed to denote the whole of living nature,--the whole of the plant world,
and the whole of the animal world.

Few animals can be more familiar to you than that whose skeleton is shown on our diagram. You
need not bother yourselves with this "Equus caballus" written under it; that is only the Latin
name of it, and does not make it any better. It simply means the common Horse. Suppose we wish
to understand all about the Horse. Our first object must be to study the structure of the animal.
The whole of his body is inclosed within a hide, a skin covered with hair; and if that hide
or skin be taken off, we find a great mass of flesh, or what is technically called muscle,
being the substance which by its power of contraction enables the animal to move. These muscles
move the hard parts one upon the other, and so give that strength and power of motion which
renders the Horse so useful to us in the performance of those services in which we employ him.

And then, on separating and removing the whole of this skin and flesh, you have a great series
of bones, hard structures, bound together with ligaments, and forming the skeleton which is
represented here.

In that skeleton there are a number of parts to be recognized. The long series of bones, beginning
from the skull and ending in the tail, is called the spine, and those in front are the ribs;
and then there are two pairs of limbs, one before and one behind; and there are what we all
know as the fore-legs and the hind-legs. If we pursue our researches into the interior of this
animal, we find within the framework of the skeleton a great cavity, or rather, I should say,
two great cavities,--one cavity beginning in the skull and running through the neck-bones,
along the spine, and ending in the tail, containing the brain and the spinal marrow, which
are extremely important organs. The second great cavity, commencing with the mouth, contains
the gullet, the stomach, the long intestine, and all the rest of those internal apparatus which
are essential for digestion; and then in the same great cavity, there are lodged the heart
and all the great vessels going from it; and, besides that, the organs of respiration--the
lungs: and then the kidneys, and the organs of reproduction, and so on. Let us now endeavour
to reduce this notion of a horse that we now have, to some such kind of simple expression as
can be at once, and without difficulty, retained in the mind, apart from all minor details.
If I make a transverse section, that is, if I were to saw a dead horse across, I should find
that, if I left out the details, and supposing I took my section through the anterior region,
and through the fore-limbs, I should have here this kind of section of the body (Fig. 1). Here
would be the upper part of the animal--that great mass of bones that we spoke of as the spine
(a, Fig. 1). Here I should have the alimentary canal (b, Fig. 1). Here I should have the heart
(c, Fig. 1); and then you see, there would be a kind of double tube, the whole being inclosed
within the hide; the spinal marrow would be placed in the upper tube (a, Fig. 1), and in the
lower tube (d d, Fig. 1), there would be the alimentary canal (b), and the heart (c); and here
I shall have the legs proceeding from each side. Why assume that the master
was to risk losing many valuable items to decorate our house? Why assume that an institution
so important, could accept the risk of discrediting in one hour, assuming a robbery or murder?

I prefer that they had these wooden balconies, prefer that the pedestrians did not have continuous
temptation to see two balconies at his disposal, two balconies that can be played hand, but
saw that this is a normal occurrence here, I seem so outlandish and so ridiculous to want
something else, as it would be in Constantinople to pretend that every house was not an enchanted
palace.

Anyway, my wife went to bed, obedience, and not close her eyes until it was observed late in
the day. But after we get used to the new life, so much the money as watches were on the table
or on the cabinet, almost in sight of what will happen down the street.

Needless to say that nobody came out to dispossess or to kill us.

We have crossed several times throughout Paris, never to have had news of an armed robbery,
a murder, a mob of any kind. We have only witnessed a fight between two men in the street of
Buenavista (Beauregard), riot that lasted a moment and had no unpleasant
consequences.

Treatment, weights, measures, food, everything fits perfectly to law.

Other trends studied in Paris, just conceived, or conceived is conceived as a prodigy, the existence
of such scrupulous level between social behavior is due, and will
of charge.

This level is evident, and only ignorance, the prejudice or hatred can not know.

We have studied with great care the face of the Parisian civilization,
and we must say very rarely seen a public demonstration of the individual,
is in disagreement with the rule of society, ie, written laws.

There are those who have attributed this result to the vigilance of the police, but this way judge
is not the most seasoned reveals knowledge of things.

The police, like any act of repression, can avoid special cases, local
accidents and time, not produce a general case, unanimously, with
rare exceptions.

This is a provision general mood and manners not to hurt the property, as this property is guaranteed
by a formal proclamation of the law.

For this arrangement of the minds and morals was a result of monitoring
police, was that each individual must have a spotter so attached to
him as walking to their mark, which would lead us to suppose the existence
of so many spies as citizens.

This is absurd.

When a people is so immoral that each of your children need not be a spy for murderer or thief, no
human forces that prevent the individual from that company is a thief or murderer. The spy can
not do anything but add to the sum a new numeral. The citizen criminal would need an accomplice, the
accomplice would be his own guardian, the police, espionage. The intelligence, then, would
serve only to give authority to the crimes, or to succumb in the
struggle.

Yes, the police would have to be an accomplice, or robbed and murdered by the thief and by the
murderer.

Who could doubt it?

When a cancer is taking over all our body where you will find meat healthy meat oppose to cancer?
If the cancer is everywhere, if it must be cut However, at what point concebís life? How concebís
life in a meat to be cut?

This can not be and may not be in any country in the world, there is no reason to be in Paris. No,
not the police. Police are in Austria, and crime is incomparably
higher.

England holds the police today less the French Empire, and England is moderated a country more than
France. Belgian police have less, much less, and customs of that
country are far better than the people who examine. In a similar case
found the Netherlands, some German states, the Free Cities and Switzerland.

Sardinia
is under police Naples, Naples is more criminal than in a proportion
Sardinia fabulous. The blood is contained in a vast system of pipes, spreading through
the whole body, connected with a force pump,--the heart,--which, by its position and by the
contractions of its valves, keeps the blood constantly circulating in one direction, never
allowing it to rest; and then, by means of this circulation of the blood, laden as it is with
the products of digestion, the skin, the flesh, the hair, and every other part of the body,
draws from it that which it wants, and every one of these organs derives those materials which
are necessary to enable it to do its work.

The action of each of these organs, the performance of each of these various duties, involve
in their operation a continual absorption of the matters necessary for their support, from
the blood, and a constant formation of waste products, which are returned to the blood, and
conveyed by it to the lungs and the kidneys, which are organs that have allotted to them the
office of extracting, separating, and getting rid of these waste products; and thus the general
nourishment, labour, and repair of the whole machine is kept up with order and regularity.
But not only is it a machine which feeds and appropriates to its own support the nourishment
necessary to its existence--it is an engine for locomotive purposes. The Horse desires to go
from one place to another; and to enable it to do this, it has those strong contractile bundles
of muscles attached to the bones of its limbs, which are put in motion by means of a sort of
telegraphic apparatus formed by the brain and the great spinal cord running through the spine
or backbone; and to this spinal cord are attached a number of fibres termed nerves, which proceed
to all parts of the structure. By means of these the eyes, nose, tongue, and skin--all the
organs of perception--transmit impressions or sensations to the brain, which acts as a sort
of great central telegraph-office, receiving impressions and sending messages to all parts
of the body, and putting in motion the muscles necessary to accomplish any movement that may
be desired. So that you have here an extremely complex and beautifully-proportioned machine,
with all its parts working harmoniously together towards one common object--the preservation
of the life of the animal.

Now, note this: the Horse makes up its waste by feeding, and its food is grass or oats, or
perhaps other vegetable products; therefore, in the long run, the source of all this complex
machinery lies in the vegetable kingdom. But where does the grass, or the oat, or any other
plant, obtain this nourishing food-producing material? At first it is a little seed, which
soon begins to draw into itself from the earth and the surrounding air matters which in themselves
contain no vital properties whatever; it absorbs into its own substance water, an inorganic
body; it draws into its substance carbonic acid, an inorganic matter; and ammonia, another
inorganic matter, found in the air; and then, by some wonderful chemical process, the details
of which chemists do not yet understand, though they are near foreshadowing them, it combines
them into one substance, which is known to us as 'Protein,' a complex compound of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen, which alone possesses the property of manifesting vitality and of permanently
supporting animal life. So that, you see, the waste products of the animal economy, the effete
materials which are continually being thrown off by all living beings, in the form of organic
matters, are constantly replaced by supplies of the necessary repairing and rebuilding materials
drawn from the plants, which in their turn manufacture them, so to speak, by a mysterious combination
of those same inorganic materials.

Let us trace out the history of the Horse in another direction. After a certain time, as the
result of sickness or disease, the effect of accident, or the consequence of old age, sooner
or later, the animal dies. The multitudinous operations of this beautiful mechanism flag in
their performance, the Horse loses its vigour, and after passing through the curious series
of changes comprised in its formation and preservation, it finally decays, and ends its life
by going back into that inorganic world from which all but an inappreciable fraction of its
substance was derived. Its bones become mere carbonate and phosphate of lime; the matter of
its flesh, and of its other parts, becomes, in the long run, converted into carbonic acid,
into water, and into ammonia. You will now, perhaps, understand the curious relation of the
animal with the plant, of the organic with the inorganic world, which is shown in this diagram
(Fig. 3).

The plant gathers these inorganic materials together and makes them up into its own substance.
The animal eats the plant and appropriates the nutritious portions to its own sustenance, rejects
and gets rid of the useless matters; and, finally, the animal itself dies, and its whole body
is decomposed and returned into the inorganic world. There is thus a constant circulation from
one to the other, a continual formation of organic life from inorganic matters, and as constant
a return of the matter of living bodies to the inorganic world; so that the materials of which
our bodies are composed are largely, in all probability, the substances which constituted the
matter of long extinct creations, but which have in the interval constituted a part of the
inorganic world.

Thus we come to the conclusion, strange at first sight, that the MATTER constituting the living
world is identical with that which forms the inorganic world. And not less true is it that,
remarkable as are the powers or, in other words, as are the FORCES which are exerted by living
beings, yet all these forces are either identical with those which exist in the inorganic world,
or they are convertible into them; I mean in just the same sense as the researches of physical
philosophers have shown that heat is convertible into electricity, that electricity is convertible
into magnetism, magnetism into mechanical force or chemical force, and any one of them with
the other, each being measurable in terms of the other,--even so, I say, that great law is
applicable to the living world. Let me as I am. Is it OK and
the tie? Go a few niceties. Marvel's what I say: I lived fifteen years without seeing a mirror,
or whatever it is, without seeing the face and not knowing how I am.

- Jesus, what a man ... And finally one day and said you looked like
Caspe: "Other than God, I know that face ...».

Do you hear, Amparo?

They both laughed.

Agustin Caballero was no longer young, but without the fatigue and
toil of a hard life party were over the years in physical decline,
expressing his face. In his beard black shining silver threads unevenly
distributed, because under the temples dominated almost completely
gray hair, while his mustache and everything that fell under the lower
lip was black. In this way the nervous action is related to electricity in the same
way that heat is related to electricity; and the same sort of argument which demonstrates the
two latter to be related to one another shows that the nervous forces are correlated to electricity;
for the experiments of M. Dubois Reymond and others have shown that whenever a nerve is in
a state of excitement, sending a message to the muscles or conveying an impression to the brain,
there is a disturbance of the electrical condition of that nerve which does not exist at other
times; and there are a number of other facts and phenomena of that sort; so that we come to
the broad conclusion that not only as to living matter itself, but as to the forces that matter
exerts, there is a close relationship between the organic and the inorganic world--the difference
between them arising from the diverse combination and disposition of identical forces, and
not from any primary diversity, so far as we can see.

I said just now that the Horse eventually died and became converted into the same inorganic
substances from whence all but an inappreciable fraction of its substance demonstrably originated,
so that the actual wanderings of matter are as remarkable as the transmigrations of the soul
fabled by Indian tradition. But before death has occurred, in the one sex or the other, and
in fact in both, certain products or parts of the organism have been set free, certain parts
of the organisms of the two sexes have come into contact with one another, and from that conjunction,
from that union which then takes place, there results the formation of a new being. At stated
times the mare, from a particular part of the interior of her body, called the ovary, gets
rid of a minute particle of matter comparable in all essential respects with that which we
called a cell a little while since, which cell contains a kind of nucleus in its centre, surrounded
by a clear space and by a viscid mass of protein substance (Fig. 2); and though it is different
in appearance from the eggs which we are mostly acquainted with, it is really an egg. After
a time this minute particle of matter, which may only be a small fraction of a grain in weight,
undergoes a series of changes,--wonderful, complex changes. Finally, upon its surface there
is fashioned a little elevation, which afterwards becomes divided and marked by a groove. The
lateral boundaries of the groove extend upwards and downwards, and at length give rise to a
double tube. In the upper smaller tube the spinal marrow and brain are fashioned; in the lower,
the alimentary canal and heart; and at length two pairs of buds shoot out at the sides of the
body, which are the rudiments of the limbs. In fact a true drawing of a section of the embryo
in this state would in all essential respects resemble that diagram of a horse reduced to its
simplest expression, which I first placed before you (Fig. 1).

Slowly and gradually these changes take place. The whole of the body, at first, can be broken
up into "cells," which become in one place metamorphosed into muscle,--in another place into
gristle and bone,--in another place into fibrous tissue,--and in another into hair; every part
becoming gradually and slowly fashioned, as if there were an artificer at work in each of these
complex structures that we have mentioned. This embryo, as it is called, then passes into other
conditions. I should tell you that there is a time when the embryos of neither dog, nor horse,
nor porpoise, nor monkey, nor man, can be distinguished by any essential feature one from the
other; there is a time when they each and all of them resemble this one of the Dog. But as
development advances, all the parts acquire their speciality, till at length you have the embryo
converted into the form of the parent from which it started. So that you see, this living animal,
this horse, begins its existence as a minute particle of nitrogenous matter, which, being supplied
with nutriment (derived, as I have shown, from the inorganic world), grows up according to
the special type and construction of its parents, works and undergoes a constant waste, and
that waste is made good by nutriment derived from the inorganic world; the waste given off
in this way being directly added to the inorganic world; and eventually the animal itself dies,
and, by the process of decomposition, its whole body is returned to those conditions of inorganic
matter in which its substance originated.

This, then, is that which is true of every living form, from the lowest plant to the highest
animal--to man himself. You might define the life of every one in exactly the same terms as
those which I have now used; the difference between the highest and the lowest being simply
in the complexity of the developmental changes, the variety of the structural forms, the diversity
of the physiological functions which are exerted by each.

If I were to take an oak tree as a specimen of the plant world, I should find that it originated
in an acorn, which, too, commenced in a cell; the acorn is placed in the ground, and it very
speedily begins to absorb the inorganic matters I have named, adds enormously to its bulk,
and we can see it, year after year, extending itself upward and downward, attracting and appropriating
to itself inorganic materials, which it vivifies, and eventually, as it ripens, gives off its
own proper acorns, which again run the same course. But I need not multiply examples,--from
the highest to the lowest the essential features of life are the same, as I have described
in each of these cases.

So much, then, for these particular features of the organic world, which you can understand
and comprehend, so long as you confine yourself to one sort of living being, and study that only.

But, as you know, horses are not the only living creatures in the world; and again, horses,
like all other animals, have certain limits--are confined to a certain area on the surface
of the earth on which we live,--and, as that is the simpler matter, I may take that first.
In its wild state, and before the discovery of America, when the natural state of things was
interfered with by the Spaniards, the Horse was only to be found in parts of the earth which
are known to geographers as the Old World; that is to say, you might meet with horses in Europe,
Asia, or Africa; but there were none in Australia, and there were none whatsoever in the whole
continent of America, from Labrador down to Cape Horn. This is an empirical fact, and it is
what is called, stated in the way I have given it you, the 'Geographical Distribution' of the
Horse.

Why horses should be found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and not in America, is not obvious;
the explanation that the conditions of life in America are unfavourable to their existence,
and that, therefore, they had not been created there, evidently does not apply; for when the
invading Spaniards, or our own yeomen farmers, conveyed horses to these countries for their
own use, they were found to thrive well and multiply very rapidly; and many are even now running
wild in those countries, and in a perfectly natural condition. Now, suppose we were to do for
every animal what we have here done for the Horse,--that is, to mark off and distinguish the
particular district or region to which each belonged; and supposing we tabulated all these
results, that would be called the Geographical Distribution of animals, while a corresponding
study of plants would yield as a result the Geographical Distribution of plants.

I pass on from that now, as I merely wished to explain to you what I meant by the use of the
term 'Geographical Distribution.' As I said, there is another aspect, and a much more important
one, and that is, the relations of the various animals to one another. The Horse is a very
well-defined matter-of-fact sort of animal, and we are all pretty familiar with its structure.
I dare say it may have struck you, that it resembles very much no other member of the animal
kingdom, except perhaps the Zebra or the Ass. But let me ask you to look along these diagrams.
Here is the skeleton of the Horse, and here the skeleton of the Dog. You will notice that we
have in the Horse a skull, a backbone and ribs, shoulder-blades and haunch-bones. In the fore-limb,
one upper arm-bone, two fore arm-bones, wrist-bones (wrongly called knee), and middle hand-bones,
ending in the three bones of a finger, the last of which is sheathed in the horny hoof of the
fore-foot: in the hind-limb, one thigh-bone, two leg-bones, anklebones, and middle foot-bones,
ending in the three bones of a toe, the last of which is encased in the hoof of the hind-foot.
Now turn to the Dog's skeleton. We find identically the same bones, but more of them, there
being more toes in each foot, and hence more toe-bones.

Well, that is a very curious thing! The fact is that the Dog and the Horse--when one gets a
look at them without the outward impediments of the skin--are found to be made in very much
the same sort of fashion. And if I were to make a transverse section of the Dog, I should find
the same organs that I have already shown you as forming parts of the Horse. Well, here is
another skeleton--that of a kind of Lemur--you see he has just the same bones; and if I were
to make a transverse section of it, it would be just the same again. In your mind's eye turn
him round, so as to put his backbone in a position inclined obliquely upwards and forwards,
just as in the next three diagrams, which represent the skeletons of an Orang, a Chimpanzee,
a Gorilla, and you find you have no trouble in identifying the bones throughout; and lastly
turn to the end of the series, the diagram representing a man's skeleton, and still you find
no great structural feature essentially altered. There are the same bones in the same relations.
From the Horse we pass on and on, with gradual steps, until we arrive at last at the highest
known forms. On the other hand, take the other line of diagrams, and pass from the Horse downwards
in the scale to this fish; and still, though the modifications are vastly greater, the essential
framework of the organization remains unchanged. Here, for instance, is a Porpoise: here is
its strong backbone, with the cavity running through it, which contains the spinal cord; here
are the ribs, here the shoulder blade; here is the little short upper-arm bone, here are the
two forearm bones, the wrist-bone, and the finger-bones.

Strange, is it not, that the Porpoise should have in this queer-looking affair--its flapper
(as it is called), the same fundamental elements as the fore-leg of the Horse or the Dog, or
the Ape or Man; and here you will notice a very curious thing,--the hinder limbs are absent.
Now, let us make another jump. Let us go to the Codfish: here you see is the forearm, in this
large pectoral fin--carrying your mind's eye onward from the flapper of the Porpoise. And here
you have the hinder limbs restored in the shape of these ventral fins. If I were to make a
transverse section of this, I should find just the same organs that we have before noticed.
So that, you see, there comes out this strange conclusion as the result of our investigations,
that the Horse, when examined and compared with other animals, is found by no means to stand
alone in nature; but that there are an enormous number of other creatures which have backbones,
ribs, and legs, and other parts arranged in the same general manner, and in all their formation
exhibiting the same broad peculiarities.

I am sure that you cannot have followed me even in this extremely elementary exposition of
the structural relations of animals, without seeing what I have been driving at all through,
which is, to show you that, step by step, naturalists have come to the idea of a unity of plan,
or conformity of construction, among animals which appeared at first sight to be extremely
dissimilar. Then
you can build the flight outdoors, Ã¡ rays of the Sun, does. But do well or badly? I do not
know; do not want to know it, or find out, or even hear it. I know that the prisoner loves
freedom; I know that who is dark Ã¡ loves the light; I know who lives sandwich, you want to stretch
their members, want to move, shake, breathe; I know that you want Christian, with a frenetic Ã¡nsia,
with a providential instinct. Parents who think otherwise are deceived, and a thousand misfortunes
that happen every day, are real and positive, less than the lightness of the children, that of
the deception of the parents. Take away the birdseed, so live locked in the cage! Not; This is
not to have children; that is to be captives or slaves; that isn't to be parents; that is to be
guards. And what love wants a father the son you have, what respect wants the son he professes,
how to apply that son venere le and ETA you, when there is Ã¡ him as father, but as comity,
as a tyrant?as a jailer?

I beg Ã¡ parents, believe that they heard, and that answer; not that I answer of Word, not that
I answer not written; but that respond Ã¡ does own his conscience
and his heart.

His son is a man; a man who was born to love, how to love his father was born. This son loves his
will, under a higher instinct Ã¡ Ã¡ their ideas, Ã¡ his power; higher power, Ã¡ Ã¡ and ideas from around
the world will.

What are trying to parents against that instinct? Can not remove the instinct of the soul of
their children, as they can not remove the mountains, or wipe dry
them seas; what they try against the sea and the mountains?

Love comes as come pests, storms, hurricanes; as the light falls from the stars; as the air runs through
the atmosphere. What are trying to parents against the mystery of
life?

What do they want to make the environment does not run, and the hurricane did not blow, and
light does not fall, and contagion not infested, and Thunder not explode? What they are against
the hurricane, against contagion, against the environment and against
the light?

His son loves by a providential law; by a law of divine origin. God has given, he has it because
God gives: what tries to the father against what God? What plans conceived against Providence that governs
all Ã¡, Ã¡ him also? Here come the parents think so, and to respond.

Nothing more absurd, more more repugnant barbarian played Ã¡ a father the Holy law of the Council
of the persuasion, of tears, to anger, because many times we angry by what we want, for the sake
that look forward to the objects of our love; but any way can be Ã¡ a father the power to make a
law of violence, abuse, of an attack. There is no right to do what is not, for the reason that
there is no legitimate abuse, moral crimes. A betrayal, a true betrayal, not is never fair. None of violence,
especially violence being put on a passion of our soul, a passion great, immense, divine; above all,
in a time of our life in which the passion enters so that the passion is almost all, because
the youth is nothing more than a passion. I advise Ã¡ children humility,
respect, obedience; more than obedience; veneration, a deep and religious
veneration. A parent is you must not only obey, but venerate; I advise
a children the veneration; but not advised a parental violence And
you must understand that I have not been talking mere theory; I have been speaking of matters
which are as plainly demonstrable as the commonest propositions of Euclid--of facts that must
form the basis of all speculations and beliefs in Biological science. We have gradually traced
down all organic forms, or, in other words, we have analyzed the present condition of animated
nature, until we found that each species took its origin in a form similar to that under which
all the others commence their existence. We have found the whole of the vast array of living
forms, with which we are surrounded, constantly growing, increasing, decaying and disappearing;
the animal constantly attracting, modifying, and applying to its sustenance the matter of the
vegetable kingdom, which derived its support from the absorption and conversion of inorganic
matter. And so constant and universal is this absorption, waste, and reproduction, that it
may be said with perfect certainty that there is left in no one of our bodies at the present
moment a millionth part of the matter of which they were originally formed! We have seen, again,
that not only is the living matter derived from the inorganic world, but that the forces of
that matter are all of them correlative with and convertible into those of inorganic nature. 

Augustine had grown tired of his tedious life in Madrid and so in October that year he went to Bordeaux
where he had business to attend to.
He returned from Bordeaux unexpectedly early and when asked simply
stated "there I was bored more".

In the next lecture I shall endeavour in the same way to go back into the past, and to sketch
in the same broad manner the history of life in epochs preceding our own.
