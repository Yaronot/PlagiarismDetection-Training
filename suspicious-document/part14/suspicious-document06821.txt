FIVE SERMONS

BY THE RT. REV. H.B. WHIPPLE, D.D., LL.D. BISHOP OF MINNESOTA

1890

PREFACE

My only excuse for printing these sermons is the request of friends who could not secure copies
of them.  They are printed as delivered, and the repetition of incidents was a part of the
historical statement.  The Third and Fifth Sermons were preached without notes and reported
by a stenographer. H.B.W.

I.  SERMON AT THE OPENING SERVICES OF THE GENERAL CONVENTION,
    OCTOBER 2, 1889. I.

Brethren: I shall take it for granted that there is a visible Church; that it was founded by
Our Lord Jesus Christ, and has His promise that the gates of hell shall never prevail against
it.  We believe that ours is a pure branch of the apostolic Church; that it has a threefold
ministry; that its two sacraments--Baptism and the Supper of the Lord--are of perpetual obligation,
and are divine channels of grace; that the faith once delivered to the saints is contained
in the Catholic creeds, and has the warrant of Holy Scripture which was written by inspiration
of God.  On this centennial day I shall speak of the history and mission of this branch of
the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ.

It was a singular providence that this continent, laden with the bounty of God, was unoccupied
by civilization for thousands of years.  America was discovered by a devout son of the Latin
Church, whose name-- Christopher, Christ-bearer, and Columbus, the dove--ought to have been
the prophecy that he would bear the Gospel to the New World.  It was at a time when Savonarola,
with the zeal of a prophet of God and the eloquence of a Chrysostom, was laboring to awaken
the Church to a new life.  No nation ever had a nobler mission than Spain. And how can they be
alone appreciated if they are not understood? But a country who is hardly for expected where
there is not a appreciation of political nations, which i give to continent was speaking as their
truths. I reverently believe that it was because they recognize as no other
people the two truths which underlie the possibility of constitutional government, i.e., the
inalienable rights of the individual citizen, and loyalty to government as a delegated trust
from God, who alone has the right to govern.  These lessons are intertwined with two thousand
years of history.  They reach back to the days when the savage Briton came in contact with
Roman civilization and Roman law, and have been deepened by centuries of Christian influences
which have changed our savage fathers into truth-speaking, liberty-loving Christian men.
