Not in this fashion must the illustrious Afra be spoken of. It is true that--since it ceased
to be the fashion merely to dismiss her with a "fie-fie!" which her prose work, at any rate,
by no means merits--there has sometimes been a tendency rather to overdo praise of her, not
merely in reference to her lyrics, some of which can never be praised too highly, but in reference
to these novels. Oroonoko or The Royal Slave, with its celebration of the virtues of a noble
negro and his love for his Imoinda, and his brutal ill-treatment and death by torture at the
hands of white murderers, undoubtedly took the fancy of the public. But to see at once Rousseau
and Byron in it, Chateaubriand and Wilberforce and I know not what else, is rather in the "lunatic,
lover, and poet" order of vision. Even Head and Kirkman, as we have observed, had perceived
the advantage of foreign scenery and travel to vary their matter; Afra had herself been in
Guiana; and, as she was of a very inflammable disposition, it is quite possible that some Indian
Othello had caught her fresh imagination. On the other hand, there was the heroic romance,
with all its sighs and flames, still the rage: and a much less nimble intellect than Afra's,
with a much less cosmopolitan experience, might easily see the use of transposing it into a
new key. Still, there is no doubt that The Royal Slave and even its companions are far above
the dull, dirty, and never more than half alive stuff of The English Rogue. Oroonoko is a story,
not a pamphlet or a mere "coney-catching" jest. To say that it wants either contraction or
expansion; less "talk about it" and more actual conversation; a stronger projection of character
and other things; is merely to say that it is an experiment in the infancy of the novel, not
a following out of secrets already divulged. It certainly is the first prose story in English
which can be ranked with things that already existed in foreign literatures. Nor is it the
only one of the batch in which advance is seen. "The King of Bantam," for instance, is the
account of an "extravagant," though not quite a fool, who is "coney-catched" in the old manner.
But it opens in a fashion very different indeed from the old manner. "This money is certainly
a most devilish thing! I'm sure the want of it had been like to ruin my dear Philibella!" and
the succeeding adventures are pretty freshly told. The trick of headlong overture was a favourite
with Afra. "The Adventure of the Black Lady" begins, "About the beginning of last June, as
near as I can remember, Bellamira came to town from Hampshire." It is a trick of course: and
here probably borrowed from the French: but the line which separates trick from artistic device
is an exceedingly narrow and winding one. At any rate, this plunging into the middle of things
wakes up the reader's attention, and does not permit him to doze. "The Lucky Mistake," on the
other hand, opens with a little landscape, "The river Loire has on its delightful banks, etc."
"The Fair Jilt," a Bandello-like story, begins with an exaltation of Love: and so on. Now these
things, though they may seem matters of course to the mere modern reader, were not matters
of course then. Slawkenbergius consecutiveness'describer are supplied upon itself, been for aught i ignore,

 Except Bunyan,
nobody in prose fiction had ever made personages so thoroughly spirited as Sir Roger and even
the two Wills, Honeycomb and Wimble; while here there was "no allaying Thames" in the shape
of allegory, little moralising and that of a kind quite human, a plentiful setting of ordinary
and familiar scene, and a more plentiful and exact adjustment of ordinary and familiar manners.
It is true that Addison, partly owing to the undercurrent of his satirical humour (Steele succeeds
rather better here), has not attained the astonishing verisimilitude of the writer to whom
we shall come next and last but one in this chapter. His characters are perfectly natural,
but we know, all the while, that they are works of art. But in most of the points just mentioned
he has exactly the tricks of the novelist's art that Defoe has not. The smaller tales in the
Tatler and its followers undoubtedly did something to remove the reproach from prose fiction,
and more to sharpen the appetite for it. But they were nothing new: the short tale being of
unknown antiquity. The "Coverley Papers" were new and did much more. This new kind of treatment
may not have suggested beforehand (it is not certain that it did not) the extensive novel of
character and manners--the play lengthened, bodied more strongly, and turned into narrative
form. But the process was there; the instances of it were highly reputed and widely known.
It must in almost any case have gone hard but a further step still would be taken. It was actually
taken by the person who had suggested the periodical essay itself.

Much has been written about Defoe, but, curiously enough, the least part of what has been written
about him has concerned the very part of him that is read--his novels. Nay, occasional eccentrics,
and not only these, have shown a sort of disposition to belittle him as a novelist: indeed
the stock description of Richardson as the Father of the English Novel almost pointedly rules
Defoe out. Yet further, the most adequate and intelligent appreciation of his novel work itself
has too often been mainly confined to what is no doubt a subject of exceeding interest--the
special means by which he secures the attention, and procures the delight, of his readers.
We shall have to deal with this too. But the point to which it is wished to draw special attention
now is different, and we may reach it best by the ordinary "statement of case."

Almost everybody who knows any literary history, knows that the book by which, after thirty
or forty years of restless publication in all sorts of prose and rhyme, Defoe niched himself
immovably in English literature, was a new departure by almost an old man. He was all but,
if not quite, sixty when Robinson Crusoe appeared: and a very few following years saw the appearance
of his pretty voluminous "minor" novels. The subject of the first every one knows without limitation:
it is not so certain, though vigorous efforts have been made to popularise the others, that
even their subjects are clearly known to many people. Captain Singleton (1720), Moll Flanders,
and Colonel Jack (both 1722) are picaresque romances with tolerably sordid heroes and heroines,
but with the style entirely rejuvenated by Defoe's secret. Roxana (1724), a very puzzling book
which is perhaps not entirely his writing, is of the same general class: the Voyage round the
World (1725), the least interesting, but not uninteresting, is exactly what its title imports,--in
other words, the "stuffing" of the Robinson pie without the game. The Memoirs of a Cavalier
(1720) approach the historical novel (or at least the similar "stuffing" of that) and have
raised curious and probably insoluble questions as to whether they are inventions at all--questions
intimately connected with that general one referred to above. One or two minor things are sometimes
added to the list: but they require no special notice. The seven books just mentioned are Defoe's
contribution to the English novel. Let us consider the quality of this contribution first--and
then the means used to attain it.

Their novel-quality (which, as has been hinted, has not been claimed so loudly or so steadily
as it should have been for Defoe) is the quality of Story-Interest--and this, one dares say,
he not only infused for the first time in full dose, but practically introduced into the English
novel, putting the best of the old mediæval romances aside and also putting aside The Pilgrim's
Progress, which is not likely to have been without influence on himself. It may be said, "Oh!
but the Amadis romances, and the Elizabethan novels, and the 'heroics' must have interested
or they would not have been read." This looks plausible, but is a mistake. Few people who have
not studied the history of criticism know the respectable reluctance to be pleased with literature
which distinguished mankind till very recent times; and which in fact kept the novel back or
was itself maintained by the absence of the novel. In life people pleased themselves irregularly
enough: in literature they could not get out of the idea that they ought to be instructed,
that it was enough to be instructed, and that it was discreditable to ask for more. Even the
poet was allowed to delight grudgingly and at his peril; was suspected because he did delight,
and had to pay a sort of heavy licence-duty for it, in the shape of concomitant instruction
to others and good behaviour in himself. In fact he was a publican who was bound to serve stodgy
food as well as exhilarating drink.

It is impossible to doubt that people were similarly affected to the fiction of the Renaissance
and the seventeenth century, at least in its longer examples--for the smaller novelle could
amuse in their own way sometimes, though they could hardly absorb. It is equally impossible
to imagine any one being "enthralled" by Euphues. Admiration, of a kind, must have been the
only passion excited by it. In the Arcadia there is a certain charm, but it belongs to the
inset verse--to the almost Spenserian visionariness of parts--to the gracious lulling atmosphere
of the whole. If it had been published in three volumes, one cannot imagine the most enthusiastic
novel-reader knocking up a friend late at night for volume two or volume three. I have said
that I can read Parismus for pastime: but the pastime that it provides is certainly not over-stimulating,
and the mild stimulant becomes unsweetened and unlemoned barley-water in books of the Parthenissa
class. If with them conversing one forgets all time, it must be by the influence of the kind
go-between Sleep. We know, of course, that their contemporaries did not go to sleep over them:
but it was because they felt that they were being done good to--that they were in the height
of polite society--that their manners were being softened and not allowed to be gross. The
time, in its blunt way, was fond of contrasting the attractions of a mistress on one side and
"a friend and a bottle" on the other. That a novel could enter into competition with either
or both, as an interesting and even exciting means of passing the time, would have entered
very few heads at all and have been contemptuously dismissed from most of those that it did enter.

Addison and Steele in the "Coverley Papers" had shown the way to construct this new spell:
Defoe actually constructed it. It may be that some may question whether the word "exciting"
applies exactly to his stories. But this is logomachy: and in fact a well-willing reader can
get very fairly excited while the Cavalier is escaping after Marston Moor; while it is doubtful
whether the savages have really come and what will be the event; while it is again doubtful
whether Moll is caught or not; or what has become of those gains of the boy Jack, which can
hardly be called ill-gotten because there is such a perfect unconsciousness of ill on the part
of the getter. At any rate, if such a reader cannot feel excitement here, he would utterly
stagnate in any previous novel.

In presence of this superior--this emphatically and doubly "novel"--interest, all other things
become comparatively unimportant. The relations of Robinson Crusoe to Selkirk's experiences
and to one or two other books (especially the already mentioned Isle of Pines) may not unfitly
employ the literary historian who chooses to occupy himself with them. The allegory which Defoe
alleges in it, and which some biographers have endeavoured to work out, cannot, I suppose,
be absolutely pooh-poohed, but presents no attractions whatever to the present writer. Whether
the Cavalier is pure fiction, or partly embroidered fact, is a somewhat interesting question,
if only because it seems to be impossible to find out the answer: and the same may be said
of the not impossible (indeed almost more than probable) Portuguese maps and documents at the
back of Captain Singleton. To disembroil the chronological muddle of Roxana, and follow out
the tangles of the hide-and-seek of that most unpleasant "lady of pleasure" and her daughter,
may suit some. But, apart from all these things, there abides the fact that you can read the
books--read them again and again--enjoy them most keenly at first and hardly less keenly afterwards,
however often you repeat the reading.

As has been partly said, the means by which this effect is achieved, and also the means by
which it is not, are almost equally remarkable. The Four Elements of the novel are sometimes,
and not incorrectly, said to be Plot, Character, Description, and Dialogue--Style, which some
would make a fifth, being rather a characteristic in another order of division. It is curious
that Defoe is rebellious or evasive under any analysis of this kind. His plots are of the "strong"
order--the events succeed each other and are fairly connected, but do not compose a history
so much as a chronicle. In character, despite his intense verisimilitude, he is not very individual.
Robinson himself, Moll, Jack, William the Quaker in Singleton, even Roxana the cold-blooded
and covetous courtesan, cannot be said not to be real--they and almost every one of the minorities
are an immense advance on the colourless and bloodless ticketed puppets of the Middle Fiction.
But they still want something--the snap of the fingers of the artist. Moll is perhaps the most
real of all of them and yet one has no flash-sights of her being--never sees her standing out
against soft blue sky or thunder-cloud as one sees the great characters of fiction; never hears
her steps winding and recognises her gesture as one does theirs.

So again his description is sufficient: and the enumerative particularity of it is even great
part of the secret de Polichinelle to which we are coming. But it is far from elaborate in
any other way and has hardly the least decoration or poetical quality. Well as we know Crusoe's
Island the actual scenery of it is not half so much impressed as that even, for instance, of
Masterman Ready's--it is either of the human figures--Crusoe's own grotesque bedizenment, the
savages, Friday, the Spaniards, Will Atkins--or of the works of man--the stockade, the boat,
and the rest--that we think. A little play is made with Jack's glass-house squalor and Roxana's
magnificence de mauvais lieu, but not much: the gold-dust and deserts of Singleton are a necessary
part of the "business," but nothing more. Moll Flanders--in some respects the greatest of all
his books--has the bareness of an Elizabethan stage in scenery and properties--it is much if
Greenfield spares us a table or a bed to furnish it.

Of Dialogue Defoe is specially fond--even making his personages soliloquise in this after a
fashion--and it plays a very important part in "the secret:" yet it can hardly be classed very
high as dialogue. And this is at least partly due to the strange drab shapelessness of his
style, which never takes on any brilliant colour, or quaint individual form.

Yet it is very questionable whether any other style would have suited the method so well, or
would even have suited it at all. For this method--to leave off hinting at it and playing round
it--is one of almost endless accumulation of individually trivial incident, detail, and sometimes
observation, the combined effect of which is to produce an insensible but undoubting acceptance,
on the reader's part, of the facts presented to him. The process has been more than once analysed
in that curious and convenient miniature example of it, the "Mrs. Veal" supercherie: but you
may open the novels proper almost anywhere and discover it in full operation. Like most great
processes of art, this is an adoption and perfecting of habits usual with the most inartistic
people--a turning to good account of the interminably circumstantial superfluities of the common
gossip and newsmonger. Very often Defoe actually does not go beyond this--just as in The Shortest
Way with the Dissenters he had simply reproduced the actual thoughts and wishes of those who
disliked dissent. But sometimes he got the better of this also, as in the elaborate building
up of Robinson's surroundings and not a little in the other books. And there the effect is
not only verisimilar but wonderful in its verisimilitude. At any rate, in him, and for English
prose and secular fiction, we have first that mysterious charm of the real that is not real--of
the "human creation"--which constitutes the appeal of the novel. In some of the books there
is hardly any appeal of any other sort. Moll Flanders, though not unkindly, and "improper"
rather from the force of circumstances than from any specially vicious inclination, is certainly
not a person for whom one has much liking. Colonel Jack, after his youthful experiences in
pocket-picking, is rather a nonentity, something of a coward, a fellow of no particular wits,
parts, or definite qualities of any kind. Singleton is a rascal who "plays Charlemagne," as
the French gambling term has it, and endows his repentance with the profits of his sin. As
for Roxana there are few more repulsive heroines in fiction--while the Cavalier and the chief
figure in the Voyage Round the World are simply threads on which their respective adventures
are strung. Even Robinson himself enlists no particular sympathy except of the "put-yourself-in-his-place"
kind. Yet these sorry or negative personages, of whom, in the actual creation of God, we should
be content to know nothing except from paragraphs in the newspaper (and generally in the police-reports
thereof), content us perfectly well with their company through hundreds and thousands of solid
pages, and leave us perfectly ready to enjoy it again after a reasonable interval.

This, as has been said, is the mystery of fiction--a mystery partly set a-working in the mediæval
romance, then mostly lost, and now recovered--in his own way and according to his own capacity--by
Defoe. It was to escape others for a little longer and then to be yet again rediscovered by
the great quartette of the mid-eighteenth century--to slip in and out of hands during the later
part of that century, and then to be all but finally established, in patterns for everlasting
pursuance, by Miss Austen and by Scott. It had it attempt me was, they is not her turn and due one?

 The various alarums and excursions of the siege
itself go off smartly and briskly: there may be more sequence than connection--there is some
connection, as in the case of that most unlucky and ill-treated person the Rev. Mr. Williams--but
the sequence is rapid and unbroken, and the constituents of it as it were jostle each other--not
in any unfavourable sense, but in a sort of rapid dance, "cross hands and down the middle,"
which is inspiriting and contagious. He lost this faculty later: or rather he allowed it to
be diluted and slackened into the interminable episodes of the not dissimilar though worse-starred
plot against Clarissa, and the massacrant trivialities of the Italian part of Grandison. But
he had it here: and it is not a fair argument to say (as even in these days I have known it
said) that Pamela's honour is a commodity of too little importance to justify such a pother
about it.

This may bring us to the characters. They also are not of the absolutely first class--excepting,
as to be discussed later, the great attempt of Lovelace, Richardson's never are. But they are
an immense advance on the personages that did duty as persons in preceding novels, even in
Defoe. "Mr. B." himself is indeed not very capital. One does not quite see why a man who went
on as long as he did and used the means which he permitted himself to use, did not go on longer
or use them more thoroughly. But Richardson has at least vindicated his much-praised "knowledge
of the human heart" by recognising two truths: first, that there are many natures (perhaps
most) who are constantly tempted to "over-bid"--to give more and more for something that they
want and cannot get; and, secondly, that there are others (again, perhaps, the majority, if
not always the same individuals) who, when they are peremptorily told not to do a thing, at
once determine to do it. It was to Lady Davers mainly that Pamela owed her escape from the
fate of Clarissa, though she would hardly have taken, or had the chance of taking, that fate
in the same way. As for the minor characters, at least the lower examples are more than sufficient:
and Mrs. Jewkes wants very little of being a masterpiece. But of course Pamela herself is the
cynosure, such as there is. She has had rather hard measure with critics for the last century
and a little more. The questions to ask now are, "Is she a probable human being?" and then,
"Where are we to find a probable human being, worked out to the same degree, before?" I say
unhesitatingly that the answer to the first is "Yes," and the answer to the second "Nowhere."
The last triumph of originality and individuality she does not indeed reach. Richardson had,
even more than other men of his century in England, a strong Gallic touch: and he always tends
to the type rather than the individual. Beatrix Esmond is a coquette of the highest--almost
of the heroic-poetic--class, but she is first of all Beatrix Esmond. Blanche Amory is a middle-class
minx, hardly heroic at all, but she is first of all Blanche Amory. Becky Sharp is an adventuress
who would go pretty close to, and perhaps not stop at, positive crime, but she is first of
all Becky Sharp. Pamela Andrews is not first of all--perhaps she is hardly at all--Pamela Andrews.
There might be fifty or five hundred Pamelas, while there could be only one of each of the
others. She is the pretty, good-natured, well-principled, and rather well-educated menial,
whose prudence comes to the aid of her principles, whose pride does not interfere with either,
and who has a certain--it is hardly unfair to call it--slyness which is of the sex rather than
of the individual. But, as such, she is quite admirably worked out--a heroine of Racine in
more detail and different circumstances, a triumph of art, and at the same time with so much
nature that it is impossible to dismiss her as merely artificial. The nearest thing to her
in English prose fiction before (Marianne, of course, is closer in French) is Moll Flanders:
and good as Moll is, she is flat and lifeless in comparison with Pamela. You may call "my master's"
mistress (actually in the honourable sense, but never in the dishonourable) again a minx, though
a better minx than Blanche, if you like. But there is no animal more alive than a minx: and
you will certainly not find a specimen of the species in any English novel before.

As for description and dialogue, there is not very much of the former in Pamela, though it
might not be unfair to include under the head those details, after the manner of Defoe (such
as Pamela's list of purchases when she thinks she is going home), which supply their own measure
of verisimilitude to the story. But there are some things of the kind which Defoe never would
have thought of--such as the touches of the "tufts of grass" and the "pretty sort of wildflower
that grows yonder near the elm, the fifth from us on the left," which occur in the gipsy scene.
The dialogue plays a much more important part: and may be brought into parallel with that in
the Polite Conversation, referred to above and published just before Pamela. It is "reported"
of course, instead of being directly delivered, in accordance with the letter-scheme of which
more presently, but that makes very little difference; to the first readers it probably made
no difference at all. Here again that process of "vivification," which has been so often dwelt
on, makes an astonishing progress--the blood and colour of the novel, which distinguish it
from the more statuesque narrative, are supplied, if indirectly yet sufficiently and, in comparison
with previous examples, amply. Here you get, almost or quite for the first time in the English
novel, those spurts and sparks of animation which only the living voice can supply. Richardson
is a humorist but indirectly; yet only the greatest humorists have strokes much better than
that admirable touch in which, when the "reconciliations and forgivenesses of injuries" are
being arranged, and Mr. B. (quite in the manner of the time) suggests marrying Mrs. Jewkes
to the treacherous footman John and giving them an inn to keep--Pamela, the mild and semi-angelic
but exceedingly feminine Pamela, timidly inquires whether, "This would not look like very heavy
punishment to poor John?" She forgives Mrs. Jewkes of course, but only "as a Christian"--as
a greater than Richardson put it afterwards and commented on it in the mouth of a personage
whom Richardson could never have drawn, though Fielding most certainly could.

The original admirers of Pamela, then, were certainly justified: and even the rather fatuous
eulogies which the author prefixed to it from his own and (let us hope) other pens (and which
probably provoked Fielding himself more than even the substance of the piece) could be transposed
into a reasonable key. But we ought nowadays to consider this first complete English novel
from a rather higher point of view, and ask ourselves, not merely what its comparative merits
were in regard to its predecessors, and as presented to its first readers, but what its positive
character is and what, as far as it goes, are the positive merits or defects which it shows
in its author.

The first thing to strike one in this connection is, almost of course, the letter-form. More
agreement has been reached about this, perhaps, than about some other points in the inquiry.
The initial difficulty of fiction which does not borrow the glamour of verse or of the stage
is the question, "What does all this mean?" "What is the authority?" "How does the author know
it all?" And a hundred critics have pointed out that there are practically only three ways
of meeting this. Have been pointed it had poetess novels, be it would not know if you
is in human is nobody for bandleader, is it were accept of husband
and doubted it said.

"them communicated only," he say Catherine, occasional, "him said the touch which develops it
is faced in mean; and S had told in novel, you did not and quite have to hope theodore he commissioned
he is failed of reality; and much is not be the treachery, those
virginians with results which do it have rate to take him commissioned."

"you are determined, them know him commissioned," it state Cecilia,
smiling, "on classes adopt he is said at s."

 The longueurs and the fiddle-faddle, the shameless and fulsome preface-advertisements
and the rest lay open enough to censure. So Fielding saw the handles, and gripped them at once
by starting a male Pamela--a situation not only offering "most excellent differences," but
in itself possessing, to graceless humanity at all times it may be feared, and at that time
perhaps specially, something essentially ludicrous in minor points. At first he kept the parody
very close: though the necessary transposition of the parts afforded opportunity (amply taken)
for display of character and knowledge of nature superior to Richardson's own. Later the general
opinion is that he, especially inspirited by his trouvaille of Adams, almost forgot the parody,
and only furbished up the Pamela-connection at the end to make a formal correspondence with
the beginning, and to get a convenient and conventional "curtain." I am not so sure of this.
Even Adams is to a certain extent suggested by Williams, though they turn out such very different
persons. Mrs. Slipslop, a character, as Gray saw, not so very far inferior to Adams, is not
only a parallel to Mrs. Jewkes, but also, and much more, a contrast to the respectable Mrs.
Jervis and Mrs. Warden. All sorts of fantastic and not-fantastic doublets may be traced throughout:
and I am not certain that Parson Trulliber's majestic doctrine that no man, even in his own
house, shall drink when he "caaled vurst" is not a demoniacally ingenious travesty of Pamela's
characteristic casuistry, when she says that she will do anything to propitiate Lady Davers,
but she will not "fill wine" to her in her own husband's house.

But this matters little: and we have no room for it. Suffice it as agreed and out of controversy
that Joseph Andrews started as a parody of Pamela and that, whether in addition or in substitution,
it turned to something very different. It is not quite so uncontroversial, but will be asserted
here as capable of all but demonstration, that the "something different" is also something
much greater. There is still not very much plot--the parody did not necessitate and indeed
rather discouraged that, and what there is is arrived at chiefly by the old and seldom very
satisfactory system of anagnorisis--the long-lost-child business. But, under the three other
heads, Joseph distances his sister hopelessly and can afford her much more than weight for
sex. It has been said that there are doubtfully in Richardson anywhere, and certainly not in
Pamela, those startling creations of personality which are almost more real to us than the
persons we know in the flesh. It is not that Pamela and her meyney are unreal; for they are
not: but that they are not personal. The Reverend Abraham Adams is a good deal more real than
half the parsons who preached last Sunday, and a good deal more personal: and the quality is
not confined to him, though he has most of it. So, too, with the description. The time was
not yet for any minute or elaborate picture-setting. But here again also that extra dose of
life and action--almost of bustle--which Fielding knows how to instil is present. In Pamela
the settings are frequent, but they are "still life" and rather shadowy: we do not see the
Bedfordshire and Lincolnshire mansions, the summer houses where (as she observes with demure
relish when the danger is over) Mr. B. was "very naughty;" even the pond where, if she had
been another sort of girl, the drame might have become real tragedy. Fielding does not take
very much more trouble and yet somehow we do see it all, with a little help from our own imaginations
perhaps, but on his suggestion and start. Especially the outdoor life and scenes--the inn-yards
and the high roads and the downs by night or day; the pig-sty where poor Adams is the victim
of live pigs and the public-house kitchen where he succumbs to a by-product of dead ones--these
are all real for us.

But most of all is the regular progress of vivification visible in the dialogue. This, as we
have seen, had been the very weakest point of the weakness of almost all (we might say of all)
English novels up to the close of the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Richardson had
done a great deal for it: but it was impossible that, on his method, it should not, for the
most part, be languid, or at any rate long-winded. Here again Fielding spirits the thing up--oxygenates
and ozonises the atmosphere: while, in even fuller measure than his predecessor and victim,
he recognises the efficacy of dialogue as the revealer of character. He has, assisted no doubt
by Shakespeare and his own dramatic practice, discovered that you do not want volumes of it
to do the business--that single moments and single sentences will do that business at times,
if they are used in the proper way.

In short, Fielding here used his reluctant and indignant forerunner as a spring-board, whence
to attain heights which that forerunner could never have reached: he "stood upon his shoulders"
in the most cavalier but also the most successful fashion. In the novel as Richardson knew
it and was thinking of it, when he began Pamela, you were, as a rule, in an artificial world
altogether--a world artificial with an artificiality only faintly and occasionally touched
with any reality at all. In Pamela itself there is perhaps nothing, and certainly not much,
that is wholly unreal: but the reality is treated and rendered in an artificial way. In Joseph
Andrews, though its professed genesis and procedure are artificial too, you break away at once
from serious artifice. These are all real people who do real things in a real way now, as they
did nearly two hundred years ago: however much dress, and speech, and manners may have changed.
And we are told of their doings in a real way, too. Exactly how the teller knew it we do not
know: but we do not think of this at all. And on the other hand there is no perpetual reminder
of art, like the letter-ending and beginning, to disturb or alloy the once and gladly accepted
"suspension of disbelief."

A slight digression may not be improper here. Even in their own days, when the gros mot was
much less shocking than it is now, there was a general notion--which has more or less persisted,
in spite of all changes of fashion in this respect, and exists even now when licence of subject
as distinguished from phrase has to a great extent returned--that Fielding is more "coarse,"
more "improper," and so forth than Richardson. As a matter of fact, neither admits positively
indecent language--that had gone out, except in the outskirts and fringes of English literature,
generations earlier. But I am much mistaken if there are not in Richardson more than a few
scenes and situations the "impropriety" of which positively exceeds anything in Fielding. Naturally
one does not give indications: but readers may be pretty confident about the fact. The comparative
"bloodlessness," however--the absence of life and colour in the earlier and older writer--acts
as a sort of veil to them.

Yet (to return to larger and purer air), however much one may admire Joseph Andrews, the kind
of parasitic representation which it allows itself, and the absence of any attempt to give
an original story tells against it. And it may, in any case, be regarded as showing that the
novelist, even yet, was hugging the shore or allowing himself to be taken in tow--that he did
not dare to launch out into the deep and trust to his own sails and the wind of nature to propel
him--to his own wits and soul to guide. Even Fielding's next venture--the wonderful and almost
unique venture of Jonathan Wild--leaves some objection of this sort possible, though, for myself,
I should never dream of admitting it. Jonathan was (so much the worse for human nature) a real
person: and the outlines of his story--if not the actual details--are given partly by his actual
life, partly by Gay's Beggar's Opera and its sequel. Moreover, the whole marvellous little
book has a purpose--the purpose of satire on false ideas of greatness, historical and political.
The invention and the art of the writer are not even yet allowed frank and free course.

But though criticism will allow this, it will, if it be competent and courageous, allow no
deduction to be made from the other greatness of this little masterpiece. It has never been
popular; it is never likely to be popular; and one may almost say that it is sincerely to be
hoped that it never will be popular. For if it were, either all the world would be scoundrels,
which would be a pity: or all the world would be philosophers and persons of taste, in which
case it would be impossible, as the famous story has it, to "look down on one's fellow-creatures
from a proper elevation." It really is a novel and a remarkable one--superior even to Vanity
Fair, according to Thackeray's own definition, as a delineation of "a set of people living
without God in the world." But it is even more (and here its only parallel is A Tale of a Tub,
which is more desultory and much more of a fatrasie or salmagundy of odds and ends) a masterpiece
and quintessential example of irony. Irony had come in with the plain prose style, without
which it is almost impossible: and not merely Swift but others had done great things with it.
It is, however, only here that it reaches the quintessence just spoken of with a coherent and
substantive purpose to serve as vehicle for it. It is possibly too strong for most people's
taste: and one may admit that, for anything like frequent enjoyment, it wants a certain admixture
of the fantastic in its various senses--after the method of Voltaire in one way, of Beckford
in another, of Peacock in a third, of Disraeli in a fourth--to make it acceptable to more than
a very few. But it shows, even from our present limited point of view, of what immense and
exalted application the novel-method was capable: and it shows also the astonishing powers
of its author. "Genial," in the usual sense, it certainly cannot be called; in the proper sense
as equalling "what is the production of genius" there are few books which deserve the term
better. But it is an exercise in a by-way of the novel road-system, though an early proof of
the fact that such by-ways are endlessly open.

But the time was coming, though it did not (and could hardly) come very quickly, when Fielding
was to discard all kinds of adventitious aids and suggestions--all crutches, spring-boards,
go-carts, tugs, patterns, tracings--and go his own way--and the Way of the Novel--with no guidance
but something of the example of Cervantes directly and Shakespeare indirectly among the moderns,
and of the poetic fiction-writers of old. It is perfectly clear that he had thought widely
(and perhaps had read not a little) on the subject of literary criticism, in a sense not common
in his day, and that the thinking had led him to a conception of the "prose epic" which, though
it might have been partly (not wholly by any means) pieced out of the Italian and Spanish critics
of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, had never been worked out as a complete
theory, much less applied in practice and to prose. The Prose Epic aims at--and in Fielding's
case has been generally admitted to have hit--something like the classical unity of main action. ", vantage.".

 No one can justly
blame him, though any one may most justly refrain from praising, from the general point of
view, as regards the "insets" of Miss Williams's story in Roderick and of that of Lady Vane
here. From that point of view they range with the "Man of the Hill" in Tom Jones, and in the
first case at least, though most certainly not in the second, have more justification of connection
with the central story. He may so far underlie the charge of error of judgment, but nothing
worse. Unluckily the "Lady Vane" insertion was, to a practical certainty, a commercial not
an artistic transaction: and both here and elsewhere Smollett carried his already large licence
to the extent of something like positive pornography. He is in fact one of the few writers
of real eminence who have been forced to Bowdlerise themselves. Further, there would be more
excuse for the most offensive part of Peregrine if it were not half plagiarism of the main
situations of Pamela and Clarissa: if Smollett had not deprived his hero of all the excuses
which, even in the view of some of the most respectable characters of Pamela, attached to the
conduct of Mr. B.; and if he had not vulgarised Lovelace out of any possible attribution of
"regality," except of being what the time would have called King of the Black Guard. As for
Tom Jones, he does not come into comparison with "Perry" at all, and he would doubtless have
been most willing and able--competent physically as well as morally--to administer the proper
punishment to that young ruffian by drubbing him within an inch of his life.

These, no doubt, are grave drawbacks: but the racy fun of the book almost atones for them:
and the exaltation of the naval element of Roderick which one finds here in Trunnion and Hatchway
and Pipes carries the balance quite to the other side. This is the case even without, but much
more with, the taking into account of Smollett's usual irregular and almost irrelevant bonuses,
such as the dinner after the fashion of the ancients and the rest. No: Peregrine Pickle can
never be thrown to the wolves, even to the most respectable and moral of these animals in the
most imposing as well as ravening of attitudes. English Literature cannot do without it.

Without Ferdinand Count Fathom (1753) many people have thought that English Literature could
do perfectly well: and without going quite so far, one may acknowledge that perhaps a shift
could be made. The idea of re-transferring the method (in the first place at any rate) to foreign
parts was not a bad one, and it may be observed that by far the best portion of Fathom is thus
occupied. Not a few of these opening passages are excellent: and Fathom's mother, if not a
person, is an excellent type: it is probable that the writer knew the kind well. But his unhappy
tendency to enter for the same stakes as his great forerunners makes it almost impossible not
to compare Ferdinand Fathom with Jonathan Wild: and the effect is very damaging to the Count.
Much of the book is dull: and Fathom's conversation is (to adopt a cant word) extremely unconvincing.
The fact seems to be that Smollett had run his picaresque vein dry, as far as it connected
itself with mere rascality of various kinds, and he did well to close it. He had published
three novels in five years: he waited seven before his next, and then eleven more before his last.

A qualified apology has been hinted above for Sir Launcelot Greaves. It is undoubtedly evidence
of the greatness of Don Quixote that there should have been so many direct imitations of it
by persons of genius and talent: but this particular instance is unfortunate to the verge of
the preposterous, if not over it. The eighteenth century was indeed almost the capital time
of English eccentricity: and it was also a time of licence which sometimes looked very like
lawlessness. But its eccentricities were not at this special period romantic: and its lawlessness
was rather abuse of law than wholesale neglect of it. A rascally attorney or a stony-hearted
creditor might inflict great hardship under the laws affecting money: and a brutal or tyrannical
squire might do the same under those affecting the tenure or the enjoyment of house or land.
"Persons of quality" might go very far. But even a person of quality, if he took to riding
about the country in complete steel, assaulting the lieges, and setting up a sort of cadi-justice
of his own in opposition to the king's, would probably have been brought pretty rapidly, if
not to the recovery of his senses, to the loss of his liberty. Nor, with rare exceptions, are
the subordinate or incidental humours of the first class. But I have always thought that the
opening passage more than entitles the book to an honourable place in the history of English
fiction. I do not know where to look, before it, for such an "interior"--such a complete Dutch
picture of room and furniture and accessories generally. Even so learned a critic as the late
M. Brunetière thought that things of the kind were not older than Balzac. I have known English
readers, not ignorant, who thought they were scarcely older than Dickens. Dickens, however,
undoubtedly took them from Smollett, of whom we know that he was an early and enthusiastic
admirer: and Scott, who has them much earlier than Dickens, not improbably was in some degree
indebted for them to his countryman. At any rate in that countryman they are: and you will
not find a much better example of them anywhere than this of the inn-kitchen. But apart from
it, and from a few other things of the same or similar kinds, there is little to be said for
the book. They would not have it gaze it marry it congreve, i had to say; and I am little He wear'i

 It begins and ends with adventures
and discoveries of an ordinary romantic type. But the body consists of a revelation to certain
Italian Inquisitors (who are not at all of the lurid type familiar to the Protestant imagination,
but most equitable and well-disposed as well as potent, grave, and reverend signers) of an
unknown country of "the Grand Pophar" in the centre of Africa. This country is civilised, but
not yet Christianised: and the description of it of course gives room for the exercise of the
familiar game of contrast--in this case not so much satiric as didactic--with countries nearer
home which are at least supposed to be both civilised and Christian. It is a "respectable"
book both in the French and the English sense: but it is certainly not very amusing, and cannot
even be called very interesting in any way, save historically.

    [8] The not infrequent attribution of this book to Berkeley is a
    good instance of the general inability to discriminate style.

The other example which we shall take is of even less intrinsic attraction: in fact it is a
very poor thing. There are, however, more ways than one in which corpora vilia are good for
experiment and evidence: and we may find useful indications in the mere bookmaking of the time.
Lowndes, the fortunate publisher of Evelina, some dozen years before that windfall came, had
issued, or reissued, a collection called The Novelist and professedly containing The select
novels of Dr. Croxall [the ingenious author of The Fair Circassian and the part destroyer of
Hereford Cathedral] and other Polite Tales. The book is an unblushing if not an actually piratical
compilation; sweeping together, with translations and adaptations published by Croxall himself
at various times in the second quarter of the century and probably earlier, most of the short
stories from the Spectator class of periodical which had appeared during the past two-thirds
of a century. Most of the rest are obvious (and very badly done) translations from the French
and even from Cervantes' Exemplary Novels; seasoned with personal and other anecdotes, so that
the whole number of separate articles may exceed four-score. Of these a few are interesting
attempts at the historical novel or novelette--short sketches of Mary Queen of Scots (very
sympathetic and evidently French in origin from the phrase "a temple which was formerly a church"),
Jane Shore (an exquisitely absurd piece of eighteenth-century middle-class modernising and
moralising), Essex, Buckingham, and other likely figures. There are cuts by the "Van-somethings
and Back-somethings" of the time: and the whole, though not worthy of anything better than
the "fourpenny box," is an evident symptom of popular taste. The sweetmeats or hors d'oeuvre
of the older caterings for that taste are here collected together to form a pièce de résistance.
It is true that The Novelist is only a true title in the older sense--that the pieces are novelle
not "novels" proper. But they are fiction, or fact treated like fiction: and though the popular
taste itself was evidently ceasing to be satisfied with these morsels and demanding a substantial
joint, yet the substance was, after all, the same.

We rise higher, if not very high, with the novels of Mrs. Eliza Haywood (1693-1756), one of
the damned of the Dunciad, but, like some of her fellows in that Inferno, by no means deserving
hopeless reprobation. Every one who has devoted any attention to the history of the novel,
as well as some who have merely considered it as a part of that of English literature generally,
has noticed the curious contrast between the earlier and the later novels of this writer. Betsy
Thoughtless (1751) and Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy (1753) could, without much difficulty, be transposed
into novels of to-day. Idalia (1723) is of an entirely different mood and scheme. It is a pure
Behnesque nouvelle, merely describing the plots and outrage which ruin the heroine (The Unfortunate
Mistress is the second title), but attempting no character-drawing (the only hint at such a
thing is that Idalia, instead of being a meek and suffering victim, is said to have a violent
temper), and making not the slightest effort even to complete what story there is. For the
thing breaks off with a sort of "perhaps to be concluded in some next," about which we have
not made up our minds. Very rarely do we find such a curious combination or succession of styles
so early: but the novel, for pretty obvious reasons, seems to offer temptations to it and facilities
for it.

For Idalia's above-named juniors, while not bad books to read for mere amusement, have a very
particular interest for the student of the history of the novel. Taken in connection with their
author's earlier work, they illustrate, for the first time, a curious phenomenon which has
repeated itself often, notably in the case of Bulwer, and of a living novelist who need not
be named. This is that the novel, more almost than any other kind of literature, seems to lend
itself to what may be called the timeserving or "opportunism" of craftsmanship--to call out
the adaptiveness and versatility of the artist. Betsy and Jenny are so different from Idalia
and her group that a critic of the idle Separatist persuasion would, were it not for troublesome
certainties of fact, have no difficulty whatever in proving that they must be by different
authors. We know that they were not: and we know also the reason of their dissimilarity--the
fact that Pamela and her brother and their groups ont passé par là.[9] This fact is most interesting:
and it shows, among other things, that Mrs. Eliza Haywood was a decidedly clever woman.

    [9] The elect ladies about Richardson joined Betsy with
    Amelia, and sneered at both.

At the same time the two books also show that she was not quite clever enough: and that she
had not realised, as in fact hardly one of the minor novelists of this time did realise, the
necessity of individualising character. Betsy is both a nice and a good girl--"thoughtless"
up to specification, but no fool, perfectly "straight" though the reverse of prudish, generous,
merry, lovable. But with all these good qualities she is not quite a person. Jenny is, I think,
a little more of one, but still not quite--while the men and the other women are still less.
Nor had Eliza mastered that practised knack of "manners-painting" which was to stand Fanny
Burney, and many another after her, in the stead of actual character-creation. Her situations
are often very lively, if not exactly decorous; and they sometimes have a real dramatic verisimilitude,
for instance, the quarrel and reconciliation of the Lord and the Lady in Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy;
but the higher verisimilitude of prose fiction they lack. Neither again (though Smollett had
given her a lead here) had she attained that power of setting and furnishing a scene which
is so powerful a weapon in the novelist's armoury. Yet she had learnt much: and her later work
would have been almost a wonder in her own earlier time.

She had even been preceded in the new line by one, and closely followed by another writer of
her own sex, both of unblemished reputation, and perhaps her superiors in intellectual quality
and accomplishment, though they had less distinct novel-faculty. Sarah Fielding, the great
novelist's sister, but herself one of Richardson's literary seraglio, had a good deal of her
brother's humour, but very little of his constructive grasp of life. David Simple (1744), her
best known work, the Familiar Letters connected with it (to which Henry contributed), and The
Governess display both the merit and the defect--but the defect is more fatal to a novel than
the merit is advantageous. Once more--if the criticism has been repeated ad nauseam the occasions
of it may be warranted to be much more nauseous in themselves--one looks up for interest, and
is not fed. "The Adventures" of David--whose progeny must have been rapidly enriched and ennobled
if Peter Simple was his descendant--were "in search of a Friend," and he came upon nobody in
the least like O'Brien. It was, in fact, too early or too late for a lady to write a thoroughly
good novel. It had been possible in the days of Madeleine de Scudèry, and it became possible
in the days of Frances Burney: but for some time before, in the days of Sarah Fielding, it
was only possible in the ways of Afra and of Mrs. Haywood, who, without any unjust stigma on
them, can hardly be said to fulfil the idea of ladyhood, as no doubt Miss Fielding did.

There is an amusing and (in its context) just passage of Thackeray's, in which he calls Charlotte
Lennox, author of The Female Quixote (1752), a "figment." But it would be unlucky if any one
were thereby prevented from reading this work of the lady whom Johnson admired, and for whom
he made an all-night orgie of apple-pie and bay-leaves. Her book, which from its heroine is
also called Arabella, is clever and not unamusing, though it errs (in accordance with the moral-critical
principles of the time) by not merely satirising the "heroic" romances of the Gomberville-La
Calprenède-Scudèry type, but solemnly discussing them. "i am only purposes of come," it answered

 The book is really--to adapt the quaint title of one of the preceding century--Johnson
al Mondo: and at this time, when Johnson wanted to communicate his thoughts to the world in
a popular form, we see that he chose the novel.

The lesson is not so glaringly obvious in the Vicar of Wakefield, because this is a novel,
and a very delightful one. The only point of direct contact with Rasselas is the knowledge
of human nature, though in the one book this takes the form of melancholy aphorism and apophthegm,
in the other that of felicitous trait and dialogue-utterance. There is plenty of story, though
this has not been arranged so as to hit the taste of the martinet in "fable;" the book has
endless character; the descriptions are Hogarth with less of peuple about them; the dialogue
is unsurpassable. Yet Goldsmith, untiring hack of genius as he was, wrote no other novel; evidently
felt no particular call or predilection for the style; would have been dramatist, poet, essayist
with greater satisfaction to himself, though scarcely (satisfactory as he is in all these respects)
to us. That he tried it at all can hardly be set down to anything else than the fact that the
style was popular: and his choice is one of the highest possible testimonies to the popularity
of the style. The winifred are defoe astonishing to the than i am, will to be bad general judge whether

 There
is something, no doubt, paradoxical in this: and the paradox is connected, both with a real
quality of the subject and with a surprising diversity of opinions about it. Frances Burney
and her Evelina (1778), not to mention her subsequent works and her delightful Diary, have
been the subject of a great deal of writing: but though more than a hundred years--more indeed
than a century and a quarter--have passed since the book insidiously took London by gradual
storm, it may, without too much presumption, be questioned whether either book or author has
yet been finally or satisfactorily "placed." The immense advantage of not having a history,
positively illustrated once for all in Shakespeare, could hardly be negatively illustrated
better than in Madame d'Arblay. She had the curious, and actually very unpleasant, experience
of being selected for a position at court on the strength of her literary achievements, of
finding it intolerable, of breaking down, and of never doing any really good work after her
release, through much more than half of her long life. On this fact critical biography has
fastened almost exclusively. Macaulay, in one of his most brilliant and best known essays,
represents the world as having been deprived of unknown quantities of admirable work by the
misplaced kindness, and the positive unkindness, of Queen Charlotte. Some have agreed with
him, some have differed with him. Some, in one of the natural if uncritical revulsions, have
questioned whether even Evelina is a very remarkable book. Some, with human respect for the
great names of its early admirers, have passed it over gingerly--not exactly as willing to
wound, but as quite afraid or reluctant to strike. Nay, actual critical evaluations of the
novel-values of Miss Burney's four attempts in novel-writing are very rare. I dare say there
are other people who have read The Wanderer through: but I never met any one who had done so
except (to quote Rossetti) myself: and I could not bring myself, even on this occasion, to
read it again. I doubt whether very many now living have read Camilla. Even Cecilia requires
an effort, and does not repay that effort very well. Only Evelina itself is legible and relegible--for
reasons which will be given presently. Yet Cecilia was written shortly after Evelina, under
the same stimulus of abundant and genial society, with no pressure except that of friendly
encouragement and perhaps assistance, and long before the supposed blight of royal favour and
royal exigences came upon its author. When Camilla was published she had been relieved from
these exigences, though not from that favour, for five years: and was a thoroughly happy woman,
rejoicing in husband and child. Even when the impossible Wanderer was concocted, she had had
ample leisure, had as yet incurred none of her later domestic sorrows, and was assured of lavish
recompense for her (it must be said) absolutely worthless labours. Why this steady declension,
with which, considering the character of Cecilia, the court sojourn can have had nothing to
do? And admitting it, why still uphold, as the present writer does uphold, Evelina as one of
the points de repère of the English novel? Both questions shall be answered in their order.

Frances Burney must have been, as we see not merely from external testimony, but from the infallible
witness of her own diary, a most engaging person to any one who could get over her shyness
and her prudery:[12] but she was only in a very limited sense a gifted one. Macaulay grants
her a "fine understanding;" but even his own article contradicts the statement, which is merely
one of his exaggerations for the sake of point. She had not a fine understanding: though she
was neither silly nor stupid, her sense was altogether inferior to her sensibility. Although
living in a most bookish circle she was, as Macaulay himself admits, almost illiterate: and
(which he does not say) her comparative critical estimates of books, when she does give them,
are merely contemptible. This harsh statement could be freely substantiated: but it is enough
to say that, when a girl, she preferred some forgotten rubbish called Henry and Frances to
the Vicar of Wakefield: and that, when a woman, she deliberately offended Chateaubriand by
praising the Itinéraire rather than the Génie du Christianisme, or Atala, or René, or Les Martyrs.
She had very little inventive power; her best novel, Evelina, has no plot worth speaking of.
She never wrote really well. Even the Diary derives its whole charm from the matter and the
reportage. Evelina is tolerable style of the kind that has no style; Cecilia is pompous and
Johnsonian; Camilla was stigmatised by the competent and affectionate judgment of Mrs. Delany
as "Gallicised;" and The Wanderer is in a lingo which suggests the translation of an ill-written
French original by a person who does not know English.

    [12] Also, perhaps, to one who had not yet discovered that
    intense concentration on herself and her family with which,
    after their quarrel, Mrs. Thrale, not quite an impartial judge,
    but a very shrewd one, charged her, and which does appear in the

But there is more to be said for Mrs. Radcliffe than this. Her "explained supernatural," tiresome
as it may be to some of us nowadays, is really a marvel of patience and ingenuity: and this
same quality extends to her plots generally. The historical side of her novels (which she does
to some extent attempt) is a failure, as everything of the kind was before Scott: that we may
leave till we come to Scott himself. But one important engine of the novelist she set to work
in a fashion which had never been managed before, and that is elaborate description. She shows
an early adaptation of that "picturesque," of which we see the beginnings in Gray, when she
was in the nursery, which was being directly developed by Gilpin, but which, as we may see
from her Travels, she had got not merely from books, but from her own observation. She applies
it both within and without: at one moment giving pages on the scenery of the Apennines, at
another paragraphs on the furniture of her abbeys and castles. The pine forests and the cataracts;
the skyline of Udolpho bathed in sunset glow, while a "melancholy purple tint" steals up the
slopes to its foundations--are all in the day's work now; but they were not so then, and it
is fair to say that Mrs. Radcliffe does them well. The "high canopied tester of dark green
damask" and the "counterpane of black velvet" which illustrate the introduction of the famous
chapter of the Black Pall in Chateau le Blanc may be mere inventory goods now: but, once more,
they were not so then. And this faculty of description (which, as noted above, could hardly
have been, and pretty certainly was not, got from books, though it may have been, to some extent
and quite legitimately, got from pictures) was applied in many minor ways--touches of really
or supposedly horrible objects in the dark, faint suggestions of sound, or of appeals to the
other senses--hints of all sorts, which were to become common tricks of the trade, but were
then quite new.

At any rate, by these and other means she attained that great result of the novel which has
been noted in Defoe, in Richardson, and in others--the result of what the French vividly call
enfisting the reader--getting hold of his attention, absorbing him in a pleasant fashion. The
mechanism was often too mechanical: taken with the author's steady and honest, but somewhat
inartistic determination to explain everything it sometimes produces effects positively ridiculous
to us. With the proviso of valeat quantum, it is not quite unfair to dwell, as has often been
dwelt, on the fact that the grand triumph of Mrs. Radcliffe's terrormongering--the famous incident
of the Black Veil--is produced by a piece of wax-work. But the result resulted--the effect
was produced: and it was left to those who were clever enough to improve upon the means. For
the time these means were "improved upon" in another sense; we shall glance at some of the
caricatures, intended and unintended, later. For the present we may turn to other varieties
of the curiously swarming novel-production of these two last decades of the century, and especially
of the very last.

If Scott had not established Richard Cumberland's Henry (1795) in the fortress of the Ballantyne
Novels, it would hardly be necessary to notice "Sir Fretful Plagiary's" contributions to the
subject of our history. He preluded it with another, Arundel (1789), and followed it much later
with a third, John de Lancaster: but there is no need to say anything of these. Henry displays
the odd hit-and-miss quality which seems to have attached itself to Cumberland everywhere,
whether as novelist, dramatist, essayist, diplomatist, poet, or anything else. It is, though
by no means a mere "plagiarism," an obvious and avowed imitation of Fielding, and the writer
is so intent on his pastiche that he seems quite oblivious himself, and appears to expect equal
oblivion on the part of his readers, of the fact that nearly two generations had passed. Henry
is Joseph; Susan May is a much more elaborate and attractive Betty; the doctor's wife a vulgarised
and repulsive Lady Booby; Ezekiel Daw, whom Scott admired, a dissenting Adams--the full force
of the outrage of which variation Sir Walter perhaps did not feel. There are some good things
in the story, but, as a whole, it is chiefly valuable as an early example of that great danger
of modern literature--the influence of the "printed book" itself: and in a less degree of that
forging ahead of the novel generally in public favour which we are chronicling. If the kind
had not been popular, and if Fielding had not been its great prophet, one may be pretty sure
that Henry would never have existed. The causes are important: the effect not quite so.

There was, however, at this time a novel-school, and not such a very small one, which had more
legitimate reasons for existence, inasmuch as it really served as mouthpiece to the thoughts
and opinions of the time, whether these thoughts and opinions were good or bad. This may be
called the "revolutionary school," and its three most distinguished scholars were Bage, Holcroft,
and Godwin, with Mrs. Inchbald perhaps to be added. The first began considerably before the
outbreak of the actual French Revolution and shows the influence of its causes: the others
were directly influenced by itself.

One of the most remarkable of English novel-writers who are not absolute successes, and one
who, though less completely obscured by Fortune than some, has never had quite his due, is
Robert Bage. It was unfortunate for him that he fell in with the crude generation contemporary
in their manhood with the French Revolution, and so manifested the crudity in full. Bage, in
fact, except for a certain strength of humour, is almost more French than English. He has been
put in the school of Richardson, but it is certain that Richardson would have been shocked
at the supposed scholar: and it is not certain that Bage would or need have felt complimented
by the assignment of the master. He know up of engineering as it was to my.

 This far-renowned work opens with the exclamation of the heroine Amanda, "Hail, sweet
sojourn of my infancy!" and we are shortly afterwards informed that in the garden "the part
appropriated to vegetables was divided from the part sacred to Flora." Otherwise, the substance
of the thing is a curious sort of watered-down Richardson, passed through successive filtering
beds of Mackenzie, and even of Mrs. Radcliffe. It is difficult for even the most critical taste
to find much savour or stimulus in the resulting liquid. But, like almost everybody mentioned
here, Regina is a document of the demands of readers and the faculty of writers: and so she
"standeth," if not exactly "crowned," yet ticketed.

Work--somewhat later--of some interest, but not of first-class quality, is to be found in the
Discipline (1811) and Self-Control (1814) of Mary Brunton. A Balfour of Orkney on the father's
side and a Ligonier on the mother's, the authoress had access to the best English as well as
Scottish society, and seems to have had more than a chance of taking a place in the former:
but preferred to marry a minister-professor and settled down to country manse life. She died
in middle age and her husband wrote a memoir of her. Discipline seems to represent a sort of
fancy combination of the life she might have led and the life she did lead. Ellen Percy, the
heroine, starts in the highest circles; forgets herself so far as to "waltze" with a noble
ne'er-do-weel, thereby earning the "stern disapprobation" of a respectable lover; comes down
in the world; has Highland experiences which, at the book's early date, are noteworthy; marries
(like her creatress) a minister; but "retains a little of her coquettish sauciness." "Bless
her, poor little dear!" one can imagine Thackeray exclaiming in his later and mellowed days.
Mrs. Brunton's letters breathe a lady-like and not unamiable propriety, and she is altogether
a sort of milder, though actually earlier, Miss Ferrier.

Ireland vindicated its claim to comparative liveliness in the work of a better known contemporary
and survivor. It is written in letters: and the most interesting thing about it for some readers
now is that the heroine supplied Thackeray with the name Glorvina, which, it seems, means in
Irish "sweet voice," if Lady Morgan is to be trusted in rebus Celticis. It is to be hoped she
is: for the novel is a sort of macédoine of Irish history, folk-lore, scenery, and what not,
done up in a syrup of love-making quant. suff. Its author wrote many more novels and became
a butt for both good- and ill-natured satire with the comic writers of the twenties, thirties,
and forties. The title was actually borrowed by Maturin in The Wild Irish "Boy," and it is
fair to say that the book preceded Scott's, though not Miss Edgeworth's, experiments in the
line of the "national" novel. The earlier Reviewers were discreditably savage on women-writers,
and Lady Morgan had her share of their truculence. She did not wholly deserve it: but it must
be said that nothing she wrote can really be ranked as literature, save on the most indiscriminate
and uncritical estimate. It is, however, difficult to see much harm in her.

Ida of Athens, for instance, which shocked contemporaries, and which, by the way, has the very
large first title of Woman, could only bring a blush to cheeks very tickle of that sere: a
yawn might come much more easily. The most shocking thing that the heroine, who is "an attempt
to delineate woman in her natural state," does (and that not of malice) is to receive her lover
in a natural bathroom. But her adventures are told in a style which is the oddest compound
of Romantesque and Johnsonese. ("The hour was ardent. The bath was cool. He calculated upon
the probable necessity of its enjoyment.") The spirit is the silliest and most ignorant Philhellenism--all
the beauty, virtue, wisdom, of the ancient Greeks being supposed to be inherited by their mongrel
successors of the early nineteenth century. An English and a Turkish lover dispute Ida's affection
or possession. There are the elaborate pseudo-erudite notes which one has learnt to associate
chiefly with Moore. The authoress boasts in her preface that she "has already written almost
as many volumes as she has years," and that she has hardly ever corrected her proofs. Perhaps
this silliness will make some think her not more an example of the savagery of contemporary
criticism than a justification thereof.

It was in fact not only brutal man who objected to the preposterous excesses of pseudo-romance:
and serious or jocular parables were taken up against it, if not before Northanger Abbey was
written, long before it was published. In 1810 a certain "G." or "S.G.," whose full name was
Sarah Green, wrote, besides some actual history and an attempt at the historical novel, a very
curious and rather hybrid book entitled Romance Readers and Romance Writers. Its preface is
an instance of "Women, beware Women," for though it stigmatises male creatures, such as a certain
Curteis and a certain Pickersgill, it treats Lady Morgan (then only Sydney Owenson) and "Rosa
Matilda" even more roughly and asks (as has been asked about a hundred years later and was
asked about a hundred years before), "Is it not amazing that the [two] most licentious writers
of romance are women?" And it starts with a burlesque account of a certain Margaret Marsham
who exclaims, "What then? to add to my earthly miseries am I to be called Peggy? My name is
Margaritta!" "I am sure that if I am called Peggy again I shall go into a fit." But this promise
of something to complete the trio with Northanger Abbey and The Heroine (to be presently mentioned)
is not maintained. Not only does the writer force the note of parody too much by making "Margaritta"
say to herself, "Poor persecuted dove that I am," and adore a labourer's shirt on a hedge,
but she commits the far more fatal fault of exchanging her jest for earnest. Margaritta--following
her romance-models--falls a victim to an unprincipled great lady and the usual wicked baronet--at
whose head, one is bound to say, she flings herself with such violence as no baronet could
possibly resist. Her sister Mary, innocent of romance-reading and all other faults, is, though
not as guilty, as unlucky almost as Margaret: and by far the greater part of the book is an
unreal presentment, in nearly the worst manner of the eighteenth century itself, of virtuous
curates, unvirtuous "tonish" rectors, who calmly propose to seduce their curates' daughters
(an offence which, for obvious reasons, must, in the worst times, have been unusual), libertine
ladies, and reckless "fashionables" of all kinds. The preface and the opening create expectations,
not merely of amusement but of power, which are by no means fulfilled. It is "S.G." who asserts
that Ida of Athens "has brought a blush to the cheek of many," and one can only repeat the
suggested substitution.

 Smollett, like Defoe, was not much more than part of a novelist: and Miss
Burney lacked strength, equality, and range. There remained Fielding: and it certainly is not
here that any restrictions or allowances will be insinuated as to Fielding's praise. But Fielding's
novels are a circle in which no one else save Thackeray has ever been able to walk. And what
we are looking for now is something rather different from this--a masterpiece, or masterpieces,
which may not only yield delight and excite admiration in itself or themselves, but may bring
forth fruit in others--fruit less masterly perhaps, but of the same or a similar kind. In other
words, nobody's work yet--save in the special kinds--had been capable of yielding a novel-formula:
nobody had hit upon the most capital and fruitful novel-ideas. And nearly everybody had, in
the kind, done work curiously and almost incomprehensibly faulty. Of these faults, the worst,
perhaps, were classable under the general head of inverisimilitude. Want of truth to nature
in character and dialogue, extravagant and clumsy plotting, neglect of (indeed entire blindness
to) historic colour, unreal and unobserved description--all these things might be raised to
a height or sunk to a bathos in the work of the Minerva Press--but there was far too much of
them in all the novel work of these sixty or seventy years.

Although the facts and dates are well enough known, it is perhaps not always remembered that
Miss Austen, while representing what may, using a rather objectionable and ambiguous word,
be called a more "modern" style of novel than Scott's, began long before him and had almost
finished her work before his really began. If that wonderful Bath bookseller had not kept Northanger
Abbey in a drawer, instead of publishing it, it would have had nearly twenty years start of
Waverley. And it must be remembered that Northanger Abbey, though it is, perhaps, chiefly thought
of as a parody-satire on the school of Mrs. Radcliffe, is, as these parody-satires have a habit
of being, a great deal more. If Catherine had not made a fool of herself about the Orphan of
the Black Forest and Horrid Mysteries (or rather if everything relating to this were "blacked
out" as by a Russian censor) there would still remain the admirable framework of her presentation
at Bath and her intercourse with the Tilneys; the more admirable character-sketches of herself--the
triumph of the ordinary made not ordinary--and the Thorpes; the most admirable flashes of satire
and knowledge of human nature, not "promiscuous" or thrown out apropos of things in general,
but acting as assistants and invigorators to the story.

In the few words just used lies, as far as it can be comprehended in any few words, the secret
both of Miss Austen and of Scott. It has been said--more than once or twice, I fear--that hardly
until Bunyan and Defoe do we get an interesting story--something that grasps us and carries
us away with it--at all. Except in the great eighteenth-century Four the experience is not
repeated, save in parts of Miss Burney and Miss Edgeworth later--it is simulated rather than
actually brought about by the Terror-novel--except in the eternal exception of Vathek--for
Maturin did not do his best work till much later. The absence of it is mainly due to a concatenation
of inabilities on the part of the writers. They don't know what they ought to do: and in a
certain sense it may even be said that they don't know what they are doing. In the worst examples
surveyed in the last chapter, such as A Peep at Our Ancestors, this ignorance plumbs the abyss--blocks
of dull serious narrative, almost or quite without action, and occasional insertions of flat,
insipid, and (to any one with a little knowledge) impossible conversation, forming their staple.
Of the better class of books, from the Female Quixote to Discipline, this cannot fairly be
said: but there is always something wanting. Frequently, as in both the books just mentioned,
the writer is too serious and too desirous to instruct. Hardly ever is there a real projection
of character, in the round and living--only pale, sketchy "academies" that neither live, nor
move, nor have any but a fitful and partial being. The conversation is, perhaps, the worst
feature of all--for it follows the contemporary stage in adopting a conventional lingo which,
as we know from private letters as early as Gray's and Walpole's, if not even as Chesterfield's
and those of men and women older still, was not the language of well-bred, well-educated, and
intelligent persons at any time during the century. As for the Fourth Estate of the novel--description--it
had rarely been attempted even by the great masters. In fact it has been pointed out as perhaps
the one unquestionable merit of Mrs. Radcliffe that--following the taste for the picturesque
which, starting from Gray and popularised by Gilpin, was spreading over the country--she did
attempt to introduce this important feature, and did partly, in a rococo way, succeed in introducing
it. As for plot, that has never been our strong point--we seem to have been contented with
Tom Jones as payment in full of that demand.[17]

    [17] The frankness of the ingenious creator of Mr. Jorrocks
    should be imitated by 99 per cent. of English novelists. "The
    following story," says he of Ask Mamma, "does not involve the
    complication of a plot. It is a mere continuous narrative."

Now, this was all changed. It is doubtful whether if Northanger Abbey had actually appeared
in 1796 it would have been appreciated--Miss Austen, like other writers of genius, had, not
exactly as the common but incorrect phrase goes, to create the taste for her own work, but
to arouse the long dormant appetite which she was born to satisfy. Yet, looking back a hundred
years, it seems impossible that anybody of wits should have failed at once to discover the
range, the perfection, and the variety of the new gift, or set of gifts. Here all the elements
come in: and something with them that enlivens and intensifies them all. The plot is not intricate,
but there is a plot--good deal more, perhaps, than is generally noticed, and more than Miss
Austen herself sometimes gave, as, for instance, in Mansfield Park. It is even rather artfully
worked out--the selfish gabble of John Thorpe, who may look to superficial observers like a
mere outsider, playing an important part twice in the evolution. There is not lavish but amply
sufficient description and scenery--the Bath vignettes, especially the Beechencliff prospect;
the sketch of the Abbey itself and of Henry's parsonage, etc. But it is in the other two constituents
that the blowing of the new wind of the spirit is most perceptible. The character-drawing is
simply wonderful, especially in the women--though the men lack nothing. John Thorpe has been
glanced at--there had been nothing like him before, save in Fielding and in the very best of
the essayists and dramatists. General Tilney has been found fault with as unnatural and excessive:
but only by people who do not know what "harbitrary gents" fathers of families, who were not
only squires and members of parliament, but military men, could be in the eighteenth century--and
perhaps a little later. His son Henry, in common with most of his author's jeunes premiers,
has been similarly objected to as colourless. He really has a great deal of subdued individuality,
and it had to be subdued, because it would not have done to let him be too superior to Catherine.
James Morland and Frederick Tilney are not to be counted as more than "walking gentlemen,"
Mr. Allen only as a little more: and they fulfil their law. But Isabella Thorpe is almost better
than her brother, as being nearer to pure comedy and further from farce; Eleanor Tilney is
adequate; and Mrs. Allen is sublime on her scale. A novelist who, at the end of the eighteenth
century, could do Mrs. Allen, could do anything that she chose to do; and might be trusted
never to attempt anything that she could not achieve. And yet the heroine is perhaps--as she
ought to be--the greatest triumph of the whole, and the most indicative of the new method.
The older heroines had generally tried to be extraordinary: and had failed. Catherine tries
to be ordinary: and is an extraordinary success. She is pretty, but not beautiful: sensible
and well-natured, but capable, like most of us, of making a complete fool of herself and of
doing complete injustice to other people; fairly well educated, but not in the least learned
or accomplished. In real life she would be simply a unit in the thousands of quite nice but
ordinary girls whom Providence providentially provides in order that mankind shall not be alone.
In literature she is more precious than rubies--exactly because art has so masterfully followed
and duplicated nature.

Precisely to what extent the attractive quality of this art is enhanced by the pervading irony
of the treatment would be a very difficult problem to work out. It is scarcely hazardous to
say that irony is the very salt of the novel: and that just as you put salt even in a cake,
so it is not wise to neglect it wholly even in a romance. Life itself, as soon as it gets beyond
mere vegetation, is notoriously full of irony: and no imitation of it which dispenses with
the seasoning can be worth much. That Miss Austen's irony is consummate can hardly be said
to be matter of serious contest.

It has sometimes been thought--perhaps mistakenly--that the exhibition of it in Northanger
Abbey is, though a very creditable essay, not consummate. But Pride and Prejudice is known
to be, in part, little if at all later than Northanger Abbey: and there can again be very little
dispute among judges in any way competent as to the quality of the irony there. Nor does it
much matter what part of this wonderful book was written later and what earlier: for its ironical
character is all-pervading, in almost every character, except Jane and her lover who are mere
foils to Elizabeth and Darcy, and even in these to some extent; and in the whole story, even
in the at least permitted suggestion that the sight of Pemberley, and Darcy's altered demeanour,
had something to do with Elizabeth's resignation of the old romantic part of Belle dame sans
merci. It may further be admitted, even by those who protest against the undervaluation of
Northanger Abbey, that Pride and Prejudice flies higher, and maintains its flight triumphantly.
It is not only longer; it is not only quite independent of parody or contrast with something
previous; but it is far more intricate and elaborate as well as more original. Elizabeth herself
is not merely an ordinary girl: and the putting forward of her, as an extraordinary yet in
no single point unnatural one, is victoriously carried out. Her father, in spite of (nay, perhaps,
including) his comparative collapse when he is called upon, not as before to talk but to act,
in the business of Lydia's flight, is a masterpiece. Mr. Collins is, once more by common consent
of the competent, unsurpassed, if not peerless: those who think him unnatural simply do not
know nature. Shakespeare and Fielding were the only predecessors who could properly serve as
sponsors to "this young lady" (as Scott delightfully calls her) on her introduction among the
immortals on the strength of this character alone. Lady Catherine is not much the inferior
(it would have been pleasing to tell her so) of her protégé and chaplain. Of almost all the
characters, and of quite the whole book, it is scarcely extravagant to say that it could not
have been better on its own scale and scheme--that it is difficult to conceive any scheme and
scale on which it could have been better. And, yet once more, there is nothing out of the way
in it--the only thing not of absolutely everyday occurrence, the elopement of Lydia, happens
on so many days still, with slight variations, that it can hardly be called a licence.

The same qualities appear throughout the other books, whether in more or less quintessence
and with less or more alloy is a question rather of individual taste than for general or final
critical decision. All was charming, rearward. Or so read that he want such retentive do that,

"
 The brilliant overture of Waverley as such, with
its entirely novel combination of the historical and the "national" elements upon the still
more novel background of Highland scenery; the equally vivid and vigorous narrative and the
more interesting personages of Old Mortality and Rob Roy; the domestic tragedy, with the historical
element for little more than a framework, of the Heart of Midlothian and the Bride of Lammermoor;
the little masterpiece of A Legend of Montrose; the fresh departure, with purely English subject,
of Ivanhoe and its triumphant sequels in Kenilworth, Quentin Durward, and others; the striking
utilisation of literary assistance in the Fortunes of Nigel; and the wonderful blending of
autobiographic, historical, and romantic interest in Redgauntlet:--one cannot dwell on these
and other things. The magic continued even in Woodstock--written as this was almost between
the blows of the executioner's crow-bar on the wheel, in the tightening of the windlasses at
the rack--it is not absent, whatever people may say, in Anne of Geierstein, nor even quite
lacking in the better parts of Count Robert of Paris. But we must not expatiate on its effects;
we must only give a little attention to the means by which they are achieved.

Another of the common errors about Scott is to represent--perhaps really to regard--him as
a hit-or-miss and hand-to-mouth improvisatore, who bundled out his creations anyhow, and did
not himself know how he created them. The fallacy is worse than a fallacy: for it is down-right
false witness. We have numerous passages in and out of the novels--the chief of them being
the remarkable conversation with Captain Clutterbuck in the Introduction to the Fortunes of
Nigel and the reflections in the Diary on Sir John Chiverton and Brambletye House--showing
that Scott knew perfectly well the construction and the stringing of his fiddle, as well as
the trick of applying his rosin. But if we had not these direct testimonies, no one of any
critical faculty could mistake the presence of consciously perceived principles in the books
themselves. A man does not suddenly, and by mere blind instinct, avoid such a pitfall as that
of incongruous speech and manners, which has been noticed above. It is not mere happy-go-lucky
blundering which makes him invariably decline another into which people still fall--the selection
of historical personages of the first importance, and elaborately known, for the central figures
of his novels. Not to believe in luck is a mark of perhaps greater folly than to over-believe
in it: but luck will not always keep a man clear of such perils as that unskilful wedging of
great blocks of mere history into his story, which the lesser historical novelists always commit,
or that preponderance of mere narrative itself as compared with action and conversation from
which even Dumas, even Thackeray, is not free.

That he knew what he was doing and what he had to do is thus certain; that he did it to an
astounding extent is still more certain; but it would not skill much to deny that he did not
always give himself time to do it perfectly in every respect, though it is perhaps not mere
paradox or mere partisanship to suggest that if he had given himself more time, he would hardly
have done better, and might have done worse. The accusation of superficiality has been already
glanced at: and it is pretty certain that it argues more superficiality, of a much more hopeless
kind, in those who make it. The accusation of careless and slovenly style is not much better:
for Scott had, perfectly, the style suited to his own work, and you cannot easily have a better
style than that. But there are two defects in him which were early detected by good and friendly
judges: and which are in fact natural results of the extraordinary force and fertility of his
creative power. One--the less serious, but certainly to some extent a fault in art and a point
in which he is distinguished for the worse from Shakespeare--is that he is rather given to
allow at first, to some of his personages, an elaborateness and apparent emphasis of drawing
which seems to promise an importance for them in the story that they never actually attain. "which'who
demur promptly?" it shout Mister Love; "you had not be written your opinion?" Same story of
exalted as he see, precursorship; she remain in Life, and would deserve content letters may show
it brought of Bugs and grey; apart to planning in story! really saturated is more aid! "might be
extremely the have been difficult?" they see Cecilia; "however, i abstract it does not wish me brought."
That sentimentality, both, who was thus 1829 faults'charge, she is not pleased as her do

regretful i have been marry her brought, almost be later big to speak

 And perhaps one may end by pronouncing
Bulwer one of the very greatest of English novelists who are not of the very greatest.

It is difficult to say whether the usual attitude of criticism to Captain Marryat (1792-1848)
is more uncritical than ungrateful or more ungrateful than uncritical. Because he has amused
the boy, it seems to be taken for granted that he ought not to amuse the man: because he does
not write with the artificial and often extremely arbitrary graces of the composition books,
that he is "not literature." If it be so, why in the first case so much the worse for "the
man," and in the second so much the worse for literature. As a matter of fact, he has many
of the qualities of the novelist in a high degree: and if he were in the fortunate position
of an ancient classic, whose best works only survive, these qualities could not fail of recognition.
Much of his later work simply ought not to count; for it was mere hack-labour, rendered, if
not necessary, very nearly so by the sailor's habit (which Marryat possessed in the highest
degree) of getting rid of money. Even among this, Masterman Ready and The Children of the New
Forest, "children's books," as they may be called, rank very high in their kind. But he counts
here, of course, for his sea-novels mainly: and in them there are several things for us to
notice. One is that Marryat had the true quality of the craftsman, as distinguished from the
amateur or the chance-medley man who has a lucky inspiration. If it were the case that his
books derived their whole attraction from the novelty and (within its limits) the variety of
their sea-matter, then the first ought to be the best, as in nearly all such cases is the fact.
But Frank Mildmay (1829), so far from being the best, is not far from being the worst of Marryat's
novels. Much--dangerously much--as he put of his own experiences in the book, he did not know
in the least how to manage them. And if Frank is something of a bravo, more of a blackguard,
and nearly a complete ruffian, it is not merely because there was a good deal of brutality
in the old navy; not merely because Marryat's own standard of chivalry was not quite that of
Chaucer's Knight:--but partly, also, because he was aiming blunderingly at what he supposed
to be part of the novelist's business--irregular as well as regular gallantry, and highly seasoned
adventure. But, like all good artists (and like hardly anybody who has not the artistic quality
in him), he taught himself by his failure, even though he sometimes relapsed. Of actual construction
he was never a master. The King's Own, with its overdose of history at the beginning and of
melodrama at the end, is an example. But his two masterpieces, Peter Simple (1834) and Mr.
Midshipman Easy (1836), are capital instances of what may be called "particularist" fiction--the
fiction that derives its special zest from the "colours" of some form of life unfamiliar to
those who have not actually lived it. Even Peter Simple is unduly weighted at the end by the
machinations of Peter's uncle against him and, at intervals during the book, by the proceedings
connected therewith. But Mr. Midshipman Easy is flawless--except for the amiable but surely
excessive sentimentalists who are shocked at the way in which Mr. Easy père quits the greater
stage by mounting the lesser. Than this book there is not a better novel of special "humour"
in literature; as much may be said of the greater part of Peter Simple, of not a little in
Jacob Faithful (a great favourite with Thackeray, who always did justice to Marryat), and Japhet
in Search of a Father, and of something in almost all. Nor were high jinks and special naval
matters by any means Marryat's only province. Laymen may agree with experts in thinking the
clubhauling of the Diomède in Peter Simple, and the two great fights of the Aurora with the
elements and with the Russian frigate in Mr. Midshipman Easy, to be extraordinarily fine things:--vivid,
free from extravagance, striking, stirring, clear, as descriptive and narrative literature
of the kind can be only at its best, and too seldom is at all. An almost Defoe-like exactness
of detail is one of Marryat's methods and merits: while it is very remarkable that he rarely
attempts to produce the fun, in which Defoe is lacking and he himself so fertile, by mere exaggeration
or caricature of detail. There are exceptions--the Dominie business in Jacob Faithful is one--but
they are exceptions. Take Hook, his immediate predecessor, and no doubt in a way his model,
as (it has been said) Hook was to almost everybody at the time; take even Dickens, his fellow-pupil
with Hook and his own greater successor; and you will find that Marryat resorts less than either
to the humour of simple charge or exaggeration.

The last name on our present list belongs to the class of "eccentric" novelists--the adjective
being used, not in its transferred and partly improper sense so much as in its true one. Peacock
never plays the Jack-pudding like Sterne: and his shrewd wit never permits him the sincere
aberrations of Amory. But his work is out of the ordinary courses, and does not turn round
the ordinary centres of novel writing. It belongs to the tradition--if to any tradition at
all--of Lucian and the Lucianists--especially as that tradition was redirected by Anthony Hamilton.
It thus comes, in one way, near part of the work of Disraeli; though, except in point of satiric
temper, its spirit is totally different. Peacock was essentially a scholar (though a non-academic
one) and essentially a humorist. In the progress of his books from Headlong Hall (1816) to
Gryll Grange (1860)--the last separated from the group to which the first belongs by more than
twice as many years as were covered by that group itself--he mellowed his tone, but altered
his scheme very little. Except in Maid Marian and The Misfortunes of Elphin, where the Scott
influence is evident, though Peacock was himself a rebel to Scott, the plan is always the same.
Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey, Melincourt and Crotchet Castle (1831), as well as Gryll
Grange itself, all have the uniform, though by no means monotonous, canvas of a party of guests
assembled at a country-house and consisting of a number of "originals," with one or more common-sense
but by no means commonplace characters to serve as contrast. It is in the selection and management
of these foils that one of Peacock's principal distinctions lies. In his earlier books, and
in accordance with the manners of the time, there is a good deal of "high jinks"--less later.
In all, there is also a good deal of personal and literary satire, which tones and mellows
as it proceeds. At first Peacock is extremely unjust to the Lake poets--so unjust indeed as
to be sometimes hardly amusing--to the two universities (of which it so happened that he was
not a member), to the Tory party generally, to clergymen, to other things and persons. In Crotchet
Castle the progress of Reform was already beginning to produce a beneficent effect of reaction
upon him, and in Gryll Grange, though the manners and cast are surprisingly modern, the whole
tone is conservative--with a small if not even with a large C--for the most prominent and well
treated character is a Churchman of the best academic Tory type.

It is not, however, in anything yet mentioned that Peacock's charm consists, so much as in
the intensely literary, but not in the least pedantic, tone with which he suffuses his books,
the piquant but not in the least affected turn of the phrases that meet us throughout, the
peculiar quality of his irony (most quintessenced in The Misfortunes of Elphin, which is different
in scheme from the rest, but omnipresent), and the crisp presentation of individual scene,
incident, and character of a kind. Story, in the general sense, there is none, or next to none--the
personages meet, go through a certain number of dinners (Peacock is great at eating and drinking),
diversions, and difficulties, marry to a greater or less extent, but otherwise part. Yet such
things as the character of Scythrop in Nightmare Abbey (a half fantastic, half faithful portrait
of Shelley, who was Peacock's intimate friend), or of Dr. Folliott (a genial parson) in Crotchet
Castle--as the brilliant picture of the breaking of the dyke in Elphin, or the comic one of
the rotten-borough election in Melincourt--are among the triumphs of the English novel. And
they are present by dozens and scores: while (though it is a little out of our way) there is
no doubt that the attraction of the books is greatly enhanced by the abundance of inset verse--sometimes
serious, more often light--of which Peacock, again in an eccentric fashion, was hardly less
a master than he was of prose.

Here also it has seemed fit to dwell on a single writer, not perhaps generally held to be of
the absolutely first class, because these "eccentrics" are of very great importance in the
history of the English novel. The danger of the kind--even more than of other literary kinds--lies
in the direction of mould and mechanism--of the production, by the thousand, of things of no
individual quality and character. This danger has been and is being amply exemplified. But
the Peacocks (would the plural were more justified!) save us from it by their own unconquerable
individuality in the first place and, in the second, by the fact that even the best in this
kind is "caviare to the general," while anything that is not the best has no attraction either
for the general or the elect. They are, as it were, the salt of the novel-feast, in more senses
than one: and it is cause for thankfulness that, in this respect as in the physical, England
has been well off for salt-pits.

Besides these individual names--which in most literatures would be great, and even in English
literature are not small--the second quarter of the century added to the history of the novel
an infinity of others who can hardly appear here even on the representative or selective system.

There is thus something of similarity (though with attendant differences, of the most important
kind) between the joint position of Dickens and Thackeray towards the world of the novel, and
the joint position of Scott and Miss Austen. They overlap more than their great forerunners
of the preceding generation. Both wrote historical novels: it is indeed Thackeray's unique
distinction that he was equally master of the historical novel and of the novel of pure modern
society, almost uneventful. In parts of some of his later books, especially Little Dorrit,
Great Expectations, and Our Mutual Friend, Dickens at least tried to exchange his picaresque-fantastic
cloudland for actual ordinary modern life. But on the whole the method of Thackeray was the
method of the novel, though shot with a strong romantic spirit, and the method of Dickens the
method of the romance applied, for the most part, to material which could hardly be called
romantic. Both, therefore, in a manner, recalled the forces of fiction from the rather straggling
and particularist courses which it had been pursuing for the last quarter of a century.

In fact, even in the two mighty men of genius whom we have just been discussing, there may
be seen--at their beginnings at least--something of that irresolution, uncertainty, and want
of reliance on the powers of the novel, it-by-itself-it, which we have noticed before: and
which the unerring craftsmanship of Scott had already pointed out in the "Conversation of the
Author of Waverley with Captain Clutterbuck" more than once referred to. They want excuses
and pretexts, bladders and spring-boards. Even Dickens, despite his irrepressible self-reliance,
burdens himself, at the beginning of Pickwick, with the clumsy old machinery of a club which
