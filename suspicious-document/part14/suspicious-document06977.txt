We ultimately obtained a respectable and remunerative situation for Thomas Linden in a mercantile
house at Belfast, with which we were professionally acquainted, and after securing berths in
the Erin steamer, he, with his wife and mother-in-law, came, with a kind of hopeful sadness
in their looks and voices, to bid us farewell--for a very long time, they and we also feared--

For an eternity, it seemed, on reading the account of the loss of the Erin, a few days afterwards,
with every soul on board! Their names were published with those of the other passengers who
had embarked, and we had of course concluded that they had perished, when a letter reached
us from Belfast, stating that, through some delay on the part of Mrs. Arnold, they had happily
lost their passage in the Erin, and embarked in the next steamer for Belfast, where they arrived
in perfect safety. We forwarded this intelligence to Holmford, but it elicited no reply.

We heard nothing of Mr. Linden for about two months, except by occasional notices in the "Hereford
Times", which he regularly forwarded to the office, relative to the improvements on the Holmford
estate, either actually begun or contemplated by its new proprietor. He very suddenly reappeared.
I was cooling my heels in the waiting-room of the chambers of the Barons of the Exchequer,
Chancery Lane, awaiting my turn of admission, when one of our clerks came in, half-breathless
with haste. "You are wanted, sir, immediately; Mr. Flint is out, and Mr. Linden is at the office
raving like a mad-man." I instantly transferred the business I was in attendance at chambers
upon, to the clerk, and with the help of a cab soon reached home.

Mr. Linden was not raving when I arrived. The violence of the paroxysm of rage and terror by
which he was possessed had passed away, and he looked, as I entered, the image of pale, rigid,
iron, dumb despair. He held a letter and a strip of parchment in his hand; these he presented,
and with white, stammering lips, bade me read. The letter was from an attorney of the name
of Sawbridge, giving notice of an action of ejectment, to oust him from the possession of the
Holmford estate, the property, according to Mr. Sawbridge, of one Edwin Majoribanks; and the
strip of parchment was the writ by which the letter had been quickly followed. I was astounded;
and my scared looks questioned Mr. Linden for further information.

"I do not quite understand it," he said in a hoarse, palpitating voice. "No possession or title
in the venders; a niece not of age--executors no power to sell--Palliser discovered it, robbed
me, absconded, and I, oh God! am a miserable beggar!"

The last words were uttered with a convulsive scream, and after a few frightful struggles he
fell down in a fit. I had him conveyed to bed, and as soon as he was somewhat recovered, I
hastened off to ascertain from Sawbridge, whom I knew very intimately, the nature of the claim
intended to be set up for the plaintiff, Edwin Majoribanks.

I met Sawbridge just as he was leaving his office, and as he was in too great a hurry to turn
back, I walked along with him, and he rapidly detailed the chief facts about to be embodied
in the plaintiff's declaration. Archibald Dursley, once a London merchant, and who died a bachelor,
had bequeathed his estate, real and personal, to his brother Charles, and a niece, his sister's
child--two-thirds to the niece, and one-third to the brother. The Holmford property, the will
directed, should be sold by public auction when the niece came of age, unless she, by marriage
or otherwise, was enabled, within six months after attaining her majority, to pay over to Charles
Dursley his third in money, according to a valuation made for the purpose by competent assessors.
The brother, Charles Dursley, had urged upon the executors to anticipate the time directed
by the will for the sale of the property; and having persuaded the niece to give a written
authorization for the immediate sale, the executors, chiefly, Sawbridge supposed, prompted
by their own necessities, sold the estate accordingly. But the niece not being of age when
she signed the authority to sell, her consent was of no legal value; and she having since died
intestate, Edwin Majoribanks, her cousin and undoubted heir-at-law--for the property could
not have passed from her, even by marriage--now claimed the estate. Charles Dursley, the brother,
was dead; "and," continued Mr. Sawbridge, "the worst of it is, Linden will never get a farthing
of his purchase-money from the venders, for they are bankrupt, nor from Palliser, who has made
permanent arrangements for continuing abroad, out of harm's reach. It is just as I tell you,"
he added, as we shook hands at parting; "but you will of course see the will, and satisfy yourself.
Good-by."

Here was a precious result of amateur common-sense lawyership! Linden could only have examined
the abstract of title furnished him by Palliser's attorney, and not the right of Dursley's
executors to sell; or had not been aware that the niece could not during her minority, subscribe
an effective legal consent.

I found Mr. Flint at the office, and quickly imparted the astounding news. He was as much taken
aback as myself.

"The obstinate, pig-headed old ass!" he exclaimed; "it almost serves him right, if only for
his Tom-fool nonsense of 'Every man his own lawyer.' What did you say was the niece's name?"

"Well, I don't remember that Sawbridge told me--he was in such a hurry; but suppose you go
at once and look over the will?"

"True: I will do so;" and away he went.

"This is a very singular affair, Sharp," said Mr. Flint on his return from Doctors' Commons,
at the same time composedly seating himself, hooking his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat,
crossing his legs, and tilting his chair back on its hind legs. "A very singular affair. Whom,
in the name of the god of thieves--Mercury, wasn't he called?--do you suppose the bankrupt
executors to be? No other," continued Mr. Flint with a sudden burst, "than Crowther & Jenkins!"

"The devil!--and the niece then is"--

"Catherine Arnold--Tom Linden's wife--supposed to have been drowned in the Erin! That's check-mate,
I rather fancy--not only to Mr. Edwin Majoribanks, but some one else we know of. The old fellow
up stairs won't refuse to acknowledge his daughter-in-law now, I fancy!"

This was indeed a happy change in the fortunes of the House of Linden; and we discussed, with
much alacrity, the best mode of turning disclosures so momentous and surprising to the best
account. As a first step, a letter with an inclosure, was dispatched to Belfast, requiring
the return of Thomas Linden and family immediately; and the next was to plead in form to the
action. This done, we awaited Catherine Linden's arrival in London, and Mr. Linden senior's
convalescence--for his mental agitation had resulted in a sharp fit of illness--to effect a
satisfactory and just arrangement.

Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Linden and Mrs. Arnold arrived by the earliest steamer that left Belfast
after the receipt of our letter; and much astonished were they by the intelligence that awaited
them. Catherine Linden was for confirming the validity of the sale of the Holmford estate by
her now authoritative consent at once, as a mere act of common justice and good faith; but
this, looking at the total loss of fortune she had sustained by the knavery of the executors,
and the obstinate, mulish temper of the father-in-law, from whom she had already received such
harsh treatment, could not for a moment be permitted; and it was finally resolved to take advantage
of the legal position in which she stood, to enforce a due present provision for herself and
husband, and their ultimate succession to the estate.

John Linden gradually recovered; and as soon as it was deemed prudent to do so, we informed
him that the niece was not dead, as the plaintiff in the action of ejectment had supposed,
and that of course, if she could now be persuaded to ratify the imperative consent she had
formerly subscribed, he might retain Holmford. At first he received the intelligence as a gleam
of light and hope, but he soon relapsed into doubt and gloom. "What chance was there," he hopelessly
argued, "that, holding the legal power, she would not exercise it?" It was not, he said, in
human nature to do otherwise; and he commissioned us to make liberal offers for a compromise.
Half--he would be content to lose half his purchase-money; even a greater sacrifice than that
he would agree to--anything, indeed, that would not be utter ruin--that did not involve utter
beggary and destitution in old age.

Three days after this conversation, I announced to him that the lady and her husband were below
and desirous of seeing him.

"What do they say?" he eagerly demanded. "Will they accept of half--two-thirds? What do they say?"

"I cannot precisely tell you. They wish to see you alone, and you can urge your own views and
offers." He trembled violently, and shrank nervously back as I placed my hand on the door-handle
of the private office. He presently recovered in some degree his self-possession, passed in,
and I withdrew from the humiliating, but salutary spectacle, of obdurate tyrant-power compelled
to humble itself before those whom it had previously scorned and trampled upon.

The legal arrangements which Flint and I had suggested were effected, and Linden, senior, accompanied
by his son, daughter-in-law, and Mrs. Arnold, set off in restored amity for Holmford House.
Edwin Majoribanks abandoned his action, and Palliser, finding that matters were satisfactorily
arranged, retired to England. We afterwards knew that he had discovered the defect of title,
on applying to a well-known conveyancer, to raise a considerable sum by way of mortgage, and
that his first step was to threaten legal proceedings against Crowther & Jenkins for the recovery
of his money; but a hint he obtained of the futility of proceedings against them, determined
him to offer the estate at a low figure to Linden, relying upon that gentleman's ostentatious
contempt of lawyers that the blot in the title, subjected only to his own common-sense spectacles,
would not be perceived.

THE CHEST OF DRAWERS.

I am about to relate a rather curious piece of domestic history, some of the incidents of which,
revealed at the time of their occurrence in contemporary law reports, may be in the remembrance
of many readers. It took place in one of the midland counties, and at a place which I shall
call Watley; the names of the chief actors who figured in it must also, to spare their modesty
of their blushes, as the case may be, be changed; and should one of those persons, spite of
these precautions, apprehend unpleasant recognition, he will be able to console himself with
the reflection, that all I state beyond that which may be gathered from the records of the
law courts will be generally ascribed to the fancy or invention of the writer. And it is as
well, perhaps, that it should be so.

Caleb Jennings, a shoemaker, cobler, snob--using the last word in its genuine classical sense,
and by no means according to the modern interpretation by which it is held to signify a genteel
sneak or pretender--he was anything but that--occupied, some twelve or thirteen years ago,
a stall at Watley, which, according to the traditions of the place, had been hereditary in
his family for several generations. He may also be said to have flourished there, after the
manner of cobblers; for this, it must be remembered, was in the good old times, before the
gutta-percha revolution had carried ruin and dismay into the stalls--those of cobblers--which
in considerable numbers existed throughout the kingdom. Like all his fraternity whom I have
ever fallen in with or heard of, Caleb was a sturdy radical of the Major Cartwright and Henry
Hunt school; and being withal industrious, tolerably skillful, not inordinately prone to the
observance of Saint Mondays, possessed, moreover, of a neatly-furnished sleeping and eating
apartment in the house of which the projecting first floor, supported on stone pillars, over-shadowed
his humble work-place, he vaunted himself to be as really rich as an estated squire, and far
more independent.

There was some truth in this boast, as the case which procured us the honor of Mr. Jennings's
acquaintance sufficiently proved. We were employed to bring an action against a wealthy gentleman
of the vicinity of Watley for a brutal and unprovoked assault he had committed, when in a state
of partial inebriety, upon a respectable London tradesman who had visited the place on business.
On the day of trial our witnesses appeared to have become suddenly afflicted with an almost
total loss of memory; and we were only saved from an adverse verdict by the plain, straight-forward
evidence of Caleb, upon whose sturdy nature the various arts which soften or neutralize hostile
evidence had been tried in vain. Mr. Flint, who personally superintended the case, took quite
a liking to the man; and it thus happened that we were called upon sometime afterwards to aid
the said Caleb in extricating himself from the extraordinary and perplexing difficulty in which
he suddenly and unwittingly found himself involved.

The projecting first floor of the house beneath which the humble work-shop of Caleb Jennings
modestly disclosed itself, had been occupied for many years by an ailing and somewhat aged
gentleman of the name of Lisle. This Mr. Ambrose Lisle was a native of Watley, and had been
a prosperous merchant of the city of London. Since his return, after about twenty years' absence,
he had shut himself up in almost total seclusion, nourishing a cynical bitterness and acrimony
of temper which gradually withered up the sources of health and life, till at length it became
as visible to himself as it had for sometime been to others, that the oil of existence was
expended, burnt up, and that but a few weak flickers more, and the ailing man's plaints and
griefs would be hushed in the dark silence of the grave.

Mr. Lisle had no relatives at Watley, and the only individual with whom he was on terms of
personal intimacy, was Mr. Peter Sowerby, an attorney of the place, who had for many years
transacted all his business. This man visited Mr. Lisle most evenings, played at chess with
him, and gradually acquired an influence over his client which that weak gentleman had once
or twice feebly, but vainly endeavored to shake off. To this clever attorney, it was rumored,
Mr. Lisle had bequeathed all his wealth.

This piece of information had been put in circulation by Caleb Jennings, who was a sort of
humble favorite of Mr. Lisle's, or, at all events, was regarded by the misanthrope with less
dislike than he manifested towards others. Caleb cultivated a few flowers in a little plot
of ground at the back of the house, and Mr. Lisle would sometimes accept a rose or a bunch
of violets from him. Other slight services--especially since the recent death of his old and
garrulous woman-servant, Esther May, who had accompanied him from London, and with whom Mr.
Jennings had always been upon terms of gossiping intimacy--had led to certain familiarities
of intercourse; and it thus happened that the inquisitive shoemaker became partially acquainted
with the history of the wrongs and griefs which preyed upon, and shortened the life of the
prematurely-aged man.

The substance of this every-day, common-place story, as related to us by Jennings, and subsequently
enlarged and colored from other sources, may be very briefly told.

Ambrose Lisle, in consequence of an accident which occurred in his infancy, was slightly deformed.
His right shoulder--as I understood, for I never saw him--grew out, giving an ungraceful and
somewhat comical twist to his figure, which, in female eyes--youthful ones at least--sadly
marred the effect of his intelligent and handsome countenance. This personal defect rendered
him shy and awkward in the presence of women of his own class of society; and he had attained
the ripe age of thirty-seven years, and was a rich and prosperous man, before he gave the slightest
token of an inclination towards matrimony. About a twelvemonth previous to that period of his
life, the deaths--quickly following each other--of a Mr. and Mrs. Stevens, threw their eldest
daughter, Lucy, upon Mr. Lisle's hands. Mr. Lisle had been left an orphan at a very early age,
and Mrs. Stevens--his aunt, and then a maiden lady--had, in accordance with his father's will,
taken charge of himself and brother till they severally attained their majority. Long, however,
before that, she married Mr. Stevens, by whom she had two children--Lucy and Emily. Her husband,
whom she survived but two months, died insolvent; and in obedience to the dying wishes of his
aunt, for whom he appears to have felt the tenderest esteem, he took the eldest of her orphan
children to his home, intending to regard and provide for her as his own adopted child and
heiress. Emily, the other sister, found refuge in the house of a still more distant relative
than himself.

The Stevenses had gone to live in a remote part of England--Yorkshire, I believe--and it thus
fell out, that, till his cousin Lucy arrived at her new home, he had not seen her for more
than ten years. The pale, and somewhat plain child, as he had esteemed her, he was startled
to find had become a charming woman; and her naturally gay and joyous temperament, quick talents,
and fresh young beauty, rapidly acquired an overwhelming influence over him. Strenuously, but
vainly, he struggled against the growing infatuation--argued, reasoned with himself--passed
in review the insurmountable objections to such a union, the difference of age--he, leading
towards thirty-seven, she, barely twenty-one: he, crooked, deformed, of reserved, taciturn
temper--she, full of young life, and grace, and beauty. It was useless; and nearly a year had
passed in the bootless struggle, when Lucy Stevens, who had vainly striven to blind herself
to the nature of the emotions by which her cousin and guardian was animated towards her, intimated
a wish to accept her sister Emily's invitation to pass two or three months with her. This brought
the affair to a crisis. Buoying himself up with the illusions which people in such an unreasonable
frame of mind create for themselves, he suddenly entered the sitting-room set apart for her
private use, with the desperate purpose of making his beautiful cousin a formal offer of his
hand. She was not in the apartment, but her opened writing-desk, and a partly-finished letter
lying on it, showed that she had been recently there, and would probably soon return. Mr. Lisle
took two or three agitated turns about the room, one of which brought him close to the writing-desk,
and his glance involuntarily fell upon the unfinished letter. Had a deadly serpent leaped suddenly
at his throat, the shock could not have been greater. At the head of the sheet of paper was
a clever pen-and-ink sketch of Lucy Stevens and himself--he, kneeling to her in a lovelorn,
ludicrous attitude, and she, laughing immoderately at his lachrymose and pitiful aspect and
speech. The letter was addressed to her sister Emily; and the enraged lover saw not only that
his supposed secret was fully known, but that he himself was mocked, laughed at, for his doting
folly. At least this was his interpretation of the words which swam before his eyes. At the
instant Lucy returned, and a torrent of imprecation burst from the furious man, in which wounded
self-love, rageful pride, and long pent-up passion, found utterance in wild and bitter words.
Half an hour afterwards Lucy Stevens had left the merchant's house--for ever, as it proved.
She, indeed, on arriving at her sister's, sent a letter, supplicating forgiveness for the thoughtless,
and, as he deemed it, insulting sketch, intended only for Emily's eye; but he replied merely
by a note written by one of his clerks, informing Miss Stevens that Mr. Lisle declined any
further correspondence with her.

The ire of the angered and vindictive man had, however, begun sensibly to abate, and old thoughts,
memories, duties, suggested partly by the blank which Lucy's absence made in his house, partly
by remembrance of the solemn promise he had made her mother, were strongly reviving in his
mind, when he read the announcement of marriage in a provincial journal, directed to him, as
he believed, in the bride's hand-writing; but this was an error, her sister having sent the
newspaper. Mr. Lisle also construed this into a deliberate mockery and insult, and from that
hour strove to banish all images and thoughts connected with his cousin, from his heart and memory.

He unfortunately adopted the very worst course possible for effecting this object. Had he remained
amid the buzz and tumult of active life, a mere sentimental disappointment, such as thousands
of us have sustained and afterwards forgotten, would, there can be little doubt, have soon
ceased to afflict him. He chose to retire from business, visited Watley, and habits of miserliness
growing rapidly upon his cankered mind, never afterwards removed from the lodgings he had hired
on first arriving there. Thus madly hugging to himself sharp-pointed memories, which a sensible
man would have speedily cast off and forgotten, the sour misanthrope passed a useless, cheerless,
weary existence, to which death must have been a welcome relief.

Matters were in this state with the morose and aged man--aged mentally and corporeally, although
his years were but fifty-eight--when Mr. Flint made Mr. Jennings's acquaintance. Another month
or so had passed away when Caleb's attention was one day about noon claimed by a young man
dressed in mourning, accompanied by a female similarly attired, and from their resemblance
to each other he conjectured were brother and sister. The stranger wished to know if that was
the house in which Mr. Ambrose Lisle resided. Jennings said it was; and with civil alacrity
left his stall and rang the front-door bell. The summons was answered by the landlady's servant,
who, since Esther May's death, had waited on the first-floor lodger; and the visitors were
invited to go up stairs. Caleb, much wondering who they might be, returned to his stall, and
from thence passed into his eating and sleeping-room just below Mr. Lisle's apartments. He
was in the act of taking a pipe from the mantel-shelf, in order to the more deliberate and
satisfactory cogitation on such an unusual event, when he was startled by a loud shout, or
scream rather, from above. The quivering and excited voice was that of Mr. Lisle, and the outcry
was immediately followed by an explosion of unintelligible exclamations from several persons.
Caleb was up stairs in an instant, and found himself in the midst of a strangely-perplexing
and distracted scene. Mr. Lisle, pale as his shirt, shaking in every limb, and his eyes on
fire with passion, was hurling forth a torrent of vituperation and reproach at the young woman,
whom he evidently mistook for some one else; whilst she, extremely terrified, and unable to
stand but for the assistance of her companion, was tendering a letter in her outstretched hand,
and uttering broken sentences, which her own agitation and the fury of Mr. Lisle's invectives
rendered totally incomprehensible. At last the fierce old man struck the letter from her hand,
and with frantic rage ordered both the strangers to leave the room. Caleb urged them to comply,
and accompanied them down stairs. When they reached the street, he observed a woman on the
other side of the way, dressed in mourning, and much older apparently, though he could not
well see her face through the thick veil she wore, than she who had thrown Mr. Lisle into such
an agony of rage, apparently waiting for them. To her the young people immediately hastened,
and after a brief conference the three turned away up the street, and Mr. Jennings saw no more
of them.

A quarter of an hour afterwards the house-servant informed Caleb that Mr. Lisle had retired
to bed, and although still in great agitation, and, as she feared, seriously indisposed, would
not permit Dr. Clarke to be sent for. So sudden and violent a hurricane in the usually dull
and drowsy atmosphere in which Jennings lived, excited and disturbed him greatly; the hours,
however, flew past without bringing any relief to his curiosity, and evening was falling, when
a peculiar knocking on the floor over-head announced that Mr. Lisle desired his presence. That
gentleman was sitting up in bed, and in the growing darkness his face could not be very distinctly
seen; but Caleb instantly observed a vivid and unusual light in the old man's eyes. The letter
so strangely delivered was lying open before him; and unless the shoe-mender was greatly mistaken,
there were stains of recent tears upon Mr. Lisie's furrowed and hollow cheeks. The voice, too,
it struck Caleb, though eager, was gentle and wavering. "It was a mistake, Jennings," he said;
"I was mad for the moment. Are they gone?" he added in a yet more subdued and gentle tone.
Caleb informed him of what he had seen; and as he did so, the strange light in the old man's
eyes seemed to quiver and sparkle with a yet intenser emotion than before. Presently he shaded
them with his hand, and remained several minutes silent. He then said with a firmer voice,
"I shall be glad if you will step to Mr. Sowerby, and tell him I am too unwell to see him this
evening. But be sure to say nothing else," he eagerly added, as Caleb turned away in compliance
with his request; "and when you come back, let me see you again."

When Jennings returned, he found to his great surprise Mr. Lisle up and nearly dressed; and
his astonishment increased a hundred-fold upon hearing that gentleman say, in a quick but perfectly
collected and decided manner, that he should set off for London by the mail-train.

"For London--and by night!" exclaimed Caleb, scarcely sure that he heard aright.

"Yes--yes! I shall not be observed in the dark," sharply rejoined Mr. Lisle; "and you, Caleb,
must keep my secret from every body, especially from Sowerby. I shall be here in time to see
him to-morrow night, and he will be none the wiser." This was said with a slight chuckle; and
as soon as his simple preparations were complete, Mr. Lisle, well wrapped up, and his face
almost hidden by shawls, locked his door, and assisted by Jennings, stole furtively down stairs,
and reached unrecognized the railway station just in time for the train.

It was quite dark the next evening when Mr. Lisle returned; and so well had he managed, that
Mr. Sowerby, who paid his usual visit about half an hour afterwards, had evidently heard nothing
of the suspicious absence of his esteemed client from Watley. The old man exulted over the
success of his deception to Caleb, the next morning, but dropped no hint as to the object of
his sudden journey.

Three days passed without the occurrence of any incident tending to the enlightenment of Mr.
Jennings upon these mysterious events, which, however, he plainly saw had lamentably shaken
the long-since failing man. On the afternoon of the fourth day, Mr. Lisle walked, or rather
tottered, into Caleb's stall, and seated himself on the only vacant stool it contained. His
manner was confused, and frequently purposeless, and there was an anxious, flurried expression
in his face, which Jennings did not at all like. He remained silent for some time, with the
exception of partially inaudible snatches of comment or questionings, apparently addressed
to himself. At last he said, "I shall take a longer journey to-morrow, Caleb--much longer;
let me see--where did I say? Ah, yes! to Glasgow; to be sure to Glasgow!"

"To Glasgow, and to-morrow!" exclaimed the astounded cobbler.

"No, no--not Glasgow; they have removed," feebly rejoined Mr. Lisle. "But Lucy has written
it down for me. True--true; and to-morrow I shall set out."

The strange expression of Mr. Lisle's face became momentarily more strongly marked, and Jennings,
greatly alarmed, said, "You are ill, Mr. Lisle; let me run for Dr. Clarke."

"No--no," he murmured, at the same time striving to rise from his seat, which he could only
accomplish by Caleb's assistance, and so supported, he staggered indoors. "I shall be better
to-morrow," he said faintly, and then slowly added, "To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow!
Ah, me! Yes, as I said, to-morrow, I"--He paused abruptly, and they gained his apartment. He
seated himself, and then Jennings, at his mute solicitation, assisted him to bed.

He lay some time with his eyes closed; and Caleb could feel--for Mr. Lisle held him firmly
by the hand, as if to prevent his going away--a convulsive shudder pass over his frame. At
last he slowly opened his eyes, and Caleb saw that he was indeed about to depart upon the long
journey from which there is no return. The lips of the dying man worked inarticulately for
some moments; and then with a mighty effort, as it seemed, he said, whilst his trembling hand
pointed feebly to a bureau chest of drawers that stood in the room, "There--there, for Lucy;
there, the secret place is"--Some inaudible words followed, and then after a still mightier
struggle than before, he gasped out, "No word--no word--to--to Sowerby--for her--Lucy."

More was said, but undistinguishable by mortal ear; and after gazing with an expression of
indescribable anxiety in the scared face of his awe-struck listener, the wearied eyes slowly
reclosed--the deep silence flowed past; then the convulsive shudder came again, and he was dead!

Caleb Jennings tremblingly summoned the house-servant and the landlady, and was still confusedly
pondering the broken sentences uttered by the dying man, when Mr. Sowerby hurriedly arrived.
The attorney's first care was to assume the direction of affairs, and to place seals upon every
article containing or likely to contain anything of value belonging to the deceased. This done,
he went away to give directions for the funeral, which took place a few days afterwards; and
it was then formally announced that Mr. Sowerby succeeded by will to the large property of
Ambrose Lisle; under trust, however, for the family, if any, of Robert Lisle, the deceased's
brother, who had gone when very young to India, and had not been heard of for many years--a
condition which did not at all mar the joy of the crafty lawyer, he having long since instituted
private inquiries, which perfectly satisfied him, that the said Robert Lisle had died, unmarried,
at Calcutta.

Mr. Jennings was in a state of great dubiety and consternation. Sowerby had emptied the chest
of drawers of every valuable it contained; and unless he had missed the secret receptacle Mr.
Lisle had spoken of, the deceased's intentions, whatever they might have been, were clearly
defeated. And if he had not discovered it, how could he, Jennings, get at the drawers to examine
them? A fortunate chance brought some relief to his perplexities. Ambrose Lisle's furniture
was advertised to be sold by auction, and Caleb resolved to purchase the bureau chest of drawers
at almost any price, although to do so would oblige him to break into his rent-money, then
nearly due. The day of sale came, and, the important lot in its turn was put up. In one of
the drawers there were a number of loose newspapers, and other valueless scraps; and Caleb,
with a sly grin, asked the auctioneer, if he sold the article with all its contents. "Oh, yes,"
said Sowerby, who was watching the sale; "the buyer may have all it contains over his bargain,
and much good may it do him." A laugh followed the attorney's sneering remark, and the biddings
went on. "I want it," observed Caleb "because it just fits a recess like this one in my room
underneath." This he said to quiet a suspicion he thought he saw gathering upon the attorney's
brow. It was finally knocked down to Caleb at £5 10s., a sum considerably beyond its real value;
and he had to borrow a sovereign in order to clear his speculative purchase. This done, he
carried off his prize, and as soon as the closing of the house for the night secured him from
interruption, he set eagerly to work in search of the secret drawer. A long and patient examination
was richly rewarded. Behind one of the small drawers of the secrétaire portion of the piece
of furniture was another small one, curiously concealed, which contained Bank-of-England notes
to the amount of £200, tied up with a letter, upon the back of which was written, in the deceased's
hand-writing, "To take with me." The letter which Caleb, although he read print with facility,
had much difficulty in making out, was that which Mr. Lisle had struck from the young woman's
hand a few weeks before, and proved to be a very affecting appeal from Lucy Stevens, now Lucy
Warner, and a widow, with two grown-up children. Her husband had died in insolvent circumstances,
and she and her sister Emily, who was still single, were endeavoring to carry on a school at
Bristol, which promised to be sufficiently prosperous if the sum of about £150 could be raised,
to save the furniture from her deceased husband's creditors. The claim was pressing, for Mr.
Warner had been dead nearly a year, and Mr. Lisle being the only relative Mrs. Warner had in
the world, she had ventured to entreat his assistance for her mother's sake. There could be
no moral doubt, therefore, that this money was intended for Mrs. Warner's relief; and early
in the morning Mr. Caleb Jennings dressed himself in his Sunday's suit, and with a brief announcement
to his landlady that he was about to leave Watley for a day or two, on a visit to a friend,
set off for the railway station. He had not proceeded far when a difficulty struck him--the
bank-notes were all twenties; and were he to change a twenty-pound note at the station, where
he was well known, great would be the tattle and wonderment, if nothing worse, that would ensue.
So Caleb tried his credit again, borrowed sufficient for his journey to London, and there changed
one of the notes.

He soon reached Bristol, and blessed was the relief which the sum of money he brought afforded
Mrs. Warner. She expressed much sorrow for the death of Mr. Lisle, and great gratitude to Caleb.
The worthy man accepted with some reluctance one of the notes, or at least as much as remained
of that which he had changed; and after exchanging promises with the widow and her relatives
to keep the matter secret, departed homewards. The young woman, Mrs. Warner's daughter, who
had brought the letter to Watley, was, Caleb noticed, the very image of her mother, or, rather,
of what her mother must have been when young. This remarkable resemblance it was, no doubt,
which had for the moment so confounded and agitated Mr. Lisle.

Nothing occurred for about a fortnight after Caleb's return to disquiet him, and he had begun
to feel tolerably sure that his discovery of the notes would remain unsuspected, when, one
afternoon, the sudden and impetuous entrance of Mr. Sowerby into his stall caused him to jump
up from his seat with surprise and alarm. The attorney's face was deathly white, his eyes glared
like a wild beast's, and his whole appearance exhibited uncontrollable agitation. "A word with
you, Mr. Jennings," he gasped--"a word in private, and at once!" Caleb, in scarcely less consternation
than his visitor, led the way into his inner room, and closed the door.

"Restore--give back," screamed the attorney, vainly struggling to dissemble the agitation which
convulsed him--"that--that which you have purloined from the chest of drawers!"

The hot blood rushed to Caleb's face and temples; the wild vehemence and suddenness of the
demand confounded him; and certain previous dim suspicions that the law might not only pronounce
what he had done illegal, but possibly felonious, returned upon him with terrible force, and
he quite lost his presence of mind.

"I can't--I can't," he stammered. "It's gone--given away"--

"Gone!" shouted, or, more correctly, howled--Sowerby, at the same time flying at Caleb's throat
as if he would throttle him. "Gone--given away! You lie--you want to drive a bargain with me--dog!--liar!--rascal!--thief!"

This was a species of attack which Jennings was at no loss how to meet. He shook the attorney
roughly off, and hurled him, in the midst of his vituperation, to the further end of the room.

They then stood glaring at each other in silence, till the attorney, mastering himself as well
as he could, essayed another and more rational mode of attaining his purpose:--

"Come, come, Jennings," he said, "don't be a fool. Let us understand each other. I have just
discovered a paper, a memorandum of what you have found in the drawers, and to obtain which
you bought them. I don't care for the money--keep it; only give me the papers--documents."

"Papers--documents!" ejaculated Caleb, in unfeigned surprise.

"Yes--yes; of use to me only. You, I remember, cannot read writing; but they are of great consequence
to me--to me only, I tell you."

"You can't mean Mrs. Warner's letter?"

"No--no; curse the letter! You are playing with a tiger! Keep the money, I tell you; but give
up the papers--documents--or I'll transport you!" shouted Sowerby with reviving fury.

Caleb, thoroughly bewildered, could only mechanically ejaculate that he had no papers or documents.

The rage of the attorney when he found he could extract nothing from Jennings was frightful.
He literally foamed with passion, uttered the wildest threats; and then suddenly changing his
key, offered the astounded cobbler one--two--three thousand pounds--any sum he chose to name,
for the papers--documents! This scene of alternate violence and cajolery lasted nearly an hour;
and then Sowerby rushed from the house as if pursued by the furies, and leaving his auditor
in a state of thorough bewilderment and dismay. It occurred to Caleb, as soon as his mind had
settled into something like order, that there might be another secret drawer; and the recollection
of Mr. Lisle's journey to London recurred suggestively to him. Another long and eager search,
however, proved fruitless; and the suspicion was given up, or, more correctly, weakened.

As soon as it was light the next morning, Mr. Sowerby was again with him. He was more guarded
now, and was at length convinced that Jennings had no paper or document to give up. "It was
only some important memoranda," observed the attorney carelessly, "that would save me a world
of trouble in a lawsuit I shall have to bring against some heavy debtors to Mr. Lisle's estate;
but I must do as well as I can without them. Good morning." Just as he reached the door a sudden
thought appeared to strike him. He stopped and said, "By the way, Jennings, in the hurry of
business I forgot that Mr. Lisle had told me the chest of drawers you bought, and a few other
articles, were family relics which he wished to be given to certain parties he named. The other
things I have got; and you, I suppose, will let me have the drawers for--say a pound profit
on your bargain?"

Caleb was not the acutest man in the world; but this sudden proposition, carelessly as it was
made, suggested curious thoughts. "No," he answered; "I shall not part with it. I shall keep
it as a memorial of Mr. Lisle."

Sowerby's face assumed as Caleb spoke, a ferocious expression. "Shall you?" said he. "Then,
be sure, my fine fellow, that you shall also have something to remember me by as long as you live."

He then went away, and a few days afterwards Caleb was served with a writ for the recovery
of the two hundred pounds.

The affair made a great noise in the place; and Caleb's conduct being very generally approved,
a subscription was set on foot to defray the cost of defending the action--one Hayling, a rival
attorney to Sowerby, having asserted that the words used by the proprietor of the chest of
drawers at the sale barred his claim to the money found in them. This wise gentleman was intrusted
with the defence; and strange to say, the jury--a common one--spite of the direction of the
judge returned a verdict for the defendant, upon the ground that Sowerby's jocular or sneering
remark amounted to a serious, valid leave and license to sell two hundred pounds for five pounds
ten shillings!

Sowerby obtained, as a matter of course, a rule for a new trial; and a fresh action was brought.
All at once Hayling refused to go on, alleging deficiency of funds. He told Jennings that in
his opinion it would be better that he should give in to Sowerby's whim, who only wanted the
drawers in order to comply with the testator's wishes. "Besides," remarked Hayling in conclusion,
"he is sure to get the article, you know, when it comes to be sold under a writ of fi fa."
A few days after this conversation it was ascertained that Hayling was to succeed to Sowerby's
business, the latter gentleman being about to retire upon the fortune bequeathed him by Mr. Lisle.

At last Caleb, driven nearly out of his senses, though still doggedly obstinate, by the harassing
perplexities in which he found himself, thought of applying to us.

"A very curious affair, upon my word," remarked Mr. Flint, as soon as Caleb had unburdened
himself of the story of his woes and cares; "and in my opinion by no means explainable by Sowerby's
anxiety to fulfill the testator's wishes. He cannot expect to get two hundred pence out of
you; and Mrs. Warner, you say, is equally unable to pay. Very odd indeed. Perhaps if we could
get time, something might turn up."

With this view Flint looked over the papers Caleb had brought, and found the declaration was
in trover--a manifest error--the notes never admittedly having been in Sowerby's actual possession.
We accordingly demurred to the form of action, and the proceedings were set aside. This, however,
proved of no ultimate benefit. Sowerby persevered, and a fresh action was instituted against
the unhappy shoe-mender. So utterly overcrowed and disconsolate was poor Caleb, that he determined
to give up the drawers which was all Sowerby even now required, and so wash his hands of the
unfortunate business. Previous, however, to this being done, it was determined that another
thorough and scientific examination of the mysterious piece of furniture should be made; and
for this purpose Mr. Flint obtained a workman skilled in the mysteries of secret contrivances,
from the desk and dressing-case establishment in King Street, Holborn, and proceeded with him
to Watley.

The man performed his task with great care and skill; every depth and width was guaged and
measured, in order to ascertain if there were any false bottoms or backs; and the workman finally
pronounced that there was no concealed receptacle in the article.

"I am sure there is," persisted Flint, whom disappointment as usual rendered but the more obstinate;
"and so is Sowerby: and he knows too, that it is so cunningly contrived as to be undiscoverable,
except by a person in the secret, which he no doubt at first imagined Caleb to be. I'll tell
you what we'll do--You have the necessary tools with you. Split the confounded chest of drawers
into shreds--I'll be answerable for the consequences."

This was done carefully and methodically, but for some time without result. At length the large
drawer next the floor had to be knocked to pieces; and as it fell apart, one section of the
bottom, which, like all the others, was divided into two compartments, dropped asunder, and
discovered a parchment laid flat between the two thin leaves, which, when pressed together
in the grooves of the drawer, presented precisely the same appearance as the rest. Flint snatched
up the parchment, and his eager eye had scarcely rested an instant on the writing, when a shout
of triumph burst from him. It was the last will and testament of Ambrose Lisle, dated August
21, 1838--the day of his last hurried visit to London. It revoked the former will, and bequeathed
the whole of his property, in equal portions, to his cousins Lucy Warner and Emily Stevens,
with succession to their children; but with reservation of one-half to his brother Robert or
children, should he be alive, or have left offspring.

Great, it may be supposed was the jubilation of Caleb Jennings at this discovery; and all Watley,
by his agency, was in a marvelously short space of time in a very similar state of excitement.
It was very late that night when he reached his bed; and how he got there at all, and what
precisely had happened, except, indeed, that he had somewhere picked up a splitting headache,
was, for some time after he awoke the next morning, very confusedly remembered.

Mr. Flint, by reflection, was by no means so exultant as the worthy shoe-mender. The odd mode
of packing away a deed of such importance, with no assignable motive for doing so, except the
needless awe with which Sowerby was said to have inspired his feeble-spirited client, together
with what Caleb had said of the shattered state of the deceased's mind after the interview
with Mrs. Warner's daughter, suggested fears that Sowerby might dispute, and perhaps successfully,
the validity of this last will. My excellent partner, however, determined, as was his wont,
to put a bold face on the matter; and first clearly settling in his own mind what he should
and what he should not say, waited upon Mr. Sowerby. The news had preceded him, and he was
at once surprised and delighted to find that the nervous crest-fallen attorney was quite unaware
of the advantages of his position. On condition of not being called to account for the moneys
he had received and expended, about £1200, he destroyed the former will in Mr. Flint's presence,
and gave up, at once, all the deceased's papers. From these we learned that Mr. Lisle had written
a letter to Mrs. Warner, stating what he had done, and where the will would be found, and that
only herself and Jennings would know the secret. Prom infirmity of purpose, or from having
subsequently determined on a personal interview, the letter was not posted; and Sowerby subsequently
discovered it, together with a memorandum of the numbers of the bank-notes found by Caleb in
the secret drawer--the eccentric gentleman appears to have had quite a mania for such hiding-places--of
a writing-desk.

The affair was thus happily terminated; Mrs. Warner, her children, and sister, were enriched,
and Caleb Jennings was set up in a good way of business in his native place, where he still
flourishes. Over the centre of his shop there is a large nondescript sign, surmounted by a
golden boot, which upon a close inspection is found to bear a resemblance to a huge bureau
chest of drawers, all the circumstances connected with which may be heard, for the asking,
and in much fuller detail than I have given, from the lips of the owner of the establishment,
by any lady or gentleman who will take the trouble of a journey to Watley for that purpose.

THE PUZZLE.

Tempus fugit! The space of but a few brief yesterdays seems to have passed since the occurrence
of the following out-of-the-way incidents--out-of-the-way, even in our profession, fertile
as it is in startling experiences; and yet the faithful and unerring tell-tale and monitor,
Anno Domini 1851, instructs me that a quarter of a century has nearly slipped by since the
first scene in the complicated play of circumstances opened upon me. The date I remember well,
for the Tower-guns had been proclaiming with their thunder-throats the victory of Navarino
but a short time before a clerk announced, "William Martin, with a message from Major Stewart."

This William Martin was a rather sorry curiosity in his way. He was now in the service of our
old client, Major Stewart; and a tall, good-looking fellow enough, spite of a very decided
cast in his eyes, which the rascal, when in his cups--no unusual occurrence--declared he had
caught from his former masters--Edward Thorneycroft, Esq., an enormously rich and exceedingly
yellow East India director, and his son, Mr. Henry Thorneycroft, with whom, until lately transferred
to Major Stewart's service, he had lived from infancy--his mother and father having formed
part of the elder Thorneycroft's establishment when he was born. He had a notion in his head
that he had better blood in his veins than the world supposed, and was excessively fond of
aping the gentleman; and this he did, I must say, with the ease and assurance of a stage-player.
His name was scarcely out of the clerk's lips when he entered the inner office with a great
effort at steadiness and deliberation, closed the door very carefully and importantly, hung
his hat with much precision on a brass peg, and then steadying himself by the door-handle,
surveyed the situation and myself with staring lack-lustre eyes and infinite gravity. I saw
what was the matter.

"You have been in the 'Sun,' Mr. Martin?"

A wink, inexpressible by words, replied to me, and I could see by the motion of the fellow's
lips that speech was attempted; but it came so thick that it was several minutes before I made
out that he meant to say the British had been knocking the Turks about like bricks, and that
he had been patriotically drinking the healths of the said British or bricks.

"Have the goodness, sir, to deliver your message, and then instantly leave the office."

"Old Tho-o-o-rney," was the hiccoughed reply, "has smoked the--the plot. Young Thorney's done
for. Ma-a-aried in a false name; tra-ansportation--of course."

"What gibberish is this about old Thorney and young Thorney? Do you not come from Major Stewart?"

"Ye-e-es, that's right; the route's arrived for the old trump; wishes to--to see you"

"Major Stewart dying! Why, you are a more disgraceful scamp than I believed you to be. Send
this fellow away," I added to a clerk who answered my summons. I then hastened off, and was
speedily rattling over the stones towards Baker Street, Portman Square, where Major Stewart
resided. As I left the office I heard Martin beg the clerk to lead him to the pump previous
to sending him off--no doubt for the purpose of sobering himself somewhat previous to reappearing
before the major, whose motives for hiring or retaining such a fellow in his modest establishment
I could not understand.

"You were expected more than an hour ago," said Dr. Hampton, who was just leaving the house.
"The major is now, I fear, incapable of business."

There was no time for explanation, and I hastily entered the sick-chamber. Major Stewart, though
rapidly sinking, recognized me; and in obedience to a gesture from her master the aged, weeping
house-keeper left the room. The major's daughter, Rosamond Stewart, had been absent with her
aunt, her father's maiden sister, on a visit, I understood, to some friends in Scotland, and
had not, I concluded, been made acquainted with the major's illness, which had only assumed
a dangerous character a few days previously. The old soldier was dying calmly and painlessly--rather
from exhaustion of strength, a general failure of the powers of life, than from any especial
disease. A slight flush tinged the mortal pallor of his face as I entered, and the eyes emitted
a slightly-reproachful expression.

"It is not more, my dear sir," I replied softly but eagerly to his look, "than a quarter of
an hour ago that I received your message."

I do not know whether he comprehended or even distinctly heard what I said, for his feeble
but extremely anxious glance was directed whilst I spoke to a large oil-portrait of Rosamond
Stewart, suspended over the mantel-piece. The young lady was a splendid, dark-eyed beauty,
and of course the pride and darling of her father. Presently wrenching, as it were, his eyes
from the picture, he looked in my face with great earnestness, and bending my ear close to
his lips, I heard him feebly and brokenly say, "A question to ask you, that's all; read--read!"
His hand motioned towards a letter which lay open on the bed; I ran it over, and the major's
anxiety was at once explained. Rosamond Stewart had, I found, been a short time previously
married in Scotland to Henry Thorneycroft, the son of the wealthy East India director. Finding
his illness becoming serious, the major had anticipated the time and mode in which the young
people had determined to break the intelligence to the irascible father of the bridegroom,
and the result was the furious and angry letter in reply which I was perusing. Mr. Thorneycroft
would never, he declared, recognize the marriage of his undutiful nephew--nephew, not son;
for he was, the letter announced, the child of an only sister, whose marriage had also mortally
offended Mr. Thorneycroft, and had been brought up from infancy as his (Mr. Thorneycroft's)
son, in order that the hated name of Allerton, to which the boy was alone legally entitled,
might never offend his ear. There was something added insinuative of a doubt of the legality
of the marriage, in consequence of the misnomer of the bridegroom at the ceremony.

"One question," muttered the major, as I finished the perusal of the letter--"Is Rosamond's
marriage legal?"

"No question about it. How could any one suppose that an involuntary misdescription can affect
such a contract?"

"Enough--enough!" he gasped. "A great load is gone!--the rest is with God. Beloved Rosamond"--The
slight whisper was no longer audible; sighs, momently becoming fainter and weaker, followed--ceased,
and in little more than ten minutes after the last word was spoken, life was extinct. I rang
the bell, and turned to leave the room, and as I did so surprised Martin on the other side
of the bed. He had been listening, screened by the thick damask curtains, and appeared to be
a good deal sobered. I made no remark, and proceeded on down stairs. The man followed, and
as soon as we had gained the hall said quickly, yet hesitatingly, "Sir--sir!"

"Well, what have you to say?"

"Nothing very particular, sir. But did I understand you to say just now, that it was of no
consequence if a man married in a false name?"

"That depends upon circumstances. Why do you ask?"

"Oh, nothing--nothing; only I have heard it's transportation, especially if there's money."

"Perhaps you are right. Anything else?"

"No," said he, opening the door; "that's all--mere curiosity."

I heard nothing more of the family for some time, except with reference to Major Stewart's
personal property, about £4000 bequeathed to his daughter, with a charge thereon of an annuity
of £20 a year for Mrs. Leslie, the aged house-keeper; the necessary business connected with
which we transacted. But about a twelvemonth after the major's death, the marriage of the elder
Thorneycroft with a widow of the same name as himself, and a cousin, the paper stated, was
announced; and pretty nearly a year and a half subsequent to the appearance of this ominous
paragraph, the decease of Mr. Henry Thorneycroft at Lausanne, in Switzerland, who had left,
it was added in the newspaper stock-phrase of journalism, a young widow and two sons to mourn
their irreparable loss. Silence again, as far as we were concerned, settled upon the destinies
of the descendants of our old military client, till one fine morning a letter from Dr. Hampton
informed us of the sudden death by apoplexy, a few days previously, of the East India director.
Dr. Hampton further hinted that he should have occasion to write us again in a day or two,
relative to the deceased's affairs, which, owing to Mr. Thorneycroft's unconquerable aversion
to making a will, had, it was feared, been left in an extremely unsatisfactory state. Dr. Hampton
had written to us, at the widow's request, in consequence of his having informed her that we
had been the professional advisers of Major Stewart, and were in all probability those of his
daughter, Mrs. Henry Allerton.

We did not quite comprehend the drift of this curious epistle; but although not specially instructed,
we determined at once to write to Mrs. Rosamond Thorneycroft or Allerton, who with her family
was still abroad, and in the meantime take such formal steps in her behalf as might appear
necessary.

We were not long in doubt as to the motives of the extremely civil application to ourselves
on the part of the widow of the East India director. The deceased's wealth had been almost
all invested in land, which went, he having died intestate, to his nephew's son, Henry Allerton;
and the personals in which the widow would share were consequently of very small amount. Mrs.
Thorneycroft was, therefore, anxious to propose, through us, a more satisfactory and equitable
arrangement. We could of course say nothing till the arrival of Mrs. Rosamond Allerton, for
which, however, we had only a brief time to wait. There were, we found, no indisposition on
that lady's part to act with generosity towards Mr. Thorneycroft's widow--a showy, vulgarish
person, by the way, of about forty years of age--but there was a legal difficulty in the way,
in consequence of the heir-at-law being a minor. Mrs. Thorneycroft became at length terribly
incensed, and talked a good deal of angry nonsense about disputing the claim of Henry Allerton's
son to the estates, on the ground that his marriage, having been contracted in a wrong name,
was null and void. Several annoying paragraphs got in consequence into the Sunday newspapers,
and these brought about a terrible disclosure.

About twelve o'clock one day, the Widow Thorneycroft bounced unceremoniously into the office,
dragging in with her a comely and rather interesting-looking young woman, but of a decidedly
rustic complexion and accent, and followed by a grave, middle-aged clergyman. The widow's large
eyes sparkled with strong excitement, and her somewhat swarthy features were flushed with hot
blood.

"I have brought you," she burst out abruptly, "the real Mrs. Allerton, and"--

"No, no!" interrupted the young woman, who appeared much agitated--"Thorneycroft, not Allerton!"--

"I know, child--I know; but that is nothing to the purpose. This young person, Mr. Sharp, is,
I repeat, the true and lawful Mrs. Henry Allerton."

"Pooh!" I answered; "do you take us for idiots? This," I added with some sternness, "is either
a ridiculous misapprehension or an attempt at imposture, and I am very careless which it may be."

"You are mistaken, sir," rejoined the clergyman mildly. "This young woman was certainly married
by me at Swindon church, Wilts, to a gentleman of the name of Henry Thorneycroft, who, it appears
from the newspapers, confirmed by this lady, was no other than Mr. Henry Allerton. This marriage,
we find, took place six months previously to that contracted with Rosamond Stewart. I have
further to say that this young woman, Maria Emsbury, is a very respectable person, and that
her marriage-portion, of a little more than eight hundred pounds, was given to her husband,
whom she has only seen thrice since her marriage, to support himself till the death of his
reputed father, constantly asserted by him to be imminent."

"A story very smoothly told, and I have no doubt in your opinion quite satisfactory; but there
is one slight matter which I fancy you will find somewhat difficult of proof--I mean the identity
of Maria Emsbury's husband with the son or nephew of the late Mr. Thorneycroft."

"He always said he was the son of the rich East Indian, Mr. Thorneycroft," said the young woman
with a hysterical sob; "and here," she added, "is his picture in his wedding-dress--that of
an officer of the Gloucestershire Yeomanry. He gave it me the day before the wedding."

I almost snatched the portrait. Sure enough it was a miniature of Henry Allerton--there could
be no doubt about that.

Mr. Flint, who had been busy with some papers, here approached and glanced at the miniature.

I was utterly confounded, and my partner, I saw, was equally dismayed; and no wonder, entertaining
as we both did the highest respect and admiration for the high-minded and beautiful daughter
of Major Stewart.

The Widow Thorneycroft's exultation was exuberant.

"As this only legal marriage," said she, "has been blessed with no issue, I am of course, as
you must be aware, the legitimate heiress-at-law, as my deceased husband's nearest blood-relative.
I shall, however," she added, "take care to amply provide for my widowed niece-in-law."

The young woman made a profound rustic courtesy, and tears of unaffected gratitude, I observed,
filled her eyes.

The game was not, however, to be quite so easily surrendered as they appeared to imagine. "Tut!
tut!" exclaimed Mr. Flint bluntly--"this may be mere practice. Who knows how the portrait has
been obtained?"

The girl's eyes flashed with honest anger. There was no practice about her I felt assured.
"Here are other proofs: My husband's signet-ring, left accidentally, I think, with me, and
two letters which I from curiosity took out of his coat-pocket--the day, I am pretty sure it
was, after we were married."

"If this cumulative circumstantial evidence does not convince you, gentlemen," added the Rev.
Mr. Wishart, "I have direct personal testimony to offer. You know Mr. Angerstein of Bath?"

"I do."

"Well, Mr. Henry Thorneycroft or Allerton, was at the time this marriage took place, on a visit
to that gentleman; and I myself saw the bridegroom, whom I had united a fortnight previously
in Swindon church, walking arm-and-arm with Mr. Angerstein in Sydney Gardens, Bath. I was at
some little distance, but I recognized both distinctly, and bowed. Mr. Angerstein returned
my salutation, and he recollects the circumstance distinctly. The gentleman walking with him
in the uniform of the Gloucestershire Yeomanry was, Mr. Angerstein is prepared to depose, Mr.
Henry Thorneycroft or Allerton."

"You waste time, reverend sir," said Mr. Flint with an affectation of firmness and unconcern
he was, I knew, far from feeling. "We are the attorneys of Mrs. Rosamond Allerton, and shall,
I dare say, if you push us to it, be able to tear this ingeniously-colored cobweb of yours
to shreds. If you determine on going to law, your solicitor can serve us; we will enter an
appearance, and our client will be spared unnecessary annoyance."

They were about to leave, when, as ill-luck would have it, one of the clerks who, deceived
by the momentary silence, and from not having been at home when the unwelcome visitors arrived,
believed we were disengaged, opened the door, and admitted Mrs. Rosamond Allerton and her aunt,
Miss Stewart. Before we could interpose with a word, the Widow Thorneycroft burst out with
the whole story in a torrent of exultant Volubility that it was impossible to check or restrain.

For awhile contemptuous incredulity, indignant scorn, upheld the assailed lady; but as proof
after proof was hurled at her, reinforced by the grave soberness of the clergyman and the weeping
sympathy of the young woman, her firmness gave way, and she swooned in her aunt's arms. We
should have more peremptorily interfered but for our unfortunate client's deprecatory gestures.
She seemed determined to hear the worst at once. Now, however, we had the office cleared of
the intruders without much ceremony and, as soon as the horror-stricken lady was sufficiently
recovered, she was conducted to her carriage, and after arranging for an early interview on
the morrow, was driven off.

I found our interesting, and, I feared, deeply-injured client much recovered from the shock
which on the previous day had overwhelmed her; and although exceedingly pale--lustrously so,
as polished Parian marble--and still painfully agitated, there was hope, almost confidence,
in her eye and tone.

"There is some terrible misapprehension in this frightful affair, Mr. Sharp," she began. "Henry,
my husband, was utterly incapable of a mean or dishonest act, much less of such utter baseness
as this of which he is accused. They also say, do they not," she continued, with a smile of
haughty contempt, "that he robbed the young woman of her poor dowry--some eight hundred pounds?
A proper story!"

"That, I confess, from what little I know of Mr. Henry Thorneycroft, stamps the whole affair
as a fabrication; and yet the Reverend Mr. Wishart--a gentleman of high character, I understand--is
very positive. The young woman, too, appeared truthful and sincere."

"Yes--it cannot be denied. Let me say also--for it is best to look at the subject on its darkest
side--I find, on looking over my letters, that my husband was staying with Mr. Angerstein at
the time stated. He was also at that period in the Gloucestershire Yeomanry. I gave William
Martin, but the other day, a suit of his regimentals very little the worse for wear."

"You forget to state, Rosamond," said Miss Stewart, who was sitting beside her niece, "that
Martin, who was with his young master at Bath, is willing to make oath that no such marriage
took place as asserted, at Swindon church."

"That alone would, I fear, my good madam, very little avail. Can I see William Martin?"

"Certainly." The bell was rung, and the necessary order given.

"This Martin is much changed for the better, I hear?"

"O yes, entirely so," said Miss Stewart. "He is also exceedingly attached to us all, the children
especially; and his grief and anger, when informed of what had occurred, thoroughly attest
his faithfulness and sincerity."

Martin entered, and was, I thought, somewhat confused by my apparently unexpected presence.
A look at his face and head dissipated a half-suspicion that had arisen in both Flint's mind
and my own.

I asked him a few questions relative to the sojourn of his master at Bath, and then said, "I
wish you to go with me and Bee this Maria Emsbury."

As I spoke, something seemed to attract Martin's attention in the street, and suddenly turning
round, his arm swept a silver pastil-stand off the table. He stooped down to gather up the
dispersed pastils, and as he did so, said, in answer to my request, "that he had not the slightest
objection to do so."

"That being the case, we will set off at once, as she and her friends are probably at the office
by this time. They are desirous of settling the matter off-hand," I added with a smile, addressing
Mrs. Allerton, "and avoiding, if possible, the delays and uncertainties of the law."

As I anticipated, the formidable trio were with Mr. Flint. I introduced Martin, and as I did
so, watched, with an anxiety I could hardly have given a reason for, the effect of his appearance
upon the young woman. I observed nothing. He was evidently an utter stranger to her, although,
from the involuntary flush which crossed his features, it occurred to me that he was in some
way an accomplice with his deceased master in the cruel and infamous crime which had, I strongly
feared, been perpetrated.

"Was this person present at your marriage?" I asked.

"Certainly not. But I think--now I look at him--that I have seen him somewhere--about Swindon,
it must have been."

William Martin mumbled out that he had never been in Swindon; neither, he was sure, had his master.

"What is that?" said the girl, looking sharply up, and suddenly coloring--"What is that?"

Martin, a good deal abashed, again mumbled out his belief that young Mr. Thorneycroft, as he
was then called, had never been at Swindon.

The indignant scarlet deepened on the young woman's face and temples, and she looked at Martin
with fixed attention and surprise. Presently recovering, as if from some vague confusedness
of mind, she said, "What you believe, can be no consequence--truth is truth, for all that."

The Rev. Mr. Wishart here interposed, remarking that as it was quite apparent we were determined
to defend the usurpation by Miss Rosamond Stewart--a lady to be greatly pitied, no doubt--of
another's right, it was useless to prolong or renew the interview; and all three took immediate
leave. A few minutes afterward Martin also departed, still vehemently asserting that no such
marriage ever took place at Swindon or anywhere else.

No stone, as people say, was left unturned by us, in the hope of discovering some clue that
might enable us to unravel the tangled web of coherent, yet, looking at the character of young
Mr. Allerton, improbable circumstance. We were unsuccessful, and unfortunately many other particulars
which came to light but deepened the adverse complexion of the case. Two respectable persons
living at Swindon were ready to depose on oath that they had on more than one occasion seen
Maria Emsbury's sweetheart with Mr. Angerstein at Bath--once especially at the theatre, upon
the benefit-night of the great Edmund Kean, who had been playing there for a few nights.

The entire case, fully stated, was ultimately laid by us before eminent counsel--one of whom
is now, by the by, a chief-justice--and we were advised that the evidence as set forth by us
could not be contended against with any chance of success. This sad result was communicated
by me to Mrs. Allerton, as she still unswervingly believed herself to be, and was borne with
more constancy and firmness than I had expected. Her faith in her husband's truth and honor
was not in the slightest degree shaken by the accumulated proofs. She would not, however, attempt
to resist them before a court of law. Something would, she was confident, thereafter come to
light that would vindicate the truth, and confiding in our zeal and watchfulness, she, her
aunt, and children, would in the meantime shelter themselves from the gaze of the world in
their former retreat at Lausanne.

This being the unhappy lady's final determination, I gave the other side notice that we should
be ready on a given day to surrender possession of the house and effects in South Audley Street,
which the Widow Thorneycroft had given up to her supposed niece-in-law and family on their
arrival in England, and to re-obtain which, and thereby decide the whole question in dispute,
legal proceedings had already been commenced.

On the morning appointed for the purpose--having taken leave of the ladies the day previously--I
proceeded to South Audley Street, to formally give up possession, under protest, however. The
niece and aunt were not yet gone. This, I found, was owing to Martin, who, according to the
ladies, was so beside himself with grief and rage that he had been unable to expedite as he
ought to have done, the packing intrusted to his care. I was vexed at this, as the Widow Thorneycroft,
her protégée, and the Rev. Mr. Wishart, accompanied by a solicitor, were shortly expected;
and it was desirable that a meeting of the antagonistic parties should be avoided. I descended
to the lower regions to remonstrate with and hurry Martin, and found, as I feared, that his
former evil habits had returned upon him. Younker is the libertine,'element arrive; the activity

"Nonsense, Alfred!" said old Mr. Gray. "I would not grudge you the money if you did not want
it for a bad purpose. You must not excuse men who go out with guns and fire at their fellow-creatures
in the dark."

"Martin did not fire, uncle--that is what I want to prove, and save him, if I can, from transportation.
He has a wife and child."

"Wife and child!" repeated the old man thoughtfully. "You did not tell me he had a wife and
child; that poor woman came from Uffeulme."

"Providence must have guided her," said the younger Gray. "It was indeed Harvey's wife and
son whom you so lately relieved."

"You shall have the money. I have all through life prayed that my heart may not be hardened;
and I find, old as I am, that, every day I have fresh lessons to learn."

The next morning, while Alfred held anxious consultation with the lawyers, the wife and husband
met within the prison walls. They sat together in silence, for neither could speak a single
word of hope. The boy never forgot that long and dreary day, during which he watched, with
wondering thoughts, the sad faces of his ruined parents.

The Crown Court of the Castle was next morning crowded to overflowing. Among the struggling
crowd that vainly sought to gain admission, was Martin Harvey's wife. She was rudely repulsed
by the door-keepers, who "wondered what women wanted in such places." She still strove to keep
her ground, and watched with piteous looks the doors of the court. She braved the heat and
pressure for some time; but a sickly faintness at length came over her. She was endeavoring
to retreat into the open air, when she felt some one touch her shoulder, and turning, saw Alfred
Gray making his way toward her. After a moment's pause in the cool air, he led her round to
a side-door, through which there was a private entrance into the court. He whispered a word
to an officer, who admitted them, and pointed to a seat behind the dock, where they were screened
from observation, and where the woman could see her husband standing between his two fellow-prisoners.

The prisoners were listening anxiously to the evidence which the principal game-keeper was
offering against them. The first, a man about sixty, excited greater interest than the others.
He earnestly attended to what was going on, but gave no sign of fear, as to the result. Brushing
back his gray locks, he gazed round the court, with something like a smile. This man's life
had been a strange one. Early in his career he had been ejected from a farm which he had held
under the father of the present prosecutor, Sir George Roberts; he soon after lost what little
property had been left him, and, in despair enlisted--was sent abroad with his regiment--and
for many years shared in the toils and achievements of our East Indian warfare. Returning home
on a small pension, he fixed his abode in his native village, and sought to indulge his old
enmity against the family that had injured him by every kind of annoyance in his power. The
present baronet, a narrow-minded tyrannical man, afforded by his unpopularity good opportunity
to old Ralph Somers to induce others to join him in his schemes of mischief and revenge. "The
game," which was plentiful on the estate, and the preservation of which was Sir George's chief
delight, formed the principal object of attack; the poverty of the laborers tempted them to
follow the old soldier, who managed affairs so warily, that for nine years he had been an object
of the utmost terror and hatred to Sir George and his keepers, whilst all their efforts to
detect and capture him had, until now, been fruitless.

Martin Harvey, who stood by his side with his shattered arm in a sling, bore marks of acute
mental suffering and remorse; but his countenance was stamped with its original, open, manly
expression--a face often to be seen among a group of English farm laborers, expressive of a
warm heart, full of both courage and kindness.

The evidence was soon given. The game-keepers, on the night of the 24th of February, were apprised
that poachers were in the plantations. Taking with them a stronger force than usual, all well-armed,
they discovered the objects of their search, in a lane leading out into the fields, and shouted
to them to surrender. They distinctly saw their figures flying before them, and when they approached
them, one of the fugitives turned round and fired, wounding one of the keepers' legs with a
quantity of small shot. The keeper immediately fired in return, and brought down a poacher;
old Ralph's voice was heard shouting to them to desist, and upon coming up they found him standing
by the side of Martin Harvey, who had fallen severely wounded. Three guns lay by them, one
of which had been discharged, but no one could swear who had fired it; search was made all
night for the other man, but without success.

When the prisoners were called on for their defence, they looked at one another for a moment
as if neither wished to speak first; Ralph, however, began. He had little to say. Casting a
look of defiance at Sir George and his lady, who sat in a side-gallery above the court, he
freely confessed that hatred to the man who had injured him in his youth, and who had treated
him with harshness on his return from abroad, had been the motive of his encouraging and aiding
in these midnight depredations; he expressed sorrow for having occasioned trouble to his neighbor
Harvey. "What I can say will be of little use to me here," said Martin Harvey, in a hollow
voice; "I am ruined, beyond redress; but I was a very poor man when I first joined, with others,
in snaring game; I often wanted bread, and saw my wife and child pinched for food also. The
rich people say game belongs to them; but--well--all I can say more is, that I take God to
witness I never lifted a murderous gun against my fellow-man; he who did it has escaped; and
I have suffered this broken limb--but that I don't mind--I have worse than that to bear--I
have broken my wife's heart, and my child will be left an orphan."

His voice failed. There was an uneasy movement among the audience: and a lady, who had been
leaning over the rails of the side-gallery listening with deep attention, fainted, and was
carried out of court. The prisoner's pale wife, who had bowed her head behind him in silent
endurance, heard a whisper among the bystanders that it was Lady Roberts, and a hope entered
her mind that the lady's tender heart might feel for them.

"Have you any witnesses to call?" asked the Judge.

Martin looked round with a vacant gaze; the attorney whispered to him, and beckoned to Alfred Gray.

Alfred went into the witness-box, and told of the honesty, sobriety, and good conduct of Martin
Harvey, during all the years he was in his father's house--"He was there before I was born,"
said the young man, "and only left when I was obliged to leave also, sixteen years after. A
better man never broke bread--he was beloved by every body who knew him. Till now his character
was never tainted. It's the one black spot."

The Judge commenced summing up; it was evident to all who had paid attention to the evidence,
that the conviction of two of the prisoners was certain. Alfred Gray knew this, and strove
to induce the wife to leave with him before the fatal close of proceedings; but she shook her
head and would not go. "I shall have strength to bear it," she said.

He sat down by her side, and heard the fearful verdict of "guilty" pronounced against her husband
and Ralph Somers; and then the dreaded doom of transportation for life awarded to them. As
they turned to leave the dock, Martin looked down upon the crushed and broken-hearted being
whom he had sworn to protect and cherish through life, and in spite of every effort to repress
it, a cry of agony burst from his lips; it was answered by a fainter sound, and Alfred Gray
lifted the helpless, lifeless woman from the ground, and carried her into the open air.

Months passed; and on the day when the convict ship, with its freight of heavy hearts, began
its silent course over the greatwaters, the widowed wife took her fatherless child by the hand,
and again traversed the weary road which led them to their desolated home.

The kindness of the Grays had supplied a few immediate necessaries. Some one had told her of
women having, by the aid of friends, managed to meet their husbands once more in those distant
parts of the earth; and this knowledge once in her agitated mind, raised a hope which inspired
her to pursue her daily task without fainting, and to watch an opportunity of making an attempt
which she had meditated, even during that dreadful day of Martin's trial. She resolved to seek
admission into Sir George Roberts' mansion, and appeal to the pity of his wife. It was told
in the village that Lady Roberts had implored her husband to interpose in behalf of the men;
that his angry and passionate refusal had caused a breach between them; that they had lived
unhappily ever since; that he had strictly forbidden any one to mention the subject, or to
convey to Lady Roberts any remarks that were made in the neighborhood.

Susan Harvey trembled when she entered the mansion, and timidly asked leave to speak to Lady
Roberts.

The servant she addressed had known her husband, and pitied her distress; and, fearing lest
Sir George might pass, he led her into his pantry, watching an opportunity to let the lady
know of her being there.

After a time Lady Roberts' maid came, and beckoned her to follow up-stairs. In a few moments
the soft voice of the lady of the mansion was cheering her with kind words, and encouraging
her to disclose her wishes.

Before she had concluded, a step was heard without, at which the lady started and turned pale.
Before there was time for retreat Sir George hastily entered the apartment.

"Who have you here, Lady Roberts?"

"One who has a request to make, I believe," said the lady, mildly. "I wish a few moments with her."

"Have the goodness to walk out of this house," said the baronet to Susan. "Lady Roberts, I
know this woman and I will not allow you to harbor such people here."

Although the convict's wife never again ventured into that house, her wants, and those of her
child, were, during three years, ministered to by the secret agency of the Good Heart that
lived so sadly there; and when, at the expiration of that period, Lady Roberts died, a trusty
messenger brought to the cottage a little legacy--sufficient, if ever news came of Martin,
to enable the wife and child, from whom he was separated, to make their way across the earth,
and to meet him again.

But during those weary years no tidings of his fate had reached either his wife or Alfred Gray--to
whom he had promised to write when he reached his destination. Another year dragged its slow
course over the home of affliction, and poor Susan's hopes grew fainter day by day. Her sinking
frame gave evidence of the sickness that cometh from the heart.

One summer evening, in the next year, Alfred Gray, entered his uncle's garden with a letter,
and was soon seated in the summer-house reading it aloud to his uncle and Martha. Tears stood
in the old man's eyes, as some touching detail of suffering or privation was related. And,
indeed, the letter told of little beside. It was from Martin. Soon after his arrival in the
settlement, Martin had written to Alfred, but the letter had never reached England--not an
unusual occurrence in those times. After waiting long, and getting no reply, he was driven
by harsh treatment, and the degradation attending the life he led, to attempt, with old Ralph,
an escape from the settlement. In simple language, he recorded the dreary life they led in
the woods; how, after a time, old Ralph sickened and died; and how, in a desolate place, where
the footsteps of man had, perhaps, never trod before, Martin Harvey had dug a grave, and buried
his old companion. After that, unable to endure the terrible solitude, he had sought his way
back to his former master, and had been treated more harshly than before. Fever and disease
had wasted his frame, until he had prayed that he might die and be at rest; but God had been
merciful to him, and had inclined the heart of one for whom he labored, who listened with compassion
to his story, took him under his roof, and restored him to health. And now, Martin had obtained
a ticket of leave, and served his kind master for wages, which he was carefully hoarding to
send to Alfred Gray, as soon as he should hear from him that those he loved were still preserved,
and would come and embrace him once more in that distant land.

"They shall go at once, Alfred," said old Mr. Gray, the moment the last sentence was read;
"they shall not wait; we will provide the means--hey, Martha?"

He did not now fear to appeal to his companion. Martha had grown kinder of late, and she confessed
she had learned of her cousin what gives most comfort to those who are drawing near their journey's
end. "I can help them a little," she said.

"We will all help a little," Alfred replied. "I shall be off at break of day to-morrow, on
neighbor Collins's pony, and shall give him no rest until he sets me down at Uffeulme."

Accordingly, early next morning, Alfred Gray was riding briskly along through the pleasant
green lanes which led toward his native village. It was the middle of June, bright, warm, sunny
weather; and the young man's spirits was unusually gay, everything around him tending to heighten
the delight which the good news he carried had inspired him with. The pony stepped out bravely,
and was only checked when Alfred came in sight of the dear old home of his childhood, and heard
the well-known chimes calling the villagers to their morning service, for it was Sunday. Then
for a few moments the young man proceeded more slowly, and his countenance wore a more saddened
look, as the blessed recollections of early loves and affections with which the scene was associated
in his mind, claimed their power over all other thoughts. The voice of an old friend, from
an apple-orchard hard by, recalled him from his reveries.

He shook hands through the hedge. "I will come and see you in the evening, Fred. I must hasten
on now. She will go to church this morning, and I must go with her."

"Who?" asked the other.

Alfred pointed to the cottage where Susan Harvey dwelt. "I bring her good news--I have a letter.
Martin is living and well."

The friend shook his head.

Alfred dismounted, and walked towards Susan Harvey's cottage. The door was closed, and when
he looked through the window he could see no one inside. He lifted the latch softly and entered.
There was no one there; but his entrance had been heard, and a moment after, a fine stout lad
came out of the inner chamber, took Alfred's proffered hand, and in answer to his inquiries,
burst into tears.

"She says she cannot live long, sir; but she told me last night, that before she died, you
would come and tell us news of father. She has been saying all the past week that we should
hear from him soon."

Whilst the boy spoke, Alfred heard a weak voice, calling his name from the inner room.

"Go in," he said, "and tell her I am here."

The boy did so, and then beckoned him to enter.

Susan's submissive features were but little changed, from the time when her husband was taken
from her; but the weak and wasted form that strove to raise itself in vain, as Alfred approached
the bed-side, too plainly revealed that the struggle was drawing to a close--that the time
of rest was at hand.

"Thank God, you are come," she said; "you have heard from him? Tell me quickly, for my time
is short."

"I come to tell you good news, Susan. You may yet be restored to him."

"I shall not see Martin in this world again, Mr. Gray; but I shall close my eyes in peace.
If you know where he is, and can tell me that my boy shall go and be with him, and tell him
how, through these long weary years, we loved him, and thought of him, and prayed for him--"
Here she broke off, and beckoned the boy to her. She held his hands within her own, whilst
Alfred Gray read from the letter all that would comfort her.

When he had done, she said, "God will bless you--you have been very good to us in our misery.
Now, will you promise me one thing more? Will you send my boy to his father, when I am gone?"

The promise was made; and the boy knelt long by her bedside, listening to the words of love
and consolation which, with her latest breath, she uttered for the sake of him who, she hoped,
would hear them again from his child's lips.

       *       *       *       *       *

Nearly forty years have passed since they laid her among the graves of the humble villagers
of Uffeulme. Few remain now who remember her story or her name--but, on the other side of the
world, amid scenery all unlike to that in which she dwelt, there stands a cheerful settler's
home, and under the shadow of tall acacia trees which surround the little garden in which some
few English flowers are blooming, there are sitting, in the cool of the summer evening, a group
whose faces are all of the Anglo-Saxon mould. A happy looking couple, in the prime of life,
are there, with children playing around them; and one little gentle girl, they call Susan,
is sitting on the knee of an aged, white-haired man, looking lovingly into his face, and wondering
why his eye so watches the setting sun every night, as it sinks behind the blue waters in the
distance. Two tall, handsome lads, with guns on their shoulders, enter the garden, and hasten
to show the old man the fruits of their day's exploits.

"We have been lucky to-day, grandfather," says the younger; "but Alfred says these birds are
not like the birds in old England."

"You should hear the sailors talk about the game in England, Martin," replies the brother.

"Grandfather has told us all about England, except the 'birds.' He thinks we should run away,
if he were to describe them."

The old man looks steadily at the boys for a moment, and his eyes fill with tears. "It is a
glorious land," he says, with a faltering voice; "it is our country; but, Alfred, Martin, you
will never leave this happy home to go there. Birds there are the rich man's property, and
you would not dare carry those guns of yours over English ground. If ever you go there, your
father will tell you where there is a church-yard--and among the graves of the poor, there
is one--"

He stopped, for Edward Harvey came to the place where his father sat, and took his trembling
hand within his own; the boys obeyed their mother's signal, and followed her into the house;
the two men remained sitting together, until the silent stars came out.

Then the aged man, leaning on his son's arm, rejoined the family at the supper-table--and the
peace of God rested on the solitary home. Edward Harvey had faithfully kept within his heart,
the memory of his mother's dying commands.

Martin, his father, had nobly effaced the one Black Spot.

THE GENTLEMAN BEGGAR.

One morning, about five years ago, I called by appointment on Mr. John Balance, the fashionable
pawnbroker, to accompany him to Liverpool, in pursuit of a Levanting customer--for Balance,
in addition to pawning, does a little business in the sixty per cent. line. It rained in torrents
when the cab stopped at the passage which leads past the pawning-boxes to his private door.
The cabman rang twice, and at length Balance appeared, looming through the mist and rain in
the entry, illuminated by his perpetual cigar. As I eyed him rather impatiently, remembering
that trains wait for no man, something like a hairy dog, or a bundle of rags, rose up at his
feet, and barred his passage for a moment. Then Balance cried out with an exclamation, in answer
apparently to a something I could not hear, "What, man alive!--slept in the passage!--there,
take that, and get some breakfast, for Heaven's sake!" So saying, he jumped into the "Hansom,"
and we bowled away at ten miles an hour, just catching the Express as the doors of the station
were closing. My curiosity was full set--for although Balance can be free with his money, it
is not exactly to beggars that his generosity is usually displayed; so when comfortably ensconced
in a coupé I finished with--

"You are liberal with your money this morning; pray, how often do you give silver to street-cadgers?--because
I shall know now what walk to take when flats and sharps leave off buying law."

Balance, who would have made an excellent parson if he had not been bred to a case-hardening
trade, and has still a soft bit left in his heart that is always fighting with his hard head,
did not smile at all, but looked as grim as if squeezing a lemon into his Saturday night's
punch. He answered slowly, "A cadger--yes; a beggar--a miserable wretch, he is now; but, let
me tell you, Master David, that that miserable bundle of rags was born and bred a gentleman--the
son of a nobleman, the husband of an heiress, and has sat and dined at tables where you and
I, Master David, are only allowed to view the plate by favor of the butler. I have lent him
thousands, and been well paid. The last thing I had from him was his court-suit; and I hold
now his bill for one hundred pounds that will be paid, I expect, when he dies."

"Why, what nonsense you are talking! you must be dreaming this morning. However, we are alone;
I'll light a weed, in defiance of Railway-law, while you spin that yarn; for, true or untrue,
it will fill up the time to Liverpool."

"As for yarn," replied Balance, "the whole story is short enough; and as for truth, that you
may easily find out if you like to take the trouble. I thought the poor wretch was dead, and
I own it put me out meeting him this morning, for I had a curious dream last night."

"Oh, hang your dreams! Tell us about this gentleman beggar that bleeds you of half-crowns--that
melts the heart even of a pawnbroker!"

"Well, then, that beggar is the illegitimate son of the late Marquis of Hoopborough by a Spanish
lady of rank. He received a first rate education, and was brought up in his father's house.
At a very early age he obtained an appointment in a public office, was presented by the marquis
at court, and received into the first society, where his handsome person and agreeable manners
made him a great favorite. Soon after coming of age, he married the daughter of Sir E. Bumper,
who brought him a very handsome fortune, which was strictly settled on herself. They lived
in splendid style, kept several carriages, a house in town, and a place in the country. For
some reason or other, idleness, or to please his lady's pride he said, he resigned his appointment.
His father died, and left him nothing; indeed, he seemed at that time very handsomely provided for.

"Very soon Mr. and Mrs. Molinos Fitz-Roy began to disagree. She was cold, correct--he was hot
and random. He was quite dependent on her, and she made him feel it. When he began to get into
debt, he came to me. At length some shocking quarrel occurred--some case of jealousy on the
wife's side, not without reason, I believe; and the end of it was, Mr. Fitz-Roy was turned
out of doors. The house was his wife's, the furniture was his wife's, and the fortune was his
wife's--he was, in fact, her pensioner. He left with a few hundred pounds ready money, and
some personal jewelry, and went to a hotel. On these and credit he lived. Being illegitimate,
he had no relations--being a fool, when he spent his money, he lost his friends. The world
took his wife's part, when they found she had the fortune, and the only parties who interfered
were her relatives, who did their best to make the quarrel incurable. To crown all, one night
he was run over by a cab, was carried to a hospital, and lay there for months, and was, during
several weeks of the time, unconscious. A message to the wife, by the hands of one of his debauched
companions, sent by a humane surgeon, obtained an intimation that 'if he died, Mr. Croak, the
undertaker to the family, had orders to see to the funeral,' and that Mrs. Molinos was on the
point of starting for the Continent, not to return for some years. When Fitz-Roy was discharged,
he came to me, limping on two sticks, to pawn his court-suit, and told me his story. I was
really sorry for the fellow--such a handsome, thoroughbred-looking man. He was going then into
the west somewhere, to try to hunt out a friend. 'What to do, Balance,' he said, 'I don't know.
I can't dig, and unless somebody will make me their gamekeeper, I must starve, or beg, as my
Jezebel bade me, when we parted!'

"I lost sight of Molinos for a long time, and when I next came upon him it was in the Rookery
of Westminster, in a low lodging-house, where I was searching with an officer for stolen goods.
He was pointed out to me as the 'gentleman-cadger,' because he was so free with his money when
'in luck.' He recognized me, but turned away then. I have since seen him, and relieved him
more than once, although he never asks for anything. How he lives, Heaven knows. Without money,
without friends, without useful education of any kind, he tramps the country, as you saw him,
perhaps doing a little hop-picking or hay-making, in season, only happy when he obtains the
means to get drunk. I have heard through the kitchen whispers that you know come to me, that
he is entitled to some property; and I expect if he were to die his wife would pay the hundred
pound bill I hold; at any rate, what I have told you I know to be true, and the bundle of rags
I relieved just now is known in every thieves' lodging in England as the 'gentleman cadger.'"

This story produced an impression on me: I am fond of speculation, and like the excitement
of a legal hunt as much as some do a fox-chase. A gentleman, a beggar--a wife rolling in wealth--rumors
of unknown property due to the husband;--it seemed as if there were pickings for me amidst
this carrion of pauperism.

Before returning from Liverpool, I had purchased the gentleman beggar's acceptance from Balance.
I then inserted in the "Times" the following advertisement: "Horatio Molinos Fitz-Roy.--If
this gentleman will apply to David Discount, Esq., Solicitor, St. James's, he will hear of
something to his advantage. Any person furnishing Mr. R's correct address, shall receive £1
1s. reward. He was last seen," &c. Within twenty-four hours I had ample proof of the wide circulation
of the "Times." My office was besieged with beggars of every degree, men and women, lame and
blind, Irish, Scotch, and English--some on crutches, some in bowls, some in go-carts. They
all knew him as "the gentleman," and I must do the regular fraternity of tramps the justice
to say, that not one would answer a question until he made certain that I meant the "gentleman"
no harm.

One evening, about three weeks after the appearance of the advertisement, my clerk announced
"another beggar." There came in an old man leaning upon a staff, clad in a soldier's greatcoat,
all patched and torn, with a battered hat, from under which a mass of tangled hair fell over
his shoulders and half concealed his face. The beggar, in a weak, wheezy, hesitating tone,
said, "You have advertized for Molinos Fitz-Roy. I hope you don't mean him any harm; he is
sunk, I think, too low for enmity now; and surely no one would sport with such misery as his."
These last words were uttered in a sort of piteous whisper.

I answered quickly, "Heaven forbid I should sport with misery--I mean and hope to do him good,
as well as myself."

"Then, sir, I am Molinos Fitz-Roy!"

While we were conversing candles had been brought in. I have not very tender nerves--my head
would not agree with them--but I own I started and shuddered when I saw and knew that the wretched
creature before me was under thirty years of age, and once a gentleman. Sharp, aquiline features,
reduced to literal skin and bone, were begrimed and covered with dry fair hair; the white teeth
of the half-open mouth chattered with eagerness, and made more hideous the foul pallor of the
rest of the countenance. As he stood leaning on a staff half bent, his long, yellow bony fingers
clasped over the crutch-head of his stick, he was indeed a picture of misery, famine, squalor,
and premature age, too horrible to dwell upon. I made him sit down, sent for some refreshment
which he devoured like a ghoul, and set to work to unravel his story. It was difficult to keep
him to the point; but with pains I learned what convinced me that he was entitled to some property,
whether great or small there was no evidence. On parting, I said, "Now, Mr. F, you must stay
in town while I make proper inquiries. What allowance will be enough to keep you comfortably?"

He answered humbly after much pressing, "Would you think ten shillings too much?"

I don't like, if I do those things at all, to do them shabbily--so I said, "Come every Saturday
and you shall have a pound." He was profuse in thanks, of course, as all such men are as long
as distress lasts.

I had previously learned that my ragged client's wife was in England, living in a splendid
house in Hyde Park Gardens, under her maiden name. On the following day the Earl of Owing called
upon me, wanting five thousand pounds by five o'clock the same evening. It was a case of life
or death with him, so I made my terms and took advantage of his pressure to execute a coup
de main. I proposed that he should drive me home to receive the money, calling at Mrs. Molinos
in Hyde Park Gardens, on our way. I knew that the coronet and liveries of his father, the Marquis,
would ensure me an audience with Mrs. Molinos Fitz-Roy.

My scheme answered. I was introduced into the lady's presence. She was, and probably is, a
very stately, handsome woman, with a pale complexion, high solid forehead, regular features,
thin, pinched, self-satisfied mouth. My interview was very short. I plunged into the middle
of the affair, but had scarcely mentioned the word husband, when she interrupted me with, "I
presume you have lent this profligate person money, and want me to pay you." She paused, and
then said, "He shall not have a farthing." As she spoke, her white face became scarlet.

"But, Madam, the man is starving. I have strong reasons for believing he is entitled to property,
and if you refuse any assistance, I must take other measures." She rang the bell, wrote something
rapidly on a card, and, as the footman appeared, pushed it towards me across the table, with
the air of touching a toad, saying, "There, sir, is the address of my solicitors; apply to
them if you think you have any claim. Robert, show the person out, and take care he is not
admitted again."

So far I had effected nothing; and, to tell the truth, felt rather crest-fallen under the influence
of that grand manner peculiar to certain great ladies and to all great actresses.

My next visit was to the attorneys, Messrs. Leasem and Fashun, of Lincoln's Inn Square; and
there I was at home. I had had dealings with the firm before. They are agents for half the
aristocracy, who always run in crowds like sheep after the same wine-merchants, the same architects,
the same horse-dealers, and the same law-agents. It may be doubted whether the quality of law
and land management they get on this principle is quite equal to their wine and horses. At
any rate, my friends of Lincoln's Inn, like others of the same class, are distinguished by
their courteous manners, deliberate proceedings, innocence of legal technicalities, long credit
and heavy charges. Leasem, the elder partner, wears powder and a huge bunch of seals, lives
in Queen Square, drives a brougham, gives the dinners and does the cordial department. He is
so strict in performing the latter duty, that he once addressed a poacher who had shot a Duke's
keeper, as "my dear creature," although he afterwards hung him.

Fashun has chambers in St. James Street, drives a cab, wears a tip, and does the grand haha style.

My business lay with Leasem. The interviews and letters passing were numerous. However, it
came at last to the following dialogue:--

"Well, my dear Mr. Discount," began Mr. Leasem, who hates me like poison, "I'm really very
sorry for that poor dear Molinos--knew his father well; a great man, a perfect gentleman; but
you know what women are, eh, Mr. Discount? My client won't advance a shilling; she knows it
would only be wasted in low dissipation. Now, don't you think (this was said very insinuatingly)--don't
you think he had better be sent to the work-house? Very comfortable accommodation there, I
can assure you--meat twice a week, and excellent soup; and then, Mr. D., we might consider
about allowing you something for that bill."

"Mr. Leasem, can you reconcile it to your conscience to make such an arrangement? Here's a
wife rolling in luxury, and a husband starving!"

"No, Mr. Discount, not starving; there is the work-house, as I observed before; besides, allow
me to suggest that these appeals to feeling are quite unprofessional--quite unprofessional."

"But, Mr. Leasem, touching this property which the poor man is entitled to?"

"Why, there again, Mr. D., you must excuse me; you really must. I don't say he is, I don't
say he is not. If you know he is entitled to property, I am sure you know how to proceed; the
law is open to you, Mr. Discount--the law is open; and a man of your talent will know how to
use it."

"Then, Mr. Leasem, you mean that I must, in order to right this starving man, file a Bill of
Discovery, to extract from you the particulars of his rights. You have the Marriage Settlement,
and all the information, and you decline to allow a pension, or afford any information; the
man is to starve, or go to the work-house?"

"Why, Mr. D., you are so quick and violent, it really is not professional; but you see, (here
a subdued smile of triumph,) it has been decided that a solicitor is not bound to afford such
information as you ask, to the injury of his client."

"Then you mean that this poor Molinos may rot and starve, while you keep secret from him, at
his wife's request, his title to an income, and that the Court of Chancery will back you in
this iniquity?"

I kept repeating the word "starve," because I saw it made my respectable opponent wince. "Well,
then, just listen to me: I know that in the happy state of our equity law, Chancery can't help
my client; but I have another plan--I shall go hence to my office, issue a writ, and take your
client's husband in execution--as soon as he is lodged in jail, I shall file his schedule in
the Insolvent Court, and when he comes up for his discharge, I shall put you in the witness-box,
and examine you on oath, 'touching any property of which you know the insolvent to be possessed,'
and where will be your privileged communications then?"

The respectable Leasem's face lengthened in a twinkling, his comfortable confident air vanished,
he ceased twiddling his gold chain, and at length he muttered, "Suppose we pay the debt?"

"Why, then, I'll arrest him the day after for another."

"But, my dear Mr. Discount, surely such conduct would not be quite respectable?"

"That's my business; my client has been wronged, I am determined to right him, and when the
aristocratic firm of Leasem and Fashun takes refuge according to the custom of respectable
repudiators, in the cool arbors of the Court of Chancery, why, a mere bill-discounting attorney
like David Discount, need not hesitate about cutting a bludgeon out of the Insolvent Court."

"Well, well, Mr. D., you are so warm--so fiery; we must deliberate, we must consult. You will
give me until the day after to-morrow, and then we'll write you our final determination; in
the meantime, send us a copy of your authority to act for Mr. Molinos Fitz-Roy."

Of course I lost no time in getting the gentleman beggar to sign a proper letter.

On the appointed day came a communication with the L. and F. seal, which I opened, not without
unprofessional eagerness. It was as follows:--

"In re Molinos Fitz-Roy and Another.

"Sir,--In answer to your application on behalf of Mr. Molinos Fitz-Roy, we beg to inform you
that, under the administration of a paternal aunt who died intestate, your client is entitled
to two thousand five hundred pounds eight shillings and sixpence, Three per Cents.; one thousand
five hundred pounds nineteen shillings and fourpence, Three per Cents., Reduced; one thousand
pounds, Long Annuities; five hundred pounds, Bank Stock; three thousand five hundred pounds,
India Stock, besides other securities, making up about ten thousand pounds, which we are prepared
to transfer over to Mr. Molinos Fitz-Roy's direction forthwith."

Here was a windfall! It quite took away my breath.

At dusk came my gentleman beggar, and what puzzled me was how to break the news to him. Being
very much overwhelmed with business that day, I had not much time for consideration. He came
in rather better dressed than when I first saw him, with only a week's beard on his chin; but,
as usual, not quite sober. Six weeks had elapsed since our first interview. He was still the
humble, trembling, low-voiced creature, I first knew him.

After a prelude, I said, "I find, Mr. F., you are entitled to something; pray, what do you
mean to give me in addition to my bill, for obtaining it?" He answered rapidly, "Oh, take half;
if there is one hundred pounds, take half--if there is five hundred pounds, take half."

"No, no; Mr. F., I don't do business in that way, I shall be satisfied with ten per cent."

It was so settled. I then led him out into the street, impelled to tell him the news, yet dreading
the effect; not daring to make the revelation in my office, for fear of a scene.

I began hesitatingly, "Mr. Fitz-Roy, I am happy to say that I find you are entitled to ...
ten thousand pounds!"

"Ten thousand pounds!" he echoed. "Ten thousand pounds!" he shrieked. "Ten thousand pounds!"
he yelled; seizing my arm violently. "You are a brick--Here, cab! cab!" Several drove up--the
shout might have been heard a mile off. He jumped in the first.

"Where to?" said the driver.

"To a tailor's, you rascal!"

"Ten thousand pounds! ha, ha, ha!" he repeated hysterically, when in the cab; and every moment
grasping my arm. Presently he subsided, looked me straight in the face, and muttered with agonizing
fervor, "What a jolly brick you are!"

The tailor, the hosier, the boot-maker, the hair-dresser, were in turn visited by this poor
pagan of externals. As by degrees under their hands he emerged from the beggar to the gentleman,
his spirits rose; his eyes brightened; he walked erect, but always nervously grasping my arm--fearing,
apparently, to lose sight of me for a moment, lest his fortune, should vanish with me. The
impatient pride with which he gave his orders to the astonished tradesman for the finest and
best of everything, and the amazed air of the fashionable hairdresser when he presented his
matted locks and stubble chin, to be "cut and shaved," may be acted--it cannot be described.

By the time the external transformation was complete, and I sat down in a Cafe in the Haymarket
opposite a haggard but handsome thoroughbred-looking man, whose air, with the exception of
the wild eyes and deeply browned face, did not differ from the stereotyped men about town sitting
around us, Mr. Molinos Fitz-Roy had already almost forgotten the past. He bullied the waiter,
and criticised the wine, as if he had done nothing else but dine and drink and scold there
all the days of his life.

Once he wished to drink my health, and would have proclaimed his whole story to the coffee-room
assembly, in a raving style. When I left he almost wept in terror at the idea of losing sight
of me. But, allowing for these ebullitions--the natural result of such a whirl of events--he
was wonderfully calm and self-possessed.

The next day, his first care was to distribute fifty pounds among his friends, the cadgers,
at a "house of call" in Westminster, and formally to dissolve his connection with them; those
present undertaking for the "fraternity," that for the future he should never be noticed by
them in public or private.

I cannot follow his career much further. Adversity had taught him nothing. He was soon again
surrounded by the well-bred vampires who had forgotten him when penniless; but they amused
him, and that was enough. The ten thousand pounds were rapidly melting when he invited me to
a grand dinner at Richmond, which included a dozen of the most agreeable, good-looking, well-dressed
dandies of London, interspersed with a display of pretty butterfly bonnets. We dined deliciously,
and drank as men do of iced wines in the dog-days--looking down from Richmond Hill.

One of the pink-bonnets crowned Fitz-Roy with a wreath of flowers; he looked--less the intellect--as
handsome as Alcibiades. Intensely excited and flushed, he rose with a champagne glass in his
hand to propose my health.

The oratorical powers of his father had not descended on him. Jerking out sentences by spasms,
at length he said, "I was a beggar--I am a gentleman--thanks to this--"

Here he leaned on my shoulder heavily a moment, and then fell back. We raised him, loosened
his neckcloth--

"Fainted!" said the ladies--

"Drunk!" said the gentlemen--

He was dead!

A FASHIONABLE FORGER.

I am an attorney and a bill-discounter. As it is my vocation to lend money at high interest
to extravagant people, my connection principally lies among "fools," sometimes among rogues
"of quality." Mine is a pursuit which a prejudiced world either holds in sovereign contempt,
or visits with envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness; but to my mind, there are many callings,
with finer names, that are no better. It gives me two things which I love--money and power;
but I cannot deny that it brings with it a bad name. The case lies between character and money,
and involves a matter of taste. Some people like character; I prefer money. If I am hated and
despised, I chuckle over the "per contra." I find it pleasant for members of a proud aristocracy
to condescend from their high estate to fawn, feign, flatter; to affect even mirthful familiarity
in order to gain my good-will. I am no Shylock. No client can accuse me of desiring either
his flesh or his blood. Sentimental vengeance is no item in my stock in trade. Gold and bank-notes
satisfy my "rage;" or, if need be, a good mortgage. Far from seeking revenge, the worst defaulter
I ever had dealings with cannot deny that I am always willing to accept a good post-obit.

I say again, I am daily brought in contact with all ranks of society, from the poverty-stricken
patentee to the peer; and I am no more surprised at receiving an application from a duchess
than from a pet opera-dancer. In my ante room wait, at this moment, a crowd of borrowers. Among
the men, (beardless folly and mustachioed craft are most prominent,) there is a handsome young
fellow, with an elaborate cane and wonderfully vacant countenance, who is anticipating in feeble
follies, an estate that has been in the possession of his ancestors since the reign of Henry
the Eighth--there is a hairy, high-nosed, broken-down nondescript, in appearance something
between a horse-dealer and a pugilist. He is an old Etonian. Five years ago he drove his four-in-hand;
he is now waiting to beg a sovereign, having been just discharged from the Insolvent Court,
for the second time. Among the women, a pretty actress, who, a few years since, looked forward
to a supper of steak and onions, with bottled stout, on a Saturday night, as a great treat,
now finds one hundred pounds a month insufficient to pay her wine merchant and her confectioner.
I am obliged to deal with each case according to its peculiarities. Genuine undeserved Ruin
seldom knocks at my doer. Mine is a perpetual battle with people who imbibe trickery at the
same rate as they dissolve their fortunes. I am a hard man, of course. I should not be fit
for my pursuit if I were not; but when, by a remote chance, honest misfortune pays me a visit,
as Rothschilds amused himself at times by giving a beggar a guinea, so I occasionally treat
myself to the luxury of doing a kind action. My favorite subjects for this unnatural generosity,
are the very young or the poor, innocent, helpless people, who are unfit for the war of life.
Many among my clients (especially those tempered in the "ice book" of fashion and high-life--polished
and passionless) would be too much for me, if I had not made the face, the eye, the accent,
as much my study as the mere legal and financial points of discount To show what I mean, I
will relate what happened to me not long since:--

One day, a middle-aged man in the usual costume of a West-End shopman, who had sent in his
name as Mr. Axminster, was shown into my private room. After a little hesitation, he said,
"Although you do not know me, living at this end of the town, I know you very well by reputation,
and that you discount bills. I have a bill here which I want to get discounted. I am in the
employ of Messrs. Russle and Smooth. The bill is drawn by one of our best customers, the Hon.
Miss Snape, niece of Lord Blimley, and accepted by Major Munge, whom, no doubt, you know by
name. She has dealt with us for some years--is very, very extravagant; but always pays." He
put the acceptance--which was for two hundred pounds--into my hands.

I looked at it as scrutinizingly as I usually do at such paper The Major's signature was familiar
to me; but having succeeded to a great estate, he had long ceased to be a customer. I instantly
detected a forgery; by whom?--was the question. Could it be the man before me? Experience told
me it was not. Perhaps there was something in the expression of my countenance which Mr. Axminster
did not like, for he said, "It is good for the amount, I presume?"

I replied, "Pray, sir, from whom did you get this bill?"

"From Miss Snape herself."

"Have you circulated any other bills made by the same drawer?"

"O yes!" said the draper, without hesitation; "I have paid away a bill for one hundred pounds
to Mr. Sparkle, the jeweller, to whom Miss Snape owed twenty pounds. They gave me the difference."

"And how long has that bill to run now?"

"About a fortnight."

"Did you indorse it?"

"I did. Mr. Sparkle required me to do so, to show that the bill came properly into his possession."

"This second bill, you say is urgently required to enable Miss Snape to leave town?"

"Yes; she is going to Brighton for the winter."

I gave Mr. Axminster a steady, piercing look of inquiry. "Pray, sir," I said, "could you meet
that one hundred pounds bill, supposing it could not be paid by the accepter?"

"Meet it!" The poor fellow wiped from his forehead the perspiration which suddenly broke out
at the bare hint of a probability that the bill would be dishonored--"Meet it? O no! I am a
married man, with a family, and have nothing but my salary to depend on."

"Then the sooner you get it taken up, and the less you have to do with Miss Snape's bill affairs,
the better."

"She has always been punctual hitherto."

"That may be." I pointed to the cross-writing on the document, and said deliberately, "This
bill is a forgery!"

At these words the poor man turned pale. He snatched up the document, and with many incoherent
protestations, was rushing toward the door, when I called to him in an authoritative tone,
to stop. He paused--his manner indicating not only doubt, but fear. I said to him, "Don't flurry
yourself; I only want to serve you. You tell me that you are a married man, with children,
dependent on daily labor for daily bread, and that you have done a little discounting for Miss
Snape, out of your earnings. Now, although I am a bill-discounter, I don't like to see such
men victimized. Look at the body of this bill--look at the signature of your lady-customer,
the drawer. Don't you detect the same fine, thin, sharp-pointed handwriting in the words 'Accepted,
Dymmock Munge." The man, convinced against his will, was at first overcome. When he recovered,
he raved; he would expose the Honorable Miss Snape, if it cost him his bread--he would go at
once to the police office. I stopped him, by saying roughly, "Don't be a fool! Any such steps
would seal your ruin. Take my advice; return the bill to the lady, saying, simply, that you
cannot get it discounted. Leave the rest to me, and I think the bill you have indorsed to Sparkle
will be paid." Comforted by this assurance, Axminster, fearfully changed from the nervous,
but smug, hopeful man of the morning, departed. It now remained for me to exert what skill
I possessed, to bring about the desired result. I lost no time in writing a letter to the Honorable
Miss Snape, of which the following is a copy:--

"Madam,--A bill, purporting to be drawn by you, has been offered to me for discount. There
is something wrong about it; and, though a stranger to you, I advise you to lose no time in
getting it back into your own hands.--D.D."

I intended to deal with the affair quietly, and without any view to profit. The fact is, that
I was sorry--you may laugh--but I really was sorry to think that a young girl might have given
way to temptation under pressure of pecuniary difficulties. If it had been a man's case, I
doubt whether I should have interfered. By the return of post, a lady's maid entered my room,
profusely decorated with ringlets, lace, and perfumed with patchouli. She brought a letter
from her mistress. It ran thus:--

"Sir,--I cannot sufficiently express my thanks for your kindness in writing to me on the subject
of the bills, of which I had also heard a few hours previously. As a perfect stranger to you,
I cannot estimate your kind consideration at too high a value. I trust the matter will be explained;
but I should much like to see you. If you would be kind enough to write a note as soon as you
receive this, I will order it to be sent to me at once to Tyburn Square. I will wait on you
at any hour on Friday you may appoint. I believe that I am not mistaken in supposing that you
transact business for my friend, Sir John Markham, and you will therefore know the inclosed
to be his handwriting. Again thanking you most gratefully, allow me to remain your much and
deeply obliged, JULIANA SNAPE."

This note was written upon delicate French paper embossed with a coat of arms. It was in a
fancy envelope--the whole richly perfumed, and redolent of rank and fashion. Its contents were
an implied confession of forgery. Silence, or three lines of indignation, would have been the
only innocent answer to my letter. But Miss Snape thanked me. She let me know, by implication
that she was on intimate terms with a name good on a West-End bill. My answer was, that I should
be alone on the following afternoon at five.

At the hour fixed, punctual to a moment, a brougham drew up at the corner of the street next
to my chambers. The Honorable Miss Snape's card was handed in. Presently, she entered, swimming
into my room, richly, yet simply dressed in the extreme of Parisian good taste. She was pale--or
rather colorless. She had fair hair, fine teeth, and a fashionable voice. She threw herself
gracefully into the chair I handed to her, and began by uncoiling a string of phrases, to the
effect that her visit was merely to consult me on "unavoidable pecuniary difficulties."

According to my mode, I allowed her to talk; putting in only an occasional word of question
that seemed rather a random observation than a significant query. At length after walking round
and round the subject, like a timid horse in a field around a groom with a sieve of oats, she
came nearer and nearer the subject. When she had fairly approached the point, she stopped,
as if her courage had failed her. But she soon recovered, and observed, "I cannot think why
you should take the trouble to write so to me, a perfect stranger." Another pause--"I wonder
no one ever suspected me before."

Here was a confession and a key to character. The cold gray eye, the thin compressed lips,
which I had had time to observe, were true indexes to the "lady's inner heart;" selfish calculating,
utterly devoid of conscience; unable to conceive the existence of spontaneous kindness; utterly
indifferent to anything except discovery, and almost indifferent to that, because convinced
that no serious consequences could affect a lady of her rank and influence.

"Madam," I replied, "as long as you dealt with tradesmen accustomed to depend on aristocratic
customers, your rank and position, and their large profits, protected you from suspicion; but
you have made a mistake in descending from your vantage ground to make a poor shopman your
innocent accomplice--a man who will be keenly alive to anything that may injure his wife or
children. His terrors--but for my interposition--would have ruined you utterly. Tell me, how
many of these things have you put afloat?"

She seemed a little taken a-back by this speech, but was wonderfully firm. She passed her white,
jewelled hand over her eyes, seemed calculating, and then whispered, with a confiding look
of innocent helplessness, admirably assumed, "About as many as amount to twelve hundred pounds."

"And what means have you for meeting them?"

At this question so plainly put, her face flushed. She half rose from her chair, and exclaimed
in the true tone of aristocratic hauteur, "Really, sir, I do not know what right you have to
ask me that question."

I laughed a little, though not very loud. It was rude, I own; but who could have helped it?
I replied, speaking low, but slowly and distinctly--"You forget. I did not send for you; you
came to me. You have forged bills to the amount of twelve hundred pounds. Yours is not the
case of a ruined merchant or an ignorant over-tempted clerk. In your case a jury"--(she shuddered
at that word)--"would find no extenuating circumstances; and if you should fall into the hands
of justice you will be convicted, degraded, clothed in a prison-dress, and transported for
life. I do not want to speak harshly; but I insist that you find means to take up the bill
which Mr. Axminster has so unwittingly endorsed!"

The Honorable Miss Snape's grand manner melted away. She wept. She seized and pressed my hand.
She cast up her eyes, full of tears, and went through the part of a repentant victim with great
fervor. She would do anything--anything in the world to save the poor man. Indeed, she had
intended to appropriate part of the two hundred pound bill to that purpose. She forgot her
first statement, that she wanted the money to go out of town. Without interrupting, I let her
go on and degrade herself by a simulated passion of repentance, regret, and thankfulness to
me, under which she hid her fear and her mortification at being detected. I at length put an
end to a scene of admirable acting, by recommending her to go abroad immediately, to place
herself out of reach of any sudden discovery; and then lay her case fully before her friends,
who would no doubt feel bound to come forward with the full amount of the forged bills. "But,"
she exclaimed, with an entreating air, "I have no money; I cannot go without money!" To that
observation I did not respond although I am sure she expected that I should, check-book in
hand, offer her a loan. I do not say so without reason; for, the very next week, this honorable
young lady came again, and, with sublime assurance and a number of very charming, winning speeches,
(which might have had their effect upon a younger man), asked me to lend her one hundred pounds,
in order that she might take the advice I had so obligingly given her, and retire into private
life for a certain time in the country. I do meet with a great many impudent people in the
course of my calling--I am not very deficient in assurance myself--but this actually took away
my breath.

"Really, madam," I answered, "you pay a very ill-compliment to my gray hairs, and would fain
make me a very ill return for the service I have done you, when you ask me to lend a hundred
pounds to a young lady who owns to having forged to the extent of one thousand two hundred
pounds, and to owing eight hundred pounds besides. I wished to save a personage of your years
and position from a disgraceful career; but I am too good a trustee for my children to lend
money to anybody in such a dangerous position as yourself."

"Oh!" she answered, quite unabashed, without a trace of the fearful, tender pleading of the
previous week's interview--quite as if I had been an accomplice, "I can give you excellent
security."

"That alters the case; I can lend any amount on good security."

"Well, sir, I can get the acceptance of three friends of ample means"

"Do you mean to tell me, Miss Snape, that you will write down the names of three parties who
will accept a bill for one hundred pounds for you?"

Yes, she could, and did actually write down the names of three distinguished men. Now I knew
for certain, that not one of those noblemen would have put his name to a bill on any account
whatever for his dearest friend; but, in her unabashed self-confidence, she thought of passing
another forgery on me. I closed the conference by saying, "I cannot assist you;" and she retired
with the air of an injured person. In the course of a few days, I heard from Mr. Axminster,
that his liability of one hundred pounds had been duly honored.

In my active and exciting life, one day extinguishes the recollection of the events of the
preceding day; and, for a time, I thought no more about the fashionable forger. I had taken
it for granted that, heartily frightened, although not repenting, she had paused in her felonious
pursuits.

My business one day led me to the establishment of one of the most wealthy and respectable
legal firms in the city, where I am well known, and, I believe, valued; for at all times I
am most politely, I may say, most cordially received. Mutual profits create a wonderful freemasonry
between those who have not any other sympathy or sentiment. Politics, religion, morality, difference
of rank, are all equalized and republicanized by the division of an account. No sooner had
I entered the sanctum, than the senior partner, Mr. Precepts, began to quiz his junior, Mr.
Jones, with, "Well, Jones must never joke friend Discount anymore about usury. Just imagine,"
he continued, addressing me, "Jones has himself been discounting a bill for a lady; and a deuced
pretty one too. He sat next her at dinner in Grosvenor Square, last week. Next day she gave
him a call here, and he could not refuse her extraordinary request. Gad, it is hardly fair
for Jones to be poaching on your domains of West-End paper!"

Mr. Jones smiled quietly, as he observed, "Why, you see, she is the niece of one of our best
clients; and really I was so taken by surprise, that I did not know how to refuse."

"Pray," said I, interrupting his excuses, "does your young lady's name begin with S.? Has she
not a very pale face, and cold gray eye?"

The partners stared.

"Ah! I see it is so; and can at once tell you that the bill is not worth a rush."

"Why, you don't mean--?"

"I mean simply that the acceptance is, I'll lay you a wager, a forgery."

"A forgery!"

"A forgery," I repeated as distinctly as possible.

Mr. Jones hastily, and with broken ejaculations, called for the cash-box. With trembling hands
he took out the bill, and followed my finger with eager, watchful eyes, as I pointed out the
proofs of my assertion. A long pause was broken by my mocking laugh; for, at the moment, my
sense of politeness could not restrain my satisfaction at the signal defeat which had attended
the first experiment of these highly respectable gentlemen in the science of usury.

The partners did not have recourse to the police. They did not propose a consultation with
either Mr. Forrester or Mr. Field; but they took certain steps, under my recommendation; the
result of which was that at an early day, an aunt of the Honorable Miss Snape was driven, to
save so near a connection from transportation, to sell out some fourteen hundred pounds of
stock, and all the forgeries were taken up.

One would have thought that the lady who had thus so narrowly escaped, had had enough--but
forgery, like opium-eating, is one of those charming vices which is never abandoned, when once
adopted. The forger enjoys not only the pleasure of obtaining money so easily, but the triumph
of befooling sharp men of the world. Dexterous penmanship is a source of the same sort of pride
as that which animates the skillful rifleman, the practiced duellist, or well-trained billiard-player.
With a clean Gillott he fetches down a capitalist, at three or six months, for a cool hundred
or a round thousand; just as a Scrope drops over a stag at ten, or a Gordon Cumming a monstrous
male elephant at a hundred paces.

As I before observed, my connection especially lies among the improvident--among those who
will be ruined--who are being ruined--and who have been ruined. To the last class belongs Francis
Fisherton, once a gentleman, now without a shilling or a principle; but rich in mother-wit--in
fact, a farceur, after Paul de Kock's own heart. Having in by-gone days been one of my willing
victims, he occasionally finds pleasure and profit in guiding others through the gate he frequented,
as long as able to pay the tolls. In truth, he is what is called a "discount agent."

One day I received a note from him, to say that he would call on me at three o'clock the next
day to introduce a lady of family, who wanted a bill "done" for one hundred pounds. So ordinary
a transaction merely needed a memorandum in my diary, "Tuesday, 3 p.m.; F.F., £100 Bill." The
hour came and passed; but no Frank, which was strange--because every one must have observed,
that, however dilatory people are in paying, they are wonderfully punctual when they expect
to receive money.

At five o'clock, in rushed my Jackall. His story, disentangled from oaths and ejaculations,
amounted to this:--In answer to one of the advertisements he occasionally addresses "To the
Embarrassed," in the columns of the "Times," he received a note from a lady, who said she was
anxious to get a "bill done"--the acceptance of a well-known man of rank and fashion. A correspondence
was opened, and an appointment made. At the hour fixed, neatly shaved, brushed, gloved, booted--the
revival, in short, of that high-bred Frank Fisherton who was so famous

"In his hot youth, when Crockford's was the thing."

glowing with only one glass of brandy, "just to steady his nerves," he met the lady at a West-End
pastry-cook's.

After a few words (for all the material questions had been settled by correspondence) she stepped
into a brougham, and invited Frank to take a seat beside her. Elated with a compliment of late
years so rare, he commenced planning the orgies which were to reward him for weeks of enforced
fasting, when the coachman, reverentially touching his hat, looked down from his seat for orders.

"To ninety-nine, George Street, St. James," cried Fisherton, in his loudest tones.

In an instant the young lady's pale face changed to scarlet, and then to ghastly green. In
a whisper, rising to a scream, she exclaimed, "Good heavens! you do not mean to go to that
man's house," (meaning me.) "Indeed, I cannot go to him, on any account; he is a most horrid
man, I am told, and charges most extravagantly."

"Madam," answered Frank, in great perturbation, "I beg your pardon, but you have been grossly
misinformed. I have known that excellent man these twenty years, and have paid him hundreds
on hundreds; but never so much by ten per cent. as you offered me for discounting your bill."

"Sir, I cannot have anything to do with your friend." Then, violently, pulling the check-string,
"Stop," she gasped, "and will you have the goodness to get out?"

"And so I got out," continued Fisherton, "and lost my time; and the heavy investment I made
in getting myself up for the assignation--new primrose gloves, and a shilling to the hair-dresser--hang
her! But, did you ever know anything like the prejudices that must prevail against you? I am
disgusted with human nature. Could you lend me half a sovereign till Saturday?"

I smiled. I sacrificed the half sovereign, and let him go, for he is not exactly the person
to whom it was advisable to intrust all the secrets relating to the Honorable Miss Snape. Since
that day I look each morning in the police reports with considerable interest; but, up to the
present hour, the Honorable Miss Snape has lived and thrived in the best society.

THE YOUNG ADVOCATE.

Antoine de Chaulieu was the son of a poor gentleman of Normandy, with a long genealogy, a short
rent-roll, and a large family. Jacques Rollet was the son of a brewer, who did not know who
his grandfather was; but he had a long purse and only two children. As these youths flourished
in the early days of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and were near neighbors, they naturally
hated each other. Their enmity commenced at school, where the delicate and refined De Chaulieu,
being the only gentilhomme among the scholars, was the favorite of the master, (who was a bit
of an aristocrat in his heart,) although he was about the worst dressed boy in the establishment,
and never had a sou to spend; while Jacques Rollet, sturdy and rough, with smart clothes and
plenty of money, got flogged six days in the week, ostensibly for being stupid and not learning
his lessons,--which, indeed, he did not,--but, in reality, for constantly quarrelling with
and insulting De Chaulieu, who had not strength to cope with him. When they left the academy,
the feud continued in all its vigor, and was fostered by a thousand little circumstances arising
out of the state of the times, till a separation ensued in consequence of an aunt of Antoine
de Chaulieu's undertaking the expense of sending him to Paris to study the law, and of maintaining
him there during the necessary period.

With the progress of events came some degree of reaction in favor of birth and nobility, and
then Antoine, who had passed for the bar, began to hold up his head and endeavored to push
his fortunes; but fate seemed against him. He felt certain that if he possessed any gift in
the world it was that of eloquence, but he could get no cause to plead; and his aunt dying
inopportunely, first his resources failed, and then his health. He had no sooner returned to
his home, than, to complicate his difficulties completely, he fell in love with Mademoiselle
Natalie de Bellefonds, who had just returned from Paris, where she had been completing her
education. To expatiate on the perfections of Mademoiselle Natalie would be a waste of ink
and paper; it is sufficient to say that she really was a very charming girl, with a fortune
which, though not large, would have been a most desirable acquisition to De Chaulieu, who had
nothing. Neither was the fair Natalie indisposed to listen to his addresses; but her father
could not be expected to countenance the suit of a gentleman, however well born, who had not
a ten-sous piece in the world, and whose prospects were a blank.

While the ambitious and lovesick young barrister was thus pining in unwelcome obscurity, his
old acquaintance, Jacques Rollet, had been acquiring an undesirable notoriety. There was nothing
really bad in Jacques' disposition, but having been bred up a democrat, with a hatred of the
nobility, he could not easily accommodate his rough humor to treat them with civility when
it was no longer safe to insult them. The liberties he allowed himself whenever circumstances
brought him into contact with the higher classes of society, had led him into many scrapes,
out of which his father's money had one way or another released him; but that source of safety
had now failed. Old Rollet, having been too busy with the affairs of the nation to attend to
his business, had died insolvent, leaving his son with nothing but his own wits to help him
out of future difficulties, and it was not long before their exercise was called for. Claudine
Rollet, his sister, who was a very pretty girl, had attracted the attention of Mademoiselle
de Bellefonds' brother, Alphonse; and as he paid her more attention than from such a quarter
was agreeable to Jacques, the young men had more than one quarrel on the subject, on which
occasions they had each, characteristically, given vent to their enmity, the one in contemptuous
monosyllables, and the other in a volley of insulting words. But Claudine had another lover
more nearly of her own condition of life; this was Claperon, the deputy-governor of the Rouen
jail, with whom she made acquaintance during one or two compulsory visits paid by her brother
to that functionary; but Claudine, who was a bit of a coquette, though she did not altogether
reject his suit, gave him little encouragement, so that betwixt hopes and fears, and doubts
and jealousies, poor Claperon led a very uneasy kind of life.

Affairs had been for some time in this position, when, one fine morning, Alphonse de Bellefonds
was not to be found in his chamber when his servant went to call him; neither had his bed been
slept in. He had been observed to go out rather late on the preceding evening, but whether
or not he had returned, nobody could tell. He had not appeared at supper, but that was too
ordinary an event to awaken suspicion; and little alarm was excited till several hours had
elapsed, when inquiries were instituted and a search commenced, which terminated in the discovery
of his body, a good deal mangled, lying at the bottom of a pond which had belonged to the old
brewery. Before any investigations had been made, every person had jumped to the conclusion
that the young man had been murdered, and that Jacques Rollet was the assassin. There was a
strong presumption in favor of that opinion, which further perquisitions tended to confirm.
Only the day before, Jacques had been heard to threaten M. de Bellefonds with speedy vengeance.
On the fatal evening, Alphonse and Claudine had been seen together in the neighborhood of the
now dismantled brewery; and as Jacques, betwixt poverty and democracy, was in bad odor with
the prudent and respectable part of society, it was not easy for him to bring witnesses to
character, or prove an unexceptionable alibi. As for the Bellefonds and De Chaulieus, and the
aristocracy in general, they entertained no doubt of his guilt; and finally, the magistrates
coming to the same opinion, Jacques Rollet was committed for trial, and as a testimony of good
will Antoine de Chaulieu was selected by the injured family to conduct the prosecution.

Here, at last, was the opportunity he had sighed for! So interesting a case, too, furnishing
such ample occasion for passion, pathos, indignation! And how eminently fortunate that the
speech which he set himself with ardor to prepare, would be delivered in the presence of the
father and brother of his mistress, and perhaps of the lady herself! The evidence against Jacques,
it is true, was altogether presumptive; there was no proof whatever that he had committed the
crime; and for his own part he stoutly denied it. But Antoine de Chaulieu entertained no doubt
of his guilt, and his speech was certainly well calculated to carry conviction into the bosom
of others. It was of the highest importance to his own reputation that he should procure a
verdict, and he confidently assured the afflicted and enraged family of the victim that their
vengeance should be satisfied. Under these circumstances could any thing be more unwelcome
than a piece of intelligence that was privately conveyed to him late on the evening before
the trial was to come on, which tended strongly to exculpate the prisoner, without indicating
any other person as the criminal? Here was an opportunity lost. The first step of the ladder
on which he was to rise to fame, fortune, and a wife, was slipping from under his feet!

Of course, so interesting a trial was anticipated with great eagerness by the public, and the
court was crowded with all the beauty and fashion of Rouen. Though Jacques Rollet persisted
in asserting his innocence, founding his defence chiefly on circumstances which were strongly
corroborated by the information that had reached De Chaulieu the preceding evening, he was
convicted.

In spite of the very strong doubts he privately entertained respecting the justice of the verdict,
even De Chaulieu himself, in the first flush of success, amid a crowd of congratulating friends,
and the approving smiles of his mistress, felt gratified and happy; his speech had, for the
time being, not only convinced others, but himself; warmed with his own eloquence, he believed
what he said. But when the glow was over, and he found himself alone, he did not feel so comfortable.
A latent doubt of Rollet's guilt now burnt strongly in his mind, and he felt that the blood
of the innocent would be on his head. It is true there was yet time to save the life of the
prisoner; but to admit Jacques innocent was to take the glory out of his own speech, and turn
the sting of his argument against himself. Besides, if he produced the witness who had secretly
given him the information, he should be self-condemned, for he could not conceal that he had
been aware of the circumstance before the trial.

Matters having gone so far, therefore, it was necessary that Jacques Rollet should die; so
the affair took its course; and early one morning the guillotine was erected in the courtyard
of the jail, three criminals ascended the scaffold, and three heads fell into the basket which
were presently afterwards, with the trunks that had been attached to them, buried in a corner
of the cemetery.

Antoine de Chaulieu was now fairly started in his career, and his success was as rapid as the
first step towards it had been tardy. He took a pretty apartment in the Hotel de Marboeuf Rue
Grange-Batelière, and in a short time was looked upon as one of the most rising young advocates
in Paris. His success in one line brought him success in another; he was soon a favorite in
society, and an object of interest to speculating mothers; but his affections still adhered
to his old love, Natalie de Bellefonds, whose family now gave their assent to the match,--at
least, prospectively,--a circumstance which furnished such an additional incentive to his exertions,
that in about two years from the date of his first brilliant speech, he was in a sufficiently
flourishing condition to offer the young lady a suitable home. In anticipation of the happy
event, he engaged and furnished a suit of apartments in the Rue du Helder; and as it was necessary
that the bride should come to Paris to provide her trousseau, it was agreed that the wedding
should take place there, instead of at Bellefonds, as had been first projected--an arrangement
the more desirable, that a press of business rendered M. de Chaulieu's absence from Paris inconvenient.

Brides and bridegrooms in France, except of the very high classes, are not much in the habit
of making those honeymoon excursions so universal in this country. A day spent in visiting
Versailles, or St. Cloud, or even the public places of the city, is generally all that precedes
the settling down into the habits of daily life. In the present instance, St. Denis was selected,
from the circumstance of Natalie having a younger sister at school there, and also because
she had a particular desire to see the abbey.

The wedding was to take place on a Thursday; and on the Wednesday evening, having spent some
hours most agreeably with Natalie, Antoine de Chaulieu returned to spend his last night in
his bachelor apartments. His wardrobe and other small possessions had already been packed up
and sent to his future home; and there was nothing left in his room now but his new wedding
suit, which he inspected with considerable satisfaction before he undressed and lay down to
sleep. Sleep, however, was somewhat slow to visit him; and the clock had struck one before
he closed his eyes. When he opened them again, it was broad daylight; and his first thought
was, had he overslept himself? He sat up in bed to look at the clock, which was exactly opposite;
and as he did so, in the large mirror over the fireplace he perceived a figure standing behind
him. As the dilated eyes met his own, he saw it was the face of Jacques Rollet. Overcome with
horror, he sank back on his pillow, and it was some minutes before he ventured to look again
in that direction; when he did so, the figure had disappeared.

The sudden revulsion of feeling such a vision was calculated to occasion in a man elate with
joy, may be conceived. For some time after the death of his former foe, he had been visited
by not unfrequent twinges of conscience; but of late, borne along by success, and the hurry
of Parisian life, these unpleasant remembrances had grown rarer, till at length they had faded
away altogether. Nothing had been further from his thoughts than Jacques Rollet, when he closed
his eyes on the preceding night, nor when he opened them to that sun which was to shine on
what he expected to be the happiest day of his life. Where were the high-strung nerves now?
the elastic frame? the bounding heart?

Heavily and slowly he arose from his bed, for it was time to do so; and with a trembling hand
and quivering knees, he went through the processes of the toilet, gashing his cheek with the
razor, and spilling the water over his well-polished boots. When he was dressed, scarcely venturing
to cast a glance in the mirror as he passed it, he quitted the room, and descended the stairs,
taking the key of the door with him for the purpose of leaving it with the porter: the man,
however, being absent, he laid it on the table in his lodge, and with a relaxed and languid
step proceeded on his way to the church, where presently arrived the fair Natalie and her friends.
How difficult it was now to look happy with that pallid face and extinguished eye!

"How pale you are! Has any thing happened? You are surely ill," were the exclamations that
met him on all sides. He tried to carry it off as well as he could, but felt that the movements
he would have wished to appear alert were only convulsive, and that the smiles with which he
attempted to relax his features were but distorted grimaces. However, the church was not the
place for further inquiries; and while Natalie gently pressed his hand in token of sympathy,
they advanced to the altar, and the ceremony was performed; after which they stepped into the
carriages waiting at the door, and drove to the apartments of Madame de Bellefonds, where an
elegant déjeuner was prepared.

"What ails you, my dear husband?" inquired Natalie, as soon as they were alone.

"Nothing, love," he replied; "nothing, I assure you, but a restless night and a little overwork,
in order that I might have to-day free to enjoy my happiness."

"Are you quite sure? Is there nothing else?"

"Nothing, indeed; and pray don't take notice of it; it only makes me worse."

Natalie was not deceived, but she saw that what he said was true; notice made him worse; so
she contented herself with observing him quietly, and saying nothing; but, as he felt she was
observing him, she might almost better have spoken; words are often less embarrassing things
than too curious eyes.

When they reached Madame de Bellefond's he had the same sort of questioning and scrutiny to
undergo, till he grew quite impatient under it, and betrayed a degree of temper altogether
unusual with him. Then every body looked astonished; some whispered their remarks, and others
expressed them by their wondering eyes, till his brow knit, and his pallid cheeks became flushed
with anger. Neither could he divert attention by eating; his parched mouth would not allow
him to swallow any thing but liquids, of which, however, he indulged in copious libations;
and it was an exceeding relief to him when the carriage, which was to convey them to St. Denis,
being announced, furnished an excuse for hastily leaving the table. Looking at his watch, he
declared it was late; and Natalie, who saw how eager he was to be gone, threw her shawl over
her shoulders, and bidding her friends good morning, they hurried away.

It was a fine sunny day in June; and as they drove along the crowded boulevards, and through
the Porte St. Denis, the young bride and bridegroom, to avoid each other's eyes, affected to
be gazing out of the windows; but when they reached the part of the road where there was nothing
but trees on each side, they felt it necessary to draw in their heads, and make an attempt
at conversation, De Chaulieu put his arm round his wife's waist, and tried to rouse himself
from his depression; but it had by this time so reacted upon her, that she could not respond
to his efforts, and thus the conversation languished, till both felt glad when they reached
their destination, which would, at all events, furnish them something to talk about.

Having quitted the carriage, and ordered a dinner at the Hotel de l'Abbaye, the young couple
proceeded to visit Mademoiselle Hortense de Bellefonds, who was overjoyed to see her sister
and new brother-in-law, and doubly so when she found that they had obtained permission to take
her out to spend the afternoon with them. As there is little to be seen at St. Denis but the
Abbey, on quitting that part of it devoted to education, they proceeded to visit the church,
with its various objects of interest; and as De Chaulieu's thoughts were now forced into another
direction, his cheerfulness began insensibly to return. Natalie looked so beautiful, too, and
the affection betwixt the two young sisters was so pleasant to behold! Don there to damper, of illuminance

 It was not the easiest thing in the world to re-assure a woman whose
pride, affection, and taste, had been so severely wounded; but Natalie tried to believe, or
to appear to do so, and a sort of reconciliation ensued, not quite sincere on the part of the
wife, and very humbling on the part of the husband. Under these circumstances it was impossible
that he should recover his spirits or facility of manner; his gaiety was forced, his tenderness
constrained; his heart was heavy within him; and ever and anon the source whence all this disappointment
and woe had sprung would recur to his perplexed and tortured mind.

Thus mutually pained and distrustful, they returned to Paris, which they reached about nine
o'clock. In spite of her depression, Natalie, who had not seen her new apartments, felt some
curiosity about them, whilst De Chaulieu anticipated a triumph in exhibiting the elegant home
he had prepared for her. With some alacrity, therefore, they stepped out of the carriage, the
gates of the Hotel were thrown open, the concierge rang the bell which announced to the servants
that their master and mistress had arrived, and whilst these domestics appeared above, holding
lights over the balustrades, Natalie, followed by her husband, ascended the stairs. But when
they reached the landing-place of the first flight, they saw the figure of a man standing in
a corner as if to make way for them; the flash from above fell upon his face, and again Antoine
de Chaulieu recognized the features of Jacques Rollet!

From the circumstance of his wife's preceding him, the figure was not observed by De Chaulieu
till he was lifting his foot to place it on the top stair: the sudden shock caused him to miss
the step, and, without uttering a sound, he fell back, and never stopped till he reached the
stones at the bottom. The screams of Natalie brought the concierge from below and the maids
from above, and an attempt was made to raise the unfortunate man from the ground; but with
cries of anguish he besought them to desist.

"Let me," he said, "die here! What a fearful vengeance is thine! O, Natalie, Natalie!" he exclaimed
to his wife, who was kneeling beside him, "to win fame, and fortune, and yourself, I committed
a dreadful crime! With lying words I argued away the life of a fellow-creature, whom, whilst
I uttered them, I half believed to be innocent; and now, when I have attained all I desired,
and reached the summit of my hopes, the Almighty has sent him back upon the earth to blast
me with the sight. Three times this day--three times this day! Again! again!"--and as he spoke,
his wild and dilated eyes fixed themselves on one of the individuals that surrounded him.

"He is delirious," said they.

"No," said the stranger! "What he says is true enough,--at least in part;" and bending over
the expiring man, he added, "May Heaven forgive you, Antoine de Chaulieu! I was not executed;
one who well knew my innocence saved my life. I may name him, for he is beyond the reach of
the law now,--it was Claperon, the jailor, who loved Claudine, and had himself killed Alphonse
de Bellefonds from jealousy. An unfortunate wretch had been several years in the jail for a
murder committed during the frenzy of a fit of insanity. Long confinement had reduced him to
idiocy. To save my life Claperon substituted the senseless being for me, on the scaffold; he
was executed in my stead. He has quitted the country, and I have been a vagabond on the face
of the earth ever since that time. At length I obtained, through the assistance of my sister,
the situation of concierge in the Hotel Marboeuf, in the Rue Grange-Batelière. I entered on
my new place yesterday evening, and was desired to awaken the gentleman on the third floor
at seven o'clock. When I entered the room to do so, you were asleep, but before I had time
to speak you awoke, and I recognized your features in the glass. Knowing that I could not vindicate
my innocence if you chose to seize me, I fled, and seeing an omnibus starting for St. Denis,
I got on it with a vague idea of getting on to Calais, and crossing the Channel to England.
But having only a franc or two in my pocket, or indeed in the world, I did not know how to
procure the means of going forward; and whilst I was lounging about the place, forming first
one plan and then another, I saw you in the church, and concluding you were in pursuit of me,
I thought the best way of eluding your vigilance was to make my way back to Paris as fast as
I could; so I set off instantly, and walked all the way; but having no money to pay my night's
lodging, I came here to borrow a couple of livres of my sister Claudine, who lives in the fifth
story."

"Thank Heaven!" exclaimed the dying man; "that sin is off my soul! Natalie, dear wife, farewell!
Forgive, forgive all!"

These were the last words he uttered; the priest, who had been summoned in haste, held up the
cross before his failing sight; a few strong convulsions shook the poor bruised and mangled
frame; and then all was still.

And thus ended the Young Advocate's Wedding Day.

A MURDER IN THE TIME OF THE CRUSADES.

There is, perhaps, no country or climate more beautiful than England, as seen in one of its
rural landscapes, when the sun has just risen upon a cloudless summer's dawn. The very feeling
that the delightful freshness of the moment will not be entirely destroyed during the whole
day, renders the prospect more agreeable than the anticipated fiery advance of the sun in southern
or tropical lands. Exhilaration and gladness are the marked characteristics of an English summer
morning. So it ever is, and so it was hundreds of years ago, when occurred the events we are
about to narrate. How lovely then, on such a morning as we allude to, looked that rich vale
in the centre of Gloucestershire, through which the lordly Severn flows! The singing of the
birds, the reflective splendor of the silvery waters, the glittering of the dew as it dazzled
and disappeared--all combined to charm sound, sight, and sense, and to produce a strong feeling
of joy. But the horseman, who was passing through this graceful scene, scarcely needed the
aid of any external object to enhance the pleasurable sensation that already filled his breast.
The stately horse on which he sat, seemed, by its light steps, and by ever and anon proudly
prancing, to share in the animation of its rider. So, the noble stag-hound that followed, and
continually looked up contentedly at its master, appeared, likewise, a participator in the
general content. The stranger had indeed cause to rejoice, for he was upon the fairest errand.
He bad wooed and won the gentle heiress of a proud, but good-hearted Gloucestershire baron--he
had wooed and won her, too, with the full consent of father, kinsmen, and friends, and he was
now on his way to the baron's castle to arrange with his betrothed the ceremonial of the nuptials.
Ride on, thou gallant knight, ride on, and swifter too; for though the day will be yet early
when thou arrivest, thou wilt find thyself expected within the Gothic enciente of the Baron
de Botetourt's dwelling. A banner waves from the topmost tower to do thee honor and welcome;
there walks, too, by the battlements, one whose night has been sleepless because of thee, whose
thoughts and whose whole existence centre in thee, whose look firmly attaches to the road that
brings thee to her. Ride on then speedily, Sir Knight, to the happiness thy virtue and thy
deeds have so well deserved.

This lover is no ordinary suitor: he is of mingled Saxon and Norman noble blood, the recent
companion-in-arms of Richard Coeur de Lion. His name is Ralph de Sudley, and though he has
passed his thirtieth year, the effect of long toil and war scarcely appears upon his handsome
and still very youthful countenance. Yet the knight has seen and endured much: he has been
with Richard at the siege and capture of Acre, and at the battle of Azotus. When Conrad of
Montferrat fell by the dagger of the assassins, Sir Ralph took a prominent part in the stormy
debates which ensued among the Crusaders. He even proposed with his men-at-arms, and those
who would follow him, to invade the territory of the Lord of the Mountain, and to avenge in
his blood the death which that king of murderers had caused to be done to Conrad. This event
made so deep an impression on his mind, that he still took every opportunity of urging upon
his own and other Christian governments the necessity of extirpating these eastern assassins.
On his return from the crusades, Sir Ralph found the daughter of his friend, the Baron de Botetourt,
just verging into beauteous womanhood. The glory of his reputation, and the graces of his person,
gained her heart at once; the Lady Alianore, though much his junior in years, loved the knight
fondly and devotedly.

Sir Ralph has reached the portcullis of the castle; the wardour and men-at-arms are there to
receive him with full honors, though he comes privately, without his armor or his followers:
he wears the civil but costly dress of the period, with no other weapon than a slight sword
at his side. But the baron will have each advent of his future son-in-law welcomed as an approach
of state.

"Grammercy, Sir Baron," observed the knight, as after passing through a crowd of domestics,
he grasped his host's hand upon the threshold, "one would imagine me Richard of England himself,
or rather Saladin, that greatest and most gaudy of Oriental Soldans, to see this pompous prelude
to my disjune with your lovely daughter and yourself."

"Nay, Ralph de Sudley," replied the baron, "my castle must needs put on its best looks, when
it beholds the entry of one who is to be its lord and protector when I shall be no more. But
I see you are all impatience to go within; and, in truth, the sooner your first interview be
over the better, for the table is prepared, and the pasty awaits us, and the chaplain too,
whose inward man, after the morning's Mass, craves some solid refreshment."

"A moment, my worthiest of friends, and I am with you," said the knight, as he hurried by:
in another instant the Lady Alianore was in his embrace. Need we repeat the oft-told tale of
love? Need we describe the day of delight Sir Ralph passed in the castle, lingering from hour
to hour until the dusk? O, there is some one we must depict, the lady herself, who so subdued
and softened this knightly soul. There, one hand upon the shoulder of her lover, her other
hand locked in his, she sits listening to his words, and luxuriating in his discourse. The
Lady Alianore, somewhat tall in stature, but perfect in form, has a face of dazzling beauty,
yet the bewitching sweetness of her smile is tempered by a certain dignity of countenance,
to which her dark, raven hair, and darker eyes, do not a little contribute; her hands, and
the foot that peeps from beneath, her graceful robe, are of exquisite smallness, and bespeak
the purest Norman blood. Her extreme fairness, shaded by her sable locks, form a strong contrast
to the auburn hair and ruddy visage of the stalwart warrior beside her.

"This will indeed be too much, Ralph," observed the lady; "a monarch, his queen, and his court,
to come to this out-of-the-way castle, to honor the wedding of a lone damsel like myself; I
can hardly support the idea of so much splendor."

"Fear not, my beloved," replied the knight, "Richard is homely enough, and all good nature.
Moreover, it is but a return of civility; for I it was who accompanied him to the altar, where
he obtained the hand of Berengaria of Navarre; the office was a dangerous one then, since I
incurred by it the wrath of Philip of France. And why, dearest, should not every magnificence
attend our nuptials? It is the outward emblem of our great content--a mark, like those gorgeous
ceremonies that accompany the festive prayers of the Church, which tell the people of the earth
of a joy having something of the gladness and glory of Heaven in it."

"Be it as you wish, my own true knight; yet I almost feel that I am too happy. May God bless
and protect us!"

Thus passed this bright day, until the approach of dusk imperatively compelled the enraptured
lovers to separate. The knight had urgent business to settle, early on the morrow, at his own
castle, before setting out for London, to announce to the king the day fixed for the espousal,
and to beg from the monarch the fulfilment of the promise he had made, to be present in person
with his court, at the wedding of his gallant and faithful vassal. The knight was therefore
forced to depart ere the gloom advanced; for though his journey lay in a friendly and peaceful
country, it was not the habit in those days to be abroad much after dusk, without an efficient
escort.

Sir Ralph reluctantly quitted his betrothed: he made his escape moreover from the baron and
the chaplain, who prayed his further tarrying, to share in another flagon of Rhenish about
to be produced. The horse and dog were at the porch, and, in a few minutes, the knight had
passed the drawbridge, and was in the same fair road again.

"I have known Sir Ralph from his birth," observed the baron to the chaplain, "and I love him
as my own son. The king may well come here to see him wedded; for he has not a nobler, braver,
or more generous knight within his realm."

"Truly, Sir Baron, he is endowed with much excellence," replied the priest; "I do greatly admire
his strong denunciation against the Templars and other warlike orders, who tolerate the protracted
existence of that band of murderers in the past who have their daggers ever pointed against
the sons of the Church. Sir Ralph speaks on this subject like a true soldier of the Cross."

"Very true," retorted the baron, "yet I wish our chevaliers would cease to think of foreign
broils and questions, and attend to affairs at home. This Rhenish is perfect: after all, wine
is the only thing really good that originates beyond our seas."

Their discourse had scarcely proceeded farther, when it was suddenly interrupted by the loud
howling and barking of a dog. The baron and the chaplain started up. "It is Leo, Sir Ralph's
dog," exclaimed the former, "what in God's name can be the matter?" and the two rushed out.

The Lady Alianore, at her orisons above, heard the same terrible howl and bark. She instantly
descended to the courtyard; as she came there, the outer gate was opened, and Leo, the knight's
dog, flew past the wardour, and ran to the feet of the lady. The animal's mouth was blood-stained,
and his glaring eye-balls and ruffled crest showed the extent of his fury and despair.

"Something dreadful has happened to Sir Ralph," she cried, and urged by the dog, who had seized
her robe, she hurried through the gate, and crossed the drawbridge, with a rapidity those who
followed could not arrest.

When the baron, his chaplain, and his domestics had proceeded a little beyond a quarter of
a mile upon the road, a fearful sight met their view.

The knight lay dead upon the green sward by the side of the highway; a poignard which had effected
the mortal wound, still rested fixed into his back. His body was locked fast in the embrace
of the Lady Alianore, who lay senseless upon it: the dog stood by, howling piteously. No trace
could be discovered of who had done the deed. No proof was there beyond the dagger itself,
which was of Oriental fashion, and bore the inscription in Latin Hoc propter verba tua; naught
beyond that and another circumstance, which went to show that the knight had been slain by
an eastern enemy. The dog, as he re-entered the castle, called attention to some pieces of
blood-stained rag, which, from their appearance, had dropped from his mouth; one of these,
the innermost, was in texture and pattern evidently part of a Syrian garment.

The Lady Alianore did not die under this dreadful calamity: she lived to mourn. The knight
was interred within the precinct of the Abbey Church of Gloucester; his tomb and effigy were
in a niche at an angle of the cloisters. Here would Alianore continually come, accompanied
by Leo, who, since his master's death, never left her side; here would she stop, fixedly gazing
upon the monument, the tear in her eye, and the chill of hopeless sorrow in her heart. There
are, indeed, few of us, who, wandering through the interior of some noble ecclesiastical edifice,
can suppress a feeling of melancholy, when we view the sepulchre of a knight of repute, who
has died in his prime, in the midst of his achievements and his fame, and who, clad in the
harness of his pride, lies outstretched in the marble before us. Courage and courtesy, chivalry
and Christianity, are buried there--there the breast, replete with honor, the heart to feel,
and the right arm to defend. The monument tells of the sudden extinguishment of some bright
light that shone in a semi-barbarous age, which had its main civilization and refinement from
knights and churchmen solely. If this sight would sadden a stranger soul, what must have been
the deep grief of the lady as she contemplated the cold memorial of Sir Ralph, and felt that
the consummation of her whole earthly comfort was there entombed! A secret sentiment that satisfied,
or rather softened her mental agony, brought her again and again to the place--ay, again and
again to gaze upon the grave, and then to retire into the church to long and ardent prayer.

About two years after the knight had been dead, the Lady Alianore was one morning departing
through the cloisters from a visit to the tomb, when her attention was suddenly arrested by
a low growl from the dog who accompanied her. She turned back, and saw two persons in the garb
of foreign merchants or traders, the one pointing out to the other the knight's monumental
effigy. Scarcely had she made the observation, when Leo rushed from her side, and flew at the
throat of him who was exhibiting the grave; in an instant he brought him to the ground; the
other endeavored to escape, but some sacristans who heard the noise, hastened to the spot,
and the men were arrested.

On examination, the two pretended merchants were found to wear eastern habilaments beneath
their long gowns, and the cloth of the turban was concealed under the broad brimmed hat of
each. They both had daggers, and upon the arm of the one the dog had seized, there was the
deep scar of what seemed to be a desperate bite. Further proof became needless, for when every
chance of escape was gone, they made a full confession, and appeared to glory in it. They were
emissaries from the Old Man of the Mountain. The one on a previous occasion had journeyed from
the far east to do his fearful master's bidding, and had stabbed the knight in the back, on
the evening he rode in his gladness from the abode of his affianced bride. The fanatic himself
narrowly escaped destruction at the time; for the dog had fixed his teeth into his arm, and
it was only by allowing the flesh to be torn out, (his dagger was in his victim,) that he contrived
to reach a swift Arabian horse, which bore him from the scene. He had since returned to Phoenicia,
and had once more come to England, bringing with him a comrade to remove a doubt expressed
by his master, and to testify to the monarch of the Mountain how effectively his object had
been accomplished.

The Baron de Botetourt, with the assent of the crown, caused the two miscreants to be hanged
upon a gibbet on the summit of his castle, their turbans tied to their heels. Leo, as if he
had nothing more to live for, soon after pined and died. The Lady Alianore, retired into a
convent, and eventually became its abbess. And that him was a very or ghastly angel, one of people,
or the soul to him who saw they, if had discovered she, and nothing of end it was done, and i leave
to anger the examination of others. Bad many lamentations as credit
who hid and had of the coin to this day. On her death-bed,
she requested that her remains might be interred in the Abbey of Gloucester, nigh unto the
tomb of Sir Ralph de Sudley, and that her monumental tablet should contain no more than her
name and state, and an inscription pointing out the extreme vanity of all human felicity. Such
a memorial, it is said, was, until entirely effaced by time, to be seen, read, and thought
upon, within the cloisters of Gloucester's time-honored and sanctified cathedral.
