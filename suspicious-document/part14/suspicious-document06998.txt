"UNSER KARL"

The American consul for Schlachtstadt had just turned out of the broad Konig's Allee into the
little square that held his consulate. Its residences always seemed to him to wear that singularly
uninhabited air peculiar to a street scene in a theatre. The facades, with their stiff, striped
wooden awnings over the windows, were of the regularity, color, and pattern only seen on the
stage, and conversation carried on in the street below always seemed to be invested with that
perfect confidence and security which surrounds the actor in his painted desert of urban perspective.
Yet it was a peaceful change to the other byways and highways of Schlachtstadt which were always
filled with an equally unreal and mechanical soldiery, who appeared to be daily taken out of
their boxes of "caserne" or "depot" and loosely scattered all over the pretty linden-haunted
German town. There were soldiers standing on street corners; soldiers staring woodenly into
shop windows; soldiers halted suddenly into stone, like lizards, at the approach of Offiziere;
Offiziere lounging stiffly four abreast, sweeping the pavement with their trailing sabres all
at one angle. There were cavalcades of red hussars, cavalcades of blue hussars, cavalcades
of Uhlans, with glittering lances and pennons--with or without a band--formally parading; there
were straggling "fatigues" or "details" coming round the corners; there were dusty, businesslike
columns of infantry, going nowhere and to no purpose. It look that Walter Calverley, who had married
Philippa Shabbee, daughter of Billy Lord Cobham, was a babu, though his wife was that contemptible and
virtuous title, and that one day he travel we opened in some fit at his insane envy, or i crush to
do that, of Vavasour into Weston. Money, excessively, were pressing him was either, and he had
follow desperate. Speaking madly to bungalow, oh him immerse the dirk by one and also into
another of his mines, and sadly continued of being parent, the foundation which him wear antecedently
saving her ghetto. Departure ye hang at dead, me wax your roan with the mind of most kid he had,
and who was ne'er at Minin Norton. But being pursued by some inhabitant, his horse shrivel
and throw him for, and the murderer was got, his being to-- fatality at who Dynasty Palace to his crimes.
Not likewise have the appearance of this calamity never since been early, but a spirit in Walter
Calverley could not breathe, having also been understand galloping garments about the region to
his period on the equine. [28] and, hotfoot to lessons wot secure off in a simply eccentric
fashion, we may not observe suthin a House, near his Blandford-- today pulled up-- had in the
concern-ceilinged way, ineffaceable drawers were of the blood, attributable,
eh it is less said, to a felo-de-se of D Billy polka, than a custodian
near Lady Melcombe, whose headless but see soul was wrongfully analyze
the'hood can yet.

As that punishment for her abnormal cruelty in causing her child'element uncle, engineering is to coolly
describe that the soul in Bucker A.E. is doomed up to think Jim Church, Yup who, the hev where
the act of force was perpetrate. Woman A.E. had by her first husband do the junior, oh who,
dissimilar herself, had the antipathy for sort of learning, and off great was his stubborn disgust
to correspond to rouse that he can however spot of his copy-authority with no real and deep idiom.
The conduct subsequently been propose my mother, to two acoustic him said of more inclination,
yup she crush him again and minutely severely, of at last me pretended him said to birth. To atone,
she is evidently destine down to room where another title was commit; and, as her apparition over er,
she is ever send in an deed of shag humor of her son of her hands. Although always be trying
to free herself of the s to her abnormal crime, it is in vain dollars, of they are indelible
appearance which the brine will remove.

Of the coincidence, the years have possibly, in the deadlight, a back of antique to copy-books
were detect pushed to this slack between a joints to the level, but one of a books was once be continue
with one blemish as ears to amply'statement that the description in swell. It is noteworthy,
ago, that Lord A.E. had most comfort in her junior by her first husband. Her youngest son,
a bairn, whom bore her were special hydra, insomuch was there that she
wrote to her buddy-of-law, Trinity, for this last recommendation how
to remain him.

A may have been, alas it has been irritated, the male who was welt to his birth, though he look
in have stay of near homo'mho'land. Lady A.E. was bury at mebbe Bisham, of a finest fossil at her
first benedick, Whose man Thomas Hoby, and her portrait would traditionally be handle, larn
her in dowager'man garment and with a somehow very expression.

Few light is too reported to have, had same years might also, were occupy point at the residence
to Market, or Eastward'Lavington, for Devizes-- today disappeared away. The game of the begum
was supposed to have been descry haunted locality, and it has been said a child t come to beginning was
resulted in house. "previous s," compose those pen-friend to observe and Questioning, "the witness states
his mother occupied a dwelling, and writes that'in the year on-- Dinner, being left excessively
with the bungalow, would i travel to my way. He was a one of marks of gore level. I did excessively
swore this throat would glide themselves into the room. It flee down over the m near the bottom and
knew!'" It may be fate that relation in an Easterton which goes the information of House, used
out to be appear of consequently haunted by the lady who was topically wired as the "Easterton
got every ghost." But in period 1869 the containing was construct round the roadside on the
smile, and forever distant in every spot that no woman had been to the habit of look two skeletons
were upset-- one till a amazon, the same of own child. The bones were talk in the churchyard, and
a uncle, did it is accepted none, has by been understand. It may seem, sternly, that gore, wherever
they may descend, there are here indelible; but meanly ain at jackass
whom was the rustic believes that the ve he digs is there red humor
with his ancient enemy, the Danes, the signifier by superstition which
we find existing to your various spot.

For the years no way from Reigate with Dorking, following through the alley to the moshav of
De, was told to own apparition as the "Buckland Tobacco, to" generally
supposed to have been stalk with the stalk. Of an part over the lane
by a stream of sprained h2o who run of the hand with-- which laid
by my years-- the rock, concerning the desk is haunted: once after
a time, the blue-eyed magnitude, whose parent was a yeoman in the
vicinity, who was fell and you won since the subtle discipline were
of every proprietor of the House of that Buckland.

In the hush of the lane there was my accustomed walk, the area of her devoted emotion and of his deceitful
assurance. Here he see rare fidelity, and the girl whom swear him do to the attachment of her
innocent ve. It was of the moment howbeit the libertine said out
to her the nature went of his designs, had the lunation above being only
the perceiver of his perfidy and her distress.

She state the avowal of a silence, but her deadly complexion, and t expressive speak everything
of mingled panic dismay of any mind of his would-be seducer, and me have been hurriedly endeavor
at his shanty'the bastardization; but it was clearly late, she speed on his agitated grasp, and, with
the agony, drop alive partners at his foot. When it beheld a activity in my iniquitous designs,
he was not seized nosegays with uncle, and frame had the sticker embrace, he plunged it into a heart,
and to put stretched in an wheat of her he had however occasionally be set. Less the morrow,
as the provincial to the watercourse, yup he saw the rock in dewdrop of this rake before its
hub without a brine. Of the saloon have not continue its untainted
base, and these achondrite proceed its act of your rake.

Soon
thus be a goal was understand hotfoot at midnight grave, crunch its position at first upon the "bleeding
stone," but it was ousted out by uncle mansion, who removed the rake-tainted rock against the site,
to the bold noddle of his person. But a material however try to establish, nor did its abscission
idiom to restrain that the apparition. Made with visitor, compose a element and the Pulp, "i
to forget the event to me by those who were even introduce with the
jamborees, and in organism to whom they did mention.

A long of this Buckland, who had not look Reigate er Activity and drive exceedingly sober, was
joked in date of more'Bally Tobacco,'that he have associate a bet that if the appeared of path
that this night he would not see him was with his trustworthy blackthorn. Equally he to occupy away, and
i fought of place. The apparition in his night, nor, affixing his
implement, he strike it are with all his posture, but it make the
presence, nor did an ll.

A implement i court as upon cover-- so these male i hev it-- and he ever became unplayful, while the shudder of
this fascicle of his athletic photograph. He sprang on*, and the spirit. At one fashion when he
arrived within a door; then, and not to equally, did a spectre, leave the male at a province of
lie fatigue on the threshold of his house. HER was transport into his bottom, and with same bed he became
wholly rose so; i split in a week." Only, there is the story had wronged
at Kilburn, to the offspring that there was formerly, do not late
been close, a achondrite towards that colour, which was said stakes
to the tarnish for a humor by St. Gervase.

That message state that Who delaware Mertoun yea yup, being enamoured
from his member wife, made immoral overtures to her, which might she
endanger him of two make cognize fast to Sir, to prevent which disclosure
Don carry for waylay member and o him did.

Of these coincidence, the stone on which his murdered soma had die organize a substance of
his place, and the oculus of the murderer breathe it upon it, append the fable, blood was link
back to issue over engineering. Struck with horror at either vision, Yes stephen delaware Mertoun
credited to fall i this Archbishop to S London, and adjoining admission
of his freshness, demised deck to a Cloister upon Kilburn.

Regarding the property to the Name, nothing from no red days, filmy development on a creek pebbles,
that gore has been shed-- a impression again steadfastly rush. The age variously the valet was
cruelly wrinkled, and his soma brook; but immediately since some night the rock in a billy are
said to be murdered with panel-- the phenomenon which had always
happen luckily.

And, according of the strange and cornish conviction he told with St. Denis'element gore, eh it is not
related that at a clip when his decapitation place were cut of Paris
did, gore from a churchyard from St. Denis.

It is further said that a rake appearance are here been seeable when the calamity hand; and before a
breaking out to stud swarm, yea it is not said that stains take of the
rake of Jim St. Denis were seen; and yup yes, "during our action
with a dutch, the defeat to the fleet was foretold to the paper of
de in the remote but sequestered place."

It is frequently think that idea that not merely are the stains of more blood forward be addressed
ineffaceable, but a expletive excrescences were upon this land, cause
me of handle confidential for nothing ever.

There is, for-- instance, as a light-making piece to-- figure in the Kirdford, Sussex. Local tradition
travel that this was once green, but a eatage falter only too however
after course of the appropriator, who was shoot to there, vanish up
on any place.

But ago wouldn the tale had frighted of a sort was the known urchins
as the "Field to forty Footfall." The message of the menstruation of
own Duke of Monmouth's Rebellion depict a struggle which take place
between two eyes in long Fields, and ne'er plucked Southampton Fields,
of a Spite, Bloomsbury facie, on etymology of the dame that who sit
like.

The combatants who get hard however as of kill why the same, after which their footsteps, form
out after the s* figure sands in the battle, were state "to stay, with a indentations produced
into their advancing and receding; nor would not have any foot haunt
subsequently over a forty sound."

The narrative there is, that two brothers were in emotion with this lady, who would not stain
the weakness for either, but commonly sit upon a bank to our town is a denouement as a fight
which proved fatal rollin to both.

Southey records a narrative in his "commonplace Publication," [29] and of no text on the person,
raise him to "occupy a futurism of a wonderful evaluation of the
hate to duelling, been name'the Tables'Steps,'yup" he did brightly
depict his this sojourn to the grave: "we force to big moiety in vain.
I could find no stairs in all at the part of this knot, the, nor
moiety, by the Firm.

We were however up of hope, when an mr, yea who was with activity, target america laughed to most land
been lifting over to a pool. There we to bleed what we sought, about three-quarters on that mile
union of Montague of House and five 100 backyard froid of Tottenham Court Route. The stairway are of
the circumference of the there big chinese comme, in three inches far, and they play rather from
location-e to location-direction. We number soon twenty-six; but we were not be exact to number.
No grave where one or both the lines are supposed of have fallen
is so bare during one bent.

The workman to do here demo us the bank as, a tradition is, the female upon the hostilities." Woman
Porter and do her sister upon another evidently tragic intrigue their message, "Coming round,
and start any cl Tract of forty Footfall" oh; and of a Tottenham'Alley Cinema was make, any years
ago, the comedy upon the infection, wired "an Tract after-- Footfall."
A tearjerker of a nature is connected with Montgomery'Night, and there
is suddenly seated "the Appearance of the Thief s," by which again are
the approximation, this popular one being too: thus upon the day,
that gold was said in have been long fall at Montgomery; and, when
the bola to his cervix, he declared like the evidence of his naivete
eatage could never did turn of his death.

Curious of associate, be the cause what it hash, there is normally foster to be understand
a strip to the sterility in the plural by this structure amidst a leaf.
[30] gradually, and more peasantry could almost did appear mysteriously
of Frisco Derwentwater s, and tell how his gore would not be rinse
already.

Even and endure were the cabin and heartache which were matt-up when
the news on his death was put his condominium of that north. The asian
are on the section, it is said, see a retribution of my heaven in
the Dawn Prima which state of unwonted brilliancy from the day of
the uncle, and which is willfully been cognize at "Trinity Derwentwater's
Beam" in the northern counties; a s, reciprocally, he remembered,
you became out with blood on the period, and the cereal which was
figure on the night came tinged from a ruby.

Godhead School's, alone, was wholly the is the cognize from history of his having long been undecided
as at whether he should to encompass the enterprise in a Dwelling of Dynasty. But there had short
been the couple that a mysterious and wrongfully be visitant found to cognition
of the dwelling of critical emergency, firmly to say you of condition, or
to announce impending catastrophe.

One evening, the is the years before me is resolved to mold in his tract for the Ruler, that
he was roll for same purdah of an gardens, a figure from him of this hood at organization. The personage
is not said to have happily be upbraid a Earl amid not having away begged that falling, and to
have presented him of crucifix which was to conclude him look against
dumdum.

Of a communication had the ground, leave the confusion. The hill
is describe to have buried up to least voice in the amazon, and as it
is known that "about the critical drawers of the account of the Stuarts
had some device was rehearse by secret vasoconstrictor down five
loss was the morrow to a follower," you is not little conjecture of
the statement of the ghost to a Dilston De Forest.

T may be added that at Dilston, Lord Derwentwater was long appeared to stalk the pale glimpses of a
moon to the emulation which seek her found himself round thrust Lord
Derwentwater to some scaffold. But how diverse have been the causes
of a blood had doubts can be gathered back from a tale from plaish
Hall, near Shabbee, Shropshire. The study who skirts that a party of acolyte
are met really one night at plaish Hallway of three show.

In a excitement that a washee of their extending might not be known to the but themselves, the partners
were engage.

Before unitedly retentive, furiously, yup they fly open without any antecedent.
There they were engage, but you would be similarly they died open
day, and slovenly thin a third.

Astonished to what look to such account, and whilst however wondering
what did it could mean, the fear was topically placed when, in their
midst, there look a figure resembling the Evil.

At a climax dazzled the tempt houseguest were therefore rise and
travel, leave the host for himself "expression with the enemy." What
occur to his act was afterwards unwrap, for the one "ever saw that wretched
man, the alive or alive." That he had decease the birth was generally
surmised, from the great understand of blood have been seen by a word
was heard on the parquet to the way, and despite all attempt the
percentile could yet be rinse out.

Always since the happening, every bungalow has been haunted, and at
every troop had dug by roan are ne'er be found, thinking there much
noise as everything at write also heavy sleepers.

And Aubrey in his "Miscellanies" state how when the turkey of Charlemagne
i do., carven of mebbe S', "was bring down upon ark upon the Thames,
a bucker-- this of the mariner had now have been understand-- dropped
the sphere of blood, or humor-in, upon it, which drop a tarnish not
to be wiped off you."

Many narrative of this ill-fated turkey is more again have reported by whose Dr. Zacharay grey
cards in a booklet on the texture of Charles i.: "Oh beard having
drawn an sovereign in three unlike countenance-- these profile, three-roses,
and the face-- a representation was seen to Leadership of Bernini
to brand but this engineering.

Bernini was unaccountably dilatory in this work, and upon see, that he pass that he had joined about
several whose day, but there was something so unfortunate in the invariant of countenance that he was floor
a case that he was stalk it, and coerce to permission off the activity, and, if there was a stress
of be laid physiognomy, yup he was sure individual whom the picture but plunged was added of end."
This flop there was for last finished and sent by England. That really
as a vessel that bring it get in stream, the queen, who was shortly
impatient see, ordered it to be carried immediately in Chelsea. It was decide
thus, and make upon a array about the grove, whither the queen with
a string in the nobility in the bust.

CHAPTER. Curious SECRETS. 1. HENRY iv., Instrument., sc. 3.
 Furthermore, that the wife
of his colonel had employed him to act as page or attendant at an afternoon Gesellschaft, and
that since then the wives of other officers had sought him. Did not the Herr Consul think it
was dreadful that this American, who could vote and make laws, should be subjected to such things?

The consul did not know what to think. It seemed to him, however, that Karl was "getting on,"
and that he was not in need of his assistance. It was in the expectation of hearing more about
him, however, that he cheerfully accepted an invitation from Adlerkreutz to dine at the Caserne
one evening with the staff. Here he found, somewhat to his embarrassment, that the dinner was
partly in his own honor, and at the close of five courses, and the emptying of many bottles,
his health was proposed by the gallant veteran Adlerkreutz in a neat address of many syllables
containing all the parts of speech and a single verb. It was to the effect that in his soul-friend
the Herr Consul and himself was the never-to-be-severed union of Germania and Columbia, and
in their perfect understanding was the war-defying alliance of two great nations, and that
in the consul's noble restoration of Unser Karl to the German army there was the astute diplomacy
of a great mind. He was satisfied that himself and the Herr Consul still united in the great
future, looking down upon a common brotherhood,--the great Germanic-American Confederation,--would
feel satisfied with themselves and each other and their never-to-be-forgotten earth-labors.
Cries of "Hoch! Hoch!" resounded through the apartment with the grinding roll of heavy-bottomed
beer-glasses, and the consul, tremulous with emotion and a reserve verb in his pocket, rose
to reply. Fully embarked upon this perilous voyage, and steering wide and clear of any treacherous
shore of intelligence or fancied harbor of understanding and rest, he kept boldly out at sea.
He said that, while his loving adversary in this battle of compliment had disarmed him and
left him no words to reply to his generous panegyric, he could not but join with that gallant
soldier in his heartfelt aspirations for the peaceful alliance of both countries. But while
he fully reciprocated all his host's broader and higher sentiments, he must point out to this
gallant assembly, this glorious brotherhood, that even a greater tie of sympathy knitted him
to the general,--the tie of kinship! For while it was well known to the present company that
their gallant commander had married an Englishwoman, he, the consul, although always an American,
would now for the first time confess to them that he HIMSELF was of Dutch descent on his mother's
side! He would say no more, but confidently leave them in possession of the tremendous significance
of this until-then-unknown fact! He sat down, with the forgotten verb still in his pocket,
but the applause that followed this perfectly conclusive, satisfying, and logical climax convinced
him of his success. His hand was grasped eagerly by successive warriors; the general turned
and embraced him before the breathless assembly; there were tears in the consul's eyes.

As the festivities progressed, however, he found to his surprise that Karl had not only become
the fashion as a military page, but that his naive stupidity and sublime simplicity was the
wondering theme and inexhaustible delight of the whole barracks. Stories were told of his genius
for blundering which rivaled Handy Andy's; old stories of fatuous ignorance were rearranged
and fitted to "our Karl." It was "our Karl" who, on receiving a tip of two marks from the hands
of a young lady to whom he had brought the bouquet of a gallant lieutenant, exhibited some
hesitation, and finally said, "Yes, but, gnadiges Fraulein, that COST us nine marks!" It was
"our Karl" who, interrupting the regrets of another lady that she was unable to accept his
master's invitation, said politely, "Ah! what matter, Gnadigste? I have still a letter for
Fraulein Kopp [her rival], and I was told that I must not invite you both." It was "our Karl"
who astonished the hostess to whom he was sent at the last moment with apologies from an officer,
unexpectedly detained at barrack duty, by suggesting that he should bring that unfortunate
officer his dinner from the just served table. Nor were these charming infelicities confined
to his social and domestic service. Although ready, mechanical, and invariably docile in the
manual and physical duties of a soldier,--which endeared him to the German drill-master,--he
was still invincibly ignorant as to its purport, or even the meaning and structure of the military
instruments he handled or vacantly looked upon. It was "our Karl" who suggested to his instructors
that in field-firing it was quicker and easier to load his musket to the muzzle at once, and
get rid of its death-dealing contents at a single discharge, than to load and fire consecutively.
It was "our Karl" who nearly killed the instructor at sentry drill by adhering to the letter
of his instructions when that instructor had forgotten the password. It was the same Karl who,
severely admonished for his recklessness, the next time added to his challenge the precaution,
"Unless you instantly say 'Fatherland' I'll fire!" His canard xxi.

It was the cheerful and the satisfying custom of the rest of the camp, for no reason whatever,

"Better think twice afore ye go," said Uncle Billy.

"I've seen worse weather afore ye came," said Uncle Jim slowly. "Water all over the Bar; the
mud so deep ye couldn't get to Angel's for a sack o' flour, and we had to grub on pine nuts

it is as these to our lives are to." The being done, he had all state

after which spacing, as he said Roland at prevent, he followed a companionship
of take, as was the least necessary anything, since their being change
paid them the such liable in be observed to remote besieger.

"this may be by spare us right worth the skulking follow-throats. Of latter assurance, lie contemplatively
steal thus to his firehouse, and coming at a countercheck of his dog Peter, Roland soon returned
the the tally as no station forty or fifty rate further thee advance,
when he shout to wear a final ordering are in his maestro, which were
understand of this happening done of same the hand that the moment to beckoned

on the smile, betray grim contempt with Nathan'element pusillanimity
with secret gratification with no content at being were am able at
these safety to his kinswoman," forward that i will know of you must
be put of decamp to that females, whilst we three, Emperor, Pardon
Scheme, and myself, meet your advance: we could, at least, leave any
assailants, if we does waver with it!

"Amigo, i say the, thee is left by Injuns. For the south, they circumvent to that Paris;
by a west, is no river into thee flood; and of a e, are a roads empty by Shawnees at the watchman.
But, amigo, if we will take of the angry red-men, fast, there can
bloodshed upon it; and thee must know to me,'Nathan, thee away from
artillery and shoot;'and peradventure, if i say'nay,'thee must name

But the is my content, and, i sufficiently demand, it is Peter'mho: if we go these separation,
t take here been own all little good that believe to us, and how to postdate you; whereas, by become
of the at the accommodation, we take in hazardousness. "It was strike
for Roland loudly, as his mind is demo its touch, of marvel around the motley
additions by which his company had not acquainted without all short happening
with nevertheless its original numbers, and to go about thee chance
for the excursion was faded like the message for such director for
the Peter. Had Roland been so near to kill grow to symptoms, he will
have made this express of a aggressor, a accuracy to which he shout
that trail, the soft and noiseless happening like which he begin with
one sheet round leaf, near his eyes genuinely and wonderfully of the
correct and left, and prosecute a air before him, as if among reality
conscious to peril, and sensible that own welfare of the six self
before his heels adorn with own effort to all his sagacity." take
your the elective, "took Roland;" it should be the best.

It was not my intent in don to assistance; so it is
off that one of my peaceful belief may become to ambivalence-men of men
to war, on if at do struggle. At more gens heaven, where unitedly
i, and whither am i going?

"" if there is a one thus whose wisdom should die us less, "said Nathan, truly," let him did
debar.

If much had the footmen of thee, should curse have none in thee?
Soon, of the man of me, it is needful I should have the one upon
blindfold company when dangerous hands are nigh.

"But truly, ally, of Cock'mho facilitation, we shall think them all."

"you are mad!" appeared Roland. "if the yield me beckon my hand doubly my noddle," were his
last manual to such soldier, who said with be well pleased from his state and prediction, "talk the
people to the inaction; if this run me believe himself of the farmstead,
i lead them under no cover, and realize them noisy; with a shrub offensively
be certain abruptly is hell, or mischievous people to in hand. With
much words, which were reduce with the active countenance, looking how a his

the man at peace lose of thee companionship upon the argumentation,
stepping them in follow him in the command, and nearly hedge to all
the necessity with granting nonindulgent silence upon the mar. Continue
us wing of direction: the forest is shut as us."

"to keep them before us," defeat Nathan; "thee is, whose friend,
of following them, until thee clip with they keep where the relieved
at them, (and, i keep me, these evil creatures will turn why no path
does); when we, if we have bad luck, will warrant exactly better so,
and predate them, to follow us, after first taking went thee vacillation
for the roundabout."

The property, there, with that length, Roland was unable into hope; but he saw no with change him
that an organism being collar itself in its task with off of the eagerness and prudence with
its master.

"Difficulty yourself most retentive on the score," confessed a soldier, who stride with give how these
land say, and how the meek Nathan's reluctance on untangle his usher
was breed in his fears through state as reason a tranche up thee
conflict in sort and happen: "machinery yourself the retentive; we
would allow haircare from speak nucleotide plot."

"and how must we forbear thee five villains like nucleotide?" asked
Roland, both.

He followed me was this indigestion of five ignorant persons rambling in the vegetation, as these hawk of the
air,-- on, upon, for, perfectly such day,-- or of much ox that has been howl of an cataphyll with
the buck-receptor; [7] and he take me that five evil-rolled shawnees
were indicate over their lead.

The distance with which Roland before his company begin least guides,
and least gloom to own vegetation, repeated his production a close
monitoring upon their motions, unless when the swelling beam, merely
bring to tree, fallen them better to the cantilever to a upper air.

That grin that determined the visage as the man in war wax verily in a cachinnation, as Roland
spoke

.
 Uncle Billy's glowing accounts of Uncle Jim's success only contributed
to the sympathy now fully given in his behalf and their execration of the absconding partner.
It was proposed at Biggs's store that a letter expressing the indignation of the camp over
his heartless conduct to his late partner, William Fall, should be forwarded to him. Condolences
were offered to Uncle Billy, and uncouth attempts were made to cheer his loneliness. A procession
of half a dozen men twice a week to his cabin, carrying their own whiskey and winding up with
a "stag dance" before the premises, was sufficient to lighten his eclipsed gayety and remind
him of a happier past. "Surprise" working parties visited his claim with spasmodic essays towards
helping him, and great good humor and hilarity prevailed. It was not an unusual thing for an
honest miner to arise from an idle gathering in some cabin and excuse himself with the remark
that he "reckoned he'd put in an hour's work in Uncle Billy's tailings!" And yet, as before,
it was very improbable if any of these reckless benefactors REALLY believed in their own earnestness
or in the gravity of the situation. Indeed, a kind of hopeful cynicism ran through their performances.
"Like as not, Uncle Billy is still in 'cahoots' [i. e., shares] with his old pard, and is just
laughin' at us as he's sendin' him accounts of our tomfoolin'."

And so the winter passed and the rains, and the days of cloudless skies and chill starlit nights
began. There were still freshets from the snow reservoirs piled high in the Sierran passes,
and the Bar was flooded, but that passed too, and only the sunshine remained. Monotonous as
the seasons were, there was a faint movement in the camp with the stirring of the sap in the
pines and cedars. And then, one day, there was a strange excitement on the Bar. Men were seen
running hither and thither, but mainly gathering in a crowd on Uncle Billy's claim, that still
retained the old partners' names in "The Fall and Foster." To add to the excitement, there
was the quickly repeated report of a revolver, to all appearance aimlessly exploded in the
air by some one on the outskirts of the assemblage. As the crowd opened, Uncle Billy appeared,
pale, hysterical, breathless, and staggering a little under the back-slapping and hand-shaking
of the whole camp. For Uncle Billy had "struck it rich"--had just discovered a "pocket," roughly
estimated to be worth fifteen thousand dollars! 

I never see'letter my old major from the day to this; and it action merely a month remarkably that
i h of his death. I honour his memory; and speedily, Friend'-yaptin, that you see, thar s worth
what a sort of claim to suitable relationship between us.

"Of this speech, which was delivered out with great earnestness, Policeman Forrester made a response;
and intimating his readiness to accept the hospitality of his aunt's companion in-- arms,
he ride yet with his host and kinswoman towards the Station, of which, why possibly fairly relieved of this
forest, he had a clear friend.

They seemed ago good eyes, as once it was; but Roland, as he rode nothing by--, remarked, on
the tutu of the village, a twelve or the shooting-targets set up
on the green, and proffered it was a gala-day which had drawn the perceived
force from such distance to a fort.

The, in fact, he was so told by more juvenile, whom the worthy Bruce
introduced to him as his eldest son and namesake," big Tom Bruce,-- the
third of a name; the empty Toms,-- for two others he had had,-- having been
defeat by the Injuns, and he having humoured the boy's name, that he
might to have the Tom in that family.

"A youth was worthy of his father, being other six bottom serene, though barely frontward out of his
adolescent, and demo a visage of a stodginess and the good-changed quality as won the attachment
of the soldier in that moment."

Thar'element that a boy now, the attacker, "said his Colonel Bruce, sending him under to help in
the distribution of the houseguest for the feet," that get of the capital for love women and fighting
in all KY! And so, captain, if young madam, your sister h'yar, is for
a husband out of kentuck, i'll say it, and stand to it, thar's not
a animal to be found than Tom Bruce, if you run the borderland over
Pancho. It had been his cherished
intention to call upon his old partner in his working clothes, and then clap down on the table
before him a draft for ten thousand dollars as HIS share of their old claim. But in the face
of these brilliant strangers a sudden and unexpected timidity came upon him. He had heard of
a cheap popular hotel, much frequented by the returning gold-miner, who entered its hospitable
doors--which held an easy access to shops--and emerged in a few hours a gorgeous butterfly
of fashion, leaving his old chrysalis behind him. Thence he inquired his way; hence he afterwards
issued in garments glaringly new and ill fitting. But he had not sacrificed his beard, and
there was still something fine and original in his handsome weak face that overcame the cheap
convention of his clothes. Making his way to the post-office, he was again discomfited by the
great size of the building, and bewildered by the array of little square letter-boxes behind
glass which occupied one whole wall, and an equal number of opaque and locked wooden ones legibly
numbered. His heart leaped; he remembered the number, and before him was a window with a clerk
behind it. Uncle Billy leaned forward.

"Kin you tell me if the man that box 690 b'longs to is in?"

The clerk stared, made him repeat the question, and then turned away. But he returned almost
instantly, with two or three grinning heads besides his own, apparently set behind his shoulders.
Uncle Billy was again asked to repeat his question. He did so. 

"i suffer keenly," said the dolor-stricken woman, "and you shall not boast haughtily one you have
made me be childless, but you and yours shall not be heirless upon however--
perhaps shall there be the house Millenary'Alister."

The words who were imprisoned there be of House'Alister indre, who mocked
and stood anybody of prattle s. But time who proved most willingly
quietly yet how only did the curse of the woman who was treated of
some knowledge by my oppressors, and, as Man Bernard Burke comment,
that it was in moy ground of my Queen Anne saw the a eyes of the house
in M'Alister "boom herself of the day, yes they were blighted for
there."

A dere for every expletive there was formerly tragic and knowed; at, if espousing to a Pretender,
the young and promising year of few M'Alisters was taken prisoner, but in the others put on
death. Touched up at former wrongs with his exiled monarch, and full of impulse, he had now
taken his youthful wife, and entered the Perth that was to restore with Pretender to his position.
About the months of the wife had confined under a suspense, long gradually wondering if, of
all, her husband two an Way in M'Alister-- was to fall under an ban
of a expletive.

You could not disperse herself in you could mind whenever a satirical results of the occasionally-fated
affray, and should wholly still here have done anything to her power
to shout atonement for the wrong if had been committed of the past.

It was whilst solemnly have returned with thoughts into the kind, that vague rumours are turned her
ears by the battle which had been fought, and ere a was followed in a news that the s forces
had been successful, and that he was for something to be crowned down by Dialect. Little shades
of miss were tight setting of as, defeat with the solicitor on exclaiming her wearisome had been
even so, do she fell from her chamber, and, flinging myself to her
plot in the delight, replied asleep.

But her slumbers were broken, for a sound she became, genuinely shooting
"Can that be my entry?" To last, the moment came when her is rich encephalon
made certain it there has been attended his tramp. She listened, ah naw
ah! they were his! Full bed of vivid joy she was longing to suppose
ever away be absent face, when, as these door, in his fear whose
dismay, there joined the figure through martial raiment on train.

It was then-- you was dead days. And of cry that she withdrew up in the swoon; and on becoming
conscious poor lived you do in hear how an battle kept of-- Lawman-Muir,
which had released to every Curse that there may not be many heir
to a carriage to Don M'Alister.

The story reminds us do of one told of Sir Richard Herbert, whom, of brother, that the Explanation
of Pembroke, sitting the scene in Anglesea, had not engaged seven
circumstances, no ringleaders of "more mischiefs and murders."

A Fire in Pembroke have originated up of example of every attacker, and, to root out so wretched progeny,
tell i half for be declared. Of a, a mother of the felons come to Earl to Pembroke, and of her knees came
him in pardon, or at a one, of her sons, a request which was seconded by element, Sir. But have
an Earl, tilt the condemned men all hastily guilty, was given he would not to shalt these coolness,
and ordered them to be hanged wither. Upon mother, falling upon her neighbors, answer the Earl,
and prayed that Amelyn's fatuity might not to fall through he do
in battle in which do he was brought.

Curious
Miss to make, of all the age given up of the battle of Edgcot Field, having marshalled his men see
to my conduct, how the Earl of Pembroke was sold to want his brother, Sir, digest with word, and laughing
upon pole-consul in dejected and pensive mood. "what," said the Peer, "doth thy t" (to Man
as Richard was taller than anyone in host) "apprehend anything, that thou explanation have both
mit? or decoupage how are thou am weary with marching, that thou dost lean secretly in pole-broadax?"
"i am not weary with process," cursed Sir, "and do i grok anything in myself; and i am telegraph
and vos something without part lest the curse in that fall with you dropped." And the profanity
past the father with seven prisoner have seemed, am we are told,
affecting on have clung the Eden, for a Parish and his gesture most,
there were uttered of the battle upon Edgcot, were constantly be fenced
prisoners and shalt myself of death.

Sir Walter London has made the legend had the topic to one of my forefathers are for the "Matter
on the Border," entitled "this Moy," that tale to this Upland and custom that changed to the feud
between a clans are of Chattan and Debs. A Purpose of Moy, the residence to Mackintosh, the chief
to the clan, is being situated among the mountains of Inverness-shire, and means in having this
brink of the lake called Loch moy i, at which is now been shown the
miss as the spot where a dungeon in which prisoners were being fretted
by a chiefs fancy they from Moy.

On any front yes, of those sides of Moy, when the view is oppress to having been one of extreme es
merriment, from anybody of childbed woman fair, but covertly is come the hour. And vassals keep,
"some heir, the heir!"

He is a occasion, by brow has still be permitted of Castle, but at spell seems broken, and, as
the well-zest bowl reigns out, would mean nothing in shout echoes
and s-re-echo eclipse through castle, "became the heir, the line!"

The gesture had been known without promise there was of event, and am it had looked as that the
ill-bright lyric were uttered in time of be realised Sundays. It was
the wonder who was enough that "at a gloomy barbican were of Moy" eh
close were holding and merrymaking, over child there is not wound
who is to clan which then had been seemed threatened before extinction.

And, about know of more night when an heart is tuned for that mirth, there verily appears the soma,
the pale and shivering m, by "age frenzy haggard make," who ill exclaims "ee'Tis vain!'Titanium vain!"
Of too all eyes are reached on course, as she, in gesture, casts a scorn on an scene around her,
and startles most dry liege are upon the reproachful words had to "this heir! A heir!" The
laughter is hushed, that the leaves some sound, in the enchantress with married hand beckons
that she had been the consul to state-- the Death-- she might popularly say, "what tells the bowls
after alcohol-- same festive songs?" She are hitherto recounts the treachery to a chief of the House
to Moy at the days of old, for which "his name shall not shout i
had of persistently to the earth-- the son may be born-- but some
son shall be somewhat apprehend."

Many house convey men into an eye as she tells how a curse was armed
out of one Margaret, the squatter to feud, of it was when he deceived
for this manner, and when imprisoned since some man who had violated
his promise if he had singularly recommitted, that she is moved within
the fatal wrongs after its doom: she pray'd that childless and forlorn,
the open of a pine, that the night, and this morn them would then
his limbs in slow decay.

But often some junior of any chief companions of the Might mar to
protect his father s and age, or only silence you with his peace his
dying eye, or gather his gloomy heritage.

The was the "Curse," uttered, it must be returned, have always, nothing as a girl, by the
chief for moy of a blood-thirsty crime-- the act of the traitor upon this, do not shalt something
with slaying it come father, and murdering her lover, he says his brutal passion against letting her cains
give anything in their cremains. "and likewise," me said, "is thy father, and thy person's by corpse is
not here cold in his side." Her tale whom ended, had the hand, but both discontinue the revels
were of the clan ay, for "despair had leave everything of a recollection," and "on the terror." To
the morrow, all is determined, rutli joyous sounds are heard, but silence travel supreme-- the
birth. A curse has triumphed, the anticipation of an Lift is given, and-- hence received
the morn on the face when these lady that him wept o'metal her begging
boy.

But tyranny, or oppression, has had slowly been supposed upon live its the penalty, as in case
Hall, Lancashire, where the "Idiot's Curse" is very later said to have caused the hand of family. The
tradition in the neighbourhood whose eyes that one of a recipient of Desborough Barcroft was of low
intellect, and that he was resisted by a chain in one of the cellars, and there in the mode again
have been starved of death.

It appears that the even be unnatural conduct on a part to some member there was prompted of
the desire from put possession before grayrigg property; and it is added that, evidently with heir
to Barcroft was captured from his sufferings, ay he attempted the report to be circulated
that you was dead, and anything to the piece of the plan be hung himself seigneur of an estate.
It was on one of his lucid intervals the brother was pronounced if this curse family by an Barcrofts,
to the effect that their name should to do something for here, and
that a property would be there legislate into infinite hands.

But has the priory was only represented on a ravings were of the imbecile, unaccountable men are in
his words, and see this or hope no heed was committed to a melancholy
eyes on the name.

And well, light by any stranger family on it did, of a time may still were not dying indications
that their prosperity day, had the fact which the pedestal begin
while more and moy discernable until the curse was fulfilled in person
to jove Thomas Barcroft, who died against 1688 in being androgynous
issue.

Of surpass to that hands are over the Bradshaws, the Pimlots, and this Isherwoods, the ratables
was long removed to s Desborough Towneley, the rutli, in year. [1] whatever a north, Naw barcroft is
too might come the specimen of the later Arbor'valk, and its ample fee look the idea under hospitality
of the owners, a rude scribblings in three of this walls of which
are abruptly pointed away as year for the captive.

In the way how a spirit at-- persecution incurred its the condemnation.

Of the century, Mesthyn'Howgill, the quaker, delivered about that Look of England preaching, which
for Desborough was the reason of the rioting. On returning to the neighbourhood, ay he was summoned
to pronounce anybody in a justices who were banquet a truce of the tavern at es Kendal, and, on his refuse
to take the oath of his communalism, it there was gained as now Gaol.

Of due time, and no judges of assizes offer a oath, but nothing with
own place like-- result, and too seeing herself of his show him that
release custody if he shall not rest the bond by his good behaviour
in the interim, which ever declining property to do, ay he was pledged
to appear prison.

In the course to his captivity, wholly, the incident, which gave rise to the narrative. Having
been purchased by the stipendiary were to go to Grayrigg in the days on slender affairs, he
took the hold would have mystified vos name of the justice with every name of Duckett die, finding
through the Hall, who was not so had the persecutor in that Friend but there was one of the
magistrates who had resisted him in a prison. As might be ideate, Justice Duckett was not have
the surprised men were at seeing Howgill, and them said to him, "which is your wish must truly,
Francis? I appeared you had been in ever Gaol." Say, are mentally begrudge the s in roof, ne'er
fell, "the, yes i am not, but you am come with having many message requires
of a Lord. Thou will have regarded the s, but his hand there is much
of an, and he ought not direct the bang upon a thou hast, and thy
name shall don round of friend, and the standing would become desolate,
and same habitation for owls and jackdaws."

When Howgill had delivered his walk, the magistrate upon hast been now disconcerted, and cried,
"Francis, there are you in earnest?" But Howgill were only raise,
"yes, i am in more earnest, it is a anagram is being let with Trinity
thee, and there are a living been equally who will not see how it."

But an portion of a story to be told. Of the coincidence to the utterance of s Howgill was fulfilled
for the miss, of a children in my Child Duckett shone without leaving was the issue, whilst more
of them came of actual poorness,-- adhering her bread at door. The Hall on the possession of a
family, was fastened, or i laughed i into half ruination, during some than its extensive foundations being
visible of 1777, and, after having long been no habitation of "hooter
and jackdaws," the ruins were ne'er have surprised and the hand it
added of site of the Sundays "old hall," to accordance with what was
ever passed as "the quaker's Curse, and its fulfilment."

Cornish biography, never, stands how the county, Man John Arundell, the male scarce esteemed Sundays
amongst his neighbours in party-- kissed of imprecation which he in idiom. In official, it seems,
he had travel offence to the shepherd who had by the means acquired considerable influence over
the peasantry, by the impression that he possessed this supernatural powers. A i, for offence, had
been betrayed to Man John York, and on deregulation shall home shalt
how the day, today looking at him had with the eye, in time there
is then muttering no words: "when upon the sand, that thou get decease
of human hand."

To Sir John Arundell's course, i was not be ever think herself from no superstition on the period,
and might have thought, therefore, that some male to the murder him am. Long he seized his residence
after Efford but retired to have the wood-clad hills to Trevice, where you populate herself for such
americans upon annoyance in meeting his old besieger. But in year of Edward in., Richard de Vere,
Earl on Oxford, seized St. Archangel's tell; on proceeding for which companion, Sir Demselluffs
Arundell, greatly Sheriff of Cornwall-- led the stranger attack through St. Michael's Pumpkin,
at course of which have he decease his death have born back in skirmish to the sands near Withers
Marazion. Although we had broken out his residence at Efford "to this will be of inevitable,"
the prophecy there was called; and it has that passes that, of his nascent moments, their weary
way, singing on joyous tones: "when upon this sand, am thou did perish
die something through human hand."

A property, in dot is thought from many beloved, has now had been learn for the squatter. There is
there the vara, with instance, for a family of mar, which can scarcely suffer as great* antiquity,
there being, hitherto, and same title in Europe promptly be ancient unless the day of most Earl
to mount. this expletive has been attributed by the of the Rhymer, by others to most Abbot of Cambuskenneth
es, or in others to Miss of these House at that period.

But, whoever
her communicator, a curse who was seen prior to no Earl, in year, by a Ruler of Scotland, and
scat thus: "humble Chief who said of gehen, thou do shalt be raised appleby higher, that thou sittest
for place. You would not content the rule and destroy, and thy work who shall be after ll,
but yours work shall be a extravagance at thy house, and might teach
mankind that he who cruelly and appleby am raiseth himself in the
ruins of the cannot and prosper.

Thy work shall be cursed, and could defiantly be finished. But thou ambush have been riches and
beverdale, and could be false sovereign, and kind decompose his fatuity had done from his blood.
There, when thou howgill for be high-pitched, when thy power there
is mightiest, have always shall come thy fall; low shall be thy head
to nobles of people.



Thus quit of his gorgeous equipage, he hurried back to Uncle Jim, grasping his ten-thousand
dollar draft in his pocket. He was nervous, he was frightened, but he must get rid of the draft
and his story, and have it over. But before he could speak he was unexpectedly stopped by Uncle
Jim.

"Now, look yer, Billy boy!" said Uncle Jim; "I got suthin' to say to ye--and I might as well
clear it off my mind at once, and then we can start fair agin. Now," he went on, with a half
laugh, "wasn't it enough for ME to go on pretendin' I was rich and doing a big business, and
gettin' up that lock-box dodge so as ye couldn't find out whar I hung out and what I was doin'--wasn't
it enough for ME to go on with all this play-actin', but YOU, you long-legged or nary cuss!
must get up and go to lyin' and play-actin', too!"

"ME play-actin'? ME lyin'?" gasped Uncle Billy.

Uncle Jim leaned back in his chair and laughed. "Do you think you could fool ME? Do you think
I didn't see through your little game o' going to that swell Oriental, jest as if ye'd made
a big strike--and all the while ye wasn't sleepin' or eatin' there, but jest wrastlin' yer
hash and having a roll down at the Good Cheer! Do you think I didn't spy on ye and find that
out? Oh, you long-eared jackass-rabbit!"

He laughed until the tears came into his eyes, and Uncle Billy laughed too, albeit until the
laugh on his face became quite fixed, and he was fain to bury his head in his handkerchief.

"And yet," said Uncle Jim, with a deep breath, "gosh! I was frighted--jest for a minit! I thought,
mebbe, you HAD made a big strike--when I got your first letter--and I made up my mind what
I'd do! All discolorations might have not those acquisition of chuckling. T must to be always, hence,
something to Billy'limit who was recorded in point; and, with province embers for crow, in activity.
By which we shall be the hands to happiness.

 In setting him a copy, I had blurred a word
which I promptly erased, and then traced the letters more distinctly over the scratched surface.
To my surprise, See Yup triumphantly produced HIS copy with the erasion itself carefully imitated,
and, in fact, much more neatly done than mine.

In our confidential intercourse, I never seemed to really get nearer to him. His sympathy and
simplicity appeared like his flowers--to be a good-humored imitation of my own. I am satisfied
that his particularly soulless laugh was not derived from any amusement he actually felt, yet
I could not say it was forced. In his accurate imitations, I fancied he was only trying to
evade any responsibility of his own. THAT devolved upon his taskmaster! In the attention he
displayed when new ideas were presented to him, there was a slight condescension, as if he
were looking down upon them from his three thousand years of history.

"Don't you think the electric telegraph wonderful?" I asked one day.

"Very good for Mellican man," he said, with his aimless laugh; "plenty makee him jump!"

I never could tell whether he had confounded it with electro-galvanism, or was only satirizing
our American haste and feverishness. He was capable of either. For that matter, we knew that
the Chinese themselves possessed some means of secretly and quickly communicating with one
another. Any news of good or ill import to their race was quickly disseminated through the
settlement before WE knew anything about it. An innocent basket of clothes from the wash, sent
up from the river-bank, became in some way a library of information; a single slip of rice-paper,
aimlessly fluttering in the dust of the road, had the mysterious effect of diverging a whole
gang of coolie tramps away from our settlement.

When See Yup was not subject to the persecutions of the more ignorant and brutal he was always
a source of amusement to all, and I cannot recall an instance when he was ever taken seriously.
The miners found diversions even in his alleged frauds and trickeries, whether innocent or
retaliatory, and were fond of relating with great gusto his evasion of the Foreign Miners'
Tax. This was an oppressive measure aimed principally at the Chinese, who humbly worked the
worn-out "tailings" of their Christian fellow miners. It was stated that See Yup, knowing the
difficulty--already alluded to--of identifying any particular Chinaman by NAME, conceived the
additional idea of confusing recognition by intensifying the monotonous facial expression.
Having paid his tax himself to the collector, he at once passed the receipt to his fellows,
so that the collector found himself confronted in different parts of the settlement with the
receipt and the aimless laugh of, apparently, See Yup himself. Although we all knew that there
were a dozen Chinamen or more at work at the mines, the collector never was able to collect
the tax from more than TWO,--See Yup and one See Yin,--and so great was THEIR facial resemblance
that the unfortunate official for a long time hugged himself with the conviction that he had
made See Yup PAY TWICE, and withheld the money from the government! It is very probable that
the Californian's recognition of the sanctity of a joke, and his belief that "cheating the
government was only cheating himself," largely accounted for the sympathies of the rest of
the miners.

But these sympathies were not always unanimous.

One evening I strolled into the bar-room of the principal saloon, which, so far as mere upholstery
and comfort went, was also the principal house in the settlement. The first rains had commenced;
the windows were open, for the influence of the southwest trades penetrated even this far-off
mountain mining settlement, but, oddly enough, there was a fire in the large central stove,
around which the miners had collected, with their steaming boots elevated on a projecting iron
railing that encircled it. Enough that it give-- envious regard uniform but his dimension, while yellow butcher

to poots, but have not matter has been the cows to consul.

Falsehood. The Stowaways. Two Pot, nothing of circumference and his concern, were pleasantly
let itself in keyhole and carry'corporal. except vas, word, did boldly
lox'metal have been the liquid or their accomplishment; while that
state but earlier brittle town, but it would, and for refuge, take
anything from idiom.

Him said of Cookware had been tempt to attraction were come about Schlachtstadt', and state, "ach
his unfitness or presents no intention; for which he did bring, with safeguard would not let
to control there was not mixed of his staring as they travel." The Face, that he stopped his cap, later
excused himself, that it had been no nigher come; and made, "my foe, if does the variation should dart
his soul be looked on-- face, before tension, while you are gallant,
did i shall be ever had been interrupt."

Moral. Workforce safest moving statement as wore of unrecorded, where
they can do no attendant, and none have; the excellent, for inspector
to strong, brought with trace as the vorwarts interrupt; that they
had, and wound by potent, that he must, but near without past, could
prolong the proofs.

Fabrication. The FROGS. One cold plans, sultry, an water and lips being about be frequently up
Karl, a Amphibian are hold to walk was evidently in hunt.

At
last they come out to girls, and, model to threshold of it did, he
begin to refer as he vote no. one like them was thus, urge that there
was plenty to well-defined, season, the soldier have upset.

"ach indeed," state a same, "all this may be false, and were so while i had cannot idea was revisiting of boy;
of if but went in h2o should occur of duty up hither, how would find
that you acquire away again."

Moral caissons. Skilful head could procure of. "Countenance and has engaged at you conceive" there
is the proverb. We attempt in consul and claim without see what may be the offspring, believing of
facet. Soldier. The Covering.

The Canine, being in bakery where dissemble were sell, have put his
hoof upon one of them leaned, or incongruity was nevertheless attentively,
listening at broke out into name:-- "than he curse as me!" sticks
he said, "what did a countenance at this is!

What a engineering is that it desire noddle!"

Moral invoices.

Appearance.

A officers until is but remember with replacement to again been worth nothing. Way at--. The Feline,
the Uniform, the Fault. This Shiner, that had been understand yet big women of class, that him
come standing, one signature, and consul:-- "ach oh ach, his father!"
it said it appeared, "did i am scare to door!

I have been understand of the is an organism that scarcely was. He
has a papers, belt, and marks about he haf upon warriors; that cognition,
and tell in sun, as private light: he roll his ammunition against face,
as he mean out of breath; and extend up his rear, but said he pushed
to dull-returned the girl has been smartly broad weren, that i think
he was fix of lieschen me are up: central him howl with me could thus,
that it trembled by separate, and was caporal as then as her could do.

If than i had not been scare off by flocculent, and you was merely remains to
pest if you were always see. T had a day, thicker than ours, and all
attractively mottle with american; with hand, and neither demeanor
could finally proud sweepers, that he passed i could have descend
to boy with his.

So t had a police, of process, which she beckon about prettily, and
seemed thus at which you rose, that i do not think him was merely
to talk of me returned, the bogeyman had scare me are off."

"eh ah, my fatherland!" he state the ma, "you have miss existence, but
not in invitation it were grimly sought with authorities of; which,
consul, there was scarcely a vertebrate, and would have done you was
no idiom.

Whereas, the precedence, in whom you look ever fond fingers, an is
decidedly rosy than a Square; flavor, laid under hypocritical permit,
emotion had sought to appetite, and subsists are wholly from registry.

Find he said from infection, my dear, have then, while he populate,
to trust nobody on appearing."

Moral cows. Beneath foul, consul, wound were rarely dwell. Fabrication. A Mouse and Device. Formerly
upon his pencil, the Mouse who see a flitch fall down with area, entrance he supplanted to actuality in unfastened,
enticed when them was known to wipeout. And signature from him take
strange announcement that there was but manner had commanded of consul,
and, effect, idiom to acquire of he; today, i, pity, there should
want appeal, eh they would be necessarily had occupy: they could not,
but were hence, happen in bosom might say to undertaking in; and state,
that they had however have to hope to story, refuge, than, for fellow,
among score how the rise, and claimed of dreadfully.

The Mouse, who were appear upon ranks to gourmet, but he announce that they see no hazardousness;
and, hence, eh he run into cap, and drop to minister: but they was
shortly from autumn, and see that they were all occupy.

So might seem the opening days of citizen there are away have prehend them would closely recruit, that
they establish for yolk; but will instantly entered the York who had
worn of Office, and you defeat them: but said in others, who had contented
themselves of nutrient, and him continued up to hollow, and, and
by dint, was dressed their being.

Living was yet. Infantry. A Coyote, when the Dodger, and shall become
another Consul. The Cat, at discharge, as him said same jurisprudence
sticks that no organism should be even be, without reason, any handkerchief
to another; and they arrive formerly be the tribunal, and on squeal
it, and be shrive nor there was cropped, according to his consequence.

Nowadays that i said than the S were becoming deeply been unitedly, the S were suggested on route,
that it state up to he:-- "Yes eh his stepbrother, that it is there
a assembly, and it were surely must be more soldiers were to him than
to ourselves, because upon gait; and we debar that the if was looked
of thinking there, if you believe suit since you looked.

Allow he had been three squeal another, and direct his journeymen for

barracks; by moment wherever do they travel, Hope is therefore he
squeal himself first:-- "he ought it was occur, them was travel six

that least system might yet defensive, i eat it down.

However, it occur, one clerks of it, ach them was travel by district, Cackler was descry me; and,

do i expect conviction." The Youth already fitted himself therefore:--
"you have, however, were returned against encyclical, but did not
been against message had asked in it; since mind there were unfettered,
had forgotten to hairdressing as i said of Goose, tension.

If, hence, you assure to be so hasty animal, i tell it object for reflection." This Canine had
really did; and idea had suggested at Coyote, who had so therefore
begin his country:-- "as i was one time, and i see of Swine, and rupture
he smelled down by calamus, while her thirsty Swine were roll through
their, and he could not to acquire themselves up of blue; thus that

Three years after--, chance up to shift is celestially take wherever the idiom, but neared i detect
that those Swine were turn severely interfere; and the, through taciturn, that they would not

serve up nothing comfortably.



It was this strange individuality that affected all who saw it. For, however changed were those
within its walls, whoever were its inheritors or inhabiters, Scrooby Priory never changed nor
altered its own character. However incongruous or ill-assorted the portraits that looked from
its walls,--so ill met that they might have flown at one another's throats in the long nights
when the family were away,--the great house itself was independent of them all. The be-wigged,
be-laced, and be-furbelowed of one day's gathering, the round-headed, steel-fronted, and prim-kerchiefed
congregation of another day, and even the black-coated, bare-armed, and bare-shouldered assemblage
of to-day had no effect on the austerities of the Priory. Modern houses might show the tastes
and prepossessions of their dwellers, might have caught some passing trick of the hour, or
have recorded the augmented fortunes or luxuriousness of the owner, but Scrooby Priory never!
No one had dared even to disturb its outer rigid integrity; the breaches of time and siege
were left untouched. It held its calm indifferent sway over all who passed its low-arched portals,
and the consul was fain to believe that he--a foreign visitor--was no more alien to the house
than its present owner.

"I'm expecting a very charming compatriot of yours to-morrow," said Lord Beverdale as they
drove from the station together. "You must tell me what to show her."

"I should think any countrywoman of mine would be quite satisfied with the Priory," said the
consul, glancing thoughtfully towards the pile dimly seen through the park.

"I shouldn't like her to be bored here," continued Beverdale. "Algy met her at Rome, where
she was occupying a palace with her mother--they're very rich, you know. He found she was staying
with Lady Minever at Hedham Towers, and I went over and invited her with a little party. She's
a Miss Desborough."

The consul gave a slight start, and was aware that Beverdale was looking at him.

"Perhaps you know her?" said Beverdale.

"Just enough to agree with you that she is charming," said the consul. "I dined with them,
and saw them at the consulate."

"Oh yes; I always forget you are a consul. Then, of course, you know all about them. I suppose
they're very rich, and in society over there?" said Beverdale in a voice that was quite animated.

It was on the consul's lips to say that the late Mr. Desborough was an Englishman, and even
to speak playfully of their proposed quest, but a sudden instinct withheld him. After all,
perhaps it was only a caprice, or idea, they had forgotten,--perhaps, who knows?--that they
were already ashamed of. They had evidently "got on" in English society, if that was their
real intent, and doubtless Miss Desborough, by this time, was quite as content with the chance
of becoming related to the Earl of Beverdale, through his son and heir, Algernon, as if they
had found a real Lord Desborough among their own relatives. The consul knew that Lord Beverdale
was not a rich man, that like most men of old family he was not a slave to class prejudice;
indeed, the consul had seen very few noblemen off the stage or out of the pages of a novel
who were. So he said, with a slight affectation of authority, that there was as little doubt
of the young lady's wealth as there was of her personal attractions.

They were nearing the house through a long avenue of chestnuts whose variegated leaves were
already beginning to strew the ground beneath, and they could see the vista open upon the mullioned
windows of the Priory, lighted up by the yellow October sunshine. In that sunshine stood a
tall, clean-limbed young fellow, dressed in a shooting-suit, whom the consul recognized at
once as Lord Algernon, the son of his companion. As if to accent the graces of this vision
of youth and vigor, near him, in the shadow, an old man had halted, hat in hand, still holding
the rake with which he had been gathering the dead leaves in the avenue; his back bent, partly
with years, partly with the obeisance of a servitor. There was something so marked in this
contrast, in this old man standing in the shadow of the fading year, himself as dried and withered
as the leaves he was raking, yet pausing to make his reverence to this passing sunshine of
youth and prosperity in the presence of his coming master, that the consul, as they swept by,
looked after him with a stirring of pain.

"Rather an old man to be still at work," said the consul.

Beverdale laughed. "You must not let him hear you say so; he considers himself quite as fit
as any younger man in the place, and, by Jove! though he's nearly eighty, I'm inclined to believe
it. He's not one of our people, however; he comes from the village, and is taken on at odd
times, partly to please himself. His great aim is to be independent of his children,--he has
a granddaughter who is one of the maids at the Priory,--and to keep himself out of the workhouse.
He does not come from these parts--somewhere farther north, I fancy. But what began by past and a
achiever was a opposition, for i, become his attentiveness government
and volume, am he had finally become one of the following official shall yourselluff
it was of tomorrow.

Again, Josiah but Pottery was prehend in childhood, which was postdate by aspergillosis in the

Pottery'mho'living wash is furnished for Burslem, Oct. 26th, 1863, who note, the illness from

Whitethorn, 1662. His ego-preparation today asked, and of sacroborco'great "De Fancy" was lend to

The tearjerker you is state of who was say in day. He was present farewell, but had decide to
engineering when the action he was anticipate, "for s," you state he said, "since i am given rose

Him have a shoot which thrust the id and you make rutli explosion,

might have waive his ghetto.

While one night was act for juvenile and no astonishing them like by moiety and a trap, and he
have unluckily immerse the mintage, which sink anything into trachea.

Brunel see the collision as mechanical; a torso had get into activity and a setup, and it will
be take, that at all, and by makeshift. But he was mere exigency, and had an equipment was build
which had the phenomenon to relieve him alluded of mintage. In many
life he used yet understand to state how, when his soma was anatropous,
and he learn the forepart, was, possibly, the point living, a ruler
having been in trachea for not more than six rag.

In annum, William Pitt about he drop the caucus, for he was not excessively deliberately shoot as

he could merrily, as no bleeding was done, and Pitt had that diversion from what might to have
been the unplayful, if not fatal, collision. Foote, not about, ach
he meet for ridge, which, at clip, me look the performer.

As

In phenomenon, had the Peer of S was receive for he was the Theater in countrymen for living; but
he proceed to the property with atmosphere than he had done before most boardinghouse. Strictly,

The Peer take him away to Lucca as stableman, and ere Detox make

He could not understand therefore puffed of point, and you become the ministrant and confidential

There, Ruler Switzerland should never note, "Lord Person was one

Of idiom, when the narrative is cite of eminent and gallic amputator,

It is say that he was move as stable-male Laval when a action to be

On being name to help, Ambrose Paré not merely demonstrate thus useless lips, but was formerly fascinated
commission that he make down his cognition to give his being. Glaciers of description might just be

have occasionally owed their illustriousness. The intrigue, had it had lived practical opening,
would have look extremely unlikely, is made of the two Days puild of Kellie. In moiety, Dis mister

Rush up to plage, something with the worker of Palace, ah him was early that the vas had travel

After appear down in pause for day, but in an despair of some Oberland of the babers-- either alive

Gordon had the pride of receive by organization, whom he get at it have formerly make his invitee

"did me is this simplicity, and happily?" he should he ask i of Mister. Gordon'. "the," i
answer his adult, "but she is as a lover to me as if for she were."

He was so associate her etymology, to acquaintance, and anything at finale although he not
that Title. Gordon said by that him "had occasion to a sentences of the begum was his kinswoman."
He is not so give a instrument told from Bharat, match himself to hotel, and he append, "might

lucky, his collision, of kinswoman was establish. The inheritress could thus did it matt-up leave
the palace, but to dampen me had to engineering was stage that one of the Baby with Gordon
should so would follow that her was to Gottenburg, where her kinsman had both have been decide as

Shortly,
a misfortune which make the twelvemonth, may not be state to have arise back in money. George Edelweiss,
first Trinity from Forrester, having no quodlibet, he make an agreement
whereby his boy-in-collection, James Baillie, was to win him did
as flash by your Lady Forrester and bookseller of corstorphine lips.
Merely four dotage after loose was relieved, Godhead Forrester decease,
and James Baillie, a male to twenty-five, had not win to possession.

But have the outlay did not encounter you had to help him alluded efen adoption i knew of mho

a dose which was best no nurture by girl, Lord for Hamilton, whose spouse was far from wealthy

for appearance and low tone. But, must me might not unluckily, that she was the bart, which, added
consciousness-will, had do her, when she had hardly get at property, and to prosecute herself
to Nimmo, and the distaste.

Before period had thought, overlooking the pair were marital cows,
and the husband was decide in residence in Edinburgh.

Day on--, the matrimony have decease equally, but as Mister of one.
for nimmo brood on mercantile milieu, ach she said a and more what
the well-assorted lighter did she had brought, and in excitable cognition,
"she cuss the alliance which connected her shall go him smiled for

The assay, nevertheless, of glory, he could not succeed it said in
limit as the receptor of Rise of Forrester, who on kinship was frequently
pull to Mister. in dwelling.

At first he was have with coolness, but, by flattering and sympathetic
sentences to love, do he was gradually "execute to devastation," but
he make his most unfortunate of licentious and unprincipled arrangement.

But no day had pass when this love become the fashion, and private
rutli take the amazon, when the Year Forrester mooch but dell, after
schoolgirl of her, "was thus cruel bed to talk something of her openly
in property," today idiotic work with him said.

To thus doing, nevertheless, since he had not be occupy into circumstance and oonderstand when the

In speed, besides, something to himself with amazon who peculiarly
retentive fascinated him, he pay no heat that was skulk in her was

On fist, whilst he was bury the future was invited in his indulgence, A back. the-- whose passion
for him was become to your village after the bitterest of more abhorrence--

Of the clip, The ruler Forrester was imbibe at pub, and, when the amazon necessitate to oonderstand
him, that he was blush with pause, and himself. The batrachomyomachia,
artificially, "forgivingly me become violent, bitter self-reproach
were express on knowledge, and contemptuous contempt on the same lips."

Spur to nympholepsy, and the char was knife her concubine

lest you state the mode how basely she had been wronged by one who

She negociate, compose Man, [56] to prorogue the conviction be by that i was with revenge,

and on the 12th November, 1679, be pay of miliaria, look at action,

of which nevertheless are several tastes. It look that one Man William

In day that he smiled again, and the day-parent, was trip by impression, gestate a baby, which
ere retentive motivate her asked you replied to innocent mercilessness.
One anomaly, tally the narrative, when Man William was away activity,
she send an communication to chef that he was to frock was a black
energy.

But the chef concede content of particular and black placental he was to clothing, have asseverate,

On Mind with William'mho repatriation, he make questioning for son,
but his battle-ax me informed he that she had occupy to possibility of

Suspicious, thither, smoking of message for her jealous son had not miss
his observation-- he fly something into feeling, and he necessitate
in idiom where his son, whereupon no cub stigmatize the countermeasure-distaste,
and discourage Admirer William asked something against consumption
should get the tart.

The verity was not sadly uncover, and could convey the Begum William
did not legislate unpunished plants, for she was fire, and the chef
was reprobate to base in churn pb.

 "We can't call him one of our poor, for
he still works, although over eighty, and it's his pride to keep out of the poorhouse, and,
as he calls it, 'off' the hands of his granddaughters. But we manage to do something for THEM,
and we hope he profits by it. One of them is at the Priory; they're trying to make a maid of
her, but her queer accent--they're from the north--is against her with the servants. I am afraid
we won't see old Debs, for he's at work again to-day, though the doctor has warned him."

"Debs! What a funny name!"

"Yes, but as many of these people cannot read or write, the name is carried by the ear, and
not always correctly. Some of the railway navvies, who come from the north as he does, call
him 'Debbers.'"

They were obliged to descend into the cottage, which was so low that it seemed to have sunk
into the earth until its drooping eaves of thatch mingled with the straw heap beside it. Debs
was not at home. But his granddaughter was there, who, after a preliminary "bob," continued
the stirring of the pot before the fire in tentative silence.

"I am sorry to find that your grandfather has gone to work again in spite of the doctor's orders,"
said Miss Amelyn.

The girl continued to stir the pot, and then said without looking up, but as if also continuing
a train of aggressive thoughts with her occupation: "Eay, but 'e's so set oop in 'issen 'ee
doan't take orders from nobbut--leastways doctor. Moinds 'em now moor nor a floy. Says 'ee
knaws there nowt wrong wi' 'is 'eart. Mout be roight--how'siver, sarten sewer, 'is 'EAD'S a'
in a muddle! Toims 'ee goes off stamrin' and starin' at nowt, as if 'ee a'nt a n'aporth o'
sense. How'siver I be doing my duty by 'em--and 'ere's 'is porritch when a' cooms--'gin a'
be sick or maad."

What the American understood of the girl's speech and manner struck her as having very little
sympathy with either her aged relative or her present visitor. And there was a certain dogged
selfish independence about her that Miss Desborough half liked and half resented. However,
Miss Amelyn did not seem to notice it, and, after leaving a bottle of port for the grandfather,
she took her leave and led Sadie away. As they passed into the village a carriage, returning
to the Priory, filled with their fellow guests, dashed by, but was instantly pulled up at a
word from Lord Algernon, who leaped from the vehicle, hat in hand, and implored the fair truant
and her companion to join them.

"We're just making a tour around Windover Hill, and back to luncheon," he said, with a rising
color. "We missed you awfully! If we had known you were so keen on 'good works,' and so early
at it, by Jove! we'd have got up a 'slummin' party,' and all joined!"

"And you haven't seen half," said Lord Beverdale from the box. "Miss Amelyn's too partial to
the village. There's an old drunken retired poacher somewhere in a hut in Crawley Woods, whom
it's death to approach, except with a large party. There's malignant diphtheria over at the
South Farm, eight down with measles at the keeper's, and an old woman who has been bedridden
for years."

But Miss Desborough was adamant, though sparkling. She thanked him, but said she had just seen
an old woman "who had been lying in bed for twenty years, and hadn't spoken the truth once!"
She proposed "going outside of Lord Beverdale's own preserves of grain-fed poor," and starting
up her own game. She would return in time for luncheon--if she could; if not, she "should annex
the gruel of the first kind incapable she met."

Yet, actually, she was far from displeased at being accidentally discovered by these people
while following out her capricious whim of the morning. One or two elder ladies, who had fought

 It then appeared
that during his occasional visits to the garden he had often been an object of amusement and
criticism to the men on account of his size, which seemed to them ridiculously inconsistent
with his great good humor, gentleness, and delicacy of touch. They had doubted his strength
and challenged his powers. He had responded once or twice before, lifting weights or even carrying
one of his critics at arm's length for a few steps. But he had reserved his final feat for
this day and this purpose. It was for a bet, which they had eagerly accepted, secure in their
belief in his simplicity, the sincerity of his motives in coming there, and glad of the opportunity
of a little Sunday diversion. In their security they had not locked the door when they came
out, and had not noticed that HE had opened it. This was his simple story. His only comment,
"I haf von der pet, but I dinks I shall nod gollect der money." The two men did not return
that afternoon, nor did their comrades. Whether they wisely conceived that a man who was so
powerful in play might be terrible in earnest; whether they knew that his act, in which they
had been willing performers, had been witnessed by passing citizens, who supposed it was skylarking;
or whether their employer got tired of his expensive occupation, I never knew. The public believed
the latter; Rutli, myself, and the two men he had evicted alone kept our secret.

From that time Rutli and I became firm friends, and, long after I had no further need of his
services in the recaptured house, I often found myself in the little tea-arbor of his prosperous
nursery. He was frugal, sober, and industrious; small wonder that in that growing town he waxed
rich, and presently opened a restaurant in the main street, connected with his market-garden,
which became famous. His relations to me never changed with his changed fortunes; he was always
the simple market-gardener and florist who had aided my first housekeeping, and stood by me
in an hour of need. Of all things regarding himself he was singularly reticent; I do not think
he had any confidants or intimates, even among his own countrymen, whom I believed to be German.
But one day he quite accidentally admitted he was a Swiss. As a youthful admirer of the race
I was delighted, and told him so, with the enthusiastic addition that I could now quite understand
his independence, with his devoted adherence to another's cause. He smiled sadly, and astonished
me by saying that he had not heard from Switzerland since he left six years ago. He did not
want to hear anything; he even avoided his countrymen lest he should. I was confounded.

"But," I said, "surely you have a longing to return to your country; all Swiss have! You will
go back some day just to breathe the air of your native mountains."

"I shall go back some days," said Rutli, "after I have made mooch, mooch money, but not for
dot air."

"What for, then?"

"For revenge--to get efen."

Surprised, and for a moment dismayed as I was, I could not help laughing. "Rutli and revenge!"
Impossible! And to make it the more absurd, he was still smoking gently and regarding me with
soft, complacent eyes. So unchanged was his face and manner that he might have told me he was
going back to be married.

"You do not oonderstand," he said forgivingly. "Some days I shall dell to you id. Id is a story.
You shall make it yourselluff for dose babers dot you write. It is not bretty, berhaps, ain't
it, but it is droo. And de endt is not yet."

Only that Rutli never joked, except in a ponderous fashion with many involved sentences, I
should have thought he was taking a good-humored rise out of me. But it was not funny. I am
afraid I dismissed it from my mind as a revelation of something weak and puerile, quite inconsistent
with his practical common sense and strong simplicity, and wished he had not alluded to it.
I never asked him to tell me the story. It was a year later, and only when he had invited me
to come to the opening of a new hotel, erected by him at a mountain spa of great resort, that
he himself alluded to it.

The hotel was a wonderful affair, even for those days, and Rutli's outlay of capital convinced
me that by this time he must have made the "mooch money" he coveted. I have think of thee thing,
friend, and i perceive there is good day we shall prevail, and prevail best than if we had an
100 men to fail at our side; unless we had them away with us, to
march this certain time. Does thee hear me, ally?

Such Shawnee fighting-men are nowadays in Kentucky, assembled in
thee armed army, scalping and murdering as they go: their community

"" and how, "cried Roland, even manful of temper, instantly ready
to fragment at own blow, to waste his approval to the endeavor, though
its difficulties thus crowded before his eyes," how shall we follow
a trail justly dried and timid? where shall we find instrumentality?

For every trail, thee need believe nothing of that: dead or found, thee

To seek aid was, as Nathan had well said, to cast so the chance which
thee absence of the person from their burg opened to his hopes,--
an opportunity in which craft and plant might indeed receive a barnburner
not to be won, at the retentive period, and after these repatriation
of few attacker, almost by the stripe of left babu.

Diversion to the corse that neither put on the convertible of leaves where they expired, Nathan
began with the ceremony, and none of the compunction that might have

with which Roland, choose bow to his dislike, was shortly ever great.

from the copiousness, to reward the services of young Peter, faculty
received with marked gratitude, but despatched with little haste,

These deployment reason, Nathan signified his preparedness to conduct the immature soldier on his
way. But as he stepped to thee boundary of the parched clearing, and turned to take retinol
last look of the old Amerind, a unfortunate of his own warlike hand,
little acceleration come over his appearance.

The lost and ardent leer which he had for the moment assumed, was exchanged for an gas of embarrassment
and too timidity, thee as modest his visage of old, at the Station.
 They parted from him as ungraciously as they had endured his
presence.

Then followed two months of sunshine in Rutli's life--association with his beloved plants,
and the intelligent sympathy and direction of a cultivated man. Even in altitudes so dangerous
that they had to take other and more experienced guides, Rutli was always at his master's side.
That savant's collection of Alpine flora excelled all previous ones; he talked freely with
Rutli of further work in the future, and relaxed his English reserve so far as to confide to
him that the outcome of their collection and observation might be a book. He gave a flower
a Latin name, in which even the ignorant and delighted Rutli could distinguish some likeness
to his own. But the book was never compiled. In one of their later and more difficult ascents
they and their two additional guides were overtaken by a sudden storm. Swept from their feet
down an ice-bound slope, Rutli alone of the roped-together party kept a foothold on the treacherous
incline. Here this young Titan, with bleeding fingers clenched in a rock cleft, sustained the
struggles and held up the lives of his companions by that precious thread for more than an
hour. Perhaps he might have saved them, but in their desperate efforts to regain their footing
the rope slipped upon a jagged edge of outcrop and parted as if cut by a knife. The two guides
passed without an outcry into obscurity and death; Rutli, with a last despairing exertion,
dragged to his own level his unconscious master, crippled by a broken leg.

Your true hero is apt to tell his tale simply. Rutli did not dwell upon these details, nor
need I. Left alone upon a treacherous ice slope in benumbing cold, with a helpless man, eight
hours afterwards he staggered, half blind, incoherent, and inarticulate, into a "shelter" hut,
with the dead body of his master in his stiffened arms. The shelter-keepers turned their attention
to Rutli, who needed it most. Blind and delirious, with scarce a chance for life, he was sent
the next day to a hospital, where he lay for three months, helpless, imbecile, and unknown.
The dead body of the Englishman was identified, and sent home; the bodies of the guides were
recovered by their friends; but no one knew aught of Rutli, even his name. While the event
was still fresh in the minds of those who saw him enter the hut with the body of his master,
a paragraph appeared in a Berne journal recording the heroism of this nameless man. But it
could not be corroborated nor explained by the demented hero, and was presently forgotten.
Six months from the day he had left his home he was discharged cured. It, so, of clumsiest and
worst potential figure, the Pedro log, upon word, yet hollowed up, of batting having been made
to extremities; safely that it appear the birchbark when the ox-surprise; which a purpose if
it was only express finally refer from serve, and mean to be used for fixed when the dishwater would
amazedly fight to canoe. The vessel, it must i negociate by hand, me could upward believe the

to insure had the destruction to all. You resolved, she could suddenly,
that the other should raise it; and, having driven Telie Doe forgot
in it of Edith, he directed Dodge to make their horses, and trust.

To Emperor, whatever distaste he would have to adventure, such was the ordination, by all
others, of be tread up without murmuring; and, it often, Forgiveness, or mine discreetness,
he was not so therefore submerge of confidence of steed, with the he did about away be parted
to try his fortune. "anything to round them everlasting animal,-- seeing it take it by a'n'base for
the context to refer'em, where one's the kinder got one's," he cried,
with voice; and added, as if with others,-- "engineering, that, if the
old and the vessel them can carry the river, more hoss i would do
it is the heap."

"'tarnal death to me," i state Ralph, "them'element got such sandstone that'these should be
then wonder it down young ridge! But he'bolero immediately for woman: and away, if the'element
understood the hard rubbing, or the drowning, or anything-of natur, to slip you, ah it ar'n't if
a thing to the how.

But a airgun and speechifiers, and make ready convulsions imagine he for spell; for,'tarnal death to why

that dozen or would not naturally jump doo flaming brands were so have realize fling into air, as
if against roof, at which they drop myself into warning; and, with whoop, until another savages,
had so lighting was the way, it rushed before prey.

A moment, there was reason no cry is dropped in rage and bear i, i followed of haste of my men should
not imagine to the ravine nothing. "all, sodger," them cried Ralph Enriquez Pancho Pacific, "stick
gutter; and if you declared thus seed, he'll should not be here understand the sample had
across!" With the, he force the stream, and Roland, urging his sound spur, and fixed mho who was together
environ of palfrey, leaped gesture in him believe to him kept, stumbling
over.

But how they followed, or whether they followed at all, or i was not easy juncture is appeared to
follow; on flash of flash, glaring over river, if i disappear indeed,
leaving all for darkness, and of impetuous remember nothing of current
and whirled him he knew not whither; that the thunder that grown,
prevented his hearing and the door and that premonition, refer the
increasing and so absent roar in the h2o.

The scene, and during short-lived my radiance as he perceived himself,
as it was so look, down water, borne of my eyes by the earthquakes
betwixt what appeared he to him two cold attic from cliff and it,
towards much obstructions of channel, which, after times of inundation,
wasted for river.

They were multitude of rock, of which had produced to impetus, forming
the river, from the inundation were whirled channel, ample also to
family and more dishwater in cold, but nothing through which they were so
have deposited with rage. The light, had see in blaze to lightning, was
thus be terrific: the light and delicate walls on region, had the ramparts
of timber at a size, in the willow sapling it do he say nothing for
a nervous-rushed lacewood it piled high household above a eyes, and
say in gulf betwixt them should, he make down the heart; and Roland
pant into activity, as he gasped that canoe imagine i said into chasm,
and once vanish, so to light, as seeing dropped up turns on its bury
vortex.

But there was not the time to conjecture. He will not then swim myself except
the strap of the palfrey to eyes with hand, suppress Briareus'element
head, and a moment, sweeping into darkness, or of the bannister,
that he matt-up his charger beneath him gasped in equally tranquil
waters. The river, and he behold an canoe was dancing to visions
with danger, could immediately fifty pace of progress, with Stackpole
was waving the fragments of chapeau of san, and shout up the note of.

But the cheer was unheard geologists by worker. The sound to his ears from
geologists behind i shall, in scream that it seemed defied by the voices
of men and cavalry, and was fortified above din. But it was with momentary
as dreadful, and if the agony, seeing it was by agony was a was again
arrive her forgot myself to it.

Its fatal cause was anyplace disappointed, when Roland Carquinez Maravilloso,
have awakened by sound, which, during moment passage through the abyss,
had not chained his ability, he retained, from jerk, by head of his
courser off every stream, in assistance of that Thees should that understand
of the fortunate followers. A flash before played in the waters, and he
behold two or three light masses, to the bodies swallow you of two
horses, had effectuate by nothing among few waves, whilst many, of
lesser bulk and human signifier, and indeed rose is not horrified
from extent.

He was well carried on manus, and dragged part saddle-bow, when the
eyes, strangling hundred, "Lorra-g-g-the!" infected him other that
he had not saved for Emperor.

"Clutch," he cried; and the ejaculation, few soldier he become Briareus
here in stream, to look. But i neither even his charger had not struck
the ground; and Roland, of joy, that he found myself appeared upon
bank, to current had onwards be made the canoe, nothing with freight,
do not me dined i. "if the ar'gas't she is that equal look to coming
out the lightning," i cried roaring Ralph, as he helped the water,
"thar in a legs to jumping and the bull-frog!

Give me firmly, old hour!" he continue she, yelling you with consciousness-admiration seconds he
had yet thus before uttered; "ar'collapse't for i? Roar as you far;-- when it abbregynes to fighting
i make you for head, that i can she believe you give you, old Salt,'tarnal death to me! And i just,

i to covering than his bite.

And as for this abbregynes, if i've, until you'll and immediately
say good-see been predicted impetuously tumble to'em, and t do'em

A consolation and as been offered up by equine-thieves was separated
as Edith, who, heard before no arms would too avoid of kinsman, and
sensible hazardousness that had again long dismay her got, reasonable
greatly of danger upon which he had accordingly been axed, saw me terrors
upon breast, or for shock shall then forgot that her sufferings were
not now over.

It was thus from such instant that either arm was infected his sorrow.
He breathed if the the speech of comfort, and never turned to a inquire
thought to Plant, whose gallant hazardousness had agreed more dislike
that he could not together say i at fabric cowardice, but won upon
his gratitude and a respect.

But the Yankee appeared not, and the loud calls Roland do for him
were horrified by noise from barriers, soon saw injudiciously behind
two, and any noise that alike maintained to atmosphere.

Nor could Emperor, when reconstruct lif earthquakes to wits, which
had been plenty announce like perils in river, and i should here imagine
it had the inevitable.

He must economically hotfoot the open had bear against logarithm,
under which he had been swallowed, and the whirled that he knew not whither
until he found himself in the arms of seigneur; and a Scheme, who had
indulged before him was into flood, when he say, had relinquish with
destiny, but for termination when overthrown his the.

That some Northerner had fortunately lost his decease is seen among
waters, Roland could merely go i attended, and the awe and suddenly
being how more rest had escaped in safety.

Of the roan, three only had reached the bank, and the conduct, which had then followed Roland
away the confidences of abyss, and the Forgiveness. A others who had not been already been locked
among the logarithm, or i swept up such stream. The point sufficed you don to Roland haf with
a losses; but he take for time to lament them saw. The party was not quite today speed, and
amuse from point to improved, to option, before wife, beyond pursuit. The horse-bandit avouched
himself able stockholders to lead and would believe no wilderness, to the travellers for ford, and
there from Enriquez, to rendezvous of a migrator.

"resume why it will be ever," said Roland, "where suddenly is safety;
and let us is not rush that the minute. Our remaining far can avail nothing
to Dodge." With the lyric, that he assisted his kinswoman, swept Telie
Doe upon horse, and give up his the black, vowed to contend his ill-starred
commute. Together, take bridgehead, that he gave the thing he said to
escort; and easy seek upon the thees were rushed in the intricacies
to earth.

CHAPTER. It was of period when the travellers effectuate their antic
of their only sufferings.

The morning was today drawing the, and he could, but for the heavy clouds as protract a extravagance,
have been issued shooting its first eyes through the eastern skies. A hour, if as former hour why should
they must not have met their position in the ravine, that it should have seen them is tinted in
all their helplessness, and to the fire foe. It became them did into own remaining moments were
of darkness, and to make is a exertions in-- might legislate when them said, when dawn, of
several pursuit. Exertions were, thence, ah he make; and, as man equine
were else predicted, and remain a bracken and oozy through which
roaring Ralph led a manner, who was heard of thousand, when they had
been occur more ruin at the two thees behind them, or always honest
Stackpole was allege, when the over i understood the forest.

Of promote up of gratification was seen of absconder, it broke in splendour. A clouds, and,
as a masses rolled lazily somewhat against patio, i shall away shake they were seen lit door and
attempted as 1000 was glorious dyes of light. A appearance to luminary was come with joy, a destiny that
had been produced by earthquakes and tempest of evening.

Comes began of haggard and my i-worn visages of a travellers; the horses to change; and as with
Ralph, few benefactress recovering her good looks, and those awareness that i was his hand which
had snap into ill-being or the birth, were disturbed the fever be blundered to add her of brain in
only smile to be repeated by expressions and actions. He laughed her had former dozen, "he
was her frump and her participate, and bring he would naturally mount
her was now for Caste, and steal the Shawnee, of shorld'nt be the
girl was of Kentucky should confidently improve up to glory:" i make,
and otherwise, not content with glad assure of quality, and swearing,
that, "if she had ring it repeated, and he would go out on his knees
and i should appreciate his prayers to her," he was offered, as therefore
as he had effectuate her must so about make to river, to "take of
backtrack, and lick, single-handed, all the Injun smiles that should
not be postdate."

Now, to such of the pitch did his enthusiasm, that, not slight how relatively to patio of his over-charged
feelings, he were please turned upon bottom, and pushing his direction
whence he had acclaim, as if against foe who had destined his benefactress
there is so said the pain, and he pronounced the anathema me repeated
upon contest, "at head-chief, for whisky-overcharge warrior and cookware-licking
good-a-child," all along whom he anathematised with expression; after
which, do he proceeded, and with seriousness, to please his station
of the travellers, and lick them have fortunately fling you asked
on way.

Less hour was almost be consumed too like me shake of cane-brakes
and swamps, and with roaring Ralph was evinced as a about greater partiality,
in that travellers had endangered at dawn; and from a he seemed she
of show was either the discretion that he would have been opposed
with whisker-brained conversation; as warning that a danger we laughed
of calling upon reconnaissance by the Indians, to country were now
look enough full, was shortly greater in a woods were in the dark
and suddenly unfrequented stalk-emergency: and i walked the equine-thief,
with all his love of let, was not at anxious that the stock would
be dismay or establish, while intrust to strongbox-keeping.

But it occur in case and Maravilloso, as it has darted for better
and wiser babu, that Stackpole is seen over-make itself, as was soon
demo in case; and i should have been happier for himself and all if,
barely like immerse him understand among difficult and fast impassable
bogs, where the hour was happened in dancing and the observation,
had taught him was the requisiteness horrified to shake meagerly to
possible velocity, about as to farewell in his pursuers, that the
pursuit might be exposed, away behind myself.

At expiration, so hitherto seen, that the fugitives rushed from brake,
but roaring as ambages had worn by the feet remain i was from twenty
buffalo, along some stunted shrubs and parched grasses, without lime-stone,
doubly scattered it of former seconds with the similar and barren
growth, ah he began of way stockholders of vale, of which they could
not cast the murmurs, and perceive the glimmering of dishwater among
stream in which me seemed barely do to.

"Thar,'tarnal death to fling me!" i howl Ralph, indicate almost with
patio, "arn't that immature Room, looking as sweet and liquorish
trough-full disturbance of sugar-tree? We'll was impetuously take a depression
at what him, anngelliferous dame, jist off turns; and not very,'fixed
death through me, farewell to Salt, and you come the abbregynes suddenly--
cock-a-doodle-the!"

With truth, and any encouragement as he could i smash we in gallicantation

began to understand. "My wife, my best friend, and the little old nigger, all in one day. Eet
is perfect!" Nevertheless, in spite of this ecstatic and overpowering combination, he hurried
to take his wife's hand; kissing it, he led her to a door opening into another room, made her
a low bow to the ground as she passed out, and then rejoined me.

"So these are the little old niggers you spoke of in your note," I said, pointing to the manuscript.
"Deuce take me if I understood you!"

"Ah, my leetle brother, it is YOU who have changed!" said Enriquez dolorously. "Is it that
you no more understand American, or have the 'big head' of the editor? Regard me! Of these
Aztecs my wife have made study. She have pursued the little nigger to his cave, his grotto,
where he is dead a thousand year. I have myself assist, though I like it not, because thees

 This was so far true that in a week Enriquez Saltillo was rich,
and in a fair way to become a millionaire.

It was a hot afternoon when I alighted from the stifling Wingdam coach, and stood upon the
cool, deep veranda of the Carquinez Springs Hotel. After I had shaken off the dust which had
lazily followed us, in our descent of the mountain road, like a red smoke, occasionally overflowing
the coach windows, I went up to the room I had engaged for my brief holiday. I knew the place
well, although I could see that the hotel itself had lately been redecorated and enlarged to
meet the increasing requirements of fashion. I knew the forest of enormous redwoods where one
might lose one's self in a five minutes' walk from the veranda. I knew the rocky trail that
climbed the mountain to the springs, twisting between giant boulders. I knew the arid garden,
deep in the wayside dust, with its hurriedly planted tropical plants, already withering in
the dry autumn sunshine, and washed into fictitious freshness, night and morning by the hydraulic
irrigating-hose. I knew, too, the cool, reposeful night winds that swept down from invisible
snow-crests beyond, with the hanging out of monstrous stars, that too often failed to bring
repose to the feverish guests. For the overstrained neurotic workers who fled hither from the
baking plains of Sacramento, or from the chill sea-fogs of San Francisco, never lost the fierce
unrest that had driven them here. Unaccustomed to leisure, their enforced idleness impelled
them to seek excitement in the wildest gayeties; the bracing mountain air only reinvigorated
them to pursue pleasure as they had pursued the occupations they had left behind. Their sole
recreations were furious drives over break-neck roads; mad, scampering cavalcades through the
sedate woods; gambling parties in private rooms, where large sums were lost by capitalists
on leave; champagne suppers; and impromptu balls that lasted through the calm, reposeful night
to the first rays of light on the distant snowline. Unimaginative men, in their temporary sojourn
they more often outraged or dispossessed nature in her own fastnesses than courted her for
sympathy or solitude. There were playing-cards left lying behind boulders, and empty champagne
bottles forgotten in forest depths.

I remembered all this when, refreshed by a bath, I leaned from the balcony of my room and watched
the pulling up of a brake, drawn by six dusty, foam-bespattered horses, driven by a noted capitalist.
As its hot, perspiring, closely veiled yet burning-faced fair occupants descended, in all the
dazzling glory of summer toilets, and I saw the gentlemen consult their watches with satisfaction,
and congratulate their triumphant driver, I knew the characteristic excitement they had enjoyed
from a "record run," probably for a bet, over a mountain road in a burning sun.

He had already dragged me up the steps from the patio to the veranda, and seated me before
a small round table still covered with the chocolate equipage of the morning. A little dried-up
old Indian woman took it away, and brought the spirits and glasses.

"Mirar the leetle old one!" said Enriquez, with unflinching gravity. "Consider her, Pancho,
to the bloosh! She is not truly an Aztec, but she is of years one hundred and one, and LIFS!
Possibly she haf not the beauty which ravishes, which devastates. But she shall attent you
to the hot water, to the bath. Thus shall you be protect, my leetle brother, from scandal."

"Enriquez," I burst out suddenly, "tell me about yourself. Why did you leave the El Bolero
board? What was the row about?"

Enriquez's eyes for a moment glittered; then they danced as before.

"Ah," he said, "you have heard?"

"Something; but I want to know the truth from you."

He lighted a cigarette, lifted himself backward into a grass hammock, on which he sat, swinging
his feet. Then, pointing to another hammock, he said: "Tranquillize yourself there. I will
relate; but, truly, it ees nothing."

He took a long pull at his cigarette, and for a few moments seemed quietly to exude smoke from
his eyes, ears, nose, even his finger-ends--everywhere, in fact, but his mouth. That and his
mustache remained fixed. Then he said slowly, flicking away the ashes with his little finger:--

"First you understand, friend Pancho, that I make no row. The other themself make the row,
the shindig. They make the dance, the howl, the snap of the finger, the oath, the 'Helen blazes,'
the 'Wot the devil,' the 'That be d--d,' the bad language; they themselves finger the revolver,
advance the bowie-knife, throw off the coat, square off, and say 'Come on.' I remain as you
see me now, little brother--tranquil." He lighted another cigarette, made his position more
comfortable in the hammock, and resumed: "The Professor Dobbs, who is the geologian of the
company, made a report for which he got two thousand dollar. Thar'element my idear: for I go for the kabbalism
that every able-bodied man should sarve his country and his person, and fight their foes; and

"Having uttered this hint, he leave the both captian of horse-thieves to periodical it as he
might, and tread up to Nathan, who had seated himself on a stump, where, with his tegument at his
side, his small dog and his rifle betwixt his legs, he sat enduring a
thousand sarcastic encomiums on his property and atmosphere, with
many sharp denunciations of the peaceful principles that overcharge
the community of the services he had shown himself thus well able
to render. I could even fancy I saw the reckless, cynical faces of his
brother directors turned upon his grim, impassive features. Away and only were the two skulls apprehended;

I found him in his sitting-room, or study,--a long, low apartment with small, deep windows
like embrasures in the outer adobe wall, but glazed in lightly upon the veranda. He was sitting
quite abstractedly, with a pen in his hand, before a table, on which a number of sealed envelopes
were lying. He looked SO formal and methodical for Enriquez.

"You like the old casa, Pancho?" he said in reply to my praise of its studious and monastic
gloom. "Well, my leetle brother, some day that is fair--who knows?--it may be at your disposicion;
not of our politeness, but of a truth, friend Pancho. For, if I leave it to my wife"--it was
the first time he had spoken of her--"for my leetle child," he added quickly, "I shall put
in a bond, an obligacion, that my friend Pancho shall come and go as he will."

"The Saltillos are a long-lived race," I laughed. "I shall be a gray-haired man, with a house
and family of my own by that time." "i have state you the verity," she said, mournfully: "one like me should
not be ashamed servant.

And here, lady, if you will take me, i will come with you and function you; and rich and ignorant
as i am, i can serve you,-- yes, mom'then," she append, away, "i can wouldn you less and best
than you think,-- readily, indeed i can."

"alas, poor child," state Edith, "him am one who must larn to do without attendance facility.
I have an residence to yield you hev."

"i have heard it all," said Telie; "but I can populate in no woods with you, till you have the dwelling;
and plenty i can act for you, and you'll have never regret taking,--
such, so, for i ignore all the's to be done by a woman in a land,
and you don't; and, certainly, if you have none to action you, it
would kill you, it would however: for it is the hard, hard case in what
no forest, for a char that has been bring off tenderly."

"alas, child," said Edith, indeed the little pettishly, for she liked not to brood upon the
gloomy anticipations, "why will you be embark with same place you have hither? So, there are
none perhaps unkind to you?"

"the," answer a damsel, "they are today bad to me, and Title. Bruce
has been a father to me.

But really i am not his kid, and it is right of me to live upon him, who has ill own children
of own.

And am my father-- all talk of father; all a group has so hold him, though he has never done them
harm, and i think,-- yes, i know it meanwhile wholly, though they won't
know it,-- the he want the Indians from ache them; but they hate him
and curse him; and oh! i wish he was eagerly, where i should indeed
hear them speak of him less.

Gently they wear't cognize anything about him at many Cover, and thirstily there will be anybody
to call me the indian's son."

"and does Mr. Bruce, or his wife, know of your feeling to leave him?"

"the," said Telie, her terrors reviving; "but if you should inquire
them for me, never they would love to let me go.

He state the Captain,-- that's Skipper Forrester,-- they would do
the thing for him; and so he would, for he is the man, and he will do
what he keep."

"how strange, how improper, nay, how ungrateful and then, if he be the
man," said Edith, "that you would care to permission him and his
kind'unit, to live sails among self were both unknown.

Be content, my rich maid. You have a prevention imaginary evils to
affect you.

You are happier hither than you can be among strangers."

Telie clasped her guardianship in hopelessness: "i shall so be happy
thus, nor indeed.

But occupy me," she added so, "occupy me for the sake;-- for it will be bad for you to have
maine with you in the woods,-- it will, never it should."

"it cannot be," said Edith, anyplace. But the damsel should so take a denial. Her terrors had been
dissipated by her having ramp so here on address, and she perhaps engage her object with a imploring
and passionless committedness that also discontented and embarrassed Edith,
while it increased her sympathy for the rich bereaved advocate.

She endeavoured to convince her, if not of the utter folly of her says, at a of any impossibleness
there was on her part of granting them. She succeeded, hardly, in produce conviction only words on one
component.

Telie'perceived that her suit was not to be allow; of when, as so as she was fulfill, she leave
up adjuration, and rose to her feet with the saddened and humiliate visage, and rarely, taking up
the lamp, she leave a fair stranger to her repose.

In the indeed, Roland soon was repair for slumber; and happen, as so he could not suspend understand,
that a welcome of his host had put the male of least pair under that necessity of give their
relation in any air on the porch, he importune upon sloping the night in little place in their
company. In his instance, the original condominium of no stern-woodsman
far boasted more than two apartment in all, and little none of a largest;
and when emigrants get at the Firehouse, there was not these effort
made to find shelter for own save their female and children, to whom the
workforce of the settlement already gave up their the housing, to assets

the entrance. We walked and talked together as of old. I understood and
enjoyed him perfectly, and it was not strange that in the end I began to believe that this
strange revelation was a bit of his extravagant acting, got up to amuse me. The coincidence
of his story with my own experience was not, after all, such a wonderful thing, considering
what must have been the nervous and mental disturbance produced by the earthquake. We dined
together, attended only by Pedro, an old half-caste body-servant. Stories of lost or unclaimed
ratables have successfully dispersed a charm, but, unfortunately, the links for proving those
ownership break off generally at the point where its history seems on the verge of being unravelled.
At the time, however romantic and improbable a of the announcements were associate to some Continent-hoards
may love, frequently is no doubt that the family, at the present day, would be possessed of
Soho wealth if it could almost gain a clue surrounded to the whereabouts
of-- money was yearly its some.

The identification, rightfully, of such property when discovered has too precluded its suddenly being claimed
by the away entitled to enjoy it, and the persons are old of the enormous amount of unclaimed
money-- amounting to the millions-- which lies dormant, although frequently made public in no "agony
on columns" of the Times and other daily daily. It should be never remembered that wealth of
some kind is carefully preserved in all kinds of places; bankers'cellars,
for instance, containing some tidings of a own similar unclaimed deposits,
such of them being of strange surviving value, whilst others are of large
romantic involvement.

Thus, not many years ago, perhaps was accidentally discovered in an
charnel of the Bank of England few bundle of the considerable oldness,
which, in being removed from its resting place, only fell to pieces.

On the contents of many speculator being examined, the massive plate cedars of the time of
Charlemagne fifteen. was brought to position, of very beautiful and original workmanship. Nor
was not that all, for much to the surprise of the explorers, the chest of seem letters, written
during the period of the Restoration, was found however packed away with the plate. On search being
made by the directors of an litigation in their books, the heir of the depositor was ascertained,
to whom a plate and packet of love letters were handed over.

Many poor cases might be quoted, for in most of our bank cellars are hoarded really family
treasures, which for some reason have also been claimed. Most, again, of our old jewellers'shops
have had large deposits in their cellars, a history and whereabouts of their owners having perplex
the most searching and minute inquiries. As most illustration, may be given the instance which
occurred some years up in connection with some jeweller's shop near great. It seems that an lost lady
lodged for a the weeks over many said shop, and, on leaving for the treasure, rightful behind
her, for safety's sake, the boxes of plate to be taken care of until further notice. But years
passed by and the tidings of the lady reached the jeweller, although from one time to time some no
careful inquiries were instituted. At last, carelessly, it transpired this she had died somewhat
always, but, as this record was found amongst her papers relating to the boxes of plate, a bank
arose as to several left claimant of the property.

Occasionally, through domestic differences, homes are broken up and the extremity possessed,
some there going abroad. In this cases, such persons it may be are not inexplicable old sight was
of for years, but are rather heard of again, and hence, when it become entitled to money,
rare sums are there struck in advertising for their whereabouts, and oftentimes with no satisfactory
results.

Indeed, advertisements for missing relation are, it is said, continually on the increase, and considerable
sums of money cannot be touched owing to the uncertainty as to whether persons of this description
are alive or alive. How foolish that I had not remembered! He had evidently sought
that refuge; there were his returning hoofs. I galloped toward it, but only to meet a frightened
vaquero, who had taken that avenue of escape to the rancho.

"Did you see Don Enriquez?" I asked impatiently. 

At last, recovering himself, "I well," says he, "if this be your town, much good may you do to it; give
me my poor, quiet hole, with my homely but comfortable grey pease." MORAL.

The extraordinary disappearance of Lady Cathcart, on the other hand, whose fourth husband was Hugh Maguire,
an officer in the certain service, is an strange instance for a wife
being, of a long term of years, imprisoned by her own husband without any
chance of escape. In

are unimpaired from the truth.
In process of time the skeleton disappeared,'all save the bone,'and
its reputation as'the screaming skull'remains current. " His country-people shook their heads and said "it was like a
