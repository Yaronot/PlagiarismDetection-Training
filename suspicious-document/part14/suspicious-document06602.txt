So far I have discussed only the possibility of divorce without offences, the sort of divorce
that arises out of estrangement and incompatibilities. But divorce, as it is known in most
Christian countries, has a punitive element, and is obtained through the failure of one of
the parties to observe the conditions of the bond and the determination of the other to exact
suffering. Divorce as it exists at present is not a readjustment but a revenge. It is the nasty
exposure of a private wrong. In England a husband may divorce his wife for a single act of
infidelity, and there can be little doubt that we are on the eve of an equalisation of the
law in this respect. I will confess I consider this an extreme concession to the passion of
jealousy, and one likely to tear off the roof from many a family of innocent children. Only
infidelity leading to supposititious children in the case of the wife, or infidelity obstinately
and offensively persisted in or endangering health in the case of the husband, really injure
the home sufficiently to justify a divorce on the assumptions of our present argument. If we
are going to make the welfare of the children our criterion in these matters, then our divorce
law does in this direction already go too far. A husband or wife may do far more injury to
the home by constantly neglecting it for the companionship of some outside person with whom
no "matrimonial offence" is ever committed. Of course, if our divorce law exists mainly for
the gratification of the fiercer sexual resentments, well and good, but if that is so, let
us abandon our pretence that marriage is an institution for the establishment and protection
of homes. And while on the one hand existing divorce laws appear to be obsessed by sexual offences,
other things of far more evil effect upon the home go without a remedy. There are, for example,
desertion, domestic neglect, cruelty to the children drunkenness or harmful drug-taking, indecency
of living and uncontrollable extravagance. I cannot conceive how any logical mind, having once
admitted the principle of divorce, can hesitate at making these entirely home-wrecking things
the basis of effective pleas. But in another direction, some strain of sentimentality in my
nature makes me hesitate to go with the great majority of divorce law reformers. I cannot bring
myself to agree that either a long term of imprisonment or the misfortune of insanity should
in itself justify a divorce. I admit the social convenience, but I wince at the thought of
those tragic returns of the dispossessed. So far as insanity goes, I perceive that the cruelty
of the law would but endorse the cruelty of nature. But I do not like men to endorse the cruelty
of nature.

And, of course, there is no decent-minded person nowadays but wants to put an end to that ugly
blot upon our civilisation, the publication of whatever is most spicy and painful in divorce
court proceedings. It is an outrage which falls even more heavily on the innocent than on the
guilty, and which has deterred hundreds of shy and delicate-minded people from seeking legal
remedies for nearly intolerable wrongs. The sort of person who goes willingly to the divorce
court to-day is the sort of person who would love a screaming quarrel in a crowded street.
The emotional breach of the marriage bond is as private an affair as its consummation, and
it would be nearly as righteous to subject young couples about to marry to a blustering cross-examination
by some underbred bully of a barrister upon their motives, and then to publish whatever chance
phrases in their answers appeared to be amusing in the press, as it is to publish contemporary
divorce proceedings. The thing is a nastiness, a stream of social contagion and an extreme
cruelty, and there can be no doubt that whatever other result this British Royal Commission
may have, there at least will be many sweeping alterations.

THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE EMPIRE

Sec. 1

"If Youth but Knew" is the title of a book published some years ago, but still with a quite
living interest, by "Kappa"; it is the bitter complaint of a distressed senior against our
educational system. He is hugely disappointed in the public-school boy, and more particularly
in one typical specimen. He is--if one might hazard a guess--an uncle bereft of great expectations.
He finds an echo in thousands of other distressed uncles and parents. They use the most divergent
and inadequate forms of expression for this vague sense that the result has not come out good
enough; they put it contradictorily and often wrongly, but the sense is widespread and real
and justifiable and we owe a great debt to "Kappa" for an accurate diagnosis of what in the
aggregate amounts to a grave national and social evil.

The trouble with "Kappa's" particular public-school boy is his unlit imagination, the apathetic
commonness of his attitude to life at large. He is almost stupidly not interested in the mysteries
of material fact, nor in the riddles and great dramatic movements of history, indifferent to
any form of beauty, and pedantically devoted to the pettiness of games and clothing and social
conduct. It is, in fact, chiefly by his style in these latter things, his extensive unilluminated
knowledge of Greek and Latin, and his greater costliness, that he differs from a young carpenter
or clerk. A young carpenter or clerk of the same temperament would have no narrower prejudices
nor outlook, no less capacity for the discussion of broad questions and for imaginative thinking. Application

You couldn't have everything, after all. fabric-nape and terrapin and wine patients; at you talk down

All this Rubric. Zero, her ignore she matt-up; but he notice partly that she had been perturbed,

if it were she who had disgraced herself? The childless family and the small family would pay equally with the large family,
incomes being equal, but they would receive in proportions varying with the health and general
quality of their children. That, I think, gives the broad principles upon which the payments
would be made.

Of course, if these subsidies resulted in too rapid a rise in the birth-rate, it would be practicable
to diminish the inducement; and if, on the other hand, the birth-rate still fell, it would
be easy to increase the inducement until it sufficed.

That concisely is the idea of the Endowment of Motherhood. I believe firmly that some such
arrangement is absolutely necessary to the continuous development of the modern State. These
proposals arise so obviously out of the needs of our time that I cannot understand any really
intelligent opposition to them. He had come to America with missive of recommendation. Son-in-law,

 So that a doctor who has no religious passion
for poverty and self-devotion gets through the minimum of training and learning as quickly
and as cheaply as possible, and does all he can to fill up the rest of his time in passing
rapidly from case to case. But, as it was as the rules of code why a son should always allude out

There are no public specialists to whom he can conveniently refer the difficulties he constantly
