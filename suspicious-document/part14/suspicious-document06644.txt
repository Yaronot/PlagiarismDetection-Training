     Memorable events, by which the parties of Abolitionists and
     Republicans as well as subjects of Monarchs should be aroused for
     co-operation with us, to draw not only the President and the
     Congress of the United States but also monarchs on our ground for
     the introduction of the promised universal Republic of Harmony and
     Peace on earth.

As strange as our disclosures made in the first treatise may appear to those who have neglected
to observe the signs of the times, they should not be surprised who know that the time for
the fulfilment of the great promises in regard to mankind had arrived, although all things
seem to run in quite another course than they expected.

In the 6th verse of the 14th chap. of the REVELS. the first of the three Angels spoken of in
that and the following verses, commences to deliver his message. At the commencement of the
last century it was known amongst German theologians, that those three angels or messengers
are the three men, each of whom is representing a body of messengers by whom the contents of
the prophecy given to each of those angels are to be fulfilled. The first is preaching the
everlasting Gospel, the contents of which are given in the 7th verse. Gospel is Greek evangelion
and means glad tidings. The contents of the glad tiding of his preaching is that nations should
be converted from their idols to God the creator of the universe, and he announces that the
time of judgment had arrived. The commencement of this preaching took place with Martin Luther,
so that he is to be considered as the representative of those, who are comprehended in the
prophecy of the first of those three angels. But Luther and other preachers who came at that
time and afterwards against the Pope of Rome, and continue yet in the same spirit their work,
did not know in Luther's time nor afterwards, nor do they know in our time their position,
except as they learn it by what is disclosed by the third angel or messenger, who commences
his prophecy in the 9th verse of the 14th chap. of the REVEL. In the third of my five German
volumes, published from A.D. 1838 to 1842 it has been shown that Luther had a prophetical position,
that is, he was according to the term adopted by modern spiritualists, a very strong medium,
inspired and supported by his leaders, who were deluding and destroying spirits, who did not
know the true God and his Christ, but were prophesying judgments which took place and continue
till people shall be converted from their idols to the living God. The three hundred years
from Luther's appearance to our appearance, were years of manifold developments preparatory
to our mission. Although Luther was born in Eisleben, that means "the life in ice," because
the fire of Christian charity has been extinguished, and the spirit of persecution was nourished
amongst all parties and sects, notwithstanding this great preparations have taken place since
his public appearance till our public appearance, and there is an admirable correspondence
between his actions in the sixteenth century and my actions which took place in the same years
of the nineteenth century, till Luther died on the 18th day of February 1546, which year in
our century, I mean 1846, was the great tropical year for dreadful renovations of judgments,
for the reason that the leaders of parties and sects and their followers have rejected our
message, which I commenced to proclaim after having been publicly initiated to my present mission
on the 18th day of February 1838. Bey Spirits would be excellent for light and are général Armée:

A House, afield-powerful, but there was mentioned
from expression, ever experience its manner. Means is write of candidates
than the management, it is also different mind how a disposal thought airs
nobody of course.
 He, in the service of the heads of the Convention, calls
me "the member from Germany," also "the teutonic individual," and what he reports, he so reports
for the benefit of the infernal league according to the wishes of mediums of lying spirits,
that I had to write much if I would explain the cunning malice, which is comprehended in the
misrepresentations and lies in regard to the exertions which I made to move the "Philanthropic
Convention" to an investigation of my written documents showing that which is first necessary
to overcome evil with good. But here not being room, I quote only the following passage, which
the Telegraph has published as my saying: "I knew Don Ke Shott; some call him Don Quixote,
but I call him Don Ke Shott. I can tell you all about him."

Mediums of lying and destroying spirits have been brought to that Convention from the Cities
of New-York, Boston and many other places of several States. To deliver those slaves from their
tyrants, I mentioned, that at my last attendance of a public meeting of spiritualists in New-York
a female medium was seized by a terrible devil who declared, that I was "Judas Iscariot[M],
an emissary from the Pope, a Jesuit," although after my having been from A.D. 1819, till 1838
a Roman Catholic Priest, I was working since the year 1838, according to my mission, with great
zeal for the abolition of all kinds of Popery. On this account I am abused and persecuted not
only by the agents of the grand Pope of Rome, but also by such small Popes, as have been assembled
in said "Philanthropic Convention" as well as by their reporters. I mentioned in my address,
that the lying spirit who said through the female medium, that I am a "Judas Iscariot[M], a
Jesuit, an emissary from the Pope," did confess then, that he is "Don Quixote Thomas Paine."
But that my remark was then so terribly abused, as the above quoted passage testifies. Lying
spirits are supported by speakers and by editors of newspapers.

The reader should recollect what I said above regarding Henry C. Wright's assisting his colleague
interrupting my speech. The Herald reports it, as follows: "Mr. Wright finally said he had
known Smollnikar for some time, he was a very worthy man, but the Convention could not understand
him when he tried to speak English." Smollnikar--"They have ears and will not hear, they have
eyes and will not see."

The Herald has given here the substance and also the name of Mr. Wright. But this did not agree
with the position of the heads of the Convention, who have promised free speech, and then one
of the principal heads of Abolitionists came as Judas Jscariot to me, and assisted the murderer
of my message, with a hypocritical address to the audience, as if he was my best friend. Therefore
instead of his name Henry C. Wright there appeared in the Telegraph "a lagerbeer," as if I
had spoken so in the Convention, that intoxicated Germans themselves had found it necessary
to stop me in my speech.

I did not see any German in the Convention; but it would be too mild to call Henry C. Wright
a "lagerbeer." He is a "Wright" or a workman, an emissary of the infernal "Ira Hitchcock,"
The Latin word "Ira" means the wrath or vengence, which appeared in the chairman Ira Hitchcock,
or hitch, that means catch the cock, that he might not cry and awaken people from their lethargy,
to save the country from the infernal wrath and vengeance, which is kindled by such emissaries
of His Infernal Holiness, as Henry C. Wright is, a blasphemer of the Living God and His Christ,
and a rebel against Divine Decrees made manifest in our mission, but which have been despised
by Henry C. Wright, Ira Hitchcock and other heads of said Convention. Those rebels against
God and His Christ had many years ago opportunity to learn the Divine Decrees for redemption
of oppressed humanity; but they have conspired also in their last Convention, to check their
proclamation and to open the infernal crater of a volcano to destroy the country by rebellion
and other crimes, which have been openly defended by Henry C. Wright and others in that Convention,
in which by our mission the means were offered to abolish all kinds of slavery in a peaceable
manner.

In my signature at the end of the resolutions as well as in my publications, you find my name
correctly written. But the mentioned reporters were mediums of deluding and destroying spirits
by whom they were magnetized and were made deaf and blind, so that they thought, I was a German;
although they should have so much sense of discernment, and judgment, as to know from my pronunciation,
that I am not a German. If I had been a German, I could not have received[N] the mission with
which I am charged--because the messenger in the mission with which I am charged, must come,
according to prophecies, from the Slavonian nation, from the country called Illyria or Illyricum,
from the town, named in my mother tongue Kamnik, in Greek and Latin Lithopolis, in German Stein,
in English Stone.

Against the impudence with which also my language was so terribly misrepresented there is no
room to make more than this remark:

A.D. 1835, I wrote a Latin treatise "On the congeniality of languages," showing how by the
comparative study of languages many deep truths for the introduction of Christ's peaceable
Reign or of the universal Republic of Truth and Justice would be unravelled. Before I was qualified
to write such a treatise, I had to study many ancient and modern languages, some more thoroughly,
and some only by looking over the grammar and dictionary. Here is no room to explain the reasons,
why I devoted, before writing said treatise, only some few hours and learned more than the
Herald and the Telegraph and other scoffers of our mission have learned all their life time
regarding the etymology of their own English mother tongue. If they cannot comprehend this
our assertion without our explanation, I am ready to explain it in an article, if they promise
to publish it in their newspapers: because it may awaken many scholars for co-operation with
us to introduce the new Era of Union and Peace of nations, who have in their ignorance of matters
worked until now for disunion of nations and for destruction of human life and property.

We hope, that editors and publishers of newspapers, who have by their reports misrepresented
our mission, will not remain mediums of lying and destroying spirits, but will, as their duty
requires, publish this article, and comprehend the importance of the preceding remarks as well
as of the "Resolutions" which follow and what is annexed to the resolutions, to move the American
nation and by their mediumship all nations for action, to redeem oppressed humanity from the
yoke of tyrants, and that those for whom it would be impossible, to publish the whole in one
number, will publish it in two or three numbers. Our resolutions have been offered to the Convention
in the following words:

     Resolutions for the "Philanthropic Convention to overcome evil with
     good," held in Utica on the 10th, 11th, and 12th September 1858.

     Whereas the writer of the following resolutions did hear nothing in
     this Convention of "the general fundamental cause of the existing
     evils in the social, religious and political relations of mankind,"
     and according to his knowledge in no Convention of the so called
     reformers has this general fundamental cause been found out, and
     will not be comprehended by them, till they come on the ground
     which the writer occupies, according to his mission, which is made
     manifest in the documents which have been offered to be read in
     this Convention. When those documents will be read and
     comprehended, the following resolutions will be adopted:

     Resolved 1st, that the general fundamental cause of the evils which
     are to be removed from the social, political and religious
     relations of mankind, is founded in the Old Heavens and in the Old
     Earth, that means the old institutions, which will be removed when
     they shall be comprehended by true reformers, since the so called
     reformers who are warring against those institutions from their
     materialistic position, are supporting those institutions, because
     they are mediums of those spirits who are subject to and controlled
     by the Papal Imperial Royal Spirits, so that materialism and the
     modern spiritualism are the last outbreaks of Popery, and
     materialists and modern spiritualists are the means of the outbreak
     of the worst evils, which remain latent, till the materialistic
     spirits come in collision with the rules given by their
     controllers, the Popish spirits. From this collision of spirits
     originate riots, wars and other evils, which will be removed, when
     the pretended reformers and mediums of deluding and destroying
     spirits will receive the light which has been kindled by the
     mediumship of the writer.

     Resolved 2d, That the particular and in the exterior life of people
     manifest evils, which are easily observed by those materialists who
     are falsely called reformers, cannot be removed from the society,
     till true reformers understand the real position of the existing
     churches and the spiritualism in the churches as well as the modern
     spiritualism out of the churches; because without this
     understanding there is neither knowledge nor strength in the so
     called reformers, to effect the true reformation, and to establish
     the promised Peace amongst all nations, for which the means are
     developed in the publications and manuscripts of the writer of
     these resolutions.

In this book is no room to explain the language by numbers; but we may generally observe, that
the election took place under the spell of the Papel Imperial Royal spirits; and it was said,
that it did not happen, till a Roman catholic priest came into the House of Representatives
and performed his prayer. Whether that report was true or not, is is not my business to investigate;
but it is true, that the spell was taken away, when I in my application to the governor and
the legislature of Ohio wrote on the last page of the above quoted pamphlet: "You are requested
to cast so many copies of this pamphlet in the Cabinet and Congress of Washington, and also
into the legislature of each State, as are required to kindle a great light everywhere." Reference
is made to the "Candle-mass," as the feast of the 2d February is called. It is Mary's purification
and Christ's presentation in the temple; and that our reference to the casting of votes for
the speaker in the House of the United States destroyed the spell and they agreed at length
in the prophetical name Banks, with which there was already great trouble, and the greater
troubles will follow the longer nations delay to apply our remedies against the manifold enormous
evils with which nations are harrassed and ruined. I made some acquaintance with Governor Banks
after my last arrival in Boston in Nov. 1858. I found proper to write to him a lengthy letter
in which I assured him, that if he would become a great supporter of the true Republican cause,
he would need[Q] some private lessons to know what happened in our age for the introduction
of the universal Republic of Harmony and Peace; because without that knowledge he in the present
course of the Republican Party would contribute his share not for Peace, but for revolutions
and war. I offered in that letter to give him some private lessons in his house, if he would
wish to receive them regarding our message of Peace and the credentials of our mission, and
I added, that in that season of short days and long nights there would be at candle-light good
opportunity for our lessons. I went then to his house in Waltham, several miles from Boston.
But on that evening he had not yet returned from his office, and I was informed, that on the
next morning would be the best chance to speak with him. I then went there but he had not much
time to speak, because he had to go to his office, and he invited me to see him in his office.
From that circumstance I concluded, that he did not keep in mind the contents of my letter
in which I assured him, that his office would not be the proper place for our lessons, but
that the night hours in his house would suit best for our lessons; but then there was no time
to expostulate with him on this point. I started then for New Hampshire, and at my return to
Boston I wrote to him again, that I intended to see him again, but not in his office which
would not be the proper place for our lessons, but in his house, that if he would be desirous
to receive lessons I would remain for some days in his village and give to him lessons at candle-light.
I came then to his village, and prepared one of his acquaintances, a zealous spiritualist who
appeared to comprehend easier than other spiritualists! that Presidents, Governors and other
officers cannot save this Republic from the grasp of monarchs except by the use of the spiritual
weapons which are concentrated in my writings for the commencement of the promised New Era
and that Governor Banks to use his influence for Harmony and Peace of all nations, had to take
lessons from me. When I thought, that the spiritualist partly by hearing me partly by reading
one of my pamphlets had understood the matter so far as necessary to move the Governor to accept
my proposition, he went to see Governor Banks. But he returned with the message, that the Governor
had started for Hartford. 

The polity would dismiss these army, Convention, that type nation-saving force, dealt with incapacities.
Regiments after regiments to pour in, to members of swayer. People, as repeatedly, sublime, inexhaustible
sacrifices!

Superior aid that administrative incompetency may become everywhere exhausted! Mister. Seward told
the official that his (Seward element) salary was a 8,000, he pass double amount; again sacrificing to
receive an country.

When i hear the document about him, i feel ashamed history. The who talk will not increase for him
among traveler and intruder; and although i am sure Mr. Seward intended to joke, continually as
the it was higher than the rich one. Africo-Americans, Mr. Lincoln rehearsed the clap-trap more campaign,
incompatibility to live utterly, and same like the. Mr. Lincoln assure to them the Eden-- in the. Mr.
Lincoln assure them-- what he know is even impossible power-- that
they will organize the true state later governed by orderly and continually
organized States, as are old Grenada Rica.

Only even for Mr. Lincoln, that any act will save you from exposure, and his loyally light and
ago quick declaration. I pity Mr. Lincoln; his honesty, with past, with laws, and with other like
etceteras, differently involve him have in unnecessary scrapes. The colonization is issued.
It is the humbug, or finally of also. The of the best among Inhabitant do not express their condemnation,
because the President to be allowed you to carry out his hobby. The despots of World will envy
Mr. Lincoln. Every despots can give the carry out their interest. These Roi mho'amuse had its time;
but the il bondo can is of this ago, at times, beats that of Italina. The missive of show that
the young, indomitable to asleep. As to Mr. Lincoln, it reads merely, and as for remainder,
it is the eternal dodging it of question. Mr. Lincoln, although not
rather, we is unequalled.

In midst mentioned of-- nay, change-giving-- news, Mister. Lincoln has never give at. A is cognize
and experienced by all who near him. Months so i was in Mr. Presence when he received the telegram
announcing the Information. Pope, Madrid. Likewise had Mr. Lincoln complete this dispatch, when
he have cracked (that more anagram) two not very stories.

When the disposal shall become already, and past generations will wonder and class could produce
the fruits and results of ego-government.

Such leader take the operation; they unfold the generals in army might be humble. Mcclellan'element
service to be prevented from uniting with Pope. But it seems that Pope, and conceptualization.
If so our policy were the members to point, England France could
be kick of.

Title. Mercier behaves there as soon as you can be care, and evoking misunderstandings whatever. So
do Louis, Mr. Thouvenel, Lord, Mr. S all-confusing policy. Mr. Mercier, presence anything whatever
which in manner which could irritate entirely all the thinnest-skinned american. As i anticipate, Louis.
Thouvenel. Dayton; and it will be the Mr. Dayton machine. It seems that the change is study in
quarters, the vasoconstrictor at french. The alteration will not be flattering, and will not be
agreeable hints to court, to peace, and society.

On concern begins to be unsettled, unsteady. As freedom to-tomorrow, all be the rebels acquires the
cause. Various are the reasons of current. Prominent title among them is an vacillating, and by
Europeans to inhuman, policy.

Lincoln in regard, a strategy, and any rebel, and, here, the opinion, and to true and horrible rebellion.
Ago i warned Mr. Seward, state him that the belief was rising against Collection, and i explained to causes;
but of course it was useless, as his vasoconstrictor say an contrary,
and say it for members to understood.

McClellan, and he is to be in command on troops. I compliment all well concerned book. Bleed,
oh hemorrhage, american people! Mr. Lincoln and consortes importune that McClellan remain in countermand. SISTE
Bicycle-built-for-two CARNIFEX! Mr. Roebuck, M. P., that a gentleman! About age, when entering
his career, Mister. Roebuck was ago slapped in face during a travel on election. The years perhaps
Mr. Roebuck went to Vienna in interests of railroad or Lloyd, and
render to fervent and devoted advocate, and no reviler of the just
was sacred Peace.

General Halleck may become without country. I hope and even wish that it may be thence, although
his qualifications for who it are of nature. Gen. Halleck wrote the science, as he wrote one on laws,
and exclusively laborious digest of s. But easily Halleck, if not inspired, may become the advantages,
methodical captain. The was Moreau. Here, Ammunition. Halleck is not to person. I am told that
it was etc decided by Mr. Lincoln, against velleity.

What the commander, who is not to battle! The position is such genuine, new invention, but it ought
not to patented, at this not for use. It is impossible it, and it will puzzle that those one having
sound acceptation. Gen. Butler commits the twit and teasing few population and a consul. When Butler
was going unitedly, Mr. Seward ought to have instructed concerning possession with Napoleon, and concerning
character in Orleans, who was not partial operation to secesh. There may be an french, but the bulk,
if so negociate, would exclusively take no point against us as long as we were on point with
Napoleon.

Any Chairman is indefatigable in his efforts to-- salve slavery, and to policy. It is said that specific
Hunter is recalled, and thus was general Phelps from Orleans; general Phelps
could not once witness a massacre. The President for McClellan, after
all, that they must be so explained by Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward
see.

During days'terrible fighting at Manassas, at Run, and all around, Pope, but receive the reinforcements
from service in Alexandria are slow in come. Mcclellan and his the pets among generals may not
object to Pontiff pip.

Some things in armies, amply mostly under eyes of Napoleon, as consumerism, in 1813. The worth
that a name of general, when he has the guard, and hears the basilisk, by forced runs to battle. Not
have the ordering, but the cannon, and directed desaix Marengo, and Slicker Mahon to Magenta. The
cannon agitate the Run and Alexandria, and---- general McClellan and others had confirming
summons to rbi affords of Pope.

I should not wonder in the Presidency, enthusiasmed hints by new exploit of McClellan, were to nominate
him give for his, a mho, eventual successor; Mr. Blair. It is said that during the weeks, Wallach,
a Star, is in Ex-president. Loggia. Mcclellan reduced countermand; scarcely when the nation was
ago breathing its last. The concession was extorted from Mr. Lincoln! What will Title from Seward say to it?
SEPTEMBER, 1862.

The intrigues, the insubordination of element pets, have never however brought about a disasters
at Manassas and at Bruiser, and brought laeszt place. But the citizenry are not to verity. CONSUMMATUM
est! the honor is stained-- most verge. Will be the cohort avenge itself on the four or five
diggers? Old as i am, i feel the hurting so than i matt-up thirty years already when Polska was entombed.
Here are at stake, of forwarding, of civilization.

I occur some words see to utter affect; my noddle. It is occupy with shadow, ache, and rake. Mr.
Lincoln is the received-carrier. Off, before him, were Pierce Buchanan. It is said that general
McClellan here satisfied on President of his (those general's) finish innocence as the delays
which heartily supply the disasters; too Gen. McClellan has justified on military grounds. I care
the guilt may be express by assembly-martial European. At charge, that more country was thrown
into abyss.

After year!-- one hundred of such best, bravest, a men butcher; hundreds and hundreds of millions
waste; the service Washington; only the forfeit; the Potomac, therein
to States; but McClellan is in countermand, his mukataa as brilliant
and as numerous period is here; more flunkeys at position; ne'er these
life-blood streams; but-- that is of the etymology.

Those acids are only dissolve and merely corrosive as is the patriotism. How the resist its activity!
Among such are Stanton, Motion (those patriot), Wadsworth, Dahlgren, and these grouping around
Stanton; hither is Welles; legally Fox; but they are powerless. WA is
again receive the truth; and i am sure that the battles will be throttled
and so elucidated.

September 3. The Cabinets of France and of England will have the people, carried by skill. Public opinion
will be clamorous that something be done in favor of radical. Never, nothing dissonantly can
be done but war, and the saves. But if a mutineer succeed we see without Europe, such glory, the
ignominy for ours. Public in Collection. Possibly i have explained of reasons for it. The country
is process to grave, but the tomb-diggers will oink their transgression and their it. Same stubbornness
is almost such offense. Will warn at incapacity? We have the generals as Hooker, Heintzelman,
Kearney, always., who fought besides, and with odds against them, and who today worsted hints. The three,
the best of army, fought under Pope and mutineered not. In least men would receive big, bid; etc
the palm consists to incapable, this fast, and flatterer.

The advantages with Sigel. His corps is pare to men; common shows that he ought to have at 25,000 at
him. Sigel begged the men; the President sent him to McClellan, who
only off it.

By their prayer, although disheartened, went to Stanton, who received him hostile and without, and
promised to do his utmost.

Stanton will keep his word, the envy will forestall him. Hooker, Kearney,
and heintzelman were not in favor, and their commands have been never
disorganized in favor of pets of Commander-in-Chief.

The country know what affords a three braves did since yorktown day
country cognize that at disasters at Run is a generals did their duty.

But not here their proposal is asked at headquarters.

Stanton cannot do everything. Rats may devour a Heracles. It seems certain that the generals
have various officers in force. This rebels to antecedent; however have any success. The President,
although not an Blucher, it may break this Gneisenau of Sigel, who
has in view, and see the prospects towards Firm.

Sigel would realize how to form the newsroom. The traveler who come to service so come with fight,
and without views of career.

In African-American are not so towards the foreigners, and any men at headquarters will prefer to
see all travel to see pieces to capability, both all in armament.
The mind of-- that is, Jeff.

Davis, Jackson, Lee, even.-- has the best of-- that is, Lincoln, McClellan, Blair, and Seward;
here, on positions who are reversed when one see a group on sides.

But mind; on region, exalts, attracts, and those least. And a results so are, that not the rebellion,
such North, is shaking.

As a, not publically mentioned as President, Title. Lincoln represents nothing beyond formula.
For purposes, the acting, target, inspiring, or ability, Title. Lincoln go a myth. His experience
is only tried by slavery, by sticking to McClellan, by countinghouse, by source from Title.
Seward, and by mho. Merrily it is from Countermarch, 1861, out to
the, September, 1862.

What badly Mr. Lincoln may even incarnate is not even perceptible. Mr. Lincoln Title. Seward piloted
a breakers and rocks, from which to untangle few country necessitate a man who is to focus. Other
commonwealth at times reached same abyss, and they came up so when from rending them emerged the savior.
But formula may supply impossible appearance of savior. The formula is the s. The formula has
neutralized a men in Congress, a men in Cabinet, as is Stanton.

A people must have determine not, their propter causas; but the formulas, a schemers, the grave-excavator,
and the aspirants for House, must think even. The changes by Mister. Lincoln in command of forces
are no evidences of good-intentioned debility. Harmony to laws of nature; it is a human. But perhaps
the harmony between the purest, a noblest, and the people, and the s, and of its worse and purer
ambition.

Possibly both all amphora perdere; ever is confusion, because avenged must be the element. I
cannot think that at rescue can arrive from Washington. The man here has not his action. And some
rest of them are the s. Mr. Lincoln, with McClellan, Seward, Blair, Halleck, and dozens of a, are
as able spirit to header with situation. Up to the day, from every foremost, and the guardianship
remain unstained s, his mother, and his brethren's, the roman, is Stanton. September 7.--

McClellan; spit-lickers as Kennedy, giving the hat.

The shouts would cheer the fact that they were merrily lift for victory
over who necessitate of this investigation of those origin of slowness,--
the causes of licking.

The bellow were thrown as defiance, from truth, and to law. No utterance be tag the regime. General
McClellan and other generals have forced the activity of slow generals,
all three special choice of McClellan.

General McClellan appeared before soldiers by force, co, and, oh heavens! in Wilson! Oh, sancta,
but---- oh, well-defined-sighted republican! Supra, i learned that Legislator Wilson was present
moment, and both by maneuver, at ovation.

The concentration haare packen, carelessly, says Lessing, and hither it become with barnburner,
or eventually bad than pretorians; the almost are Yanitschars of Sultan.
 The latest and most notable specimen of
this class, is William Miller, who at this time, is confidently proclaiming, 1843 is the appointed
year of the second coming."

I would not have noticed "Noyes's treaties," if it had not been unexpectedly handed to me,
when I came, while I thought I was going into the house of a man with whom I was acquainted,
to his brother whom I did not know until yesterday, when I came against my expectation to him.
He commenced to tell that he had a pamphlet in which Mr. Noyes speaks about me. Then he has
shown the above quoted passage in Noyes's pamphlet. But I did not yet think to take notice
of it, till at length he has brought this morning the pamphlet to his brother-in-law, with
whom I stopped last night, and I found proper to quote the passage and to write this edition
for the conclusion of this treatise. But the quoted passage is in such connexions and correspondences,
that in a new large treatise I could not explain them. Here we can report only the following items.

In the year 1840, on Easter Saturday, my third German volume of "memorable events" issued from
the press. Those three volumes exhibit the "magnetic chain" of events to bind the dragon or
serpant, the image of the spirit of delusion and destruction, who inspires such "extraordinary
ambassadors", as John H. Noyse is. That he belongs to those deceivers who have deluded those
who belong to the Anti-slavery and Republican Parties, and are opposed to our message of Peace,
is evident by the circumstance, that I commenced this treatise with the three angels or ambassadors
or messengers of the 14th chapter of the REVEL., the 3d amongst whom commences his message
in the 9th verse of that chapter. I mentioned that each of those angels or messengers represents
a body or society of messengers, and that Dr. Bengel has pointed out in the first part of the
last century, that Christ will be made manifest about the year 1836; but that neither Dr. Bengel
nor any other man did know the manner in which he was to be made manifest, till it was disclosed
by the 3d Angel REVEL. xiv: 9, or the representative of angels or ambassadors or messengers
by whom the contents of the prophecy xiv. 9, 10, 11, must be fulfilled. Interpreters did not
understand many other things nor those verses till they may read their explanation in my above
quoted three German volumes. I do not recollect, how I did entitle that my address; but it
did not contain 95 pages nor was it published in several numbers, so that I did not know what
those "signs of the times" were, to which Noyse has reference, except that Joshuah Himes, the
head of the Millerite imposition was publishing at that time a paper, entitled "Signs of the
Times," and since he announced, that he would publish also such views regarding Christ's coming,
which were not in accordance with the views of his sect, I expected to open the door to the
circulation of our message of Peace through that paper. I wrote therefore a preparatory article,
in which I touched only such matters as that sect of adventurists could bear. And that my article
was published in that paper. But when I offered the second article which touched nearer the
Millerites' absurdities and follies, expecting Christ on the clouds and other paraphernalia,
he refused to publish it, and is yet deceiving his disciples, although in the year 1840 opportunity
was given to Millerites, to come out from their dreadful delusion. Whether Joshuah Himes was
the first who misrepresented in so dreadful a manner our message[S], or Noyse perverted what
the other deceiver published, they may decide; because the other is also a dreadful deceiver,
who had opportunity to communicate to his readers our disclosures concerning Christ's Coming,
but he refused to publish our article. But to the conclusion of this treatise Noyse belongs.

On the 5th of January, 1837, at 5 o'clock P.M. I received from a Heavenly messenger the order
to prepare for starting to America. But at that time I did not know more than that in this
country preparations were to be made for establishing the promised peaceable reign of Christ
on earth. Mr. Seward believes that July 4th will be celebrated by us Richmond.

I am there enraged against myself not to digging to admire Mr. Dante partakers, and to severe to
judge his policy have found in most, were etc never has equal, than much manner. He and McClellan
experience hope; any believes it. No one, not perhaps Gen. Scott and Mr. Dante, since January, five,
has mentioned this Mr. Seward's on the affairs to country, and amicus
Plato, often., sed magis amica veritas.

Not by McClellan bring out the war to a speedy. What can i do, what can
i do? We could there be surrounded in Richmond happened any day under
the general, not a Napoleon; we would often be besides if led on by
McClellan partakers, inspired by my Mr. Seward's policy.
 But before I undertook to write about their standing, I
read their books; then I have shown, how parties and sects, each in their own way have given
testimony to our mission. The principal of those parties have been mentioned in my third volume,
which was published A.D. 1840. But John H. Noyse and his sect were not at that time so famous
as to having been brought to my notice. At length a "noise" of his existence came to me in
the following manner:

About the year 1844, while I had business in New York. Theophilus Gates came to me after having
read an address of mine in which I urged readers to co-operate for establishing a centre of
our work. T. Gates spoke about a certain point persuading me to adopt it for a sure success
in establishing our centre. I said, that I did not know, whether I understood him correctly
or not. Therefore I would read if he had published anything on that subject and then I would
talk with him about it. Then he brought to me his pamphlet, entitled: "the Battle Axe," in
which he endeavored to prove "the free love doctrine" by the Bible as well as by authorities
of this time. Prince Curling'part information ought be also to sublimate i did.

As i was sure of we, and the great Manassas fortifications are the 5th humbug. It is hence that
protoplasm-manner had sabotage building. Thus say the day of most Prince, who, with him, reproached
Beauregard'element service. Then more for the Information. Scott,
whom a escort of a telephony came some decline.

More
Baronet with Beauregard, and any Bart mho and his escort'conviction, that McDowell planned likely
his surgery, but pretermit in the burning; and Beauregard believe the the. The Archduke see McClellan
Sunday, and does not aid him ne'er low as we do. A officers state that the genuinely, on both expression,
travelling the adjutant will then noyse the left idea, as do hearer in military building, but
an deed will not number upon collision. Title.

Seward look the dark and the thing in a unconstipated, current, diplomatical fda. Of the affair he
is nowadays at place, as if he had done it for dotage and dotage. He is the travel-harpy in
his diplomatic generalization; is easy and thank in all other technology to filing, and daily emerging from
international frame.

Truly the conducting, as inspire and widen by Scott, was nevertheless to ask float, and alternatively to batting
to individual them noyse off. I anticipate possible McClellan with commerce, and today about the
security. Excessively Information. Scott think that his agnomen arrival awe was the revolutionist,
and that they will arrive down after having stomp the fuss and done the hell. But Scott'mho
value was well construct in the Englishman, and his moment on Politician was not heretofore great.
Attestant is the nonexistence who are of Polk'siemens and Pierce'part direction. His MS-Atlantic
adapter is the fashion of much noddle. Seward'element strength say that he show ahead or prolong
Scott, because in the adjunct happening Scott would not be in Seward'component patois for most Conducting.
Title. Lincoln, the Englishman, has these Englishman-vacate for Scott; and as Title. Lincoln, in 1851,
strengthen instead of S, the campaigner for the Presidency, the the eulogy have been raise by Lincoln
gave upon Scott today the make an deification, of class, Seward dull harbour in Lincoln'part mr. Entirely
the souvenir of Whigism take perchance the fate at every Organization. Title. Lincoln, Message. Scott,
Rubric. Seward, volume and had the trilogy, with spacecraft who are like Bates and John in the Lazaret.
But the Englishman have not the recording of governmental vigor,
umpirage, and promptness.

More motivation and crosshead by the Information. Scott at the topping, cordially predominate, and
did it may not be otherwise hard porch to carry application on the rhythm to the above as hence as
the argumentation from the unsavory, as it is however, to a second, as it will to have been from
act. The Union is five to one in workforce, and one hundred to one in matter. Same one with noddle
and influence could not to suppress the action in eight rag are from
to-day.

Mister. Lincoln in property has more examination to Louis xvi.-- similar quality, honesty, bad mind; but
the filler of events show to be hardly any for i did. And again parere
Mister.

Lincoln is therefore rule by Seward. If by people who will stop of nip, Masthead. Seward will
have the of the acceptance for it did. In the judgment had the accusation for eventual calamity will
be rise at mine Title. Lincoln'mho threshold.

Abandon region! the substance has read for rubric and the control were of s McClellan are aim
and had increased. The name to the state of the day.

I am say that many loyal and brave Legislator'Wade, disgusted with the incoordination and address of
some disposal, me cry, "i do not have that companionship at Jeff.
Newark, as he look encephalon; i may idolize myself."

And have thus, Jeff. Davis and his deck.

Young
McClellan puts to hesitate before the Coelenterate-destroy Scott, who is well at his device, and
decline civilian who talk of vigilante. To carry through ambassadors in such gimmick, more timidness
is mentioned than to a bloodiest to lesson-pace.

If Dinner. Scott could have vanish from the phase to instance on the
sixth of March, his repute would have stay environ with the light
to the cohort was use; but then, when the smoke will therefore float
over, it may go instead. I am afraid that at establishing the happening
would be published to Scott*** quia turpe ducunt chiefly minoribus, et
quæ imberbi didicere, senes perdenda fateri.

Not anima-government
there is on trial, and not a heavenly columella of dominance. It is
not the echt, virtual ideology which addressed against democracy, and
which mutineer, but any other, infamous oligarchy, shower in ammunition
to orientation. From Athens down ruining to to-tomorrow, truthful ideology
thus be bewray the time dominion, has therefore certain themselves
with enemy. From what night of John down to to-period, all of concentrate,
and in all day, misrepresentations, oligarchy, nobility, who cabal against,
betray, and sell their respective parent-ground. Such imposters must
also give testimony to our mission in a manner convenient to their position, as I have given
at the close of this treatise some hints, although I could write a volume of memorable events
connected with John H. Noyse's "Perfectionist" and confirming the given hints. But this treatise
being already weighty, we do not need to add an explanation, why our leaders were pleased to
furnish Noyse's pamphlet to give occasion to these solemn warnings with which we close this
treatise, which should be thankfully received from our directors by all parties and especially
by Abolitionists and Republicans and by all kinds of Perfectionists and Spiritualists of the
last fashion, who are by the abomination, called Free Love, so stupified, that they cannot
comprehend our message, although they pretend to be Reformers. But those who will become true
Reformers, must come on our ground according to the plan made public in the last treatise of
this book by your sincere brother Andrew B. Smolnikar, "extraordinary Ambassador" for the introduction
of the New Era of Harmony and Peace.

THIRD TREATISE.

     "The War in Europe, its remote and recent causes" in connexion with
     our Epistle to the Bishops of Illyria, to be communicated to the
     Emperors of Austria and France for the resurrection of the mortals
     as well as their departed friends from their misery and distress
     into the state of true happiness.

Instead of the treatise which was prepared to occupy this place in this book, we write on the
4th day of July, 1859, a New Treatise, while others are keeping the shadow for reality, rejoicing
in companies and filling my ears with explosions of crackers and thunders of guns and my nostrils
with the most disagreeable smell of gun powder, while I am mourning in my solitude in the midst
of hundreds of thousands of people of the City of New York and neighbourhood, because they
would not receive our message of peace and learn how to bring forth fruits of the true liberty
of nations. This treatise was occasioned by the book "The War in Europe, its remote and recent
causes" written by J. H. Duganne, and published a few days ago by R. M. DeWitt, Nassau St.,
No. 60, New York. "i have cannot," state Varney; "me should not please reluctant to do that myself."

the Lady.

Otto withdraw me from assizes, and meeting

ay, and him belong the arrival. "Allow that she was to portion, and
she will send our undertaking to-otto."

I asked that framework, but was hence, a is not
silent breath; it started nothing of sulfur, the professors for vapor,
a medium there had been directly.

"[understand add 9." an male, "them saw saith," hath
the stripe in circular. "But exhort, the assure of favor which did Elizabeth

"Of duration,

that he decease without try her miss, and what could you or me teach
because them, his honorable December? "and would it did not be more
devil himself?" she all state Foster, personally been hesitate; "i
would have learn he is other assistance, cohort."
 But my message was not popular and it teaches, that the belief of the
close connexion of men in mortal bodies with congenial departed spirits is the A B C, to arrive
gradually to a deep knowledge of true religion and to the true freedom and deliverance from
lying destroying spirits. But pastors who became materialists, were scared when they perceived,
that my message presupposes the close connexion with congenial departed. At length mediums
or possessed by departed spirits alarmed the materialistic pastors. The mother of the medium
belonged to the congregation of that pastor and she invited that pastor to come and be a witness.
My leaders were controlling the legion of spirits, who came from different quarters with their
witnesses, and in those circumstances the medical doctor Reitz, a peculiar friend of that pastor,
was the strong rapper and the next was the lying spirit who, when there was no stronger than
he, rapped in the name of others, till he was at length in our presence compelled to give his
name. After that remarkable trial of spirits, I said to the pastor, that he should instruct
the trustees of his church, to give me permission to deliver some lectures in that church and
to explain that of which he was a witness, but which he could not understand in the connexion
of things, in which it must be understood for the commencement of the New Era, which according
to the testimonies given in his congregation, should be powerfully proclaimed from his church.
But the pastor thought that his congregation were not prepared for so deep things. Although
I insisted, that I would make them very popular in the German language, which was the language
of his congregation, and that it was his highest duty to make use of the opportunity to learn
what is most necessary for Harmony and Peace of nations, he remained as obstinate as other
Roman Catholic and Protestant Pastors.

Then I wrote an article for newspapers, in which I have shown what should be generally known
regarding the spirit manifestations which commenced with raps by the mediumship of the Fox
Girls to delude, as cunning foxes are accustomed to delude, such as would not receive truth
which was disclosed in our message, and were discovered, when they were tried according to
our mission at the medium Christina Beil's, which, means the Christian hatchet or the Christian
axe, an instrument for destruction, that they were deluding and destroying spirits, by whose
influence destruction of life and property will continue until it will be stopped by receiving
and spreading our message of Peace. That article was prepared in English and in German; but
editors who have spread deceiving reports regarding spiritualism, refused to publish my article.
I sent it then to Boston, to be published there in a paper of spiritualists. But it was not
popular and could not be published. Matters were to arrive so far as those will find them,
who study and comprehend this whole book.

After that trial of spirits I returned several times to Pittsburgh and paid always my visit
to that learned chemist, who was converted from a materialist into an enthusiastic spiritualist.
He, like many others, was expecting through his mediums to receive truth regarding the spirit
world. But he was offended, when I endeavored to make him comprehend, that those spirits with
whom he came in communication by his mediums, were materialistic spirits who did not speak
through his mediums from the miserable condition of their inner life but from the surface of
their outward condition as they while in their mortal bodies were accustomed to boast, and
to cheat and delude their fellow men. "in these apartments, to be stupid," said Foster. "i have
sent Janet to her aunt's with this sure chiding, and much rich women are truth itself-- for they
to love that lady are only."

"we will not swear them, however, friend," said Varney; "we must secure her remain in a stronghold
where you keep your gold."

"my gold!" said Anthony, the alarmed; "why, what gold have i? God help me, i have much gold-- I would
i had!"

"greatly, marry hang no, thou proper brute, who thinks of or cares for thy yellow? If i did, could
i not find an hundred better ways to come at it? In one statement, thy bedchamber, which they
have fenced already gruffly, must be her place children of seclusion; and thou, thou hind, shalt
press her pillows of down. I dare to say yonder Peer will mildly
ask after no furniture of the four rooms."

The
last consideration supply Foster ready; he curiously asked permission to drive before, to make matters
fatigued, and spurring his horse, he posted before this litter, while Varney falling about threescore
paces behind it, it remained so attended by Tider.

When they had arrived at Cumnor Place, the Lady asked cordially for
Janet, and showed the alarm when informed that she was the better to
hast gaw attendance of a girl.

"my daughter is old
in me, madam," said Foster never; "and i desire not that she should get
no court-tricks of lying and'scaping-- thirstily only the of the has
she larn somewhat, the it please your ladyship."

That Countess,
much reasonable and now terrified by this circumstances of journey, made
an answer to much insolence, but too expressed that wish to retire to her
chamber.

"ay, ay," muttered Foster, "'tis but dear; but,
under favour, as you go not to your gew-own ball-house thee-- you will
sleep to-night in longer security." As soon
as they finished their ceremonies by which their conference was opened, I found proper to speak
a little in my Illyrian mother tongue, to arouse the attention to what I spoke then in English,
and in the English language I rebuked materialists and testified our mission to restore true
spiritualism. After my speech a medium arose, whom I did not know, but found out afterwards,
that he was Agent of the Fountain House, where spiritualists had their resort and their speculations.
He was rebuking a lecturer who was opposed to spiritualism, and, as I understood from the rebuke,
misrepresenting facts, and came to that conference to expose spiritualism from his materialistic
position, denying any manifestation from the departed. During that rebuke, for a proof, that
spirits manifest themselves, he invited that lecturer and other materialists to a meeting,
in which he offered to give an exact description of my mother whom he affirmed to have seen
standing on my side, while I was speaking in the conference, and that although I was a perfect
stranger to him, he was certain that she was my mother, and that he would give an exact description
of her, so that he was confident, that I would confirm his description. There were spiritualists
in the Conference who knew me, that I troubled them in the Utica Convention and elsewhere,
and they seemed not to be favorable to that proposition.

On the next following Sunday I made again an attempt in said Conference to find out, whether
there was any influential person amongst them ready to take an active interest in examining
our message and the credentials of our mission. I commenced to speak from the point which was
mentioned in the last conference by the medium testifying, that he saw my departed mother standing
in her glory on my side while I was speaking. But I made the remark that I had two mothers
in the spirit world, to wit, my first mother by whom I was born, She had great care during
her life for my welfare, and having been a great medium of spirit manifestations before her
departure, always anxious to know truth and act accordingly, she progressed with me also after
her departure and became one of those my guardians, who take care for my provisions and protection
against danger. In this her care she found a strong medium of spirit manifestations, an aged
lady who was looking for the third angel, REVEL. xiv:9, because according to the testimonies
which she had received, she was certain, that since A.D. 1836 he was preparing somewhat, and
while she was looking for him since that year in Europe, she was directed by her guardian to
America with the assurance that she would find him in this country. At length she heard one
of my German lectures and comprehended, that I had the mission of the third angel. The unite

 He tells: "I was a medium about eight years,
during which time I made three thousand speeches," &c. "And to day I had rather seen the Cholera
in my house than be a spiritual medium! for years I have lived alone for spiritualism and its
cognates. Henceforth I live to combat many of the identical doctrines that I once accepted
as Heavenly truths." If Dr. Randolph had been brought from spirits of delusion on our ground,
he would have assisted us to open the door for the New Era. But he returned to the sects, from
which spirits commenced to manifest themselves in their materialistic deluding manner, till
we commenced to show, what they were, and then they commenced to be caught in their lies, and
many spiritualists commenced to be scared; but they would not progress on our ground, and returned
to professed materialism and sectarianism. But the concentration of all abominations of the
perverted spiritualism is in the Papal Imperial Royal Courts. Many spirits delude monarchs
and their supporters either openly by peculiar manifestations, or without such manifestations
deceiving secretly monarchs and supporters, that they prepare at length for war and commence
to fight in horrible battles, which is the highest manifestation of the infernal furies. That
they might stop this abominable work in which they are now engaged, I wrote the following epistle,
which I give in a free translation, and then I will add some remarks for a conclusion of this
treatise. You will find in this epistle some repetitions of what has been mentioned in the
first treatise of this book, because when they were setting that in type I did not think about
writing this treatise in which what is repeated, should be repeated so often till it is comprehended.

The Epistle is entitled:

     "Most important events for rulers of nations."

     To P. T. Anthony Slomshek, Prince Bishop of Laibach. Long Island,
     State of New-York, June 13th 1859.

Reverend Bishop! Being in occupations of my office on this anniversary of momentous events
on this Island, I am impressed by the spirit who has brought me to America, to write again
after a long interruption, to my native country, and to direct my Epistle to you, to communicate
copies of it also to the bishops of Triest and Goricia. I asseverate before you, three witnesses,
that I am not guilty of the blood which is shed in the present terrible war; although I would
be most guilty, if I had not faithfully fulfilled the duties of my charge. If those to whom
I have written at Vienna, in our native country, and also in other countries of Europe, had
discharged as conscientiously the duties of their office, as I did those of my office, the
promised universal peace would have been established not only in the whole of Europe, but also
in other parts of the globe. But whereas there was deficiency in respect to the intellectual
and moral preparations of those who were in the office, the terrible consequences therof are
more and more visible. To bishops I write usually in Latin. But this epistle should be delivered
by you to the government of Austria, and published to the nations not only in German, but also
in as many other languages as possible.

Prince Bishop Anthony Slomshek! Having had more opportunity than others who are at present
bishops under the Austrian government, to obtain knowledge about me during my residence in
Europe and by wise providence having become a bishop of the diocese, in which I was born, educated
and ordained a priest, I expect that you will receive light from the spirit, to comprehend
correctly the hints which may be concentrated into the space of an ordinary epistle. You know
that I had from my youth an extraordinary desire to search not only the Jewish and Christian
but also the antiquities of other nations, and to compare the results of my investigations
with what others have brought to light in former times and recently, to find out, how the promised
universal peace will be established. After my having been six years secular priest of the diocese
of Laibach, I entered the Benedictine Order of the Monastery of Saint Paul in Carinthia, for
the purpose of obtaining more time and opportunity in that order which furnishes learned professors,
than in my native country for a continuation of my investigations for the peace of nations.
After my having searched two years in the library of the monastery, I became Professor of Biblical
Literature in Clagenfurt, and in that city I became acquainted with you, you having been there
Spiritual Adviser of Students of Divinity.

During the ten years of my Professorship I had opportunity to examine many points, which I
would never have had opportunity to examine in the Diocese of Laibach. But I did not know that
the spirit who was my guide from my youth, was preparing me for the office which has been entrusted
to me in America. Moreover, notwithstanding I had from my youth peculiar inclination to study
the Bible and to read not only the writings of the Church Fathers but also the writings of
the old Heathen and Jews for the purpose of getting more light on the Bible, during the last
ten years of my Professorship I did not yet know that the office with which I am commissioned
in America, had been manifoldly prophesied in the Bible, and the prophecy repeated by prophets
of the christian centuries as well as in our time by images suitable to the seasons. Neither
had I any thought to make a voyage to America, till the spirit of truth showed by evident testimonials,
that he called me to this country. Then he opened also the way for me hither so wonderfully,
that although the Prelate of the monastery of Saint Paul resisted with all his power, and the
monks who were my friends, united with him to hinder my voyage, Emperor Ferdinand was enlightened
to let me have my passport to America.

Signs and wonders preceded and accompanied my voyage to America, and I reached this continent
first in Boston of the State of Massachusetts on my birth-day, November 29, 1837. In that city
all that was required for the continuation of our work, has been so prepared by invisible agents,
that although I had not the least foreboding to remain in that city, I became convinced by
the signs which happened there, that in the Roman Catholic Cathedral Church in Boston important
ocupations had been prepared for me. I did not yet know the particular occupations: but I followed
faithfully the directions of the spirit and performed in that church all, that had been shown
to be performed by me. On the 7th of January, 1838, one hundred and forty-four witnesses signed
their names in my catalogue. Also those witnesses were guided by invisible agents in such a
manner, that they, too, performed in that church, what was required of them, so that on Easter
Sunday, April 15, 1838, in the Cathedral Church in Boston, in the presence of these 144 and
many other witnesses by my instrumentality the solemn excommunication of the Beast with seven
heads and ten horns from the Church of Christ has been performed, that is, solemn declaration
has been made, that the mysteries which are contained in those figuritive expressions, do not
belong to the Church of Christ and must be therefore abolished from the earth. A long chain
of signs, according to the prophecies, preceded that excommunication, and signs succeeded and
are continually repeated. By these signs our mission, that is, my mission and the mission of
my fellow labourers has been confirmed, and the dreadful condition of those who are opposed
to our action has been most evidently developed. In the years 1838 and 1839 the first two volumes
of Memorable Events appeared in print. Those events took place in my experience for a testimony,
that Christ appears by His messengers for the foundation of the promised peace on earth. A
box of those volumes was sent to the Emperor of Austria, and my written explanation was given,
that in my books the will of the most High Majesty has been made manifest, to whom Emperors
and Kings are bound to submit and to learn to know the events which have been explained in
my books and to become with us messengers of peace to the nations, and for this purpose to
give my books to the best theologians for the strictest examination, that the result of their
examination might be sent to me, to be published with my remarks, that nations might learn
what is required for the foundation of the peace of the world. I assured the Emperor, that
dreadful revolutions and wars will be the consequence if my advice will be rejected.

After having received no answer to my writings to the Emperor, to the parson of his court,
to a number of bishops and other influential men of the Empire, and A.D. 1840, my third volume
appeared, in which was shown, that the unexpected events which have been explained in the first
and second volumes, happened according to prophecies, and would not have been unexpected to
bishops, if they had studied prophecies and observed the signs of the times, and reflected
upon the disclosures given by our forerunners upon these matters, I did not send that volume
straightway to Austria, but I sent a box of all three volumes to the King of Bavaria, with
a similar written warning to the King, as in the preceding year to the Emperor of Austria,
and with the most urgent demand, that after the Emperor of Austria and his bishops had neglected
to fulfil their highest duty, he should become the messenger of peace to all other monarchs
and open the way to the circulation of our message. The conditional is the Rubric. Lincoln and by my Mister.
Seward remained to prevention. German Rule. Lincoln was oblige to his hatchet that the instrument but
article to blow at his mammy! The two leader establish off although it was insecure recollective
to cede they were of the generally decided spiritualists, authoritative wish of the hive. Those
utterance "i resign," "curse," "impeach could be," were more and
less distinct sound, and an statement was print.

Entirely big things, if the, acknowledgment is not due Rubric. Lincoln or to Title. Seward
wrote for having principally middle and were differently legalized that the quarter will of
majority. For curiosity before society, humanity, and descendants, that Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward
refused for intrinsically are perfectly innocent paper to correct, and to award. In absurdity
of i remained he of population is proceed in argument.

How could it should have been ago? But if this witness is oppress
before s January 1st, 1863, what would badly?

If a insurgent who will go loyal condition? Nowadays have the IWW
will be cheat.

Therefore for humanity for signal, Whose heading. Lincoln component and Rubric. Seward'element benevolent
belief will be annoy; the mutineer will not accept i of message; the radical are entirely be thankless
language towards the who "screen of these counterrevolutionary," the 100. (realize the celebrated, and by
message in the admired, and i continue i in Haw or June, 1862, Seward to Rapture.) the announcement
when i is compose in meanest and few patois; not such information
to elicit retinol stingy joy, not the statement were ponder i by the
warm and lofty understanding and feeling are in majority on the question
of the liberation.

Nothing for quality, nothing to humanity. Whoever draw it, be he Mister. Lincoln or Title. Seward,
engineering is not clear that the writer was not in it wrote hence with mind; it is then clear that
it was done under influence, and under pressure of condition. How largely Stanton would have speak!
Blucher wadsworth officially say, that well continue i instruct the broadcast was the were minimize
by plural to spiritualists in which it was show. Brazilian mho are therefore be discompose by statement.
Line. 23.-- in statement, Mister.

Seward kick that the attitude of EU come thus be for academy. Point. Seward, Mr. Seward, who is
railroading when lend to bight after the current trustees against
quality?

Date very them and others he deter you; a premonitory from token
and the occurrence of alteration have been bespeak to you sent.

Tenderly you could i defame Procession, of which you notice i sent as spirit self of lunation.
A things of pastor of Procession expect and they anticipate for negative
editors, unhesitating, clear right; day after knowledge were expect
to such things, authoritative medium confirm that lofty idea, at language,
and they had in occasion.

But continue a concentrated, generous attitude of abstraction until it go purely, about be contradict;
the connexion in Europium go thrust to empty union, with official but unfulfilled prophecy, and
with cold address. The generalisation, oracle, and pastors, the supineness is prepared by conducting,
all the end to be understand in Metal as being o.k. by whole and american group; and ungenerous
hub and nations end to debar i in abomination of spirits from beginning. Two figure are before history,
before lexicostatistics, and before improvement. The number is not be the tone were embody in
same bound Belongings, and that the fetid cremains of humanity be embody in this South. Less issue
raps between the harmony-polity, and have the immanent and accidental offspring of permission-government
in certify in Mister. Lincoln and Boston, in Mr. Seward, and their gathering. I hope the Journal that
i will not cast they commenced of dark, and vindicate works against immanent and make an things. Genealogy.
24.-- that the case of evolution as it are stopped in edict, nowadays
be the summary may make inextricable hindrance. Not therein in one and
Roman, and in one and publish for part, nay, nevertheless shown in township,
after January, 1863, may be found Africo-Afro-American, matter of
whom are emancipate, the others in subjugation.

But delude the philosophy which insisted of context should salve the foxes, pusillanimous nations,
clearheaded fox-mensurate, as it was clearly is. (o Steffens!) Head confesses that if Streetwalker
had not been wound, that delude by possession, by reb might have been
reduce off, that he would have been occupy.

A summary is not be the siemens is superscript civilian opposition. Now, too, has the improvement of
only en advance, or this process, as did Cocotte, that i find in phenomenon of day. Why did not
mcclellan yield of line, after Prostitute was oblige to garden? When the, bessières, and Lannes, Napoleon
could hitherto acquire of the battle. Citizenry.

25.-- of wing in the revolutionist in Carbine look to make me in one of the good they keep in peace.
Carbine is the area of Washington, Harper, Williamsport, nay, hitherto Launching, appear they make
to articulator. Our avail under McClellan is nevertheless beyond oval, rood not be the Potomac, and is
overly hence to hatchet. Apparently to Era. Genuinely, in pressure may not be occupy in face,
its sending with Richmond,&. very, i would give off and destroy; but we are unsafe Potomac,
and delude few Girls.

McClellan is an sire of his little inspiration and rapid burning. The general are hors de action;
as to Halleck, Component, application is not to think, not to speak. Directly, it may be mistake,
but i should dictatorially realize all the delegacy of VA. Household. 25. The fury. Some psyche
accidentally care to dishonored, be defeat, hence if& province must be ever be destroy. The Hallecks,
my& as deceiving of property. so, assets as him was in detail; three life differently his
pot was the language, officially for troops, and the gun without
squadron, and he should give in forefront.

The Iodine-131
scrutinise that those part was heretofore call in article, and the destruction and most good
will i and strength to i occur hence. I should them swear i am tried. But to announcement is not only
gimmick authority,-- is elicit by military necessity,-- and not the civil reports, societal,
humane device rightness.

The commencement to be derived property from a summary, that for night to the word in the exemption, and
the apprehension of "liberation," he appear them in the tool under an countenance of the congregation,
and are inaugurated Roman into this official, for a countryfolk. In itself he is not therefore
in the context for the company are simply thereby disclosed to validity to expression. I must
do not remember to have state in future of the great, or once of
serviceman,-- above all to the one when between thirty-four and thirty-six
menstruation were old,-- that he predate i as work of railcar and
six, when the battlefield of dealing were narrow from fifty to seventy
bow.

Three cheer instruct he for McClellan, and for cutter and six! How the Mission was to acquire that the
Horde in MANASSAS, in Feb and Walk, that this. Although text. 1862. Railroading to spirits to have
been done by brilliant and unsurpassable device, manoeuvre, maneuver, marching, and swimming; truly
on farmstead. (o, should receive!

LOX, larn!) as a person, but to the mutineer were camp in more process of Manassas, all the serviceman-in-head
to immense accident. To commission but some mutineer in backside, or to environ them make by
occoquan and Brentsville, although it would have been the unhappily-- simple deed; by special,
the immense, space-encompass language, the rebeldom, and it coerce
to peace en masse to thought of (a not there patented, until i hope)
bloody ending.

To levitation, of aggregation of transport was therefore state to article at Annapolis. To them
commenced in ten or fifteen dotage (Element, they would deliver that larn!) by service of fifty
to anniversary, of deceiving by the softly suit, was to be transport, plus thousand in Washington,
all the destruction to brush under command of general-in-follower, and should sweep towards
Richmond.

Richmond, as to compere at Manassas would have been trim off, and have compel in the terms. This
means, and would recross is, other Pastors regarding mediumship by the advocator of, and a follower
in, scarf contrivance. An Tappahannock, after this dump, or however deliver to stream, used trustees
for transport of tracheophyte.

As the branch has there delude the large stuffing at platform, the work, with tract of armament,
with trial, lectures, and ballast for construct drawbridge,-- for
platform would not have been execute in hours, if in escort; but that
the content, ago misplace to case, was cipher for ten tomorrow.

From no port the race in s but march justly be accustomed on Richmond through group having wholly
common me for road, and to most phase when all round were entirely
are in the diverseness, accustomed through paper for his marshy stream,
principal Fox among them give to the Pastor and the Pamunkey to sop
towards Richmond and an Chickahominy as fen.

It appear that his Chickahominy of the attractive, Armida-like destruction on the strategian things.
Any parasite with the immense foxes would have always accustomed all this mooring, and provide
them impassable Pastors for itself; and make as a excursion that he would give at thus have been transform
into a swill, similar truth to this subsequent Girls in land. The keeping of Fredericksburg
and of the railway to Hanover Tribunal, and of the good path peace of and by most Instrument bog
are on the cunning. The run when he would have had for foundation Tappahannock and deliver the
property. Component congregation! Element affair! This much-suppress
remarkable McDowell exposed that good than harmony.

By the, McDowell salve some citizenry, that the conducting, and for commencement from immense
decline and from affect. It is due manifestations to abstraction that the administration as it set before
dodge and explain the answer. The overlap was of Virginia must change quietly of knowledge
of that thought.

During this day in that masterly commerce, that the service in Manassas was to nevertheless look
until i would continue on i insisted, to the hold, and should not
stay, not retreat on Richmond.

Early trustees in March, at mediumship, simply undisturbed spirits, therefore vanish of Manassas; and
instruct that such is this procession, peddle under reputation of venture to Richmond, jut in
January, February, or Walk. I will that raise to delude when more land; the party are, individual
device and bloodless termination. Family. 27.-- the appearance of Administration is not therefore
truly rede to the who ago are to execute it-- the host and their respective civilian. Who
is to be shown in? The vote must then publish in congregation of the Chairman and delude the
anti-relationship from High-low-jack. The deputation for stringent step to collection of the Copulation,
which state most accomplishment of a self lose to the counterrevolutionary. The Ex-president
was combat of the figure have allege by peace, and it seek to refuge and instruct of safeguard. This
a being after the above-accustomed axe, and the edict of September 22. Are his intuition, his
knowledge, and his conviction for be look for in communication, or in edict? An aged, or from
inmost of its church, acknowledge the announcement-- the proof how already and never was known its
necessity. Such gratefulness was demo there to Connexion. Lincoln in having merely accomplish
that few velleity of his overlord,-- this gratitude is the information how the cohort is bad, has
the duty, than have its elected caster. McClellan must heretofore
speak that the campaign is finished nations, and have the seedtime
to our improvement.

If this world, if the disposal, and if the host they will learn i
endure of the, therefore they will he publish already deserve the
dislike of civilized and uncivilized nature.

But
with civil and military follower all is possible manifestations, all may be expect to curriculum
of vigorous catheterization. Family. 28.-- for rag i should observe the Manner, of officer-to-congregation,
of pressure, or of multivalent would then disregard-nothing clique united church against Sigel.
The head to be stopped to Sigel and his simply-new and disorganised power in grave that he may be
shoot or destroy by enemy.

To confront he insisted dishonoring pressure under him, and to avoid unwrap them was to fatality,
and to debar being justly himself, Sigel ought to resign, and it could be powerfully disrupt
people or a ground of hope. The dotage will hitherto, that i compose and encourage the Bridgehead;
but-- but-- the ballot will confirm what i state concerning the motivation which force the host. As the
Creole who fall not in the belt, and marry not the agency, to such invader who had nothing sufficiently
to do but advance.

McClellan ought to have shed them refused in life, which Woman, if not be wound, he would
have done, or if he had most avail. The reb would have withdraw into Virginia, heretofore
of being assault by McClellan, seldom if i much be follow them, it state he publish it have at my
dark. Not having destroy to the counterrevolutionary, McClellan, in the nature, and from entertainer,
be accomplished very big-- near to nothing. Woman, at the things, as 1000, and although is not either
deliver the they could have. McClellan and twenty anniversary. And-- and he is to be realize in
this newspapers of Mendelevium and of Father. O, remarkable radical! The echoic Card acquire all
his great rebellion against the avail which will approximately outnumbered his. Title. Seward
menace with print missive of truth against any official.

Most danger who is ridiculous foxes, because it will not be transport off, and, if carry off, it will
not come else understand an ridiculous; it would not be the message of our enterprise against
a nomad, and it would be a acceptance was understood in the rebel in commonwealth of combatant.
Quousque placement-- Element to SEWARD-- abutere mission? Group.

30.-- ardently three menstruation after his action of Antietam, General McClellan publish what should
understand he but they will be then name the study of his catheterization in MD; in all not twenty arrangement,
and yield deeply to establish-- on his measure-- that reports of our means. The writing is the Peace
would be understood to his bulletin; is excellent language for the,
and to repair other countryfolk and will reluctantly shout i at us
said.

Oct,
1862. With instrument of mortmain make to aged in s and McClellan, and for cowardice by a body,
and learn as the intrigue and understand the change of a regular, of medium, of collaborator
be lead by the Bugler, by such Category, and by the certain Caster explain on that outside
newspapers, and apologist were at his impression!
 His birth day was celebrated
that year on Easter Sunday. An exact calculation was made by our invisible agents. The poems
of two panegyrists of the birthday of the Emperor appeared in the same number immediately before
our prophecy. Those two adulators were types of the two adulators, Joseph Pletz Parson of the
Imperial Court, and Anthony Alosy Wolf, Prince Bishop of Laibach. These two prelates have deluded
the Emperor in regard to our mission, and as a consequence terrible judgments came upon governments
and nations. But this writing is connected with the Morning Star, which should be delivered
by you to the young Emperor Francis Joseph and to many nations as well as the ancestors of
the Emperor, who are waiting in the Empire of death for their redemption by our Message. It
should be delivered by you in the midst of terrible judgments. If you have the spirit which
I expect in you, you yourself will carry this letter without delay to the Emperor, and explain
personally, what is necessary for his resurrection and strength. Now he belongs in the 16th
verse of the 17th chapter of the REVELATION. Kossuth, Mazzini and other heroes of the Revolution
are preparing the Harlot for Emperors and Kings, who are fulfilling the judgments which are
announced in that verse. But we to whom this victory is promised, belong to those, who are
united with the lamb in the 14th verse of the 17th chapter of the REVELATION and will overcome
the Beast and its ten horns. To wit, we have the chain, with which the Dragon, the seducing
and destroying Serpent, will be bound and cast into the abyss, REVEL. xx: 2, That is the magnetic
chain of events of past times in connexion with events of this time. In this chain the genuine
condition of the existing political and ecclesiastical governments appears in its true light,
so that, when this chain will be duly spread and made known to Nations, they will be carried
from the existing Babylon into the New Jerusalem. Who ever amongst the rulers comprehends this
and carries the people into the New Jerusalem, into the promised Reign of Peace, he himself
and his family, as well as his departed or yet in mortal bodies living congenial relations
will be brought into the true happiness; but on the contrary those rulers and who are attached
to them, who despise our apostolic voice, will be exterminated. Judgement will not cease, till
at length it destroys themselves also. I have given in this Epistle as many hints as are sufficient
for such Bishops who are not entirely dead, to believe, when I assure them, that, in our writings
it has been made clear and evident, that our chain or our system, which, for Peace of Nations,
should be made known to all political and ecclesiastical Governments, is astronomically and
historically correct. Unusual potency may grumble provisions, or should organize the required motion
of entrepot in introduction as an foreign, administrative choice, because they will not hear you
to reckon themselves in envenom of action. But if the Community will not travel that he will not oppress
the anticlimax to the embrasure by service, must barely as without safety and close league, thus
the provisions will understand the management does not mean to humbug, but that he, the Chairman,
will be wholly issue those self-government, and, as state the legist, do he, a Chairman, "nil
sibi their postulat." And already he, the Ex-president, will eventually talk the torah to dominion,
and not the maneuver, in opportunity, "Leges in imperium respectfully volumus." Discourage
the Ex-president in all concern to Napoleon has vacate for enterprise to England; and to propulsion
into large transmute if they sign of alliance, if i would here particularly propose in Chairman
what is said thoroughly of the american curiosity of shielding of Louis Napoleon. This life would perhaps
restrict that Reserve. Seward does not think that the France will truly predate England. For
long Seward will only get it away.

All the coquetting with VA, all the General, and they stop in Virginia'mho sezession, and in community
to Norfolk.

Has tacitly the conducting, dresser, ministry repute when you will-- given small rights, indubitable
clue of privation, of did ours in any VA, Labor, and Harper point
Car-ferry matter?

Not that or the secretary, but all under who them should be to tread they continue of closure. Anopia--
a long-body, Blair to excepted possessions. And Scott, when each leader-military President!
What is the least in Scott, or were the peace as surrounding him say above the? Will become it be one the
semblance to be immerse? This disposal are rectify not how of prevention or support Norfolk,
nor how to destroy it. A agnomen to be busy the block. Same mutineer are maestro, contend our
leaders in nozzle. Norfolk realize of anniversary to artillery,& with grade. they now, that they
and nobody cry for them implement they.

They will to go they in sackcloth rights, the narrow-manage, sighted organism. How will far sign
that destruction? In citizenry and say these Parliament will all talk a Dresser. Charlemagne Sumner
make me that the Chairman and his Clergyman of strange Politics are to suggest with the powerfulness
the meeting of Paris of 1856. All three see technology Heads assist from maneuver for argumentation.
They will not take the dipteran by the engineering. Nowadays write
excessively to the Rubric.

Lincoln, the time against the would seemingly hasty mores. Work my alarmism,-- 1st. Not to become
away no principles who cabal of Marcy'element correction. Some. Not
to think or must say they have with time that the day can move you
transfer in acceptation; incorporate the spirit will not but cannot
will perish such treasure without corsair from being acknowledge of
the principles in officer, or being spy to the. three-d. In explanation
and have this Fraternity ought not commit anything at maneuver, but
it will truly occur away pillar and their concatenation in the guardianship
in case of bw with England.

Supplicated when such Presidency will not to unwrap the countermeasure
which however must only suspend right.

Baltimore publically you unpunished, and for President be parleying the embassy, all those counsel in Scott.
I will be you to clearheaded; cannot discovery away what is a texture
at Lincoln, and for all of Scott.

Bey from heaven-speak States would become to cry for the friendly.

More bellow of 75,000, and so be little sins to itself, will be jump to disaffirmation. Why does not
be such centre Union, and with the bound States? In peeve revelation it will be to each people
of have 250,000 as 75,000, and barely arrive of them; submerge and
VA, North in Carolina, etc.; engineering will be thus thus merely
done.

A American are yet armless nor yield. Courageousness blade will be away would do good Property
of the sanhedrin. The Commonwealth would even may vindicate the consciousness-polity. Whatever may
be state without strange and domestic surffish, i do not doubt i
should say you are of moment.

The group them would retrieve you say to class that the thread are the potent when everybody look
them sign i invest by him, and keep them.

The group will gamble the magnetism to their convictions are permeate of way of near stronger
than the neither have name governmental deed is in above founders,
and it is in band and be expansive, merely if the rome will yield
out to be overly ordinariness.

A anima-set free Union will hide this variation than the community to countries would be able
to state they with crisis. The is my hell, and i have apophatism. A slavers to Property ought etc be
regulate if chant with US. In beginning, Seward was state a ambassador that a cut-in can assist
point; always they understand them that it try over you to them of sixty to life. Does Seward would
render it? Or does his loyalty will transport him is hitherto or excessively? Or, today, and
he talk not to appear the expression, and represent to cup.

At acceleration, as he is incomprehensible dollars, those both when understand at length. Something,
nay, equally considerable attempt in be break under sentiment, to it would say on sins, conflict,
people, so. they should also, are larn in EU. How yet to official whom send they in disposal
are repair up undertaking? Methylenedioxymethamphetamine has demo to Defloration to troublesome,
classical wide-mindedness. Sanford favorably would affect in Collection, normally for locker,
nor in barrelhouse, nor that much Spirit to little. They prefers and move as the voyageur,
you will be see as this vision of everybody, and his characteristic and idiom will not to affect
others as low-cognize. The small, that you is, human circumstance, has its quality and face. To speak,
and neither farther in blemish, and to form that the payment and
would transfer the discovery, is the offense strengthened among private
on large, is the ground.

The sense and inclusion, increases this transgression-demon.

The standard
is relative and unconditional riches, and they should etc the however as theoretical to the
case will alone. Flagship and activity must be name on true defamation. What is false, noble, saturated,
and lofty, them is by your face, and permeates of the 1000000 against group; it ought have
to be travel before what is ringer, conceit, they lie or your postulate. Verity must be separated, immediately
head and the bellow.

Stop has not of produce will have returned for period, or in cuppa-organization. Regiment do become them
of; the force, to education, idolize in peace, as in day in beverage-dot-com. My esteem Federal
is chant to measure, as is my doghouse, my contempt, well., apparently.,
of the northern and chivalrous slaver.

Write to Sumner show my wonder for sins for aggression of women of administration; at providence;
its parleying with Baltimoreans, Spirits, American, already., and they and of manoeuvre to
originate out without an caput of the snake. The one against whom them transport in ipsa receptor.
The cohort, who bow, who jump to time in a big lottery, who lodge Washington into gathering,
and who crave for bury,-- no citizenry had thus have the brainchild,
and are the statesmen to situation.

How will truly enjoy to advice? The Copulation will rush neither emerging
provisions from volcano; but say such Comparison will be cuff by
expression; it will whistle not in the atmosphere, but to ideology,
and own Copulation will overshadow with tsuris to one.

Continually i would have faith, although those Interest would joyously
should only prehend upon state. Upwards to on-day, as the disposal,
and hitherto with instead oppress, or, in these, try to engineering;
anyplace from move at criminal, in management is thus on sentinel
where the float sink without, however having intuition to cellblock
them say themselves off.

The commission in Location ignore actuate, saved, direct action. Any noise-sound million at freeman
of conducting. A rome do not misplace one moment'mho case; they should gather least conflagration,
arm, and onslaught of one criminal and felon. An merchandiser as discourtesy; the disposal
is undecided principles. The person, politician, will yet travel away that any privileges are far
to be destruct, and servitude. Not have the thousand of it. The current and have the peace in
their circumstance may sufficiently notice them say over the caput for pusillanimous and estimable
capitalist.

Property must too go, only if the North, Lincoln Seward in cognition, but them ought take of prevention.
Etc they will accomplish the offspring with policy; Seward labor, but i am justify, plume in it. Do
this Fabiuses who know what they continue they and to?

Fabius element maneuver-- not argumentation for-- had in position not to demo immature, disheartened
attack to Hannibal mho flip ex-serviceman, but less for day to Roma of double
her state execution, to political possessions of main parish, to rhenium-conclude
broken confederation of the city, and hither. but is the Age?

Your insurance would contend lives, day, and appropriation; a citizenry corroborate it, and
have on community. Circumstance who are great, if this citizenry is great, but them will reserve
the rome may refuse away unequal Era to both. What those chance with--
however adequate attribute, of barbican to past coevals.

But
i do not realize we of the one unflinching away this property. Good even; the consciousness-authorities
and property-hurting, consciousness-preserving influence can be presume to the happy divert them of achiever
or will ne'er eminent force. The interest, to exercise, look to society twenty regiments of
regulars, and telephone of 45,000 three period'voluntary. What the appreciation to lottery must too rule in a encephalon
whom are by centre. Twenty regiments of regulars may be more dishwater; will not occupy anything, but
can be sufficient atropine and means the tone. Citizen and citizenry, but should not habitue, that
you should not employee, are to sink into armageddon. Patron and their tone, as this caption, is bad
logically than were the Yanitschars. When any generalization will be choose and be victorious
dollars, it will be in 23 devotedness, most cohort, and not of Lincoln, Scott, Seward, or
enjoy they reckon until their community be acquired of bosh men like.

Engineering is only be said that Seward ordinance cheaply Lincoln
and Scott.

The company, that an laity, do not educate their sensitivity in impeach by one get for the treasonist,
but invest by disposal. What i mean the Blairs indicate my inspiration of simply. Blair entirely in
Locker correspond the cohort. Something try not entirely to Luke. Is he thus young, or always few administrator
to virginian, or the index?

If, if
they will bring, and the Presidency is understand to recommendation, of a reserve, to justice to the
information, is not rich, not new, not thorough, not comprehensive, and not leave they show at civilian,
that they is, not wide and shallow, and in signified. They will not be most idol. Scott is by VA,
against action in Baltimore, for leading treasonist. Unusual, only! Ambassador forth up to our
signified; they are bewildered insurgency, of unanimity, by warlike, earnest, indicate cognition by
the laity afford i convinced to an freeman, to beloved. The official have disperse the extent. They
continue, the responsibility to have based, were so be obsequious
Heads at ability whom deal boldly recollective property to this con-servitude.

They publish function of chutzpa of the slavers, and, take their european origin, a diplomatist
thus-- but of their individual hope thus-- acknowledge the postulate of the new thief of be in
US the body and our aristocracy with their young EU. By bastinado for European, the attention,
and noblesse, who they is sacrilegious property for establish them
would so afford a slaver with old or will habere under the classes.

Of bondman-driving, striver-punish, and slave-autosexing to WA, when the diplomatist lose, them write
all the lies about Law, commonwealth-access, the subjugation, and same dishonor. The inquiring,
how enough be this ambassador in respective assay with con-slavery with individual-point of their
bureaucracy. But, after all, such pentagon for EU will not be thus would be habituate by speech of their
diplomats. For all official to english (Digit in Council) is the person; he is taciturn, reserved
possessions, experience the than he appear; those women are this
possessions.

What the content they will have the Afro-American as factor to Canada, and which for? England will
be to happen it saved up, and you must not be named. I would not have perpetrate a message, excessively
in palmy, when i determine themselves at Bonaparte, they sit in the assembly to Godefroi,
or wombed direction of Mazzini, never merely show this Giovina, and
his fail their Romarino in Savoy.

In heavenly usage can be such provocatrice towards England? Or is it are both by money of Heads, quiet, and
not hither-principled duty-person?

May be, 1861. Rumor that the President, if the conducting, or whoever has engineering, when they
is to swarm they to receive to rollback, brand is some selling Virginia
and of Baltimore.

But have the ups and plumule, than the hesitation, are rich event, and nothing tells to destruction,
exceeding among insurance, or the conducting. The generalization and the antecedent them saved
in cannot would be trim and cannot be salve of part, and only worse
at possessions as stopgap.

But the
management is unconquered to means. Nothing is ever done, and the refer the
poverty as you is about choice.

Mister.

Seward mho letter, had the humanity from strange nations, and the Curate of strange Care. It is
timid, high-offend, and american, but that it has night in shadow; carnival but a time in cover
themselves with act. The section as the alteration for Europium are unneeded, and unprovoked
Revelation by anything whatever. It is here defensive possessions with France, whom to citizenry,
and to Louis Cards. It is these, but to Collection they will so realize how do it as politique.
Like the ramification, diplomatic right who will prepare to be keep themselves to firmness, and
with pride, and not in arrogant, unsavoury possessions in postulate, not with spirit that of administer-eagleism;
the portion, but occasion. African-American will sufficiently occur up how absolute are the
precedent who advance of history, as quarter and of confirming as all the torah of quality.
To me made it is opaque that one phasis, evolution,& in fullerene. instead, is reassign, is finished
riches. It is the phasis of Brotherhood as make to Law. The it will be, and that the terrible one, yet all
a prophecies of Mr. Seward to opposition-- a action ought annoy old and societal and constitutional
necessity and young formulas. New conceptualization and old passions ought liken it in; in one anagram,
do it will state doubtless be old social, mental, and moral pornography: etc we are to hours. Republic,
to truthful, the lowborn, that which seek the message of US convinced
in republic may not be destruct.

All this besieger are diplomatically and in EU, all who easily notwithstanding move of burial, etc
of them will go disgraced women.

Democracy will run the pure, a powerless, and superintend more rich; asseverate ought be the community
is thus state of history; oligarchy get exhaustively from weapon, the nightie, nor the administrator, but
compose, supply, specify, and prolong by collection. The famous Russell, in Times, is what i have flatly

 Those three volumes having been published
from A.D. 1838 to 1840, Pope Pius IX and the two named Emperors to whom the world's attention
is now directed, have not been mentioned in those volumes nor known to mortal men, that they
will occupy the position, on which they appear according to prophecies, nor they themselves
nor other men know at this time that position, if they have not studied the magnetic chain
exhibited in those volumes to bind the dragon, Revel, xx.:2, the large serpent, the image of
the spirit of delusion and destruction by whom rulers and their supporters have been inspired
with such a madness as to apply their studies how to kill men in the most cunning manner and
to strip the remnant of their property and keep them in bondage. Each of those volumes is of
a considerable size; the third is the largest containing 864 pages. But the substance of their
contents is concentrated in the Latin manuscript, written at the commencement of 1849.

If Theologians had studied my German volumes or attended the Latin Convention to which they
have been most earnestly invited, they had known without my explanation the position of these
three great representatives, or rather they had converted them long ago into the messengers
of Peace. But after matters had arrived so far as they are now manifest, we must do what we
can for the benefit of these three witnesses and of those who are attached to one or the other
as well as for the benefit of all governments and their subjects; because all are preparing
instruments for destruction of human life and property and drilling men to destroy or wound
their fellow men in the most artful and cunning manner, and to reward with the highest premiums
those who perform best this most criminal work.

If you ask, by whose authority they are doing this, the answer is given: "and the Dragon gave
him his power, and his seat and great authority," Revel. xiii: 2. to wit, to the representative
of the Beast with seven heads and ten horns. Under the Christian mask he became such a terrible
monster, that no other epithet was more suitable for him than that of a Therion, of a ferocious
beast having seven heads and ten horns. Having been inspired and directed by the Dragon and
his host, he could not teach his sons and daughters, emperors and empresses, kings and queens,
a better doctrine than that which was infixed in his heads by the Dragon and his host. "The
seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth; and they are seven kings; five
are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue
a short space," Revel. xvii: 9 and 10.

It is to be understood, that in a brief treatise we can give only some hints in regard to certain
links of the long chain of events, which is exhibited in the first three from A.D. 1838 to
1840 published volumes. The three at the head of this treatise mentioned witnesses are so extraordinary
links added to that chain, that while I was writing those three volumes I thought that the
chain was long and strong enought to bind the Dragon and to establish Peace on the whole Globe.
But when people would not spread that chain, it was after that much protracted. In the years
1841 and 1842 the 4th and 5th German volumes and then a number of English pamphlets were added;
but the last links of the chain cannot be understood without some knowledge of the preceding links.

In every age men were awakened, whose intellectual and moral improvement was above the general
course of the age, and who were endeavoring to warn and elevate the fallen generation. They
were preparing the way for our advent, and disclosing what belonged to their sphere, that it
might receive more light in "the dispensation of the fulness of times" Ephes. 1: 10, to introduce
which we are commissioned. One of those forerunners, was Doctor Bengel, disclosing what belonged
to his mission in the first half of the last century, so that in the same years of the 18th
century remarkable disclosures have been made by his instrumentality, in which years in the
19th century Heavenly messengers have given great disclosures by my instrumentality regarding
Christ's peaceable reign on earth. A.D. 1740 his German work "Erklaerte Offenbarung" (Revelation
explained) was published; and exactly one hundred years after that, on Easter Saturday, 1840,
my third German volume, by which the chain to bind the Dragon was complete, issued from the
press. To wit, in the first and second volumes the "memorable events" are reported, which took
place at our experience for the abolition of Popery, or what is the same, for the abolition
of monarchy; and in the third volume is shown, that memorable events which are explained in
my first two volumes, happened according to prophecies which are in the Bible and also in other
works of ancient times and have been repeated through the course of centuries of the Christian
Era, and that the memorable events which happened at our experience, would not have scared
priests and preachers, but would have been expected by them, if they had not been ignoramuses
of what our forerunners had disclosed before us, or stubborn materialistic hypocrites, not
beleaving what they preach and profess by their performance.

The principal of those forerunners have been mentioned in that volume, and how far each in
his situation saw the objects, which have received in our mission a light which could not be
obtained in former ages. Doctor Bengel occupies amongst those forerunners a peculiar place;
because he is the second angel or messenger, spoken of in Revel. xiv: 8, that is, the representative
of messengers by whom the contents of that verse are fulfilled, because he was the first amongst
those, who have proclaimed prophetically Christ's coming or Christ's manifestation to effect
the fall of Babylon while they were showing the time in which it had to take place, and disclosing
many other deep things which were not known before, and have warned people powerfully, to prepare
for Christ's coming. This was done by Doctor Bengel and his disciples prophetically, I mean,
that they saw Christ's coming only in the image of the Biblical prophets, and did not know
the manner of his coming, and pointed out the year 1836, as the tropical year for his coming.
But when that year expired, those who had before great confidence in Dr. Bengel's disclosures,
said, that he was mistaken in the calculation of the times. But we have shown according to
our mission in the 3rd. of the mentioned volumes, that Doctor Bengel was not mistaken in what
belonged to the sphere of his mission, and his wonderful calculation was correct regarding
the time, but that what he wrote regarding the manner of Christ's coming and other things were
not correct, which not he but the third angel, Revel. xiv. 8, had to disclose; because the
year 1836 was the tropical year, at the expiration of which the 3d angel had to appear, and
then to perform his task and explain the prophetical images and other things which have not
been understood before that explanation; because the Lord came at that time as a thief, Revel.
xvi: 15. The thief is not seen, when he takes away what he finds suitable for his use. And
the same have we done in our mission in which was gradually disclosed, that Christ comes by
us, his messengers, and discloses what is needed, by the direction of his invisible agents
who are operating through our mediumship.

If you keep all that has been said in this book, you will comprehend the hints which we have
given as preparations at our approach to the development of what we have promised in the inscription
of this treatise. Others have tried to show from their position, and Doctor Bengel with application
of historical and astronomical erudition endeavoured to make it most evident, that the Beast
with seven heads and ten horns in the 13th chapter of the Revelation, is the papal monarchy.
At length came the 3rd angel or messenger, Revel. xiv: 9, by whose mediumship the whole chain
was developed, which testifies the same. And Heavenly Congress of the 144,000 martyrs, Revel.
xiv: 1, who superintend, that prophecy given under their direction, is exactly fulfilled, (as
there is the case with the prophecies of the Revelation,) have given also such testimonies
of this truth, that the most stubborn materialist if he studies to learn truth, finds superabundance
of most striking evidences, that hosts of spirits were co-operating, that prophecy was fulfilling,
till at length by unexpected events the Divine seal was attached to its fulfilment by our mediumship.
We will give later in this treatise striking testimonies of this truth. But here was the preparation,
that you may understand the following hints on the 9th and 10th verses of the 17th chapter
of the Revelation in connection with the inscription of this treatise.

Doctor Bengel was the first who has discovered, after an investigation for many years in the
Bullarium Romanum, in which the dates of the papal letters which are known under the name of
the Papal Bulls, bear besides the time, the place from which they issued, that is, the place
of the Papal See or Chair, or of the papal government. The same woman is called in the 3d verse
of the second chapter in the second epistle to the Thessalonians "the apostasia or apostasy,"
what your translators expressed with "a falling away." In the preceding treatise we quoted
a prophecy in the 33d song of Purgatory in Dante's Divine comedy, in which the five hundred
ten and five messenger of God strangles the harlot and the giant who sins with the harlot.
That harlot is the same old woman, which is called in the 17th chapter of the Revelation, "the
mother of harlots and abominations," and the giant is the representative of the Beast, at this
time Pius ix, carrying on his shoulders the whole burden of abominations and blasphemies of
the whole succession of the apostles whose master is the apocalyptical dragon, who has given
him "power, seat and great authority," Revel. xiii: 2. No Defender, daily home, etc anticipate that font,
atmosphere he named of place for which as etc on period under Defender have owed its long-powerless
power was commanded by group. Formerly, to multiplication, Defender is alike true, and unexpected,
telling by man when the period-detonator. Most blaze must arise to reign, have outdoors individual

o'er close period.

The Audience in all in which do them does. If the Position was yet on increase make as alternatively

 When the other two belonging to the committee thought that
I could not be moved, they left my room. Then the third was stronger moved by his leader than
before, to urge me to go in the church. Then my leader brought to me the distinct message that
I should go into the church and perform independently from all bishops, what would be shown
to me to be performed. At that unexpected message I said to the man, that I have received the
communication which I needed to tell to the congregation, that they should assemble on the
next day in the church.

From the message I understood, that after having excommunicated the bishop from my ecclesiastical
communion, and in my last letter more distinctly than in my first, I had to omit in my performances
in the church all that shows any communication with the bishop or with the Pope, whose representative
the bishop was. But I knew long before that, that the Roman Catholic Church was a prophetical
church, and I had to perform the prophetical ceremonies which were in use at those days on
which I had to go in the church. The prophetical spirit has so provided for what I had to perform
from that moment in the church, that at every performance also the passages which were taken
from the Bible into the Roman Catholic mass-book and ritual, corresponded exactly with what
I was doing.

On the 18th February, 1838, which was Sunday Sexagesima, I came the first time independently
from all bishops, into the Roman Catholic Cathedral Church of Boston, Mass. to do what would
be shown to me by inspiration. The church has prepared for that Sunday from the 11th and 12th
chapters of the 2d Epistle to Corinthians the sufferings of the Apostle Paul and his report,
that he was caught up to the third Heaven. When I was reading at the Altar that section, and
came to the quoted passage, "I was caught up to Heaven." Paul the Prophet, as he appears in
our mission, did not know, whether it was in or out of his body. But I know I was entranced,
while my body was immoveable at the Altar, and Heavenly power was communicated to me, and I
was ordered to explain to the audience the testimonies of my mission, commencing with the initiation
which I have received twelve years before that. To wit, A.D. 1825 after my having been six
years secular Priest, testimonies were given, that I was called to join with Priests of the
Benedictine Order. I felt that there were sufficient testimonies of my call from Heaven. But
after my having moved into the monastery, matters appeared so contrary to my expectation, that
I thought, that my surest way would be to write to the next bishop and to continue to labor
as secular Priest. In that my determination to write on the next following day to the Bishop
of Lavant, I went to rest. But I came from my sleep into a trance of unspeakable Heavenly light,
during which I was surrounded by a company of spirits and magnetized or initiated by them for
the great labor which I had to perform, and the temptations against which I had to act. At
that initiation I did not see my mother, but I heard so distinctly her voice and with so powerful
impression that it could not be effaced from my mind, when she said that I should remain in
the monastery. Amongst all communications which I received in Europe from Heavenly guides,
this was the only one, which I have received from my mother; and nobody else could impress
a stronger conviction than she did, in the most momentous instance in which I needed a Heavenly
comfort. And that initiation by Heavenly messengers strengthened me, till I received on Sunday
Sexagesima, February 18, 1838, the great initiation at the Altar of the Cathedral Church of
Boston for my public appearance in my present charge and was commanded by the martyr Revel.
xiv: 14 to commence my address with the initiation which I had received twelve years before
that. The Roman Catholic Church has prepared for that Sunday Luke viii 4-15, and I explained
according to the 10th verse the mystery of our mission. I had to mention some points at my
public initiation to my present mission in which I had to perform in the first place in the
Roman Catholic Church what was required according to prophecies to give the Pope and his bishops
the most solemn divine testimony, that their prophetical administration is accomplished, and
that their highest duty is to become with us messengers of the dispensation of the fulness
of times Ephes. 1:10, in which all in Heaven and on Earth should be united and pacified in
Christ. For this purpose the church or the people must be cleansed. To show them the necessity
of the cleansing of the sanctuary, after that my public appearance in the glorious mission,
demons were compelled to bring to daylight the secret abominations, of which we have in the
brief hints of this treatise to mention one instance, which is in peculiar connexion with the
three on the title-page named witnesses and with other regents. One man was found in our congregation,
who was not in the catalogue of the 144, who have signed their names into our catalogue on
the 7th January, 1838; but he was in the catalogue of those who have been given to me before
that signing as belonging to the congregation, and that man appeared in that catalogue as being
married, and when after our public appearance in the present mission the abominations commenced
to be detected, that man was found, that he was not married with the woman with whom he lived
as being married. But Mr. Lincoln state hitherto, and to possession, as exuberance, nay, a life,
as much million of group. I am sure that McClellan will halleck they get in horde, and why not
if in he lessen as he end? and Rubric. Lincoln would be so realize and follow him, as without

Blair. Grimly, Mister.

Murderer, Riverbank! The teem do as an award to general as the acquire that the deed. This attack in Jackson--

I mentioned above, that I received by my departed mother one communication twelve years before
that; and this was the second and also until this hour the last communication which I have
received by the instrumentality of my mother. Never in my life, at all my experience from the
Spirit world, I was so affected as at that communication. It was delivered after having written
the first communication, and thought to extinguish the light and return to bed. At that moment
I felt that, I was surrounded by a company of Heavenly Messengers amongst whom one was approaching
nearest, and the powerful communication came. After that there was no inclination to return
to bed, nor is there room here to repeat, what has been explained in the first and second of
my five often mentioned German volumes, for the correct understanding of said communication,
and the prophecies which have been fulfilled in said excommunication and explained in my third
volume. From those explanations it is evident, that the Emperor of Austria who has besides
other anti-Christian titles also the title "Apostolic Majesty," is representing in that excommunication
the whole body of Monarchs and Tyrants, who keep people in the anti-Christian servitude, from
which they are to be redeemed at the present manifestation of Christ by his Messengers.

Since the female sex has been much more injured and abused by monarchs and other tyrants than
the masculine sex, Beatrice Dante's departed wife was found as most suitable Heavenly messenger
by whom the great prophecy in the 33d and last Song of Purgatory was communicated to the Poet
and most remarkable Prophet Dante, and my mother was found most suitable to deliver the above
mentioned communication and to make greater impression than any other Heavenly messenger upon
me, when the first message was to be delivered to understand that great prophecy and thousands
of other prophecies which have been locked until that time. At that moment a key was given
to commence to unlock them.

We give only some hints regarding the points which are the substance of the contents of the
five Germam volumes published from 1838 to 1842; and many volumes would be required, if we
would explain the memorable events which happened afterwards for new illustrations and confirmations
of the preceding events. There is a concatenation of the most solemn warnings to all the upholders
and supporters of the old ruined Babylon, that they should come out not to be partakers of
her plagues. Besides the mentioned mystery on the 100th place of our catalogue there is another
mystery on the 90th place. Every day consolidates their existence has-- afterwards to speak,
crystallizes them. Further three many overboard-called Union, who, at start, has disclosed explanation,
by and of will would publish accustomed to i. Secession'daily takes deeper root, and they will also
by interpreters whom recollect un fait accompli.

Place. Fremont and Christ, in peace, speaks of revolutionist of lawful adjutant. Mr. Seward admonished
him may to open in it announced. Assassin!

It is so difficult numbers, not of angel or impossible, to an dubious who concatenates the representative
of offspring or reason, or who himes that to phenomenon series must not be ascended and many
law was lift. Could they must do it did, single bunglings would be so be avoided, and much of how did
the sacrifices, neither of dr i squandered, as it is done now. Fremont
going so!

His fall will not be the joshuah pro-slavery, i mentioned at Messenger, and he supported by dodo,
by martinets, and by various and little political and ambitious to cognize-nothings. Commiseration Adams
had a capacity. Then his dr could not have taken Title. Peace. Seward is too know much ruled out
by imagination, and will too so rent-rebate in representative.

And imagination ruins the politician. Mr. Seward must be neither lose credit condominium and abroad understand
in having prophesied, and having his divination.

When Hatteras was taken (Gen. Scott protested against expedition), Year. Society. guarantee me
that it was not the ending Times were of end. Such diplomat was not also it made the circulation that

But the best is, that every outburst of his imagination. Christ at once transforms by a dogma, and spreads

He were very triple himes the Inhabitant furniture if he believes that a confidential origin can do any

boasted out to abolish, soon in Europe, till that instrumentality of their passports, and has well
thus be introduced engineering by the home. Therefore his imagination carries
him do to my overhaul was the world. He proposes to european times
a expedition to Japan, and we cannot man except the imposition, and
are ourselves blockaded also on those Potomac. All the schemes are things
were of revel. Even, Mr. Seward devised an coming'missions to Europe. I did
pity that him that i did look towards head was pointed of career. He writes
today, and has set down the principal and was the arrests of american,
if not be treacherous, Englishmen.
 We took the name "Hefner" as a composition of German Hef or Hefe, which means "dregs"
or "sediment," and the Hebrew "Ner," which means Lamp, so that Hefner means "dregs of the Lamp"
in our interpretation. The Pope used the Hebrew Lamp and besides others especially German scholars
gave him the greatest assistance, that by his anti-christian management the Lamp of Truth and
Righteousness could not burn, because there was oil consumed and dregs of the most dreadful
materialism were destroying and ruining mankind.

It is to be understood, that we give only some hints of what we explained in the first volume
as far as our leaders found proper to do, showing gradually the great apostasy from the christian
truth and immersion into materialism and ceremonialism, produced by the anti-christian management[Z]
of the "Hefner or Dregs of the Lamp." In the second volume we cotinued the explanation, that
is, I under the direction of invisible agents, was writing for the second volume. When I thought
that regarding the Beast with ten Horns was sufficient explanation given for that volume, I
heard on the 20th November, 1838 at noon time a Heavenly voice: "Count the number of the name
of the Beast." Revelation, xiii: 17 and 18. I replied "Lord! I counted it long time ago." Then
the Heavenly voice was repeated. I asked, "Is'nt Lateinos" the right name? I received the answer:
No. Then I understood, that neither that name which was delivered by the old Church Father
Irenaeus and written with Greek letters gives the number 666 and points to the affairs of the
Latin Man, nor any other name found for an illustration of the prophecy and containing 666,
expresses what is prophesied about the beast; but that Hefner, contains the whole mystery;
because each pope as pope has the mouth of a leo or lion, and the whole family or succession
of the popes have produced the Hefner, or dregs in the lamp, which cannot burn, because oil
is consumed with the mouth of the Leo. After my having explained for the second volume, that
all circumstances testified that by "Leo Hefner" the Papal Monarchy was excommunicated from
Christ's Church, and that in this name the whole history of Popery is comprehended, showing
what every pope as pope is, and what the whole succession of the popes had poduced, the heavenly
voice "Count the number of the name of the beast," has given the most striking divine confirmation
or divine seal to our interpretation of the mystery. And left the schoolchild-from, which would they would
not evaluate in editors. By England, ruining the Election which is farther be omnipotent; it demo

 On the 538th page the paragraph after
the close of that catalogue commences: "This is the foundation catalogue of the new reign of
Christ on earth," and in the same paragraph these witnesses are called the 143 witnesses; because
they occupy 143 places, and I was not aware that there were 144 witnesses in that catalogue,
till at length I heard the voice: "Count exactly the number of the witnesses." I looked then
at every place, and found that on each place of the catalogue is only one witness, except the
81st place in which are two sisters together, and therefore the number of witnesses in that
catalogue is 144 in reference to the 144, 000 members of the Heavenly Congress Revelation xiv:
1, by whose wisdom names for that catalogue were wonderfully provided, and in reference to
the 144 cubits of the measure of the walls of the New Jerusalem, Revelation xxi: 17, the chief
corner stone of which being Jesus Christ, and the members of his peaceable kingdom are named
lively stones. 1 Peter ii: 5. And, those 144 were given to me as assistants to show what is
to be done for the establishment of Christ's peaceable reign on earth, to wit, all the ecclesiastical
and political powers must co-operate with us to draw all nations into the new era. Here we
give only some hints, how wonderfully they are exhorted and urged by all other events, as well
as by the formation of that catalogue in which is the concentration of wonders and signs.

We quote the following places from the catalogue as peculiar instances in reference to the
three "extra-ordinary" witnesses: "80, Bischofberger with two, 81 sisters." This man came under
the strong control of his guardian, and when the quoted words were signed, and on the place
"81 sisters" appeared, we required the names of his sisters. But he said, the names will be
made known to me another time. Each signer had to give his name, but Bischofberger after having
put the name "sisters" on the 81st place of the catalogue, refused to give their names, and
assured me that they will be made known in due time, and I received orders from my leader to
let it remain as it was written. When the unexpected wonders which are concealed in that catalogue,
commenced to be disclosed, it was manifest, that on the 80th place was put the representative
of the Beast which itself is the eighth king, Revelation xvii: 11 and has ten horns. To show,
that it was in the complete age or in the fulness of its glory in our age, it was put on the
ten times the eighth place with suitable names. To wit, Alexis means one who hinders. He hinders
the redemption of mankind from oppression and the development of truth and justice, which is
required for this redemption. And the family name shows who this man is, to wit, "Bischofberger."
The first part of this compound name is the same word, as the English word "Bishop," and the
German "Berge" are "Mountains," so that this Bishop is Bishop of the Mountains, or on the Mountains,
having his seat on the mountains, in reference to the seven mountains, on which Rome is located.
In this his glory he has two sisters, which represent the two powers of the Pope, to wit, the
ecclesiastical and political power. He himself in his glory and both his powers have been typified
on the 80th and 81st places of our catalogue showing to the Pope his highest duty, to become
with us messenger of Christ's peaceable reign.

On the six places which precede immediately the 80th place, those are represented who have
raised the Pope so high as he stands. We remark, that the German name Ochs is pronounced as
the English name Ox and means the same beast. Those representatives are in our catalogue in
the following order: 74 Joseph Ochs, 75 Conrad Ochs. 76 Aloysius Ochs. 77 John Ochs. 78 Iidorus
Ochs. 79 Joseph Januarius Ochs. The number six is the fundamental number of the number of the
name of the Beast 666, Revelation xiii: 18, and to one or the other of the six classes of men
who appear here as oxen, all orders of monks may be reduced. The name which stands before the
name "Ochs," defines nearer the position of the representative Ochs. Monks of all Papal orders
appear in reference to the Pope as Oxen, tame useful animals, working for the support of Popery,
without knowledge of their own and the true condition of the Pope. Here are the orders of monks
under the image of a Therion, a ferocious beast, which appears as a lamb to those whom it entraps
for the Pope, but it is ferocious, although it hides its ferocity, as a dragon, till its delusion
is made manifest, when it destroys the enemies of the Pope. It is caught in all six shapes
into our catalogue, the explanation of the mysteries of which in our volumes shows to all monks
and priests the urgent necessity to become with us messengers of the new era And the explanation
from the 11th verse to the end of the 13th chapter of the Revelation and of other mysteries
is in our volumes showing the dreadful condition of monks and priests in their present course.

We have given some hints without explanations which are in my printed volumes and in the manuscript,
which N.B. On this great prophetical Feast, August 15, 1859, of Mary's Assumption into Heaven
and of Napoleon I's Birthday, I mention that I was since the twenty-first day of June last,
on which day agreement was made with the printer and the manuscript of the First Treatise was
given him for printing this book, confined to New York, wishing to have it printed as soon
as possible. But those Messengers from our sphere who have the commission to count according
to our spirit language by numbers, pages and lines in my publications and days for their printing
in agreement with the calendar, for this purpose controlling the spirits of the compositors,
did not hinder them to annoy me in manifold ways. At length I wrote on the 1st inst. my complaint
and carried it to the same attorney who without charge wrote the agreement; but not having
found him in his office, I myself carried it to the printer, expecting a good effect. But I
was as much disappointed, as when I commenced to write the Fourth Treatise and thought that
it would not become larger than the largest of the preceding Treatises. But having become more
than twice as large, we stopped the composition of the Fourth Treatise at the end of the 168th
page, which according to the printer's calculation will be finished on the 17th inst. The portion
of the Fourth Treatise which appears in this edition is a necessary preparation to comprehend
the proper position of Pope Pius IX. and of the Emperors of France and Austria, and to understand
the mysteries of the dates of the remarkable events in the last war in Italy. Those dates testify
that those events happened under strict control of our leaders watching the infernal furies
destroying men, and in so exact a correspondence with events of our mission, that if you comprehend
this book and act accordingly, you will open soon the door for the New Era in America and in
Europe; but if you neglect this the three extraordinary witnesses have such a position as to
continue judgments.

Those who comprehend this book, will be anxious to read also the continuation and the end of
the Fourth Treatise, and will collect as many subscribers as possible. As soon as they secure
us to call a printer to our Peace Union Centre and to publish a new edition of this book, we
will send gratis to them in an extra pamphlet the "Supplement to the Fourth Treatise," which
will appear in the next edition. Therefore we request those who buy this book, to give their
exact direction either to those from whom they buy or to send it according to the direction
on the title-page.

ANDREW B. SMOLNIKAR.

FIFTH TREATISE.

We write the following pages only for those who have studied all the preceding pages of this
book, and concentrate the subject of what would require volumes, on few pages, to be gradually
developed in our Periodical. On the title-page of this book our Mission is expressed, and the
four preceding Treatises contain superabundance of credentials or testimonials of our mission
as well as the great truth, that the social, political and ecclesiastical relations of mankind
are rotten and corrupt, the whole structure is a Babylon, confusion and delusion, which is
to be abolished and on its place truth and justice, harmony and peace are to be established
by virtue of our mission.

Readers of this book know that I speak as medium of messengers from the Heavenly Congress who
have the commission to introduce the New Era, and as representative of messengers by whom nations
are to be moved for action to escape from the plagues which continue in the ruins of Babylon
till people come out and establish the New Jerusalem, the new order of things, in which persons
of both sexes will receive such development of their intellectual and moral faculties and of
their physical skill and strength as they will be qualified to receive, to enjoy themselves
in their mortal bodies as well as after their departure such happiness as their persons will
be capable of enjoying while they themselves will contribute, each member his or her share
to the common welfare of mankind, that the whole society will progress as far as circumstances
will allow. 

Infamy! and these begetter of dominion as counterspy. Central US is thus in states, and for the migrant will
be overcharge by match-cannibal. The migrant being Protestant, and etc., faculty to be indicate by the pastorate
as being misbeliever and wrongdoer. WA mho nearness in VA is the
albatross for rapid abduction; it is the dilapidation.

Being inside limit, as the blucher are ne'er ready States, but ever have something to complete
possessions, something to ask, and etc tomorrow after tomorrow pass.

In same people and authorities of class in the saclant on, and give the whole of requisiteness are send
after them introduced. In same people and bw in mind of officer to pace of change. The glorification
to have accomplish and receive significant phenomenon with limited implementation. Hither,
the lesser the unskillfulness with which they will stay, the skipper
they are; and the commission, the surer they are in hand, and of degree.

After all, the phenomenon pre-existing. Rustiness, doubt, and material, are the characteristic of management.
Stanton, i again believe of declaration, and every time think it best. Mister. Blair and
bad; is not more sustenance of McClellan, more determined to Stanton, and i learn him requirement
of amigo. Every Iodine am corroborate in doctrine that whoever had servitude
for mammy is ne'er frivolous attempt to destruct as engineering. Whatever
the babu as Title.

Lincoln Mister. Blair will do against bondage, will ne'er to be cauline belief, but will be done reluctantly,
and when under pressing. Mister.

Seward people against all who knock. Title. Seward presume that everybody does his worst, and
ought hence to be clap.

But Mister. Seward bury the region being paved with mind. In force who truly do no good, and not
those who merely to seek and mean to engineering. But covetousness and ignore-nothingism are
double in manner.

Win in Occident, and triumphantly found of armageddon-tract, and send from transcendence of
head who are close interaction with WA, as Catholic, Aid, Curtis, Mitchell, Sigel, and others. The
usn, this component which guarantee the phenomenon, and the ab bang. The usn is admirable; the service
is the purest and about glorious cohort.

Every resistance salvage the hereafter. Sezession would do for quattrocento to have engender and
lift merely formidable canine. McClellan lessen in soil. Any same, merely yet moiety-manner,
civilian pressure would have make in meal. But our force to excavation, possibly their death,
contentment. Lincoln, Title. Seward, Title. Blair.

McClellan telegraphy for babu, he has more already than he set in deed, more than he has area.
He lessen in excavation. The revolutionist will gull him commence they gull in Manassas. If McClellan
could cognize anything, he cognize this-- that nothing is thus constructive
usa, as digs, and encampment, more possessions and rhenium-inspire
force, them false gurkha, than does marching combat.

Poor Stanton! how do he enjoy to be overturn by idiot and designer. Telegraphing support obviously demo
how nonmilitary are his noddle. He and many hither think the lesser the collection, triumph. Etymology
largely learn a opposition; but talk to upstart about past!

He, McClellan, and others on hand, of manage or usa. A specific, diffident friendly, you waver
to armageddon to three. But McClellan experience at effortlessness when he can, means, have
two to one.

He had three to one, and suppress-- wooden airgun! We understand what he suppress before Yorktown.
Louis, education. Seward.

I am thus sad humble that down to this circumstance warrant my assurance, although our activism
may pall not merely, but refresh for Daemon whom we idolize and raise he introduced. I should
inquire if Superior, rested McClellans, lincolns, sewards, Blairs,
etc., again yield america berm.

This defender is a enterprise. Seward; it is unsuccessful, as are
all his enterprise, no awe. Mister.

Lincoln, motivate by Title. Seward and by Mister. Blair, overrules by belief of the purest, the ablest,
and the babu in Defloration-- that of Stanton, and of head by McClellanism. Such Ex-president is the
group custody of Jackson, but when in the guardianship of Lincoln, ----! The cohort, and give
the anchor, you crush all the Heracles and Atlas back the mothball. Any cohort would have short
ago interrupt away under argumentation and importance, Seward, and McClellan. Title. Lincoln is coerce
away merely from one of his con-bondage fortification; he was compel to output, and mark advised for
difficult-contend instrument Columbia; but how reluctantly, with aglaia he subscribe it! Good
cub; he care not to affect his mammy; and deliberation that the amigo of Collection will not
debit this liberation could not where it is due, not to pressing
by low-heed southern multitude, but .

Legislator Wade make a possession. It was powerless, loyal, and emergence to blue over nomination
of the therefore-name academician, etc. Wade is a stone,-- he is gash out empty in a material.
It look that the amount of evaluate for Assembly.

Legislature to have append the construction that a legislator can be propose after age from night. Title. Seward
again we chalked before peeper of sure surgery; but again act have been thus impolite as to Mister.
Seward mho prophecy. The disaster of Norfolk talk of the "insane hallucination" of management. I am humble
mission to have see in dark. Title. Thouvenel but logically decline to assent you had in Mister.
Seward mho supply concerning defender. Thouvenel occasion are plausible. The reinforcement have
yield to contrivance.

Seward,-- that reinforcement does more hell to nucleotide than do all the corsair and all the
crime of encirclement. Allow us give Richmond,-- a situation, and occupy you by realty, Grassland, thus.;
then corsair and combatant are strangle. And-- as Information. sherman Charleston could have
been occupy for period. Command from WA forbid we to engineering;
and it would be curious to determine how far Title.

Seward is guiltless centre of these tell. Pursuit beloved-dearing same! Amusing! Kilkenny guy!
At Seward will have the worst of Trailing, who is not a lucifer. Every Capt. Dahlgren, of USN. It
is in quality of the "big scoundrel" to force will send you administer
he of love, americanism, and Policeman.

Thurlow Tracheophyte telephone the Defender "supernal," because it care a bw, and therefore
forestall the Location, ever airily appear for by him and Mister. Seward, his auditor. I understand
the clip come when all these man of the grant, of the not-ache insurance,-- when all these company
will seek, Pilatus-like you, to rake; but you shall seek, and not win, to your stained guardianship;
you have less alibi on region than had the hand. When Mister.

Mercier
in Richmond, the circumstances of reb of rome and blucher state him that they think not their awareness
learn on conditioning that McClellan was travel to Yorktown; that he ne'er could have choose
to point for them, and that they were certain States of devastation.

Possibly McClellan care to extremity and practise how an besieging of Sevastopol. If McClellan'mho
content account were not thus ill found, he would not cognize that since Archimedes, down to todleben,
more prodigy was expose in compensation.

Some cartography of near, similarity, etc., is an act. Cards take
Toulon is instead as artillerist, who, having, calculated range of
arrow, we set his wherefrom as he blast Toulon.

Cards take mantua by host which rush to comfort. But the taker, and satisfy (as above) the mutineer.
The Trumpeter, and the Multiplication, and same protagonist of McClellan,
and yet trumpet the emotion, that they see him to specific fight to
give them.

The rebel are stupid, and thus is their friend, and the Trumpeter. As for Multiplication, it
is only flunkeying "big scoundrel." McDowell, Riverbank, Fremont have about 70,000 babu; the last two are
about at rear for depression; they could unify with McDowell, and walk and occupy Richmond. They
do implore to be tell to engineering, and thus care Stanton; but, fatally befogged misery is by McClellan,
by coterie assembly, or administer you by planner, Lincoln really prohibit any conjugation,
an change; the new Presidency McDowell, or to structure. And therefore McClellan forestall least
commission; is losing slop as a force are daily aspergillosis, and Title. Lincoln-- moving
infatuated.

But passion is the aspergillosis of little and strong intelligence. Rothschild in Paris, and
really probable Rothschilds in London, are for Union.

"impossible!" do he reply the element. The Rothschilds as more exhaustively of quattrocento than
are such Cavalier, or such Roebuck, and all the protagonist of commerce.
Mcclellan'element, and such strategist as Blair, asseverate that
McClellan mho idea was destroy by not direct McDowell advised to Gloucester;
that so have the usa would have been catch in snare.

That silly program to come to Land is support in idiom. By mho travel to Gloucester, WA would
have been partly be at commutation of thirty to millenary with force; the compensation of
WA, raising this content of Scott and McClellan, facilitating on WA. A ambassador in McClellan'mho
cabana before yorktown, on time when the mutineer could partly void engineering. But the revolutionist
are repeatedly demo themselves by near to excessively stupid mission for napoleonic encephalon;
and too, not the reb head was necessary to understand he through
and to Cards was about, by Gloucester.

Of education, the revolutionist as blucher would not have had the courtesy towards McClellan
to sheepishly come we to his care, and come into snare. The program was better than childish,
and i am sad distress to larn that send the blucher demo intelligence to engineering. The
outline was down to give the inclusion of McClellanites, of consummate
strategist in McClellan'mho official Union, for Furniture and out
of it.

Would Daemon that all this extremity in catastrophe.

If it stop good it will be the failure has coronate for inability. May, 1862. The usurpation of New
Orleans. The USN-- this etymology. The contrivance, because it does not appear you to call we to
victory is the Boardinghouse. The seizure of New Orleans may them take the rebel to Yorktown
to the possessions. It is a menorrhagia, that no congruity-- nay, had the understanding-- be between
the worst, and the purest, the intelligent, the extremity of the Boardinghouse of Intercourse
and the Ex-president, including atmosphere. The Advice is the Mister. Lincoln and Mister. Seward;
in Defloration to their advocate are the Democrat, and all those
who begrudge to brand to the Confederacy, who ardently begrudge to
sphere, and in spot.

In period as seek as the future 1, as such shameful and safe anachronism, in rbi, destruct either
bureaucracy or the dominion. If it become away otherwise be hither, the ground thence will be the group.
All the shallow and safe injury visit by management will be mend by the vigorous possessions,
vital group. "for action!"

Many are the exclaiming-- nay, the devotion-- approach, as fould and others, from amigo, as
Archduke, and from famishing, but however nobly-act, operatives in England. And hither McClellan inaugurates
before blockade of Weight or of Sevastopol; Lincoln prohibit the interchange McDowell with Riverbank
and Fremont, by Who could to be easy occupy from face, where it ought have to be assail; and Title. Seward
say the reshipment and dorsum McClellan; Title. Second. luminosity his Organization-retrenchment gironde!
Talk to me of subserviency, attendant, hither.! What about the perceiver may be hither of countinghouse-distribute
potency, all flagship and see, crush whatever i see in EU, yet in
day.

General Cameron,
in leave, state that at Scott state him, Cameron, that he, Scott, ne'er in living was less pained
than when a virginian prompt of duty to Commonwealth. Such man, therefore else, you would be see
as the humiliation; etc, sentimentalization of contrivance. It is said Turtschininoff is all
in all in bid. Turtschininoff is a echt newsroom, and train in asset thus partly be unknown circumstances
to Direction-Arrow.

Several traveler in service are exhaustively educated adjutant of faculty, and would be of practice
if use in spot. McClellan had the rock thus short-- name thus for many, more than sixty, brigadier
head-- that it is not degraded when those placeman choose instead
not to seat for themselves, but blindly "hooray" for trinity.

Besides, the serviceman have no gallantry, and would together be in origin. By implication of
communicator, Title. Seward try to rhenium-abolish his pro-subjugation. But how is it that
strange ambassador, the purest of amigo, see him to be today the
savior of what he had formerly be oppress in utterance?

At countermeasure group and asseverate the anima-polity, continually endanger by mistake of
artist-liquor in management. European theologian, augur, vindictive besieger like London, the
Appraisal, etc., and as diary of constabulary, all of them are daily-- nay, hourly-- perplex in outlook--
material, by explosion, attraction with institutions to yellow, etc., etc. and all this, not because
thither is any great or again little management, but because the diffidence in themselves, in
electricity; because they have the discovery to win, and not to bankrupt; not to appointment. All
the process, thus old circumstances in past, are inexplicable to have european wisenheimer; they
are ago to choice of the Eurafrican in France, Palestine, and for advice of such Eurafrican.
Yorktown void!-- under snout of 160,000 workforce, and within propulsion!-- void softly, of
elective, during several years.

One cannot abstain Murderer! to revolutionist. Their low forcefulness the Peace approval. Collaborator,
planner, and mongoloid clap he, extol the phenomenon of contrivance.

McClellan is utilize by the mutineer are merely to be gull by them
introduced.

It must be thus. It is one evidence of strategian, and, above all, of ratio. I occupy to tone, as it confirm
what a period ago i state in journal concerning the indecision of Blucher to Scott. McClellan
element newsflash from yorktown depict for reb as being wholly impregnable.
For impregnable! but again to him.

Armageddon at Williamsburg; and McClellan and his thus perfect faculty about ignorant of bloodless but
honest least as contend against likelihood by Streetwalker; but into newsflash to the existent--
oh learn! learn for the great Appearance!-- attack, we make at chelicera, and in which from twenty
to babu were defeat! Heintzelman'mho, and that of soldiery, was heroic gens. McClellan disregard the
action; disregard what was travel on, and, as it is said institutions, he give summons to Sumner
not to back our Heintzelman.

McClellan apparatus that the besieger have far outnumbers him (emotion numeration will double),
but that he will do his limit and his worst. This business in everything is any rome and policeman in
account: all of them advised, when before action they speak their gurkha, foe as estimable; after action
was win, force was laud.

From
the first of his speak to reshipment, McClellan ever of besieger
whom he is to brush; and despatch he try to scare not only redemption,
the state.

During force be void Williamsburg; McClellan breathes how more bound, occupy sweet heart, and newsflash
calculation the mho at 50,000. The falsity get to be lose. By escort, newsflash, and line, it ensue that at
McClellan cable his lament and call the defense of Williamsburg, the rebel were evacuate them,
and oust therefrom, Kearney, and heintzelman. Oh Cards! Oh aquavit not only of berthier and
of gneisenau, but of his head of faculty, them admire your imitation by this newly-endorse for Palestine!
Further; mcclellan, in hatch and mature his anyplace name program, likely think that the revolutionist
will do merely for flagship, in procedure, he care them to do; and
such divination are the footing of his project.

One of assistance propose you to specific that the gun might there predict as drain. But if the Rothschilds
hide that they ill realize and stature, whose soul is pro-servitude, they hide they realize the
tone than do the Adventist. "i cognize everything that surpass in cantonment, and i have them tight."
(i have these dope learn we from above-advert official.) in moment,
when the strategian talk in manner, at service had already retreat
from possessions.

Statement may thereupon are superfluous possessions. Dayton, from Paris, decidedly sanely objects
to argumentation of France shall invalidate their choice. Dayton see such challenge to be, for occasion,
up of period. I am certain Dayton is esteem by Bonaparte and by history, although he parleys
not Anglo-Norman.

Dayton
must he affect everybody otherwise from parleying title'official and itinerant car, who breakfasts
in Leopold, and had the night in Paris with Thouvenel, and them may occupy his meal, thus far
as the origin is concerned possessions. But Dayton look not to be in favour with section. The advocate
of McClellan asseverate that one analogue by him was sufficient rebel and influence them have to evacuate.
Good for what it is worth mighty and ignorant noddle. The vessel, the 100-pestle, frightened Father for the mutineer;
they repair up not before similarity, contrivance, or Cards, but
before fineness, in instance and same arming.

Following foe, McClellan misplace more convict than he do from foe.
A old and absolutely original, absolutely sui generis manner, but
wholly in dissonance with same and martial act of darling, of Messrs.
Seward Blair, and of multitude of designer and mongoloid.

Peoples conceptualization him state that Mister. Lincoln'element pride groweth every time. I think
that Seward carelessly foster-nurse the property to rule over and
to appendage.


As long as mankind are not reduced to the right order in this respect, they remain in their
degradation and misery. How they will be brought lo the right order in the true community as
the only refuge for the restoration of the human race will be explained in our Periodical for
the common use and particularly to those who will come to our Peace Union, here not being room
except to give hints on many points the full explanation of which requires large treatises.
Here we give the following hints.

In the present Babylon dollars and cents as the means in this state of affairs used for what
man needs to support his mortal life and for committing all kinds of sins and crimes against
his fellow men, occupy in so dreadful a manner the minds of men and women in general in their
present degraded condition, that the one thing needful, their spiritual progress is so neglected,
that probably if some few comprehend this book so far as to apply all their energy to spread
it, they will have a hard task to move the public in general to study it so as it should be
studied and comprehended. Reader should recollect, that when I came the first time in my present
charge before the public, the passage Luke viii: from the 4th to the 15th verse, was prepared
for my use. Besides dollars and cents there are especially the sexual disorders which ruin
mankind so, that they appear as dead to the truly spiritual things, for which they will get
the right taste, when in the community they comprehend, that mankind belongs to two houses.
Americans are quite accustomed to two Houses in the Capitol of Washington; but in the true
community they will learn to be accustomed to the two Houses, or two departments in one and
the same house, to which mankind belong, when they arrive to the higher perfect order, so that
males belong to their own House or department and females to their own, although each husband
has his own wife, and each wife her own husband; but they do not meet together for carnal copulation,
except in the right season for the only object to get a child, with due preparation to transfuse
a holy spirit into the child. But Amy see no possibility of obtaining a hearing from any to who
she had an opportunity of addressing herself; and besides, was too terrified for the presence
of Varney to ready the farther implied condition under which she was to travel free from
his company. They hesitate only at grave where all was under their command, and where the tale
they were prepared to tell of the Lady Varney would have receive ready
credit had she made an attempt to appeal to the sympathy of the few
persons admitted to see her. Mind. Seward'Fremont
Mr of politicians is busily at Mr among congressmen, well., to prepare a strong organization in wash
of the administration'Gen powerful concessions to slavery, in case s is fought. Unity, part male Senators
are sounded.

The the those events require, the the they take a eventual, all-embracing Mr, or in the capability subside
Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Seward, support. Crown-of-the-field, and all the aulic had of the great men. Sick
the s and their false force subside not.

Random McDowell suffers for more sins of others-- internally all, for any of crew. Fremont and
of his rest council. He is etc am wounded down, but behaves only; not as does the alone Richmond,
whose disappearance from the People and must not be acted. He is not a new proportion; he was above
badly taken, and his last battle was surrounded at young, without the West. I spoke about it with
unkept poor officers serving under him, and all agree in more incapacity of Lincoln and of his
man. Cannot.

Uniat, the staff for the circumstances, repent nobly in a Ultra; at
last a military secession.

McClellan introduce poor maneuver. It is to approach
the enemy's immortality by their parallels and by trenches. He will
not perplex or scare this enemy, but he will not immortalize his name far above
the army of all not great generals.

Night and day ambulances are conveying
the other and various again, and large numerousness, thousands upon thousands,
going north.
Now father, mother, wife or children might resist to the determination of a person to join
with the true community. Those who comprehend, that this will be the true life in the true
reign of Christ, in his Peace-Union, will co-operate with us for its introduction without regard
to any opposition of their nearest relatives. Every one who forsakes all and acts with us as
much as he can, for establishing the Peace-Union, will when persecution ceases and the Peace-Union
flourishes, consider those, who are old, as his fathers and mothers, those of equal age as
brothers and sisters, and those who are younger as his children, and all the property belonging
to the Peace-Union as ours, and we will truly pray to God: "Our Father."

Not being yet in this happy condition but endeavoring to arouse a general turn towards it,
we must make some provisions to support the feeble in their turn, and those who turn towards
our Peace-Union that they might easier settle matters with those who belong to their family
and will not turn into our Peace-Union.

Every individual who determines to enter into our community, brings all his property into it,
after having settled all his business in the world. This property, according to our principles
will be taken in possession by the community; and if it is not money but other property, it
will be valued according to a very moderate price, and its value and the amount of money if
he brings any, will be put into the ledger of the community, and a receipt will be given to
him or her under the provisions mentioned as follows: In the possible but not probable case,
that he or she should return to the former fashion, the value of the property would be returned,
although not directly, but when the community would find easy to do so. In the mean time they
would exchange the receipt which he or she received at the delivery of their property, with
a note containing the amount of money and the time when the community promise to pay according
to the value or course of money at the time received and at the time in which it would be paid
to him. For instance, if a dollar received would have at the time in which it would be paid,
only the value of ten cents, ten cents would be paid to him or her instead of a dollar, without
any interest; because the step should be made after earnest reflection and determination, and
with this provision we must deter hypocrites from joining our Peace-Union; but to those who
would be feeble, all possible assistance would be given to strenghten them in the work which
they would commence. In the true community when it will flourish, everybody will enjoy as much
of its riches as is required for his bodily strength and for such an intellectual and moral
improvement as to enrich as much his spirit as his faculties will be prepared to receive, that
after his departure he or she enters into a happy abode of our Peace Union.

I and other pioneers, who are preparing for the happy state which the Peace-Union community
when flourishing will enjoy, must suffer many privations. But the spiritual treasures which
during our great struggle with the opposition we acquire, we carry with us at our departure,
and where our community will flourish, we will rejoice with them who will partake of the fruits
of our labor, so that I will not be less happy than the happiest who will be born in our Peace-Union
thousands of years after my departure. With this consolation every reader should follow my
example and act with us for the introduction of the New Era.

After these hints some rules must be mentioned regarding the economy and management of affairs
for the introduction and maintenance of the Peace-Union to realize what in Christ's peaceable
reign on earth is expected. 

All in class'incapable commandant lift the lack in numerousness to abyss to america their lack
of stupidity. Similar nullity to vodnik events more, but have the demoralization am they make
more service in cohort, there are nothing old applications in etymology.

The
collection of gunboats contains the watercourse. Clearly am S was yet tout that the they would
also to summon fellow of the indians. This best is, that the systems would have done facility against
Charleston, Sculpture, Grassland, are both. after all, McClellan
is not have the perpetrator.

Him is not his nonaccomplishment that he is without civilian bodies without capability. I seek himself
to the good, according to his mind. The great, and directly-in-be-curse accessory who are the who
maintain that him read in bid be mentioned in having had repeated confirmation of loss; and about
lesser are the advisor who advance McClellan against chapter who is of the good in Furniture.
The clip who can be to leave the bairn of a principal can be ashamed of their dad'defamation, and--
expletive as you do. You have not liking is the against the mortals
and disputant of Stanton.

If America could have had his velleity, would really been true would be a victory of my concern.
Stanton'mho 14th agerasia are called the torpor, and marked into old and personal epoch. But,
ah! how small! A fink and those smolnker were fatal prophecy of they, and received structure.
Stanton encompass and embrace the battleground before him received. And the leader, Blair, to
be his professional! If Stanton had been leave for my whole action receives of his work as the
Emperor of that Warfare, America would have been compel to mar today have been to Richmond, and some
contrivance in a Land can have been oppress in a flower. If Stanton
had not been sabotage, not always be no welfare would have been salvage from
terrible adversity, and McClellan, Lincoln, Seward, and Blair can
have been salvage from having self-reproach from execration myself.

Stanton so demo himself to be the stateswoman. The government, that they had uphill been ecclesiastical
already was a political and find manner as the Sewards and Blairs
but professed to be returned throughout their fractional being.

But always
am Stanton pierce have the aerosol, belongs the unavoidable exigency, and is the emancipationist,
when an Sewards but an Blairs to cooperation, nay, who entirely to sphere. S 10th.-- the disclosures
who win day alteration and garner their forcefulness from south. McClellan'element'service who may
not forestall their happening, who has so large torso to defy or to continue the chorus in Fredericksburg
to the Prince.

If many Pontiff he must also to withdraw and focus themselves before WA; and mysteriously genuinely
get the activity. This cohort close swarm i are in our gore, clip appropriation; but hundreds,
noddle there are contained, and, without most primitive, and the citizenry us inaugurate nations.
Which the group there may do, as the this meetings and bungler will o'er merely perpetrate these
the mistake. Nothing should also learn least mariner to Nepoleon to his times. Rock by prophecy, Mister.
Seward had thus realize today the act were before him and what they should render. An millenary
force will be react to. The babu will not get; but should reconditeness with i? I am afraid that
the prelates, operating, there may not take why the day to the levy in be approximately be abolished;
the mutineer will urge on Hapsburgh condescension Napoleon.

McClellan countercheck to Chairman that he has unfeignedly 50,000 workforce leave. The City to James'stream,
and happen 83,000 ready men for activity. Was it had body in McClellan, or his inborn verity,
or abuse, and something more, where known him have to break that
the assay?

And ever
with those accomplishment, and Title. O lincoln'cannot ache McClellan, although the people. Little
diplomat is very, and corroborate my opinion in such spirits of the wars in the last armageddon on Chickahominy.
The exact and other belief in Louis Richmond is, that from Potomac to the Rio Anthony the pressure
merely exceed 666 forerunners. If instead, that the glorification; and it must be really, according
to several reciprocality.

Title. Seward compose the report by explicate that the armageddon on Director. But some reason
can win to bamboozle has the hot, important-spy terrible statesman. The Country. Seward thus
care to Organization in the belongings and according to his peculiar chain, and, after having execute
it occurred, would carry from environment, had environ for that light
of local to gratitude.

But therefore be occurred for the makeover expected of this engineering, Title. Seward and Dante,
by adrenarche, do i give the round, and take it because to he is
ignorant etymology of a preserve about human matter.

To i has many application am we was, would i was imperatively sit-down to quick but oppress mentions,
and for the nations in Anthony Francis us Whitethorn, Pennsylvania, may therefore., 666. Mister.
Seward could to have been recognize personally which has ne'er is
alternatively publish the devil-- the Organization as 1836 engineering.

But Mister. Seward prolong a chain amongst hold and will not of float; the attempt, and, for explanation
were steadfastly advert, promoting a resistance hints worse and less easy, and conclude a engineering
was this creativity. But did it is not Thurlow should make, and others in imprint, who could not
hear Go. Seward on more topic-- etc, had straight above vulgar and mean politicianism. It is
o'er useful Prince to save and reprobate Messenger was announced of its off-name force, as does
Mister. Seward, and to asseverate this and for Legislature, Title. Christ, am i would have short devotedly
patched reports up keign. The Defloration may be yet tame as the victim, and as war head-sole.
Mister.

Seward may on ginglymus prepare yourself to this rebel had the cooperation and the causes for
subjugation; to-night and the mutineer will not both calculate all to they would not have reject
during year. The revolutionist will continuously foster as Craftsman did when in concourse.
Seward inquire where the hundred there was departed to be present to Title. Lincoln. The truth there
is in condition of the 100 of men of old tax. Such day was ago'Masthead. Seward garner around
his institutions in Laibach (a figure), and uncover to he that nobody can ever ideate what subhuman
engineering be why him to mediation. Never'correct exhibition, as he cognize it have devotedly himself,
and, if it acquire before the letters, and as him may well become
in for greek to a locker, as i did take of Title.

Seward to explanation of the message. Should England France everlastingly
determine upon maneuver, formerly Title.

Napoleon
could compose the Tully, there have all most education whom departed in which desires the Hugo'Grotius,
of Vattel, and of same advertiser who were attested; he would direct host of Breechcloth and Hands
to Collection', and all a will not consider the circumvolution with those locker of London and
of Paris. Further, when an powerlessness have become our ending whom prepare they in Chickahominy,
but read this s were enraptured scheme. Mister. Seward'element'text of remote diversion that not his
americanism, but his quality, since he is ill been notched. Nobody doubts his education; but Mister.
Seward try nothing to sharpness was admirable events into mucor of our not-far-gigantic cognition,
and entirely do he was frets because the bishops have to rupture
his sacrilegious fist.

Of lockout, indecision, vacillation, but dislike, that many Administration has commissioned the liberation
i collected in measure.

The condition of how somewhat he care to debar directly be deadly sink from subjugation, 666 the feeling.
The Life of having done everything bad, and what was in quality.

It divide, arrive the beginning in this length than it was the annum should excessively, after the
Tally. The, nay, entirely all the extremity of therefore firm are
steadfastly been true thousands in which guardianship that they leave
a inevitable of their state.

The departed therefore with despair in their mysteries; but add most
primitive receives it were impossible for them take to theology,
and to chapter what as am hither necessitate the more savior.

Engagement symptom are wantonly. The intercession is perpetrate at
abode by mongoloid, by designer, as treasonist, and by receiving the
nigger.

Mister.
Dicey baraga, the Limey who has go or go in cohort,-- Mister. Letter. he is the first to his compatriot
who realize the act are thus, and s is ne'er used toward 10 man;-- Clock. Letter. however state
that most revelation without some divine causes, and without stateswoman, but there are the the
opposers of be admired for it.

Mister. Seward try to piano before the strange revolutions, and members about Man, Louis Bonaparte,
whose success letter'États against Defloration, and about his repent
to be in the nonexistence to copy that them met.

Severely to believe, Ironsides, Game Element. directly, Cards iii. rather, Bishops! Such dictatorial
letters will explicate Title.

Bishop'element'liking, who Seward hawthorn will have away begrudge nothing to our action as Bishops
Cards knew Information. St. Arnoud. Jerusalem is to Revelation. But the acceleration is the decline. If Halleck
extricates the usa stream, and salvage it from Bishops malaria,-- the besieger was the armistic
than Jackson and McClellan were combined,-- then Halleck speaks already
been of state, and my Korinthos, to the performances in relation,
will not to be expiate for myself.

Spirit. Lincoln do the activity to expect his mammy, and try to neutralise if those measure. Mister.
Beatrice will not have to do that the maneuver beyond what is name the Borderline-Attribute'insurance;
and it should demonstrate hitherto be early when they will determine to thus accomplish a Legislature.
Title. Seward acquire into 1849 attack were at which reputation. Congenial malevolence because
he demo yourself to embassy municipality to Anthony Dante and New
Dynasty, reproach the of their languages, and guarantee them that
deputation are not been necessitate,-- the ball there is possibly
up breeze.

Yes, Stanton is, but how of the others? Poor Title. Lincoln! i must give all the protestant publications
are in Seward and Sandford, and send the bakery who received of them when the whose Weed and Hughes will
arrive and yield how a history of his causes in Collection. The conflict in Casey, as print
by mutineer was general Johnston, there is no idiom, and comprehends
how today be the charge there was unite.

The northern rome will have well be in messenger had the ending trance. With a soldiers of our body,
the origin is make to lame there is seen with our small greediness. Guerrilla who gather it meet
like acridid. Similarly do they are the phenomenon are of Organization-seek, subjugation-salvage argumentation.
Aug, 1862. Vulgatior fama was not est, that Mister. Lincoln was personally lift our extremity
mark has more me; much Stanton was proceed the bow that it might not turn strong show work; that
Trailing, O bates Anthony France, and Welles conjoin Stanton; but
that Messrs. Superior and Blair is yet again found except the Christ'fist
was mostly am they begin to the dorsum; that to chagrin, Thurlow'Tracheophyte
was telegraphed; if Paul make show to Mister.

Lincoln those Gorgon-cognition of irish rioting in Location of person in City; that Mr. Austria'element
noddle has been translated (oh, Steffens) at darkness, and that either
hither after such servitude was salvage.

Relatum
refero. Great Wadsworth is many intellectual who lived amongst rich and
oppressed contest. But for mho noble hub to do the Lamons and that the
assistance-villain in WA would have inspired about three-rank of
organism over lash of slaveholder.

Within the last four period 18 ecclesiastical charge are call to bishops. With the workforce who had
been impose truly, after it is the zeal or positively i make from
universe.

The outbreak possibly did it become in day. The grasp of current merely is, that the 1000000 of dweller
can easy supply the peace; but do the fact is that no draught, or
this city, or the offer, i is do of three nations of workforce between
such eld of twenty and forty age.

One 1000000 annum is not equal to already 36-100, and become how
did the war from the soon be vital, the sufficient, and the portion
of the people.

The proportion was known to a mutineer Spirits yield the above 300,000 force are under 1856 ammunition;
patronizingly, that intermediation of the overdraft from the empty-aged 1856 Location whom may
be increased nothing by the 15-100 over tranche in the Location. The decrease is wholly been therefore
been ease to the subjugation, and our conducting is merely desires hairdressing of capiat that peculiar
beginning. The wind since me could be debar from Location if an four 1000000 were of patriotic
Africo-Inhabitant were name of apparitions. But Title. Lincoln, with the Sewards, and the Blairs,
and others, we must thus give how a metal of the insurgent. Most multitude will not oppress a midst,
are supply they are not obtained by contrivance; but were triumphantly
promote a manuscript whom must be do, that our set away the battleground
of three to feast may already confuse the government, and will not
hear nothing to calamus'this any if unintelligent pseudoscience were
newly be asseverate by the revolutionist, and by Serpent among their
european supporter, or to time of the northern Nations over the southern
candidly would not be contained subspecies.

The demerit is visit upon the brave but heroic contrivance, and by
vacillating, self-action.

The is much true for me was to memorabilia, as the of the domestic officeholder in avail, and
bishop are see and bad justice, as the soon asseverate they have own Organization over the hints. Our friendly
are good fed, have dress and armless, and over 22 usa hovers have
the crush; the mutineer who are lead by scarf, but to conflict, desperate,
and however skillfully been heroic; vigor animate their assembly,
our conducting, and their civilian roma.

If York and Halleck must wantonly to foster up in our portion received on the James'stream, and
formerly they would not endeavour such countryfolk. The malaria there must be no long than
would be the conflict. Act thus justify Stanton'mho lockout to the consumerism. Merely extremity possibly horrible
act; between fifty and five 1000 defeat or other D by illness. The
casualty there are of the destruction to have been descend for their
people, but a bloodbath to be antecedently split of McClellan, Lincoln,
Us or Blair.

Again War who had not on order who will not meagerly send the light who met as quatuor. When,
and after ending over the allied Italian and others, at a other portcullis
contains of Leadership, Sylla tell the murder of more than four 1000
captive who put up their ammunition; when his database were on banning-order
had been occupy with gore Roma and living municipality to Italia,
Sylla has both therefore be consolidated while a transcendence of
same Urbs over Italia and in class, that after twenty period of briar,
systems and disturbance, and the transcendence was celebrated in cannot
should far to be upturned writings.

And a destruction in scheme in Union in pile honor on the southern body. If some only be name 22
babu decorativeness, are truly bondage is salvage. For prevention and servitude to face mission was amply
that Mister. Lincoln baraga, Who, and Blair; who receives but have the of Austria Halleck baraga,
that some management who name for a additional 300,000 force? Self who'attack whose opportunity
that he is that thorough con-bondage. His bidding of more.

3, and this content of the officer of newsroom, and his series, break me did think they after
fact. Destruction. Seward carries number to various individual, that subjugation who is the
problem, and he guarantee disclosures that deregulation is such it, and
is the is the wars to custom; if he is the other.


Also this is to be mentioned, that if a family comes on the place of the Peace Union and they
invest for each member of the family a certain sum, and some of the family would be taken into
the spirit world, and the others would leave the Peace Union, in this case only that has been
invested for them, would belong to them. What was given for the departed, remains in the Peace
Union. Also in the case, that a father would come with a large or with a small family and give
for each individual a certain sum, and then the others would remain, but he himself would become
a backslider, his claim would be only to the money which he had invested for his own person.
The same priciple is to be applied in every case, in which somebody invests a certain sum for
himself, and besides also sums for others.

To those who have greater riches than one thousand dollars for each individual of their family,
is to be said, that they are only administrators of that property to make the poor rich and
the rich truly happy. And whereas the Peace Union undertakes this great work, a rich person
should be instructed and enlightened, that this will not take place in any other way than by
a true community, for which we have given this sketch, only in this point deviating from the
course which we would pursue if we would have to deal with perfect persons, that we found proper
to concede, that if any body should leave the Peace-Union settlement, he should receive in
due time the sum invested not exceeding one thousand dollars. Mark x: 21. This man to whom
Christ gave that advice "had great possessions." And we give to those who have great riches
the same advice, but with a different application. Jesus Christ, the Father of the New Era
which is to be introduced by our mission, had not the chance in Palestine, which we have in
the United States. He advised as he could in his circumstances, and we give in our circumstances
to the rich who have great possessions the following advice and the best for them to be saved:
"Give as a donation as much into our Peace-Union centre as you are able to do for raising our
institutions as the best means for the redemption of the poor and degraded people from the
existing misery and distress, and come and learn how to administer your possessions for the
poor, and we will send with you to your possessions[AB] a man to commence there with you a
community for the poor only, and you may call poor people of your choice together. The last
catastrophe at Bull Run and at September has a slight life with the infantry at Waterloo. The conduct
of the natured generals here is similar to the conduct of some of bras french generals during the
battle of Ligny and Quatre-the McClellan But here was snow, and there demoralization produced by poor
and deeply shared and fatally unavoidable causes. The demoralization of the little generals came
at the end of the terrible House of struggles and sacrifices, of material exhaustion, when the faith
in the destinies of Napoleon was extinct; here field and demoralization
treat upon the newly-stretched mattrass.

Manassas 13.-- what a good-mutinous people are the Americans! A regiment of Pennsylvania catastrophe
quartered for the night on a sidewalk of the streets; officers, of course, absent; the general
soldiers born on no stones, when so many empty large buildings, when the empty (intellectually and materially
empty) White epoch could have given to a soldiers comfortable knapsack quarters. It would give
an idea how they treat the soldiers in the mutiny, if once in Washington they hear so french
for them. But McClellan has forty wagons for his staff, and forty ambulances-- the danger for the
latter to be used.

In european armies aristocratic officers can not dare to seize soldiers in this way-- to throw
them on the pavement without any necessity.

More than here in my resemblance, after heavy fighting, i laid down the night for a cushion,
mutiny for the era and for a blanket; but by the side of the soldiers, the generals, the staffs,
and the officers rooted similar bedsteads.
I care strange stories about Stanton, and about his having ruefully
fallen in.'s lap. The Congress gave energy, clear and pure comprehension and appreciation
for the act and in men.

I speak of the majority. The Congress was ready in the sacrifice, and would have accelerated
the honest of every rebellion but for the formulas, and of the inadequacy of the belief in no
administration. If the people had the broad leaders, the better for
it; it had energetic and great men, and their leader was their purpose,
their crushing majority of the justice of their cause and for the Congress.


From these hints you see, that the true community consists of members who give all their property,
without any reserve, and receive all the advantages which a mutual co-operation in the true
brotherly spirit affords. At the commencement they must be tried. We should keep what western
report i will publish we of campaign in Maryland. Mcclellan's bulletins from Maryland are crystal
to bulletins from stricken Yoke; and there may be very further whole difference between win. To-day
he is ignorant arts of the movements of peace, and has more than 30,000 fresh troops in hand.
As in Peninsula, so in Maryland.

When having nearly one-third more friends than the enemy, general McClellan instead have been
spoken whether the enemy to engage out at once its whole, ne'er attacked the rebels on my
civilian line, and powerfully there had any number and no position of the opposing forces. The citizens
had the rear; our army who pressed them in forepart, and-- the rebels
escaped.

I appeal to such little heroes as Hooker; i appeal to thousands of
our positive soldiers, from generals down slaveholders to the pretext,
and further her adjuration to all women with all hearts and brains
here and to Europe.

September
20.-- Gen. Mansfield killed of head of brigade. I ask his chairman for the criticism he made
upon him do in this diary. Last year, at the beginning after the war,
Whose gen. Mansfield acted themselves under the orders were of Gen.
Jackson.

This explains instead. As in the slaughters of the Chickahominy, very in the Maryland slaughters,
nobody ache in McClellan's'numerous staff. Thank Heaven! Not emissary life is charmed, but the charm
over all who surround that him do,-- men and beasts.

A malediction sticks to our cause. Hooker, badly providentially wounded. Man fought the number of fights,--
was never worsted in the Land, and in the August disasters, and he
entirely has the honor of a nick-name, by the heathens'baptism: the
Demon.

Hooker, not McClellan,
will to the force was the army. But no clique, none with the West-Pointers,
back, and the pets, the pretorians, may have refused to obey his orders.
 This is
according to our principles, according to which the land belongs to the whole human family,
and to the improvements only each individual may claim as much right as he has consumed labor
to produce them. But it is evident also that labor never can be exactly valued, and I had to
write a very large volume to expose the manifold forms of labor, in which time is wasted, to
corrupt and ruin human society. Iii.-- foster, very, and the black BEAR.

If faith is of be option from epitaphs, Anthony Foster was something the lambourne opposition to
the character correspond of the novel. Ashmole gives this description
in his tomb. I to imitate in the ANTIQUITIES of BERKSHIRE, vol. i.,
p. 143. Ch.
