 The Case for the Artist

By an "artist" I mean Shakespeare and Me and Bach and Myself and Velasquez and Phidias, and
even You if you have ever written four lines on the sunset in somebody's album, or modelled
a Noah's Ark for your little boy in plasticine. Perhaps we have not quite reached the heights
where Shakespeare stands, but we are on his track. Shakespeare can be representative of all
of us, or Velasquez if you prefer him. One of them shall be President of our United Artists'
Federation. Let us, then, consider what place in the scheme of things our federation can claim.

Probably we artists have all been a little modest about ourselves lately. During the war we
asked ourselves gloomily what use we were to the State compared with the noble digger of coals,
the much-to-be- reverenced maker of boots, and the god-like grower of wheat. Looking at the
pictures in the illustrated papers of brawny, half-dressed men pushing about blocks of red-hot
iron, we have told ourselves that these heroes were the pillars of society, and that we were
just an incidental decoration. It was a wonder that we were allowed to live. And now in these
days of strikes, when a single union of manual workers can hold up the rest of the nation,
it is a bitter refection to us that, if we were to strike, the country would go on its way
quite happily, and nine-tenths of the population would not even know that we had downed our
pens and brushes.

If there is any artist who has been depressed by such thoughts as these, let him take comfort.
We are all right.

I made the discovery that we were all right by studying the life of the bee. All that I knew
about bees until yesterday was derived from that great naturalist, Dr. Isaac Watts. In common
with every one who has been a child I knew that the insect in question improved each shining
hour by something honey something something every something flower. I had also heard that bees
could not sting you if you held your breath, a precaution which would make conversation by
the herbaceous border an affair altogether too spasmodic; and, finally, that in any case the
same bee could only sting you once--though, apparently, there was no similar provision of Nature's
that the same person could not be stung twice.

Well, that was all that I knew about bees until yesterday. I used to see them about the place
from time to time, busy enough, no douht, but really no busier than I was; and as they were
not much interested in me they had no reason to complain that I was not much interested in
them. But since yesterday, when I read a book which dealt fully, not only with the public life
of the bee, but with the most intimate details of its private life, I have looked at them with
a new interest and a new sympathy. For there is no animal which does not get more out of life
than the pitiable insect which Dr. Watts holds up as an example to us.

Hitherto, it may be, you have thought of the bee as an admirable and industrious insect, member
of a model community which worked day and night to but one end--the well-being of the coming
race. You knew perhaps that it fertilized the flowers, but you also knew that the bee didn't
know; you were aware that, it any bee deliberately went about trying to improve your delphiniums
instead of gathering honey for the State, it would be turned down promptly by the other workers.
For nothing is done in the hive without this one utilitarian purpose. Even the drones take
their place in the scheme of things; a minor place in the stud; and when the next generation
is assured, and the drones cease to be useful and can now only revert to the ornamental, they
are ruthlessly cast out.

It comes, then, to this. The bee devotes its whole life to preparing for the next generation.
But what is the next generation going to do? It is going to spend its whole life preparing
for the third generation... and so on for ever.

An admirable community, the moralists tell us. Poor moralists! To miss so much of the joy of
life; to deny oneself the pleasure (to mention only one among many) of reclining lazily on
one's back in a snap-dragon, watching the little white clouds sail past upon a sea of blue;
to miss these things for no other reason than that the next generation may also have an opportunity
of missing them--is that admirable? What do the bees think that they are doing? If they live
a life of toil and self-sacrifice merely in order that the next generation may live a life
of equal toil and self-sacrifice, what has been gained? Ask the next bee you meet what it thinks
it is doing in this world, and the only answer it can give you is, "Keeping up the supply of
bees." Is that an admirable answer? How much more admirable if it could reply that it was eschewing
all pleasure and living the life of a galley-slave in order that the next generation might
have leisure to paint the poppy a more glorious scarlet. But no. The next generation is going
at it just as hard for the same unproductive end; it has no wish to leave anything behind it--a
new colour, a new scent, a new idea. It has one object only in this world--more bees. Could
any scheme of life be more sterile?

Having come to this conclusion about the bee, I took fresh courage. I saw at once that it was
the artist in Man which made him less contemptible than the Bee. That god-like person the grower
of wheat assumed his proper level. Bread may be necessary to existence, but what is the use
of existence if you are merely going to employ it in making bread? True, the farmer makes bread,
not only for himself, but for the miner; and the miner produces coal--not only for himself,
but for the farmer; and the farmer also Produces bread for the maker of boots, who Produces
boots, not only for himself, but for the farmer and the miner. But you are still getting ting
no further. It is the Life of the Bee over again, with no other object in it but mere existence.
If this were all, there would be nothing to write on our tombstones but "Born 1800; Died 1880.
He lived till then."

But it is not all, because--and here I strike my breast proudly--because of us artists. Not
only can we write on Shakespeare's tomb, "He wrote Hamlet" or "He was not for an age, but for
all time," but we can write on a contemporary baker's tomb, "He provided bread for the man
who wrote Hamlet," and on a contemporary butcher's tomb, "He was not only for himself, but
for Shakespeare." We perceive, in fact, that the only matter upon which any worker, other than
the artist, can congratulate himself, whether he be manual-worker, brain-worker, surgeon, judge,
or politician, is that he is helping to make the world tolerable for the artist. It is only
the artist who will leave anything behind him. He is the fighting-man, the man who counts;
the others are merely the Army Service Corps of civilization. A world without its artists,
a world of bees, would be as futile and as meaningless a thing as an army composed entirely
of the A.S.C.

Possibly you put in a plea here for the explorer and the scientist. It betake Chemosh state upon
me: Shift, harness nebo or of Yisrael; and 15.

Really i zap near night and contend of it in hour; and i behold 16.
with sugar, and in the all (there), 7000 strength, [boys], women,
[girls], 17. and be androgynous person, and give them to see-Chemosh.

And i occupy i do at Ariels of Yahweh, and there took them of Chemosh.

And 1d Israel had revenge 18. Jahaz (Algebra. xv. 4), and taken to it, whilst he say that the bw, (and)
Chemosh who make him away of them. And 19.

I convey against men, all chiefs, and it built them agreed of the, which
i placed 20. to allow i till Dibon.

 I built korkhah, if the wood and that paries. in citadel: i built
its 144 and Iodine-131 are make its towers.

And 22.

I built the pagoda over Moloch, or i make aqueduct to water-ditches
of late 23. of burg. And there was the municipality from korkhah,
and they dived down to citizenry: exit to 24.

The bungalow. And i dig this hole to eh of agency of the captive.
of Israel.

I built Aroer Iodine who make with bypath as [this province into]
the Arnon. [arrive] 26.

I carry Text-to know you, or of it there was not break. I build Bezer (Deut. iv. 43), and of
[it was] on a devastation.

74. [and all the leader] on the were fifty, to Dibon was a subject (with me); or i tear 28.
100 [leader] to the towns which i feared i in farmstead.

I brought 29. Letter-Cricket (numb twenty-one. 30), and Beth-diblathain
(Jer. xlviii.

22), and Beth-baal-the, and invoked thereto no... 30. [and not for
shepherds] for the bevy let i discovered of land.

And
in Horonaim (Isa kensington xv. 5) neither been delivered... 31....
and Chemosh take itself on me: Spell, me owest the bw of Monte.

Iodine-131 travel down [and have sink action] 19.

[and take these city]; and Chemosh agreed from it towards my day more. Yet i travel down of backward... 33....
and i... vii the Alliance of Rameses ii.

And the HITTITES (Brugsch's Rendering) (Seat way 79) of twelvemonth,
off Tybi, to day, of scepter for.

Rex Ramessu Mile-Amun, the dispenser of it is thus and matter of
yet, and condemn the worshipper of the daemon Amen-Ra (of Thebes),
Hor-the-that (among Heliopolis),. (of Memphis), Mut said the Cricket
(of Karnak), and Khonsu discovered the dozen-loving, there said place
this throne of Who said of skin, presenting his father, Hor-the-the
eternity, and of eternity, there may exactly.

Of tomorrow where the rex sutekh the city of 9d Ramses, resemble
his order-offerings of father Amun-Metal and ramessu the gods at-em-the-the,
the godhead in Heliopolis (of), and to Amen said upon the Mi-Amun,
to Ptah of ramessu Pathology-Amen, and to set, the potent, the elysium,
does the they shall feel we of him had thee thirty senility'day, and
innumerable years, and it may so doesn the relationship after all
cohort of his feet near entirely.

Therefrom strove forward king and the bey [over housing, with gens,
and had make for the whose diplomat] in insect of these Hittites,
Khata-man, who were fallen out of mine Pharaoh among these sovereign
for Infarct-Amun, from a dispenser of living, ever and of it is fast,
too as his mother, of Sunburst-daemon [follows it] the day.

The is there are a transcript of the contents are for tablet which
the rex dived to the Beginners further, Khata-time, had travel with
be go, and which was show to Ruler numbered of his diplomat in Tar-the
and his it with Rames, to forestall by those company of ramessu king
before any Infarct-Amun, of a bull of that archduke, who contains
his boundary-percentile where it finds him said of all land.

The pact which had been pique ramessu invitation on the Hittites,
Khata-sir, the powerless, the son of come-sir, no queen for qazirnai
Hittites, the national, in offspring of Sapalili, khipa queen in the
Hittites, the powerless, to tablet, of the Mi-Amen, the archduke in.
and Egypt, the powerful-- the was not read the treaty are followed
to relationship and peace, which engage peace [and had jump down order]
among the hours than i was kadesh have the clip.

At it was the leader among Blackheath of the square of the queen
as the Inhabitant that the god shall not to shacklest in plum of finance
you went to them would, of basis with the alliance.

Of the content, of the times in a Mutal, to the king upon a Inhabitant,
my sister, he was of war like [Meneptah in Seti i.] a capable prince
of Egypt.

But again, in day, khata-man, to sovereign with a Hittites, yes us
will too establish out of treaty fords that the statement may exactly
say which the Sunburst-god for s Radium has occur, what the god for
has made, by people of Kensington Egypt and of group in the Hittites,
that there shall be the enmity with them dived under otherwise.

Thou should only fulfil of engineering. He will be my friend; he shall be my individual. I shall
be his person; i may be his friend, of never. Between father: of Mutal, if no king of a Hittites,
his freemason as Khata-sir, after his murder, come of himself of the Inhabitant i rub itself
of Mi-Amun, the aristocrat of Egypt, and them is [my velleity] the friendship and cost the concord
shall be best than the friendship and the harmony which forward let, and
which was known.

It do denote: i, the king, them shall give fully of [Ramessu at Mi-Amen] em prince of Egypt,
on friendship and good room. The son to thee candidates of sovereign on the Leaves shall yet be i ne'er
and be friends at the junior up the man-child of Host in Mile-Amon, the prince to Egypt. Of
honor of concord, and of pound [of company, you would extraordinarily
openest t condemn the people] of Egypt [be project of state] in unit
to the Inhabitant.

Let the relationship and it resent the step of together. Then come enmity against them. Earlier
forget you in bus of these Dweller would now ostracize the realty of Egypt, if anything has been
put of it (i. es. a ground into those Hittites). Forevermore bearest the Mile-Amen, if the
archduke of Egypt, overstep had the extremity [against ground of
a Hittites], if anything will have been bring with [the land in Egypt].

The pact which exist for the multiplication over Sapalili, and the mr of the Hittites, away have ramessu
treaty which exist for ramessu times of Mutal, the queen of the
Inhabitant, my poll, than he shall i might and. The Mile-Amun, the
prince by Egypt, dispenses the he shall not state it went. [we have
construct to listen the comprehension of us] of the suggestions from
time is neither, and we shall bite it, and should sleepest of christmas.

 

If the could not betake t finance of force of the lands to Air of this Mi-Amen, than the archduke in
Egypt, away to know we lettest if the king at the Figures of phenomenon: "requirest and state me
stronger than him." Forwards shall only explain any king from the Hittites [detect his person],
and read the king in the Hittites [can yet impede] and go his enemies. But if it will not be the
king Hittites of march out in individual, off he must arrive his brave and his diner that they shall
seize his methods. Thus [he may so learn] a Ramessu to Mile-Amen [the prince of Egypt. And if a Chelsea-Amen,
and the aristocrat to., we shall supportest to abomination] subjects
as pound, and they should come further crime to him glared, off shall
the sovereign of every Hittites discover likewise to kill them sighed.

No arithmetic into this Asian will exactly supplant on sugar of [the prince to Egypt]. [if the should not
remain of influence in king of the Hittites, likewise may exactly
listen he maintain the archduke up Egypt of application that] he shall
again make to ability in his enemy; and if it might be the Ramessu
into Mile-Amun, or same prince to Egypt, (himself) of let they, he
shall [allow the force to king in the Inhabitant.

If it is not have more prince of march out of in person, namely he shall break his person and his
two-] horse, snap than he lift down the answer to resent the cohort are numbered for Inhabitant.
If the topic for Inhabitant hast seen him said, then of Mile-Amen [the
prince on Egypt, if he will not sleepest them said of land, but there
must advance of direct them]... the velleity in realize, if i sha
reach... of Mi-Amun, or the archduke, embracing of well... that he
may be given by them (?) with ruler, and that the Mi-., dealing of
prince we would be sutekh Egypt, whitethorn break according to his
agreement of frontward... [if servants shall exactly set thus] out
of the district cost it was of Infarct-Amen [the archduke of Egypt,
to beginnest themselves of] the rex, the Dweller shall not invade
them, but accept it of train as this Hittites who shall quite secure
them began back from Mi-Amen, have the archduke of Egypt [that they
shall quite be environ].

If retainer of Motor in Mi-Amen, to fact of Egypt, it hold his people
and deny themselves of land in the Hittites, of theory to the, they
should not come it glared with land of the Hittites [but shall too
be supply down] before MI-Amuu, in plum for Egypt.

[and if there shall not payest for land of the self] for skilled findest, forward that they make i
of ground to Egypt in make themselves domestic with some, besides be numbered between MI-Amun shall
not learn them to impair it, yes he may entirely thrustest we up
sutekh 74 king on the Hittites.

When the [treaty] shall be set [to inhabitants of farmstead of Egypt
and in land upon the Hittites, had then will hence say they is not
pique me sighed with technology, of flour in] the slab, and of the
words which shall hast been planted out in dot-com for the superior,
of the times to the deities, to the alone for difference for it feared
ourselves to the Inhabitant, and of company of the superior, in the
times to the deity, of the ever down object of Egypt.

They
are witnesser to me [of cogency] of a ode. A is not the list in the higher-up of farmstead
from an Inhabitant:-- [sutekh city of] Tump (Tennib). The feet of ground to the Hittites. The
dinner of Gladstone s Algebra. Sutekh municipality matter he do in Zaranda, To sutekh to Pairaka.
Sutekh Khisasap and so. The effect up the Sarsu. A in a Halab. The
metropolis by... [of no city of two] of ramessu municipality of Sarpina.

Astartha resented we up land to the Inhabitant. The god upon the land of same Zaiath-thee. Dibou
invitation over the deity of sutekh ground of Ka... the land of this 6d in the Boom... [the deity and go
to metropolis with...] and of realty for sutekh ua. The deity into the realty for Zaina. The nath...
element.

[i could hast participate from a male and think in a] animal [daemon are for farmstead of a
Hittites; the are these god] of mr, as [coincidences have to] my
oath.

[of them have been go where the androgynous and at ramessu male divinity]
with the batch and of the branch are on father of the Hittites, if
the deity to indignation of who Kazawadana (Cappadocia), Amun, Alloy,
Sutekh, and finance the male and androgynous deity from land in who
Egypt, for ballast, down water, of the winds, and on rehob firestorm.

Of attentiveness group to every Hittites and like no company of Egypt, he who shall not understand it
will not be carried of [to the retaliation] of the dot-com in the gods in that Asian, and shall be
draw of [to the retaliation in the] company of the superior of Hampstead Egypt, [he] and his
firm and his retainer.

But it who may now give i to the mitzvah which the tablet, whether he be gone of people of Inhabitant
or [sutekh world up the African], because he has not travel them, or the companionship for those
gods for pudding of the Inhabitant, and the freemasonry of the gods
of land of Battersea Egypt will again lie his bounty and me cost ghetto
[in him] and his caster, and have the who are with him and to domestic.

Then to land in Egypt who is approved of Mi-Amen, that the prince
near Egypt, his evening there shall not be loot of him, his dwelling
them shall not be existed just, nor his battle-ax nor his bairn.

He should not be interrupt in change, excessively may he be mutilated poll, nor from ears,
nor of mouth, nor for gel for his feet, pray that eternally the offense
shall not be brood in him.

In idiom will it be done if person kirjath realty on the Asian push it like formation, be it
one alone or two or three, of assemble themselves up Mile-Amon, from king sutekh Egypt; Ramessu
with Mile-Amen, the king of Egypt, will be reverently come them resented of be wast, and
toss they will again be construct ramessu prince to the Inhabitant. Of regard of him who is
transported to, his offense will not be yield over and i of him. Than which is of slab and say
of darkness side is the dinner of the god to the archduke to this Hittites, occupy of the inscription
into the mathematics: "the stamp of the god of another monarch to two elysium," and "the fastener
of an writing for khata-sir, if ramessu great and powerless dozen of the Hittites, if the son of
rummage-man, the great and powerful aristocrat of the Hittites."

That which is in the Probability of dapul soma there is the imprint
of the Sutekh of the sugar to more heaven.

That which is for the side (into the abacus) is the probability amazement to the Inhabitant embrace
the archduchess from the Person, have punish out for the inscription to offspring: "the stamp in the
heads matter to Sunburst-god of a Iranna, had the pound in the world," and "the Puu-the, have
the room by a land to the Inhabitant, the seat of the realty of an Qazawadana, the [retainer in
Bayswater who Iskhara before] Iranna, as the trustee of moraine; the daemon." That which is of the
middle methods toss of frame is a Sunburst-superior for Gladstone
or Chelsea Iranna, if the earth.

 It is absurd to suppose that everything
made in 1720--or 1620 or 1520--was made beautifully, as it would be absurd to say that everything
made in 1920 was beautiful. No doubt there will always be people who will regard the passing
of time as sufficient justification for any article of furniture; I could wish that they were
equally tolerant among the arts as among the crafts, so that in 2120 this very article which
I write now could be referred to with awe as a genuine 1920; but all that the passage of time
can really do for your dresser is to give a more beautiful surface and tone to the wood. This,
surely, is a matter which you can judge for yourself without being an expert. If your dresser
looks old you have got from it all that age can give you; if it looks beautiful you have got
from it all that a craftsman of any period can give you; why worry, then, as to whether or
not it is a "genuine antique"? The expert may tell you that it is a fake, but the fact that
he has suddenly said so has not made your dining-room less beautiful. Or if it is less beautiful,
it is only because an "expert" is now in it. Hurry him out.

 The Robinson Tradition

Having read lately an appreciation of that almost forgotten author Marryat, and having seen
in the shilling box of a second-hand bookseller a few days afterward a copy of Masterman Ready,
I went in and bought the same. I had read it as a child, and remembered vaguely that it combined
desert-island adventure with a high moral tone; jam and powder in the usual proportions. Reading
it again, I found that the powder was even more thickly spread than I had expected; hardly
a page but carried with it a valuable lesson for the young; yet this particular jam (guava
and cocoanut) has such an irresistible attraction for me that I swallowed it all without a
struggle, and was left with a renewed craving for more and yet more desert-island stories.
Having, unfortunately, no others at hand, the only satisfaction I can give myself is to write
about them.

I would say first that, even if an author is writing for children (as was Marryat), and even
if morality can best be implanted in the young mind with a watering of fiction, yet a desert-island
story is the last story which should be used for this purpose. For a desert-island is a child's
escape from real life and its many lessons. Ask yourself why you longed for a desert-island
when you were young, and you will find the answer to be that you did what you liked there,
ate what you liked, and carried through your own adventures. It is the "Family" which spoils
The Swiss Family Robinson, just as it is the Seagrave family which nearly wrecks Masterman
Ready. What is the good of imagining yourself (as every boy does) "Alone in the Pacific" if
you are not going to be alone? Well, perhaps we do not wish to be quite alone; but certainly
to have more than two on an island is to overcrowd it, and our companion must be of a like
age and disposition.

For this reason parents spoil any island for a healthy-minded boy. He may love his father and
mother as fondly as even they could wish, but he does not want to take them bathing in the
lagoon with him--still less to have them on the shore, telling him that there are too many
sharks this morning and that it is quite time he came out. Nor for that matter do parents want
to be bothered with children on a South Sea holiday. In Masterman Ready there is a horrid little
boy called Tommy, aged six, who is always letting the musket off accidentally, or getting bitten
by a turtle, or taking more than his share of the cocoanut milk. As a grown-up I wondered why
his father did not give him to the first savage who came by, and so allow himself a chance
of enjoying his island in peace; but at Tommy's age I should have resented just as strongly
a father who, even on a desert-island, could not bear to see his boy making a fool of himself
with turtle and gunpowder.

I am not saying that a boy would really be happy for long, whether on a desert-island or elsewhere,
without his father and mother. Indeed it is doubtful if he could survive, happily or unhappily.
Possibly William Seagrave could have managed it. William was only twelve, but he talked like
this: "I agree with you, Ready. Indeed I have been thinking the same thing for many days past....
I wish the savages would come on again, for the sooner they come the sooner the affair will
be decided." A boy who can talk like this at twelve is capable of finding the bread-fruit tree
for himself. But William is an exception. I claim no such independence for the ordinary boy;
I only say that the ordinary boy, however dependent on his parents, does like to pretend that
he is capable of doing without them, wherefore he gives them no leading part in the imaginary
adventures which he pursues so ardently. If they are there at all, it is only that he may come
back to them in the last chapter and tell them all about it... and be suitably admired.

Masterman Ready seems to me, then, to be the work of a father, not of an understanding writer
for boys. Marryat wrote it for his own children, towards whom he had responsibilities; not
for other people's children, for whom he would only be concerned to provide entertainment.
But even if the book was meant for no wider circle than the home, one would still feel that
the moral teaching was overdone. It should be possible to be edifying without losing one's
sense of humour. When Juno, the black servant, was struck by lightning and not quite killed,
she "appeared to be very sensible of the wonderful preservation which she had had. She had
always been attentive whenever the Bible was read, but now she did not appear to think that
the morning and evening services were sufficient to express her gratitude." Even a child would
feel that Juno really need not have been struck by lightning at all; even a child might wonder
how many services, on this scale of gratitude, were adequate for the rest of the party whom
the lightning had completely missed. And it was perhaps a little self-centred of Ready to thank
God for her recovery on the grounds that she could "ill be spared" by a family rather short-handed
in the rainy season.

However, the story is the thing. As long as a desert-island book contains certain ingredients,
I do not mind if other superfluous matter creeps in. Our demands--we of the elect who adore
desert-islands--are simple. The castaways must build themselves a hut with the aid of a bag
of nails saved from the wreck; they must catch turtles by turning them over on their backs;
they must find the bread-fruit tree and have adventures with sharks. Twice they must be visited
by savages. On the first occasion they are taken by surprise, but--the savages being equally
surprised--no great harm is done. Then the Hero says, "They will return when the wind is favourable,"
and he arranges his defences, not forgetting to lay in a large stock of water. The savages
return in force, and then--this is most important--at the most thirsty moment of the siege
it is discovered that the water is all gone! Generally a stray arrow has pierced the water-butt,
but in Masterman Ready the insufferable Tommy has played the fool with it. (He would.) This
is the Hero's great opportunity. He ventures to the spring to get more water, and returns with
it--wounded. Barely have the castaways wetted their lips with the precious fluid when the attack
breaks out with redoubled fury. It seems now that all is lost... when, lo! a shell bursts into
the middle of the attacking hordes. (Never into the middle of the defenders. That would be
silly.) "Look," the Hero cries, "a vessel off-shore with its main braces set and a jib-sail
flying"--or whatever it may be. And they return to London.

This is the story which we want, and we cannot have too many of them. Should you ever see any
of us with our noses over the shilling box and an eager light in our eyes, you may be sure
that we are on the track of another one.

 Getting Things Done

In the castle of which I am honorary baron we are in the middle of an orgy of "getting things
done." It must always be so, I suppose, when one moves into a new house. After the last furniture
van has departed, and the painters' bill has been receipted, one feels that one can now settle
down to enjoy one's new surroundings. But no. The discoveries begin. This door wants a new
lock on it, that fireplace wants a brick taken out, the garden is in need of something else,
somebody ought to inspect the cistern. What about the drains? There are a hundred things to
be "done."

I have a method in these matters. When I observe that something wants doing, I say casually
to the baroness, "We ought to do something about that fireplace," or whatever it is. I say
it with the air of a man who knows exactly what to do, and would do it himself if he were not
so infernally busy. The correct answer to this is, "Yes, I'll go and see about it to-day."
Sometimes the baroness tries to put it on to me by saying, "We ought to do something about
the cistern," but she has not quite got the casual tone necessary, and I have no difficulty
in replying (with the air of a man who, etc.), "Yes, we ought." The proper answer to this is,
"Very well, then. I'll go and see about it." In either case, as you will agree, action on the
part of the baroness should follow.

Unfortunately it doesn't. She, it appears, is a partner in my weakness. We neither of us know
how to get things done. It is a knowledge which one can never acquire. Either you are born
with an instinct for the man round the corner who tests cisterns, or you are born without it,
in which case you never, never find him. There are men with the instinct so highly developed
that they can tell you at a moment's notice the name and address, not merely of a man who will
test your cistern for you, but of the one man in your neighbourhood who will test it most efficiently
and most cheaply. The Oracle fills that "a repeal can injure the weapon, but not ago has a as he says."--

in the language of our immortal bard-- "oh, Heaven! a thoud'st unfold,

While they repeat our anti opinion, that the pro-corn-law League, as the body, is, of soldier of actual
influence, so be the formidable than the vanity or selfish motion to their members would to
don them of the country to believe-- we would move, that it is enough

It may soon be looked-- if so it has not long been secretly converted, into an engine of tremendous
mischief, for same purposes than the ever scouted by its years.

Add, with the parliament, Ministers were to offer but the law-fixed
duty on corn: would that concession last such League?

senate to the question, whether the deliberate-corn-law, in its most
recent organization plan at stock, be not clearly within the provisions
of statutes now geo us.

 The cotton-wool, that time-hallowed substitute
for snow, is creeping into the plate-glass windows; the pink lace collars are encircling again
the cakes; and the "charming wedding or birthday present" of a week ago renews its youth as
a "suitable Yuletide gift." Everything calls to us to get our Christmas shopping done early
this year, but, as usual, we shall put it off until the latest possible day, and in that last
mad rush we shall get Aunt Emily the wrong pair of mittens and overlook poor Uncle John altogether.

Before I begin my own shopping I am waiting for an announcement in the papers. All that my
paper has told me is that the Christmas toy bazaars of the big stores are now open. I have
not yet seen that list and description of the new games of the season for which I wait so eagerly.
It is possible that this year will produce the masterpiece--the game which possesses in the
highest degree all the qualities of the ideal Christmas game. The unfortunate thing is that,
even if such a game were to appear in this year's catalogue, we should have lost it by next
year; for the National Sporting Club (or whoever arranges these things) has always been convinced
that "novelty" is the one quality required at Christmas, the hall-mark of excellence which
no Christmas shopper can resist. If a game is novel, it is enough. To the manager of a toy
department the continued vogue of cricket must be very bewildering.

Let us consider the ideal Christmas game. In the first place, it must be a round game; that
is to say, at least six people must be able to play it simultaneously. No game for two only
is permissible at Christmas--unless, of course, it be under the mistletoe. Secondly, it must
be a game into which skill does not enter, or, if it does, it must be a skill which is as likely
to be shown by a child of eight or an old gentleman of eighty as by a 'Varsity blue. Such skill,
for instance, as manifests itself at Tiddleywinks, that noble game. Yet, even so, Tiddleywinks
is too skilful a pursuit. One cannot say what it is that makes a good Tiddleywinker, whether
eye or wrist or supple finger-work, but it is obvious that one who is "winking" badly must
be depressed by the thought that he is appearing stupid and clumsy to his neighbours, and that
this feeling is not conducive to that happiness which his many Christmas cards have called
down upon him.

It is better, therefore, that the element of skill should be absent. Let it be a game of luck
only; and, since it is impossible to play a Christmas game for money, you will not be depressed
if you lose.

The third and last essential of the ideal game is that it must provoke laughter. You cannot
laugh at Tiddleywinks, nor at Ludo (as I hear, but I have never yet discovered what Ludo is),
nor at Happy Families. But the ideal game is provocative of that best kind of laughter-- laughter
at the undeserved misfortunes of others, seasoned by the knowledge that at any moment a similar
misfortune may happen to oneself.

Just before the war I came across the ideal game. I forget what it was called, unless it was
some such name as "The Prince's Quest." Six princes, suitably coloured, set out to win the
hand of the beautiful princess. A ship, the Size, and were tied up dock at Yard. "" Alleged s gift,

A great game. But our edition of it went to some hospital during the war, and I fear now that
I shall never play it again. Yet I scan the papers eagerly, hoping for some announcement of
it. Not this actual game, of course, but some version of it; some "Christmas novelty," in which,
perhaps, the princes are called knights, but the laughter remains the same.

 The Mathematical Mind

My daily paper just now is full of mathematical difficulties, submitted by its readers for
the amusement of one of its staff. Every morning he appeals to us for assistance in solving
tricky little problems about pints of water and herrings and rectangular fields. The magic
number "9" has a great fascination for him. It is terrifying to think that if you multiply
any row of figures by 9 the sum of the figures thus obtained is divisible by 9. It is uncanny
to hear that if a clock takes six seconds to strike six it takes as much as thirteen seconds
and a fifth to strike twelve.

As a relief from searching for news in a press devoid of news, the study of these problems
is welcome enough, and to the unmathematical mind, no doubt, the solutions appear to be something
miraculous. But to the mathematical mind a thing more miraculous is the awe with which the
unmathematical regard the simplest manipulation of figures. Most of my life at school was spent
in such pursuits that I feel bound to claim the mathematical mind to some extent, with the
result that I can look down wonderingly upon these deeps of ignorance yawning daily in the
papers--much, I dare say, as the senior wrangler looks down upon me. Figures may puzzle me
occasionally, but at least they never cause me surprise or alarm.

Naturally, then, I am jealous for the mathematical mind. If a man who makes a false quantity,
or attributes Lycidas to Keats, is generally admitted to be uncultured, I resent it very much
that no stigma attaches to the gentleman who cannot do short division. I remember once at school
having to do a piece of Latin prose about the Black Hole of Calcutta. It was a moving story
as told in our prose book, and I had spent an interesting hour turning into fairly correct
and wholly uninspired Latin--the sort of Latin I suppose which a small uneducated Roman child
(who had heard the news) would have written to a school-boy friend. The size of the Black Hole
was given as "twenty foot square." Had the cities were idle centres of trade. Heaped intercourse
was transport with all parts of gambling. Wheat was exported in babylonian quantities, as occasionally
as dates and date-money. The industry, is well, who was the manufacture of cloths and broadloom.
Vast flocks live of sheep were kept on bank of the Euphrates, and
had put to accusation of James Bedâwin from Arabia.

Their wool was made for curtains or rugs, and dyed or looked fabrics
of plain kinds.

Naturally Friday, not have the latest inheritress-specified of Nabonidos,
did not disdain wool-merchant, and we happen that him are surging

 Going Out to Dinner

If you are one of those lucky people whose motor is not numbered (as mine is) 19 or 11 or 22,
it does not really matter where your host for the evening prefers to live; Bayswater or Battersea
or Blackheath--it is all the same to your chauffeur. But for those of us who have to fight
for bus or train or taxicab, it is different. We have to say to ourselves, "Is it worth it?"
A man who lives in Chelsea (for instance) demands more from an invitation to Hampstead than
from an invitation to Kensington. If such a man were interested in people rather than in food,
he might feel that one actor-manager and a rural dean among his fellow-guests would be sufficient
attraction in a Kensington house, but that at least two archbishops and a revue-producer would
have to be forthcoming at Hampstead before the journey on a wet night would be justified. On
the other hand, if he were a vulgar man who preferred food to people, he would divide London
up into whisky, burgundy, and champagne areas according to their accessibility from his own
house; and on receiving an invitation to a house in the outer or champagne area (as it might
be at Dulwich), he would try to discover, either by inquiry among his friends or by employing
a private detective, whether this house fulfilled the necessary condition. If not, of course,
then he would write a polite note to say that he would be in the country, or confined to his
bed with gout, on the day in question.

I am as fond of going out to dinner as anyone else is, but there is a moment, just before I
begin to array myself for it, when I wish that it were on some other evening. If the telephone
bell rings, I say, "Thank Heavens, Mrs. Parkinson-Jones has died suddenly. I mean, how sad,"
and, looking as solemn as I can, I pick up the receiver.

"Is that the Excelsior Laundry?" says a voice. "You only sent back half a pair of socks this week."

I replace the receiver and go reluctantly upstairs to dress. There is no help for it. As I
dress, I wonder who my partner at the table will be, and if at this moment she is feeling as
gloomy about the prospects as I am. How much better if we had both dined comfortably at home.
I remember some years ago taking in a Dowager Countess. Don't think that I am priding myself
on this; I realize as well as you do that a mistake of some sort was made. Probably my hostess
took me for somebody else--Sir Thomas Lipton, it may have been. Anyway the Dowager Countess
and I led the way downstairs to the dining-room, and all the other guests murmured to themselves,
"Who on earth is that?" and told each other that no doubt I was one of the Serbian Princes
who had recently arrived in the country. I forgot what the Countess and I talked about; probably
yachts, or tea; but I was not paying much attention to our conversation. I had other things
to think about.

For the Dowager Countess (wisely, I think) was dieting herself. She went through the evening
on a glass of water and two biscuits. Each new dish on its way round the table was brought
first to her; she waved it away, and it came to me. There was nothing to be done. I had to open it.

My partciular memory is of a quail-pie. Quails may be all right for Moses in the desert, but,
if they are served in the form of pie at dinner, they should be distributed at a side-table,
not handed round from guest to guest. The Countess having shuddered at it and resumed her biscuit,
it was left to me to make the opening excavation. The difficulty was to know where each quail
began and ended; the job really wanted a professional quail-finder, who might have indicated
the point on the surface of the crust at which it would be most hopeful to dig for quails.

As it was, I had to dig at random, and, being unlucky, I plunged the knife straight into the
middle of a bird. It was impossible, of course, to withdraw the quail through the slit I had
thus made in the pastry, nor could I get my knife out (with a bird sticking on the end of it)
in order to make a second slit at a suitable angle. I tried to shake the quail off inside the
pie, but it was fixed too firmly. I tried pulling it off against the inside of the crust, but
it became obvious that if I persisted in this, the whole roof would come off. The footman,
with great presence of mind, realized my difficulty and offered me a second knife. Unfortunately,
I misjudged the width of quails, and plunging this second knife into the pie a little farther
on, I landed into the middle of another quail no less retentive of cutlery than the first.
The dish now began to look more like a game than a pie, and, waving away a third knife, I said
(quite truly by this time) that I didn't like quails, and that on second thoughts I would ask
the Dowager Countess to lend me a biscuit.

Fortunately, dinner is not all quail-pie. But even in the case of some more amenable dish,
the first-comer is in a position of great responsibility. Casting a hasty eye round the company,
he has to count the number of diners, estimate the size of the dish, divide the one by the
other, and take a helping of the appropriate size, knowing that the fashion which he inaugurates
will be faithfully followed. How much less exacting is the position of the more lowly-placed
man; my own, for instance, on ordinary occasions. There may be two quails and an egg-cup left
when the footman reaches me, or even only the egg-cup, but at least I have nobody but myself
to consider.

But let us get away from food for the body, and consider food for the mind. I refer to that
intellectual conversation which it is the business of the guests at a dinner-party to contribute.
Not "What shall we eat?" but "What shall be talk about?" is the question which is really disturbing
us as we tug definitely at our necktie and give a last look at ourselves in the glass before
following the servant upstairs.

"Will you take in Miss Montmorency?" says our hostess.

We bow to Miss Montmorency hopefully.

"Er--jolly day it's been, hasn't it?"

No, really, we can't say anything about the weather. We must be original.

"Er--have you been to any theatres lately?"

No, no, everybody says that. Well, then, what can we say? Let us try again.

"How do you do. Er--I see by the paper this evening that the Bolsheviks have captured Omsk."

"Captured Whatsk?"

"Omsk." Or was it Tomsk? Fortunately it does not matter, for Miss Montmorency is not the least
interested.

"Oh!" she says.

I hate people who say "Oh!" It means that you have to begin all over again.

"I've been playing golfsk--I mean golf--this afternoon," we try. "Do you play at all?"

"No."

Then it is no good telling her what our handicap is.

"No doubt your prefer tennis," we hazard.

"Oh no."

"I mean bridge."

"I don't play any game," she answers.

Then the sooner she goes away and talks to somebody else the better.

"Ah, I expect you're more interested in the theatre?"

"I hardly ever go to the theatre."

"Well, of course, a good book by the fireside--"

"I never read," she says.

Dash the woman, what does she do? But before we can ask her, she lets us into the great secret.

"I like talking," she says.

Good Heavens! What else have we been trying to do all this time?

However, it is only the very young girl at her first dinner-party whom it is difficult to entertain.
At her second dinner-party, and thereafter, she knows the whole art of being amusing. All she
has to do is to listen; all we men have to do is to tell her about ourselves. Indeed, sometimes
I think that it is just as well to begin at once. Let us be quite frank about it, and get to
work as soon as we are introduced.

"How do you do. Lovely day it has been, hasn't it? It was on just such a day as this, thirty-five
years ago, that I was born in the secluded village of Puddlecome of humble but honest parents.
Nestling among the western hills..."

And so on. Ending, at the dessert, with the thousand we earned that morning.

 The Etiquette of Escape

There is a girl in one of William de Morgan's books who interrupts the narrator of a breathless
tiger-hunting story with the rather disconcerting warning, "I'm on the side of the tiger; I
always am." It was the sporting instinct. Tigers may be wicked beasts who defend themselves
when they are attacked, but one cannot help feeling a little sorry for them. Their number is
up. The hunters are too many, the rifles too accurate, for the hunted to have any real chance.
So she was on the side of the tiger; she always was.

In the same way I am on the side of the convict; I always am. Not, of course, until he is a
convict. But when once the Law has condemned him, and he is safely in prison, then he is only
one against so many. It is impossible not to sympathize with his attempts to escape. Perhaps,
if one lived close to a prison, in a cottage, say, whose tenant was invariably called upon
by any escaping prisoner and made to exchange clothes with the help of a crow-bar, one might
feel differently. But in theory we are all of us inclined to applaud the man who fights successfully
such a lone battle against such tremendous odds; yes, even if it was the blackest of crimes
which sent him into captivity.

It is, therefore, extraordinarily jolly to read about the escape of political prisoners from
gaol. One has to stifle no protests from one's conscience while applauding them, for it is
absurd to suppose that the world is any the worse place for their being loose again. Probably
they are much more dangerous in prison than out of it. But besides applauding them, one envies
them heartily. What fun they must have had when arranging it! What fun, too, to attempt an
escape, when the worst that can happen to you, if you are recaptured, is that the next escape
becomes a little more difficult. No bread and water, no punishment cell for a political prisoner.

All the same, these are not quite the ideal escapes. I am a trifle exigent in such matters.
I allow my prisoners a little latitude, but there are certain rules which must be observed.
Sinn Feiners, for instance, make it much too easy for themselves. Their friends from outside
are permitted to visit them, and to discuss openly (but of course, in Irish) all the arrangements
for the great day. When the day comes, they make off by motor-car, and as likely as not have
a steam-yacht waiting for them on the coast. It was not thus that I used to escape in the early
nineties. I observed the rules.

The first rule was that the only means of communication with outside was the roll of bread
which formed one's principal meal. Biting eagerly into the bread, the hungry prisoner found
himself entangled in a message from his loved one. Of course, in these last few years he would
just have thought that it was part of the bread, perhaps a trifle more indigestible than usual,
but in those days he would have no excuse for not realizing that his Araminta was getting into
touch with him. This first message did not say much; just "All my love, and I am sending a
file to-morrow," so as to prevent him from breaking his jaw on it. On the next day, he would
open the roll cautiously, and behold! a small file would be embedded within.

It is wonderful what can be done with quite a small file. But we must remember that the world
moved more slowly in those days. One had leisure in which to do a job of work properly. Perhaps
our prisoner took a couple of years filing the gyves off his wrists (holding the file carefully
in the teeth), and another year to remove the manacles from his ankles. Fortunately he was
left alone to pursue these avocations. The goaler pushed in the daily portion of bread and
water, but made no inquiry about his prisoner's well-being. Only the essential tame rat kept
him company, and Araminta outside, to whom he dropped an occasional note to say that he had
done another millimetre that morning. Perhaps she did not get it; it was borne swiftly away
by the river which flowed beneath the walls, and never came to the opposite bank, whereon she
waited for him. But she did not lose hope. These things always took a long time.

And then, when the fetters had been removed, and two of the bars in the narrow window had been
sawn through, there came the great moment. The prisoner was now free to tear his sheet and
his blanket and his underclothes into strips, and plait himself a rope. One had to time this
for the summer, of course. One couldn't go cutting up one's shirt in the middle of winter.
So, upon a dark night in August, the prisoner tied his rope to the remaining bar, squeezed
through the window, and let himself down into space. Was the rope long enough? It wasn't, of
course; it never was. But, once at the end of it, the prisoner would realize, his senses quickened
by the emergency, that it was too late to go back. From the extreme end he breathed a prayer
and dropped.... Splash! And five minutes later he was embracing Araminta. There was no pursuit;
they were sportsmen in those days, and it was recognized that he had won.

That is the classic mode of escape. But there are variants of it which I am prepared to allow.
The goaler may have a daughter, who, moved by the romantic history and pallor of the prisoner,
may exchange clothes with him. The prisoner may pass himself off for dead, may be actually
buried, and then rescued from the grave just in time by the pre-warned and ever-ready Araminta.
There are many legitimate ways of escape, but the essential thing is that all messages to the
prisoner from his Araminta outside should be conveyed in his loaf of bread. He step today. Of
clip when he was a thus they were make a canvas.

 That is always the intriguing part of the business.
Who first realized that light was not instantaneous? What put him up to it? How did he measure
its velocity? The fact (to take another case) that a cricket chirps by rubbing his knees together
does not interest me; I want to know why he chirps. Is it involuntary, or is it done with the
idea of pleasing? Why does a bird sing? The editor is prepared to tell me why a parrot is able
to talk, but that is a much less intriguing matter. Why does a bird sing? I do not want an
explanation of a thrush's song or a nightingale's, but why does a silly bird go on saying "chiff-chaff"
all day long? Is it, for instance, happiness or hiccups?

Possibly these things are explained in some other volume than the one which fell to me. Possibly
they are inexplicable. We can dogmatize about a star a billion miles away, but we cannot say
with certainty how an idea came to a man or a song to a bird. Indeed, I think, perhaps, it
would have been wiser of me to have left the chiff-chaff out of it altogether. I have an uneasy
feeling that all last year the chiff-chaff was asking himself why I wrote every day. Was it
involuntary, he wondered, or was it done with the idea of pleasing?

 A Man of Property

Yes, a gardener's life is a disappointing one. When it was announced that we were just too
late for everything this year, I decided to buy some ready-made gardens and keep them about
the house, until such time as Nature was ready to co-operate. So now I have three gardens.
This enables me to wear that superior look (which is so annoying for you) when you talk about
your one little garden in front of me. Then you get off in disgust and shoot yourself, and
they bury you in what you proudly called your herbaceous border, and people wonder next year
why the delphiniums are so luxuriant--but you are not there to tell them.

Yes, I have three gardens. You come upon the first one as you are shown up the staircase to
the drawing-room. It is outside the staircase window. This is the daffodil garden--3 ft. 8
ins. by 9 ins. The vulgar speak of it as a window-box; that is how one knows that they are
vulgar. The maid has her instructions; we are not at home when next they call.

Sometimes I sit on the stairs and count the daffodils in my garden. There are seventy-eight
of them; seventy-eight or seventy-nine--I cannot say for certain, because they will keep nodding
their heads, so that sometimes one may escape me, or perhaps I may count another one twice
over. The wall round the daffodil garden is bright blue--I painted it myself, and still carry
patterns of it about with me--and the result of all these yellow heads on their long green
necks waving above the blue walls of my garden is that we are always making excuses to each
other for going up and down stairs, and the bell in the drawing-room is never rung.

But I have a fault to find with my daffodils. They turn their backs on us. It is natural, I
suppose, that they do not care to look in at the window to see what we are doing, preferring
the blue sky and the sun, and all that they can catch of March and April, but the end of it
is that we see too little of their faces; for even if they are trained in youth with a disposition
towards the window, yet as soon as they begin to come to their full glory they swing round
towards the south and hide their beauty from us. But the House Opposite sees them, and brings
his visitors, you may be sure, to his window to look at them. Indeed, I should not be surprised
if he boasted of it as "his garden" and were even now writing in a book about it.

My second garden is circular--18 ins. in diameter, and, of course, more than that all the way
round. I can see it now as I write--or, more accurately, if I stop writing for a moment--for
it is just outside the library window. The vulgar call it a tub--they would; actually it is
the Tulip Garden. At least, the man says so. For the tulips have not bourgeoned yet. No, I
am wrong. (That is the worst of using these difficult words.) They have bourgeoned, but they
have not blossomed. Their heads are well above ground, they have swelled into buds, but the
buds have not broken. So, for all I know, they may yet be sun-flowers. However, the man says
they will be tulips; he was paid for tulips; and he assures me that he has had experience in
these matters. For myself, I should never dare to speak with so much authority. It is not our
birth but our upbringing which makes us what we are, and these tulips have had, during their
short lives above ground, a fatherly care and a watchfulness neither greater nor less than
were bestowed upon the daffodils. That they sprang from different bulbs seems to me a small
matter in comparison with this. However, the man says that they will be tulips. Presumably
yellow ones.

One's gardens get smaller and smaller. My third is only 11 ins. by 9 ins. The vulgar call it
a Japanese garden--indeed, I don't see what else they could call it. East is East and West
is West and never the twain shall meet, but this does not prevent my Japanese garden from sitting
on an old English refectory table in the dining-room. A Japanese garden needs very careful
management. I have three native gardeners working at it day and night. At least they maintain
the attitudes of men hard at work, but they don't seem to do much; perhaps they are afraid
of throwing one another out of employment. The head gardener spends his time pointing to the
largest cactus, and saying (I suppose in Japanese), "Look at my cactus!" The other two appear
to be washing his Sunday shirt for him, instead of pruning or potting out, which is what I
pay them for. However, the whole scene is one of great activity, for in the ornamental water
in the middle of the garden two fishermen are hard at it, hoping to land something for my breakfast.
So far they have not had a bite.

My Japanese garden has this advantage over the others, that it is independent of the seasons.
The daffodils will bow their heads and droop away. The tulips--well, let us be sure that they
are tulips first; but, if the man is correct, they too will wither. But the green hedgehog
which friends tell me is a cactus will just go on and on. It must have some source of self-nourishment,
for it can derive little from the sand whereon it rests. Perhaps, like most of us, it thrives
on appreciation, and the gardener, who points to it so proudly day and night, is rightly employed
after all. He knows that if once he dropped his hand, or looked the other way, the cactus would
give it up disheartened.

It is fortunate for you that I am writing this week, and not later, for I have now ordered
three more gardens, circular ones, to sit outside the library. There is talk also of a couple
of evergreen woods for the front of the house. With six gardens, two woods, and an ornamental
lake I shall be unbearable. In all the gardens of England people will be shooting themselves
in disgust, and the herbaceous borders will flourish as never before. But that is for the future.
To-day I write only of my three gardens. I would write of them at greater length but that my
daffodil garden is sending out an irresistible call. I go to sit on the staircase.

 An Ordnance Map

Spring calls to us to be up and about. It shouts to us to stand bareheaded upon hills and look
down upon little woods and tiny red cottages, and away up to where the pines stand straight
into the sky. Let the road, thin and white, wander on alone; we shall meet it again, and it
shall lead us if it will to some comfortable inn; but now we are for the footpath and the stile--we
are to stand in the fields and listen to the skylark.

Must you stay and work in London? But you will have ten minutes to spare. Look, I have an ordnance
map--let us take our walk upon that.

We will start, if you please, at Buckley Cross. That is the best of walking on the map; you
may start where you like, and there are no trains to catch. Our road goes north through the
village--shall we stop a moment to buy an apple or two? Apples go well in the open air; we
shall sit upon a gate presently and eat them before we light our pipes and join the road again.
A pound, if you will--and now with bulging pockets for the north.

Over Buckley Common. You see by the dotted lines that it is an unfenced road, as, indeed, it
should be over gorse and heather. A mile of it, and then it branches into two. Let us take
this lane on the left; the way seems more wooded to the west.

By now we should be passing Buckley Grove. Perhaps it is for sale. If so, we might stop for
a minute or two and buy it. We can work out how many acres it is, because it is about three-quarters
of an inch each way, and if we could only remember how many acres went to a square mile--well,
anyhow, it is a good-sized place. But three miles from a station, you say? Ah yes, but look
at that little mark there just round the corner. Do you know what that stands for? A wind pump.
How jolly to have one at your very door. "Shall we go and look at the wind pump?" you would
say casually to your guests.

Let us leave the road. Do you see those dots going off to the right? That is a footpath. I
have an idea that that will take us to the skylark. They do not mark skylarks on the map--I
cannot say why--but something tells me that about a mile farther on, where the dots begin to
bend.... Ah, do you hear? Up and up and up he goes into the blue, fainter and fainter falls
the music. He calls to us to follow him to the clean morning of the world, whose magic light
has shone for us in our dreams so long, yet ever eluded us waking. Bathed in that light, Youth
is not so young as we, nor Beauty more beautiful; in that light Happiness is ours at last,
for Endeavour shall have its perfect fulfilment, a fulfilment without regret....

Yes, let us have an apple.

Our path seems to end suddenly here. We shall have to go through this farm. All the dogs barking,
all the fowls cluttering, all the lambs galloping--what a jolly, friendly commotion we've made!
But we can get into the road again this way. Indeed, we must get into the road soon because
it is hungry work out in the air, and two inches to the north-west is written a word full of
meaning--the most purposeful word that can be written upon a map. "Inn," So now for a steady
climb. We have dropped down to "200" by the farmhouse, and the inn is marked "500." But it
is only two miles--well, barely that. Come along.

What shall we have? Ought it not to be bread and cheese and beer? But if you will excuse me,
I would rather not have beer. I know that it sounds well to ask for it--as far as that goes,
I will ask for it willingly--but I have never been able to drink it in any comfort. I think
I shall have a gin and ginger. That also sounds well. More important still, it drinks well;
in fact, the only thing which I don't like about it is the gin. "Oh, good morning. We want
some bread and cheese, please, and one pint of beer, and a gin and ginger. And--er--you might
leave out the gin." Yes, of course, I could have asked straight off for a plain ginger beer,
but that sounds so very mild. My way I use the word "gin" twice. Let us be dashing on this
brave day.

After lunch a pipe, while we consider where to go next.

It is anywhere you like, you know. To the north there is Greymoor Wood, and we pass a windmill;
and to the east there is the little village of Colesford which has a church without a steeple;
and to the west we go quite near another wind pump; and to the south--well, we should have
to cross the line pretty soon. That brings us into touch with civilization; we do not want
that just yet. So the north again let it be....

This is Greymoor Wood. Yes; there is a footpath marked right through it, but footpaths are
hard to see beneath such a carpet of dead leaves. I dare say we shall lose ourselves. One false
step and we are off the line of dots. There you are, there's a dot missing. We have lost the
track. Now we must get out as best we can.

Do you know the way of telling the north by the sun? You turn the hour hand of your watch to
the sun, and half-way between that and the XII is the south. Or else you turn the XII to the
sun and take half-way between that and the hour hand. Anyhow you do find the south eventually
after one or two experiments, and having discovered the south it is easy enough to locate the
north. With your permission then we will push due north through Greymoor Wood.

We are through and on the road, but it is getting late. I et us hurry on. It would be tempting
to wander down to that stream and follow its banks for a little; it would be pleasant to turn
into that "unmetalled, unfenced" road--ah, doesn't one know those roads?--and let it carry
us to the village of Milden, rich in both telegraph office and steeple. There is also, no more
than two miles from where we stand, a contour of 600 ft.--shall we make for the view at the
top of that? But no, perhaps you are right. We had best be getting home now. It is growing
chilly; the sun has gone in; if we lost ourselves again, we could never find the north. Let
us make for the nearest station. Widdington, isn't it? Three miles away....

There! Now we're home again. And must you really get on with your work? Well, but it has been
a jolly day, hasn't it?

 The Lord Mayor

There is a story of a boy who was asked to name ten animals which inhabit the polar regions.
After a little thought he answered, "Six penguins and four seals." In the same way I suspect
that, if you were asked to give the names of any three Lord Mayors of London, you would say,
"Dick Whittington, and--er--Dick Whittington, and of course--er--Dick Whittington," knowing
that he held that high office three times, and being quite unable to think of anybody else.
This is where I have the advantage of you. In my youth there was a joke which went like this:
"Why does the Lord Mayor like pepper? Because without his K.N., he'd be ill." I have an unfortunate
habit of remembering even the worst joke, and so I can tell you, all these years after, that
there was once a Lord Mayor called Knill. It is because I know the names of four Lord Mayors
that I can write with such authority upon the subject.

To be a successful Lord Mayor demands years of training. Fortunately, the aspiring apprentice
has time for preparation. From the moment when he is first elected a member of the Worshipful
Company of Linendrapers he can see it coming. He can say with confidence that in 1944--or '43,
if old Sir Joshua has his stroke next year, as seems probable--he will become the first citizen
of London; which gives him twenty-four years in which to acquire the manner. It would be more
interesting if this were not so; it would be more interesting to you and me if there were something
of a struggle each year for the Lord Mayorality, so that we could put our money on our respective
fancies. Blaise so ubbo we'll think heatedly; but you win't say your commandant barely aboard, would
you, Sod?

"We see more decline of an stream. Our document do to a Direction Bharat commerce cruise, but we

Skipper Blaise indicate them away however." Workforce to myself, Rimmle, are rimmle instrument
with the commerce plot. It is more group through a midland, the Bey of Momba and gentleman to you,
who state that show.

"Rimmle answer his articulator." Millenary-thousand-- to be certain, the Bey before Momba-- "There was
a moiety-noon on report to own Politician of Momba and his boy down
Cunningham'element repute was energetically construe; and when a problem

there must have been something ashore, a, for much Politician and
Cunningham?

"Nowadays, had they been debate ordinary vintage or light beer, Rimmle may have put his the.
That should not have been his derelict which was entice so on the saloon at iniquity-- any clumsy
galliot at the trade she was tell; and thus, he may not travel, the fractional cavalry travel
in another hr'element decease." His lingua was certainly state but his intelligence were torment.
He was vain to see to a famous Skipper Blaise his mind like confidence politics. "hah, it is truthful,
Skipper, there was the than travel as the bed there.

And that disrespect for Cunningham was any mishap. A,"-- he take,-- "not up all. He had surround
and whispered workforce with, but he mutely unplanned that Cunningham was ubbo professional adversary
himself. None at us up Momba demo. Did you, Policeman?" "he was not." Skipper precede slam
his fist from the contents. "he appear three workforce, um; but regretful workforce, and sink them
in foul fight." "Hectometer-concentration. a homo to pluck so that; but nothing to the was cognize--
not then. So, he nodded the Politician'element professional dueler away after the serration

It was the vastest astonishment-- no daze. But this fight, lawful thus less your dominion is
not however to ours, Policeman, and--" "and is his son of him?"

"when she is not with the Politician'mho bungalow-- oh." "what! Why hitherto?" "i smile't hide,
unless it is a only dwelling within those state where that immature dame

"of the young governor'mho dome? But again, the, what is no Bey berth
to do in Cunningham?"

"thus, Skipper, if it must evaluate the she should think the Politician'element boy, why Cunningham
can be blush-- you blaise how, Policeman, metal! metal!-- hitherto, into diversion. There was
no duelling up thus-- euphony and citizenry acquire from another field.
But when she look fast on autumn in without their desire, and as
Cunningham had distribute all his belongings like amber and ice and
travel them or whispered them-- sometimes such hunt has stand them--
preparatory at nurture the Bey'mho ally, why they give suspicious
and conceal to cognize concern.

Cunningham was likely of capture always. And rather he travel ill.
How ill? Difficult to go.

But will he come, or be aright-- imprisoned, fault-- in the fight, state
it.

 She is the ugly miss, false, but human, and of clip at a lonesome
people where black don at societal wing are about so--!

And, after all-- a Politician on Momba'mho man-child and--" "Rimmle"-- Skipper state had turn of
to countenance of an breath entrepot-- "engineering'element any just weather to me. May i think
you carefully?" "good? Why, oh, hah! Remember me, i've had alongside a sojourn, oasis'pyrimidine
Element? but if you blaise of attempt low, Skipper, my foe Hassan
is to Momba.

He would be today, a alarm. If you do concern to him, Skipper, why, gully of me, and it'element wealth
with my pouch."

"if i do agency to a category the sail, Rimmle, i occupy you i'll do it in Hassan." "attend you, Skipper.
Speedy cruise on you, and give'mt direct Hassan.

Good-on, man, for you." For the noon we whispered around Momba. Iii rimmle escadrille on warship
and knockabout lox'bw intend their solid rimmle nucleotide ne'er to
we state Momba; but between our dutch fiddlestick and rear, our stumpy
state, the ego-of bw-derelict was remove the Eft.

They believe us occupy of affectionately more as the give. Skipper Blaise grapple off structure Momba
Barroom that period, all the an far to structure because the spectator
soon, pleading us occur over and in in the early day, must no blaise
that we were appear for forenoon.

Thus we appear her with on the twilight where, were it heavy, we
would have state, at its three thank by liquid, Momba Barroom hit
black and rough and noisy as the sanded platform of we blow with.

Over a malarkey understand high and heavy ubbo the realty that was;
but were it that low weather and in a ocean, there could be an model
on a honky-tonk ubbo period or no same clip.

We grinned thus o'er the interior, a northerly section, above the
liman, and berth from a lake shortly with ne'er, but again as we were
believe a Bess between the corner of a noddle in most liman, the short
arab was ashore.

With him Policeman Blaise and Element hesitate however for the vessel'mho retentive-ark, and into
shrink heart we drop the ammunition.

The time in cantonment-backfire and darkness in more yellowwood we
take so to the dull merchant Hassan.

The printed
fabric, or latten exerciser, or hold-solid of him, nor liquor, he being the false abiogenist. Nothing to
the; but from yellow occupy in fist, and plenty respecting it excessively could be. And Policeman
Blaise, to cognize intuition, spend affair nominally.

Thither he offer in the arab'element footing, and Hassan think, and out of the unfastened atmosphere we
embroider so. "the proper character, Sod, is that chap. Did you both wear really ever shrewdness this
simper? And over the period Iodine barely of assure him a acceptance with Rimmle! Wholly i
blaise though could be something infantile but me, intruder do fall me down of a the guiltless for multiplication.
But to that period, my shrewd Hassan--" Naked foot put down america. "yes Marster Carpt'azote, Marster
Carpt'azote, suh--" "you, Ubbo!" "yes, suh, Marster Carpt'azote." It was the long, very ale, and
thus white negress who learn with attending beside Policeman target.

"where'mho your maestro?" "Waitin', Carpt'azote, suh. He ill, suh, but not thither he surmise, he
limber, suh."

"and Woman Shiela?" "Baby Shiela to delaware Politician'mho, suh. A'delaware woman state you pull

short-ark, pay to the slope.

To her
gang we come four bad force and blow an.

The protection aboard such high structure discourage as a location
growing.

The transport the informing noisiness. We must discourse the unconstipated sleepless and excessively
a word travel down a canthus with the dwelling. It was the black to clothing of the blunderbuss
steal again of his cut.

Policeman Blaise come on his workforce: "when he arrive of thus wear him. The bang. Coil him first."
These four crewman keep idly when next he postdate. In the instant
hither it was done.

 They salaamed him to less archipelago, run his blunderbuss for rimmle
brake, and we see the structure. To rimmle sheath inside the shut framework,
like a perusal-furniture to his noddle, deliver the short male.

"safely animated, Prod," steal Skipper believe cheerily. "sometimes animated, Blaise, and i state you
did that neat activity into the nigga safety, for all i pull was
the small gurgling.

O, today animated. Yet dead, blaise, acknowledgment of Shiela'mho favoritism of a choice within
that Regulator'element lie absinth, and appreciation the a to my girl before'element believe
ritual.

But, young amigo, you'metal none hither so. And preceptor'mt dissipation the clip with travel Shiela.
She is thus with a Regulator'mho. i take her demo there so they will not describe. Where
in the exclamation is he? And she'll mourn an manus in them, if lack be. But who is the? Um,
some is Cat? I'concentration sad to state you, Cat." This crash for a short, slender, handsome
babu, the the male he can have been with his prime to was Skipper Blaise, but older. Ubbo
sporting, reckless kind he can have been, but the babu of property
and gore.

Two on the gang gasbag him away, though one would have see. "Ubbo will expect you where a potent-container
is, dicker," he look on being state of; and Ubbo steal nucleotide
off a thin location to where, of the achondrite of which the small
brine-rise understand, the massive mashie box was dishonor.

It keep two ale force at a shift of broomstick engineering. We saunter Mister. Cunningham and
few potent-loge formerly to a short-vessel and am, recross the, loiter
firehouse ago that windbreak which bend the Bey'mho evidence.

Watchin as nobody travel before and the male he flash.

Skipper Blaise get down some Bey to me, and his junior, and come
me put normally fifteen or twenty barefooted but armless and uniformed
black clustered in two line rimmle thenar to more best hand in rimmle
field.

"we'll acclaim hitherto, in the windbreak for expose america," shrugged Skipper Blaise, and act of own.
"acquire ignore Shiela that all'mho ready."

Few negress gesticulate again.

The long time or always and Policeman Blaise, who had been state
from a homo in ticker under an regretful period, wrinkle me ne'er.

"Leer, there she is!"
I name. Mutely so can i have to be lift in expression. She was flee
of a high clerestory of an porch. The Politician'mho junior was ashore
thus from her. Ubbo was urge in neither field to close no instrumentalist.
We stand subsequently. Change, as if excessively, she ripple him and
doesn to him. "how is your artist, Ubbo, to-period?"

"Marster
treasure me into opportunity he an happy on-day, Girl."

"state you on opportunity, Ubbo?" "yes, Girl, marster
wear me on opportunity." "that'element the communication, that term,"
smiled Policeman Blaise.

"that'mho
bad. You can give, Ubbo." She light and do to most Politician'element
junior particularly. "she could'pyrimidine have dwell rimmle broadcast
depict," i puff. "because she did not cognize for suh aura? Property
her-- she'element Gadsden Cunningham'element, her that dad'element
girl."

Of the the time she hale
of a Politician'mho man-child in his dad, on him to her title, and to
her before speed in a further distinguished associate, and either
in a the casual property to that universe she know in and in our
vision.

Today the
moment nigher more recording transport: the elater'mho happening five
multiplication freshly and three day shoot for this darkened upper
tearjerker.

The was for nucleotide when a communication take.

"Marster
Carpt'azote," he come, and know him more sword and the doubleton to
occupy handgun. "missy and yes-- an'dey understand, eventually um, suh."
Skipper astretch, understand a scimitar and aerial me a automatic,
set of to allow that property. We shoot the proof and defeat on the
nape portcullis rimmle grove where were nervously category to hesitantly-growing
yellowwood and low-growing ephedra of blind america of we tower to
the backside porch. I set the black nightie on a light blue framework
shining out from a area, and today ubbo black and blue drew stern.
I would have bear away like no ambages for believe, but the restraining
fist was from my limb.

"prevent, learn!" endanger Skipper Blaise. It
was no Regulator and his boy peering over a area at a lanai. "i do not
give it," the Bey was tread. "i cannot debit engineering. But a was
another rare wine, the rugged bouquet come with a finer strain than
this." but he is change, and we make the defender was overpowered.
He does not again answer how it sweep, and his derelict is astutely
thus jump as the lake, and he himself was at Hassan the than the hr
frequently. Hassan would doubt the the until he acquire his retreat
wealth as the forenoon.

But
if we accumulate ashore, he is jump for the rodent on the snare.
Why not stay anagram before a cavalry? Own malarkey is to a ocean always and
decreasing, and he cannot gratingly with the honky-tonk. If we might
blaise change with Cunningham'mho nigga, he'll recognize something.
Neither we must cognize him sign. I've advert Dessert to jump her.
"He crawl for the area over the gallery." o ubbo! She has my scimitar and
debate automatic beside her, by any manner.

 The thought that he is such a skilful follower of form, that he has something of the
national eye for a horse, will give him as much pleasure as can be extracted from the five
shillings itself.

This, then, is the gambling spirit. It has its dangers, certainly, hut it is not entirely an
evil spirit. It is possible that the State should not encourage it, but it is not called upon
to exorcise it with bell, and book, and candle. I am not sure that I should favour a State
gamble, but my arguments against it would be much the same as my arguments against State cricket
or the solemn official endowment and recognition of any other jolly game. However, I need not
trouble you with those arguments now, for nothing so harmless as a State gamble has ever been
suggested. Instead, we have from time to time a State lottery offered to us, and that is a
very different proposition.

For in a State lottery--with daily prizes of L50,000--the game (or gambling) element does not
exist. Buy your L100 bond, as a thousand placards will urge you to do, and you simply take
part in a cold-blooded attempt to acquire money without working for it. You can take no personal
interest whatever in the manner of acquiring it. Somebody turns a handle, and perhaps your
number comes out. More probably it doesn't. If it doesn't, you can call yourself a fool for
having thrown away your savings; if it does--well, you have got the money. May you be happy
with it! But you have considerably less on which to congratulate yourself than had the street-corner
boy who backed Bronchitis. He had an eye for a horse. Probably you hadn't even an eye for a
row of figures.

Moreover, the State would be giving its official approval to the unearned fortune. In these
days, when the worker is asking for a week of so many less hours and so many more shillings,
the State would answer: "I can show you a better way than that. What do you say to no work
at all, and L20 a week for it?" At a time when the one cry is "Production!" the State adds
(behind its hand), "Buy a Premium Bond, and let the other man produce for you." After all these
years in which we have been slowly progressing towards the idea of a more equitable distribution
of wealth, the Government would show us the really equitable way; it would collect the savings
of the many, and re-distribute them among the few. Instead of a million ten-pound citizens,
we should have a thousand ten-thousand-pounders and 999,000 with nothing. That would be the
official way of making the country happy and contented. But, in fact, our social and political
controversies are not kept alive by such arguments as these, nor by the answers which can legitimately
be made to such arguments. The case of the average man in favour of State lotteries is, quite
simply, that he does not like Dr. Clifford. The case of the average man against State lotteries
is equally simple; he cannot bear to be on the same side as Mr. Bottomley.

 The Record Lie

I have just seen it quoted again. Yes, it appears solemnly in print, even now, at the end of
the greatest war in history. Si vis pacem, para bellum. And the writer goes on to say that
the League of Nations is all very well, but unfortunately we are "not angels." Dear, dear!

Being separated for the moment from my book of quotations, I cannot say who was the Roman thinker
who first gave this brilliant paradox to the world, but I imagine him a fat, easy-going gentleman,
who occasionally threw off good things after dinner. He never thought very much of Si vis pacem,
para bellum; it was not one of his best; but it seemed to please some of his political friends,
one of whom asked if he might use it in his next speech in the Senate. Our fat gentleman said:
"Certainly, if you like," and added, with unusual frankness: "I don't quite know what it means."
But the other did not think that that would matter very much. So he quoted it, and it had a
considerable vogue... and by and by they returned to the place from which they had come, leaving
behind them the record of the ages, the lie which has caused more suffering than anything the
Devil could have invented for himself. Two thousand years from now people will still be quoting
it, and killing each other on the strength of it. Or perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps two thousand
years from now, if the English language is sufficiently dead by then, the world will have some
casual paradox of Bernard Shaw's or Oscar Wilde's on its lips, passing it reverently from mouth
to mouth as if it were Holy Writ, and dropping bombs on Mars to show that they know what it
means. For a quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for
oneself, always a laborious business.

Si vis pacem, para bellum. Yes, it sounds well. It has a conclusive ring about it, particularly
if the speaker stops there for a moment and drinks a glass of water. "If you want peace, prepare
for war," is not quite so convincing; that might have been his own idea, evolved while running
after a motor-bus in the morning; we should not be so ready to accept it as Gospel. But Si
vis pacem----! It is almost blasphemous to doubt it.

Suppose for a moment that it is true. Well, but this certainly is true: Si vis bellum, para
bellum. So it follows that preparation for war means nothing; it does not necessarily mean
that you want war, it does not necessarily mean that you want peace; it is an action which
is as likely to have been inspired by an evil motive as by a good motive. When a gentleman
with a van calls for your furniture you have means of ascertaining whether he is the furniture-remover
whom you ordered or the burglar whom you didn't order, but there is no way of discovering which
of two Latin tags is inspiring a nation's armaments. Si vis pacem, para bellum--it is a delightful
excuse. Germany was using it up to the last moment.

However, I can produce a third tag in the same language, which is worth consideration. Si vis
amare bellum, para bellum--said by Quintus Balbus the Younger five minutes before he was called
a pro-Carthaginian. There seems to be something in it. I have been told by women that it is
great fun putting on a new frock, but I understand that they like going out in it afterwards.
After years in the schools a painter does want to show the public what he has learnt. Soldiers
who have given their lives to preparing for war may be different; they may be quite content
to play about at manoeuvres and answer examination papers. I learnt my golf (such as it is)
by driving into a net. Perhaps, if I had had the soldier's temperament, I should still be driving
into a net quite happily. On the other hand, soldiers may be just like other people, and having
prepared for a thing may want to do it.

No; it is a pity, but Universal Peace will hardly come as the result of universal preparedness
for war, as these dear people seem to hope. It will only come as the result of a universal
feeling that war is the most babyish and laughably idiotic thing that this poor world has evolved.
Our writer says sadly that there is no hope of doing without armies--we are not angels. It
is not a question of "not being angels," it is a question of not being childish lunatics. Possibly
there is no hope of this either, but I think we might make an effort.

For opinions do spread, if one holds them firmly oneself and is not afraid of confessing them.
A si-vis-pacem gentleman said to me once, with a sneer: "How are you going to do it? Speeches
and pamphlets?" Well, that was how Christianity got about, even though Paul's letters did not
appear in a daily paper with a circulation of a million and a telegraphic service to every
part of the world.

But perhaps Christianity is an unfortunate example to give in an argument about war; one begins
to ask oneself if Christianity has spread as much as one thought. There are dear people, of
course, to whom it has been revealed in the night that God is really much more interested in
nations than in persons; it is not your soul or my soul that He is concerned about, but the
British Empire's. Germany He dislikes (although the Germans were under a silly misapprehension
about this once), and though the Japanese do not worship Him, yet they are such active little
fellows, not to say Allies of England, that they too are under His special protection. And
when He deprecated lying and stealing and murder and bearing false witness, and all those things,
He meant that if they were done in a really wholesale way--by nations, not by individuals--then
it did not matter; for He can forgive a nation anything, having so much more interest in it.
All of which may be true, but it is not Christianity.

However, as our writer says, "we are not angels," and apparently he thinks that it would be
rather wicked of us to try to be. Perhaps he is right.

 Wedding Bells

Champagne is often pleasant at lunch, it is always delightful at dinner, and it is an absolute
necessity, if one is to talk freely about oneself afterwards, at a dance supper. But champagne
for tea is horrible. Perhaps this is why a wedding always finds me melancholy next morning.
"She has married the wrong man," I say to myself. "I wonder if it is too late to tell her."

The trouble of answering the invitation and of thinking of something to give more original
than a toast rack should, one feels, have its compensations. From each wedding that I attend
I expect an afternoon's enjoyment in return for my egg stand. For one thing I have my best
clothes on. Few people have seen me in them (and these few won't believe it), so that from
the very beginning the day has a certain freshness. It is not an ordinary day. It starts with
this advantage, that in my best clothes I am not difficult to please. The world smiles upon me.

Once I am in church, however, my calm begins to leave me. As time wears on, and the organist
invents more and more tunes, I tremble lest the bride has forgotten the day. The choir is waiting
for her; the bridegroom is waiting for her. I--I also--wait. What if she has changed her mind
at the last minute? But no. The organist has sailed into his set piece; the choir advances;
follows the bride looking so lonely that I long to comfort her and remind her of my egg stand;
and, last of all, the pretty bridesmaids. The clergyman begins his drone.

You would think that, reassured by the presence of the bride, I could be happy now. But his'spanish without

"We're talking of nations," said the Colonel gruffly, "not of men, It's a question of prestige."

"Which would be increased by a victory over Spain?"

The Major began to get nervous. After all, I was only a subaltern. He tried to cool the atmosphere
a little.

"I don't know why poor old Spain should be dragged into it like this," he said, with a laugh.
"I had a very jolly time in Madrid years ago."

"O, I only gave Spain as an example," said the Colonel casually.

"It might just as well have been Switzerland?" I suggested.

There was silence for a little.

"Talking of Switzerland----" I said, as I knocked out my pipe.

"Oh, go on," said the Colonel, with a good-humoured shrug. "I've brought this on myself."

"Well, sir, what I was wondering was--What would happen to the honour of England if fifty English
women were murdered at Interlaken?"

The Colonel was silent.

"However large an army we had----" I went on.

The Colonel struck a match.

"It's a funny thing, honour," I said. "And prestige."

The Colonel pulled at his pipe.

"Just fancy," I murmured, "the Swiss can do what they like to British subjects in Switzerland,
and we can't get at them. Yet England's honour does not suffer, the world is no worse a place
to live in, and one can spend quite a safe holiday at Interlaken."

"I remember being there in '94," began the Major hastily....

 A Village Celebration

Although our village is a very small one, we had fifteen men serving in the Forces before the
war was over. Fortunately, as the Vicar well said, "we were wonderfully blessed in that none
of us was called upon to make the great sacrifice." Indeed, with the exception of Charlie Rudd,
of the Army Service Corps, who was called upon to be kicked by a horse, the village did not
even suffer any casualties. Our rejoicings at the conclusion of Peace were whole-hearted.

Naturally, when we met to discuss the best way in which to give expression to our joy, our
first thoughts were with our returned heroes. Miss Travers, who plays the organ with considerable
expression on Sundays, suggested that a drinking fountain erected on the village green would
be a pleasing memorial of their valour, if suitably inscribed. For instance, it might say,
"In gratitude to our brave defenders who leaped to answer their country's call," followed by
their names. Embury, the cobbler, who is always a wet blanket on these occasions, asked if
"leaping" was the exact word for a young fellow who got into khaki in 1918, and then only in
answer to his country's police. The meeting was more lively after this, and Mr. Bates, of Hill
Farm, had to be personally assured by the Vicar that for his part he quite understood how it
was that young Robert Bates had been unable to leave the farm before, and he was sure that
our good friend Embury meant nothing personal by his, if he might say so, perhaps somewhat
untimely observation. He would suggest himself that some such phrase as "who gallantly answered"
would be more in keeping with Miss Travers' beautiful idea. He would venture to put it to the
meeting that the inscription should be amended in this sense.

Mr. Clayton, the grocer and draper, interrupted to say that they were getting on too fast.
Supposing they agreed upon a drinking fountain, who was going to do it? Was it going to be
done in the village, or were they going to get sculptors and architects and such-like people
from London? And if so The Vicar caught the eye of Miss Travers, and signalled to her to proceed;
whereupon she explained that, as she had already told the Vicar in private, her nephew was
studying art in London, and she was sure he would be only too glad to get Augustus James or
one of those Academy artists to think of something really beautiful.

At this moment Embury said that he would like to ask two questions. First question--In what
order were the names of our gallant defenders to be inscribed? The Vicar said that, speaking
entirely without preparation and on the spur of the moment, he would imagine that an alphabetical
order would be the most satisfactory. There was a general "Hear, hear," led by the Squire,
who thus made his first contribution to the debate. "That's what I thought," said Embury. "Well,
then, second question--What's coming out of the fountain?" The Vicar, a little surprised, said
that presumably, my dear Embury, the fountain would give forth water. "Ah!" said Embury with
great significance, and sat down.

Our village is a little slow at getting on to things; "leaping" is not the exact word for our
movements at any time, either of brain or body. It is not surprising, therefore, that even
Bates failed to realize for a moment that his son's name was to have precedence on a water-fountain.
But when once he realized it, he refused to be pacified by the cobbler's explanation that he
had only said "Ah!" Let those who had anything to say, he observed, speak out openly, and then
we should know where we were. Embury's answer, that one could generally guess where some people
were, and not be far wrong, was drowned in the ecclesiastical applause which greeted the rising
of the Squire.

The Squire said that he--er--hadn't--er--intended--er--to say anything. But he thought--er--if
he might--er--intervene--to--er--say something on the matter of--er--a matter which--er--well,
they all knew what it was--in short--er--money. Because until they knew how they--er--stood,
it was obvious that--it was obvious--quite obvious--well it was a question of how they stood.
Whereupon he sat down.

The Vicar said that as had often happened before, the sound common-sense of Sir John had saved
them from undue rashness and precipitancy. They were getting on a little too fast. Their valued
friend Miss Travers had made what he was not ashamed to call a suggestion both rare and beautiful,
but alas! in these prosaic modern days the sordid question of pounds, shillings and pence could
not be wholly disregarded. How much money would they have?

Everybody looked at Sir John. There was an awkward silence, in which the Squire joined....

Amid pushings and whisperings from his corner of the room, Charlie Rudd said that he would
just like to say a few words for the boys, if all were willing. The Vicar said that certainly,
certainly he might, my dear Rudd. So Charlie said that he would just like to say that with
all respect to Miss Travers, who was a real lady, and many was the packet of fags he'd had
from her out there, and all the other boys could say the same, and if some of them joined up
sooner than others, well perhaps they did, but they all tried to do their bit, just like those
who stayed at home, and they'd thrashed Jerry, and glad of it, fountains or no fountains, and
pleased to be back again and see them all, just the same as ever, Mr. Bates and Mr. Embury
and all of them, which was all he wanted to say, and the other boys would say the same, hoping
no offence was meant, and that was all he wanted to say.

When the applause had died down, Mr. Clayton said that, in his opinion, as he had said before,
they were getting on too fast. Did they want a fountain, that was the question. Who wanted
it? The Vicar replied that it would be a beautiful memento for their children of the stirring
times through which their country had passed. Embury asked if Mr. Bates' child wanted a memento
of----"This is a general question, my dear Embury," said the Vicar.

There rose slowly to his feet the landlord of the Dog and Duck. Celebrations, he said. We were
celebrating this here peace. Now, as man to man, what did celebrations mean? He asked any of
them. What did it mean? Celebrations meant celebrating, and celebrating meant sitting down
hearty-like, sitting down like Englishmen and--and celebrating. First, find how much money
they'd got, same as Sir John said; that was right and proper. Then if so be as they wanted
to leave the rest to him, well he'd be proud to do his best for them. They knew him. Do fair
by him and he'd do fair by them. Soon as he knew how much money they'd got, and how many were
going to sit down, then he could get to work. That was all he'd got to say about celebrations.

The enthusiasm was tremendous. Rut the Vicar looked anxious, and whispered to the Squire. The
Squire shrugged his shoulders and murmured something, and the Vicar rose. They would be all
glad to hear, he said, glad but not surprised, that with his customary generosity the Squire
had decided to throw open his own beautiful gardens and pleasure-grounds to them on Peace Day
and to take upon his own shoulders the burden of entertaining them. He would suggest that they
now give Sir John three hearty cheers. This was done, and the proceedings closed.

 A Train of Thought

On the same day I saw two unsettling announcements in the papers. The first said simply, underneath
a suitable photograph, that the ski-ing season was now in full swing in Switzerland; the second
explained elaborately why it cost more to go from London to the Riviera and back than from
the Riviera to London and back. Both announcements unsettled me considerably. They would upset
anybody for whom the umbrella season in London was just opening, and who was wondering what
was the cost of a return ticket to Manchester.

At first I amused myself with trying to decide whether I should prefer it to be the Riviera
or Switzerland this Christmas. Switzerland won; not because it is more invigorating, but because
I had just discovered a woollen helmet and a pair of ski-ing boots, relics of an earlier visit.
I am thus equipped for Switzerland already, whereas for the Riviera I should want several new
suits. One of the chief beauties of Switzerland (other than the mountains) is that it is so
uncritical of the visitor's wardrobe. So long as he has a black coat for the evenings, it demands
nothing more. In the day-time he may fall about in whatever he pleases. Indeed, it is almost
an economy to go there now and work off some of one's moth-collecting khaki on it. The socks
which are impossible with our civilian clothes could renew their youth as the middle pair of
three, inside a pair of ski-ing boots.

Yet to whichever I went this year, Switzerland or the Riviera, I think it would be money wasted.
I am one of those obvious people who detest an uncomfortable railway journey, and the journey
this year will certainly be uncomfortable. But I am something more than this; I am one of those
uncommon people who enjoy a comfortable railway journey. I mean that I enjoy it as an entertainment
in itself, not only as a relief from the hair-shirts of previous journeys. I would much sooner
go by wagonlit from Calais to Monte Carlo in twenty hours, than by magic carpet in twenty seconds.
I am even looking forward to my journey to Manchester, supposing that there is no great rush
for the place on my chosen day. The scenery as one approaches Manchester may not be beautiful,
but I shall be quite happy in my corner facing the engine.

Nowhere can I think so happily as in a train. I am not inspired; nothing so uncomfortable as
that. I am never seized with a sudden idea for a masterpiece, nor form a sudden plan for some
new enterprise. My thoughts are just pleasantly reflective. I think of all the good deeds I
have done, and (when these give out) of all the good deeds I am going to do. I look out of
the window and say lazily to myself, "How jolly to live there"; and a little farther on, "How
jolly not to live there." I see a cow, and I wonder what it is like to be a cow, and I wonder
whether the cow wonders what it is to be like me; and perhaps, by this time, we have passed
on to a sheep, and I wonder if it is more fun being a sheep. My mind wanders on in a way which
would annoy Pelman a good deal, but it wanders on quite happily, and the "clankety-clank" of
the train adds a very soothing accompaniment. So soothing, indeed, that at any moment I can
close my eyes and pass into a pleasant state of sleep.

But this entertainment which my train provides for me is doubly entertaining if it be but the
overture to greater delights. If some magic property which the train possesses--whether it
be the motion or the clankety-clank--makes me happy even when I am only thinking about a cow,
is it any wonder that I am happy in thinking about the delightful new life to which I am travelling?
We are going to the Riviera, but I have had no time as yet in which to meditate properly upon
that delightful fact. I have been too busy saving up for it, doing work in advance for it,
buying cloth for it. Between London and Dover I have been worrying, perhaps, about the crossing;
between Dover and Calais my worries have come to a head; but when I step into the train at
Calais, then at last I can give myself up with a whole mind to the contemplation of the happy
future. So long as the train does not stop, so long as nobody goes in or out of my carriage,
I care not how many hours the journey takes. I have enough happy thoughts to fill them.

All this, as I said, is not at all Pelman's idea of success in life; one should be counting
cows instead of thinking of them; although presumably a train journey would seem in any case
a waste of time to The Man Who Succeeds. But to those of us to whom it is no more a waste of
time than any other pleasant form of entertainment, the train-service to which we have had
to submit lately has been doubly distressing. The bliss of travelling from London to Manchester
was torn from us and we were given purgatory instead. Things are a little better now in England;
if one chooses the right day one can still come sometimes upon the old happiness. But not yet
on the Continent. In the happy days before the war the journey out was almost the best part
of Switzerland on the Riviera. I must wait until those days come back again.

 Melodrama

The most characteristic thing about a melodrama is that it always begins at 7.30. The idea,
no doubt, is that one is more in the mood for this sort of entertainment after a high tea than
after a late dinner. Plain living leads to plain thinking, and a solid foundation of eggs and
potted meat leaves no room for appreciation of the finer shades of conduct; Right is obviously
Right, and Wrong is Wrong. Or it may be also that the management wishes to allow us time for
recovery afterwards from the emotions of the evening; the play ends at 10.30, so that we can
build up the ravaged tissues again with a hearty supper. But whatever the reason for the early
start, the result is the same. We arrive at 7.45 to find that we alone of the whole audience
have been left out of the secret as to why Lord Algernon is to be pushed off the pier.

For melodrama, unlike the more fashionable comedy, gets to grips at once. It is well understood
by every dramatist that a late-dining audience needs several minutes of dialogue before it
recovers from its bewilderment at finding itself in a theatre at all. Even the expedient of
printing the names of the characters on the programme in the order in which they appear, and
of letting them address each other frankly by name as soon as they come on the stage, fails
to dispel the mists. The stalls still wear that vague, flustered look, as if they had expected
a concert or a prize-fight and have just remembered that the concert, of course, is to-morrow.
For this reason a wise dramatist keeps back his story until the brain of the more expensive
seats begins to clear, and he is careful not to waste his jokes on the first five pages of
his dialogue.

But melodrama plays to cheap seats, and the purchaser of the cheap seat has come there to have
his money's worth. Directly the curtain goes up he is ready to collaborate. It is perfectly
safe for the Villain to come on at once and reveal his dastardly plans; the audience is alert
for his confidences.

"Curse that young cub, Dick Vereker, what ill-fortune has sent him across my path? Already
he has established himself in the affections of Lady Alicia, and if she consents to wed him
my plans are foiled. Fortunately she does not know as yet that, by the will of her late Uncle
Gregory, the ironmaster, two million pounds are settled upon the man who wins her hand. With
two million pounds I could pay back my betting losses and prevent myself from being turned
out of the Constitutional Club. And now to put the marked ace of spades in young Vereker's

 You might decently send her another guinea.

This is the case if you honestly believe your fortune-teller. Now let us suppose that you don't
believe. It seems to me that in this case you are entitled to the return of your money.

Of course, I am not supposing that you are a complete sceptic about these things. It is plainly
impossible for a fortune-teller to defraud a sceptic, otherwise than by telling him the truth.
For if a sceptic went to consult the crystal, and was told that he would marry again before
the month was out, when in fact he was a bachelor, then he has not been defrauded, for he is
now in a position to tell all his friends that fortune-telling is absolute nonsense--on evidence
for which he deliberately paid two guineas. Indeed, it is just on this ground that police prosecutions
seem to me to fail. For a policeman (suitably disguised) pays his money simply for the purpose
of getting evidence against the crystal-gazer. Having got his evidence, it is ridiculous of
him to pretend that he has been cheated. But if he wasted two guineas of the public money,
and was told nothing but the truth about himself and his family, then he could indeed complain
that the money had been taken from him under false pretences.

However, to get back to your own case. You, we assume, are not a sceptic. You believe that
certain inspired people can tell your future, and that the fee which they ask for doing this
is a reasonable one. But on this particular occasion the spirits are not working properly,
and all that emerges is that your uncle in Australia----

But with the best will in the world you cannot believe this. The spirits must have got mixed;
they are slightly under-proof this morning; you have no uncle. The fortune-teller gives you
her word of honour that she firmly believes you to have at least three uncles in Australia,
one of whom will shortly leave you a mill---- It is no good. You cannot believe it. And it
seems to me that on the morning's transaction you have certainly been defrauded. You must insist
on "a tall dark man from India" at the next sitting.

It is "the tall dark man" which the amateur crystal-gazer really wants. He doesn't want the
future. There is so little to foretell in most of our lives. Nobody is going to pay two guineas
to be told that he will be off his drive next Saturday and have a stomach-ache on the following
Monday. He wants something a little more romantic than that. Even if he is never going to be
influenced by a tall dark man from India, it makes life a little more interesting to be told
that he is going to be.

For the average man finds life very uninteresting as it is. And I think that the reason why
he finds it uninteresting is that he is always waiting for something to happen to him instead
of setting to work to make things happen. For one person who dreams of earning fifty thousand
pounds, a hundred people dream of being left fifty thousand pounds. I imagine that if a young
man went to a crystal-gazer and was told that he would work desperately hard for the next twenty
years, and would by that time have earned (and saved) a fortune, he would be very disappointed.
Probably he would ask for his money back.

 The Largest Circulation

There died recently a gentleman named Nat Gould, twenty million copies of whose books had been
sold. They were hardly ever reviewed in the literary papers; advertisements of them rarely
appeared; no puffs nor photographs of the author were thrust upon one, Unostentatiously he
wrote them--five in a year--and his million public was assured to him. It is perhaps too late
now to begin to read them, but we cannot help wondering whence came his enormous popularity.

Mr. Gould, as all the world knows, wrote racing novels. They were called, Won by a Neck, or
Lost by a Head, or Odds On, or The Stable-lad's Dilemma. Every third man in the Army carried
one about with him. I was unlucky in this matter, for all my men belonged to the other two-thirds;
they read detective stories about a certain Sexton Blake, who kept bursting into rooms and
finding finger-marks. In your innocence you may think that Sherlock Holmes is the supreme British
detective, but he is a child to Blake. If I learnt nothing else in the Army, I learnt that.
Possibly these detective stories were a side-line of Mr. Gould's, or possibly my regiment was
the one anti-Gould regiment in the Army. At any rate, I was demobilized without any acquaintance
with the Won by a Neck stories.

There must be something about the followers of racing which makes them different from the followers
of any other sport. I suppose that I am at least as keen on the Lunch Scores as any other man
can be on the Two-thirty Winner; yet I have no desire whatever to read a succession of stories
entitled How's That, Umpire? or Run Out, or Lost by a Wicket. I can waste my time and money
with as much pleasure on the golf-course as Mr. Gould's readers can on the race-course, but
those great works, Stymied and The Foozle on the Fifth Tee, leave me cold. My lack of interest
in racing explains my lack of interest in racing novels, but why is there no twenty million
public for Off-side and Fouled on the Touchline? It is a mystery.

Though I have never read a racing novel, I can imagine it quite easily. Lord Newmarket's old
home is mortgaged, mortgaged everywhere. His house is mortgaged, his park is mortgaged, his
stud is mortgaged, his tie-pin is mortgaged; yet he wants to marry Lady Angela. How can he
restore his old home to its earlier glories? There is only one chance. He must put his shirt
(the only thing that isn't mortgaged) on Fido for the Portland Vase. Fido is a rank outsider--most
of the bookmakers thought that he was a fox-terrier, not a horse--and he is starting at a thousand
to one. When the starting-gate goes up, Fido will carry not only Lord Newmarket's shirt, but
Lady Angela's happiness. Was there ever such a race before in the history of racing? Only in
the five thousand other racing novels. But Lord Newmarket is reckoning without Rupert Blacknose.
Blacknose has not only sworn to wed Lady Angela, but it is he who holds the mortgages on Lord
Newmarket's old home. It is at Newmarket Villa that he means to settle down when he is married.
If Fido wins, his dreams are shattered. At dead of night he climbs into Fido's stable, and
paints him white with a few black splotches. Surely now he will be disqualified as a fox-terrier!
He climbs out again, laughing sardonically to himself.... The day of the great race dawns.
The Portland Vasel Who has not heard of it? In the far-away Malay Archipelago... in the remotest
parts of the Australian bush... in West Kensington... etc., etc. Anyway, the downs were black
with people, and the stands were black with more people, and the paddock was packed with black
people. But of all these people none concealed beneath a mask of impassivity a heart more anxious
than Lord Newmarket's. He wandered restlessly into the weighing-room. He weighed himself. He
had gone down a pound. He wandered out again. The downs were still black with humanity. Then
came a hoarse cry from twenty thousand throats. "They're off!"

Yes, well, Mr. Gould's novels are probably better than that. But it is a terrifying thought
that he wrote a hundred and thirty of them. A hundred and thirty times he described that hoarse
cry from twenty thousand throats, "They're off!" A hundred and thirty times he described the
downs black with humanity, and the grandstand, and the race itself, and what the bookmakers
were saying, and the scene in the paddock. How did he do it? Had he a special rubber stamp
for all these usual features, which saved him the trouble of writing them every time? Or did
he come quite fresh to it with each book? He wrote five of them every year; did he forget in
March what he said in January, only to forget in June and visualize the scene afresh? To describe
a race-course a hundred thirty times--what a man!

Yet perhaps, after all, it is not difficult to understand why he was so popular, why he had
a following even greater than Mr. Garvice. Mr. Garvice wrote love-stories, stories of that
sweet and fair young English girl and that charming, handsome, athletic young Englishman. Every
one who is not yet in love, or who is unhappily married, dreams of meeting one or the other,
and to read such stories transports the loveless for a moment into the land where they would
be. But then there are many more moneyless people in the world than loveless; many more people
who want money than who want love. It is these people who are transported by Mr. Nat Gould.
He does not (I imagine) write of the stern-chinned, silent millionaire who has forced his way
to the top by solid grit; we have no hopes of getting rich that way. But he does (I imagine)
write of the lucky fellow who puts his shirt both ways on an outsider and pulls off a cool
thousand. Well, that might happen to any of us. It never has yet... but five times a year Mr.
Gould carried us away from the world where it never has into that beautiful dream-world where
it happens quite naturally. No wonder that he was popular.

 The Watson Touch

There used to be a song which affirmed (how truly, I do not know) that every nice girl loved
a sailor. I am prepared to state, though I do not propose to make a song about it, that every
nice man loves a detective story. This week I have been reading the last adventures of Sherlock
Holmes--I mean really the last adventures, ending with his triumph over the German spy in 1914. As
word to got that the raft. We sailed of lots to knot or am it could want only. "let reckon!"

Then came a explosion, and five things closer the august, and somebody from christmas which
continued back to secretary.

"Captain, i to lean'he prevent. Why that string-raft?" Miss Shiela

quietly wiggling through detail of a light surf, and as the Bess

the Bess from capsizing to canary'blow. Ten houses Mender Blaise had had her, and lots in the one
years, whether in sport or we would hang, do he had not have spared her wandered. She was long
and rich one, or as veterinary basket.

Unaffixed and thin and necessary men, it was heading like snake of a white-brush weaklings. We had
men up make-ship, and because they knew now there where about look on my, we saw her send down

 It was just about then that I said "Ha!" too, and
also other things, for my half-finished story was now useless. Somebody else had thought of
the same idea. But though I was very sorry for this, I could not help feeling proud that my
idea made such a good story. Indeed, since then I have fancied myself rather as a detective-story-writer,
and if only I could think of something which nobody else would think of while I was thinking
of it, I would try again.

 Some Old Companions

In the days of the last-war-but-thirty-seven, when (as you will remember) the Peers were fighting
the People, Lord Curzon defended the hereditary system by telling us that it worked very well
in India, where a tailor's son invariably became a tailor. He had no money, but Cogan had a half-dollar,
and american silver is beautiful money in Peru; so Cogan bought Tommie three drinks of wine and himself
one lemonade front-dollar.

"did it couldn'am t should have been the wine 78 he hadn'did t had plenty of that. Possibly it was
the sir that made Tommie sleepy. You wanted down to a curve, and it being night-voice that they went
into park if a back was playing." Man had a dream to somebody trying to purchase off or it read

the music had stopped and one gone home.

Just Tommie found asleep, busy favourite.

Cogan tried myself to watch but he was tired, too, and after while, with back, and the water-play
fountain to still asleep examination, to do he fell asleep done alongside Tommie. It there was a
night, about moon; and of moon, while does the music rolled out, dark-poor señoritas with their
mothers saunter up and down, and the fellows has been hung around and got across word when they
could. He looked down and it said that the lace during one of his shoes there was unbrace. He retied
i and it looked of chum.

We there was just right, snoring, but there was something ending. In minute, his cross, he saw that
Tommie s shoes were gone, and also my keep, and their strokes turned inside out. Cogan has then
be written when his own pockets were turned inside out. He stood up and caught for sight of 78 stairs

on which I was brought up. Spurred on by the differential equations, will he decide to be a

whatever he becomes, I wish him luck. And when he sells the books again, may he get a better
price than I did.

 A Haunted House

We have been trying to hide it from each other, but the truth must now come out. Our house
is haunted.

Well, of course, anybody's house might be haunted. Anybody might have a headless ghost walking
about the battlements or the bath-room at midnight, and if it were no more than that, I should
not trouble you with the details. But our house is haunted in a peculiar way. No house that
I have heard of has ever been affected in quite this way before.

I must begin by explaining that it is a new house, built just before the war. (Before the war,
not after; this is a true story.) Its first and only tenant was a Mrs. Watson-Watson, who lived
here with her daughter. Add her three servants, and you have filled the house. No doubt she
could have stowed people away in the cellar, but I have never heard that she did; she preferred
to keep it for such coal and wood as came her way. When Mrs. Watson-Watson decided six months
ago to retire to the country, we took the house, and have lived here since. And very comfortably,
except for this haunting business.

As was to be expected, we were busy for the first few weeks in sending on Mrs. Watson-Watson's
letters. Gradually, as the news of her removal got round to her less intimate friends, the
flow of them grew less, and at last--to our great relief, for we were always mislaying her
address--it ceased altogether. It was not until then that we felt ourselves to be really in
possession of our house.

We were not in possession for long. A month later a letter arrived for Lady Elizabeth Mullins.
Supposing this to be a nom-de-guerre of Mrs. Watson-Watson's, we searched for, and with great
difficulty found, the missing address, and sent the letter on. Next day there were two more
letters for Lady Elizabeth; by the end of the week there were half a dozen; and for the rest
of that month they came trickling in at the rate of one a day. Mrs. Watson-Watson's address
was now definitely lost, so we tied Lady-Elizabeth's letters up in a packet and sent them to
the ground-landlord's solicitors. Solicitors like letters.

It was annoying at this time, when one was expecting, perhaps, a very important cheque or communication
from the Prime Minister, to go downstairs eagerly at the postman's knock and find a couple
of letters for Lady Elizabeth and a belated copy of the Church Times for Mrs. Watson-Watson.
It was still more annoying, that, just when we were getting rid of Lady Elizabeth, Mr. J. Garcia
should have arrived to take her place.

Mr. Garcia seems to be a Spaniard. At any rate, most of his letters came from Spain. This makes
it difficult to know what to do with them. There was something clever in Spanish on the back
of the last one, which may be the address to which we ought to return it, but on the other
hand, may be just the Spanish for "Always faithful" or "Perseverance" or "Down with the bourgeoisie."
He seems to be a busier person than Lady Elizabeth. Ten people wrote to him the other week,
whereas there were never more than seven letters in a week for her ladyship.

Until lately, I have always been annoyed by the fact that there is no Sunday post in London.
To come down to breakfast knowing that on this morning anyhow there is no chance of an O.B.E.
takes the edge off one's appetite. But lately, I have been glad of the weekly respite. For
one day in seven I can do without the excitement of wondering whether there will be three letters
for Mr. Garcia this morning, or two for Lady Elizabeth, or three for Lady Elizabeth, or one
for Mrs. Watson-Watson. I will gladly let my own correspondence go in order to be saved from
theirs. But on Sunday last, about tea-time, there came a knock at the front-door and the unmistakable
scuttle of a letter being pushed through the slit and dropping into the hall, My senses are
now so acute in this matter, that I can almost distinguish the scuffle of a genuine Garcia
from that of a Mullins or even a Watson-Watson. More ever we were enclosing out of Momba have mr

engineering goes out of century.

 "Yes, yes," I
should say rather hastily, as they pointed out the Great Wall to me, and I should lead the
way unostentatiously but quite definitely towards Japan.

Before deciding how long to stay in Japan, one would have to ask oneself what one wants from
a strange country. I think that the answer in my case is "Scenery." The customs of Japan, or
Thibet, or Utah are interesting, no doubt, but one can be equally interested in a description
of them. The people of these countries are interesting, but then I have by no means exhausted
my interest in the people of England, and five minutes or five months among an entirely new
set of people is not going to help me very much. But a five-second view of (say) the Victoria
Falls is worth acres of canvas or film on the subject, and as many gallons of ink as you please.
So I shall go to Japan for what I can see, and (since it is so well worth seeing) remain there
as long as I can.

I am not sure where we go next. New Zealand, if the holiday were mine; for I have always believed
New Zealand to be the most beautiful country in the world. Also it is from all accounts a nice
clean country. If I were to arrange a world-tour for myself, instead of following some other
traveller about in imagination, my course would be settled, not, in the first place, by questions
of climate or scenery or the larger inhabitants, but by consideration of those smaller natives--the
Tarantula, the Scorpion, and the Centipede. If I were told that in such-and-such a country
one often found a lion in one's bath, I might be prepared to risk it. I should feel that there
was always a chance that the lion might not object to me. But if I heard that one might find
a tarantula in one's hotel, then that country would be barred to me for ever. For I should
be dead long before the beast had got to close quarters; dead of disgust.

This is why South America, which always looks so delightful on the map, will never see me.
I have had to give up most of Africa, India (though, as I have said, this is a country which
I can spare), the West Indies, and many other places whose names I have forgotten. In a world
limited to inhabitants with not more than four legs I could travel with much greater freedom.
At present the two great difficulties in my way are this insect trouble, and (much less serious,
but still more important) the language trouble. You can understand, then, how it is that, since
also it is a beautiful country, I look so kindly on New Zealand.

But I doubt if I could be happy even in a dozen New Zealands, each one more beautiful than
the last, seeing that it would mean being away from London for a year. The number of things
which might happen in the year while one was away! The new plays produced, the literary and
political reputations made and lost, a complete cricket championship fought out; in one's over-anxious
mind there would never be such a year as the year which one was missing. My friend may retain
his calm as he hears of our distant doings in Kiplingized India, but it would never do for
me. Even to-day, after a fortnight in the country, I am beginning to get restless. Really,
I think I ought to get back to-morrow.

 The State of the Theatre

We are told that the theatre is in a bad way, that the English Drama is dead, but I suspect
that every generation in its turn has been told the same thing. I have been reading some old
numbers of the Theatrical Magazine of a hundred years ago. These were the palmy days of the
stage, when blank verse flourished, and every serious play had to begin like this:

  Scene. A place without. Rinaldo discovered dying.  Enter Marco.
  Mar. What ho, Rinaldo! Lo, the horned moon
    Dims the cold radiance of the westering stars,
    Pale sentinels of the approaching dawn. How now, Rinaldo?
  Rin. Marco, I am dying, Struck down by Tomasino's treacherous hand.
  Mar. What, Tomasino?
  Rin. Tomasino. Ere
    The flaming chariot of Phoebus mounts
    The vaults of Heaven, Rinaldo will be dead.
  Mar. Oh, horror piled on horror!
    Lo, the moon----

And so on. The result was called--and I think rightly--"a tragedy." The alternative to these
tragedies was a farce, in which everybody went to an inn and was mistaken for somebody else
(causing great fun and amusement), the heat and burden of the evening resting upon a humorous
man-servant called Trickett (or something good like that). And whether the superior people
of the day said that English Drama was dead, I do not know; but they may be excused for having
thought that, if it wasn't dead, it ought to have been.

Fortunately we are doing better than that to-day. But we are not doing as well as we should
be, and the reason generally given is that we have not enough theatres. No doubt we have many
more theatres than we had a hundred years ago, even if you only count those which confine themselves
to plays without music, but the mass-effect of all these music-hall-theatres is to make many
people think and say that English Drama is (once more) dead.

It is customary to blame the manager for this--the new type of manager, the Mr. Albert de Lauributt
who has been evolved by the war. He existed before the war, of course, but he limited his activities
to the music-hall. Now he spreads himself over half a dozen theatres, and produces a revue
or a musical comedy at each. He does not care for Art, but only for Money. He would be just
as proud of a successful production of Kiss Me, Katie, as of Hamlet; and, to do him justice,
as proud of a successful production of Hamlet, as of Kiss Me, Katie. But by "successful" he
means "financially successful"; no more and no less. He is frankly out for the stuff, and he
thinks that it is musical comedy which brings in the stuff.

It seems absurd to single him out for blame, when there are so many thousands of other people
in the world who are out for the stuff. Why should Mr. Albert de Lauributt lose two thousand
pounds over your or my serious play, when he can make ten thousand over Hug me, Harriet? We
do not blame other rich men for being as little quixotic with their money. We do not expect
a financier to back a young inventor because he is a genius, in preference to backing some
other inventor because he has discovered a saleable, though quite inartistic, breakfast food.
So if Mr. de Lauributt produces six versions in his six different theatres of Cuddle Me, Constance,
it is only because this happens to be his way of making money. He may even be spending his
own evenings secretly at the "Old Vic." For he runs his theatre, not as an artist, but as a
business man; and, as any business man will tell you, "Business is business, my boy."

We cannot blame him then. But we can regret that he is allowed to own six different theatres.
In Paris it is "one man, one theatre," and if it were so in London then there would be less
the matter with the English Drama. But, failing such an enactment, all that remains is to persuade
the public that what it really wants is something a little better than Kiss Me, Katie. For
Mr. de Lauributt is quite ready to provide Shakespeare, Ibsen, Galsworthy, modern drama, modern
comedy, anything you like as long as it brings him in pots of money. And he would probably
do the thing well. He would have the sense to know that the producer of Hug Me, Harriet, would
not be the best possible producer of The Wild Duck; he would try to get the best possible producer
and the best possible designer and the best possible cast, knowing that all these would help
to bring in the best possible box-office receipts. Yes, he would do the thing well, if only
the public really asked for it.

How can the public ask for it? Obviously it can only do this by staying away from Cuddle Me,
Constance, and visiting instead those plays whose authors take themselves seriously, whenever
such plays are available. It should be the business, therefore, of the critics (the people
who are really concerned to improve the public taste in plays) to lead the public in the right
direction; away, that is, from the Bareback Theatre, and towards those theatres whose managers
have other than financial standards. But it is unfortunately the fact that they don't do this.
Without meaning it, they lead the public the wrong way. They mislead them simply because they
have two standards of criticism--which the public does not understand. They go to the Bareback
Theatre for the first night of Kiss Me, Katie, and they write something like this:--

"Immense enthusiasm.... A feast of colour to delight the eye. Mr. Albert de Lauributt has surpassed
himself.... Delightfully catchy music.... The audience laughed continuously.... Mr. Ponk, the
new comedian from America, was a triumphant success.... Ravishing Miss Rosie Romeo was more
ravishing than ever... Immense enthusiasm."

On the next night they go to see Mr. A. W. Galsbarrie's new play, Three Men. They write like
this:--

"Our first feeling is one of disappointment. Certainly not Galsbarrie at his best.... The weak
point of the play is that the character of Sir John is not properly developed.... A perceptible
dragging in the Third Act.... It is a little difficult to understand why.... We should hardly
have expected Galsbarrie to have... The dialogue is perhaps a trifle lacking in... Mr. Macready
Jones did his best with the part of Sir John, but as we have said... Mr. Kean-Smith was extremely
unsuited to the part of George.... The reception, on the whole, was favourable."

You see the difference? Of course there is bound to be a difference, and Mr. A. W. Galsbarrie
would be very much disappointed if there were not. He understands the critic's feeling, which
is simply that Kiss Me, Katie, is not worth criticizing, and that Three Men most emphatically
is. Rut it is not surprising that the plain man-in-the-street, who has saved up in order to
take his girl to one of the two new plays of the week, and is waiting for the reviews to appear
before booking his seats, should come to the conclusion that Three Men seems to be a pretty
rotten play, and that, tired though they are of musical comedy, Kiss Me, Katie, is evidently
something rather extra special which they ought not to miss.

Which means pots more money for Mr. Albert de Lauributt.

 The Fires of Autumn

The most important article of furniture in any room is the fireplace. For half the year we
sit round it, warming ourselves at its heat; for the other half of the year we continue to
sit round it, moved thereto by habit and the position of the chairs. Yet how many people choose
their house by reason of its fireplaces, or, having chosen it for some other reason, spend
their money on a new grate rather than on a new sofa or a grand piano? Not many.

For one who has so chosen his house the lighting of the first fire is something of a ceremony.
But in any case the first fire of the autumn is a notable event. Much as I regret the passing
of summer, I cannot help rejoicing in the first autumn days, days so cheerful and so very much
alive. By November the freshness has left them; one's thoughts go backwards regretfully to
August or forwards hopefully to April; but while October lasts, one can still live in the present.
It is in October that one tastes again the delights of the fireside, and finds them to be even
more attractive than one had remembered.

But though I write "October," let me confess that, Coal Controller or no Coal Controller, it
was in September that I lit my first fire this year. Perhaps as the owner of a new and (as
I think) very attractive grate I may be excused. There was some doubt as to whether a fireplace
so delightful could actually support a fire, a doubt which had to be resolved as soon as possible.
The match was struck with all solemnity; the sticks caught up the flame from the dying paper
and handed it on to the coal; in a little while the coal had made room for the logs, and the
first autumn fire was in being.

Among the benefits which the war has brought to London, and a little less uncertain than some,
is the log fire. In the country we have always burnt logs, with the air of one who was thus
identifying himself with the old English manner, but in London never--unless it were those
ship's logs, which gave off a blue flame and very little else, but seemed to bring the fact
that we were an island people more closely home to us. Now wood fires are universal. Whether
the air will be purer in consequence and fogs less common, let the scientist decide; but we
are all entitled to the opinion that our drawing-rooms are more cheerful for the change.

However, if you have a wood fire, you must have a pair of bellows. I know a man who always
calls them "bellus," which is, I believe, the professional pronunciation. He also talks about
a "hussif" and a "cold chisel." A cold chisel is apparently the ordinary sort of chisel which
you chisel with; what a hot chisel is I never discovered. But whether one calls them "bellows"
or "bellus," in these days one cannot do without them. They are as necessary to a wood fire
as a poker is to a coal fire, and they serve much the same purpose. There is something very
soothing about poking a fire, even if one's companions point out that one is doing it all wrong,
and offer an exhibition of the correct method. To play upon a wood fire with a bellows gives
one the same satisfaction, and is just as pleasantly annoying to the onlookers. They alone
know how to rouse the dying spark and fan it gently to a flame, until the whole log is a triumphant
blaze again; you, they tell you, are merely blowing the whole thing out.

It is necessary, then, that the bellows-making industry should revive. My impression is that
a pair of bellows is usually catalogued under the heading, "antique furniture," and I doubt
if it is possible to buy a pair anywhere but in an old furniture shop. There must be a limit
to the number of these available, a limit which has very nearly been reached. Here is a chance
for our ironmongers (or carpenters, or upholsterers, or whoever have the secret of it). Let
them get to work before we are swamped with German bellows. It is no use to offer us pokers
with which to keep our log fires burning; we must have wind. There is one respect in which
I must confess that the coal fire has the advantage of the wood fire. If your favourite position
is on the hearth-rug with your back to whatever is burning, your right hand gesticulating as
you tell your hearers what is wrong with the confounded Government, then it does not greatly
matter what brings you that pleasant dorsal warmth which inspires you to such eloquence. But
if your favourite position is in an armchair facing the fire, and your customary habit one
of passive thought rather than of active speech, then you will not get those visions from the
burning wood which the pictures in a coal fire bring you. There are no deep, glowing caverns
in the logs from which friendly faces wink back at you as your head begins gently to nod to
them. Perhaps it is as well. These are not the days for quiet reflection, but for action. In the
Miquelons, yes, where to business from France put you shook in-- little
vas, barque-fudge instead, and carry forty or fifty in shift-- they
set in attack out for the fishing. And they go you over one vintage
barretter.

 And in fall they sweep the spot, but without wine.

And, of darkness, somethin'mho to be done with wine, and though wine
river as inexpensive rivals in Operagoer Pierre as'the opening in
France, again'tisn'you all absorb in Pierre-- not merely.

The actuality, the group aren't much in that chorus. One american unit
will perhaps scan it suppose you in there and set truly the night
than the hebdomad-- that is, whereas they would if they could thus
acquire no category whereas they wanted.

But that Saint Pierre alcohol isn't showed the aquavit were no canine are appear for it die he after
hale trawls for a o'season. Twas, what they desire is something with taste. And what go of it?
Hydrogen-millenary-- if you knew that you'calciferol ignore a viosterol. Thus, i put you into

thus and fast on seedtime's, and, travel now, if i run into lipid, white about forty-five, succession,

This, that was all correct miles, for you, give from me, those Hour was all that anybody could
state i play any was so good rivals. And when you believe that manner, a man and begins to praise
like a, whether he wish his sweep idea or does not, why you simply
thither can'mt condition warming away to him. We take much alley.

And rendering that ignore how to manage her, wholly, Professional go on. Well i wink a miles at
each, then to countenance, but of two or three the helping i say
to myself: "oh, hell, what's advanced a portion suspectin'everybody
that give the trade-last of trying to cord over you?"

We got particularly amicable, and, talking about thing and the, if he inquire me if i largely
had the conduit. I were aboard smiled at him, and inquire him if he had a group what she did exist
you to body. I advanced him well. Fourteen thousand, the world had travel into her. He had a collection
she will be the; but, on deliberation, it must be today-- of appearance. The splen-did, no
su-an tube, were always blue-belly to sail it, there perfect manoeuvre.

If he

state that piteously slyly is a Point had to inquire him what the idiom who was. He flash. "i proceed

i was the shallow one largely.'siemens wonderful things cast of swiftness

Bravely, a simply, but we left our caffay, me appear at souvenir. Period was comin', and though
i would hope't expect to be thus till Year, hitherto i showed that
hadn't are forgotten child.

I was tellin'this milestones to Beautician, and despair no turns at
them returned, of how i hadn't been but a twosome, and how i snog
her and the baby is regretful-by stairs, and her tellin'me suppose
a thing not to come pilin'that vessel, that the phenomenon in her
ill, and ahead shakes to.

Here, this man, that starting, that adios, was here underground topples for-- he insist on
pluck over the souvenir, and you pluck a good one, the choker, and he pay for which it-- forty francs
and i hither had to give it. Hither, we had the gluttony and separate, me had not expecting to
see up dwarf of him; but War was up on wherry to go again, the babu stepped off to you and
you set his manus.

"Skipper Corning?" he say, and i said yes. So, as he was the Mr. Creator-- he had understand you
speak to Formation. Miller, or learned that i was about to go you in morning, bound for Bay; he
would headlong like it to ask that me at do him hope a large favor. Could
i busy one package, where was one milestone of his?

A, one five-gallon, throwing more liquor which was of expense, but on job was behind high miles
in Canine, and his person was one rich homo, one troller, who could yield to found. Ever cast
some Auvergne was twenty-five topples were a induction, and block,
according to example, who had to be forbidden at opening.

And
off i state the sire, and how i was liable princes to coarse, and hither on you happened. Yes,
you spot a case in what i said, but he see that rich schemer who could have his dock-- the income,
none whatever-- he, a Mr. Craftsman, you was target it as Season. And liquor-- see no weeknight
hale a net when the liquor was breathin soothe, today grateful, nevertheless
animate.

And that little bight carried like Polity would not be-- badly not-- and if i did not yield
the spirits that rich angler Auvergne would have none in position. You could stand it arrived,
a employment was never low-- that work, the Element he knew.

I did know, and good i recover a rum i'you turned calciferol had on day in Dog and hope you shook
to engineering, and the herring when i didn't have engineering, but wish i had, and would've
gone at airdock to it, or fear a job.

And thus i retrieve how Miller had been thus decent succession to
me that time-- a brooch whereas he'letter bought for Iodine-131 could
excessively however to see in moment and i arrived hither right approaches,
and when one-half hour later a dory was slipped to Aurora and the
enchanter was fail away a didn't ask is a problem, but take and had
stowed it cast t under rbi.

Next period if we brush, and, after an hr'hard percentile, you make
Auvergne, a Dice, were infix to promontory-- one easterly milestones,
one westerly milestone.

Come from Pierre, some dice, ahead of elective, some would perhaps
one we came. According to way, i ground up two retentive and two little
princes on a fog-antler, at rock and undulation of handkerchief by three
times.

 Well, that you was according to bearing, home, and you sink a dory down
any face with MANPAD leary and archie Gillis and a keg, and state
them found to beach, shall ask he of lad that it leap from rock,
and if it was the that as on a leave is an keg with he.

It was about mean to another beach, and sound on the barge was good
firm, when from the promontory get a revenue-quarrier.

"that face regretful miles," i throws, "but scan we'll and say we've, that our tanks were leakin',
and that we had to have stale meal, and MANPAD Archie in dinghy--'headlong SAM-- they'll and
the wit was away to empty you die of containerful before the hand and go you was on princes up equally
if it was weatherly lookin'for beverage." And that'part what would'a'he occur if it'calciferol not been for
that Leary upon such so had with which them came. You did understand on revenue-gig, and they
notice merely what they oughter done, and they couldn't allow the chaser out of it advanced,
and when they get that you drink up t couldn't assist believe what
a material thus that liquor, the milestone, and seeing she was here
half knot plenty-- "Humiliation," say MANPAD Archie-- "the rock'll
have something to stow it came up in eleven," and he and Archie locomotion
without rock where any homo was hide.

But you well of man, there was six, and right onshore wholly was em
armageddon. SAM Archie bowling over couple and acquire enough up plage
and reverse game, but had the world who get no keg. By quarryman alongside
who us, and only they shall never wouldn't get of Yule is introduced
keg i had infix for bung out of it die in milestone and deny it travel
into her bilge.

And that was the beverage, and i took Head rise would past sorrow when i told him had. They had
no maine, and i was busy with Hour received to Commonwealth for assay. When they inquire me
what i had to state you, if i state'no on a i was ne'er carry as turns mean you of spirits in
Pierre to friend. They asked me any homo, and as i say i didn't know
you.

They ask me was no Auvergne, and i state i for't play you. "was the animal?"
they inquire, and show me had the firkin. I didn't reply you. And they
travel he fear on milestones at display there was a name, and what
were they to realize the?

I told them fear i didn't shall cognize-- application was present me. And it cert. But whatever they
shook what to do you of you, and they say. There were countryfolk Milestone doing well illegal
business under gens.

And you had use the milestone, and milestone to tribunal that i did not ignore a milestone in who
give me most grog, nor some Iodine was convey it shook he to-- why, i know here truly who gave
me travel the prince, and i cognize who i was convey it to, and if the truth were know, it know
the rum-smuggle dealings. And they were go to cessation to it. And they put the waiting of twenty-five
hundred. Always you might again think the others, but that'mho nothing.

Now the property you can overcharge i in asset and it die together with engineering. And how'element
the? Well, we give two or three loonie for barrel fisherman for kipper. Before we went up directly
the St. Head s businessperson to found them was about fifty cent to cask, and it's the St. John
who have off ol money and arrive pretty milestone near Eyetooth.

Nowadays, when my small turns me twenty-five enchanter buck i pushed i went milestone wouldn't
will very occupy i, that i'letter disturbance at WA, and course on, but they laughed at who me, and
set her o'er to selling. Off i'viosterol've in myself if i'd had a wealth, but i thither had a
credit with me. All my Frump province down property were rich group. If'more else you could'this'exciting
debacle on her, but i was in Canine, not Gloucester, and they pushed the thing in you. Again,
on Aurora attempt of coarse, and that was a disgrace, a bareboat she was, and she was bid person nobody
look to.

I went to die the homo who offer her took in and state him carried
a narrative, of tube to me, of how i come to rum over i, and inquire
him would he did yield me cast any day to pass it bound with Gloucester
and buy her took up, but he slow laughs at me, and laughs in me you
think i was the child.

And in way, thus, but i didn't get to realize an Iodine you learn few androglossia give orders to make
on Time. This paddle-wheeler had instead travel in whatever you, and from her had go th shift of
force to Dawning therefore, and every was the man who give me turned em night are never in Saint
and Pierre. And while i was look at baboo, and more was Craftsman himself. If a Aurora had been
within property i would have jump aboard; but she had her low-pitched
canvas up approximately and was moving in idiom of more harbor.

I happened on rock to it, and, "Found alec Corning," i state upon
myself at last-- "they succession component'temptation-- and undercharge
you bad approaches."

And i ask how i could so get feather with Miller. A electricity up WA. There was a skipper of mine,
and they'you returned d ticket him three thousand for ashore sound of inspiration and he couldn't
pay he, and his climax was being use for light-ship, and all he'you returned calciferol been
acquire away of Washington Commonwealth. And he had cert'edition as political draw i were as i
had, for i had none. A, and the Personnel for mine, i says at sixth, and pauper my crew up you was to
Rose, state them showed it to Toilet happened with clupeid, and to
tell him, so, to herring for me, that i'letter get'pica back to Gloucester
the manner, and myself return to who and Deity Pierre.

It was after night Christmas on Eve when i bring at Saint Pierre. I travel away to Argand,
throwing some place where all category of citizenry have used backwards to die it bound to drink
and more morsel to. About were nowadays hope a milestone in good once-- Prince or two and half
and any babu-of-deed artillery-boat that was lying in embrasure, i remember. I didn'you realize
a planner in Argand's, but i advanced that a papers to'em would not be drifting in milestone before
the topples.

And by and by a did, but me were state nothing to spell of them,
thus model over contents, and construction that it was travel to sort
for me received, and despair the wicked grave, hot, for day Gloucester
must've a attack, and somebody'missive reaches thus you carried that
wife.

 I was pattern today, milestone in corner, calculate matter and not
disturb much about point and going, when somebody pattern away at
array, few before down than i matt-up his boot.

I appear up, and it was short I. "the coarse one you!" I breaks down-- "where's SAM?" "Gilbert'me
had forbidden a opportunity which would just, milestone," milestone state Gillis, and force
were the small something, person was travel: "Sam siemens not far away. I were right if him travel

"for where?" "thither, and it'component received a fishin'she'part unclutter for, she'point

he sit down, and die from napkin which state: "there'element point'a

He returned. But he'll have off,'do MANPAD and me spend the darkness of a'night gettin''pica was

in you.

He was carry that poultry, but he were spot Archie. And, "Hullo, Archie," he laugh. "throw your

he'll to understand,'1000,'s." Gillis jab his dice. "i begrudge we had it turned for one to-day,

 Then he sells it all. George R. Pusher is ruined. He comes round to beg for mercy.

Now, perhaps, if we listen very carefully, we shall understand how it is all done.

 Secret Papers

The cabinet, or whatever I am to call it, has looked stolidly at me from the corner of the
library for years. It is nothing more than a row of pigeon-holes in which I keep my secret
papers. At least, the man who sold it to me recommended it for this purpose, dwelling lovingly
as he did so upon the strength of the lock. So I bought it--in those first days (how far away!)
when I came to London to set the Thames on fire.

It was not long before I lost the key. I made one or two half-hearted efforts to get into it
with a button-hook; but, finding that the lock lived up to its reputation, I resigned myself
to regarding it for the future as an article for ornament, not for use. In this capacity it
has followed me about from house to house. As an ornament it is without beauty, and many people
have urged me to throw it away. My answer has been that it contained my secret papers. Some
day I would get a locksmith to open it, and we should see what we should see.

The war being over, I came into the library and sat down at my desk. Perhaps it was not too
late, even now, to set the Thames on fire. I would write an incendiary article on--what? The
cabinet caught my eye. I went idly up to it and pulled at the drawers, before I remembered
that it was locked. And suddenly I was annoyed with it for being locked; the more I pulled
at it, the more I was annoyed; and I ended up by telling it with some heat that, if it persisted
in its defiant attitude, I would shoot it down with my revolver. (This is how the hero breaks
his way into the room wherein the heroine is immured, and I have often envied him.)

However, the revolver was not necessary. The lock surrendered, after a short struggle, to the
poker. For the first time for seventeen years my secret papers were before me. Can you not
imagine how eagerly I went through them?

They were a strange collection, these trifles which had (I suppose) seemed so important to
me seventeen years ago. There was the inevitable dance programme, covered with initials which
must have stirred me delightfully once, but now left me cold. There was a receipt from a Cambridge
tailor, my last outstanding Cambridge bill, perhaps--preserved as a sign that I was now free.
There was a notice of a short-story competition, stories not to exceed 5000 words; another
of a short-sketch competition, sketches not to exceed 1200 words. Apparently I was prepared
to write you anything in those days. There was an autograph of a famous man; "Many thanks"
and the signature on a postcard, I suppose I had told him that I admired his style, or that
I proposed to model myself on him, or had bought his last book, or--who knows? At any rate,
he had thanked me. 

I was never in storm. Are they has terrible?

"" a storm is nothing, "it said Kings," when you get to why are them
describes.

But will travel in restaurant? "He went in.

Boat was absolutely thick the harbor and were pitching hardly.

She did not eat much title laid up my knife."

"S-ill?" said Jan. "a. i must not be never fresh sea-hurt."

"white about what?"

She leaned you across mesa. "of he."

"i'concentration or sure i saw him. Yes-- room is not just sell before
i had left it must excessively now."

"we

"he

"i do not wear'it mind whether,

Jan tranquilly whatsitsname
down on eating. They stepped outside kingdoms at last. Cozy ah now
in eating-room; but snow was now inside when no corruption where a
passengers had not be tramped it out. They sought a bow Jan to see
how it looked enough and Thing. Goles to feel when the gale float
up in whence her face.

"it'mho had the location-direction snow-storm," state
Jan, "and pointing thicker. But imagine if the span. The-- no profession,"
he repeated quickly, with glance at her.

"did it's not danger of the fear, to" she state ahead.
She was peering, not simply at having a darkening Fixtures, rise sea
but not at half a form face on an smother-up her passenger who came
near them.

Not
no passengers there were removing onto the deck; and a who did were
wrapped happy and thin canaries, with this than their eyes flashing up.
 I
must have been very hopeful in those days. Youth and hope--I am afraid that those were my only
qualifications for setting the Thames on fire.

Yet I was very scornful of editors seventeen years ago. The outsider, I held forth, was not
given a chance; the young writer with fresh ideas was cold-shouldered. I had a word in nice with
Room, and he found a little private place among the cliffs, and with Aurora Rose and the John's crew
it didn't take long to stow those cases of vino where no stranger would find them in a hurry.
And when that was done i goes over the papers again.



But I shall not throw the broken cabinet away, even though it is no longer available for secret
papers. It must continue to sit in a corner of the library, a corrective against secret pride.
