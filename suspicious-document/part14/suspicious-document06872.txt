"I'm not so sure," she answered, gravely.  "Of course, I know nothing about Germany.  But I
do know something about our own people.  I know how selfish and individualistic and sordid
and money-grabbing we have been; how slothful and incompetent and self-satisfied we have been,
and I fear it will take a long war and sacrifices and tragedies altogether beyond our present
imagination to make us unselfish and public-spirited and clean and generous; it will take the
strain and emergency of war to make us vigorous and efficient; it will take the sting of many
defeats to impose that humility which will be the beginning of our regeneration.  I am not
worrying about the defeat of Germany.  If our civilization is better than that of Germany we
shall win, ultimately, and if our civilization is worse than that of Germany we shall be defeated,
ultimately,--and we shall deserve to be defeated.  But I rather think that neither of these
alternatives will be the result.  I rather think that the test of war will show that there
are elements in German civilization which are better than ours, and elements in our civilization
which are better than theirs, and that the good elements will survive and form the basis of
a new civilization better than either."

"If that is so," Dave replied, "if this war is but the working out of immutable law which proposes
to put all the elements of civilization to the supreme test and retain only those which are
justifiable by that test, why should I--or any one else--fight?  And," he added as an after-thought,
"what about that principle of forgiveness?"

"We must fight," she answered, "because it is the law that we must fight; because it is only
by fighting that we can justify the principles for which we fight.  If we hold our principles
as being not worth fighting for the new civilization will throw those principles in the discard.
And that, too, covers the question of forgiveness. Forgiveness, in fact, does not enter into
the consideration at all.  We must fight, not because we hate Germany, but because we love
certain principles which Germany is endeavouring to overthrow.  The impulse must be love, not
hate."

She had turned and faced him while she spoke, and he felt himself strangely carried away by
the earnestness and fervour of her argument. What a wonderful woman she was!  How she had stripped
the issue of the detail and circumstance which was confusing even statesmen, and laid it before
him in positive terms which he could find no argument to dispute!  And how in his hour of distress,
when he stood on the verge of utter recklessness and indifference, she had infused into him
a strange and new ambition--an ambition which deepened and enriched every phase of life, and
yet which held life itself less worthy than its own attainment!  And as he looked at her he
again thought of Irene, and suddenly he felt himself engulfed in a great tenderness, and he
knew that even yet----

"What am I to do?" he said.  "I am willing to accept your philosophy. I admit that mine has
broken down, and I am willing to try yours.  What am I to do?"

In the darkness of her own shadow she set her teeth for that answer. It was to be the crowning
act of her self-renunciation, and it strained every fibre of her resolution.  She could not
allow him to stay where he was, even in uniform.  The danger was two-fold.  In a moment of
weakness he would probably shoot Conward, and in a moment of weakness she would probably disclose
her love.  And if Dave should ever marry her he must win her first.

"You had better go overseas and enlist in England," she told him calmly, although her nails
were biting her palms.  "You will get quicker action that way.  And when you come back you
must see Irene, and you must learn from your own heart whether you really loved her or not.
And if you find you did not, then--then you will be free to--to--to think of some other woman."

"I am afraid I shall never care to think of any other woman," he answered.  "Except you.  But
some way you're different.  I don't think of you as a woman, you know; not really, in a way.
I can't explain it, Edith, but you're something more--something better than all that."

"I assure you I am very much a woman--"

But he had sprung to his feet.  "Edith, I can never thank you enough for what you have said
to me to-night.  You have put some spirit back into my body.  I am going to follow your advice.

  Not just now, perhaps, but soon, when the shock of her
interrupted passion turned her to him for companionship.

She stood before him, flushed and vibrating, and with flashing eyes. "You're lying, Conward,"
she said, deliberately.  "First you lied to him and now you lie to me.  There can be no other
explanation.  Where is that gun?  He said I would know what to do with it."

"I have it," said Conward, partly carried off his feet by her violence. "I will keep it until
you are a little more reasonable, and, perhaps, a little more respectful."

"Irene," said Mrs. Hardy, sharply, "what way is that to speak to Mr. Conward?  You are out
of your head, child.  Such a scene, Mr. Conward. Such a scene in my house!  That cow puncher!
I always knew it would come out some time.  It is breeding that tells, Mr. Conward.  Oh, if
the papers should learn of this!"

"That's all you think of," Irene retorted.  "A scene, and the papers. You don't trouble to
even wonder what was the occasion of the scene. You and this--this biped, are at the bottom
of it.  You have been planning to force me along a course I will not go, and you have done
something, something horrible--I don't know what--to cause Dave to act as he did.  But I'm
going to know.  I'm going to find out.  You're afraid of the papers.  I'm not.  I'll give the
whole story to them to-morrow.  I'll tell that you insulted him, Conward, and how you stood
there, a grinning, gaping coward under the muzzle of his gun.  How I wish I had a photograph
of it," she exclaimed, with a little hysterical laugh.  "It would look fine on the front page."
She broke into peals of laughter and rushed up the stairs.

In the morning she was very sober and pale, and marks of distress and sleeplessness were furrowed
in her face.  She greeted her mother with cold civility, and left her breakfast untouched.
She gave part of her morning to Charlie; it was saving balm to her to have some one upon whom
she could pour affection.  Then she went to the telephone.  She called Dave's office; nothing
was known of Mr. Elden; he had been working there last night; he was not down yet.  She called
his apartments; there was no answer.  Then, with a bright thought, she called the garage. 
Mr. Elden's car was out; had not been in at all during the night.  Then she tried a new number.

"Hello, is that the office of The Call?  Will you let me speak to----"

Her mother interrupted almost frantically.  "Irene, you are not going to tell the papers? 
You mustn't do that.  Think of what it means--the disgrace--a shooting affair, almost, in our
home.  Think of me, your mother----"

"I'll think of you on one consideration--that you explain what happened last night, and tell
me where Dave Elden is."

"I can't explain.  I don't know.  And I don't know----"

"And you don't want to know.  And you don't care, so long as you can keep it out of the papers.
I do.  I'm going to find out the facts about this, if every paper in the country should print
them.  Hello? Yes, I want to speak to Miss Morrison."

In a few words she explained Dave's sudden disappearance, stripping the incident of all but
vital facts.  Bert Morrison was all sympathy. "It's a big story, you know," she said, "but
we won't think of it that way.  Not a line, so far as I am concerned.  Edith Duncan is the
girl we need.  A sort of adopted sister to Dave.  She may know more than any of us."

But Edith knew absolutely nothing; nothing, except that her own heart was thrown into a turmoil
of emotions.  She spent the day and the evening down town, rotating about the points where
Dave might likely be found.  And the next morning she called on Irene Hardy.

In spite of all her efforts at self-control she trembled as she pressed the bell; trembled
violently as she waited for the door to open.  She had never met Irene Hardy; it was going
to be a strange experience, introducing herself to the woman who had been preferred over her,
and who had, apparently, proven so unworthy of that preference.  She had difficult things to
say, and even while she said them she must fight a battle to the death with the jealousy of
her natural womanhood.  And she must be very, very careful that in saying things which were
hard to say she did not say hard things.  And, most difficult of all, she must try to pave
the way to a reconciliation between Dave and the woman who stood between her and happiness.

Irene attended the door, as was her custom.  Her eyes took in Edith's face and figure with
mild surprise; Edith was conscious of the process of a quick intellect endeavouring to classify
her;--solicitor, music teacher, business girl?  And in that moment of pause she saw Irene's
eyes, and a strange commotion of feeling surged through her. She may and it is but a testimonial, in
comparing with aware excellent virtuousness: and a ancient one, as the est Dionysius said, that suits
particularly with tyranny themselves.

I must rather learn him the genre was held down of a labourer: ["that whom will have ut crop will sow

["by more you use it come herself to a, by so have the will you be of the capacity to use to that.
 Mrs. Hardy was in the living-room.  "Won't you come up to my work shop?"
Irene answered without change of voice, and they ascended the stairs together.

"I draw a little," Irene was saying, talking fast.  "Oh yes, I have quite commercialized my
art, such as it is.  I draw pictures of shoes, and shirt waists, and other women's wear which
really belong to the field of a feminine artist.  But I haven't lost my soul altogether.  I
daub in colour a little--yes, daub, that's the word.  But it keeps one's soul alive.  You will
hardly recognize that," she said, indicating an easel, "but here is the original."  She ran
up the blind of the window which looked from the room out to the westward, and far over the
brown shoulders of the foothills rose the Rockies, majestic, calm, imperturbable, their white
summits flashing in the blaze of autumn sunshine.  "No warfare there," Irene went on.  "No
plotting, no cruelty, no cowardice, no misunderstanding.  And to think that they will stand
there forever; forever, as we know time; when our city, our civilization, the very memory of
our age shall have gone out.  I never look at them without feeling how--how--how----"

She trembled, and her voice choked; she put out her arm to a chair. When she turned her face
there were tears on it. . . .  "Tell me,--Edith," she said. . . .  "You know" . . .

"I know some things," Edith managed to say.  "I know, now, that I do not know all.  Dave and
I are old friends--my father took a liking to him and he used often to be in our house--he
made him think of our own boy that was killed and would have been just his age--and we got
to know each other very well and he told me about you, long ago.  And last night I found him
at his rooms, almost mad, and swearing to shoot Conward.  And then he told me that--that----"

"Yes?  Yes?  What did he tell you?  I am not afraid----"

Edith turned her eyes to where the white crests of the mountains cut like a crumpled keel through
a sea of infinite blue.  "He told me he saw Conward here . . . upstairs . . . and Conward made
a boast . . . and he would have shot him but you rushed upon him and begged him not to.  He
said you would have taken the bullet yourself rather than it should find Conward."

"Oh, oh," the girl cried, in the pain of one mortally hurt.  "How could he think that?  I didn't
care for him--for Conward--but for Dave.  I knew there had been a quarrel--I didn't know why--and
I knew if Dave shot him--and he can shoot--I've seen him break six bottles out of six on the
gallop--it wasn't self-defence--whatever it was he couldn't plead that--and they'd hang him,
and that was all I saw, Edith, that was all I saw, and I would--yes I would rather have taken
the bullet myself than that that should happen----"

"You poor girl!" said Edith.  "You poor girl," and her arms found the other's neck.  "You have
been hurt, hurt."  And then, under her breath, "More than me."

. . . "What has he done?"

"He talked his problems over with me, and after he had talked awhile he became more reasonable.
He had already been convinced that he should offer his services to his country, in these times.
And I think I persuaded him that it was better to leave vengeance where it belonged. He said
he couldn't remain here, and he has already left for England. I am afraid I encouraged him
to leave at once.  You see, I didn't understand."

Irene had taken a chair, and for some minutes she sat in silence.  "I don't blame you," she
said at length.  "You gave him good advice.  And I don't blame him, although he might have
been less ready to jump at conclusions.  There remains only one thing for me to do."

"What?" said Edith, after a moment's hesitation.

"Follow him!  I shall follow him, and make him understand.  If he must go into battle--with
all that that means--he must go in knowing the truth.  You have been very kind, Miss Duncan.
You have gone out of your way to do me a great service, and you have shown more kindness than
I have any right to claim from a stranger. . . .  I feel, too, the call for vengeance," she
exclaimed, springing to her feet, "but first I must find Dave.  I shall follow him at once.
I shall readily locate him in some way through the military service.  Everything is organized;
they will be able to find his name."

She accompanied her visitor to the door.  They shook hands and looked for a moment in each
other's eyes.  And then Edith burst away and hurried down the street.

Irene had searched London for two weeks.  The confidence of her earlier inquiries had diminished
with each successive blind trail, which, promising results at first, led her into a maze of
confusion and disappointment.  The organization of the military service commanded less enthusiasm
than she had felt a month before.  She saw it struggling with the apparently impossible; it
was as though she, in her little studio, had been suddenly called upon to paint all the portraits
in the world . . .  In some degree she understood the difficulties.  In equal degree she sympathized
with those who were striving to overcome them and she hung on from day to day in her search
with a dogged determination which set its teeth against admitting that the search was hopeless.
Her little store of money was fast dwindling away; she looked into the face of every man in
uniform with a pathetic earnestness that more than once caused her to be misunderstood.

At last one great fear had settled on her heart.  It came upon her first suddenly on shipboard;
she had resolutely thrown it out of her mind; but it had been knocking ever since for admittance,
and more than once she had almost let it in.  Suppose Dave should not enlist under his right
name?  In such a case her chance of finding him was the mere freak of accidental meeting; a
chance not to be banked upon in a country already swarming with its citizen soldiery. . . .
And yet there was nothing to do but keep on.

She had sought a park bench where groups of soldiers were continually moving by.  The lights
shone on their faces, and her own tired eyes followed them incessantly.  Always her ear was
alert for a voice that should set her heart a-pounding, and more than once she had thought
she heard that, voice; more than a score of times she had thought she had seen that figure
with its stride of self-reliance, with strength bulging in every muscle.  And always it had
been to learn that she had been mistaken; always it had been to feel the heart sink just a
little lower than before.  And still she kept on.  There was nothing to do but keep on.

Often she wondered how he would receive her.  That cold look which had frozen his features
when she seized the revolver in his hand; would it still sit there, too distant and detached
to be even scornful?  Would she have it to break down; must she, with the fire of her own affection,
thaw out an entrance through his icy aloofness?  What cost of humiliation would be the price,
and would even any price be accepted?  She could not know; she could only hope and pray and go on.

As she turned her eyes to follow a group of men in uniform she became aware of a soldier sitting
alone in the shadow a short distance away. Some quality about him caught her attention; his
face was not discernible, and his figure was too much in the shadow to more than suggest its
outline, but she found herself regarding him with an intentness that set her pulses racing.
Some strange attraction raised her from her seat; she took a step toward him, then steadied
herself. Should she dare risk it again?  And yet there was something. . . .  She had a sudden
plan.  She would make no inquiry, no apology; she would walk near by and call him by name.
If that name meant nothing to him he would not even notice her presence, but if it should be----

She was within three paces.  Still she could discern nothing definitely, but her pulses were
raging more wildly than ever.  They had deceived her before; could it be that they were deceiving
her again?

"Dave," she said.

He turned quickly in his seat; the light fell on her face and he saw her; he was on his feet
and had taken a step toward her.  Then he stopped, and she saw his features harden as they
had on that dreadful occasion which now seemed so long ago.  Would he turn on his heel?  If
he did she must rush upon him.  She must tell him now, she must plead with him, reason with
him, prevail upon him at all costs.

"Well?" he said.  His voice was mechanical, but in it was something which quickened her hope;
something which suggested that he was making it mechanical because he dared not let it express
the human emotion which was struggling for utterance.

"Let me talk to you, Dave," she pleaded.  "I have followed you around the world for this. 
Let me talk.  I can explain everything."

He stood still so long that she wondered if he never would speak.  She dared not reach her
hands to him, she could only stand and wait.

"Irene," he said, "why did you follow me here?"

"There is only one answer, Dave.  Because I love you, and would follow you anywhere.  No one
can stop me doing that; no one, Dave--except you."

And again he stood, and she knew that he was turning over in his mind things weightier than
life and death, and that when he spoke again his course would be set. The roar had killed to his

Millions of men will be taken from production and turned to purposes of destruction.  They

need much food.  Countries will be devastated; armies will retreat, destroying all food as
they go.  Ships will go down with cargoes of wheat; incendiary fires will swallow warehouses
of food.  I do not regret my decision, I believe my place is in the trenches; but those less

"Me?  But what can I do?"

"Since I left home I've thought a good deal of the old ranch.  I despised it in those prosperous

a dozen years ago.  I think you'll have to go back there, Reenie.  I think you'll have to take
the boy Charlie, and what other help you can get, and go back to the old ranch and raise something
for the soldiers to eat.  You can do it.  There are good men to be had; men who can't very
well carry a rifle, but can drive a plow. And believe me, Reenie, it's the plow that's going
to win.  Go back and put them at it.  Think of every furrow as another trench in the defences
which shall save your home from the fate of Belgium's homes. It's not as easy as going to the
front; it hasn't got the heroic ring to it, and I suppose there are many who will commercialize
it.  Let them.  We shall need their profits after the war to pay our debts.  But it's the thing
that must be done.  And you'll do it, won't you?"

"I'll do what ever needs to be done, Dave.  I'd rather be by your side, or as near as may be,
but if you say that my duty lies back on the old ranch I shall go back to the old ranch and
raise food for my soldier. And when it's all over we shall ride those old hillsides again.
. . . Up the canyon, you remember, Dave?  The little niche in the wall of the canyon, and all
the silence and the sunlight? . . .  Forever. . . ."

CHAPTER XXII

Any philosophy which accepts the principle that the great, over-shadowing events of life are
subject to an intelligent controlling influence must of necessity grant that the same principle
applies to the most commonplace and every-day experiences.  It is impossible to believe that
the World War, for example, has a definite place in the eternal scheme of the universe without
believing the same of the apparently most trivial incident in the life of Kaiser Wilhelm, Lloyd
George, or Woodrow Wilson, or, for that matter, of the humblest soldier in the ranks.  The
course of the greatest stream of events may well be deflected by incidents so commonplace as
to quite escape the notice of the casual observer.

Some such thought as this comforted me--or, at least, would have comforted me, had I thought
it--when a leaking gasoline tank left me, literally as well as figuratively, high and dry in
the foothills.  The sun of an August afternoon blazed its glory from a cloudless sky; far across
the shimmering hills copper-colored patches of ripening wheat stood out ruddy and glowing like
twentieth century armour on the brown breast of the prairie; low in a valley to the left a
ribbon of silver-green mountain water threaded its way through fringes of spruce and cottonwood,
while on the uplands beyond sleek steers drowsed in the sunshine, and far to the westward the
Rockies slept unconcerned in their draperies of afternoon purple.  All these scenes the eye
took in without enthusiasm, almost without approval; and then fell on the whitewashed ranch
buildings almost in the shadow underneath.  And in these days a ranch--almost any ranch--means
gasoline.

I soon was at the door.  The walls had been recently white-washed; there were new shingles
of red cedar on the roof; flowers bloomed by the path that led down to the corrals.  My knock
attracted a little chap of two-and-a-half or three years; his stout hands shoved the screen
back, and I found myself ushered into his company.  There evidently was no one else about,
so I visited, and we talked on those things which are of importance in the world of three-year-olds.

"Muvver's don to the wiver," he confided.  "She tum back pwetty soon."

"And Father?" I asked.  "Where is he?"

Into the dark eyes came a deeper look; they suddenly shone with the spirituality of a life
only three years removed from the infinite.  By what instruction, I afterwards wondered, by
what almost divine charm had she been able to instil into his young mind the honour and the
glory and the pride of it?  For there was pride, and something more than pride; adoration,
perhaps, in his words as he straightened up and said in perfect English, "My father was a soldier.
He was killed at Courcelette."

I looked in his little, sunburned face; in his dark, proud eyes; and presently a strange mist
enveloped the room.  How many little faces, how many pairs of eyes!  It was just fading away
when a step sounded on the walk, and I arose as she reached the door.

"The Man of the House has made me at home," I managed to say.  "I am shipwrecked on the hill,
for a little gasoline."

"There is plenty out in the field, where the tractor is," she replied. "You will find it without
difficulty.  Or if you care to wait here, Charlie may be along presently."

Her voice had sweet, modulated tones, with just that touch of pathos which only the Angel of
Suffering knows how to add.  And her face was fair, and gentle, and a little sad, and very sweet.

"He has told me," I said.  There seemed no reason why I should not say it.  She had entered
into the sisterhood--that universal sisterhood of suffering which the world has known in these
long, lonely years. . . . And it was between us, for we were all in the family.  There was
no occasion to scrape acquaintance by slow, conventional thrust and parry.

"Yes," she said, sitting down, and motioning me to a chair.  "I was bitter at first.  I was
dreadfully bitter at first.  But gradually I got a different view of it.  Gradually I came
to feel and know that all we can feel and know here is on the surface; on the outside, as you
might say, and we can't know the purpose until we are inside.  It is as though life were a
riddle, and the key is hidden, and the door behind which the key is hidden is called Death.
And I don't believe it's all for nothing; I won't believe it's all for nothing.  If I believed
it was all for nothing I would quit; we would all quit.

"Then there is the suffering," she continued, after a pause.  "I don't know why there should
be suffering, but I know if there were no suffering there would be no kindness.  It is not
until you are hit--hard hit--that you begin to think of other people.  Until then all is selfishness.
But we women--we women of the war--we have nothing left to be selfish for.  But we have the
whole world to be unselfish for.  It's all different, and it can never go back.  We won't let
it go back.  We've paid too much to let it go back."

It was hard to find a reply.  "I think I knew your husband, a little," I ventured.  "He was
a--a man."

"He was all that," she said.  She arose and stood for a moment in an attitude of hesitation;
her fingers went to her lips as though enjoining caution.  Then, with quick decision, she went
into an inner room, from which she returned with a letter.

"If you knew him you may care to read this," she said.  "It's very personal, and yet, some
way, everything is impersonal now, in a sense. There has been such a common cause, and such
a wave of common suffering, that it seems to flood out over the individual and embrace us all.
Individualism is gone.  It's the community now; the state; mankind, if you like, above everything.
I suppose, so far as German kultur stands for that, it has been imposed upon the world. . .
.  So this is really, in a sense, your letter as well as mine."

I took it and read:

I have had many letters to write since my service began as a nurse in the war, but never have
I approached the task with such mixed emotions. The pain I must give you I would gladly bear
myself if I could; but it is not all pain; underneath it, running through it in some way I
cannot explain, is a note so much deeper than pain that it must be joy.

You will already have been advised that David Elden was among those who fell at Courcelette.
It is trite to say that you have the sympathy of a grateful nation.  How grateful the nation
really is we shall know by its treatment of the heroes who survive the war, and of the dependents
of those who have crossed over.  But nothing can rob you of the knowledge that he played a
man's part.  Nothing can debar you from that universal fellowship of sympathy which is springing
up wherever manhood is valued at its worth.

A new Order has been born into the world; the Order of Suffering.  Not that it is new, either;
it has been with us since the first mother went into the shadow for her first child; but always
suffering has been incidental; a matter of the individual; a thing to be escaped if possible.
But now it is universal, a thing not to be escaped, but to be accepted, readily, bravely, even
gladly.  And all who so accept it enter into the new Order, and wear its insignia, which is
unselfishness and sympathy and service.  And in that Order you shall not be least, measured
by either your sacrifice or the spirit in which you accept it.

But you are yearning for his last word; for some voice that will seem to you now almost a voice
out of the grave, and I am happy to be able to bring you that word.  It was something more
than chance that guided me that night, as it is every night.

We were well behind the line of actual fighting, but still in the danger zone of artillery
fire.  Night had settled in; all was darkness save for occasional distant flares.  I had become
detached from my party in moving to another station; lost, if you like, yet not lost; never
have I gone so directly to so great a destination.  While trying to get my location I became
aware of a presence; it will sound strange to you, but I became intensely aware of your presence.
Of course I knew it could not be you, in the flesh, but you it seemed to be, nevertheless.
I moved as though led by an invisible hand, and presently I found a bit of shattered wall. The relation
there is to give am; and the who like it is not, that it could own reading. I can think it will

  "I couldn't
go it. . .  And yet--there may be something in it.  It's sacrifice here, Edith.  War is sacrifice.
Sacrifice for other people.  It's not all on the surface.  There's something deeper than we know."

"'He that loseth his life shall find it,'" I quoted.

He did not answer, but I could see his lips smiling again.  His breath was more labored.  A
few drops of rain fell, and some of them spattered on his face.

Presently he chuckled.  It was an eerie sensation, out on that broad plain of death, alone
by the side of this man who was already far into the shadow,--to hear him chuckle.

"That splash of water--you remember--it made me think of the time we pulled the old car into
the stream, and the harness broke, or something, and I had to carry you.  You remember that,
Reenie?"  I could only say "Yes," and press his hand.  His mind was back on the old, old trails.

He became suddenly sober.  "And when Brownie was killed," he went on, "I said it was the innocent
thing that got caught.  Perhaps I was right.  But perhaps it's best to get caught.  Not for
the getting caught, but for the--the compensations.  It's the innocent men that are getting
killed.  And perhaps it's best.  Perhaps there are compensations worth while."

His voice was weaker, and I had to lean close to catch his words.

"I'm going--out," he said.  "Kiss me, Reenie."

And then I kissed him--for you.

Suddenly he sat up.

"The mountains!" he exclaimed, and his voice was a-thrill with the pride of his old hills.
"See, the moonlight--on the mountains!"

Then his strength, which seemed to have gathered itself for this one last vision of the place
of his boyhood, gave way, and he fell back. And he did not speak any more.

And what can I add?  Dear, it is not defeat.  It is promise.  It is hope.

Some day we shall know. I'element my conviction that'arf a appropriation we gives'him is spend

  "Won't you let me tell the
story?" I said at length.  "The world is full of sorrow, and it needs voices to give that sorrow
words, and perhaps turn it into hope--as this letter does."

She hesitated, and I realized then how much I had asked.  "It is the story of my life--my soul,"
she said.  "Yet, if it would help----"

"Without names," I hastened to explain.  "Without real names of places or people."

And so, in that little white-washed home, where the brown hills rise around and the placid
mountains look down from the distance, and a tongue of spruce trees beyond the stream stands
sentinel against the open prairie, she is carrying on, not in despondency and bitterness, but
in service and in hope.  And so her sisters, all this world over, must carry on, until their
sweetness and their sacrifice shall fill up and flood over all the valleys of hate. . . . 
And if you should chance that way, and if you should win the confidence of young Three-year-old,
he may stand for you and say, with his voice filled with the honour and the glory and the pride
of it,

"My father was a soldier.  He was killed at Courcelette."

THE END
