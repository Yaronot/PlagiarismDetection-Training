MADAME:--Cardinal Mazarin thought of nothing else now but how to rid himself of the obligations
he lay under to the Prince de Conde, who had actually saved him from the gallows.  And his
principal view was an alliance with the House of Vendome, who had on some occasions opposed
the interest of the family of Conde.

In Paris the people libelled not only the Cardinal, but the Queen. Indeed it was not our interest
to discourage libels and ballads against the Cardinal, but it concerned us to suppress such
as were levelled against the Queen and Government.  It is not to be imagined what uneasiness
the wrath of the people gave us upon that head.  Two criminals, one of whom was a printer,
being condemned to be hanged for publishing some things fit to be burnt and for libelling the
Queen, cried out, when they were upon the scaffold, that they were to be put to death for publishing
verses against Mazarin, upon which the people rescued them from justice.

On the other hand, some gay young gentlemen of the Court, who were in Mazarin's interest, had
a mind to make his name familiar to the Parisians, and for that end made a famous display in
the public walks of the Tuileries, where they had grand suppers, with music, and drank the
Cardinal's health publicly.  We took little notice of this, till they boasted at Saint Germain
that the Frondeurs were glad to give them the wall.  And then we thought it high time to correct
them, lest the common people should think they did it by authority.  For this end M. de Beaufort
and a hundred other gentlemen went one night to the house where they supped, overturned the
table, and broke the musicians' violins over their heads.

Being informed that the Prince de Conde intended to oblige the King to return to Paris, I was
resolved to have all the merit of an action which would be so acceptable to the citizens. 
I therefore resolved to go to the Court at Compiegne, which my friends very much opposed, for
fear of the danger to which I might be exposed, but I told them that what is absolutely necessary
is not dangerous.

I went accordingly, and as I was going up-stairs to the Queen's apartments, a man, whom I never
saw before or since, put a note into my hand with these words: "If you enter the King's domicile,
you are a dead man."  But I was in already, and it was too late to go back.  Being past the
guard-chamber, I thought myself secure.  I told the Queen that I was come to assure her Majesty
of my most humble obedience, and of the disposition of the Church of Paris to perform all the
services it owed to their Majesties.  The Queen seemed highly pleased, and was very kind to
me; but when we mentioned the Cardinal, though she urged me to it, I excused myself from going
to see him, assuring her Majesty that such a visit would put it out of my power to do her service.
It was impossible for her to contain herself any longer; she blushed, and it was with much
restraint that she forbore using harsh language, as she herself confessed afterwards.

Servien said one day that there was a design to assassinate me at his table by the Abbe Fouquet;
and M. de Vendome, who had just come from his table, pressed me to be gone, saying that there
were wicked designs hatching against me.

I returned to Paris, having accomplished everything I wanted, for I had removed the suspicion
of the Court that the Frondeurs were against the King's return.  I threw upon the Cardinal
all the odium attending his Majesty's delay.  I braved Mazarin, as it were, upon his throne,
and secured to myself the chief honour of the King's return.

The Court was received at Paris as kings always were and ever will be, namely, with acclamations,
which only please such as like to be flattered.  A group of old women were posted at the entrance
of the suburbs to cry out, "God save his Eminence!" who sat in the King's coach and thought
himself Lord of Paris; but at the end of three or four days he found himself much mistaken.
Ballads and libels still flew about. The Frondeurs appeared bolder than ever.  M. de Beaufort
and I rode sometimes alone, with one lackey only behind our coach, and at other times we went
with a retinue of fifty men in livery and a hundred gentlemen.  We diversified the scene as
we thought it would be most acceptable to the spectators.  The Court party, who blamed us from
morning to night, nevertheless imitated us in their way.  Everybody took an advantage of the
Ministry from our continual pelting of his Eminence. The Prince, who always made too much or
too little of the Cardinal, continued to treat him with contempt; and, being disgusted at being
refused the post of Superintendent of the Seas, the Cardinal endeavoured to soothe him with
the vain hopes of other advantages.

The Prince, being one day at Court, and seeing the Cardinal give himself extraordinary airs,
said, as he was going out of the Queen's cabinet, "Adieu, Mars."  This was told all over the
city in a quarter of an hour. I and Noirmoutier went by appointment to his house at four o'clock
in the morning, when he seemed to be greatly troubled.  He said that he could not determine
to begin a civil war, which, though the only means to separate the Queen from the Cardinal,
to whom she was so strongly attached, yet it was both against his conscience and honour.  He
added that he should never forget his obligations to us, and that if he should come to any
terms with the Court, he would, if we thought proper, settle our affairs also, and that if
we had not a mind to be reconciled to the Court, he would, in case it did attack us, publicly
undertake our protection.  We answered that we had no other design in our proposals than the
honour of being his humble servants, and that we should be very sorry if he had retarded his
reconciliation with the Queen upon our account, praying that we might be permitted to continue
in the same disposition towards the Cardinal as we were then, which we declared should not
hinder us from paying all the respect and duty which we professed for his Highness.

I must not forget to acquaint you that Madame de Guemenee, who ran away from Paris in a fright
the moment it was besieged, no sooner heard that I had paid a visit to Mademoiselle de Chevreuse
than she returned to town in a rage.  I was in such a passion with her for having cowardly
deserted me that I took her by the throat, and she was so enraged at my familiarity with Mademoiselle
de Chevreuse that she threw a candlestick at my head, but in a quarter of an hour we were very
good friends.

The Prince de Conde was no sooner reconciled with the Court than he was publicly reproached
in the city for breaking his word with the Frondeurs; but I convinced him that he could not
think such treatment strange in a city so justly exasperated against Mazarin, and that, nevertheless,
he might depend on my best services, for which he assured me of his constant friendship.

Moissans, now Marechal d'Albret, who was at the head of the King's gendarmes, accustomed himself
and others to threaten the chief minister, who augmented the public odium against himself by
reestablishing Emeri, a man detested by all the kingdom. Examination would be yet hide my measurement

  There are a great many gentlemen engaged with me who, in such a juncture, would
be ready to serve the Queen.  And if it seemed good to your Majesty to entrust one of them
with some important employment, I should be more pleased than with ten cardinals' hats."

The Cardinal told the Queen that nothing was more just, and the affair should be considered
between him and me.

We had several conferences, at which we agreed on gratifications for some of our friends and
to arrest the Prince de Conde, the Prince de Conti, and the Duc de Longueville.

The Cardinal took occasion to speak of the treachery of La Riviere. "This man," said he, "takes
me to be the most stupid creature living, and thinks he shall be to-morrow a cardinal.  I diverted
myself to-day with letting him try on some scarlet cloth I lately received from Italy, and
I put it near his face to know whether a scarlet colour or carnation became him best."

I heard from Rome that his Eminence was not behindhand with La Riviere upon the score of treachery.
For on the very day he got him nominated by the King, he wrote a letter to Cardinal Sachelli
more fit to recommend him to a yellow cap than to a red one.  This letter, nevertheless, was
full of tenderness for La Riviere, which Mazarin knew was the only way to ruin him with Pope
Innocent, who hated Mazarin and all his adherents.

Madame de Chevreuse undertook to see how the Duc d'Orleans would relish the design of imprisoning
the Princes.  She told him that, though the Queen was not satisfied with M. le Prince, yet
she could not form a resolution of apprehending him without the concurrence of his Royal Highness.
She magnified the advantages of bringing over to the King's service the powerful faction of
the Fronde, and the daily dangers Paris was exposed to, both by fire and sword.  This last
reason touched him as much or more than all, for he trembled every time he came to the Parliament;
M. le Prince very often could not prevail upon him to go at all, and a fit of colic was generally
assigned as the reason of his absence.  At length he consented, and on the 18th of January
the three Princes were put under arrest by three officers of the Queen's Guards.

The people having a notion that M. de Beaufort was apprehended, ran to their arms, which I
caused to be laid down immediately, by marching through the streets with flambeaux before me.
M. de Beaufort did the like, and the night concluded with bonfires.

The Queen sent a letter from the King to the Parliament with the reasons, which were neither
strong nor well set out, why the Prince de Conde was confined.  However, we obtained a decree
for our absolution.

The Princesses were ordered to retire to Chantilly.  Madame de Longueville went towards Normandy,
but found no sanctuary there, for the Parliament of Rouen sent her a message to desire her
to depart from the city.  The Duc de Richelieu would not receive her into Havre, and from there
she retired to Dieppe.

M. de Bouillon, who after the peace was strongly attached to the Prince de Conde, went in great
haste to Turenne; M. de Turenne got into Stenai; M. de La Rochefoucault, then Prince de Marsillac,
returned home to Poitou; and Marechal de Breze, father-in-law to the Prince de Conde, went
to Saumur.

There was a declaration published and registered in Parliament against them, whereby they were
ordered to wait on the King within fifteen days, upon pain of being proceeded against as disturbers
of the public peace and guilty of high treason.

The Court carried all before them.  Madame de Longueville, upon the King going into Normandy,
escaped by sea into Holland, whence she went afterwards to Arras, to try La Tour, one of her
husband's pensioners, who offered her his person, but refused her the place.  She repaired
at last to Stenai, whither M. de Turenne went to meet her, with all the friends and servants
of the confined Princes that he could muster.  The King went from Normandy to Burgundy, and
returned to Paris crowned with laurels of victory.

The Princess-dowager, who had been ordered to retire to Bourges, came with a petition to Parliament,
praying for their protection to stay in Paris, and that she might have justice done her for
the illegal confinement of the Princes her children.  She fell at the feet of the Duc d'Orleans,
begged the protection of the Duc de Beaufort, and said to me that she had the honour to be
my kinswoman.  M. de Beaufort was very much perplexed what to do, and I was nearly ready to
die for shame; but we could do nothing for her, and she was obliged to go to Valery.

Several private annuitants, who had made a noise in the assemblies at the Hotel de Ville, were
afraid of being called to account, and therefore, after M. le Prince was arrested, they desired
me to procure a general amnesty.  I spoke about it to the Cardinal, who seemed very pliable,
and, showing me his hatband, which was 'a la mode de la Fronde', said he hoped himself to be
comprised in that amnesty; but he shuffled it off so long that it was not published and registered
in Parliament till the 12th of May, and it would not have been obtained then had not I threatened
vigorously to prosecute the Crown witnesses, of which they were mightily apprehensive, being
so conscious of the heinousness of their crime that two of them had already made their escape.

The present calm hardly deserved that name, for the storm of war began to rise again in several
places at once.

Madame de Longueville and M. de Turenne made a treaty with the Spaniards, and the latter joined
their army, which entered Picardy and besieged Guise, after having taken Catelet; but for want
of provisions the Archduke was obliged to raise the siege.  M. de Turenne levied troops with
Spanish money, and was joined by the greater part of the officers commanding the soldiers that
went under the name of the Prince's troops.

The wretched conduct of M. d'Epernon had so confounded the affairs of Guienne that nothing
but his removal could retrieve them.

One of the greatest mischiefs which the despotic authority of ministers has occasioned in the
world in these later times is a practice, occasioned by their own private mistaken interests,
of always supporting superiors against their inferiors.  It is a maxim borrowed from Machiavelli,
whom few understand, and whom too many cry up for an able man because he was always wicked.
He was very far from being a complete statesman, and was frequently out in his politics, but
I think never more grossly mistaken than in this maxim, which I observed as a great weakness
in Mazarin, who was therefore the less qualified to settle the affairs of Guienne, which were
in so much confusion that I believe if the good sense of Jeannin and Villeroi had been infused
into the brains of Cardinal de Richelieu, it would not have been sufficient to set them right.

Senneterre, perceiving that Cardinal Mazarin and I were not cordial friends, undertook to reconcile
us, and for that end took me to the Cardinal, who embraced me very tenderly, said he laid his
heart upon the table, that was one of his usual phrases,--and protested he would talk as freely
to me as if I were his own son.  I did not believe a word of what he said, but I assured his
Eminence that I would speak to him as if he were my father, and I was as good as my word. 
I told him I had no personal interest in view but to disengage myself from the public disturbances
without any private advantage, and that for the same reason I thought myself obliged to come
off with reputation and honour. I desired him to consider that my age and want of skill in
public affairs could not give him any jealousy that I aimed to be the First Minister. I conjured
him to consider also that the influence I had over the people of Paris, supported by mere necessity,
did rather reflect disgrace than honour upon my dignity, and that he ought to believe that
this one reason was enough to make me impatient to be rid of all these public broils, besides
a thousand other inconveniences arising every moment, which disgusted me with faction. I have

Soon after this the Parliament of Toulouse wrote to that of Paris concerning the disturbances
in Guienne, part whereof belonged to their jurisdiction, and expressly demanded a decree of
union.  But the Duc d'Orleans warded off the blow very dexterously, which was of great consequence,
and, more by his address than by his authority, brought the Parliament to dismiss the deputies
with civil answers and insignificant expressions, upon which President Bellievre said to me,
"What pleasure should we not take in acting as we do if it were for persons that had but the
sense to appreciate it!"

The Parliament did not continue long in that calm.  They passed a decree to interrogate the
State prisoners in the Bastille, broke out sometimes like a whirlwind, with thunder and lightning,
against Cardinal Mazarin; at other times they complained of the misapplication of the public
funds. We had much ado to ward off the blows, and should not have been able to hold out long
against the fury of the waves but for the news of the Peace of Bordeaux, which was registered
there on October the 1st, 1650, and put the Prince de Conde's party into consternation.

One mean artifice of Cardinal Mazarin's polity was always to entertain some men of our own
party, with whom, half reconciled, he played fast and loose before our eyes, and was eternally
negotiating with them, deceiving and being deceived in his turn.  The consequence of all this
was a great, thick cloud, wherein the Frondeurs themselves were at last involved; but which
they burst with a thunderclap.

The Cardinal, being puffed up with his success in settling the troubles of Guienne, thought
of nothing else than crowning his triumph by chastising the Frondeurs, who, he said, had made
use of the King's absence to alienate the Duc d'Orleans from his service, to encourage the
revolt at Bordeaux, and to make themselves masters of the persons of the Princes.  At the same
time, he told the Princess Palatine that he detested the cruel hatred I bore to the Prince
de Conde, and that the propositions I made daily to him on that score were altogether unworthy
of a Christian.  Yet he suggested to the Duc d'Orleans that I made great overtures to him to
be reconciled to the Court, but that he could not trust me, because I was from morning to night
negotiating with the friends of the Prince de Conde.  Thus the Cardinal rewarded me for what
I did with incredible application and, I must say, uncommon sincerity for the Queen's service
during the Court's absence.  I do not mention the dangers I was in twice or thrice a day, surpassing
even those of soldiers in battles.  For imagine, I beseech you, what pain and anguish I must
have been in at hearing myself called a Mazarinist, and at having to bear all the odium annexed
to that hateful appellation in a city where he made it his business to destroy me in the opinion
of a Prince whose nature it was to be always in fear and to trust none but such as hoped to
rise by my fall.

The Cardinal gave himself such airs after the peace at Bordeaux that some said my best way
would be to retire before the King's return.

Cardinal Mazarin had been formerly secretary to Pancirole, the Pope's nuncio for the peace
of Italy, whom he betrayed, and it was proved that he had a secret correspondence with the
Governor of Milan.  Pancirole, being created cardinal and Secretary of State to the Church,
did not forget the perfidiousness of his secretary, now created cardinal by Pope Urban, at
the request of Cardinal de Richelieu, and did not at all endeavour to qualify the anger which
Pope Innocent had conceived against Mazarin after the assassination of one of his nephews,
in conjunction with Cardinal Anthony.

[Anthony Barberini, nephew to Urban VIII., created Cardinal 1628, made Protector of the Crown
of France 1633, and Great Almoner of the Kingdom 1653.  He was afterwards Bishop of Poitiers,
and, lastly, Archbishop of Rheims in 1657.  Died 1671.]

Pancirole, who thought he could not affront Mazarin more than by contributing to make me cardinal,
did me all the kind offices with Pope Innocent, who gave him leave to treat with me in that affair.

Madame de Chevreuse told the Queen all that she had observed in my conduct in the King's absence,
and what she had seen was certainly one continued series of considerable services done to the
Queen.

She recounted at last all the injustice done me, the contempt put upon me, and the just grounds
of my diffidence, which, she said, of necessity ought to be removed, and that the only means
of removing it was the hat. The Queen was in a passion at this.  The Cardinal defended himself,
not by an open denial, for he had offered it me several times, but by recommending patience,
intimating that a great monarch should be forced to nothing.  Monsieur, seconding Madame de
Chevreuse in her attack, assailed the Cardinal, who, at least in appearance, gave way, out
of respect for his Royal Highness.  Madame de Chevreuse, having brought them to parley, did
not doubt that she should also bring them to capitulate, especially when she saw the Queen
was appeased, and had told his Royal Highness that she was infinitely obliged to him, and would
do what her Council judged most proper and reasonable.  This Council, which was only a specious
name, consisted only of the Cardinal, the Keeper of the Seals, Tellier, and Servien.

The matter was proposed to the Council by the Cardinal with much importunity, concluding with
a most submissive petition to the Queen to condescend to the demand of the Duc d'Orleans, and
to what the services and merits of the Coadjutor demanded.  The proposition was rejected with
such resolution and contempt as is very unusual in Council in opposition to a Prime Minister.
Tellier and Servien thought it sufficient not to applaud him; but the Keeper of the Seals quite
forgot his respect for the Cardinal, accused him of prevarication and weakness, and threw himself
at her Majesty's feet, conjuring her in the name of the King her son, not to authorise, by
an example which he called fatal, the insolence of a subject who was for wresting favours from
his sovereign, sword in hand. The Queen was moved at this, and the poor Cardinal owned he had
been too easy and pliant.

I had myself given a very natural handle to my adversaries to expose me so egregiously.  I
have been guilty of many blunders, but I think this is the grossest that I ever was guilty
of in all my life.  I have frequently made this observation, that when men have, through fear
of miscarriage, hesitated a long time about any undertaking of consequence, the remaining impressions
of their fear commonly push them afterwards with too much precipitancy upon the execution of
their design.  And this was my case. It was with the greatest reluctance that I determined
to accept the dignity of a cardinal, because I thought it too mean to form a pretension to
it without certainty of success; and no sooner was I engaged in the pursuit of it but the impression
of the former fearful ideas hurried me on, as it were, to the end, that I might get as soon
as possible out of the disagreeable state of uncertainty.

The Cardinal would have paid my debts, given me the place of Grand Almoner, etc.; but if he
had added twelve cardinals' hats into the bargain, I should have begged his excuse.  I was
now engaged with Monsieur, who had, meanwhile, resolved upon the release of the Princes from
their confinement.

Cardinal Mazarin, after his return to Paris, made it his chief study to divide the Fronde.
He thought to materially weaken my interest with Monsieur by detaching from me Madame de Chevreuse,
for whom he had a natural tenderness, and to give me a mortal blow by embroiling me with Mademoiselle
her daughter.  To do this effectually he found a rival, who, he hoped, would please her better,
namely, M. d'Aumale, handsome as Apollo, and one who was very likely to suit the temper of
Mademoiselle de Chevreuse.  He had entirely devoted himself to the Cardinal's interest, looked
upon himself as very much honoured by this commission, and haunted the Palace of Chevreuse
so diligently that I did not doubt but that he was sent thither to act the second part of the
comedy which had miscarried so shamefully in the hands of M. de Candale.  I watched all his
movements, and complained to Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, but she gave me indirect answers. 
I began to be out of humour, and was soon appeased. I grew peevish again; and Mademoiselle
de Chevreuse saying in his presence, to please me and to sting him, that she could not imagine
how it was possible to bear a silly fellow, "Pardon me, mademoiselle," replied I, "we suffer
fops sometimes very patiently for the sake of their extravagances."  This man was notoriously
foppish and extravagant.  My answer pleased, and we soon got rid of him at the Palace of Chevreuse.
But he thought to have despatched me, for he hired one Grandmaison, a ruffian, to assassinate
me, who apprised me of his design.  The first time I met M. d'Aumale, which was at the Duc
d'Orleans's house, I did not fail to let him know it; but I told it him in a whisper, saying
that I had too much respect for the House of Savoy to publish it to the world. He denied the
fact, but in such a manner as to make it more evident, because he conjured me to keep it secret.
I gave him my word, and I kept it.

Madame de Guemenee, with whom I had several quarrels, proposed to the Queen likewise to despatch
me, by shutting me up in a greenhouse in her garden, which she might easily have done, because
I often went to her alone by night; but the Cardinal, fearing that the people would have suspected
him as the author of my sudden disappearance, would not enter into the project, so it was dropped.

The Cardinal's escape was the common topic of conversation, and different reasons were assigned
to it, according to the various interests of different parties.  As for my part, I am very
well persuaded that fear was the only reason of his flight, and that nothing else hindered
him from taking the King and the Queen along with him.  You will see in the sequel of this
history that he endeavoured to get their Majesties out of Paris soon after he had made his
escape, and that it was concerted in all probability before he left the Court; but I could
never understand why he did not put it into execution at a time when he had no reason to fear
the least opposition.

On the 17th the Parliament ordered the thanks of the House to be returned to the Queen for
removing the Cardinal, and that she should be humbly asked to issue an order for setting the
Princes at liberty, and a declaration for excluding all foreigners forever from the King's
Council. The First President being deputed with the message, the Queen told him that she could
return him no answer till she had conferred with the Duc d'Orleans, to whom she immediately
deputed the Keeper of the Seals, Marechal Villeroi, and Tellier; but he told them that he could
not go to the Palais Royal till the Princes were set at liberty and the Cardinal removed further
from the Court.  For he observed to the House that the Cardinal was no further off than at
Saint Germain, where he governed all the kingdom as before, that his nephew and his nieces
were yet at Court; and the Duke proposed that the Parliament should humbly beseech the Queen
to explain whether the Cardinal's removal was for good and all.  If I had not seen it, I could
not have imagined what a heat the House was in that day.  Some were for an order that there
should be no favourites in France for the future.  They became at length of the opinion of
his Royal Highness, namely, to address the Queen to ask her to explain herself with relation
to the removal of Cardinal Mazarin and to solicit orders for the liberty, of the Princes.

On the same day the Queen sent again to desire the Duc d'Orleans to come and take his place
in the Council, and to tell him that, in case he did not think it convenient, she would send
the Keeper of the Seals to concert necessary measures with him for setting the Princes at liberty.
His Royal Highness accepted the second, but rejected the first proposal, and treated M. d'Elbeuf
roughly, because he was very pressing with his Royal Highness to go to the King's Palace. 
The messengers likewise acquainted the Duke that they were ordered to assure him that the removal
of the Cardinal was forever.  You will see presently that, in all probability, had his Royal
Highness gone that day to Court, the Queen would have left Paris and carried the Duke along
with her.

On the 19th the Parliament decreed that, in pursuance of the Queen's declaration, the Cardinal
should, within the space of fifteen days, depart from his Majesty's dominions, with all his
relations and foreign servants; otherwise, they should be proceeded against as outlaws, and
it should be lawful for anybody to despatch them out of the way.

I suspected that the King would leave Paris that very day, and I was almost asleep when I was
sent for to go to the Duc d'Orleans, whom Mademoiselle de Chevreuse went to awaken in the meantime;
and, while I was dressing, one of her pages brought me a note from her, containing only these
few words:

"Make haste to Luxembourg, and be upon your guard on the way."  I found Mademoiselle de Chevreuse
in his chamber, who acquainted me that the King was out of bed, and had his boots on ready
for a journey from Paris.

I waited on the Duke, and said, "There is but one remedy, which is, to secure the gates of
Paris."  Yet all that we could obtain of him was to send the captain of the Swiss Guards to
wait on the Queen and desire her Majesty to weigh the consequences of an action of that nature.
His Duchess, perceiving that this expedient, if not supported effectually, would ruin all,
and that his Royal Highness was still as irresolute as ever, called for pen and ink that lay
upon the table in her cabinet, and wrote these words on a large sheet of paper:

M. le Coadjuteur is ordered to take arms to hinder the adherents of Cardinal Mazarin, condemned
by the Parliament, from carrying the King out of Paris. MARGUERITE DE LORRAINE.

Des Touches, who found the Queen bathed in tears, was charged by her Majesty to assure the
Duc d'Orleans that she never thought of carrying away the King, and that it was one of my tricks.

The Duc d'Orleans saying at the House next day that orders for the Princes' liberty would be
despatched in two hours' time, the First President said, with a deep sigh, "The Prince de Conde
is at liberty, but our King, our sovereign Lord and King, is a prisoner."  The Duc d'Orleans,
being now not near so timorous as before, because he had received more acclamations in the
streets than ever, replied, "Truly the King has been Mazarin's prisoner, but, God be praised,
he is now in better hands."

The Cardinal, who hovered about Paris till he heard the city had taken up arms, posted to Havre-de-Grace,
where he fawned upon the Prince de Conde with a meanness of spirit that is hardly to be imagined;
for he wept, and even fell down on his knees to the Prince, who treated him with the utmost
contempt, giving him no thanks for his release.

On the 16th of February the Princes, being set at liberty, arrived in Paris, and, after waiting
on the Queen, supped with M. de Beaufort and myself at the Duc d'Orleans's house, where we
drank the King's health and "No Mazarin!"

On the 17th his Royal Highness carried them to the Parliament House, and it is remarkable that
the same people who but thirteen months before made bonfires for their confinement did the
same now for their release.

On the 20th the declaration demanded of the King against the Cardinal, being brought to be
registered in Parliament, was sent back with indignation because the reason of his removal
was coloured over with so many encomiums that it was a perfect panegyric.  Honest Broussel,
who always went greater lengths than anybody, was for excluding all cardinals from the Ministry,
as well as foreigners in general, because they swear allegiance to the Pope.  The First President,
thinking to mortify me, lauded Broussel for a man of admirable good sense, and espoused his
opinion; and the Prince de Conde, too, seemed to be overjoyed, saying, "It is a charming echo."
Indeed, I might well be troubled to think that the very day after a treaty wherein the Duc
d'Orleans declared that he was resolved to make me a cardinal, the Prince should second a proposition
so derogatory to that dignity.  But the truth is, the Prince had no hand in it, for it came
naturally, and was supported for no other reason but because nothing that was brought as an
argument against Mazarin could then fail of being approved at the same time.  I had some reason
to think that the motion was concerted beforehand by my enemies, to keep me out of the Ministry.
Nevertheless, I was not offended with the Parliament, the bulk of whom I knew to be my friends,
whose sole aim was to effectually demolish Mazarin, and I acquiesced in the solid satisfaction
which I had in being considered in the world as the expeller of Mazarin, whom everybody hated,
and the deliverer of the Princes, who were as much their darlings.

The continual chicanery of the Court provoked the Parliament of Paris to write to all the Parliaments
of France to issue decrees against Cardinal Mazarin, which they did accordingly.  The Parliament
obliged the Court to issue a declaration setting forth the innocence of the Princes, and another
for the exclusion of cardinals--French as well as foreigners--from the King's Council, and
the Parliament had no rest till the Cardinal retired from Sedan to Breule, a house belonging
to the Elector of Cologne.

I had advice sent me from the Duchesse d'Orleans to be upon my guard, and that she was on the
point of dying with fear lest the Duke should be forced by the daily menaces of the Court to
abandon me.  I thereupon waited on the Duke, and told him that, having had the honour and satisfaction
of serving his Royal Highness in the two affairs which he had most at heart,--namely, the expelling
of Mazarin and the releasing of the Princes his cousins,--I found myself now obliged to reassume
the functions of my profession; that the present opportunity seemed both to favour and invite
my retreat, and if I neglected it I should be the most imprudent man living, because my presence
for the future would not only be useless but even prejudicial to his Royal Highness, whom I
knew to be daily importuned and irritated by the Court party merely upon my account; and therefore
I conjured him to make himself easy, and give me leave to retire to my cloister.  The Duke
spared no kind words to retain me in his service, promised never to forsake me, confessed that
he had been urged to it by the Queen, and that, though his reunion with her Majesty and the
Princes obliged him to put on the mask of friendship, yet he could never forget the great affronts
and injuries which he had received from the Court.  But all this could not dissuade me, and
the Duke at last gave his approbation, with repeated assurances to allow me a place next his
heart and to correspond with me in secret.

Having taken my leave of the Princes, I retired accordingly to my cloister of Notre-Dame, where
I did not trust Providence so far as to omit the use of human means for defending myself against
the insults of my enemies.

Except the visits which I paid in the night-time to the Hotel de Chevreuse, I conversed with
none but canons and cures.  I was the object of raillery both at Court and at the Palace of
Conde; and because I had set up a bird-cage at a window, it became a common jest that "the
Coadjutor whistled to the linnets."  The disposition of Paris, however, made amends for the
raillery of the Court.  I found myself very secure, while other people were very uneasy.  The
cures, parish priests, and even the mendicants, informed themselves with diligence of the negotiations
of the Prince de Conde.  I gave M. de Beaufort a thrust now and then, which he knew not how
to parry with all his cunning, and the Duc d'Orleans, who in his heart was enraged against
the Court, continued his correspondence with me very faithfully.

Soon after, the Marechal du Plessis came to me at midnight and embraced me, saying, "I greet
you as our Prime Minister."  When he saw that I smiled, he added, "I do not jest; you may be
so if you please.  The Queen has ordered me to tell you that she puts the King and Crown into
your hands."  He showed me a letter written in the Cardinal's own hand to the Queen, which
concluded thus:

"You know, madame, that the greatest enemy I have in the world is the Coadjutor.  Make use
of him rather than treat with the Prince upon those conditions he demands.  Make him a cardinal,
give him my place, and lodge him in my apartments.  Perhaps he will be still more attached
to the Duc d'Orleans than to your Majesty; but the Duke is not for the ruin of the State. 
His intentions in the main are not bad.  In a word, madame, do anything rather than grant the
Prince his demand to have the government of Provence added to that of Guienne." 

Immediately, place found away to how are me come, having use to try would have both be known to me

The First President told him that he was sorry to see him there before he had waited on the
King, and that it seemed as if he were for setting up altar against altar.  This nettled the
Prince to that degree that he said that those who talked against him had only self-interests
in view.  The First President denied that he had any such aim, and said that he was accountable
to the King only for his actions.  Then he exaggerated the danger of the State from the unhappy
division of the royal family.

Finally it was resolved, 'nemine contradicente', that the Solicitor-General should be commissioned
to prosecute those who had advised the arrest of the Prince de Conde; that the Queen's promise
for the safety of the Prince should be registered; that his Royal Highness should be desired
by the whole assembly to go and wait on the King; and that the decrees passed against the servitors
of Mazarin should be put into execution.  The Prince, who seemed very well satisfied, said

  Therefore she advised me to act my part well, and she should not despair of
success. "When you are with the Queen," said she, "be serious; look continually on her hands,
storm against the Cardinal, and I will take care of the rest" I asked two or three audiences
of the Queen upon very trifling occasions, followed Madame de Chevreuse's plan very closely,
and carried my resentment and passion against the Cardinal even to extravagance.  The Queen,
who was naturally a coquette, understood those airs, and acquainted Madame de Chevreuse therewith,
who pretended to be surprised, saying, "Indeed, I have heard the Coadjutor talk of your Majesty
whole days with delight; but if the conversation happened to touch upon the Cardinal, he was
no longer the same man, and even raved against your Majesty, but immediately relented towards
you, though never towards the Cardinal."

Madame de Chevreuse, who was the Queen's confidante in her youth, gave me such a history of
her early days as I cannot omit giving you, though I should have done it sooner.  She told
me that the Queen was neither in body nor mind truly Spanish; that she had neither the temperament
nor the vivacity of her nation, but only the coquetry of it, which she retained in perfection;
that M. Bellegarde, a gallant old gentleman, after the fashion of the Court of Henri III.,
pleased her till he was going to the army, when he begged for one favour before his departure,
which was only to put her hand to the hilt of his sword, a compliment so insipid that her Majesty
was out of conceit with him ever after.  She approved the gallant manner of M. de Montmorency
much more than she loved his person. The aversion she had to the pedantic behaviour of Cardinal
de Richelieu, who in his amours was as ridiculous as he was in other things excellent, made
her irreconcilable to his addresses.  She had observed from the beginning of the Regency a
great inclination in the Queen for Mazarin, but that she had not been able to discover how
far that inclination went, because she (Madame de Chevreuse) had been banished from the Court
very soon after; and that upon her return to France, after the siege of Paris, the Queen was
so reserved at first with her that it was impossible for her to dive into her secrets.  That
since she regained her Majesty's favour she had sometimes observed the same airs in her with
regard to Cardinal Mazarin as she used to display formerly in favour of the Duke of Buckingham;
but at other times she thought that there was no more between them than a league of friendship.
The chief ground for her conjecture was the impolite and almost rude way in which the Cardinal
conversed with her Majesty.  "But, however," said Madame de Chevreuse, "when I reflect on the
Queen's humour, all this may admit of another interpretation. Buckingham used to tell me that
he had been in love with three Queens, and was obliged to curb all the three; therefore I cannot
tell what to think of the matter."

To resume the history of more public affairs.  I did not so far please myself with the figure
I made against the Prince (though I thought it very much for my honour), but I saw clearly
that I stood on a dangerous precipice.

"Whither are we going?"  I said to M. Bellievre, who seemed to be overjoyed that the Prince
had not been able to devour me; "for whom do we labour?  I know that we are obliged to act
as we do; I know, too, that we cannot do better; but should we rejoice at the fatal necessity
which pushes us on to exert an action comparatively good and which will unavoidably end in
a superlative evil?"

"I understand you," said the President, "and will interrupt you for one moment to tell you
what I learned of Cromwell" (whom he had known in England).  "He told me one day that it is
then we are mounting highest when we ourselves do not know whither we are going."

"You know, monsieur," said I to Bellievre, "that I abhor Cromwell; and whatever is commonly
reported of his great parts, if he is of this opinion, I must pronounce him a fool."

I mentioned this dialogue for no other purpose than to observe how dangerous it is to talk
disrespectfully of men in high positions; for it was carried to Cromwell, who remembered it
with a great deal of resentment on an occasion which I shall mention hereafter, and said to
M. de Bourdeaux, Ambassador of France, then in England, "I know but one man in the world who
despises me, and that is Cardinal de Retz."  This opinion of him was likely to have cost me
very dear.  I return from this digression.

On the 31st, Melayer, valet de chambre to the Cardinal, arrived with a despatch to the Queen,
in which were these words: "Give the Prince de Conde all the declarations of his innocence
that he can desire, provided you can but amuse him and hinder him from giving you the slip."

On the 4th the Prince de Conde insisted in Parliament on a formal decree for declaring his
innocence, which was granted, but deferred to be published till the 7th of September (the day
that the King came of age), on pretence of rendering it more authentic and solemn by the King's
presence, but really to gain time, and see what influence the splendour of royalty, which was
to be clothed that day with all the advantages of pomp, would have upon the minds of the people.

But the Prince de Conde, who had reason to distrust both the Fronde and the Court, did not
appear at the ceremony, and sent the Prince de Conti to the King to desire to be excused, because
the calumnies and treacheries of his enemies would not suffer him to come to the Palace; adding
that he kept away out of pure respect to his Majesty.  This last expression, which seemed to
intimate that otherwise he might have gone thither without danger, provoked the Queen to that
degree that she said, "The Prince or I must perish."

The Prince de Conde retired to Bourges,--further from Court. The action of an interests, as well
as the prince were obliged by honour, was easily high phenomena when most duc him showed his teeth in
grin. [45] [45] compare Wallace, That the expression, discontent. 120. "Stranger," a half-expressed

  The passions and discontent which reigned then among the
friends of the Prince de Conde ran so high that they were obliged to abandon him and form a
third party, under the authority of the Prince de Conti, in case the Prince accomplished his
reconciliation to the Court, according to a proposition then made to him in the name of the
Duc d'Orleans. I be no vore-- had the use for'ee by grumble, house; nobody do though gettin'up
