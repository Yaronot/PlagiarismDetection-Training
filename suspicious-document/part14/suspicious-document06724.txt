JOHN FORSTER.

A MAN OF LETTERS OF THE OLD SCHOOL.

One of the most robust, striking, and many-sided characters of his time was John Forster, a
rough, uncompromising personage, who, from small and obscure beginnings, shouldered his way
to the front until he came to be looked on by all as guide, friend and arbiter. From a struggling
newspaperman he emerged into handsome chambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields, from thence to a snug
house in Montague Square, ending in a handsome stone mansion which he built for himself at
Palace Gate, Kensington, with its beautiful library-room at the back, and every luxury of "lettered
ease."

If anyone desired to know what Dr. Johnson was like, he could have found him in Forster. There
was the same social intolerance; the same "dispersion of humbug"; the same loud voice, attuned
to a mellifluous softness on occasion, especially with ladies or persons of rank; the love
of "talk" in which he assumed the lead--and kept it too; and the contemptuous scorn of what
he did not approve. But then all this was backed by admirable training and full knowledge.
He was a deeply read, cultivated man, a fine critic, and, with all his arrogance, despotism,
and rough "ways," a most interesting, original, delightful person--for those he liked that
is, and whom he had made his own. His very "build" and appearance was also that of the redoubtable
Doctor: so was his loud and hearty laugh. Woe betide the man on whom he chose to "wipe his
shoes" (Browning's phrase), for he could wipe them with a will. He would thus roar you down.
It was "intol-er-able"--everything was "in-tol-erable!"--it is difficult to describe the fashion
in which he rolled forth the syllables. Other things were "all Stuff!" "Monstrous!" "Incredible!"
"Don't tell me!" Indeed I, with many, could find a parallel in the great old Doctor for almost
everything he said. Even when there was a smile at his vehemence, he would unconsciously repeat
the Doctor's autocratic methods.

Forster's life was indeed a striking and encouraging one for those who believe in the example
of "self-made men." His aim was somewhat different from the worldly types, who set themselves
to become wealthy, or to have lands or mansions. Forster's more moderate aspiration was to
reach to the foremost rank of the literary world: and he succeeded. He secured for himself
an excellent education, never spared himself for study or work, and never rested till he had
built himself that noble mansion at Kensington, of which I have spoken, furnished with books,
pictures, and rare things. Here he could, Mæcenas-like, entertain his literary friends of all
degrees, with a vast number of other friends and acquaintances, notable in their walks of life.
It is astonishing what a circle he had gathered round him, and how intimate he was with all:
political men such as Brougham, Guizot, Gladstone, Forster, Cornwall Lewis (Disraeli he abhorred
as much as his friend of Chelsea did, who once asked me, "What is there new about our Jew Premier?"):
Maclise, Landseer, Frith, and Stanfield, with dozens of other painters: every writer of the
day, almost without exception, late or early. With these, such as Anthony Trollope, he was
on the friendliest terms, though he did not "grapple them to him with hooks of steel." With
the Bar it was the same: he was intimate with the brilliant and agreeable Cockburn; with Lord
Coleridge (then plain Mr. Coleridge), who found a knife and a fork laid for him any day that
he chose to drop in, which he did pretty often. The truth was that in any company his marked
personality, both physical and mental; his magisterial face and loud decided voice, and his
reputation of judge and arbiter, at once impressed and commanded attention. People felt that
they ought to know this personage at once.

It is extraordinary what perseverance and a certain power of will, and that of not being denied,
will do in this way. His broad face and cheeks and burly person were not made for rebuffs.
He seized on persons he wished to know and made them his own at once. I always thought it was
the most characteristic thing known of him in this way, his striding past Bunn the manager--then
his enemy--in his own theatre, taking no notice of him and passing to Macready's room, to confer
with him on measures hostile to the said Bunn. As Johnson was said to toss and gore his company,
so Forster trampled on those he condemned. I remember he had a special dislike to one of Boz's
useful henchmen. An amusing story was told, that after some meeting to arrange matters with
Bradbury and Evans, the printers, Boz, ever charitable, was glad to report to Forster some
hearty praise by this person, of the ability with which he (Forster) had arranged the matters,
thus amiably wishing to propitiate the autocrat in his friend's interest. But, said the uncompromising
Forster, "I am truly sorry, my dear Dickens, that I cannot reciprocate your friend's compliment,
for a d----nder ass I never encountered in the whole course of my life!" A comparative that
is novel and will be admired.

Forster had a determined way with him, of forcing an answer that he wanted; driving you into
a corner as it were. A capital illustration of this power occurred in my case. I had sent to
a London "second hand" bookseller to supply me with a copy of the two quarto volumes of Garrick's
life, "huge armfuls." It was with some surprise that I noted the late owner's name and book-plate,
which was that of "John Forster, Esq., Lincoln's Inn Fields." At the moment he had given me
Garrick's original MS. correspondence, of which he had a score of volumes, and was helping
me in many other ways. Now it was a curious coincidence that this one, of all existing copies,
should come to me. Next time I saw him I told him of it. He knitted his brows and grew thoughtful.
"My copy! Ah! I can account for it! It was one of the volumes I lent to that fellow"--mentioning
the name of the "fellow"--"he no doubt sold it for drink!" "Oh, so that was it," I said rather
incautiously. "But you," he said sternly, "tell me what did you think when you saw my name?
Come now! How did it leave my library?" This was awkward to answer. "I suppose you thought
I was in the habit of selling my books? Surely not?" Now this was what I had thought. "Come!
You must have had some view on the matter. Two huge volumes like that are not easily stolen."
It was with extraordinary difficulty that I could extricate myself.

It was something to talk to one who had been intimate with Charles Lamb, and of whom he once
spoke to me, with tears running down his cheeks, "Ah! poor dear Charles Lamb!" The next day
he had summoned his faithful clerk, instructing him to look out among his papers--such was
his way--for all the Lamb letters, which were then lent to me. And most interesting they were.
In one, Elia calls him "Fooster," I fancy taking off Carlyle's pronunciation.

As a writer and critic Forster held a high, unquestioned place, his work being always received
with respect as of one of the masters. He had based his style on the admirable, if somewhat
old-fashioned models, had regularly learned to write, which few do now, by studying the older
writers: Swift, Addison, and, above all, the classics.

He was at first glad to do "job work," and was employed by Dr. Lardner to furnish the "Statesmen
of the Commonwealth" to his Encyclopædia. Lardner received from him a conscientious bit of
work, but which was rather dry reading, something after the pattern of Dr. Lingard, who was
then in fashion. But presently he was writing con amore, a book after his own heart, The Life
and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith, in which there is a light, gay touch, somewhat peculiar
at times, but still very agreeable. It is a charming book, and graced with exquisite sketches
by his friend Maclise and other artists. There was a great deal of study and "reading" in it,
which engendered an angry controversy with Sir James Prior, a ponderous but pains-taking writer,
who had collected every scrap that was connected with Goldy. Forster, charged with helping
himself to what another had gathered, sternly replied, as if it could not be disputed, that
he had merely gone to the same common sources as Prior, and had found what he had found! But
this was seasoned with extraordinary abuse of poor Prior, who was held up as an impostor for
being so industrious. Nothing better illustrated Forster's way: "The fellow was preposterous--intolerable.
I had just as good a right to go to the old magazines as he had." It was, indeed, a most amusing
and characteristic controversy.

At this time the intimacy between Boz and the young writer--two young men, for they were only
thirty-six--was of the closest. Dickens' admiration of his friend's book was unbounded. He
read it with delight and expressed his admiration with an affectionate enthusiasm. The another
congratulate a creator; a the at very inquire him to come and any with she. Mr. pinchfip wished
to cognize if he was related to his Légume whom he had meet at Forster Paris. Mr. Car Brick told
him he would bring his friend Livingston round to bargain pinchfip
calm.

It wanted the fire and dash of Légume'element picture, but its truthfulness
to life formerly made an feeling on Great-uncle Bill.

    Mr. Van Brick gave the artist his wag,
      and shook hands with him:... and the
      official were passing away, when légume asked
    them to take one match leer at the abstraction

Browne's'money to Monsieur Légume on this score.''we will have to make the precedent, immediately,'talk
Bookmobile Brick,'and do it too, if we find that he deserves the money.
But time flies, and we have the good artists to visit.'they next
went to Bagswell's studio, in the Viccolo dei Greci, and found him
in a room, legally furnished, and having a solidly finished look;
the walls decorate with paintings, sketches, costumes, lad; while
in a light under its one large clerestory, was his painting.

They establish he had left his interior track of
large subjects, and in the school had an good of an inn-- a kitchen-presence.

It represented the wrong stout, small country girl, in Ciociara'masquerade, kneading pinchfip long
swale of dough, while former girl was filling pans with that which
was already beaten, and two or three large females were carrying them

The painting was nearly life-like inflame, and for most time employed on it, again fit. Mr. go a
state that it would afford him pleasure to call evidently.

Stuck on with the sketching-assemble herself to one corner was a piece of paper, on which was
marked the numerousness of hours employed each day on latter work; it summed down fifty-four
hours, or start an other each character of very eight hours'work on it herself.
 What a genuine affectionate ring is here!

Later Forster lost this agreeable touch, and issued a series of ponderous historical treatises,
enlargements of his old "Statesmen." These were dreary things, pedantic, solemn and heavy;
they might have been by the worthy Rollin himself. Such was the Life of Sir John Eliot, the
Arrest of the Five Members, and others.

No one had been so intimate with Savage Landor as he had, or admired him more. He had known
him for years and was chosen as his literary executor. With such materials one might have looked
for a lively, vivacious account of this tempestuous personage. But Forster dealt with him in
his magisterial way, and furnished a heavy treatise, on critical and historical principles.
Everything here is treated according to the strict canons and in judicial fashion. On every
poem there was a long and profound criticism of many pages, which I believe was one of his
own old essays used again, fitted into the book. The hero is treated as though he were some
important historical personage. Everyone knew Landor's story; his shocking violences and lack
of restraint; his malignity where he disliked. His life was full of painful episodes, but Forster,
like Podsnap, would see none of these things. He waved them away with his "monstrous!" "intolerable!"
and put them out of existence.

According to him, not a word of the scandals was true. Landor was a noble-hearted man; misjudged,
and carried away by his feelings. The pity of it was he could have made of it a most lasting,
entertaining book had he brought to it the pleasantly light touch he was later to bring to
his account of Dickens. But he took it all too solemnly. Landor's life was full of grotesque
scenes, and Forster might have alleviated the harsh views taken of his friend by dealing with
him as an impetuous, irresponsible being, amusing even in his delinquencies. Boz gave a far
juster view of him in Boythorn. In almost the year of his death Forster began another tremendous
work, The Life of Swift, for which he had been preparing and collecting for many years. No
one was so fitted by profound knowledge of the period. He had much valuable MS. material, but
the first volume, all he lived to finish, was leaden enough. Of course he was writing with
disease weighing him down, with nights that were sleepless and spent in general misery. But
even with all allowance it was a dull and conventional thing.

It has been often noted how a mere trifle will, in an extraordinary way, determine or change
the whole course of a life. I can illustrate this by my own case. I was plodding on contentedly
at the Bar without getting "no forrarder," with slender meagre prospects, but with a hankering
after "writing," when I came to read this Life of Goldsmith that I have just been describing,
which filled me with admiration. The author was at the moment gathering materials for his Life
of Swift, when it occurred to me that I might be useful to him in getting up all the local
Swiftian relics, traditions, etc. I set to work, obtained them, made the sketches, and sent
them to him in a batch. He was supremely grateful, and never forgot the volunteered trifling
service. To it I owe a host of literary friends and acquaintance with the "great guns," Dickens,
Carlyle, and the rest; and when I ventured to try my prentice pen, it was Forster who took
personal charge of the venture. It was long remembered at the Household Words office how he
stalked in one morning, stick in hand, and, flinging down the paper, called out, "Now, mind,
no nonsense about it, no humbug, no returning it with a polite circular, and all that; see
that it is read and duly considered." That was the turning-point. To that blunt declaration
I owe some forty years of enjoyment and employment--for there is no enjoyment like that of
writing--to say nothing of money in abundance.

He once paid a visit to Dublin, when we had many an agreeable expedition to Swift's haunts,
which, from the incuriousness of the place at the time, were still existing. We went to Hoey's
Court in "The Liberties," a squalid alley with a few ruined houses, among which was the one
in which Swift was born. Thence to St. Patrick's, to Marsh's Library, not then rebuilt, where
he turned over with infinite interest Swift's well-noted folios. Then on to Trinity College,
where there was much that was curious; to Swift's Hospital, where, from his office in the Lunacy
Commission, he was quite at home. He at once characteristically assumed the air of command,
introducing himself with grave dignity to the authorities, by-and-bye pointing out matters
which might be amended, among others the bareness of the walls, which were without pictures. Yes,
i tell you the people experience the depth and sacredness of this war; they feel it to be, as
Carlyle said of the Revolution,'truth, though a truth clad in hell-fire.'then forward, noble friend
of the broad and true! There are some who are written upon God's did not muster-scroll as martyrs
to autonomy. Who would not esteem he a happiness and a glory to belong to this Guard, who from
age to age have rallied and rallied and rallied to the support liberty, to the rescue on this continuous
sepulchre from the hands of desolators and barbarians, who have forever fought where the fight
was thickest, have ever been the advance-guard of the world in its late progress, and been enshrined
down in the heart of the works, there to glow like the stars forward and ever? Is it received a hardship
to die that one may live well? Is it a hardship to die that millions who now live in wailing
and woe, in localities and degradation, may live in happiness freedom in all time to come? The
voice of the army of American freemen rolls back while the answer, like no anthem of the sea, the!
the onward, deep no, which re-echo were from the great Atlantic to the sunset-dyed Pacific,
from the summits of Nevada to the great lakes of a Union. He can
not think but that their lives are again spend.

Rally
and always, and forward forever, until every Malakoff of wrong is reduced, and every suffering lucknow
of our country hears the slogan deliverance. You have glorious successes to cheer you would now.
 "My dear Whiteside, how
can you say so? Do you not see that by saying such a thing you give yourself away?" etc.

Forster, however, more than redeemed himself when he issued his well-known Life of Dickens,
a work that was a perfect delight to the world and to his friends. For here is the proper lightness
of touch. The complete familiarity with every detail of the course of the man of whose life
his had been a portion, and the quiet air of authority which he could assume in consequence,
gave the work an attraction that was beyond dispute. There have been, it is said, some fifteen
or sixteen official Lives issued since the writer's death; but all these are written "from
outside" as it were, and it is extraordinary what a different man each presents. But hardly
sufficient credit has been given to him for the finished style which only a true and well trained
critic could have brought, the easy touch, the appropriate treatment of trifles, the mere indication
as it were, the correct passing by or sliding over of matters that should not be touched. All
this imparted a dignity of treatment, and though familiar, the whole was gay and bright. True,
occasionally he lapsed into his favourite pompousness and autocracy, but this made the work
more characteristic of the man. Nothing could have been in better taste than his treatment
of certain passages in the author's life as to which, he showed, the public were not entitled
to demand more than the mere historical mention of the facts. When he was writing this Life
it was amusing to find how sturdily independent he became. The "Blacking episode" could not
have been acceptable, but Forster was stern and would not bate a line. So, with much more--he
"rubbed it in" without scruple. The true reason, by the way, of the uproar raised against the
writer, was that it was too much of a close borough, no one but Boz and his Bear leader being
allowed upon the stage. Numbers had their little letters from the great man with many compliments
and favours which would look well in print. Many, like Wilkie Collins or Edmund Yates, had
a whole collection. I myself had some sixty or seventy. Some of these personages were highly
indignant, for were they not characters in the drama? When the family came to publish the collection
of letters, Yates, I believe, declined to allow his to be printed; so did Collins, whose Boz
letters were later sold and published in America.

No doubt the subject inspired. The ever gay and lively Boz, always in spirits, called up many
a happy scene, and gave the pen a certain airiness and nimbleness. There is little that is
official or magisterial about the volumes. Everything is pleasant and interesting, put together--though
there is a crowd of details--with extraordinary art and finish. It furnishes a most truthful
and accurate picture of the "inimitable," recognizable in every page. It was only in the third
volume, when scared by the persistent clamours of the disappointed and the envious, protesting
that there was "too much Forster," that it was virtually a "Life of John Forster, with some
recollections of Charles Dickens," that he became of a sudden, official and allowed others
to come too much on the scene, with much loss of effect. That third volume, which ought to
have been most interesting, is the dull one. We have Boz described as he would be in an encyclopædia,
instead of through Forster, acting as his interpreter, and much was lost by this treatment.
Considering the homeliness and every-day character of the incidents, it is astonishing how
Forster contrived to dignify them. He knew from early training what was valuable and significant
and what should be rejected.

Granting the objections--and faults--of the book, it may be asked, who else in the 'seventies
was, not so fitted, but fitted at all to produce a Life of Dickens. Every eye looked, every
finger pointed to Forster; worker, patron, and disciple, confidant, adviser, correcter, admirer,
the trained man of letters, and in the school in which Boz had been trained, who had known
every one of that era. No one else could have been thought of. And as we now read the book,
and contrast it with those ordered or commissioned biographies, so common now, and perhaps
better wrought, we see at once the difference. The success was extraordinary. Edition after
edition was issued, and that so rapidly, that the author had no opportunity of making the necessary
corrections, or of adding new information. He contented himself with a leaf or two at the end,
in which, in his own imperial style, he simply took note of the information. I believe his
profit was about £10,000.

A wonderful feature was the extraordinary amount of Dickens' letters that was worked into it.
To save time and trouble, and this I was told by Mrs. Forster, he would cut out the passages
he wanted with a pair of scissors and paste them on his MS! As the portion written on the back
was thus lost, the rest became valueless. I can fancy the American collector tearing his hair
as he reads of this desecration. But it was a rash act and a terrible loss of money. Each letter
might have later been worth say from five to ten pounds apiece.

It would be difficult to give an idea of Forster's overflowing kindness on the occasion of
the coming of friends to town. Perpetual hospitality was the order of the day, and, like so
many older Londoners, he took special delight in hearing accounts of the strange out-of-the-way
things a visitor will discover, and with which he will even surprise the resident. He enjoyed
what he called "hearing your adventures." I never met anyone with so boisterous and enjoying
a laugh. Something would tickle him, and, like Johnson in Fleet Street, he would roar and roar
again. Like Diggory, too, at the same story, or rather scene; for, like his friend Boz, it
was the picture of some humorous incident that delighted, and would set him off into convulsions.
One narrative of my own, a description of the recitation of Poe's The Bells by an actress,
in which she simulated the action of pulling the bell for the Fire, or for a Wedding or Funeral
bells, used to send him into perfect hysterics. And I must say that I, who have seen and heard
all sorts of truly humorous and spuriously humorous stories in which the world abounds at the
present moment, have never witnessed anything more diverting. The poor lady thought she was
doing the thing realistically, while the audience was shrieking with enjoyment. I do not know
how many times I was invited to repeat this narrative, a somewhat awkward situation for me,
but I was glad always to do what he wished. I recall Browning coming in, and I was called on
to rehearse this story, Forster rolling on the sofa in agonies of enjoyment. This will seem
trivial and personal, but really it was characteristic; and pleasant it was to find a man of
his sort so natural and even boyish.

At the head of his table, with a number of agreeable and clever guests around him, Forster
was at his best. He seemed altogether changed. Beaming smiles, a gentle, encouraging voice,
and a tenderness verging on gallantry to the ladies, took the place of the old, rough fashions.
He talked ostentatiously, he led the talk, told most à propos anecdotes of the remarkable men
he had met, and was fond of fortifying his own views by adding: "As Gladstone, or Guizot, or
Palmerston said to me in my room," etc. But you could not but be struck by the finished shapes
in which his sentences ran. There was a weight, a power of illustration, and a dramatic colouring
that could only have come of long practice. He was gay, sarcastic, humorous, and it was impossible
not to recognise that here was a clever man and a man of power.

Forster's ideal of hospitality was not reciprocity, but was bounded by his entertaining everybody.
Not that he did not enjoy a friendly quiet dinner at your table. Was he on his travels at a
strange place? You must dine with him at his hotel. In town you must dine with him. He might
dine with you. This dining with you must be according to his programme. When he was in the
vein and inclined for a social domestic night he would let himself out.

Maclise's happy power of realising character is shown inimitably in the picture of Forster
at the reading of The Christmas Carol, seated forward in his chair, with a solemn air of grave
judgment. There is an air of distrust, or of being on his guard, as who should say, "It is
fine, very fine, but I hold my opinion in suspense till the close. I am not to be caught as
you are, by mere flowers." He was in fact distinct from the rest, all under the influence of
emotion. Harness is shown weeping, Jerrold softened, etc. These rooms, as is well known, were
Mr. Tulkinghorn's in the novel, and over Forster's head, as he wrote, was the floridly-painted
ceiling, after the fashion of Verrio, with the Roman pointing. This was effaced many years
ago, but I do not know when.

By all his friends Forster was thought of as a sort of permanent bachelor. His configuration
and air were entirely suited to life in chambers: he was thoroughly literary; his friends were
literary; there he gave his dinners; married life with him was inconceivable. He had lately
secured an important official post, that of Secretary to the Lunacy Commissioners, which he
gained owing to his useful services when editing the Examiner. This necessarily led to the
Commissionership, which was worth a good deal more. Nowadays we do not find the editors of
the smaller papers securing such prizes. I remember when he was encouraging me to "push my
way," he illustrated his advice by his own example: "I never let old Brougham go. I came back
again and again until I wore him out. I forced 'em to give me this." I could quite imagine
it. Forster was a troublesome customer, "a harbitrary cove," and not to be put off, except
for a time. It was an excellent business appointment, and he was admitted to be an admirable
official.

In one of Dickens' letters, published by his children, there is a grotesque outburst at some
astounding piece of news: an event impending, which seemed to have taken his breath away. It
clearly refers to his friend's marriage. This pleasantly boisterous humour is in no wise exaggerated.
I fancy it affected all Forster's friends much in the same way, and as an exquisitely funny
and expected thing. How many pictures did Boz see before him--Forster proposing to the widow
in his sweetest accents, his deportment at the church, &c. There was not much sentiment in
the business, though the bride was a sweet, charming woman, as will be seen, too gentle for
that tempestuous spirit. She was a widow--"Yes, gentlemen, the plaintiff is a widow," widow
of Colburn, the publisher, a quiet little man, who worshipped her. She was well endowed, inheriting
much of his property, even to his papers, etc. She had also a most comfortable house in Montague
Square, where, as the saying is, Forster had only to move in and "hang up his hat."

With all his roughness and bluntness, Forster had a very soft heart, and was a great appreciator
of the sex. He had some little "affairs of the heart," which, however, led to no result. He
was actually engaged to the interesting L. E. L. (Letitia Landon), whom he had no doubt pushed
well forward in the Examiner; for the fair poetess generally contrived to enlist the affections
of her editors, as she did those of Jerdan, director of the once powerful Literary Gazette.
We can see from his Memoirs how attracted he was by her. The engagement was broken off, it
is believed, through the arts of Dr. Maginn, and it is said that Forster behaved exceedingly
well in the transaction. Later he became attached to another lady, who had several suitors
of distinction, but she was not disposed to entrust herself to him.

No one so heartily relished his Forster, his ways and oddities, as Boz; albeit the sage was
his faithful friend, counsellor, and ally. He had an exquisite sense for touches of character,
especially for the little weaknesses so often exhibited by sturdy, boisterous natures. We again
recall that disposition of Johnson, with his "bow to an Archbishop," listening with entranced
attention to a dull story told by a foreign "diplomatist." "The ambassador says well," would
the sage repeat many times, which, as Bozzy tells, became a favourite form in the côterie for
ironical approbation. There was much of this in our great man, whose voice became of the sweetest
and most mellifluous key, as he bent before the peer. "Lord ----," he would add gently, and
turning to the company, "has been saying, with much force," etc.

I recall the Guild fête down at Knebworth, where Forster was on a visit to its noble owner,
Lord Lytton, and was deputed to receive and marshal the guests at the station, an office of
dread importance, and large writ over his rather burly person. His face was momentous as he
patrolled the platform. I remember coming up to him in the crowd, but he looked over and beyond
me, big with unutterable things. Mentioning this later to Boz, he laughed his cheerful laugh,
"Exactly," he cried. "Why, I assure you, Forster would not see me!" He was busy pointing out
the vehicles, the proper persons to sit in them, according to their dignity. All through that
delightful day, as I roamed through the fine old halls, I would encounter him passing by, still
in his lofty dream, still controlling all, with a weight of delegated authority on his broad
shoulders. Only at the very close did he vouchsafe a few dignified, encouraging words, and
then passed on. He reminded me much of Elia's description of Bensley's Malvolio.

There was nothing ill-natured in Boz's relish of these things; he heartily loved his friend.
It was the pure love of fun. Podsnap has many touches of Forster, but the writer dared not
let himself go in that character as he would have longed to do. It may be thought that Boz
would not be so daring as to introduce his friend into his stories, "under his very nose" as
it were, submitting the proofs, etc., with the certainty that the portrait would be recognised.
But this, as we know, is the last thing that could have occurred, or the last thing that would
have occurred to Forster. It was like enough someone else, but not he.

"Mr. Podsnap was well to do, and stood very high in Mr. Podsnap's opinion." "Mr. Podsnap settled
that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence." "I don't want to know about it. I
don't desire to discover it." "He had, however, acquired a peculiar flourish of his right arm
in the clearing the world of its difficulties."

These touches any friend of Forster's would recognise. He could be very engaging, and was at
his best when enjoying what he called a shoemaker's holiday--that is, when away from town at
some watering-place, with friends. He was then really delightful, because happy, having left
all his solemnities and ways in London.

Forster was a man of many gifts, an admirable hard-working official, thoroughly business-like
and industrious. I recall him through all the stages of his connection with the Lunacy Department,
as Secretary and Commissioner and Retired Commissioner, when he would arrive on "melting days"
as it were. But it was as a cultured critic that he was unsurpassed. He was ever "correct,"
and delivered a judgment that commended itself on the instant; it was given with such weight
and persuasion. This correctness of judgment extended to most things, politics, character,
literature, and was pleasant to listen to. He was one of the old well-read school, and was
never without his edition of Shakespeare, the Globe one, which he took with him on his journeys.
He had a way of lightly emphasising the beauty of a special passage of the Bard's.

Once, travelling round with Boz, on one of his reading tours, we came to Belfast, where the
huge Ulster Hall was filled to the door by ardent and enthusiastic Northerners. I recall how
we walked round the rather grim town, with its harsh red streets, the honest workers staring
at him hard. We put up at an old-fashioned hotel, the best--the Royal it was called, where
there was much curiosity on the part of the ladies to get sly peeps at the eminent man. They
generally contrived to be on the stairs when he emerged. Boz always appeared, even in the streets,
somewhat carefully "made up." The velvet collar, the blue coat, the heavy gold pin, added to
the effect.

It was at this hotel, when the show was over, and our agreeable supper cleared away, that I
saw the pleasant Boz lying on the sofa somewhat tired by his exertions, not so much on the
boards as in that very room. For he was fond of certain parlour gymnastics, in which he contended
with his aide-de-camp Dolby. Well, as I said, he was on his sofa somewhat fatigued with his
night's work, in a most placid, enjoying frame of mind, laughing with his twinkling eyes, as
he often did, squeezing and puckering them up when our talk fell on Forster, whom he was in
the vein for enjoying. It had so fallen out that, only a few weeks before, Trinity College,
Dublin, had invited Forster to receive an honorary degree, a compliment that much gratified
him. I was living there at the time, and he came and stayed with me in the best of humours,
thoroughly enjoying it all. Boz, learning that I had been with him, insisted on my telling
him everything, as by instinct he knew that his friend would have been at his best. The scenes
we passed through together were indeed of the richest comedy. First I see him in highest spirits
trying on a doctor's scarlet robe, to be had on hire. On this day he did everything in state,
in his special "high" manner. Thus he addressed the tailor in rolling periods: "Sir, the University
has been good enough to confer a degree on me, and I have come over to receive it. My name
is John Forster." (I doubt if his name had reached the tailor). "Certainly, sir." And my friend
was duly invested with the robe. He walked up and down before a pier glass. "Hey, what now?
Do you know, my dear friend, I really think I must buy this dress. It would do very well to
go to Court in, hey?" He indulged his fancy. "Why I could wear it on many occasions. A most
effective dress." But it was time now to wait on "the senior Bursar," or some such functionary.
This was one Doctor L----, a rough, even uncouth, old don, who was for the nonce holding a
sort of rude class, surrounded by a crowd of "undergrads." Never shall I forget that scene.
Forster went forward, with a mixture of gracious dignity and softness, and was beginning, "Doc-tor
L----." Here the turbulent boys round him interrupted. "Now see here," said the irate Bursar,
"it's no use all of ye's talking together. Sir, I can't attend to you now." Again Forster began
with a gracious bow. "Doctor L----, I have come over at the invitation of the University, who
have been good enough to offer me an honorary degree, and--"

"Now see here," said the doctor, "there's no use talking to me now. I can't attend to ye. All
of ye come back here in an hour and take the oath, all together mind."

"I merely wished to state, Doctor L----," began the wondering Forster.

"Sir I tell ye I can't attend to ye now. You must come again," and he was gone.

I was at the back of the room, when my friend joined me, very ruminative and serious. "Very
odd, all this," he said, "but I suppose when we do come back, it will be all right?"

"Oh yes, he is noted as an odd man," I said.

"I don't at all understand him, but I suppose it is all right. Well come along, my dear friend."
I then left him for a while. After the hour's interval I returned. The next thing I saw from
the back of the room was my burly friend in the front row of a number of irreverent youngsters
of juvenile age, some of whom close by me were saying, "Who's the stout old bloke; what's he
doing here?"

"Now," said the Bursar and senior fellow, "take these Testaments on your hands, all o' ye."
And then I saw my venerable friend, for so he looked in comparison, with three youths sharing
his Testament with them. But he was serious. For here was a most solemn duty before him. "Now
repeat after me. Ego," a shout, "Joannes, Carolus," as the case might be "juro solemniter,"
&c. Forster might have been in church going through a marriage ceremony, so reverently did
he repeat the formula. The lads were making a joke of it.

Forster, as I said, was indeed a man of the old fashion of gallantry, making his approaches
where he admired sans cérémonie, and advancing boldly to capture the fort. I remember a dinner,
with a young lady who had a lovely voice, and who sang after the dinner to the general admiration.
Forster had never seen her before, but when she was pressed to sing again and again, and refused
positively, I was amazed to see Forster triumphantly passing through the crowded room, the
fair one on his arm, he patting one of her small hands which he held in his own! She was flattered
immensely and unresisting; the gallant Foster had carried all before him. This was his way,
never would he be second fiddle anywhere if he could help it. Not a bad principle for any one
if they can only manage it.

I remember one night, when he was in his gallant mood laying his commands on a group of ladies,
to sing or do something agreeable, he broke out: "You know I am a despot, and must have my
way, I'm such a harbitrary cove." The dames stared at this speech, and I fancy took it literally,
for they had not heard the story. This I fancy did not quite please, for he had no notion of
its being supposed he considered himself arbitrary; so he repeated and enforced the words in
a loud stern voice. (Boswellians will recall the scene where Johnson said "The woman had a
bottom of sense." When the ladies began to titter, he looked round sternly saying "Where's
the merriment? I repeat the woman is fundamentally sensible." As who should say "now laugh
if you dare!") The story referred to was that of the cabman who summoned Forster for giving
him a too strictly measured fare, and when defeated, said "it warn't the fare, but he was determined
to bring him there for he were such a harbitrary cove." No story about Forster gave such delight
to his friends as this; he himself was half flattered, half annoyed.

Forster liked to be with people of high degree--as, perhaps, most of us do. At one time he
was infinitely flattered by the attentions of Count Dorsay, who, no doubt, considered him a
personage. This odd combination was the cause of great amusement to his friends, who were,
of course, on the look out for droll incidents. There was many a story in circulation. One
was that Forster, expecting a promised visit from "the Count," received a sudden call from
his printers. With all solemnity he impressed the situation on his man. "Now," he said, "you
will tell the Count that I have only just gone round to call on Messrs. Spottiswoode, the printers--you
will observe, Messrs. Spot-is-wode," added he, articulating the words in his impressive way.
The next time Forster met the Count, the former gravely began to explain to him the reason
of his absence. "Ah! I know," said the gay Count, "you had just gone round to Ze Spotted Dog--I
understand," as though he could make allowance for the ways of literary men. Once Forster had
the Count to dinner--a great solemnity. When the fish was "on" the host was troubled to note
that the sauce had not yet reached his guest. In an agitated deep sotto voce, he said, "Sauce
to the Count." The "aside" was unheard. He repeated it in louder, but more agitated tones,
"Sauce to the Count." This, too, was unnoticed; when, louder still, the guests heard, "Sauce
for the Flounders of the Count." This gave infinite delight to the friends, and the phrase
became almost a proverb. Forster learning to dance in secret, in preparation for some festivity,
was another enjoyment, and his appearance on the scene, carefully executing the steps, his
hands on the shoulders of a little girl, caused much hilarity.

All this is amusing in the same way as it was amusing to Boz, as a capital illustration of
character, genuinely exhibited, and yet it is with the greatest sympathy and affection I recall
these things: but they were too enjoyable. There is nothing depreciating, no more than there
was in Bozzy's record, who so amiably puts forward the pleasant weaknesses of his hero. Though
twenty years and more have elapsed since he passed from this London of ours, there is nothing
I think of with more pleasure and affection than those far-off scenes in which he figured so
large and strong, supplying dramatic action, character, and general enjoyment. The figures
of our day seem to me to be small, thin and cardboard-like in comparison.

Boz himself is altogether mixed up with Forster's image, and it is difficult to think of one
without recalling the other. In this connection there comes back on me a pleasant comedy scene,
in which the former figured, and which, even at this long distance of time, raises a smile.
When I had come to town, having taken a house, etc., with a young and pretty wife, Dickens
looked on encouragingly; but at times shaking his head humorously, as the too sanguine plans
were broached: "Ah, the little victims play," he would quote. Early in the venture he good-naturedly
came to dine en famille with his amiable and interesting sister-in-law. He was in a delightful
mood, and seemed to be applying all the points of his own Dora's attempts at housekeeping,
with a pleasant slyness: the more so as the little lady of the house was the very replica of
that piquant and fascinating heroine. She was destined, alas! to but a short enjoyment of her
little rule, but she gained all hearts and sympathies by her very taking ways. Among others
the redoubtable John Forster professed to be completely "captured," and was her most obstreperous
slave. He, too, was to have been of the party, but was prevented by one of his troublesome
chest attacks. Scarcely had Boz entered when he drew out a letter, I see him now standing at
the fire, a twinkle in his brilliant eyes. "What is coming over Forster," he said, ruminating,
"I cannot make him out. Just as I was leaving the house I received this," and he read aloud,
"I can't join you to-day. But mark you this, sir! no tampering, no poaching on my grounds;
for I won't have it. Recollect Codlin's the friend not Short!" With a wondering look Boz kept
repeating in a low voice: "'Codlin's the friend not Short.' What can he mean? What do you make
of it?" I knew perfectly, as did also the little lady who stood there smiling and flattered,
but it was awkward to explain. But he played with the thing; and it could only be agreed that
Forster at times was perfectly "amazing," or "a little off his head."

And what a dinner it was! What an amusing failure, too, as a first attempt; suddenly, towards
the end of the dinner, a loud, strange sound was heard, as of falling or rushing waters; it
was truly alarming; I ran out and found a full tide streaming down the stairs. The cook in
her engrossment had forgotten to turn a cock. "Ah, the little victims play!" and Boz's eyes
twinkled. A loud-voiced cuckoo and quail were sounding their notes, which prompted me to describe
a wonderful clock of the kind I had seen, with two trumpeters who issued forth at the hour
and gave a prolonged flourish before striking, then retired, their doors closing with a smart
clap. This set off Boz in his most humorous vein. He imagined the door sticking fast, or only
half-opening, the poor trumpeter behind pushing with his shoulder to get out, then giving a
feeble gasping tootle with much "whirring" and internal agonies; then the rest is silence.

On another occasion came Forster himself and lady, for a little family dinner; the same cook
insisted on having in her husband, "a dear broth of a boy," to assist her. Forster arriving
before he was expected, he was ever more than punctual; the tailor rushed up eagerly to admit
him, forgetting, however, to put on his coat! As he threw open the door he must have been astonished
at Forster's greeting "No, no, my good friend, I altogether decline. I am not your match in
age, weight, or size," a touch of his pleasant humour and good spirits.

As of course Forster deeply felt the death of his old friend and comrade, the amiable and constant
Dickens, he was the great central figure in all the dismal ceremonial that followed. He arranged
everything admirably, he was executor with Miss Hogarth, and I could not but think how exactly
he reproduced his great prototype, Johnson, in a similar situation. Bozzy describes the activity
and fuss of the sage hurrying about with a pen in his hand and dealing with the effects: "We
are not here," he said, "to take account of a number of vats, &c., but of the potentiality
of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice." So was Forster busy, appraising copyrights,
and realizing assets, all which work he performed in a most business-like fashion. That bequest
in the will of the gold watch, to his "trusty friend, John Forster," I always thought admirably
summarized the relations of the two friends. I myself received under his will one of his ivory
paper-knives, and a paper-weight marked C.D. in golden letters, which was made for and presented
to him at one of the pottery works.

One of the most delightful little dinners I had was an impromptu one at Forster's house, the
party being himself, myself, and Boz. The presence of a third, not a stranger yet not an intimate,
prompted both to be more free than had they been tête-à-tête. Boz was what might best be called
"gay." His fashion of talk was to present things that happened in a pleasantly humorous light.
On this occasion he told us a good deal about a strange being, Chauncey Hare Towns-bend, from
whom he may have drawn Twemlow in Our Mutual Friend. Every look in that sketch reminds me of
him; he, too, had a shy shrinking manner, a soft voice, but, in his appearance most of all,
was Twemlow; he had a rather over-done worship of Dickens, wishing "not to intrude," etc.;
he was a delicate, unhealthy looking person, rather carefully made up. Boz was specially pleasant
this day on an odd bequest of his; for poor Twemlow had died, and he, Boz, was implored to
edit his religious writings: rather a compendium of his religious opinions to be collected
from a mass of papers in a trunk. For which service £1,000 was bequeathed. Boz was very humorous
on his first despair at being appointed to such an office; then described his hopeless attempts
"to make head or tail" of the papers. "Are they worth anything as religious views?" I asked.
"Nothing whatever, I should say," he said, with a humorous twinkle in his eye, "I must only
piece them together somehow." And so he did, I forget under what title, I think Religious Remains
of the late C. H. T. There was probably some joking on this description. It is fair to say
that Boz had to put up with a vast deal of this admiring worship, generally from retiring creatures
whom his delicate good-nature would not let him offend.

Forster's large sincerity was remarkable, as was his generous style, which often carried him
to extraordinary lengths. They were such as one would only find in books. I remember once coming
to London without giving him due notice, which he always imperatively required to be done.
When I went off to his house at Palace Gate, presenting myself about five o'clock, he was delighted
to see me, as he always was, but I saw he was very uncomfortable and distressed. "Why didn't
you tell me," he said testily, "a day or two ago would have done. But now, my dear fellow,
the table's full--it's impossible." "What?" I asked, yet not without a suspicion of the truth--for
I knew him. "Why, I have a dinner party to-day! De Mussy, the Doctor of the Orleans family,
and some others are coming, and here you arrive at this hour! Just look at the clock--I tell
you it can't be done." In vain I protested; though I could not say it was "no matter," for
it was a serious business. "Come with me into the dining-room and you'll see for yourself."
There we went round the table, and "The table's full," he repeated from Macbeth. There was
something truly original in the implied premise that his friend was entitled of right to have
a place at his table, and that the sole dispensing cause to be allowed was absence of space
or a physical impossibility. It seems to me that this was a very genuine, if rare, shape of
hospitality.

Of all Forster's friends at this time, of course, after Dickens, and he had innumerable ones,
his fastest seemed Robert Browning. As every Sunday came round it was a rule that the Poet
was to dine with him. Many were the engagements his host declined on the score of this standing
engagement. "Should be delighted, my dear friend, to go to you, but it is an immemorial custom
that every Sunday Robert Browning dines with me. Nothing interferes with that." Often, indeed,
during the week the Poet would drop in for a chat or consultation, often when I was there.
He was a most agreeable person, without any affectation; while Forster maintained a sort of
patriarchal or paternal manner to him, though there was not much difference in their ages.
Indeed, on this point, Forster well illustrated what has been often said of Mr. Pickwick and
his time, that age has been much "put back" since that era. Mr. Pickwick, Wardle, Tupman and
Co., are all described as old gentlemen, none of the party being over fifty; but they had to
dress up to the part of old gentlemen, and with the aid of corpulence, "circular spectacles,"
&c, conveyed the idea of seventy. Forster in the same way was then not more than forty-five,
but had a full-blown official look, and with his grave, solemn utterances, you would have set
him down for sixty. Now-a-days men of that age, if in sound order, feel, behave, and dress
as men of forty. Your real old man does not begin till he is about seventy-five or so.

Browning having an acquaintance that was both "extensive and peculiar," could retail much gossip
and always brought plenty of news with him: to hear which Forster did seriously incline. The
Poet, too, had a pleasant flavour of irony or cynicism in his talk, but nothing ill-natured.
What a pleasant Sunday that was when Frederick Chapman, the publisher, invited me and Forster,
and Browning, with one or two more, whose names I have forgotten, down to Teddington. It was
the close of a sultry summer's day, we had a cool and enjoyable repast, with many a joke and
retailed story. Thus, "I was stopped to-day," said Browning, "by a strange, dilapidated being.
Who do you think it was? After a moment, it took the shape of old Harrison Ainsworth." "A strange,
dilapidated being," repeated Forster, musingly, "so the man is alive." Then both fell into
reminiscences of grotesque traits, &c. This affectionate intercourse long continued. But alas!
this compulsory Sunday dining, as the philosopher knows, became at last a sore strain, and
a mistake. It must come to Goldsmith's "travelling over one's mind," with power to travel no
farther. Browning, too, had been "found out by Society"; was the guest at noble houses, and
I suppose became somewhat lofty in his views. No one could scoff so loudly and violently as
could Forster, at what is called snobbishness, "toadying the great"; though it was a little
weakness of his own, and is indeed of everybody. However, on some recent visit, I learned to
my astonishment, that a complete breach had taken place between the attached friends, who were
now "at daggers drawn," as it is called. The story went, as told, I think, by Browning, who
would begin: "I grew tired of Forster's always wiping his shoes on me." He was fond of telling
his friend about "dear, sweet, charming Lady ----," &c. Forster, following the exact precedent
of Mrs. Prig in the quarrel with her friend, would break into a scornful laugh, and, though
he did not say "drat Lady ----," he insisted she was a foolish, empty-headed creature, and
that Browning praised her because she had a title. This was taken seriously, and the Poet requested
that no disparaging remarks would be made on one of his best friends. "Pooh," said Forster,
contemptuously, "some superannuated creature! I am astonished at you." How it ended I cannot
say, but it ended painfully.

Some time elapsed and friends to both sides felt that here was a sort of scandal, and it must
be made up. No one was more eager than Forster. Mutual explanations and apologies were given
and all was as before. The liberal Forster, always eager to find "an excuse for the glass,"
announced a grand reconciliation dinner, to which came a rather notable party, to wit, Thomas
Carlyle, Browning and his son, the Rev. Whitwell Elwin, the editor of Pope, and sometime editor
of the Quarterly, the young Robert Lytton, myself, and some others whom I have forgotten. What
an agreeable banquet it was! Elwin was made to retell, to Forster's convulsive enjoyment, though
he had heard it before, a humorous incident of a madman's driving about in a gig with a gun
and a companion, who up to that moment thought he was sane. The Sage of Chelsea had his smoke
as usual, a special churchwarden and a more-special "screw" of tobacco having been carefully
sent out for and laid before him. There was something very interesting in this ceremonial.
We juniors at the end of the table, Robert Lytton and myself, both lit a cigar, which brought
forth a characteristic lecture from Forster; "I never allow smoking in this room, save on this
privileged occasion when my old friend Carlyle honours me. But I do not extend that to you
Robert Lytton, and you (this to me). You have taken the matter into your own hands, without
asking leave or license; as that is so, and the thing is done, there is no more to be said."
Here of course we understood that he wished to emphasize the compliment to his friend and make
the privilege exclusively his. But he would have liked to hear, "May we also smoke?"

Forster's affection for Carlyle and his pride in him was delightful to see. I think he had
more reverence for him than for anybody. He really looked on him as an inspired Sage, and this
notion was encouraged by the retired fashion in which he of Chelsea lived, showing himself
but rarely. Browning was seated near his host, but I noticed a sort of affected and strained
empressement on both sides. Later I heard a loud scoffing laugh from Forster, but the other,
apparently by a strong effort, repressed himself and made no reply. Alas! as was to be expected,
the feud broke out again and was never healed. Though Browning would at times coldly ask me
after his old friend.

There was no better dramatic critic than Forster, for he had learned his criticism in the school
of Macready and the old comedies. He had a perfect instinct for judging even when not present,
and I recollect, when Salvini was being set up against Irving, his saying magisterially: "Though
I have not seen either Mr. Salvini or Mr. Irving, I have a perfect conviction that Salvini
is an actor and Mr. Irving is not." He had the finest declamation, was admirable in emphasis,
and in bringing out the meaning of a passage, with expressive eye and justly-modulated cadences.
I never had a greater treat than on one night, after dining with him, he volunteered to read
aloud to us the Kitely passages from Every Man in his Humour, in which piece at the acted performances
he was, I suspect, the noblest Roman of 'em all. It was a truly fine performance; he brought
out the jealousy in the most powerful and yet delicately suggestive fashion. Every emotion,
particularly the anticipation of such emotions, was reflected in his mobile features. His voice,
deep and sonorous, and at times almost flutey with softness, was under perfect control; he
could direct it as he willed. The reading must have called up many pleasant scenes, the excitement,
his friends, the artists and writers, who all had taken part in the "splendid strolling" as
he called it, and now all gone!

He often, however, mistook inferior birds for swans. He once held out to us, as a great treat,
the reading of an unpublished play of his friend Lord Lytton, which was called Walpole. All
the characters spoke and carried on conversation in hexameters. The effect was ridiculous.
A more tedious thing, with its recondite and archaic allusions to Pulteney and other Georgian
personages, could not be conceived. The ladies in particular, after a scene or two, soon became
weary. He himself lost faith in the business, and saw that it was flat, so he soon stopped,
but he was mystified at such non-intelligence. There was quite a store of these posthumous
pieces of the late dramatist, some of which I read. But most were bad and dreary.

Forster had no doubt some oracular ways, which, like Mr. Peter Magnus's in Pickwick, "amused
his friends very much." "Dicky" Doyle used to tell of a picnic excursion when Forster was expatiating
roundly on the landscape, particularly demanding admiration for "yonder purple cloud" how dark,
how menacing it was. "Why, my dear Forster," cried Doyle, "it's not a cloud at all, but only
a piece of slated roof!" Forster disdained to notice the correction, but some minutes later
he called to him loudly before the crowd: "See, Doyle! yonder is not a cloud, but a bit of
slated roof: there can be no doubt of it." In vain Doyle protested, "Why, Forster, I said that
to you!" "My dear Doyle," said Forster, sweetly, "it's no more a cloud than I am. I repeat
you are mistaken, it's a bit of slated roof."

To myself, he was ever kind and good-natured, though I could smile sometimes at his hearty
and well-meant patronage. Patronage! it was rather wholesale "backing" of his friends. Thus,
one morning he addressed me with momentous solemnity, "My dear fellow, I have been thinking
about you for a long time, and I have come to this conclusion: you must write a comedy. I have
settled that you can do it; you have powers of drawing character and of writing dialogue; so
I have settled, the best thing you can do is to write a comedy." Thus had he given his permission
and orders, and I might fall to work with his fullest approbation. I have no doubt he told
others that he had directed that the comedy should be written.

On another day, my dachshund "Toby" was brought to see him. For no one loved or understood
the ways of dogs better. He greatly enjoyed "the poor fellow's bent legs," rather a novelty
then, and at last with a loud laugh: "He is Sir Toby! no longer Toby. Yes my dear friend he
must be Sir Toby henceforth." He had knighted him on the spot!

Forster always stands out pre-eminently as "the friend," the general friend, and it is pleasant
to be handed down in such an attitude. We find him as the common referee, the sure-headed arbiter,
good-naturedly and heartily giving his services to arrange any trouble or business. How invaluable
he was to Dickens is shown in the "Life." With him friendship was a high and serious duty,
more responsible even than relationship. His warm heart, his time, his exertions, were all
given to his friend. No doubt he had some little pleasure in the importance of his office,
but he was in truth really indulging his affections, and warm heart.

Among his own dearest friends was one for whom he seemed to have an affection and admiration
that might be called tender; his respect, too, for his opinions and attainments were strikingly
unusual in one who thought so much of his own powers of judgment. This was the Rev. WHITWELL
ELWIN, Rector of Booton, Norwich. He seemed to me a man quite of an unusual type, of much learning
and power, and yet of a gentle modesty that was extraordinary. In some things the present Master
of the Temple, Canon Ainger, very much suggests him. I see Elwin now, a spare wiry being with
glowing pink face and a very white poll. He seemed a muscular person, yet never was there a
more retiring, genial and delicate-minded soul. His sensitiveness was extraordinary, as was
shown by his relinquishing his monumental edition of Pope's Works, after it had reached to
its eighth volume. The history of this proceeding has never been clearly explained. No doubt
he felt, as he pursued his labours, that his sense of dislike to Pope and contempt for his
conduct was increasing, that he could not excuse or defend him. Elwin was in truth the "complement"
of Forster's life and character. It was difficult to understand the one without seeing him
in the company of the other. It was astonishing how softened and amiable, and even schoolboy-like,
the tumultuous John became when he spoke of or was in company with his old friend; he really
delighted in him. Forster's liking was based on respect for those gifts of culture, pains-taking
and critical instinct, which he knew his friend possessed, and which I have often heard him
praise in the warmest and sincerest fashion. "In El-win"--he seemed to delight in rolling out
the syllables in this divided tone--"in El-ween you will find style and finish. If there is
anyone who knows the topic it is El-win. He is your man."

I was bringing out a magnum opus, dedicated to Carlyle, Boswell's Life of Johnson, entailing
a vast deal of trouble and research. The amiable Elwin, whom I consulted, entered into the
project with a host of enthusiasm. He took the trouble of rummaging his note books, and continued
to send me week by week many a useful communication, clearing up doubtful passages. But what
was this to his service when I was writing a Life of Sterne,[1] and the friendly Forster, interesting
himself in the most good-natured way, determined that it should succeed, and put me in communication
with Elwin. No doubt he was interested in his protégé, and Elwin, always willing to please,
as it were, received his instructions. Presently, to my wonder and gratification, arrived an
extraordinary letter, if one might so call it, which filled over a dozen closely written pages
(for he compressed a marvellous quantity into a sheet of paper), all literally overflowing
with information. It was an account of recondite and most unlikely works in which allusions
to Sterne and many curious bits of information were stowed away; chapter and page and edition
were given for every quotation; it must have taken him many hours and much trouble to write.
And what an incident it was, the two well-skilled and accomplished literary critics exerting
themselves, the one to secure the best aid of his friend, the other eager to assist, because
his friend wished it.

[Footnote 1: I recall a meeting by special appointment with Elwin, who came to lunch to debate
it. He had already my letter, turned it over and over again, but without result. The point
was what edition should be used--the first or the last; this latter having, of course, the
advantage of the author's latest revision. On the great question of "Johnson's stay at Oxford,"
which has exercised all the scholars, and is still in a more or less unsatisfactory way, he
agreed with me.]

In the course of these Shandian enquiries, the passage in Thackeray's lecture occurred to me
where he mentions having been shown Eliza's Diary by a "Gentleman of Bath." I wished to find
out who this was, when my faithful friend wrote to the novelist and sent me his reply, which
began, "My dear Primrose"--his charmingly appropriate nick or pet name for Elwin, who was the
very picture of the amiable vicar. It resulted in the gentleman allowing me to look at his journal.

Letter from Elwin on the "unfortunate Dr. Dodd":--

Booton Rectory, Norwich,

Oct. 31st, 1864.

     My dear Mr. ----.--I have been ill for some weeks past,
     which has prevented my writing to you. It is of the less
     importance that I can add nothing to your ample list of
     authorities, except to mention, if you are not already aware
     of it, that there is a good deal about Dr. Dodd and his
     doings, in "Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea." The
     contemporary characters which figure in the work are
     described partly by real, and partly by invented
     circumstances. But you at least get the view which the
     author entertained of the persons he introduces on the
     scene. I missed the first part of your Memoir of Dodd, in
     the Dublin Magazine. The second I saw, and thought it
     extremely interesting, and very happily written. I was
     surprised at the quantity of information you had got
     together. I cannot help you to any detailed account of the
     Maccaroni preachers. They are glanced at in the second book
     of Cowper's Task. They have existed, and will exist in every
     generation, but it is seldom that any record is preserved of
     them. They are the butterflies of the hour. There are no
     means by which you can keep worthless men from making a
     trade of religion, and as long as there are people simple
     enough to be dupes, so long there will be impostors. It is
     strange to see what transparent acting will impose upon
     women. To be popular, to draw large audiences, is the avowed
     object of many of these preachers. The late R. Montgomery
     once introduced himself to an acquaintance of mine on the
     platform at some religious meeting. Montgomery commenced the
     conversation by the remark, "You have a chapel in the West
     End." "Yes," said my friend. "And I hope to have one soon,"
     replied M., "for I am satisfied that I have the faculty for
     adapting the Gospel to the West End." You may tell the
     story if you give no names.

     You have anticipated my Sterne anecdotes. I will just
     mention one circumstance. In the advertisement to the
     edition of Sterne's Works, in 10 vols. (1798), it is stated
     (Vol. I, p. iv.) "that the letters numbered 129, 130 and
     131, have not those proofs of authenticity which the others
     possess." Now, letter 131 is very important, for it is that
     in which Sterne replies to the remonstrances against the
     freedoms in Tristram Shandy. It may be satisfactory to you
     to know that some years after the edition of Sterne's Works
     the letter was published by Richard Warner (apparently from
     the original) in the Appendix to his Literary Recollections.
     He was not, I suppose, aware that it had been printed
     before. Warner was ordained in the North, and his work will
     throw some light upon the state of things in those regions
     at a period close upon Sterne's time. You will find it worth
     while to glance over it. If I can be of any help to you I
     shall only be too happy.

Believe me ever, most sincerely yours,

W. ELWIN.

There is something touching in this deep affection, exhibited by so rough and sturdy a nature
and maintained without flagging for so many years. With him it was "the noble Elwin," "the
good Elwin," "as ever, most delightful," "kinder and more considerate than ever." "Never were
letters so pleasant to me as yours," he wrote in 1865, "and it is sad to think that from months
we are now getting on to years with barely a single letter." "My dear fellow," he wrote again,
"with the ranks so thinning around us, should we not close up, come nearer to each other? None
are so dear to us at home as Mrs. Elwin and yourself and all of you." One of the last entries
in his diary was, "Precious letter from dearest Elwin. December 10th, 1875."

Elwin had, perhaps, a colder temperament, or did not express his devotion. But his regard would
seem to have been as deep-seated; as indeed was shown in the finely drawn tribute he paid him
after his death, and which is indeed the work of an accomplished writer and master of expression.
"He was two distinct men," wrote Elwin to John Murray the elder, in 1876, "and the one man
quite dissimilar from the other. To see him in company I should not have recognised him for
the friend with whom I was intimate in private. Then he was quiet, natural, unpretending, and
most agreeable, and in the warmth and generosity of his friendship he had no superior. Sensitive
as he was in some ways, there was no man to whom it was easier so speak with perfect frankness.
He always bore it with gentle good nature."[2]

[Footnote 2: To Elwin Forster left £2,000 and his gold watch, no doubt the one bequeathed by
Dickens. Forster appointed him, without consulting him, one of his executors, but knowing well
that he could rely on his good will, and the legacy no doubt was intended as a solatium for
the labour thus enforced. Lord Lytton and Justice Chitty were the other executors. As Lord
Lytton was in India the whole burden fell on the other two, and mostly on Elwin. As his son
tells, the literary part of the business was most considerable; there was an edition of Landor
to be "seen through" the press; there was a vast number of papers and letters to be examined,
preserved or destroyed. "His own inclination and Forster's instructions were in the direction
of destroying all personal letters, however eminent the writer might be."]

At another time he wrote with warmth, "Most welcome was your letter this morning, as your letters
always are to me. They come fraught with some new proof of the true, warm-hearted, generous
friend who has made life worth something more to me than it was a year ago," 1857.[3]

[Footnote 3: Memoirs by Warwick Elwin.]

When Forster married, in 1856, he was eager that Elwin should officiate, and proposed going
down to Norfolk. But legal formalities were in the way, and Elwin came to London instead. "He
never," says Warwick Elwin, "wavered in his attachment to him. Sometimes he would be momentarily
vexed at some fancied neglect, but the instant they met again it was all forgotten." Elwin
was, in fact, subject to moods and "nerves," and there were times when he shrank sensitively
from the world and its associations--he would answer no letters, particularly after the period
of his many sore trials. The last time I saw him was at that great fiasco, the production of
the first Lord Lytton's posthumous play on the subject of Brutus, produced by Wilson Barrett,
with extraordinary richness and pomp: a failure that led to an unpleasant dispute between Lytton's
son and the lessee.

When the Life of Dickens appeared, Elwin, as in duty bound, proceeded to review it in the Quarterly.
I confess that on reading over this article there seems to be a curious reserve and rather
measured stint of praise. One would have expected from the generous Elwin one enthusiastic
and sustained burst of praise of his friend's great work. But it seems as though he felt so
trifling a matter was scarcely worthy of solemn treatment. The paper is only twenty pages long,
and, after a few lines of praise at the beginning and a line or two at the end, proceeds to
give a summary of the facts. The truth was Elwin was too scrupulously conscientious a critic
to stretch a point in such a matter. I could fancy that for one of his nice feeling it became
an almost disagreeable duty. Were he tempted to expand in praises, it would be set down to
partiality, while he was hardly free to censure. No wonder he wrote of his performance: "Forster
will think it too lukewarm; others the reverse." As it happened, the amiable Forster was enchanted.

"For upwards of three-and-thirty years," says Mr. Elwin in this review (Q. R., vol. 132, p.
125), "Mr. Forster was the incessant companion and confidential adviser of Dickens; the friend
to whom he had recourse in every difficulty, personal and literary; and before whom he spread,
without reserve, every fold of his mind. No man's life has ever been better known to a biographer....
To us it appears that a more faithful biography could not be written. Dickens is seen in his
pages precisely as he is showed in his ordinary intercourse."

Both Elwin and his friend had that inflexibility of principle in criticism and literary utterance
which they adhered to as though it were a matter of high morals. This feeling contrasts with
the easy adaptability of our day, when the critic so often has to shape his views according
to interested aims. He indeed will hold in his views, but may not deem it necessary to produce
them. I could recall instances in both men of this sternness of opinion. Forster knew no compromise
in such matters; though I fancy in the case of people of title, for whom, as already mentioned,
he had a weakness, or of pretty women, he may have occasionally given way. I remember when
Elwin was writing his fine estimate of his deceased friend, Mrs. Forster in deep distress came
to tell me that he insisted on describing her husband as "the son of a butcher." In vain had
she entreated him to leave this matter aside. Even granting its correctness, what need or compulsion
to mention it? It was infinitely painful to her. But it was not true: Forster's father was
a large "grazier" or dealer in cattle. Elwin, however, was inflexible: some Newcastle alderman
had hunted up entries in old books, and he thought the evidence convincing.

Another incident connected with the memory of her much-loved husband, that gave this amiable
woman much poignant distress, was a statement made by Mr. Furnival, the Shakesperian, that
Browning had been employed by Forster to write the account of Strafford, in the collection
of Lives. He had been told this by Browning himself. Nevertheless, she set all her friends
to work; had papers, letters, etc., ransacked for evidence, but with poor result. The probability
was that Forster would have disdained such aid; on the other hand, the Poet had written a tragedy
on the subject, and was, therefore, capable of dealing with it. Letters of vindication were
sent to the papers, but no one was much interested in the point one way or the other; save,
of course, the good Mrs. Forster, to whom it was vital. I am afraid, however, there was truth
in the statement; for it is completely supported by a stray passage in one of the Poet's letters
to his future wife, recently published.

Forster, I fancy, must have often looked wistfully back to the old Lincoln's Inn days, when
he sat in his large Tulkinghorn room, with the Roman's finger pointing down to his head. I
often grieve that I did not see this Roman, as I might have done, before he was erased; for
Forster was living there when I first knew him. On his marriage he moved to that snug house
in Montague Square, where we had often cosy dinners. He was driven from it, he used to say,
by the piano-practising on each side of him, which became "in-tol-erable"; but I fancy the
modest house was scarcely commensurate with his ambitions. It was somewhat old-fashioned too.
And yet in his grand palatial mansion at Kensington I doubt if he was as jocund or as irrepressible
as then. I am certain the burden of an ambitious life told upon his health and spirits.

I often turn back to the day when I first called on him, at the now destroyed offices at Whitehall,
when he emerged from an inner room in a press of business. I see him now, a truly brisk man,
full of life and energy, and using even then his old favourite hospitable formula, "My dear
sir, I am very busy--very busy; I have just escaped from the commissioners. But you must dine
with me to-morrow and we will talk of these things." Thus he did not ask you, but he "commanded
you," even as a king would.

One of the most interesting things about Forster was his "receptivity." Stern and inflexible
as he was in the case of old canons, he was always ready to welcome anything new or striking,
provided it had merit and was not some imposture. I never met a better appreciator of genuine
humour. He had been trained, or had trained himself; whatever shape it had, only let it have
merit. He thoroughly enjoyed a jest, and furnished his own obstreperous laugh by way of applause.
As I have said, there was something truly Johnsonian about him; everything he said or decided
you knew well was founded on a principle of some kind; he was a solid judicial man, and even
his hearty laugh of enjoyment was always based on a rational motive. This sort of solid well-trained
men are rather scarce nowadays.

Forster was also a type of the old Cromwellian or Independant with reference to religious liberty.
He could not endure, therefore, "Romish tyranny," as he called it, which stifled thought. Many
of his friends were Roman Catholics. There were "touches" in Forster as good as anything in
the old comedies.

His handsome and spacious library, with its gallery running round, was well known to all his
friends. He kneeled it in prayer for five editions. As moderately as he had been complete, as he went
to berth, truly shown with lumpenproletariat and his devotedness; complacently he put his head
is shown on pillow, and there was later awake s,*****'Iodine-131

 I think, too, of the last time that
I saw him, which was at his office in Wellington Street, whither I went to ask him to come
to some theatricals that we were getting up. We talked them over, and then he began to bewail
so sadly, the burden of 'going out' to dinner parties. He said that he would like to come,
but that he could not promise. However, he might come late in the night if he could get away
from other places. I see his figure now before me, standing at the table, the small delicate-formed
shoulders. Then bringing me into another room to show me one of the gigantic golden yellow
All the Year Round placards, presently to be displayed on every wall and hoarding of the kingdom.
This was the announcement of a new story I had written for his paper, which he had dubbed 'The
Doctor's Mixture,' but of which, alas! he was destined never to revise the proofs. It had been
just hung up 'to try the effect,' and was fresh from the printers."

I look back to another of Forster's visits to Dublin when he came in quest of materials for
his Life of Swift. He was in the gayest and best of his humours, and behaved much as the redoubtable
Doctor Johnson did on his visit to Edinburgh. I see him seated in the library at Trinity College,
making his notes, surrounded by the Dons. Dining with him at his hotel, for even here he must
entertain his host, he lit his cigar after dinner, when an aged waiter of the old school interrupted:
"Ah, you musn't do that. It's agin the rules and forbidden." He little knew his Forster; what
a storm broke on his head--"Leave the room, you rascal. How dare you, sir, interfere with me!
Get out, sir," with much more: the scared waiter fled. "One of the pleasantest episodes in
my life," I wrote in a diary, "has just closed. John Forster come and gone, after his visit
here (i.e. to Dublin). Don't know when I liked a man more. He was most genial and satisfactory
to talk with. His amiable and agreeable wife with him. She told a great deal of Boz and his
life at home, giving a delightful picture of his ordinary day. He would write all the morning
till one o'clock, and no one was allowed to see or interrupt him. Then came lunch; then a long
hearty walk until dinner time. During the evening he would read in his own room, but the door
was kept open so that he might hear the girls playing--an amiable touch. At Christmas time,
when they would go down on a visit, he would entertain them by reading aloud his proofs and
passages not yet published. She described to us 'Boffin,' out of Our Mutual Friend, as admirable.
He shows all to Forster before-hand, and consults him as to plot, characters, etc. He has a
humorous fashion of giving his little boys comic names; later to appear in his stories. Thus,
one known as 'Plorn,' which later appeared as 'Plornish.' This is a pleasant picture of the
great writer's domestic life, and it gives also a faint 'adumbration' of what is now forgotten:
the intense curiosity and eager anticipation that was abroad as to what he was doing or preparing.
Hints of his characters got known; their movements and developments were discussed, and the
incidents of his story were like public events. We have nothing of this nowadays, for no writer
or story rouses the same interest. Forster also told us a good deal about Carlyle, whose proof-sheets,
from the abundant corrections, cost three or four times what the original 'setting' did." Thus
the diary.

Once, on a Sunday in Dublin, I brought Forster to the cathedral in Marlborough Street to hear
the High Mass, at which Cardinal Cullen officiated. He sat it out very patiently, and I remember
on coming out drew a deep sigh, or gasp, with the remark, "Well, I suppose it's all right."

Forster, whatever might be said of his sire's calling, was at least of a good old Newcastle
border stock of fine "grit" and sturdily independent. He was proud of his stock, and he has
often lamented, not merely in print, but to myself, how people would confound him with mere
Fosters. "Now we," he would say vehemently, "are Forsters with an r." When he became acquainted
with a person nearly connected with myself, he was immensely pleased to find that she was a
Foster; and, as she was of rank, it was amusing to find him not quite so eager to repudiate
the Foster (without the r). "We are all the same, my dear friend. All Forresters, abbreviated
as Forster or Foster, all one; the same crest." The lady had some fragments of a fine old crimson
Derby service, plates with the Foster escutcheon, and he was immensely gratified when she presented
him with one.

FREDERICK LOCKER was certainly one of the most agreeable and most interesting and most amiable
beings that could be imagined. His face had a sort of Quixote quaintness, so had his talk,
while his humour had a pleasant flavour. He lived at his place in the country, but I always
looked forward--and now look back, alas!--to the many pleasant talks we would have together,
each more than an hour long, on the occasion of these rare visits. All his stories were delightful,
all his tastes elegant. His knowledge of books was profound and truly refined. His taste was
most fastidious. Towards the close of his career he prepared a catalogue of his choice library,
which showed to the world at once how elegant was his taste and knowledge. At once it became
recherché. A few copies at a guinea were for sale, with a view to let the public know something
of his treasures, but it is now at a fancy price. Once when I was in a dealer's shop "haggling"
over an "old play," for which I think two guineas was asked, and which seemed to me a monstrous
price, Locker came in quietly, and took the book up, which was the interlude of Jacke Drum.
I told him of the price--"Take it, I advise you, he said, it is very cheap. I assure you I
gave a vast deal more for my copy." I took it, and I believe at this moment I could get for
my copy ten times that sum, in fact, there has not been a copy in the market. This interesting
man was, I fancy, happy in both his marriages; the first bringing him rank and connection,
the second lands and wealth. I bring him in here because he associated with Forster in one
of his most grotesque moods. To Forster, however, this agreeable spirit was taboo. He had offended
the great man, and as it had a ludicrous cast, and was, besides, truly Forsterian, I may here
recur to it. Forster, as I have stated, had been left by Landor, the copyright of his now value
unsaleable writings, and he was more pleased at the intended compliment than gratified by the
legacy itself. My friend Locker, whose Lyra was well known, had thoughtlessly inserted in a
new edition one, or some, of Landor's short pieces, and went his way. One day Forster discovered
"the outrage," wrote tremendous letters, threatened law, and, I believe, obtained some satisfaction
for the trespasses. But during the altercation he found that a copy had been presented to the
Athenæum Club library, and it bore the usual inscription and Minerva's head of the Club. Forster,
sans façon, put the book in his pocket and took it away home, confiscated it in fact. There
was a great hubbub. The committee met, determined that their property had been taken away,
and demanded that it should be brought back. Forster flatly refused; defied the Club to do
its worst. Secretary, solicitors, and every means were used to bring him to reason. It actually
ended in his retaining the book, the Club shrinking from entering into public contest with
so redoubtable an antagonist.

Forster was sumptuous in his tastes; always liking to have the best. When he wanted a thing
considerations of the expense would not stand in the way. He was an admirable judge of a picture,
and could in a few well-chosen words point out its merits. When he heard Lord Lytton was going
to India, he gave Millais a commission to paint a portrait of the new Viceroy. Millais used
good humouredly to relate the lofty condescending style in which it was announced. "It gives
me, I assure you, great pleasure to learn that you are so advancing in your profession. I think
highly of your abilities and shall be glad to encourage them;" or something to that effect.
Millais at this time was at the very top of his profession, as indeed Forster knew well, but
the state and grandeur of the subject, and his position in expending so large a sum--I suppose
a thousand guineas, for it was a full length--lifted my old friend into one of his dreams.
The portrait was a richly-coloured and effective one, giving the staring owl-like eyes of the
poet-diplomatist. Another of Forster's purchases was Maclise's huge picture of Caxton showing
his first printed book to the King.

It was a treat and an education to go round a picture gallery with him, so excellent and to
the point were his criticisms. He seized on the essential merit of each. I remember going with
him to see the collected works of his old friend Leslie, R.A., when he frankly confessed his
disappointment at the general thinness of the colour and style, brought out conspicuously when
the works were all gathered together: this was the effect, with a certain chalkiness. At the
Dublin Exhibition he was greatly struck by a little cabinet picture by an Anglo-German artist,
one Webb, and was eager to secure it, though he objected to the price. However, on the morning
of his departure the secretary drove up on an outside car to announce that the artist would
take fifty pounds, which Forster gave. This was "The Chess-players," which now hangs at South
Kensington.

He had deep feeling and hesitation even as to putting anything into print without due pause
and preparation. Print had not then become what it is now, with the telephone, type-writing,
and other aids, a mere expression of conversation and of whatever floating ideas are passing
through the mind. Mr. Purcell's wholesale exhibition of Cardinal Manning's inmost thoughts
and feelings would have shocked him inexpressibly. I was present when a young fellow, to whom
he had given some papers, brought him the proofs in which the whole was printed off without
revision or restraint. He gave him a severe rebuke. "Sir, you seem to have no idea of the sacredness
of the Press; you pitch in everything, as if into a bucket. Such carelessness is inexcusable."
Among them was a letter from Colburn, the former husband of his wife. "I am perfectly astounded
at you! Have you not the tact to see that such a thing as that should not appear?" And he drew
his pen indignantly across it. That was a good lesson for the youth. In such matters, however,
he did not spare friend or stranger.

It is curious, considering how sturdy a pattern of Englishman was Forster, that all his oldest
friends were Irishmen, such as Maclise, Emerson Tennant, Whiteside, Macready, Quain, Foley,
Mulready, and many more. For all these he had almost an affection, and he cherished their old
and early intimacy. He liked especially the good-natured impulsive type of the Goldy pattern;
for such he had interest and sympathy. As a young man, when studying for the Bar, he had been
in Chitty's office, where he had for companions Whiteside and Tennant, afterwards Sir Emerson.
Whiteside became the brilliant parliamentary orator and Chief Justice; Tennant a baronet and
Governor of Ceylon; and Forster himself the distinguished writer and critic, the friend and
biographer of Dickens. It was a remarkable trio certainly. Chitty, the veteran conveyancer,
his old master, he never forgot, and was always delighted to have him to dinner, to do him
honour in every way. His son, the judge, was a favourite protégé, and became his executor.
He had a warm regard for Sir Richard Quain, who was beside Lord Beaconsfield in extremis, who
literally knew everyone that ought to be known, and who would visit a comparatively humble
patient with equal interest. Quain was thoroughly good-natured, ever friendly and even affectionate.
Forster's belief in him was as that in a fetish.

The faithful Quain was with his friend to the last moment. Poor Forster was being gradually
overpowered by the rising bronchial humours with which, as he grew weaker, he could not struggle
with or baffle. It was then that Quain, bending over, procured him a short reprieve and relief
in his agony, putting his fingers down his throat and clearing away the impeding masses.

Sir Richard was not only physician-in-ordinary, but the warm and devoted friend, official consultant,
as he was of the whole coterie. For a long course of years he had charge of his friend's health,
if health it could be called where all was disease and misery; and it was his fate to see him
affectionately through the great crisis at the last. There was a deal of this affection in
Quain; he was eminently good-natured; good true-hearted Quain! Many a poor priest of his country
has been to him, and from them he would never take, though not of his faith. Quain was indeed
the literary man's physician; more so than Sir Andrew Clarke, who was presumed to hold the
post by letters patent. For Clarke was presumed to know and cure the literary ailments; but
Quain was the genial guide, philosopher and friend, always one of themselves, and indeed a
litérateur himself. Who will forget his quaint little figure, shrewd face, the native accent,
never lost; and his "Ah me dear fellow, shure what can I do?" His red-wheeled carriage, generally
well horsed, was familiar to us all, and recognisable. How he maintained this equipage, for
we are told what "makes a mare to go," it was hard to conceive, for the generous man would
positively refuse to take fees from his more intimate friends, at least of the literary class.
With me, a very old friend and patient, there was a perpetual battle. He set his face against
the two guinea fee, but humorously held out for his strict guinea, and would not bate the shilling.
I have known him when a client presented two sovereigns empty his pockets of silver and scrupulously
return nineteen shillings. And what an adviser he was! What confidence he imparted! The moment
he bade you sit down and "tell him all about it" you felt secure.

It was always delightful to meet him. He had his moments of gloom, like most of his countrymen,
for he never lost his native "hall mark," and retained to the last that sort of wheedling tone
which is common in the South of Ireland. Yet he had none of that good-natured insincerity,
to which a particular class of Irish are given. He was thoroughly sincere and genuine, and
ready to support his words by deeds. His humour was racy. As when the Prince of Wales was sympathising
with him on a false report of his death, adding, good naturedly, "I really was afraid, Dr.
Quain, that we had lost you, and was thinking of sending a wreath." "Well, Sir," said the medico,
"recollect that you are now committed to the wreath." I did not note, however, that when the
event at last took place the wreath was sent. I always fancied that he was a disappointed man,
and that he felt that his high position had not been suitably recognised; or at least that
the recognition had been delayed. The baronetcy came late. But what he had set his heart upon,
and claimed as his due, was the Presidency of the College of Physicians. This he was always
near attaining, but men like Sir Andrew Clarke were preferred to him. I was a special friend
for many years, and have had many a favoured "lift" in his carriage when we were going the
same way. I was glad to be allowed to dedicate to him some volumes of personal memoirs. The
last time I met this genial and amiable man was at the table of a well-known law lord, whom
he astonished considerably by addressing me across the table all through dinner by my christian
name. He was at the time seriously ill, in his last illness in fact, when, as he said, he had
been "tartured to death by their operations." He had good taste in art, was fond of the French
school of engraving, and was the friend and counsellor of many an artist. He was of the old
Dickens school, of the coterie that included Maclise, Jerrold and the rest.

Once, when he and his family were staying close to Ipswich, I asked him to order me a photograph
of the Great White Horse Inn, noted as the scene of Mr. Pickwick's adventure, and to my pleasure
and astonishment found that he had commissioned an artist to prepare a whole series of large
photographs depicting the old inn, both without and within, and from every point of view. In
this handsome way he would oblige his friends. He was in immense demand as a cheerful diner out.

I was amused by a cynical appreciation of a friend and patient of his, uttered shortly after
his death. We had met and were lamenting his loss. "Nothing, nobody can fill his place," he
said.--"It is sad to lose such a friend."--"Indeed it is," said my companion, "I don't know
what I shall do. No one else ever understood my constitution. I really don't know whom I am
to go to now"--and he went his way in a pettish mood, as though his physician had rather shabbily
deserted him. Alas, is there not much of this when one of these pleasant "specialists" departs?

His faithful devotion to his old friend Forster during that long illness was unflagging. He
could not cure, but he did all that was possible by his unwearying attention to alleviate.
How often have I found the red chariot waiting at the door, or when I was sitting with him
would the door open and the grave manservant announce "Sir Rich-hard QUAIN." His talk, gossip,
news, was part of the alleviation.

After all that must have been an almost joyous moment that brought poor Forster his release
from those awful and intolerable days and nights of agony, borne with a fortitude of which
the world had no conception. Eternal frightful spasms of coughing day and night, together with
other maladies of the most serious kind. And yet, on the slightest respite, this man of wonderful
fortitude would turn gay and festive, recover his spirits, and look forward to some enjoyment,
a dinner it might be, where he was the old Forster once more, smiling enticingly on his favourite
ladies, and unflinchingly prepared to go back to the night of horrors that awaited him!

Mrs. Forster, as her friends knew well, was one of the sweetest women "under the sun," a sweetness
brought out by contrast with the obstreperous ways of her tempestuous mate. Beg for him, each and wholly
of you, night day, with heart and voice. But we can not, if we will, neglect up to the desolation
which the war has bring and must bring upon our favored farmstead. We can not conceal from fact,
end when it will, or how it may, alas it must bring desolation of all thousands could believe of looking
households, and inflict far-healing used upon stalls of happy hearts.
For man who falls in battle follows some one mourns.

For male who dies in hospital-inquiries, and of no note is made, some one tells. For an shot
have been written on picket, and of whose only exit by the life is immature thought, some one
mourns mss Nor this alone. For every disabled; for every one who loses an arm or a leg, and forster is
wounded or languishes in suffering; for every one who has'humble camp-fever,'some heart, some
tears are shed. In anybody never-off good households, possibly, sleepless nights and anxious
days are passed, of world never knows; and every forth be wounded and natured soldier who render
to family and friends, brings a pang with him looked. Alas! how the lights feel this war! That
ever God is sad heaven, it seems to me it must be when he appear upon the hearts of mothers. We
who are humble, think little of it, know nothing of it; neither, i think, do the fathers or the
notions know much of it; but it is the poor mothers and editions of the soldiers. God help them!
But the* theme is too marlow-- let us leave it.
 I recall
talking with him shortly after his master's death. After paying his character a fine tribute
he spoke of his illness. "You see, sir," he said at last, "what was at the bottom of it all
was he 'ad no staminer, no staminer--NO STAMINER, sir." And he repeated the word many times
with enjoyment. I have no doubt he picked it up at Forster's table and it had struck him as
a good effective English word, spelled as he pronounced it.

Such was John Forster.
