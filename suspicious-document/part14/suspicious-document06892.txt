SIR THOMAS BROWNE

TO MY WIFE

You who know something of the irony of life in general, and still more of it in the present
particular, will not be surprised that, having made two strict rules for my guidance in the
writing of this book, I break them both in the first page! Indeed, I can hear you say, though
without any touch of the satirical, that it was only natural that I should do so.

The first of my two rules, heartily approved by you, let me add, is that I should not mention
you in my autobiography.--We both deem it foolish as well as unseemly to violate in print the
freemasonry of marriage.-- The second, not unlike the first, is not to write about living people.
And here am I hard at it in both cases!

Yet, after all, I have kept to my resolve in the spirit, if not in the letter:--and this though
it has cost me some very good "copy,"--copy, too, which would have afforded me the pleasantest
of memories. There are things seen by us together which I much regret to leave unchronicled,
but these must wait for another occasion. Many of them are quite suitable to be recorded in
one's lifetime. For example, I should dearly like to set forth our ride from Jerusalem to Damascus,
together with some circumstances, as an old-fashioned traveller might have said, concerning
the Garden of the Jews at Jahoni, and the strange and beautiful creature we found therein.

I count myself happy indeed to have seen half the delightful and notable things I have seen
during my life, in your company. Do you remember the turbulent magnificence of our winter passage
of the Splügen, not in a snowstorm, but in something much more thrilling--a fierce windstorm
in a great frost? The whirling, stinging, white dust darkened the air and coated our sledges,
our horses, and our faces. We shall neither of us ever forget how just below the Hospice your
sledge was actually blown over by the mere fury of the blizzard; how we tramped through the
drifts, and how all ended in "the welcome of an inn" on the summit; the hot soup and the Côtelettes
de Veau. It was together, too, that we watched the sunrise from the Citadel at Cairo and saw
the Pyramids tipped with rose and saffron. Ours, too, was the desert mirage that, in spite
of reason and experience, almost betrayed us in our ride to the Fayum. You shared with me what
was certainly an adventure of the spirit, though not of the body, when for the first time we
saw the fateful and well-loved shores of America. The lights danced like fireflies in the great
towers of New York, while behind them glowed in sombre splendour the fiery Bastions of a November
sunset.

But, of course, none of all this affords the reason why I dedicate my book to you. That reason
will perhaps be fully understood only by me and by our children. It can also be found in certain
wise and cunning little hearts, inscrutable as those of kings, in a London nursery. Susan,
Charlotte, and Christopher could tell if they would.

If that sounds inconsequent, or, at any rate, incomprehensible, may I not plead that so do
the ineffable Mysteries of Life and Death.

J. ST. LOE STRACHEY.

PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION

It is with great pleasure that I accept Major Putnam's suggestion that I should write a special
preface to the American edition of my autobiography. Major Putnam, I, and the Spectator, are
a triumvirate of old friends, and I should not be likely to refuse a request made by him, even
if its fulfilment was a much less agreeable task than that of addressing an American audience.

I was born with a mind which might well be described as Anima naturaliter Americana. I have
always loved America and the Americans, and, though I cannot expect them to feel for me as
I feel for them, I cherish the belief that, at any rate, they do not dislike me instinctively.
That many of them regard me as somewhat wild and injudicious in my praise of their country
I am well aware. They hold that I often praise America not only too much, but that I praise
her for the wrong things,--praise, indeed, where I ought to censure, and so "spoil" their countrymen.
Well, if that is a true bill, all I can say is that it is too late to expect me to mend my ways.

During my boyhood people here understood America much less than they do now. Though I should
be exaggerating if I said that there was anything approaching dislike of America or Americans,
there were certain intellectual people in England who were apt to parade a kind of conscious
and supercilious patronage of the wilder products of American life and literature. I heard
exaggerated stories about Americans, and especially about the Americans of the Far West,--heard
them, that is, represented as semi-barbarians, coarse, rash, and boastful, with bad manners
and no feeling for the reticences of life. Such legends exasperated me beyond words. I felt
as did the author of Ionica on re-reading the play of Ajax.

  The world may like, for all I care,
     The gentler voice, the cooler head,
   That bows a rival to despair,
     And cheaply compliments the dead.

  That smiles at all that's coarse and rash,
     Yet wins the trophies of the fight,
   Unscathed in honour's wreck and crash,
     Heartless, but always in the right.

       *       *       *       *       *

There were my superior persons drawn to the life!

When the complaisant judge would not acknowledge the rights of the noble Ajax, but gave to
another what was due to him, the poet touched me even more nearly:--

  Thanked, and self-pleased: ay, let him wear
     What to that noble breast was due;
   And I, dear passionate Teucer, dare
     Go through the homeless world with you.

FORTUNE would have been good been become i supposed to enthusiasts

A first viii bow was very over rule, and will think the last in view.


Looking back at the lucky accident which brought the right book, the right reviewer, and the
properly-tuned editors together, I am bound to say that I think that the editors were right
and that I had produced good copy. At any rate, their view being what it was, I have no sort
of doubt that they were quite right to express it as plainly and as generously as they did
to me. To have followed the conventional rule of not puffing up a young man with praise and
to have guarded their true opinion as a kind of guilty secret would have been distinctly unfair
to me, nay, prejudicial. There are, I suppose, a certain number of young people to whom it
would be unsafe to give a full measure of eulogy. But these are a small minority. The ordinary
young man or young woman is much more likely to be encouraged or sometimes even alarmed by
unstinted praise. Generous encouragement is the necessary mental nourishment of youth, and
those who withhold it from them are not only foolish but cruel. They are keeping food from
the hungry.

If my editors had told me that they thought the review rather a poor piece of work, I should,
by "the law of reversed effort," have been almost certain to have taken up a combative line
and have convinced myself that it was epoch-making. When a man thinks himself overpraised,
if he has anything in him at all, he begins to get anxious about his next step. He is put very
much on his mettle not to lose what he has gained.

It may amuse my readers, if I quote a few sentences from the article, and allow them to see
whether their judgment coincides with that of my chiefs at The Spectator on a matter which
was for me fraught with the decrees of Destiny. This is how I began my review of Swift and
his masterpiece:

"Never anyone living thought like you," said to Swift the woman who loved him with a passion
that had caught some of his own fierceness and despair. The love which great natures inspire
had endowed Vanessa with a rare inspiration. Half-consciously she has touched the notes that
help us to resolve the discord in Swift's life. Truly, the mind of living man never worked
as Swift's worked. That this is so is visible in every line, in every word he ever wrote. No
phrase of his is like any other man's; no conception of his is ever cast in the common mould.
It is this that lends something so dreadful and mysterious to all Swift's writings.

From this time I began to get books regularly from The Spectator and to pay periodical visits
to the office, where I learned to understand and to appreciate my chiefs. But more of them
later. The year 1886 was one of political convulsion, the year of the great split in the Liberal
Party; the year in which Lord Hartington and Mr. Chamberlain finally severed themselves from
Mr. Gladstone and began that co- operation with the Conservatives which resulted in the formation
of the Unionist Party. I do not, however, want to deal here with the Unionist crisis, except
so far as it affected me and The Spectator. While my father and my elder brother remained Liberals
and followed Mr. Gladstone, I followed Lord Hartington, Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Goschen. My
conversion was not in any way sought by my new friends and chiefs at The Spectator office,
though they at once took the Unionist side. I have no doubt, however, that my intercourse with
Hutton and Townsend had its effect, though I also think that my mind was naturally Unionist
in politics. I was already a Lincoln worshipper in American history and desired closer union
with the Dominions, not separation. I was for concentration, not dispersion, in the Empire.
In any case, I took the plunge, one which might have been painful if my father had not been
the most just, the most fair-minded, and the most kind-hearted of men. Although he was an intense,
nay, a fierce Gladstonian, I never had the slightest feeling of estrangement from him or he
from me. It happened, however, that the break-up of the Liberal Party affected me greatly at
The Spectator. When the election of 1886 took place, I was asked by a friend and Somersetshire
neighbour, Mr. Henry Hobhouse, who had become, like me, a Liberal Unionist, to act as his election
agent. This I did, though, as a matter of fact, he was unopposed. The moment he was declared
elected I made out my return as election agent and went straight back to my work in London.
Almost at once I received a letter which surprised me enormously. It was from Mr. Hutton, telling
me that Mr. Townsend had gone away for his usual summer holiday, and that he wanted someone
to come and help him by writing a couple of leaders a week and some of the notes. I, of course,
was delighted at the prospect, for my mind was full of politics and I was longing to have my
say. Here again, though it did not consciously occur to me that I was in for anything big,
I seem to have had some sort of subconscious premonition. At any rate, I accepted with delight
and well remember my talk at the office before taking up my duties. My editor explained to
me that Mr. Asquith, who had been up till the end of 1885 the writer of a weekly leader in
The Spectator and also a holiday writer, had now severed his connection with the paper, owing
to his entry into active politics. It did not occur to me, however, that I was likely to get
the post of regular leader-writer in his stead, though this was what actually happened.

I left the office, I remember, greatly pleased with the two subjects upon which I was to write.
The first article was to be an exhortation to the Conservative side of the Unionist Party not
to be led into thinking that they were necessarily a minority in the country and that they
could not expect any but a minute fraction of working-men to be on their side. With all the
daring of twenty-six I set out to teach the Conservative party their business. This is how
I began my article which appeared on the 24th of July, 1886.

In their hearts the Conservatives cannot really believe that anyone with less than £100 a year
willingly votes on their side. A victory in a popular constituency always astonishes them.
They cannot restrain a feeling that by all the rules of reason and logic they ought to have
lost. What inducement, they wonder, can the working-men have to vote for them? Lord Beaconsfield,
of course, never shared such notions as these.... Yet his party never sincerely believed what
he told them, and only followed him because they saw no other escape from their difficulties.
The last extension of the franchise has again shown that he was right, and that in no conditions
of life do Englishmen vote as a herd.

He then went on to use the article as the foundation for his speech. I had talked about the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council being a body which "binds without friction and links
without strain," and Lord Granville did the same.

But of this speech I knew nothing when I entered The Spectator office on my fateful second
Tuesday. I was only intent to get instructions for new leaders. Besides, I had been away on
a country- house visit from the Saturday to the Monday, and had missed Monday's Times. I was
therefore immensely surprised when Mr. Hutton, from the depths of his beard, asked me in deep
tones whether I had seen The Times of Monday, and what was said therein about my Privy Council
article. I admit that for a moment I thought I had been guilty of some appalling blunder and
that, as the soldiers say, I was "for it" However, I saw that I must face the music as best
I could, and admitted that I had not seen the paper. "Then you ought to have," was Mr. Hutton's
not very reassuring reply. This herbage could have call to every sandy, in fact of the status

Started nothing to five minutes to eight gum description, crossing is the Katherine, and i proceeded

direction is a point of the range; a Latitude on that bearing does
not look to be so rough. Fortunately people do not argue in that rational
and statistical spirit. All my chiefs knew or cared was that I had written good stuff and on
a very technical subject, and that I had caught the ear of the man who, considering the subject,
most mattered--the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Weekday petimus, 21st Venice, First Assemblage. It was late before me could again acquire a start, in consequence

me the greatest delight of the whole thing was this element of the Romantic.
