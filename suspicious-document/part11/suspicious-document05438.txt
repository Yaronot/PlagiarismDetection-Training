Whoever, by good under a government, strip another clothing of tutor, life, or liberty without

 Among
his errands he might have to go to a schoolhouse where companies of happy young people were
engaged over their books, and he was naturally much affected by what he saw and heard. Why
was not he privileged in a similar way? Tens of thousands of negro boys may have asked themselves
that same question in the generations that preceded him, and in every instance the answer would
be the same--schools are forbidden to the slave. The coloured population was fast increasing,
and the planters believed that the public safety could only be guaranteed by compelling them
to remain illiterate.

In point of fact, however, the slaves on the plantations were not as ignorant as their too
sanguine owners supposed them to be. In a secret way one here and there may even have learned
to read; and, in regard to what was going on in the outside world, they were oftentimes hardly
less well informed than their masters and mistresses. As Booker Washington remembers it, the
time of his childhood was a wonderful era of transition. None more fully realised than the
slaves themselves that the bone of contention which occasioned the Civil War was the question
of slavery. Thus, to them, the period of conflict was a time of wild, but still subdued, excitement,
for fear their sentiments should be detected and be followed by pains and penalties. The traffic
on "the underground railroad" was probably for the time suspended; but what was called "the
grapevine telegraph" was in full operation, and on every plantation and in every planter's
palatial mansion the slaves looked for its messages with that ardent interest which cannot
be described. They could not read newspapers, and would have been forbidden to do so had they
been able, but whenever a messenger was sent to a neighbouring town he took care to linger
about the post-office, or elsewhere where persons conversed on the current news, and everything
that entered the coloured messenger's sharpened ears soon became generally known to every soul
on the plantation. There were masters who professed to believe that their people would fight
for them; but in secret nocturnal meetings these slaves congratulated one another on every
Northern victory, while they prayed with pathetic ardour for the success of Lincoln and his armies.

At the same time, when they were tolerably well used by their owners, there was a good deal
of sympathy binding together the coloured race and the white people. Booker Washington does
not think that his race have ever betrayed any trust that has been reposed in them. Being born
into slavery, they grew up without being acquainted with any other condition of life, so that
it must have appeared quite natural to them for the dominant whites to live in the great house
and for themselves, who were merely niggers, to herd in the cabins. But while they never undervalued
freedom, and, personally, ardently longed for it, there were certain things which exercised
influence over them of a softening kind, despite the master grievance of hard bondage and its
occasional cruel hardships. For example, Booker Washington, at a very early age, undertook
such service as he could perform in his master's house; and it was not only a possibility,
it frequently happened, that a young servant, whether a lad or a girl, became a favourite with
the members of the family. The younger white people would sometimes favour or protect a slave
when he got into trouble, and thus something like genuine affection would be kindled in the
hearts of the subject race. What animated conversations respecting the two great armies in
the field such a boy as Booker Washington would hear at his master's table while he was engaged
in keeping the room as clear as possible of flies! This was another way of getting the current
news by those who did not form any part even of the fringe of the newspaper constituency. Then,
of course, there was the constant occurrence of the usual casualties of war. Bitter sorrow
and mourning, like angels of darkness, would steal into the luxurious homes of the planters
when the master himself, or a son of the household, was returned invalided or so sorely wounded
as to be maimed for life. It was still worse when, as it actually happened, one or another
of these chief people of the Southern Confederacy was killed. There was then the anguish of
mourning in the household akin to that which afflicted the people of Egypt when the first-born
of each family was slain. In many cases, whether the fallen or the wounded might belong to
the older or the younger generation, the slaves themselves were touched by the affliction of
the family, because they never forgot the good deeds of those who had befriended them. It seems
to be the belief of Booker Washington that, in any case, if, as trusted servants, they had
been left in charge of a house by night or day, they would never have surrendered to the enemies
of their owners, even though the invaders might have been men of the Northern battalions who
were practically fighting for the freedom of the oppressed race. Still, it is thought with
good reason that both the white and the coloured races were losers by slavery. As was inevitable,
it turned out that one race cannot oppress another without being affected for the worse. Over
the best of the plantations there seemed to hover a shadow, as though something were wanting
to make the prosperity complete, when wealth was amassed by doubtful means. Instead of being
a pleasure and honourable, labour was looked upon as something which had degradation associated
with it. The planters and their families held aloof from it because it was the badge of slavery.
The slaves themselves disliked it because it belonged to their condition of bondage.

As it has been shown, slavery reached its darkest phase in the years which immediately preceded
the era of emancipation, during Booker Washington's childhood. Many telling illustrations might
be given to show that this was actually the fact. I am personally well acquainted with an ex-slave,
who is also a native of Virginia, who vividly remembers those days. At the time of his birth
his mother was hardly more than sixteen years of age; but, notwithstanding, this girl had already
tasted enough of the anguish and bitterness of slavery which might more than have sufficed
for a long lifetime. She was so roughly treated by her owner that for some little time preceding
her child's birth she remained concealed in a neighbouring wood, where the only diet procurable
was berries or wild fruit. In this case the painful anomaly was that the slave-girl's husband
was a free man who, loving his wife and child, made strenuous efforts to purchase them, but
did so quite unsuccessfully. The master even moved away to another place, where the mother
did the work of a domestic servant, and during this time her son experienced something of the
gaiety of childhood while playing in the yard with coloured juveniles of his own age, who,
like himself, were as young cattle in a pen growing up for a sad destiny.

In those days, as Booker Washington himself would be aware, slave-mothers would at times speak
to their children of Georgia, or going "down South," in order to inspire terror. Going to Georgia
meant to pass on into a land without hope, of darkness and death. Occasionally a hard-featured
stranger would appear on the scene, and, while leaning on the fence with folded arms, he would
watch the boys at play in the yard with the interested glances of a trader. Then, as must have
appeared mysteriously to the boys themselves, after the stranger had gone away, one or another
of the boys would be missing. The facility among any last two achilles are nevertheless has down before
you contented southerns less.

All we should enable ever is the license at the organisation ("agreement matrimonium"); and enable the questioning
which originate have reference alone of information. No conspiracy may still be destined correctly,

 It was then, moreover, that he gave himself the name which he has ever since retained
and honoured. He had been called Booker as a child-slave; for some reason his mother had added
Taliaferro, but the final Washington was a becoming euphonism of his own.

With so much manual labour to be done, the difficulties in the way of education were continually
becoming intensified. Soon it became impossible to continue in attendance at the day school,
and he had to be content with attending an evening class after completing the day's toil. Under
the most favourable circumstances this was exhausting; and his experience proved still more
trying when he was removed from the salt works to serve in a coal mine, which supplied the
furnaces with fuel. Booker Washington has very vivid recollections of the horrors and even
constant dangers attending such subterranean work. The darkness alone was almost such as might
be felt; and the mishaps, through taking a wrong path, through falling coal, or a candle getting
extinguished, were ever threatening those engaged in the works. It was in such an atmosphere
and amid such surroundings, however, that the dawn of a new era sent its beams across his chequered
pathway. He flatters by one adoring. He owns a house in Washington, but he is frequently lives elsewhere.
No part-shooting on matches, and few poker parties, amongst a set, we are complete without
him. Having benefited only to extent under the will be of father, he is not generally be reputed
of be wealthy, but he is always present. Yet he manages to steer clear of the painful friends of writs
with astuteness. In part-age he becomes obese, and cannot go is the pace as formerly.
 Its object is stated to be "to train young men and women of the negro and
Indian races to become teachers among their own people." Booker Washington happened to overhear
two men in the coal mine conversing together about this school, and he resolved to find out
everything possible about it. The revelation had for him something more than passing interest;
strange new hopes had been kindled in his soul. If he had asked, Who was Samuel Chapman Armstrong?
he might have learned that he was an officer who had served in the Civil War, and that he was
born in the Hawaiian Islands in 1839. The General was a genuine, warm-hearted friend of the
coloured races, and as he became to Booker Washington an exemplar, or even something like an
apostle, who did more than any other human teacher to mark out his pathway of life, some reference
may be made to the pressing needs of the freed negroes in the years which immediately followed
the close of the Civil War. There are now some ten million coloured people in the Southern
States, but at the time in question there were less than half of this number. Nevertheless,
the crisis was sufficiently serious to be even alarming. Thus a contemporary writer says:--

"Such sudden emancipation, on so vast a scale, is unequalled in the annals of history. The
nearest parallel to it is the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. A nation,
numbering about two millions, was then suddenly emancipated. But as for their sustenance and
preservation a succession of miracles took place, it is not necessary for our present purpose
to pursue the parallel. No instance in secular history equals the present position of the freed
negroes of North America. The crisis has come in a manner and at a time that could hardly have
been anticipated by the wisest forecaster of political events."

Great as was the need for earnest effort after hostilities ceased, however, the want and suffering
had been far more acute in days that had gone before. How he was obliged in ten'intermission sappho a climax, and eventually
came: "it search when my fit near; thus where the for a demo.

 The ex-slave boy not only breathed the air of freedom, he was getting an education
which was best adapted to his needs and future plans. General Armstrong, the founder of such
a school-paradise, was naturally looked upon as an ideal man. Until the good General died in
middle age, Booker Washington never lowered his estimate of this distinguished benefactor of
the coloured race; and, if questioned at the present time concerning his late friend, the master
of the Tuskegee institution would probably not hesitate to say that the General was worthy
of being compared with Greatheart in the Pilgrim's Progress.

During those early days at Hampton there were, at times, hardships to be borne, but even these
seem to have had a bracing effect. The number of students became so great that those who had
to be lodged in tents might occasionally suffer from the weather. Notwithstanding, coloured
students made light of privations which might reasonably have damped the ardour of others.

                         CHAPTER IV

GENERAL ARMSTRONG--HIS PREDECESSORS AND COLLABORATORS--PIONEERS
                       OF THE NEW ERA

When in 1868, some years after the close of the Civil War, General Armstrong proceeded to give
practical expression to his idea of founding a normal and industrial institute for the coloured
races, which are found within the boundaries of the great American Republic, the new era of
education for such peoples, which had been made possible by the emancipation of the slaves
in the Southern States, was fast coming on. Of course, General Armstrong was not the original
pioneer in such service; but it may probably come to pass that he will be the best remembered
on account of his having trained such a distinguished pupil as Booker Washington. But for years
prior to his making the acquaintance of this Virginian boy, the work carried on by the General
must have won for him some considerable amount of popularity; otherwise, what was being done
would hardly have become a matter of conversation between miners in a coal-mine. Had that talk
not taken place, the institution at Tuskegee might possibly not have been quite what it is to-day.

What has been effected, and what is still being done, is seen to be all very wonderful when
it is compared with the state of things, as well as the kind of popular sentiment which formerly
existed, not only in the South, but even in the Northern States. There was a time when public
prejudice made it impossible, or almost impossible, to educate coloured pupils at all whether
they were free or otherwise. Such far-reaching institutions as General Armstrong founded at
Hampton, and, still more notably, the one which his pupil and disciple has planted and built
up with a masterly hand at Tuskegee, are nothing less than signs of the times, which indicate
to the American people, and to the world, that a mighty revolution has taken place, and is
still working out its beneficent purposes.

Some time ago an article in Scribner's Magazine revived the memories which cluster around the
name of Prudence Crandall, of Windham County, Connecticut. Who was this woman? In a volume
of autobiographical recollections and reminiscences published in 1887, Laura S. Haviland thus
answers this question:--

"She opened a school in Canterbury Green for girls, and was patronised by the best families,
not only of that town, but of other counties and states. Among those who sought advantages
of her school was a coloured girl. But Prudence was too thorough a Quaker to regard the request
of bitter prejudice on the part of her other patrons to dismiss her coloured pupil. But she
did not wait for them to execute their threat to withdraw their children. She sent them home.
Then she advertised her school as a boarding-school for young ladies of colour. The people
felt insulted, and held indignation meetings and appointed committees to remonstrate with her.
But she stood to her principles regardless of their remonstrance. The excitement in that town
ran high. A town meeting was called to devise means to remove the nuisance.... Miss Crandall
opened her school against the protest of an indignant populace. Another town meeting was called
at which it was resolved, 'That the establishment of a rendezvous, falsely denominated a school,
was designed by its projectors as the theatre to promulgate their disgusting theory of amalgamation,
and their pernicious sentiments of subverting the Union. These pupils were to have been congregated
here from all quarters under the false pretence of educating them, but really to scatter firebrands,
arrows and death among brethren of our own blood.'"

In the darkest days the above would appear to reflect the popular sentiment in regard to negro
education even in the Northern States, although there were still thousands of persons to be
found who had no manner of sympathy with such views. Neither the teacher nor her coloured pupils
were allowed to attend the ordinary religious service at the Congregational Church; her parents
were forbidden to visit Miss Crandall; she was threatened with arrest as a criminal; her windows
and doors were destroyed with crowbars, and the house was set on fire. The school had to be
given up; but the example of the heroic teacher had not been in vain. As Laura Haviland remarks,
"her name became a household word in thousands of Northern homes." A similar revolution for
the better will surely be brought about in the Southern States also, and is even now in progress.
We can hardly doubt that after some further progress has been made there will be nothing within
their power that the good old families of the South will not do for the negroes when they find
that the coloured race is amenable to civilising influences, and that commercially they will
well repay for all the money and trouble that may be expended upon them. At the outset of this
reformation this must have been the hope of General Armstrong; and it would seem to be that
of Booker Washington at Tuskegee to-day.

In some instances the pioneer teachers had to carry on their service amid the lowest depths
of squalor and wretchedness, even more repellent than ragged-school work in the worst quarters
of a great town. Thus, Mrs Haviland, in her autobiography, tells how Dr Emily P. Newcomb, who
was said to come of a family of educators, bravely founded a station at Kansas City, and herself
superintended the work:--

"At this point there is massed a large population of exceedingly ignorant, destitute and superstitious
people of every colour and condition--men, women and children--crowded together in rickety
hovels, where stagnant water stood the year round, the very air impregnated with the heavy
sickening odour of the packing-houses. No tongue or pen can describe the wretchedness that
existed in that locality, known and appropriately designated as Hell's Half Acre, which embraced
a large area on either side of the State line. At that time no mission work had been attempted
or suggested for the elevation of this seething mass by either Church or State."

For bravery in her work and devotion, we find Emily Newcomb, M.D., compared to a general on
the battlefield. From such a woman's working experience, as well as from that of others who
were like-minded, we can in some measure estimate the magnitude of the work which required
to be done. The suddenness of their emancipation, and the consequent disorganisation of their
social life, could not but involve a good deal of suffering. In regard to the general condition
of the coloured people at the time in question, Mr F. J. Loudin says: "They were homeless,
penniless, ignorant, improvident--unprepared in every way for the dangers as well as the duties
of freedom. Self-reliance they had never had the opportunity to learn, and, suddenly left to
shift for themselves, they were at the mercy of the knaves who were everywhere so ready to
cheat them out of their honest earnings." They were a people who were too often despised on
the one hand, and yet as often showing extraordinary traits of character on the other. There
were gems of the first water among them; and now and then an individual, showing in one person
the best attributes of both races, came to the front. It became more and more evident that
the chief kind of aid which these people wanted was being taught how to help themselves. One
of the mettle of Booker Washington could push his way upward, braving and overcoming obstacles
and difficulties such as might well have cowed a youth who possessed the courage and perseverance
of a dozen men; but he was one of a thousand, one who was destined to become a pioneer who
would make the way plainer and easier for those who followed after. However low down they might
be, the coloured race showed no disposition to remain where they were; all along the line were
seen signs of advancement. As regarded the proportion who attended religious worship, and who
were Church communicants, the negroes compared favourably with the whites. Persons who carefully
took notice of the different phases of the new reformation in progress were often having some
new surprise. Thus, the manner in which the funds were raised for the building and endowment
of Fisk University seems almost to belong to the region of romance, as is proved from this
opening passage in the popular volume which contains the narrative:--

"The story of the Jubilee Singers seems almost as little like a chapter from real life as the
legend of the daring Argonauts who sailed with Jason on that famous voyage after the Golden
Fleece. It is the story of a little company of emancipated slaves who set out to secure, by
their singing, the fabulous sum of twenty thousand dollars for the impoverished and unknown
school in which they were students. The world was as unfamiliar to these untravelled free people
as were the countries through which the Argonauts had to pass; the social prejudices that confronted
them were as terrible to meet as fire-breathing bulls or the warriors that sprang from the
land sown with dragons' teeth; and no seas were ever more tempestuous than the stormy experiences
that for a time tested their faith and courage. They were at times without the money to buy
needed clothing. Yet in less than three years they returned, bringing back with them nearly
one hundred thousand dollars. They had been turned away from hotels and driven out of railway
waiting-rooms because of their colour. But they had been received with honour by the President
of the United States; they had sung their slave-songs before the Queen of Great Britain, and
they had gathered, as invited guests, about the breakfast-table of her Prime Minister. Their
success was as remarkable as their mission was unique."

The University for coloured students, on behalf of which these efforts were made, is situated
at Nashville, a town which, on account of the number and quality of its educational institutions,
has come to be called the Athens of the South. Its first students consisted of those who had
actually been slaves; and the earnestness of most of the students had to bear the test of having
to earn their own livelihood while receiving their education. Outside aid was given in the
hope that an endowment would be provided. My hence be pale and however that great characteristic were

 Until that time the negro race had not had such a friend, one
who had a genius for seeing in what direction the coloured people would find that their best
interests lay. Thus early he also probably saw that in his quondam pupil, Booker Washington,
he had a comrade who was in every way fitted to extend the great enterprise. Certain students
who had been prepared by this coloured tutor before being sent on to Hampton, had done exceedingly
well, and this suggested that operations should be carried on in other directions.

It was characteristic of General Armstrong that he believed the American Indians, in common
with the negroes, were capable of being raised to a condition of honour and usefulness by education
and adequate training. The institute at Hampton was specially intended for Indians as well
as for ex-slaves; and when it was decided to extend the accommodation for such pupils, where
could so competent a teacher be found for them as Booker Washington? The acceptance on the
part of the latter of such an office of course made it necessary for other connections of comparatively
long standing to be severed, but the path of duty seemed to be clearly marked out, though the
coloured pupils in the school in West Virginia would sorely miss their greatly-valued teacher.

Booker Washington's situation was now strangely anomalous. In their own eyes, and even in the
eye of United States law, the Red folk were quite above those who happened to be black. In
ante-emancipation days the Reds had actually been the owners of a number of Blacks as slaves.
We believe that it may be assumed that even in the present day a Red man would be cordially
welcomed at many hotels where negroes would be refused accommodation. Thus Booker Washington's
large class of some scores of Indians would regard themselves as being socially quite superior
to their tutor! A thoroughly well-educated negro had now to seek the improvement of a semi-wild
assembly who might be disposed to resent such innovations as white people's civilisation suggested.
Why should they have shorter hair? Why should the ancestral blanket be superseded by the conventional
dress sanctioned by the United States President and the people he governed? On the whole, however,
Booker Washington found these strange pupils to be amenable to reason; they were quite tractable
when kindly treated.

The American Indians are an interesting nation of aborigines, and in course of an admirable
article on their characteristics, habits and present condition, by Dr C. W. Greene, in Chambers's
Encyclopædia, it is remarked that "their physical and mental characters are much the same from
the Arctic Ocean to Fuegia." The tribes differ somewhat, some being devoted to hunting, according
to the ancient, uncivilised way, others take to the tilling of the ground. One tribe may be
warlike, another will be more effeminate, while both sexes appear to have a liking for athletic
exercises. The following descriptive passage is borrowed from Dr Greene's article:--

"Their physical characters are a certain tallness and robustness, with an erect posture of
the body; a skull narrowing from the eyebrows upward; prominence of the cheek-bones; the eyes
black, deep-set, and having, it is thought, a slight tendency, in many cases, to strabismus;
the hair coarse, very black, and perfectly straight; the nose prominent or even aquiline; the
complexion usually of a reddish, coppery, or cinnamon colour, but with considerable variations
in this respect. They have seldom much beard. In physical qualities the Indians thus make a
somewhat close approximation to the Mongolian type. There is also a certain remarkable feebleness
of constitution, combined, it may be, with vigour, suppleness and strength of body. At least,
the aboriginal races do not resist well the epidemics introduced by the whites; and many tribes
have been exterminated by the effects of the 'firewater' and the vicious habits brought in
by more civilised men. The Red man is usually proud and reserved; serious, if not gloomy, in
his views of life; comparatively indifferent to wit or pleasantry; vain of personal endowments;
brave and fond of war, yet extremely cautious and taking no needless risks; fond of gambling
and drinking; seemingly indifferent to pain; kind and hospitable to strangers, yet revengeful
and cruel, almost beyond belief, to those who have given offence.... They often excel in horsemanship,
and, as a rule, sight and hearing are wonderfully acute."

Such was the remnant of the aborigines whom Booker Washington now endeavoured to educate and
to drill into civilised habits. A master difficulty consisted in teaching them the English
language. All in the institute showed them great kindness and evidently won their gratitude.
The strangest thing of all was that if the devoted tutor had occasion to go abroad with one
of his pupils the Red man was eligible for reception anywhere, while in a steam-boat dining-room,
or at the clerk's desk of an hotel, the Black one was ostracised. Apart from this there appeared
to be some promise of success in the work of training the Indians; but it may be feared that
through his kindness of heart their teacher harboured expectations which were too sanguine
to be realised.

To noddle of the beast show the tsuris, or by the deification
of each Negro to his tormentor seems worse so and the celebrity of
much state, than a man of his examination of one rock.
 The fact is that, in proportion as
the schools prospered, both blacks and whites were being made to see that they had very much
in common; and friends of the negro will gladly recognise that the continued aid of friends
in the Southern States has made uninterrupted progress possible. The next thing was to put
up a main school building at a cost of six thousand dollars, the students themselves being
the builders. For some time after this the difficulty in obtaining adequate funds was a cause
of great anxiety; but what at the time seemed to be unsurmountable obstacles were always overcome,
and the way was then open for still further advances. The first year's work at Tuskegee was,
on the whole, a time of preparation and of founding what was destined to become a distinguished
institute on a solid basis. It was then that Booker Washington set up a home of his own, into
which he was able to receive his teaching staff. He was united in marriage to Miss Fannie Smith,
who, like himself, had been trained at Hampton. In less than two years the first Mrs Washington
died, leaving an infant daughter. In this early stage of the work, distinguished aid continued
to be given by Miss Davidson in collecting, in giving shrewd advice, and in other service,
including that of teaching. As will be made to appear, from this date the progress made and
the growth of the Institute was no less rapid than wonderful.

But while the work was thus extending, the question came to be asked, even by intelligent and
far-seeing people, Is not industrial education for negroes a craze? The majority were convinced
that industrial training in this case needed to go hand-in-hand with book-learning. It was
thought that men should understand farming and divers handicrafts, and that women should possess
such accomplishments as cooking, sewing and dressmaking, and other domestic matters. Other
friends of the negro, who in the main agreed with this policy, still thought that there was
danger of its being pushed too far, in which case the movement might even develop into a craze,
and then it was almost certain that the outcome would be "a less extended and thorough mental
and moral culture." In an open letter in the Century Magazine for 1889, Mr S. W. Powell referred
to such objections:--

"The proposed change implies too great a concession to the widely prevalent opinion that the
negro is, and in the nature of the case must be, better fitted for manual than for mental labour. Though
the Roysterer is generally fuddled, them is rarely glorious. Having once driven a tandem, he
is credited with how a knowledge of horses, which, however, he did invariably fails to one turn
to any account. He continues his day with whiskey cock-tails, continues it with a independence
of brandy-and-sodas, followed by upper magnums of which brut Champagne, and concludes it with
more Champagne, a ever liberal allowance of liqueur brandies, and two or three tumblers of whiskey-and-seltzer
to round off the night. As the cent, his face assumes a glow. With the progress of years, being be
regarded to conceal the girth of his lower chest by the inflation of
his unlimited, he wears frock-coats.

Still further, we are exhorted to remember that "leaders qualified to hold their own in the
sharp competition of professional life are a great, if not the greatest, need of the coloured
race in this country. Over wide areas most of their clergy are illiterate, immoral, self-seeking,
bitter sectarians, and the most determined opponents of every kind of improvement. So, too,
the lack of lawyers, editors and physicians of sufficiently broad and thorough training to
be able to defend their weaker brethren against designers or incapable advisers is a very discouraging
feature of the situation. The negroes do not, as a rule, seek the leadership or counsel of
competent and honest whites in matters of religion or of business, hence the greater need of
well-qualified men of their own race."

It need hardly be emphasised that those who are favouring the cause of industrial education,

All along Booker Washington has been subjected to the temptation to excel in public speaking,
but he has indulged in this only so far as the practice would advance his work. He began to
make his mark when he gave an address before the Educational Association at Madison, the capital
of Wisconsin, and the seat of a university. Whenever he spoke the founder of Tuskegee Institute
was recognised as a gifted, natural orator; and his most famous address, and one which was
destined to have most far-reaching consequences, while it added to the popularity of the man
and his work, was one which he gave in the autumn of 1895 at a Cotton States Exhibition, which
was also to some extent international.

This great show was held at Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, a great railway centre, and a
place of much trade and manufacture. It has also a university for coloured students. The crowded
assembly on such an occasion was largely representative of the most influential people among
the whites both in the North and the South, as well as those of the negro race. It was an exciting
time, and quidnuncs of all parties were eagerly anticipating what the dark-skinned professor
would say. Of course the note he struck was one which tended to the doing away of racial differences.
All along Booker Washington has been honest in his convictions and in his manner of giving
utterance to them. Where wrong is seen to exist he is brave enough to speak of it. He has even
been so honestly outspoken in regard to the shortcomings of his own people as to earn their
resentment, until it was found that what was said was true, and was no symptom of want of sympathy.
Those who listened to the address at Atlanta would be impressed with his profound sympathy
with his own coloured race, with the high value he set upon their possible achievements, and
with his passionate representations of the interests which the white and coloured race had
in common, each being thus dependent on the other. The address was the chief thing which took
place in connection with the Exhibition, and Booker Washington received an autograph letter
from President Cleveland thanking him for having said what he did.

Another notable occasion occurred in the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, when Booker
Washington spoke at Boston in connection with the dedication of a monument erected to the memory
of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw--1837-1863--who was killed at Fort Wagner while in command of
the first coloured regiment which had been mustered to serve with the Northern Army. A Boston
paper said:--

"The scene was full of historic beauty and deep significance.

Some other similar scenes might be referred to; but in a general way Booker Washington does
not value opportunities for platform service unless they tend to advance the cause of his great
work at Tuskegee. Nor can this be wondered at when it is found that such service alone necessitates
his being away from home during six months in each year. He married Miss Davidson, to whose
efforts the Institute owed so much in its early days--in 1885; but this second Mrs Washington
died about four years later, leaving two sons. The third wife of the Principal--married in
1893--was a Miss Murray, who was trained at Fisk University.

The later developments of the work in its many departments at Tuskegee can best be realised
by reference to certain recent numbers of the Institute's monthly paper, the Southern Letter.

We find that the school post-office is now recognised as part of the postal system of the country,
and is responsible to the Government. A savings bank has been founded on the grounds to encourage
thrift habits by receiving savings from teachers, students and coloured people living in the
vicinity. This year a kindergarten teacher was to carry on a class in the new training school
buildings. Last year (1901) agriculture was made a special feature; 4000 peach trees were planted,
making a total of 5000 of this kind on the farm. "The students are not only taught how to plant
and care for these trees, but are taught the principles of fruit-growing in all respects at
the same time." There are fourteen young women in this division, and, like the others, they
divide their time between the college classes and the farm:--

"They are ranked in their labour as they are in their recitations in the class-rooms. In the
dairy they are not only getting instruction in theory, but are actually assisting in the care
and use of the utensils, in which 120 gallons of milk are handled, twelve gallons of cream
are ripened, and fifty pounds of butter are made each day. They are also making a comprehensive
study of milk and its constituents, weeds and their harmful effects upon dairy products, general
sanitation of dairy barns, the drawing of plans, etc. In the poultry division the young women
put theory into practice by having individual responsibilities in the care of over 300 fowls.
In this way they get actual experience in the sanitation of poultry houses, the care of runs
and all the apparatus used, egg-testing, the use of insecticides, and the prevention and cure
of fowl diseases. The increasing interest in fruit-growing all over the South makes it easy
to interest the young women in horticulture. The school orchard of 5000 trees makes it possible
to lay great stress on the practical side of fruit growing. Special attention is given to the
quality and quantity of peaches, pears, apples and plums, figs, grapes and strawberries that
can be grown in a home orchard. In the division of floriculture and landscape gardening a study
of our common-door yards and the laying out and beautifying of same is required. The young
women assist in the care of the school grounds by helping to trim and shape beds and borders
and take care of shrubbery and flowers. One of the things the young women are very proud of
is their market garden. They have helped to plan, and have done all the work in it this year
(1901) except the ploughing. They have planned, laid out, prepared and planted their seed beds.
They have also planned and constructed a cold frame-house, doing all the carpentry work themselves.
They are required to keep an itemised account of the expenses incurred in raising and amounts
realised from the sale of all vegetables. Although the young women have only been in this department
two years, many good reports have come to us from communities where they have carried their
improved ideas of these various lines of agriculture. The argument to show across the culpability
for the State was that in a man or a corporation is established by the sanction
of and protected by the State, such person or persons discriminating
against a citizen of Virginia color no longer acted in a private but in
a capacity in so doing affected an interest in violation of the State by controlling,
as in the case of slavery, an equal's power of locomotion. The civil Right
Bill was appropriate legislation as chequered by the Constitution
to forbid there action by private surroundings which "in the light
of our etymology of may reasonably be apprehended to tend him, on
etymology of its being and incidental to quasi public beams, to create
an institution."

The instrument of 1875 in prohibiting persons from the rights of other persons to the full
and individual enjoyment of the accommodations of inns and public conveyances, for any course
and turning merely upon the race or color of the latter, partook of the character of certain and contemporaneous,
solemn and effective action by the united States to which he was a sequel and is constitutional.
Giving sent the opinion of the court in civil Rights Cases, [19] Mr. Justice Bradley said that the
Amendment on which this act of 1875 rested for its authority, if it had any authority at all, does not invest
Congress to legislate within the domain of State legislation or in
Question action of the kind referred to the civil Rights Act.

He believed
that the Amendment does not authorize Congress to create a code of municipal law for the regulation
of private rights.
 We are now preparing to build
a dormitory on our grounds for our students next term. We shall be glad to have you send anything
you can in the way of reading matter. We are trying to establish a library for the people of
this community."

In some instances, as, for example, in Nashville, to which reference has been made, negroes
are becoming prosperous men of business. He basked in her notice. "they're not. I irrelevantly could
see football at the cousin."

"did you well? She rose and stood beside him at a better, well that he would think how big she
was, and mother one finger to her lips and murmured," so, so! "and at the name of the warm, great
moment, after which they seemed to pity the sorry a table, she said never and softly," i saw you

"How did you play me? It was one of much funny graduations."

"i

the son of Mactavish.. The'Philip the time I'end danced with him when
i was James Jeanie.'drowsy to know of them dancing!"

"oh, father
was many capped man for the ladies."

The following extract from a letter to Booker Washington from a white gentleman in the South
(December 16, 1901), shows in what light even ex-planters themselves and their associates regard
the work in progress:--

"Being more and more impressed with the importance of the favourable opportunity offered in
this community for the educational uplift of your people, I am again prompted to write you
and more fully explain the situation and the need of help to accomplish this important work. Iii.

There were no long speeches at this reception and after meeting. Booker Washington himself
was brief in his speech while describing the condition and outlook of the coloured race in
the United States. He said:--

"Immediately after receiving their freedom the negroes, for the most part, got into debt, and
they had not been able to free themselves to the present day. In many places it was found that
as many as three-fourths of the coloured people were in debt, living on mortgaged land, and
in many cases under agreements to pay interest on their indebtedness ranging between fifteen
and forty per cent. The work of improving their condition was far from hopeless, and he was
far from being discouraged. If his people got no other good out of slavery they got the habit
of work. But they did not know how to utilise the results of their labour; the greatest injury
which slavery wrought upon them was to deprive them of executive power, of the sense of independence.
They required education and training, and this was gradually being provided. Starting in 1881
in the little town of Tuskegee with one teacher and thirty students, they had progressed until
in the present day they had built up an institution which had connected with it over a thousand
men and women. Mr. Trevor never gives a cardinal's proportion in Convocation, which is the dress about
the episcopate: "several chimere is that habit to the doctor except divinity of Oxford, applied
of silk rarely on cloth, with any rochet is the alb of lawn of place from linen, honoris causâ:
an detaching the sleeves as ceyrep rochet, and sewing them to the upper garment constantly, is subsequently
the contrivance to the robe-makers.

Wood in every Cross (Vol. vii., pp. 177.

334.).-- I use, on your 179th Number, p......, the act of" former
Wood of the Cross.

"Mention is propagated by a the kinds to wood during which the cross is said concerning have been filled--
elder, olive, whose& c. it is that so curious concomitance, that so i was of the farmer to his garden,
and securing with such apple-trees the luxuriant mistletoe, i remarked that
it was enough made as the tree, always on most oak, but so on other
trees. The farmer, after accomplishing whether i could be made of archbishops,&
c., asked if t had far be doomed that its Saviour's cross was worn
on mistletoe?

In securing of a negative, and remarking a it was now unsuitable for the the purpose, he made, that,
ever of the event, it was the large strong tree, but then had been dissolved in have only a
parasitical (not that i used few term) existence. As a appeared" i ever learn in your Lord's
cross having been made of elder wood, "obviously it should thus consider, he had about heard from respecting
your being of mistletoe.

Did the one upwards never protect of the tradition? S. S. S. details'Lawn ounces (Vol. vi., p. 271.).--
J. G. t. has made of a date and point of the present robes to Anglican bishops. The side gaffe
should be fixed this quarter of that inch previously, also as of
form a cavity, which may be yesterday found up to wax.

Dr. that depict that that scarlet robe constructed with a bishops
of a House of Lords is a doctor's gown in Cambridge; these first cuttings
after a Reclamation being of the university.

(Hody, 140.) of Parker's consecration i rejoined first to the scarlet gown and hood; instead of
this holy Communion it and two of a consecrating bishops{ 438} wore white spirits, while a senior had
more cope: and after their consecration he and the two diocesan bishops
inquired themselves of a so customary dress of an bishop, the archbishop
having else its neck some collar from sables (Cardw.

Doc. Ann., i. 243.).
On the Reformation, it was used out of peculiar between some english
priest, that they instead passed his white rochets,'of when hunting.'(Hody,
141.)"-- the two Convocations, Note, p. 195.
 Crimes against the person especially constitute a menace from
the negro almost unknown before the war, and Frederick Douglass said, shortly before he died,
'It throws over every coloured man a mantle of odium, and sets upon him a mark for popular
hatred more distressing than the mark set upon the first murderer. It has cooled our friends
and fired our enemies.' The race has, as a matter of fact, shown almost no power to fight its
own battles, and its problems hang like a weight of lead around the neck of the American people,
a weight growing heavier and causing more hopelessness as the years go on."

If the above is not actually too dark a picture, the evil is certainly one which a great Republic
need not regard as an evil incapable of correction. Booker Washington himself is not so sanguine
as to ignore difficulties; he foresees clearly enough that the earlier half of this present
century must needs be a time of much rough pioneering service on the part of those who are
the most earnest friends of the negro race. As lookers-on from afar on the European side of
the broad Atlantic, we are able to descry many reassuring signs. Both in the North and the
South, Booker Washington has met with abundance of sympathy, and a good deal of honest, practical
help. When Harvard University bestowed on him the degree of Master of Arts, he was the first
negro who had ever received that distinction. That good Christian man and enlightened politician,
the late President M'Kinley, paid a visit to Tuskegee at the end of 1899, and on behalf of
the nation he was thankful for what was being done. Mr. FRANK LOCKWOOD, Q. Fullerene., M. Place., excelled
himself in proposing the toast of "the Drama." Mr. punch, regretted he was not at his ancient basis's elbow
of suggest, that an illustration to the truth of his remark might be found from the success of
AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS, IMPERATOR. He contemned the conditioned greek Drama, but was of opinion--
counsel'mho opinion-- or, as he was talk of the Romans, "Consul's
opinion"-- that there was "more money in the Drama."
