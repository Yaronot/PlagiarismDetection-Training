When it was appreciated that the original quarters of the school were too limited, the Board
of Administrators went to work with great enthusiasm and in a few months collected the requisite
money and bought a large business loft building at 209-213 East 23d Street, at an expense of
$175,000. To put it in order for work cost $5,000 in addition. The former equipment was used
and $5,000 more was spent for such needed items as: machines, $3,200; motor, $352; perforating
machine, $38; additional master clocks, $233; chairs and tables, $850. The school is furnished
in a simple, businesslike manner, the equipment merely reproducing good workroom requirements,
i. e., essentials only.

The budget for the first year, 1902-1903, was $22,094.16, of which the salaries for teachers
took about one-half and the rent and maintenance covered the other half. During this year there
were 113 students admitted. In 1908-1909, after six years of rapid growth, the educational
budget is $49,000, or more than double the original, of which the salaries are $38,806; the
supplies, $1,710; printing and publishing, $600; maintenance, $9,900. At the beginning of 1908
there were 254 students in the school; 689 were registered during the year, making a total
of 943 girls, being almost nine times the number in attendance during the first year.

The Support

The Manhattan Trade School has depended for its support entirely upon voluntary contributions.
There have been few large donations and the donors represent all classes of the community--patrons
of and workers in sociological, economic, philanthropic, and educational fields, employers
of labor, and auxiliaries of many kinds of workers organized for special purposes. The most
significant help, perhaps, and the largest in proportion to its income, has been that of the
wage-earners themselves--not only the girl who has benefited by the instruction, but the general
mass of women workers. These women, knowing the difficulties in their own struggle to rise,
have shown themselves willing to set apart weekly a small sum to help young girls to attain
quickly efficiency through systematic training. The auxiliaries of wage-earners are a mainstay
of the school on account of their helpful enthusiasm, their practical suggestions, their interest
in girls trained there, and their regular subscriptions on which the Board of Administrators
can depend.

ADMINISTRATION

Admission Requirements

I. Age: fourteen to seventeen years. The law requires a child to remain in public school until
fourteen. The Manhattan Trade School has found that under fourteen a girl is too immature to
specialize in trade work, and that over seventeen most girls are too mature to fit into the
work planned for the majority of the class.

II. Public School Grade: 5-A or above. The subject matter of 5-A grade or its equivalent is
required by the state before a child can leave to work. If for illness or other good cause
a girl has not made this grade, she is admitted to the Trade School with special permission
of principal of last school attended, and, while studying her trade, the necessary amount of
schooling is made up to her by special classes and coaching. The Board of Health recognizes
this substitute.

Grade of girls admitted since beginning is shown in following table:

During 1908, 143 older women were admitted to a special workroom opened for the "unemployed."

III. Filing of working papers is required of girls under sixteen.

1. No girl under sixteen can work in New York unless she has an Employment Certificate issued
by the Board of Health, and then only from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., or for eight hours daily.

2. The public school last attended by the girl is responsible for her until she is sixteen,
or has her working papers, or is dismissed to another school. If dismissed to Manhattan Trade
School her attendance there cannot be made compulsory, and she may attend a few days and then
leave and work illegally. Our facilities for following up such cases are limited. With her
working papers on file we know she is not evading the law, and can dismiss her to work if she
is not a success in trade lines of training.

3. Exceptions: Lack of proper birth record, on account of foreign birth or failure to make
record of it by officials, may prevent the obtaining of an Employment Certificate. A special
provision is made by the Board of Health in such cases, and, pending adjustment, the girl is
admitted upon notice of date of future issuance.

IV. Reference: Some reliable person's name is required of each applying student, in order to
have some one to communicate with in case of difficulty of any kind.

V. Application in person: Each girl fills out an application blank giving name, address, and
birthplace of self, father, and mother, public school attendance, previous trade experience,
if any, trade desired, reference. This must be written at the school, for the manner in which
it is done is a large part of test for admission.

Times of Admission

The school year begins in July, but a girl is admitted any Monday when there is a vacancy in
the department she wishes to enter. The following table gives record of yearly admission:

 -------------------------+--------

Some of these students did not remain long enough to take a thorough training, for home demands
made even a small wage imperative, and the girl had to join the ranks of earners ill prepared.
Some were not adapted to trade conditions, and soon fell out by the way. Many persisted until
they took more than the average twelve months' course, and went into business at a proportionately
higher wage.

Records

I. Attendance: 1. Daily, Monday to Friday inclusive. The factory method of time cards punched
by a clock upon entrance and leaving has been adopted as being most exact, businesslike, and
time saving. It registers the exact time when rung, and so indicates tardiness as well as absence.

2. Weekly. A small filing card ruled for fifty-two weeks summarizes the daily record of time
cards and requires the marking attendance only once a week. This file is subdivided into departments
and again into classes, so that the statistics of enrollment are easily gathered.

II. Individual records: 1. Upon admission a record card is started for each girl, no matter
how long she may attend. This contains (1) the data given upon the application blank copied
in detail; (2) Student Aid, if given, amount, date, and remarks.

2. Upon leaving, entries are made on the same card of (1) date and cause of leaving; (2) record
in different departments--Art, Academic, Trade, and Health; (3) certificate--kind, record,
date. This is not granted until the pupil has proved satisfactory in her trade both in the
school and in business; (4) Trade Record--upon the reverse side of the card is the "record
in trade after leaving school," with columns for date, employer, kind of work, wages, remarks.
This is kept up by the Placement Secretary by frequent visits and letters, and gives the basis
for many valuable deductions as to the practical results of the training.

III. Other records kept in departments are (1) Student Aid: application and information; (2)
Health: examinations upon entrance and future reëxaminations; (3) Department: records of each
girl as she passes from class to class, such as "attitude," speed, and skill.

Length of Year

The school is in session forty-eight weeks each year, four weeks being given up to one-week
vacations at Christmas, Easter, Fourth of July, and Labor Day. The summer session is the beginning
of the regular work, and not a unit for summer training. No one is admitted for the summer
only, as the time is too short for real trade standards to be approached.

Tuition

The tuition is absolutely free. The Manhattan Trade School aims to reach the poorest girl who
has little chance to advance rapidly unless some one gives her a lift. In order to do this
most effectively it is sometimes necessary to assist her. (See the report of the Student Aid Work.)

Choice of Trade

A girl upon application can select the trade into which she wishes to go. If after a month's
trial she proves competent, she is allowed to continue; if not, she is advised to change to
another department or to seek employment in work not taught at the Trade School. If a girl
has no choice of trade because of ignorance of possibilities, she is shown the kinds taught
and given a chance to make a selection. If then she is undecided, she is advised to take what
seems best adapted to the time she can spend and the type of girl she appears to be.

Business Management

However simple a school is, some bookkeeping is necessary, and when with the running of the
school is combined the management of trade order supplies and receipts the problem becomes
very complicated. (See Trade Order Work.)

I. General: A system of up-to-date bookkeeping of General Ledger, Invoice Book, and Daily Exhibit,
with details worked out in Petty Cash and Maintenance Books, has been adopted. These few simple
books so distribute accounts of expense and receipts that one can soon see the standing of
the whole school or of a single department. All bookkeeping is centralized in one office, except
the taking of orders and the details of filling them, which must be in the hands of the department
concerned.

II. Departmental: 1. Requisition blanks for purchases made. 2. Order blank and duplicate for
order given by customer. 3. Time slips, wherever possible, to get exact record of time value
of work done. 4. Material slips, to keep account of what has gone into any orders. 5. Final
billing, to give data for bills sent out from main office and duplicate filed there for final
records.

THE POWER MACHINE OPERATING DEPARTMENT

Aim

To train girls to work on sewing machines run by electric power and to put a thinker behind
every machine as its operator. The department hopes by awakening intelligent interest in the
tool, i. e., the machine, to kindle ambition in the workers. It is only through the intelligent
use of the tool and consequent love of work which follows that we can look forward to supplying
the skilled machine workers of the future. This training must be given while the girls are
in the formative period, to develop habits of thought and action which will counteract the
bad effects upon the worker that follow division and subdivision of work, with consequent subdivision
of ability, which takes place in all factories today. When a pupil has been thoroughly trained
in the intelligent use of her tool, when she has learned to construct complete garments, if
she is then, through force of circumstances such as modern production entails, compelled to
carry out one process on the machine indefinitely, or to make one part of a garment, she still
holds the balance of power in being prepared to do something else when opportunity or necessity
demands.

General Steps in Training

I. A pupil must be given a short time to adjust herself to the workshop environment, consequently
she is put first at some simple work, such as ripping or cutting up old garments. This gives
her freedom while using her hands to look about the workroom and to get accustomed to the sight
as well as to the sound of machines in action.

II. The pupil is taught to control the power by which the machine is run, and is then given
an intelligent understanding of the mechanism of the machine or machines she is to operate.
