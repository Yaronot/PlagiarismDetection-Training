It was a lovely day, and the sandy ground was dry, and the congregation sat on the rough coarse
grass or perched on the sand hillocks round. As for the old boat, it was occupied by the choir,
and little Jack, having seen me safely to the spot, climbed into it and stood proudly in the
stern. He had a hymn-book in his hand, which I knew he could not read, for he was holding it
upside down, but he looked at it as long and as earnestly as if he could understand every word.
Marjorie planted herself beside me, I suppose to watch me, in case I showed signs of running
away before the service was over.

Then just before eleven, and when quite a large company of people had gathered on the green,
her father arrived. He was a man of about forty, and his face gave me the impression that he
had known trouble, and yet I fancied as I looked further at him that the trouble, whatever
it was, had ended. He seemed to me like one who has come out of a sharp storm, and has anchored
in a quiet haven. For whilst I noticed in his face the traces of heavy sorrow, still at the
same time he looked happier and more peaceful than any of those who stood round him; in fact,
it was the most restful face I had ever seen. He was not an educated man, nor was he what men
call a gentleman, and yet there was a refinement about him which made one feel at once that
he was no common man, and had no common history. His face was so interesting to me, that I
am afraid I was gazing at him instead of finding the hymn he had given out, but I was recalled
to my duty by his little daughter, who seized the hymn-book she had given me at the beginning
of the service, found the page for me, and pointed with her small finger to the place.

It was a mission hymn, sung to a wild, irregular tune. I daresay I should have smiled if I
had heard it anywhere else, but it was no laughing matter that morning. As I looked at the
brown fishermen who had taken off their oilskin caps, as I glanced at the earnest face of the
preacher, as I noticed how even children, like little Marjorie beside me, were singing with
all their heart and soul the simple plaintive words, I felt strangely solemnized.

Then came the prayer, and I felt as he prayed that One whom we could not see was standing amongst
us. It was a very simple prayer, but it was the outpouring of his heart to God, and many a
low Amen broke from the lips of the fishermen as their hearts went with his.

The sermon followed. Shall I call it a sermon? It was more an appeal than a sermon, or even
an address. There was no attempt at style, there were no long words or stilted sentences; it
was exactly what his prayer had been, words spoken out of the abundance of his earnest heart.
The prayer had contained the outpouring of his soul to his God in heaven; the words, to which
we listened afterwards contained the outpouring of his soul to us, his brothers and sisters
on earth.

There was a great hush over the congregation whilst he spoke. The mothers quieted their babes,
the children sat with their eyes fixed on the speaker; even those visitors who had been on
the outskirts of the crowd drew near to listen.

'What are you, dear friends?' he began; 'that is our subject to-day. What are you? How many
different answers I hear you make, as you answer my question in your hearts!'

'What am I?' you say. 'I am a fisherman, a strong active man, accustomed to toil and danger.'
'I am a mother, with a large family of little ones, working hard from morning till night.'
'I am a schoolboy, learning the lessons which are to fit me to make my way in the world.' 'I
am a busy merchant, toiling hard to make money, and obliged to come to this quiet place to
recruit my wearied energies.' 'I am an artist, with great ambition of future success.' 'I am
an old man, who has weathered many a storm, but my work is done now; I am too old to fish,
too tired to toil.' 'I am a gentleman of no occupation, idling comfortably through a busy world.'
'I'--and here he glanced at his own little Jack in the stern of the old boat--'I am a tiny
child, with an unknown life all before me.'

'Dear friends, such are some of your answers to my question. Can I find, do you think, one
answer, one description, which will suit you all--fishermen, mothers, boys and girls, artists,
merchants, gentlemen, the old man and the little child? Yes, I can. If I could hand you each
a piece of paper and a pencil this day, there is one description of yourself which each of
you might write, one occupation which would include you all, the old, the young, the rich and
the poor. Each of you, without exception, might write this--I am a servant.

'I, the speaker, am a servant; you who listen, all of you, are servants.'

'Well, I don't know how he is going to make that out,' I said to myself. 'I thought he was
going to say we were all sinners, and that, I suppose, we are, but servants! I do not believe
I am anybody's servant.'

'All servants,' he went on, 'but not all in the same service. As God and the angels look down
upon this green to-day they see gathering together a great company of servants, but they also
see that we are not all servants of the same master. They see what we do not see, a dividing
line between us. On one side of the line God sees, and the angels see, one company of servants--and
in God's book He gives us the name of their master--Servants of sin.

'On the other side of the line, God sees, and the angels see, another company of servants--Servants
of Christ.

'Which company do you belong to, dear friend? You fishermen on the bank there, what are you?
Little child, what are you?--a servant of sin, or a servant of Jesus Christ?

So I tried to turn it off from myself, and to forget the words which had been spoken. And whenever
the question came back to me, the question which the speaker had repeated so often, 'What are
you?' I answered it by saying to myself, 'I am a poor artist, having a holiday in Runswick
Bay, and I am not going to trouble my head with gloomy thoughts.'

Polly had prepared an excellent dinner in honour of the day, and I did full justice to it.
Then I determined to walk to Staithes, and to spend the rest of the day in seeing the country.
I had always been accustomed, to paint on Sunday, but only one of the artists seemed to be
at work, and Duncan and Polly had been so much shocked by seeing him, that I did not venture
to do the same. I enjoyed the walk along the cliffs, and came back in good spirits, having
completely shaken off, as I imagined, the remembrance of the speaker's words.

Chapter V

THE RUNSWICK SPORTS

'I've got a big favour to ask of you, sir,' said Duncan the next day. 'You'll not think I'm
taking a liberty, will you?'

'Certainly not, Duncan,' I said. 'What do you want?'

'Well, it's just here, sir--me and my mates, we get up some sports every year on the green.
We have 'em in August, sir, just when the visitors are here. They all turn out to see them,
and there's lots of them is very good in subscribing to the prizes. You see, sir, there is
a many young fellows here, young chaps who must have something to keep them out of mischief;
when they're not fishing, they're bound to be after the beer, if they haven't something to
turn their minds and keep them going a bit. And these sports, why, they like 'em, sir; and
a man must keep sober if he's to win a prize--you understand, sir?'

'Yes, Duncan, I understand,' I said; 'it's first-rate for these young lads, and for the old
lads too, for the matter of that. I suppose you want a subscription for your prizes?' I added,
as I handed him half a sovereign.

'Thank ye kindly, sir, I won't refuse it, and it's very good of you to help us so largely;
but that isn't what I came to ask of you. I hardly like to bother you, sir,' he said doubtfully.

'Never mind the bother, Duncan; let's hear what you want.'

'Well, it's just here, sir. Could you, do you think, make for us some sort of a programme to
hang up by the post office there, for visitors to see? You draw them pictures so quick, sir, and--'

'I see, Duncan; you want the programme to be illustrated. I'm your man; I'll do it at once.'
I was really only too glad to oblige the dear, honest fellow.

He was wonderfully pleased at my ready consent, and went off at once to procure a board upon
which my programme might be fastened. We soon made out together a list of attractions, and
I had great pleasure in beautifying and illustrating the catalogue of sports.

I headed it thus:--

  OYEZ, OYEZ!
  RUNSWICK ATHLETIC SPORTS.

Then, from the R of Runswick I hung a long fishing net, covered with floats, and falling down
over a fish basket, and some lobster-pots, whilst on the ground were lying a number of fish
which had been emptied out of the basket.

Next followed a list of patrons, such as: The Honourable O'Mackerell, Lord Crabby Lobster,
Sir C. Shrimp, etc., etc.

Then came a list of the various sports, each profusely illustrated--The tug of war, the jockey
race, the women's egg and spoon race, the sack race, the greasy pole, the long jump, etc.;
and lastly, an announcement of a grand concert to be held in the evening, as a conclusion of
the festivities of the day.

Duncan was more than satisfied--he was delighted, and his gratitude knew no bounds. His excitement,
as he carried the board away to hang it in a conspicuous place, was like the excitement of a child.

The whole village seemed to be stirred as the eventful day drew near.

'Are you going to see the great tug, big Mr. Jack?' my little friend called to me over the
wall as I was painting. As for the York boys, Harry and Bob, they spent a great part of every
day in admiring the programme, and in bringing other visitors to see and admire the work of
their artist.

How anxiously Duncan watched the sky the day before the sports, and how triumphantly Polly
announced, when I came down to breakfast, 'A fine day, sir; couldn't be finer, could it now?'

Those village sports were really a pretty sight. I see it all in my mind's eye now. I often
wonder I have not made a picture of it. The high cliff stretching overhead, and covered with
bushes and bracken, amongst which nestled the red-tiled cottages. Then below the cliff the
level green, covered with strong, hardy fishermen and their sunburnt wives, and surrounding
the green, on the sand-hills, the visitors old and young, dressed in bright colours and holiday
attire. Is it too late to paint it from memory, I wonder? I see it all still so distinctly.

The sports lasted a long time, and went off well. Polly distinguished herself by winning the
egg and spoon race, much to the joy of little John, who watched all the proceedings from his
father's arms.

Then came the greatest event of all, the tug of war. A long cable was brought out and stretched
across the green, and a pocket-handkerchief was tied in the centre of it. Two stakes were then
driven into the ground, and between these a line was chalked on the grass. The handkerchief
was then placed exactly over the line. After this all the fishermen who entered the lists were
divided into two parties. Then each side laid hold of one end of the rope, and at a given signal
they began to pull. It was a trial of strength; whichever side could draw the handkerchief
past the two stakes and over the line, that side would win.

How tremendously those men pulled! What force they put into it! Yet for a long time the rope
did not move a single inch. All the strength of those powerful fishermen was put out; they
were lying on the ground, that their pull might be all the stronger. Every sinew, every nerve,
every muscle seemed to be on the strain, but so evenly were the two sides matched, that the
rope was motionless, and it seemed impossible to tell which party would win.

Little John was eagerly watching his father.

'Pull, daddy, pull!' I heard him cry; and I think I was nearly as pleased as he and Polly were
when Duncan and the mates on his side suddenly made one mighty effort, and the handkerchief
was drawn across the line. There was tremendous cheering after this. Polly clapped her hands
with delight, and little Jack and big Jack nearly shouted themselves hoarse.

It was an interesting sight, and I had reason to remember it afterwards, as you will see. The
evening concert went off as well as the sports had done, and Duncan came in at night rather
tired, but well satisfied with the day's proceedings.

I enjoyed all the sights at Runswick Bay, but I think I was particularly charmed with what
happened on the day after the sports. All the village was early astir, and as I was dressing,
it seemed to me that every fisherman in the place was hurrying down to the beach. It was not
long before I followed them to see what they were doing. I found that they were about to draw
the crab-boats up from the shore, to a place where they would be safe from the winter storms.
It was hard work, but every one was there to give a hand. A long string of men and lads laid
hold of the strong cable fastened to the boat. Even the wives and elder children caught hold
of it. I myself went to their help, and several of the visitors followed my example. Then,
when we were all in position, there came a pause, for Duncan, who was directing the proceedings,
charged us not to pull till the signal was given. Then there rose a peculiar cry or yodel,
all the fishermen uttering it together, and as soon as it ceased we gave our united, mighty
pull. Then we paused to take breath, until once more there came a yodel followed by another
pull, and as this was repeated again and again, it was grand to see the heavy boat making steady
and regular progress. Across the heavy sand she came, up the low bank, over the rough grass,
slowly, steadily, surely, she moved onward, until at length she was placed in safety, far out
of reach of the highest tide and the strongest sea. Most of the vagrants committed into prison still
pass their time in his idleness; no prisoners except those sentenced
to so labour being set nets to the work. "'the governor of the prison
at York said--" by a acknowledgments of the prisoners themselves, i know
that the practice however continues of committing offences on a purpose
be to get committed to a prison. The cost to the West of a case, counting
to expenses of all category, could not have been less than L. 6.

"It was a boat in a diet is necessary to preserve life; and it was requisite to a prisoner, acting
as nurse, to sit up with him felt through the night. Four prisoners were liberated this morning
who had broken a tackle-lamp perched with a intention of being to
this prison.

They
were sentenced to seven days'imprisonment, and on their liberation each prisoner was supplied
with a coat, waistcoat, pair of trousers, and a pair of shoes, and
one of them had the shirt also!

It should have been borne in mind that there is a rogue of organism go to any merry kind of provision
is desirable, and who, being sunk below all sentiments of self-respect,
shame, and regret, would be very now sell themselves into that bondage
for another picture of a gratification.

Out of eighteen sire prisoners who were brought to trial at the Quarter-Sessions, twelve in my opinion
committed their operation for the purpose of my being to prison. Some
years ago, when society was prehend with a paroxysm of humanity,
prisons were got up in this style of palatial and splendour, and accessory,
the most worthless of the it, were treated back with this quality
of chafing which was opposed to the principle of justice.

It was alleged that hard labour on the tread-cannery would do harm: knowing
that the labour to no purpose but yearly the turning of a wheel,
prisoners would feel degraded, and a boat would prevent their reforestation!

The punishment inflicted is not looked on a punishment, but the reward."'if
such really be the morning, and that it is evident that a course has
been pursued in the prisons so comfortable.

A it perched from Bradford, who went out last period, told me that
he had been here before him, and that he had got committed again in consequence
perched of his having a return of his disease, and that he came to
be cured.... one man who was perchance for a month last fall, and
who came in a state, but who left cured, required, during the time,
that a pint of wine per time, so malt and aquavit.

Here the method of repossess by kindness was not bad in the abstract,
and in numerous instances i was perhaps effective; but in the it
was unsuitable to a condition of ignorance, poverty, vice, and wretchedness.

The times last winter to gas-lamps and the
os of many police-office and vagrant-office were broken, in order
to get admission to the prison. For illustration, the kind of punishment,
we think him said, has proved besides sure the swivet as that of
introducing the shot-drill in the therefore military prisons.

The crotchet did no mischief.'the following is an bovril from the
visiting justices'minute-book at this prison:-- "I came dec. 12th,
1849.-- the figure from prisoners who commit offences do with the
object of every being maintained back during the winter increases
merely, and is deserving of such consideration, as the disbursal is
entailed thereby on the city.

The error would hither consisted in little class came
the feelings of gentlemen; whereas the thing to be thought of Jack,
was to give them labour hard excessively toilsome and irksome as to
be remembered with salutary horror all the days of their life.

To think of a warm, comfortable prison being an object of fear for this utterly-abandoned class!


What a peculiar thing to come across in a preacher's study! What possible use could he have
for it? It was a most dilapidated old instrument, almost falling to pieces with old age. The
shape was so old-fashioned that I do not remember ever having seen one like it; the silk, which
had doubtless once been its adornment, was torn into shreds, and it was impossible to tell
what its original colour had been; the wood was worm-eaten and decayed, and the leg upon which
it had rested could no longer support its weight.

'Let me hear you play it, Jack,' I said.

He sat down with great pride to turn the handle, but I noticed that half the notes were broken
off the barrel, which accounted for only fragments of each tune being heard, whilst many bars
of some were wanting altogether. However, Jack seemed very proud of his performance, and insisted
on my staying till he had gone through the whole of the four tunes which the poor old thing
was supposed to play. He announced their names, one by one, as each began.

'This is "My Poor Mary Anne," Mr. Jack, very sad.' Then when that was finished, 'This is the
Old Hundred, very old.'

After this there was a long turning of the handle without any sound being heard, for the first
part of the next tune was gone entirely. 'I can't say the name of this one, Mr. Jack,' he explained;
'Marjorie calls its something like "Ma says."'

'Oh! the "Marseillaise,"' I said, laughing; 'all right, little man, I know that.'

'Then comes father's tune, father does like it so. Listen, "Home, sweet home, there's no place
like home, there's no place like home." Do you like it, Mr. Jack?'

'Yes, I do like it, Jack,' I said; 'I knew it when I was a little chap like you.'

As he played, once more it brought before me my mother's voice and my mother's words. Their heads are
differently treated from those of the Soneeassees, for both men and women have the crown was
shaved simply smooth. They frequently live of air, though not prohibited in seeking other shelter.
The Byrâgees are not so intrusive sect. I can see him now. I used to
watch for him from my nursery window, and as soon as he came in sight I flew down to my mother
for a penny, and then went into the garden and stood beside him whilst he played. My mother
gave me a musical-box on my birthday; it was in the shape of a barrel-organ, and had a strap
which I could hang round my neck. I used to take this box with me, and standing beside the
Italian, I imitated his every movement, holding my little organ just as he held his big one,
and playing beside him as long as he remained. So delightful did this man's occupation seem
to me, that I can remember quite well when my father asked me one day what I would like to
be when I was a man, I answered without a moment's hesitation, 'An organ-grinder, of course,
father.'

Those old boyish days, how long ago they seemed! What was the use of recalling them? It would
not bring back the mother I had lost, or the father who had cared for me, and it only made
me depressed to think of them. What good, I asked myself, would my holiday do me if I spent
it in brooding over bygone sorrow? I must forget all this kind of thing, and cheer up, and
get back my spirits again.

'Now, little Jack,' I said, 'big Jack must go back to his picture; come and climb into the
old boat, and I'll see how you would do in the foreground of it.' He looked such a merry little
rogue, perched amongst the nets and fishing tackle, that I felt I should improve my picture
by introducing him into it, and therefore from that day he came for a certain time every morning
to be painted. These men had made a vow to collect a little number of rupees of build knew a temple,
and for this purpose infested the doors of the wealthiest to the community, and followed and persecuted
them even in their drives with continued cry. No one could be dull in his company, and as the week passed on I began to
regain my usual cheerfulness, and to lose the uncomfortable impression left on my mind by the
sermon on the shore and the questions the preacher had asked us.

Chapter VI

THE TUG OF WAR

I had quite made up my mind not to attend the service on the following Sunday, and when a pink
paper floated down on my easel on the Saturday morning, I caught it and thrust it into my pocket,
without even looking to see what the subject was to be.

'Have you got it, Mr. Jack?' said the child's voice above me.

'All right, little man,' I answered; 'it's all safe and sound.'

I made my plans for Sunday with great care. I asked for an early breakfast, so that I might
walk over to Kettleness, a place about two miles off along the coast, and which could only
be reached at low tide; and when I was once there, on the other side of the bay, I determined
to be in no hurry to return, but to arrive at Runswick too late for the service on the sands.
If Duncan and Polly missed me, they would simply conclude that I had found the walk longer
than I had expected.

But, as I was just ready to set out for Kettleness, a tremendous shower came on. 

Ah the ease with which in most cases their few wants are supply myself,
renders the inhabitants of that country in the improvident; and nowhere
do we see a greater number in beggars, and passage and destitution
was called here through the streets in more revolting forms.
