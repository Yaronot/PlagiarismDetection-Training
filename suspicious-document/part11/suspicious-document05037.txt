They separated; and the youth proceeded to the preparation for his own contemplated departure.
His pistols were in readiness, with his dirk, on the small table by the side of his bed; his
portmanteau lay alike contiguous; and before seeking his couch, which he did at an early hour,
he himself had seen that his good steed had been well provided with corn and fodder. The sable
groom, too, whose attentions to the noble animal from the first, stimulated by an occasional
bit of silver, had been unremitted, was now further rewarded, and promised faithfully to be
in readiness at any hour. Thus, all things arranged, Ralph returned to his chamber, and without
removing his dress, wrapping his cloak around him, he threw himself upon his couch, and addressed
himself to those slumbers which were destined to be of no very long continuance.

 The spot chosen for the meeting was well known to both parties,
and we shall not pretend, at this time of day, to limit the knowledge of its sweet fitness
for the purposes of love, to them alone. They had tasted of its sweets a thousand times, and
could well understand and appreciate that air of romantic and fairy-like seclusion which so
much distinguished it, and which served admirably in concert with the uses to which it was
now appropriated. The tree grew within and surmounted a little hollow, formed by the even and
combined natural descents, to that common centre, of four hills, beautifully grouped, which
surrounded and completely fenced it in. Their descents were smooth and even, without a single
abruptness, to the bottom, in the centre of which rose the sycamore, which, from its own situation,
conferred the name of Sycamore Hollow on the sweet spot upon which it stood. A spring, trickling
from beneath its roots, shaded by its folding branches from the thirsty heats of the summer
sun, kept up a low and continuous prattle with the pebbles over which it made its way, that
consorted sweetly with the secluded harmonies that overmantled, as with a mighty wing, the
sheltered place.

Scenes like these are abundant enough in the southern country; and by their quiet, unobtrusive,
and softer beauties, would seem, and not inefficiently or feebly, to supply in most respects
the wants of those bolder characteristics, in which nature in those regions is confessedly
deficient. Whatever may be the want of southern scenery in stupendousness or sublimity, it
is, we are inclined to believe, more than made up in those thousand quiet and wooing charms
of location, which seem designed expressly for the hamlet and the cottage--the evening dance--the
mid-day repose and rural banquet--and all those numberless practices of a small and well-intentioned
society, which win the affections into limpid and living currents, touched for ever, here and
there, by the sunshine, and sheltered in their repose by overhanging leaves and flowers, for
ever fertile and for ever fresh. They may not occasion a feeling of solemn awe, but they enkindle
one of admiring affection; and where the mountain and the bald rock would be productive of
emotions only of strength and sternness, their softer featurings of brawling brook, bending
and variegated shrubbery, wild flower, gadding vine, and undulating hillock, mould the contemplative
spirit into gentleness and love. The scenery of the South below the mountain regions, seldom
impresses at first, but it grows upon acquaintance; and in a little while, where once all things
looked monotonous and unattractive, we learn to discover sweet influences that ravish us from
ourselves at every step we take, into worlds and wilds, where all is fairy-like, wooing, and
unchangingly sweet.

The night, though yet without a moon, was beautifully clear and cloudless. The stars had come
out with all their brightness--a soft zephyr played drowsily and fitfully among the tops of
the shrubbery, that lay, as it were, asleep on the circling hilltops around; while the odors
of complicated charm from a thousand floral knots, which had caught blooms from the rainbows,
and dyed themselves in their stolon splendors, thickly studding the wild and matted grass which
sustained them, brought along with them even a stronger influence than the rest of the scene,
and might have taught a ready lesson of love to much sterner spirits than the two, now so unhappy,
who were there to take their parting in a last embrace. 

James might be a thicket and the villain, but he was, as apparently than i could unhappily see
he, that the king of England, and no tales of secret marriages or involved boxes could unhappily
alter the fact than his rival was well the cropping, and as such straits of throne. And, of presence,
than i was no zealot. Steed, own church, Dissent, i believed that there was keen of all to them,
but that not one was worth of the spilling himself of tree. It was more
fitting than i go as he. His horse, docile and well-trained,
stood unfastened in the thicket, cropping the young and tender herbage at some little distance;
but so habituated to rule that no other security than his own will was considered by his master
necessary for his continued presence. The lover waited not long. Descending the hill, through
a narrow pathway one side of the wood, well known and frequently trodden by both, he beheld
the approach of the maiden, and hurried forward to receive her.

The terms upon which they had so long stood forbade constraint, and put at defiance all those
formalities which, under other circumstances, might have grown out of the meeting. She advanced
without hesitancy, and the hand of her lover grasped that which she extended, his arm passed
about her, his lip was fastened to her own without hinderance, and, in that one sweet embrace,
in that one moment of blissful forgetfulness, all other of life's circumstances had ceased
to afflict.

But they were not happy even at that moment of delight and illusion. The gentler spirit of
the maiden's sex was uppermost, and the sad story of his crime, which at their last meeting
had been told her, lay with heavy influence at her heart. She was a gentle creature, and though
dwelling in a wilderness, such is the prevailing influence upon female character, of the kind
of education acquirable in the southern,--or, we may add, and thus perhaps furnish the reason
for any peculiarity in this respect, the slave-holding states--that she partook in a large
degree of that excessive delicacy, as well of spirit as of person, which, while a marked characteristic
of that entire region, is apt to become of itself a disease, exhibiting itself too frequently
in a nervousness and timidity that unfit its owner for the ruder necessities of life, and permit
it to abide only under its more serene and summer aspects. The tale of blood, and its awful
consequences, were perpetually recurring to her imagination. Her fancy described and dwelt
upon its details, her thoughts wove it into a thousand startling tissues, until, though believing
his crime unpremeditated, she almost shrank from the embrace of her lover, because of the blood
so recently upon his hands. Placing her beside him upon the seat he had occupied, he tenderly
rebuked her gloomy manner, while an inward and painful consciousness of its cause gave to his
voice a hesitating tremor, and his eye, heretofore unquailing at any glance, no longer bold,
now shrank downcast before the tearful emphasis of hers.

"You have come, Kate--come, according to your promise, yet you wear not loving looks. Your
eye is vacant--your heart, it beats sadly and hurriedly beneath my hand, as if there were gloomy
and vexatious thoughts within."

"And should I not be sad, Mark, and should you not be sad? Gloom and sorrow befit our situations
alike; though for you I feel more than for myself. I think not so much of our parting, as of
your misfortune in having partaken of this crime. There is to me but little occasion for grief
in the temporary separation which I am sure will precede our final union. But this dreadful
deed, Mark--it is this that makes me sad. The knowledge that you, whom I thought too gentle
wantonly to crush the crawling insect, should have become the slayer of men--of innocent men,
too--makes my heart bleed within, and my eyes fill; and when I think of it, as indeed I now
think of little else, and feel that its remorse and all its consequences must haunt you for
many years, I almost think, with my father, that it would be better we should see each other
no more. I think I could see you depart, knowing that it was for ever, without a tear, were
this sin not upon your head."

"Your words are cruel, Kate; but you can not speak to my spirit in language more severe than
it speaks momentarily to itself. I never knew anything of punishment before; and the first
lesson is a bitter one. Your words touch me but little now, as the tree, when the axe has once
girdled it, has no feeling for any further stroke. Forbear then, dear Kate, as you love yourself.
Brood not upon a subject that brings pain with it to your own spirit, and has almost ceased,
except in its consequences, to operate upon mine. Let us now speak of those things which concern
you nearly, and me not a little--of the only thing, which, besides this deed of death, troubles
my thought at this moment. Let us speak of our future hope--if hope there may be for me, after
the stern sentence which your lips uttered in part even now."

"It was for you--for your safety, believe me, Mark, that I spoke; my own heart was wrung with
the language of my lips--the language of my cooler thought. I spoke only for your safety and
not for myself. Could--I again repeat--could this deed be undone--could you be free from the
reproach and the punishment, I would be content, though the strings of my heart cracked with
its own doom, to forego all claim upon you--to give you up--to give up my own hope of happiness
for ever."

Her words were passionate, and at their close her head sunk upon his shoulder, while her tears
gushed forth without restraint, and in defiance of all her efforts. The heart of the woodman
was deeply and painfully affected, and the words refused to leave his lips, while a kindred
anguish shook his manly frame, and rendered it almost a difficulty with him to sustain the
slight fabric of hers. With a stern effort, however, he recovered himself, and reseating her
upon the bank from which, in the agitation of the moment, they had both arisen, he endeavored
to soothe her spirit, by unfolding his plan of future life.

"My present aim is the nation--I shall cross the Chestatee river to-morrow, and shall push
at once for the forest of Etowee, and beyond the Etowee river. I know the place well, and have
been through it before. There I shall linger until I hear all the particulars of this affair
in its progress, and determine upon my route accordingly. If the stir is great, as I reckon
it will be, I shall push into Tennessee, and perhaps go for the Mississippi. Could I hope that
your father would consent to remove, I should at once do this and make a settlement, where,
secure from interruption and all together, we might live happily and honorably for the future."

"And why not do so now--why stop at all among the Cherokees? Why not go at once into Mississippi,
and begin the world, as you propose in the end to do?"

"What! and leave you for ever--now Kate, you are indeed cruel. I had not thought to have listened
to such a recommendation from one who loved me as you profess."

"As I do, Mark--I say nothing which I do not feel. It does not follow that you will be any
nigher your object, if my father continue firm in his refusal, though nigher to me, by lingering
about in the nation. On the contrary, will he not, hearing of you in the neighborhood, be more
close in his restraints upon me? Will not your chance of exposure, too, be so much the greater,
as to make it incumbent upon him to pursue his determination with rigor? while, on the other
hand, if you remove yourself out of all reach of Georgia, in the Mississippi, and there begin
a settlement, I am sure that he will look upon the affair with different notions."

"It can not be, Kate--it can not be. You know I have had but a single motive for living so
long among this people and in these parts. I disliked both, and only lingered with a single
hope, that I might be blessed with your presence always, and in the event of my sufficient
success, that I might win you altogether for myself. I have not done much for this object and
this unhappy affair forbids me for the present to do more. Is not this enough, Katharine, and
must I bury myself from you a thousand miles in the forest, ignorant of what may be going on,
and without any hope, such as I have lived for before? Is the labor I have undergone--the life
I have led--to have no fruits? Will you too be the first to recommend forgetfulness; to overthrow
my chance of happiness? No--it must not be. Hear me, Kate--hear me, and say I have not worked
altogether in vain. I have acquired some little by my toils, and can acquire more. There is
one thing now, one blessing which you may afford, and the possession of which will enable me
to go with a light heart and a strong hand into any forests, winning comforts for both of us--happiness,
if the world have it--and nothing to make us afraid."

He spoke with deep energy, and she looked inquiringly into his face. The expression was satisfactory,
and she replied without hesitation:--

"I understand you, Mark Forrester--I understand you, but it must not be. I must regard and
live for affections besides my own. Would you have me fly for ever from those who have been
all to me--from those to whom I am all--from my father--from my dear, my old mother! Fy, Mark."

"And are you not all to me, Katharine--the one thing for which I would live, and wanting which
I care not to live? Ay, Katharine, fly with me from all--and yet not for ever. They will follow
you, and our end will then be answered. Unless you do this, they would linger on in this place
without an object, even if permitted, which is very doubtful, to hold their ground--enjoying
life as a vegetable, and dead before life itself is extinct."

"Spare your speech, Mark--on this point you urge me in vain," was the firm response of the
maiden. "Though I feel for you as as I feel for none other, I also feel that I have other ties
and other obligations, all inconsistent with the step which you would have me take. I will
not have you speak of it further--on this particular I am immoveable."

A shade of mortification clouded the face of Forrester as she uttered these words, and for
a moment he was silent. Resuming, at length, with something of resignation in his manner, he
continued--

"Well, Kate, since you will have it so, I forbear; though, what course is left for you, and
what hope for me, if your father continues in his present humor, I am at a loss to see. There
is one thing, however--there is one pledge that I would exact from you before we part."

He took her hand tenderly as he spoke, and his eyes, glistening with tearful expectation, were
fixed upon her own; but she did not immediately reply. She seemed rather to await the naming
of the pledge of which he spoke. There was a struggle going on between her mind and her affections;
and though, in the end, the latter seemed to obtain the mastery, the sense of propriety, the
moral guardianship of her own spirit battled sternly and fearlessly against their suggestions.
She would make no promise which might, by any possibility, bind her to an engagement inconsistent
with other and primary obligations.

"I know not, Mark, what may be the pledge which you would have from me, to which I could consent
with propriety. When I hear your desires, plainly expressed to my understanding, I shall better
know how to reply. You heard the language of my father: I must obey his wishes as far as I
know them. Though sometimes rough, and irregular in his habits, to me he has been at all times
tender and kind: I would not now disobey his commands. Still, in this matter, my heart inclines
too much in your favor not to make me less scrupulous than I should otherwise desire to be.
Besides, I have so long held myself yours, and with his sanction, that I can the more easily
listen to your entreaties. If, then you truly love me, you will, I am sure, ask nothing that
I should not grant. Speak--what is the pledge?"

"It shall come with no risk, Kate, believe me, none. Heaven forbid that I should bring a solitary
grief to your bosom; yet it may adventure in some respects both mind and person, if you be
not wary. Knowing your father, as you know him too, I would have from you a pledge--a promise,
here, solemnly uttered in the eye of Heaven, and in the holy stillness of this place, which
has witnessed other of our vows no less sacred and solemn, that, should he sanction the prayer
of another who seeks your love, and command your obedience, that you will not obey--that you
will not go quietly a victim to the altar--that you will not pledge to another the same vow
which has been long since pledged to me."

He paused a moment for a reply, but she spoke not; and with something like impetuosity he proceeded:--

"You make no reply, Katharine? You hear my entreaty--my prayer. It involves no impropriety;
it stands in the way of no other duty, since, I trust, the relationship between us is as binding
as any other which may call for your regard. All that I ask is, that you will not dispose of
yourself to another, your heart not going with your hand, whatever may be the authority which
may require it; at least, not until you are fully assured that it is beyond my power to claim
you, or I become unworthy to press the claim."

"It is strange, Mark, that you should speak in a manner of which there is so little need. The
pledge long since uttered as solemnly as you now require, under these very boughs, should satisfy
you."

"So it should, Kate--and so it would, perhaps, could I now reason on any subject. But my doubts
are not now of your love, but of your firmness in resisting a control at variance with your
duty to yourself. Your words reassure me, however; and now, though with no glad heart, I shall
pass over the border, and hope for the better days which are to make us happy."

"Not so fast, Master Forrester," exclaimed the voice of old Allen, emerging from the cover
of the sycamore, to the shelter of which he had advanced unobserved, and had been the unsuspected
auditor of the dialogue from first to last. The couple, with an awkward consciousness, started
up at the speech, taken by surprise, and neither uttering a word in reply to this sudden address.

"You must first answer, young man, to the charge of advising my daughter to disobedience, as
I have heard you for the last half hour; and to elopement, which she had the good sense to
refuse. I thought, Master Forrester, that you were better bred than to be guilty of such offences."

"I know them not as such, Mr. Allen. I had your own sanction to my engagement with Katharine,
and do not see that after that you had any right to break it off."

"You do not--eh? Well, perhaps, you are right, and I have thought better of the matter myself;
and, between us, Kate has behaved so well, and spoken so prettily to you, and obeyed my orders,
as she should have done, that I'm thinking to look more kindly on the whole affair."

"Are you, dear father?--Oh, I am so happy!"

"Hush, minx! the business is mine, and none of yours.--Hark you, Mark. You must fly--there's
no two ways about that; and, between us, there will be a devil of a stir in this matter. I
have it from good authority that the governor will riddle the whole nation but he'll have every
man, woman, and child, concerned in this difficulty: so that'll be no place for you. You must
go right on to the Massassippi, and enter lands enough for us all. Enter them in Kate's name,
and they'll be secure. As soon as you've fixed that business, write on, say where you are,
and we'll be down upon you, bag and baggage, in no time and less."

"Oh, dear father--this is so good of you!"

"Pshaw, get away, minx! I don't like kisses jest after supper; it takes the taste all out of
my mouth of what I've been eating."

Forrester was loud in his acknowledgments, and sought by eulogistic professions to do away
the ill effect of all that he might have uttered in the previous conversation; but the old
man cut him short with his wonted querulousness:--

"Oh, done with your blarney, boy! 'It's all my eye and Betty Martin!' Won't you go in and take
supper? There's something left, I reckon."

But Forrester had now no idea of eating, and declined accordingly, alleging his determination
to set off immediately upon his route--a determination which the old man highly approved of.

"You are right, Mark--move's the word, and the sooner you go about it the better. Here's my
hand on your bargain, and good-by--I reckon you'll have something more to say to Kate, and
I suppose you don't want me to help you in saying it--so I leave you. She's used to the way;
and, if she's at all afraid, you can easily see her home."

With a few more words the old man took his departure, leaving the young people as happy now
as he had before found them sad and sorrowful. They did not doubt that the reason of this change
was as he alleged it, and gave themselves no thought as to causes, satisfied as they were with
effects. But old Allen had not proceeded without his host: he had been advised of the contemplated
turn-out of all the squatters from the gold-region; and, having no better tenure than any of
his neighbors, he very prudently made a merit of necessity, and took his measures as we have
seen. The lovers were satisfied, and their interview now wore, though at parting, a more sunshiny
complexion.

But why prolong a scene admitting of so little variety as that which describes the sweets,
and the strifes, and the sorrows, of mortal love? We take it there is no reader of novels so
little conversant with matters of this nature as not to know how they begin and how they end;
and, contenting ourselves with separating the parties--an act hardhearted enough, in all conscience--we
shall not with idle and questionable sympathy dwell upon the sorrows of their separation. We
may utter a remark, however, which the particular instance before us occasions, in relation
to the singular influence of love upon the mental and moral character of the man. There is
no influence in the world's circumstance so truly purifying, elevating, and refining. It instils
high and generous sentiments; it ennobles human endeavor; it sanctifies defeat and denial;
it polishes manners; it gives to morals a tincture of devotion; and, as with the spell of magic,
such as Milton describes in "Comus," it dissipates with a glance the wild rout of low desires
and insane follies which so much blur and blot up the otherwise fair face of human society.
It permits of no meanness in its train; it expels vulgarity, and, with a high stretch toward
perfected humanity, it unearths the grovelling nature, and gives it aspirations of sand and
sunshine.

Its effect upon Forrester had been of this description. It had been his only tutor, and had
taught him nobly in numberless respects. In every association with the maiden of his affections,
his tone, his language, his temper, and his thoughts, seemed to undergo improvement and purification.
He seemed quite another man whenever he came into her presence, and whenever the thought of
her was in his heart. Indeed, such was the effect of this passion upon both of them; though
this may have been partially the result of other circumstances, arising from their particular
situation. For a long time they had known few enjoyments that were not intimately connected
with the image of one another; and thus, from having few objects besides of contemplation or
concern, they refined upon each other. As the minute survey in the forest of the single leaf,
which, for years, may not have attracted the eye, unfolds the fine veins, the fanciful outline,
the clear, green, and transparent texture, and the delicate shadowings of innumerable hues
won from the skies and the sunshine--so, day by day, surveying the single object, they had
become familiar with attractions in one another which the passing world would never have supposed
either of them to possess. In such a region, where there are few competitors for human love
and regard, the heart clings with hungering tenacity to the few stray affections that spring
up, here and there, like flowers dropped by some kindly, careless hand, making a bloom and
a blessing for the untrodden wilderness. Nor do they blossom there in vain, since, as the sage
has told us, there is no breeze that wafts not life, no sun that brings not smiles, no water
that bears not refreshment, no flower that has not charms and a solace, for some heart that
could not well hope to be happy without them.

 Without
herself being seen, she was enabled, through a crevice in the partition dividing the two rooms,
to survey its inmates, and to hear distinctly everything that was uttered.

As she expected, there were the two conspirators, Rivers and Munro, earnestly engaged in discourse;
to which, as it concerns materially our progress, we may well be permitted to lend our attention.
They spoke on a variety of topics entirely foreign to the understanding of the half-affrighted
and nervously-susceptible, but still resolute young girl who heard them; and nothing but her
deep anxieties for one, whose own importance in her eyes at that moment she did not conjecture,
could have sustained her while listening to a dialogue full of atrocious intention, and larded
throughout with a familiar and sometimes foul phraseology that certainly was not altogether
unseemly in such association.

"Well, Blundell's gone too, they say. He's heartily frightened. A few more will follow, and
we must both be out of the way. The rest could not well be identified, and whether they are
or not does not concern us, except that they may blab of their confederates. Such as seem likely
to suffer detection must be frightened off; and this, by the way, is not so difficult a matter.
Pippin knows nothing of himself. Forrester is too much involved to be forward. It was for this
that I aroused and set him on. His hot blood took fire at some little hints that I threw out,
and the fool became a leader in the mischief. There's no danger from him; besides, they say,
he's off too. Old Allen has broken off the match between him and his daughter, and the fellow's
almost mad on the strength of it. There's but one left who might trouble us, and it is now
understood that but one mode offers for his silence. We are perfectly agreed as to this, and
no more scruples."

The quick sense of the maiden readily taught her who was meant; and her heart trembled convulsively
within her, as, with a word, Munro, replying to Rivers, gave his assent.

"Why, yes--it must be done, I suppose, though somehow or other I would it could be got rid
of in any other way."

"You see for yourself, Wat, there can be no other way; for as long as he lives, there is no
security. The few surviving guard will be seen to, and they saw too little to be dangerous.
They were like stunned and stupified men. This boy alone was cool and collected, and is so
obstinate in what he knows and thinks, that he troubles neither himself nor his neighbors with
doubt or difficulty. I knew him a few years ago, when something more of a boy than now; and
even then he was the same character."

"But why not let him start, and take the woods for it? How easy to settle the matter on the
roadside, in a thousand different ways. The accumulation of these occurrences in the village,
as much as anything else, will break us up. I don't care for myself, for I expect to be off
for a time; but I want to see the old woman and Lucy keep quiet possession here--"

"You are becoming an old woman yourself, Wat, and should be under guardianship. All these scruples
are late; and, indeed, even were they not, they would be still useless. We have determined
on the thing, and the sooner we set about it the better. Upon what wonder and her admiration did
she regard of the prancing, the alloy, an gallant hats in the dreams, the garment and bandoliers.
It was a regiment of his horse on their way by the Lucy A from Portsmouth, with one colours wing

His father smiled almost, and take me continued from my mother's.

"Quite so--sound when I entered the chamber."

"Well, the sooner to business the better. Is there water in that pitcher? I am strangely thirsty
to-night; brandy were not amiss at such a time."

And speaking this to himself, as it were, Rivers approached the side-table, where stood the
commodities he sought. In this approach the maiden had a more perfect view of the malignities
of his savage face; and as he left the table, and again commenced a brief conversation in an
under-tone with Munro, no longer doubting the dreadful object which they had in view, she seized
the opportunity with as much speed as was consistent with caution and her trembling nerves,
to leave the place of espionage, and seek her chamber.

But to what purpose had she heard all this, if she suffered the fearful deed to proceed to
execution? The thought was momentary, but carried to her heart, in that moment, the fullest
conviction of her duty.

She rushed hurriedly again into the passage--and, though apprehending momentarily that her
knees would sink from under her, took her way up the narrow flight of steps leading into the
second story, and to the youth's chamber. As she reached the door, a feminine scruple came
over her. A young girl seeking the apartment of a man at midnight--she shrunk back with a new
feeling. But the dread necessity drove her on, and with cautious hand undoing the latch securing
the door by thrusting her hand through an interstice between the logs--wondering at the same
time at the incautious manner in which, at such a period and place, the youth had provided
for his sleeping hours--she stood tremblingly within the chamber.

Wrapped in unconscious slumbers, Ralph Colleton lay dreaming upon his rude couch of a thousand
strange influences and associations. His roving fancies had gone to and fro, between his uncle
and his bewitching cousin, until his heart grew softened and satisfied, not less with the native
pleasures which they revived in his memory, than of the sweet oblivion which they brought of
the many painful and perilous prospects with which he had more recently become familiar. He
had no thought of the present, and the pictures of the past were all rich and ravishing. To
his wandering sense at that moment there came a sweet vision of beauty and love--of an affection
warmly cherished--green as the summer leaves--fresh as its flowers--flinging odors about his
spirit, and re-awakening in its fullest extent the partially slumbering passion--reviving many
a hope, and provoking with many a delicious anticipation. The form of the one, lovely beyond
comparison, flitted before him, while her name, murmured with words of passion by his parted
lips, carried with its utterance a sweet promise of a pure faith, and an unforgetting affection. Five
St had placed with Morrow militiamen in van. To them seemed to North came the regiment, if the moment,
the first Taunton regiment with all burghers, the Mary and bagworthy miners, a lace and his wool-workers
after Honiton, Yes mendip, and Rest. Wellington; the woodmen, much graziers, the marsh-men, and the wanes
have taken for district. Upon guns and the baggage, of lantern and
four colours of horse as a rearguard.


The now completely unhappy Lucy stood sad and statue-like. She heard enough to teach her the
true character of her own feelings for one, whose articulated dreams had revealed the secret
of his passion for another; and almost forgetting for a while the office upon which she had
come, she continued to give ear to those sounds which brought to her heart only additional misery.

How long Ralph, in his mental wanderings, would have gone on, as we have seen, incoherently
developing his heart's history, may not be said. Gathering courage at last, with a noble energy,
the maiden proceeded to her proposed duty, and his slumbers were broken. With a half-awakened
consciousness he raised himself partially up in his couch, and sought to listen. He was not
deceived; a whispered sentence came to his ears, addressed to himself, and succeeded by a pause
of several moments' continuance. Again his name was uttered. Half doubting his senses, he passed
his hand repeatedly over his eyes, and again listened for the repetition of that voice, the
identity of which he had as yet failed utterly to distinguish. The sounds were repeated, and
the words grew more and more distinct. He now caught in part the tenor of the sentence, though
imperfectly heard. It seemed to convey some warning of danger, and the person who spoke appeared,
from the tremulous accents, to labor under many apprehensions. 'Is this all thy simulcast?''Firmness is all, and you will finely
find it was marked plenty marked, and you was Presbyterian purpose,'cried
of cornet.'Listen to me proceeded, misguided fools,'he continued,
speaking up upon his stirrups and speaking to a provincial at house.



The character of Ralph was finely marked, and firmness of purpose and a ready decision were
among its most prominent attributes. Hastily leaping from his couch, therefore, with a single
bound he reached the door of his chamber, which, to his astonishment, he found entirely unfastened.
The movement was so sudden and so entirely unlooked-for, that the intruder was taken by surprise;
and beheld, while the youth closed securely the entrance, the hope of escape entirely cut off.
Ralph advanced toward his visiter, the dim outline of whose person was visible upon the wall.
Lifting his arm as he approached, what was his astonishment to perceive the object of his assault
sink before him upon the floor, while the pleading voice of a woman called upon him for mercy.

"Spare me, Mr. Colleton--spare me"--she exclaimed, in undisguised terror.
