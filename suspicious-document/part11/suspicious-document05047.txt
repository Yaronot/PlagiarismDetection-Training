"Has he got one of his bad spells?" she demanded.  "And that child in his room.  Well, fools
rush--"

"She's playing he's her little boy," explained Mary, making the most of the sensation of being
an actor in a real drama.  "She fed him his soup and slopped him, but he took me up sharp when
I tried to stop her.  He acts as if she's got him clean bewitched."

"Well!" exclaimed Mrs. West, as Persis looked at her dumbly.  "I never expected to live to
see that Scripture fulfilled.  The wolf and lamb lying down together and a weaned child in
a cockatrice's den."

"Are you sure he wasn't angry?" asked Persis, still a little pale and doubtful.

Mary bridled.

"Go and see for yourself, Miss Dale, if you don't believe me.  When I tried to stop her eating
a good half of that broth, and chicken as high as 'tis, he the same as called me a fool for
meddling. The suspicion who wrote groundless; but the Element-large put abroad, that

CHAPTER XVII

ENID

If Persis Dale's extraordinary action in adopting a family en masse had stirred Clematis from
center to circumference, that agitation was trivial in comparison with the flutter produced
by Joel's capitulation. Mrs. West, backed up by Mary, told the news to auditors frankly incredulous
who yet were sufficiently impressed by her sincerity to resolve on looking into the thing for
themselves.  Consequently the Dale homestead became a magnet for the curious, and many a skeptic
came and went away convinced that the day of miracles had returned.

As a matter of fact Joel's surrender was in accord with the most elemental of psychological
laws.  With the characteristic caprice of her sex in matters of the heart, Celia had taken
a violent fancy to this pale-blooded hypochondriac, and made no secret of the fact that she
regarded him as her especial property.  Nothing is so flattering to the vanity as the preference
of a child, that naive, spontaneous affection to which it is impossible to impute mercenary
motives.  And Joel had responded by becoming Celia's abject slave.  He ignored the other children
for the most part, seldom betraying, unless perhaps by an impatient gesture or a frown, that
he was aware of their existence. But his eyes were always on Celia, and when she spoke, he
listened.

As was to be expected, that morsel of femininity improved every opportunity to parade her conquest.
She took Joel to walk, holding tightly to his hand and entertaining him with an outpouring
of those quaint fancies which have been the heritage of childhood from the beginning and yet
always seem to the older generation so marvelously new.  She inveigled him into playing whatever
rôle she assigned in fantastic dramas of her own creation.  He was Celia's father or her little
boy as the whim took her, the wolf which devoured Red Riding Hood's grandmother, or the hapless
old lady herself, attacked ruthlessly by Celia as wolf.  Crawling on all fours he played elephant,
or with the handle of a basket between his teeth, he submitted to be patted on the head and
addressed as Towser.  Persis looked on with a wonder that never lost its poignancy.  That the
self-centered Joel should succumb to the innocent spell of childhood had never entered her
calculations, and she reproached herself that she had so little understood him.

The comments of Persis' acquaintances were characteristic.  Mrs. West, on the occasion of a
second call, hinted her anxiety regarding the future of the impromptu family.  "When you pick
children up that way, you can't tell how they're going to turn out."

"And when you bring 'em into the world," remarked Persis dryly, "and rear 'em yourself and
never let 'em out of your sight when you can help it, you don't know how they're going to turn
out either."  There was in her manner an ingenious suggestion of having in mind the recent
heart-broken confidences of Thad's mother, and Etta West blushed hotly and changed the subject.

Mrs. Robert Hornblower looked upon the acquisition as practical rebellion against the decrees
of Providence.  In Persis' presence, she said little, having a sincere respect for her ex-dressmaker's
gift of repartee.  But to Mr. Hornblower, she expressed herself in no uncertain terms.

"If it's the Lord's will for a woman to raise a family, it stands to reason He'll send her
a husband.  This snapping your fingers in the face of the Almighty and gathering up children
from here and there and anywhere, looks downright impious."

"Seems to me," began Mr. Hornblower in mild expostulation, "that Persis Dale--"

"Yes, I know, Robert," interrupted the submissive wife.  "I feel just as you do.  It's always
been Persis Dale's greatest fault to imagine that she's a law unto herself.  But this time
she's overstepped the mark."

"Those children are orphans," exclaimed Mr. Hornblower, his complexion becoming apoplectic.
"And if--"

Ordinarily Diantha would have fluttered at the compliment.  In her present preoccupation, it
drew from her only a thoughtful smile.

"She's going to sleep," she said, an exquisite softness in her voice. "How nice and heavy their
heads feel when they're sleepy, Miss Persis!"

"Well?"

"I'm going to adopt a lot of children some day.  I always was crazy to have a crowd around.
The way I've prayed for a sister," sighed Diantha, her face temporarily overcast.  And then
brightening: "When I get old enough to do as I please, I'll make up for it."

Persis, studying the rapt young face, made no immediate reply.  Her sense of guilty complicity
in Diantha's precocious womanhood distracted her attention from the girl's resentful speech.
Apparently her silence proved stimulating to Diantha's impulse toward confidences.

"Do you know the latest notion mother's got in her head?"

"No."

"She wants to send me off to school somewhere.  She talks to father and talks to him, till
I'm afraid she'll tire him into it.  Thad West says any woman can get her way if she never
stops talking about it."

Persis regarded her keenly and Diantha's color rose.  For no apparent reason her blush became
a conflagration.

"I didn't know you and Thad had much chance to talk things over nowadays."

"They won't let him come to the house.  They say I'm too young." Diantha laughed mockingly.
"And mother was only a little older when she married father, and she was engaged twice before
that."

"I suppose you keep on seeing him just the same."

"Course I do."

Persis mused.  Diantha was wrong, undoubtedly, and yet more sinned against than sinning.  Cautions
and expostulations were unavailing with this spirited young creature, smarting under continued
injustice and seeing with her uncompromising clearness of vision the selfish jealousy which
would keep her out of her birthright indefinitely.  "You want to be real careful, Diantha,"
said Persis, realizing the futility of her words.  "Thad's a nice boy and you're a nice girl,
but it don't look well for young folks to be meeting on the sly."

She tried but with little success, to exercise a certain supervision over Diantha that winter.
Though the children came down with measles one after another, and Joel had an attack of rheumatism
which kept him a prisoner in his bed for seven weeks, it seemed to Persis that Diantha was
never really out of her mind.  She was surprised on the other hand to find how little Justin
Ware was in her thoughts.  Instead of returning to Clematis in a few weeks as he had intended,
he had been called West unexpectedly.  He had not written Persis to apprise her of his change
of plans, and she heard of it only through Mrs. Hornblower. And the astonishing part was that
she heard it with scarcely a pang. She had discontinued her practise of saying good night to
the photograph in the plush frame with Justin Ware's return, but sometimes when the house was
still, she took her stand before it and studied the pleasant, immature face intently, as if
trying to read from its ingenuous smile a solution of some inward perplexity.

The measles and the winter ran their course together.  The children ventured out and the daffodils
ventured up.  Joel hobbled about with a cane and took Celia in search of violets.  The baby
who had come very near dying, decided apparently that since recovery was in order she might
as well make a thorough job of it and began to grow fat and sweet-tempered and to acquire dimples.
And Persis made the pleasing discovery that in the months during which she had been a woman
of property, she had not spent her income and resolved at once on rectifying this needless
opulence.

"I've done considerable plodding in my time, I wouldn't mind a little skimming for a change,"
thought Persis.  Next to a family she had long craved an automobile.  The surplus of her income
was sufficient for the purchase of one of the cheaper grades of cars.  Persis decided on a
visit to the city, with a view to making this investment.

"I'm a little seedy with being shut in so much this winter, and a trip will do me good whether
I buy an automobile or not.  Mary's mother will come and stay with her and help out with the
children.  And if Joel wants to go along, he can."  But apparently the protective impulse which
had moved Joel to offer his company on the occasion of her previous visit had waned during
the winter.  He declined the invitation without thanks.

It was proof enough of Persis' temperamental youthfulness that she reached the city with as
keen a sense of adventure as if she had been a runaway boy following a circus.  She went to
the modest hotel she had patronized the previous fall and was surprised and flattered when
the clerk called her by name.

"Gives a body a home-coming feeling, that does," remarked Persis, as she wrote the cramped
signature which so poorly represented her robust personality.  "I don't see how you can remember
everybody, with folks coming and going all the time."

"There are some people it's easy to remember," replied the clerk gallantly and at the same
time with sincerity.  Whatever else time erased from the tablets of his memory, he would never
forget Persis, and her acquisition of a family.  Then he looked at her interrogatively, for
Persis had jumped, blotting the register.

"You'll have to excuse me."  Persis reached for the blotter.  "I saw a name I know and it sort
of took my breath."  There were but two signatures on the page besides her own, the names of
Mrs. Honoria Walsh and Enid Randolph, both of Warren, New York.

"I'll give you room forty-two," said the clerk, taking a key from the hook and nodding to a
watchful lad in uniform.  "Mrs. Walsh and her niece Miss Randolph are on the same floor.  If
they are friends of yours--"

"No, I wouldn't say that," Persis interrupted. 'have the commonweal, item eugène algonquian,

  At
least that was the way with the one you wrote Mr. Wash--"

For the second time Miss Randolph looked toward the door, and when next Persis saw her eyes
they were appealing rather than disdainful.

"The letter by mistake was sent to a young man who lives in Clematis," Persis continued.  "His
name is Thompson, and W. Thompson, at that.  He thought it such a joke that he put it in his
pocket for his wife to find.  Didn't know 'twas loaded, you see.  And when she did find it
and he explained, she didn't believe him.  I don't know as anybody believed him but me, but
it seemed such a silly explanation for a sensible man to make up that I felt pretty sure it
must be true."

Miss Randolph put down her pen and gave herself up to the business of listening.

"If I could tell you how that little woman looked," declared Persis, "it would just make your
heart jump to think it was you that helped her.  Only six months married, she was, too.  Well,
I took a risk and wrote to Mr. Thompson, Cleveland, and when I got his letter I knew everything
was all right.  But I wasn't sure of proving it to young Mrs. Thompson.  After a woman's brooded
over a thing as long as she had, with her neighbors egging her on to do something desperate,
she's not going to be convinced with anything short of downright proof.  But between your letter
and Mr. Wash--"

"I don't see," interrupted Miss Randolph quickly, "that she has anything to thank me for. 
You certainly deserve all the credit, Miss Dale, for clearing up the mystery."

"Well, they were grateful all right," Persis smiled reminiscently. "The baby's six weeks old
now, and her name is Persis Dale Thompson. And they're both about as happy as any folks you're
likely to see till you die and go to Heaven.  But I couldn't have done anything without your
help, and I wish I thought you was half as contented as I know they are."

"Really," said Miss Randolph, with an unsuccessful attempt to duplicate her earlier reserve,
"it is impossible for me to see--"

"Yes, I know."  Persis leaned toward her, speaking with a vehemence that swept the feeble expostulation
aside.  "But just because I never set eyes on you before ain't any reason why I shouldn't want
you to be happy.  I've laid awake nights thinking about that letter of yours, so loving and
so sorrowful.  Dearie, if love pulls you one way and conscience the other, there's only one
thing to do and that's the right thing."

"Really," began Miss Randolph, and then her eyes unexpectedly filled, quenching the incipient
fire of her indignation.  She had recourse to her handkerchief and Persis patted her shoulder,
and in that instant the two were friends.

"You don't quite understand," explained Enid in a muffled voice. "'Tommy' isn't married.  'Her'
is auntie."

Persis drew a sigh of such unmistakable relief that the girl looked at her amazed.  The older
woman's face was shining.

"Well, that's a weight off my mind," she smiled.  "Nothing but your aunt.  Thank goodness."

"A weight off your mind!" Enid repeated.  "But you didn't know me."

"No, but I knew you were a young thing in trouble, and that 'Her' gave me many a bad minute."

Enid's fingers reached gropingly toward her new-found friend.  Their two hands clasped and
held fast.

"Auntie took me when I was a little girl.  I was an orphan.  She's been everything to me, and
she adores me.  But she doesn't like Tommy."

"Why not?"

"She hasn't anything really against him except that he's poor.  It would kill her to have me
leave her to marry him.  I can't bring myself to do it.  And yet I can't bring myself to give
Tommy up."  She was crying in earnest now, and the clasp of Persis' hand tightened.

"You can't and you oughtn't.  There's too much sacrifice of love these days.  Young fellows
instead of having homes of their own are supporting two or three grown-up sisters and getting
crabbed and bitter.  And girls the Lord meant for wives and mothers stay at home because the
old folks don't want to spare them.  Nine times out of ten it's like Abraham sacrificing Isaac,
and there's a he-goat somewhere round in the bushes that would do just as well."

"But it would seem so dreadfully ungrateful to disappoint her," gasped Enid Randolph with the
air of one who longs to be disproved.  "After she's done everything for me."

"Bless you, child, if you love and are sure of him, the mother who bore you wouldn't have a
right to say no.  And what's more, if you're sensible enough to go your own way, she'll probably
end up by thinking he next thing to made the world and taking all the credit for the match.
You're twenty-one, of course."

"Twenty-three."

"Then I wouldn't have any more of this underhanded business.  Talk it out with your aunt, and
unless she can show you good reasons for giving up your young man, you've got the best reason
in the world for taking him."

Enid deliberated.  Then very slowly she tore her letter to bits.

"I was saying good-by to him forever--for the twenty-ninth time."  She smiled somewhat palely.
"But I rather think, Miss Persis Dale, that I'll take your advice."

CHAPTER XVIII

A STALLED ENGINE

"Well, I don't expect to be any nearer flying till I get to Heaven and they fit me to a pair
of wings.  I might try a little jaunt in an air-ship some day, but I don't feel as if I'd relish
that for a steady diet.  For this world, an automobile is plenty good enough for me."

Not for many a year had Persis been possessed by such a sense of buoyancy and youthfulness.
The road lay straight and smooth before her.  The little car, obedient to her strong capable
hand, spun along the shining track, counterfeiting by the swiftness of its motion the breeze
lacking in the languid spring day.  Persis had laid aside her hat, and the rush of air ruffled
her abundant hair and rouged her cheeks.  As a matter of fact, Persis was not so near flying
as she thought.  In the most conservative community, there would have been little danger of
her arrest for exceeding the speed limit.  But to one accustomed to the sedate jog-trot of
farm horses taken from the plow to hitch to the capacious carry-all, the ten-mile-an-hour gait
of the new motor seemed exhilarating flight.

The day had the deceptive stillness by which nature disguises the ferocious intensity of her
spring-time activities.  Bird, beast and insensate clod all felt the challenge of the season.
Persis had responded characteristically by cleaning house from six o'clock till noon and making
a dress for Betty in the interval which less strenuous natures devote to afternoon naps.  And
now that Celia was off somewhere with Joel, and Betty had promised to look after the baby,
and the boys had received permission to inspect a family of puppies newly arrived in the neighborhood,
Persis was scurrying hither and thither with all the ebullient light-heartedness of a girl
let out of school.  She had startled the staid residents of Twin Rivers, where the spectacle
of a woman driving a car ranked in interest second only to a circus parade. She had frightened
two horses and narrowly escaped running over a chicken.  And now she turned her face homeward,
with the deliberate intention of ignoring the approach of supper-time and inviting young Mrs.
Thompson to take the baby out for an airing.  At no other time of the year would Persis have
considered being late to supper for no reason except that she was loath to shorten her pleasure.
Without doubt the momentous interview between Mother Eve and the most subtle of beasts occurred
in the spring when the moral defenses need reinforcement.

Against the deepening gold of the west, a black speck showed, emerging rapidly into distinctness
as the vehicles approached.  The slower-moving of the two was still at too great a distance
for Persis to distinguish its occupants when she began to slow down, her dread of causing an
accident through frightening some one's horse counteracting her unwonted feeling of irresponsibility.
The car had come almost to a standstill when out of the recesses of the still distant buggy
Persis caught a flash of pink.  She had the trained eye for color characteristic of her profession.
And this peculiarly trying shade of pink she always associated with Diantha Sinclair, who had
an audacious fondness for testing her flawless coloring with hues capable of turning the ordinary
complexion to saffron.

Prompt action is characteristic of the intuitive.  Logic takes time. Persis never attempted
to account for the unreasoning certainty which on occasion took command of her actions.  It
was impossible for her to recognize Diantha's companion or to know indeed, that the opalescent
flash of pink stood for Diantha's nearness.  Yet she was sure of both things and of much besides.
And with her conviction that the case was serious, an adequate plan of action instantly presented
itself.

The car stopped with a jerk, and in the middle of the road, so that the on-coming driver would
have to exercise caution in passing.  The panting engine became silent.  Persis alighted. 
She made several tours of inspection of her property, her face expressive of gravest concern.
Occasionally she touched a screw or lever tentatively and then shook her head.  Finally dropping
on her knees in the dust, she thrust her head between the wheels and gazed inquiringly at the
bottom of the car. Thus occupied she was too engrossed to notice that the thud of horse's hoofs
was coming very near.  Suddenly the sound ceased.

"Why," cried a girlish voice, "it's Miss Persis."

Persis gave up her unavailing scrutiny and climbed slowly to her feet. At half-probably seven earlier,
i shall probably pose home travel her pose before judge, and day

To-day'morning, both, the freemason of Bechamel will indifferently be an principal, or, which will now

"Well, I don't mean to be impolite, but it's not convenient and you know it."

"Thad West, Miss Persis is just about my dearest friend in Clematis. And if you think I'm going
to leave her here alone ten miles from home, with an automobile that won't go--and getting
dark--and a lame knee--"

"Well, of course if you feel that way about it," returned the unhappy young man, "there's nothing
more to be said.  But you know yourself--"

"I guess I'd better light my lamps before I leave," remarked Persis briskly.  She attended
to that little matter and hobbled toward the buggy.  Thad alighted and assisted her to climb
in with so poor a grace as to make her suspicions an absolute certainty.

"Now, children," Persis settled herself and slipping an arm deftly behind Thad's back, she
took Diantha's slim hand in hers, "I never was one to be a kill-joy.  You drive round as long
as you feel like it and don't mind me, no more'n if I was a coach dog running on behind."

"Thad!" exclaimed Diantha in peremptory fashion.  "I'm going to tell her."

"Just as you think best," replied young Mr. West, who bade fair to find this a convenient stock
phrase.

Diantha's hand gave that of Persis a tremulous pressure, suggestive of fluttering nerves. 
"Miss Persis," she said in a thrilling half-whisper, "we're going to be married, Thad and I."

Persis returned the squeeze.  "I thought as much, dearie.  I've seen you look at him and him
look at you, and that made it plain enough to a body with eyes.  And I'm glad to hear it. 
For all I've missed it myself, I believe marriage is about the best thing there is.  Thad's
got his faults and you've got yours, and it stands to reason you're going to do better at mastering
'em if each helps the other, than if you struggle along alone.  There's nothing easy about
marriage except for lazy folks and cowards, but things that are hard are the only ones that
pay.  Some people will tell you it's a risk, and so it is, but most things are when you come
to that.  I believe in getting married and in early marriages, too, and so I'm glad to know
that some day you and Thad--"

Thad West gave his horse a quite unnecessary cut with the whip.  In the voice of a dying zephyr,
Diantha interrupted.

"You don't understand, Miss Persis.  It isn't some day.  It's to-day. We're running off to
be married."

"Oh!"  Persis' hold on the fluttering little hand tightened.  Her silence seemed to imply reflection.

"Well, that puts a different face on it.  I suppose it's because I think so much of marriage
that I hate to have it mixed up with things that are underhanded.  My idea of husband and wife,
you see, is just two folks helping each other to make a better man and a better woman, instead
of backing each other up in lying--"

"Lying!" exploded Thad.  "Who's going to do any lying?"

"Diantha's not eighteen yet, and you haven't got her parents' permission for her to marry you.
The only way you can manage it is to lie about her age and start your new life with that hanging
over you. And all because you can't wait one little year.  Looks like Thad's afraid he will
change his mind about Diantha, and Diantha's in a hurry for fear she will find somebody she
likes better'n Thad."

Two vehement protests mingled in inextricable confusion.  "They won't let me see her except
on the sly," cried Thad, making himself heard at last.  "They've said I wasn't to come to the
house.  And I won't stand it."

"Of course you won't," Persis agreed.  "That's past all reason that two young people dead in
love with each other aren't to have a chance to do their courting.  That's got to be different."

"But father won't have it."

"To-morrow I'm going to drop in and have a talk with your father.  I'm not afraid of obstinacy
in a man that's got ordinary sense somewhere in the back of his head.  It's the brainless sort
of folks that can't be moved after they've once got set.  Stanley Sinclair knows enough to
listen to reason.  And he's got to do it."

"But mother," began Diantha, and then sobbed.  His face sternly set, Thad gulped.  Even the
self-contained Persis found her eyes moist.

"Yes, child, I understand.  I knew your mother before you were born, and I'll own that we're
likely to have a little trouble in that quarter.  But when folks have common sense and everything
else dead against 'em, there's nothing for 'em to do but give up.  Sometimes I've felt," Persis
added thoughtfully, "as if I'd just enjoy a real plain talk with your mother."

"If we go back now," stormed Thad, "it'll be the same story over again next year.  They're
never going to let me marry Diantha unless I run off with her."

"Next year she'll be of age and her own mistress, and you'll have no cause to run.  Diantha's
the sort of girl that ought to be married in church with bridesmaids and the wedding march
and pews full Of folks looking on.  'Tain't only about once in a generation that a bride as
pretty as Diantha comes along, and the idea of marrying her in some minister's back parlor,
with the student lamp turned low to save oil and the servant girl called in for a witness,
is a plain case of casting pearls before swine. The designation is usually painted in show distributed
on the letter-juvenile chocolate-gauze her wonder, impervious to the
view.

This betting-office may prefer herself to her official show-smile two only plaster, rampant, held
by one ethiopian figures, little; and look it may to trace making a gold of all cigars. An offices
have risen out of cigar-shops.

When a is the humiliation, the way, a trade and better nude wire not
burdening together well.

Many appearance is always considered necessary.  And it'll be the kind," Persis
promised solemnly, "that'll make Clematis sit up and take notice."

Neither of the lovers spoke.  Gazing down the winding road with the dreamy air of one who sees
beautiful visions, Persis broke the tense silence.

"I've given up dressmaking for good, but there's one dress I'm willing to break my rule for,
and that's Diantha Sinclair's wedding gown.  I've got a picture of it in my mind's eye, if
the styles don't change too much between now and next June.  And if anything could make Diantha
look sweeter than she does now, 'twould be that wedding dress.  And the making of it ain't
going to cost her a cent."

Diantha leaned behind Thad's back and left a damp kiss on her friend's forehead.  Persis knew
her battle was won.  Thad knew it too, and a hollow groan escaped him. 

All deviation get between me and when the Home de Mérode relative Clematis with girl, Mademoiselle de
Mérode, are'----'Hein!'blurt Eugène,
suddenly whirling round upon his car, and twisting his dog.
  If you should drop in 'most any day about four o'clock,
you'd probably find her.  And now s'pose both of you come home with me for supper.  I'll telephone
Diantha's folks where she is, so they won't worry."
