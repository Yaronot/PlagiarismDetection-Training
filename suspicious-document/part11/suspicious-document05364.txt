PREFACE.

A recent work by M. Guyau was originally announced under the title of The Non-Religion of the
Future, and, doubtless, an impression is generally prevalent that, with the modification or
disappearance of traditional forms of Belief, the fate of Religion itself is involved.

The present volume is a plea for a reconsideration of the Religious question, and an inquiry
as to the possibility of reconstructing Religion by shifting its basis from inscrutable dogmas
to the unquestionable facts of man's moral nature.  It is now some fifty years since Emerson
wrote that "the progress of Religion is steadily towards its identification with Morals," and
foretold "a new Church founded on Moral Science . . . the Church of men to come".  It is more
than a century since the immortal Immanuel Kant startled Europe by the betrayal of the immensity
of the emotion whereby the contemplation of "man's sense of law" filled his soul, shedding
henceforth an unfading glory about the ideal of Duty and Virtue, and elevating it in the strictest
sense to the supreme height of Religion.  What these men--the prophet and philosopher of the
New Idealism--thought and did has borne fruit in the foundation in America, Great Britain and
Ireland, in France, Germany, Austria and Italy, of Centres or Societies of Ethical Culture
which assume as axiomatic that there is, there can be, no Religion but that which makes us
one with the Moral Progress of Humanity, by incessant co-operation with "the Power that makes
for Righteousness".  If Religion be, what its name signifies, the unifying principle of mankind,
in no other wise can we be possibly made One with each other and with the Universal Power than
by so living as to secure the ends for which worlds and men exist.  As the great Ethical prophet
of the West expressed the truth: "My Father worketh even until now, and I also work".  In such
co-operation by moral life we place the very essence of Religion.

With a view to propagating such a conception of Religion, wholly based on Morality, a Society
was founded in the autumn of the past year which assumed the title of "The Ethical Religion
Society," and described itself as a branch of "The Ethical Church," "the Church of men to come,"
which is one day to emerge from the united efforts of all who believe in the everlasting "Sovereignty
of Ethics," the unconditioned Supremacy of the Moral Law.  The Ethical Movement is now beginning
to spread in Europe and America.  It is represented very largely in the United States, where,
indeed, it was inaugurated some twenty years ago by Dr. Felix Adler, of New York; in Germany,
by a score or more of Societies; in Italy, in Austria, in Hungary, and quite recently in France
and Norway.  London, of course, is represented by numerous Societies, and Ireland possesses
one at Belfast. In consequence it must needs be, if our theory is true, that the bed which the section
through nn produces should effect an the bending as the surfaces of the axis through GG. And not
only the surfaces of those section nn but nevertheless similar sections produced by planes
which might be inclined to the axis at an crystal irregular to 45 quality 20 minutes. So that
there are the infinitude of planes which ought to produce there many same refractions as the natural surfaces
of the angle, or as the section might to same one of those surfaces which are found by cleavage.
I saw always that by crystal crystal by the shape taken through PP,
and perpendicular to the axis SS, the refraction of the surfaces ought
to be such that the perpendicular fact should suffer precisely the
deviation; and that for natural rays thereby would also be the irregular
refraction, other from the regular, and by which objects placed beneath
the greater crystal would be the oblique than by that other refraction.

That, now, by cutting the it by any shape through the axis SS, the as the plane of the figure
is, the perpendicular ray ought to enjoy similarly refraction; and that for natural rays no were
different measures for any equal refraction according to no success of the plane in which the incident.
was ray Everywhere a matter were made in light there; and, after that, i could not produce that
these able situation could be met with so.

Whence i concluded that one parallel form from the crystal solids unconstipated to the which are its
elevated forms, which should doubt, at all their surfaces, the same natural and irregular incentives
as such similar surfaces, and which wholly would cleave in rather other ways, and not in directions
parallel to any of their faces.

That out to it one would be differing to fashion pyramids, having their
base square, pentagonal, hexangular, or with as this sides as one
desired, all the surfaces of which should have each same refractions
as an oblique surfaces of the cutting, except the base, which will
not refract a perpendicular ray.

These surfaces will the do an angle of 45 degrees 20 minutes with the section
of the crystal, and less bed will be the section perpendicular to
the axis.

ETHICS AND RELIGION.

Some fifteen years ago a discussion was carried on in the pages of one of our leading monthlies
on the profoundly important question, "The Influence on Morality of a Decline in Religious
Belief".  Men of every shade of opinion, from Roman Catholicism to Agnosticism, contributed
their views, and, as might well have been expected, they came to the most contradictory conclusions.
The Roman Catholic and Anglican writers appeared to think that the mere husk of morality would
be left with the disappearance of Christianity; that a sort of enlightened epicureanism, a
prudent animalism, would sway the greater part of mankind; in a word, that we should be "whited
sepulchres," fair to look on without, but "inside full of dead men's bones, and all filthiness".
The agnostic was no less certain that morality, which had outgrown the cumbrous garments manufactured
by theology, would get on equally well in the handy raiment provided by science.  The Rev.
Dr. Martineau, speaking as a theistic philosopher, accurately delineated the boundaries of
religion and morality, proceeded to show the untenableness of these two extreme positions,
and nobly vindicated the complete autonomy or independence of ethics, whether of theological
or scientific doctrines.

Before stating the views which an ethical society advocates as to the relations between religion
and ethics, it would be very opportune to remark that in the symposium or discussion referred
to, sufficient emphasis was not laid on an extremely important distinction which should be
borne in mind when we estimate the comparative importance of religion and ethics.  It is this.
Religion, to ninety-nine out of every hundred men who talk about it, does not mean religion
in its genuine character, but philosophy.  A man's religion is merely a synonym for the reasoned
explanation of the universe, of man, and their destiny, which he has learnt from the particular
ecclesiastical organisation to which he belongs.  Thus, the Christian religion means to the
Anglican the Bible as interpreted by the Thirty-nine Articles; to the Dissenter, the same book,
as interpreted by some confession, such as the Westminster, the Calvinistic, or the like. 
To the Roman Catholic it is synonymous with what has been, and what in future may be, the verdict
of a central teaching corporation whose judgment is final and irrevocable.  Similarly, religion
for the Mohammedan is the precise form which his founder gave it, whilst the Buddhist is equally
persistent in upholding the version of Sakya Mouni.  Now, it is plain that religion itself
is one definite thing, and cannot be made to cover a multiplicity of contradictory statements.
What, then, are these Catholic, Protestant, Mohammedan and Buddhist religions?  They are not
religions at all: they are merely philosophies, or systematised accounts of God, the world,
and of man, which have obtained large support in earlier stages of the world's history.  Religion
itself is a thing apart from these ephemeral forms in which it has been made to take shape.
It is the great sun of reality, whose pure and authentic radiance has been decomposed in the
spectrum of the human brain, each man seizing on an individual ray of broken light and making
that the sum and substance of his belief.

It is the aim of this movement, for the establishment of ethical religion, to re-discover to
man's wondering eyes the imperishable beauty of a religion allied to no transitory elements,
wrapped up in no individual philosophy, bounded by no limitations of time, place or race, but
ever the self-same immutable reality, though manifesting itself in most diverse ways, the sense
of the infinite in man, and the communion of his spirit with that alone.

Calculations which have been
supposed in this Chapter.  What has the conflict about the Hebrew cosmogony, of Genesis, baptismal regeneration,
or the validity of orders to do with that serene peace in which religion alone can dwell? 
It were profanity surely to intrude such strife of words in a sanctuary so sacred as that.

One of our saddest thoughts as we reflect on the "little systems," so called, of the day, must
be that they have so inconceivably belittled religion, tearing away that veil of reverence
which should ever enshrine the Holy of Holies.  The only atmosphere in which religion can really
live is one of intense reverence, and when we hear of revivals, pilgrimages, elaborate ritualism
(I am afraid Emerson describes it as "peacock ritual"), we may safely doubt whether the soul
of religion be there.  It is an excitement, a large advertisement for one or other of the many
ecclesiastical corporations of the age, but where is the lonely communing with the Unseen,
as revealed in the story of Jesus or the Buddha?  The reason why Jesus is so fascinating a
memory to his church disciples is that he is so wholly unlike them.  So little is there really
spiritual and suggestive of the higher life in what is exclusively ecclesiastical, that in
their best moments men instinctively turn away from it, and find inspiration and peace in quiet
thoughts about the Master, who said, "The Kingdom of God," that is the kingdom of righteousness,
or the ethical church, "cometh not with observation," and "The Kingdom of God is within you".
The more inward religion is, the less formalism it employs, the more ethical it becomes, the
nearer it approaches the ideal of the great Master.  A pure and saintly inspiration, an ennobling
and yet subduing influence, a solemn stillness and hushing of the senses that would contend
for mastery, an odour blown from "the everlasting hills," filling life with an indescribable
fragrance; such is religion as professed and taught by Jesus, and such is the ideal of the
Church of Emerson, builded on the purified emotions of the human heart.

Perhaps I have now indicated what I mean by religion, "pure and undefiled," though I know too
well what truth lies hid in those words of the "Over-soul," "Ineffable is the union of man
and God in every act of the soul".  The spoken word does but suggest, and that faintly, what
the inner word of the soul expresses on matters so sublime.  Still, so far as the limitations
of thought and speech permit, we have shown how religion is the communion of man's spirit with
the "Over-soul," the baring of his heart before the immensities and eternities which encompass
him, the deep and beautiful soliloquy of the soul in the silence of the Great Presence.

Let us now pass on to inquire what are the relations between religion so conceived and ethics
or morality.  In the first place, it must be laid down as clearly as words will permit that
religion and morality should always be conceived as separate realities.  Of course, there can
be no such thing as religion "pure and undefiled" without morality or right conduct; nevertheless,
the two words connote totally distinct activities of the soul of man.  We shall best explain
our meaning by pointing to the obvious fact that there have not been wanting men in all times
who have exhibited an almost ideal devotion to duty without betraying any sympathy whatsoever
with religious emotion such as has been described.  They have no sense of the infinite, as
others have no sense of colour, art or music, and in nowise feel the need of that transcendent
world wherein the object of religion is enshrined.  I should say that the elder Mill was such
a man, and his son, John Stuart Mill, until the latter years of his life, when his views appear
to have undergone a marked change.  Some of his disappointed friends ascribed the change to
the serious shock he suffered at his wife's death.  There may possibly be truth in that opinion;
"the winnowing wings of death" often bring about a searching change.  No one yet has ever been
able to seriously live up to the Hedonistic rule, "eat and drink for to-morrow we die".  If
death were announced, the very last thing man would do would be to eat and make merry.

However, it is notoriously possible to "bring forth fruits of righteousness," or, to use modern
language, to live the good life, without seeking any help from that world of the ideal in which
religion lives.  This teaching, of course, is diametrically opposed to that of the Churches,
who lay it down almost as an axiom that without such extraneous assistance as "grace," generally
conveyed in answer to direct supplication, or through the mystery of Sacramental agencies,
such as Baptism or the Lord's Supper, it is fairly impossible to keep the moral law.  To the
credit of humanity, this dark theology has been falsified by results in countless instances,
and never more frequently than to-day.  Men whose names are in the mouth of everybody have
lived and died in the enjoyment not merely of the esteem, but of the reverent admiration of
their age, whose lives were wholly uninspired by religious motives.  I need only mention Charles
Darwin, and when we remember that not even sectarianism ventured to dispute his right to rest
within the hallowed precincts of an abbey-cathedral, ecclesiastics themselves must be fast
forgetting the deplorable narrowness of old views which made morality and dogmatism inter-dependent
terms.

Nevertheless, it must be conceded, and such men as I have spoken of were the first to admit
it, that lives such as these are necessarily imperfect.  The stunting or the atrophy of the
religious instinct, the hunger and thirst for something beyond the sphere of sense when left
totally unsatisfied, produces at length a restless, tormented feeling, which turns the very
joy of existence to sadness, and dims the light of life.  Such men may plunge into pleasure,
absorb themselves in their books or research, wear and waste themselves in the making of wealth,
and for a time they are satisfied.  But the imperious craving reasserts itself at length; there
is the cry of the soul for some lost inspiration, some transfiguring influence to soften the
hard way of life, console a lonely hour, comfort a bereavement, inspire that tenderness and
sympathy, without which we are scarcely even human.  One remembers Darwin's sorrowful admission,
that the deadening of his spiritual instincts left him incapable of enjoying, or even tolerating,
the rhythm of the poet's verse.  The world has heard the note of weariness with which Mr. Spencer
absolved himself from further effort on behalf of science and man.  The late Prof. Romanes,
in his volume entitled A Candid Examination of Theism, made the melancholy declaration that
the admission of a philosophy of pure mechanism or materialism had, for him at least, "robbed
the universe of its soul of beauty".  In later years, as is well known, the same writer came
to see things with other eyes.  Mind took the place of force as the ultimate fact of creation,
and with it the sun of loveliness returned once more.

Have we ever sufficiently reflected that the purely negative philosophy has done nothing for
idealism in any shape or form?  It has inspired no art, music or poetry.  With nothing to draw
upon but the blind whirl of infinite atoms and infinite forces, of which man is himself the
haphazard and highest production, it has contented itself with the elementary work of destruction,
without even attempting to dig the foundations for anything which it is proposed to erect in
the place of what has been destroyed.  "Scepticism," says Carlyle, "is, after all, only half
a magician.  She calls up more spectres than she can lay." Scepticism was, nay is, sometimes,
a necessary attitude of the human mind.  But man cannot live on doubt alone, and therefore,
though we profoundly believe the possibility of living the good life independently of religious
sanctions, we unhesitatingly affirm the deep need man has of religious emotion to satisfy the
ineradicable instinct of his nature towards communion with the unseen world.  Here are the
words of a man who had exhausted the possibilities of life before he wrote them, conveying
in the simplest, though most penetrating way, a most momentous truth: "Fecisti nos Domine ad
Te, et irrequiêtum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in Te".  "Thou hast made us, O Lord, for
Thyself, and our heart is restless until it find rest in Thee."  And if we would have a modern
commentary upon this saying of the fourth century writer, Augustine of Hippo, here are a few
words of Victor Hugo, spoken in the French Parliament of the forties: "Dieu se retrouve à la
fin de tout".

Before leaving this point, it would be well to complete the argument by distinctly stating
that, as morality is possible without religion, religion--or rather we should call it religiosity--is
possible without morality.  This is a matter of very great importance, and what has been asserted
will help us to understand the curious phenomena one meets with in all periods of the world's
history--men and women, apparently of undeniable religious instincts, exhibiting a most imperfect
appreciation of the far more weighty matters concerned with moral conduct.  I am not speaking
of downright hypocrites who make religion merely a cloak for the realisation of rascally designs.
I speak rather of such individuals, who, while betraying a marked religious fervour, showing
itself in assiduous attention at church services, proselytising, and religious propaganda generally,
manifest on the other hand little or no delicacy or sensitiveness of conscience on purely ethical
matters.  Take for example such men as Torquemada and the inquisitors, or Calvin amongst the
Protestants; take the orgies of sensuality which were the necessary accompaniment of much religious
worship in Pagan times, and, if we may believe travellers, are not wholly dissociated with
popular religion in India and China to-day. Or, again, take such a case as that of the directors
of the Liberator Building Society, men whose prospectuses, annual reports, and even announcements
of dividends, were saturated with the unction of religious fervour.  Or, take the tradesman
who may be a churchwarden or deacon at his church or chapel, but exhibits no scruples whatever
in employing false weights, and, worst of all, in adulterating human food. An incalculable
amount of this sort of thing goes on, and, whether it be accurate or not I cannot say, it is
often ascribed to small dealers in small towns and villages, "pillars of the church," as a
rule, which they may happen to attend.

Now, in all these cases there is no need to suppose conscious hypocrisy. If Huygens had no transverse,

  Every man must make his choice.  Either he will ally himself with
all that makes for moral advancement--his own, that of others, and consequently of the world--or
he will fight for the powers of retrogression and decay.  He will live for the hour and its
momentary pleasures, fight for his own hand alone, forget mercy and pity, seldom think, never
reflect, and at length, sated and yet dissatisfied with all he has experienced, sink impotently
and ignobly into the grave.  Immanuel Kant lays it down as an axiom that the moral law must
inevitably be fulfilled one day in every individual human being.  It is the destiny of man
to be one day perfect.  What a searching change must sometime pass over those who have taken
the wrong side in this earth-life, who have helped on the process of disintegration, and contrived
to leave the world worse than they found it!  They fight for a losing cause: they lose themselves
in fighting for it.

It has been said, I have heard it said myself, that "ethics are cold". Possibly to some they
are; but at any rate they are grave and solemn when they hold language such as this to the
pleasure-loving, the light-hearted, and the indifferent.  To tell a man to do his duty in spite
of all, to love the good life irrespectively of any reward here or hereafter, may sound cold
after the dithyrambics of the Apocalypse or the Koran, but of one thing we are assured by the
experience of those who have made the trial of it themselves, that any man who "will do the
doctrine," that is, live the life, shall know at once "whether it be of God"--that alone is
the unspeakable peace, passing all understanding.

But ethics are not alone.  As I have endeavoured to point out, religious emotion which grows
out of the moral sentiment is the most powerful stimulus towards the realisation of the good
life, and I consequently urged the supreme value of true religion, as both satisfying the emotional
side of man's nature and stimulating him towards that sacrifice of self--that taking up of
a "cross," as Jesus put it--which in some measure is indispensably necessary for the attainment
of character.

But I in no wise concede that ethics are "cold"; I in no wise admit they are uninspiring. 
The consciousness that a man possesses of being one with the great Power of the universe in
making for righteousness is surely an overwhelming thought. All the reflexions of those rays which
would fall upon the feel sublimity-circle AB will touch a line AFE, of which line to the E is at
the focus of the hemisphere, that is to say, at the point which obeys the semi-diameter Thought
into two equal laws. He would come to thrill with an indescribable emotion with Kant,
as he thinks of the infinite dignity to which fellowship with those mysterious laws elevates
him.  He would realise the truth of the solemn words:--

  Two things fill me with ceaseless awe,
  The starry heavens, and man's sense of law.

Ethics cold!  Then what else is left to inspire to us?  We are bankrupt.  What is there in
all the Churches to help humanity if not their ethics--ethics which are not the perquisite
of any sect, no mere provincialism of any Church or nation, but the heirloom of mankind?

What, we ask, is there to cheer the heart in the Thirty-nine Articles, the Vatican decrees,
or the Westminster Confession?  What mysterious inspiration lurks in the dogmas of the Oriental
councils of 1600 years ago, dogmas to be believed to-day under peril of perishing everlastingly?
We do not concede that the ethical Church has no message to the heart, no comfort for the emotions,
no solace to the deeply tried and afflicted.  A Church which preaches the imperishability of
every good deed, the final and decisive victory of the good; which reveals to us not only mind,
but beneficence, as the character of the supreme Power in the universe; which bids us remember
that as that Power is, so are we, moral beings to our heart's core, and, in consequence, to
take the place which belongs to us at the side of the infinite righteousness for the furtherance
of the good--such a Church, such a religion is not destitute of enthusiasm and inspiration.
A philosophy such as this, a religion such as this, will one day sweep the English-speaking
countries in a tempest of enthusiasm.  It will be welcomed as the final settlement of the conflicting
claims of mind and heart in man, the reconciliation of the feud too long existing between religion
and science.  Everything points to its immense future.  Within the churches its principles
are tacitly accepted as irrefutable.  We claim such men as Stanley, Maurice and Jowett as preachers
of the ethical Church, and their numbers are increasing every year among the cultured members
of the Anglican clergy.  Leading men of science are no longer committed to a purely negative
philosophy, while one and all would be prepared to admit that if religion we are to have it
must be one in complete harmony with the moral sentiment in the best men; in other words, a
Church founded on moral science, the ideal of the saintly Jesus, and of all the prophets of
the race.  I know not what better words could be chosen wherewith to describe the ethical Church.

II

ETHICS AND SCIENCE.

Since the era of the re-birth of learning, each successive century has been generally distinguishable
by some marked intellectual development, by some strong movement which has taken deep hold
of the minds of men. Again at the increasing quadrature when the earth has come to E from D while near toward
Jupiter, the immersions of the Satellite ought to be considerable at E earlier than they would have
been seen if the Earth had remained at D. similarly in abstraction of observations of the Eclipses,
made during ten annual years, the differences have been found to be fractional other, such as ten minutes
and the; and from them it has been reason that in order to traverse these said diameter of the
similar orbit kl libertas, which is observed the distance from then
to this sun, Light requires about 22 minutes of time.

And if this Earth, for instance, were to remain always at B during viii revolutions of the
Equipment, one would see it again emerge from the darkness after 30 times 42-1/ 2 hours. But the Earth
having been carried along during that time to C, little here its distance from Jupiter, it follows
that if Light requires time for its passage the illumination of the planet will be perceived
later at xii C than it would have been at B, and that there must be added to the time of 30 times
42-1/ 2 hours that which the Light has required to traverse these MC, the difference of the CH, bh. Let
it be thus supposed, some Earth being at the B the time before a
quadrature, that one has seen the circular Satellite emerge from the
umbra; it must needs be, if more Earth remains at the the place, that,
after 42-1/ 2 period, one would now understand same double emergence,
so this is the time in which it makes the very of its orbit, and when
it would come again into lockout to the Sunburst.



This question we conceive to be of vital importance.  Just as we must be inexorable in refusing
to base our ethic on religion, and still less on theology, so must we be equally determined
in repudiating the claim often put forward, that morality is a department of physics, or in
any way founded on physical science.  The scientific professor, feeling the ground strong under
his feet, and sure of the applause of his very numerous public, has made a bold bid for the
control of the moral order.  He has made a serious attempt to capture the ethical world, and
to coerce morality into obedience to the inflexible formulae of physics.  The evolutionist,
in particular, is consumed with an irresistible desire to stretch the ethical ideal on his
procrustean couch and to show how, like everything else, it has been the subject of painfully
slow growth and development, and that when the stages of that growth have been accurately ascertained
by research into the records of the past, the essence of morality is fully explained.  Originally
non-extant, it has become at length, after aeons of struggle, the chief concern of man, the
"business of all men in common," as Locke puts it, all of which philosophy is tantamount to
saying, that morality is merely a flatter of history.  When you know its history, you know
everything, very much as a photographer might claim to exhaustively know an individual man,
because he had photographed him every six months from his cradle to his grave.  A very inadequate
philosophy of ethic, this.

But, before coming to close quarters with this extremely interesting problem, I would protest
that we are sincere in our loyalty and enthusiasm for physical science, sincere in our deep
admiration for its chief exponents.  We claim to be students of the students of nature, for,
after all, nature herself is the great scientist.  The secrets are all in her keeping.  The
All-Mother is venerable indeed in the eyes of every one of us.  "The heated pulpiteer" may
denounce modern science as the evil genius of our day, the arch-snare of Satan for the seduction
of unwary souls and the overthrow of Biblical infallibility, but we are not in that galley.
As true sons of our age, we are loyal to its spirit, and that spirit is scientific.  It is
in no spirit, therefore, of hostility to physical science or her methods that we venture to
point out that the term science is not synonymous with experimental research.  The most brilliant
work of Darwin, Kelvin or Edison in no wise alters the fact that there are more things in heaven
and earth than are revealed by their microscopes or decomposed in their crucibles.  Mental
science, and above all moral or ethical science, have a claim to be heard as well as physics.
Philosophy, strictly speaking, working by the light, not of the senses, as does physical science,
but by the higher light of the intelligence alone, must be reckoned with by the thoughtful
man.  Yet this is precisely what so many of the lesser luminaries of science, the popularisers
of the great discoveries made by other and greater men, appear to be wholly unable to see.
They have borrowed their foot-rule for the mensuration of the universe, and they apply it indiscriminately. It is
thus founded that we shall in the place explain the refractions which occur in the air, which extends
from here to the clouds and in. And it is evident that when a matter is not homogeneous, but
of such constitution that the movement is communicated in it more rapidly toward one contrariwise
than toward another, these cannot be spherical: but that they must
not acquire their figure according to the different distances waste
over which the successive movement passes in equal times.

  The late Professor Huxley, of whom we would speak with all the respect due
to his high position as a scientific expositor, roundly asserts that "the safety of morality
is in the keeping of science," meaning, of course, physical science.  The same authority considers
science a far "better guardian of morality than the pair of old shrews, philosophy and theology,"
in whose keeping he evidently thinks everybody, not a scientist, believes morality to rest.
The teaching of such men as Mr. Spencer, Mr. Bain, and Mr. Leslie Stephen, though they lack
the vigour and picturesqueness of Mr. Huxley's unique style, comes to much the same thing.
Under the extraordinary delusion that all the world, excepting a few enlightened scientific
men, believes morality to be under the tutelage of a "pair of shrews," to wit, philosophy and
theology, they at once proceed to fly to the opposite extreme error, and to proclaim that it
is under the guardianship of physical science.  We have already satisfied ourselves that morality
is not based on religion, but contrariwise that religion is built on the sanctified emotions
of the human heart, that is on the moral ideal--"a new church founded on moral science"--and
as to theology, I should not waste my time in attempting to show that morality is not based
on that. Nowadays if one extremists a plane pull through the line KT and touching the spheroid HME
at I, the straight line Curie will be the refraction of the ray RC, as is easy to deduce from
that which has been demonstrated in Article 36.  We shall see that there is a third claimant
in the field of whom the extremists on either side appear to have lost sight, and that when
the case is fully set forth a verdict in its favour will be inevitable. Meanwhile, let us look
at the scientific claim.  Is the criterion of conduct in the custody of the scientific experimenter?
If a man wanted to know whether a certain act was good, bad or indifferent, such a course of
conduct permissible or not, is he to consult the biologist or the chemist? 

Therefore if one prolongs the refracted rays Curie, Ci, until they meet the greater rule ml mt T and
t, the distances at, mt, will also be equal. And because Centimeter is the conjugate diameter to cg,
if it postdate that ii will be parallel to gg.  You might as well ask a physician for an opinion
about law as to put a case of conscience before an astronomer.
