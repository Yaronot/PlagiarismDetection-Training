This cat, a strange creature coloured like a tawny lion, with face, tail, and paws a chocolate
brown, and large bright-blue eyes staring uncannily from his dark countenance, possibly had
more affection than his haughty manner indicated, for, after his mistress's death, he refused
food and soon followed her into the other world, if so be that cats are admitted there.

In this house were gathered all the heirlooms, books, old furniture, pictures, and other interesting
objects which had been brought down from San Francisco. The St. Gaudens medallion of Stevenson
was fitted into a niche over the mantelpiece in the living-room, where Mrs. Stevenson spent
much of her time seated before the great fireplace with the haughty Kitson on her lap. On the
mantelshelf there was a curious collection of photographs--one of Ah Fu, the Chinese cook of
South Sea memory, side by side with that of Sir Arthur Pinero, famous playwright--silent witnesses
to the wide extent of her acquaintance and the broad democracy of her ideas.

At Stonehedge her life ran on almost undisturbed in the calm stillness that she loved so much.
Now and then she went for a day's fishing at Serena, a place on the shore a few miles from
Stonehedge. With its background of high, rugged hills and the calm summer sea at its feet it
has a serene beauty that well befits its name.

At infrequent intervals people of note arriving in Santa Barbara sought her out, and though
she received them graciously she was equally interested in the visit of an Italian gardener
and his wife, who came to bring her a present of some rare plant, and with whom she had most
delightful talks about the flowers of the tropics. She was much pleased, too, when one day
a Scotch couple, plain, kindly people, came merely to look at the house where the widow of
their great countryman lived. When they came she happened to be in the garden and they apologized
for the intrusion and were about to withdraw, but the moment she recognized the accent she
welcomed them with outstretched hands. When they left their carriage was loaded with flowers,
and she stood on the veranda waving her hand in farewell.

In August, 1909, accompanied by her daughter, Mr. Field, her nephew Louis Sanchez, and the
maid Mary Boyle, she went on a motor trip to Sausal in Lower California, where they found that
the house had been broken into by duck hunters, and presented a forlorn appearance. Coming
from the comfort of Stonehedge to this deserted cabin was something of a shock to the rest
of the party, and but for Mrs. Stevenson they would have left at once. "Mrs. Robinson Crusoe,"
however, justified her name with such enthusiasm that the others caught fire. Louis Sanchez
lent a ready hand to repairs and under his magic fingers doors swung upon their hinges, tables
ceased to wabble, door-knobs turned, and even a comfortable rocking-chair "for Tamaitai" emerged
from a hopeless wreck. Mrs. Strong and Mary Boyle assaulted the little cabin with soap and
water and disinfectants, and with much courage and laughter routed two swarms of bees which
had taken possession of the ceiling. Mr. Field supplied the larder with game and fish, and
ran the automobile to town for supplies. Mrs. Stevenson, who, at Stonehedge, was always somewhat
dismayed by the morning demands of the cook for the day's orders, delighted in surprising the
party with unexpected good dishes which she cooked with her own hands.

As the years passed her health began to show distinct signs of breaking, and when she proposed
another trip to Mexico in the spring of 1910, her family feared she was not strong enough to
endure the fatigue, but as she herself said she "would rather go to the well and be broken
than be preserved on a dusty shelf," they finally agreed.

She had had a great admiration for Mexico ever since her first visit, and wanted to show her
daughter the land she said was "older and more interesting" than any country she had ever seen.
Then, as her nephew was a mining engineer recently graduated from the University of California,
she hoped to find a good opening for him in that land of gold and silver. The three set off
in high spirits, for there was nothing Mrs. Stevenson liked better than change of scene.

Although during this time in Mexico City she found the altitude very trying in its effect on
her heart, and was in consequence obliged to keep rather quiet, yet she was able to move about
to a certain extent and to see some of the sights of the place. She loved to sit by the Viga
Canal and watch the life of the people ebb and flow along its tree-lined stretches--the queer
old flat-bottomed and square-ended boats coming in on work days with vegetables and flowers
from the so-called "floating gardens," and on days of fiesta transformed into pleasure craft
with gay streamers and flags. On moonlight nights the tinkle of guitars sounded everywhere
on the still waters of the canal and far out on the lake, for it is the custom of well-to-do
people to hire these boats and with their musicians spend the evening à la Venice.

In the city the travellers were much interested in the Monte de Piedad, the pawn shop which
is run under State control. Here great bargains may sometimes be picked up in jewels left there
by ladies of good family in reduced circumstances. Mrs. Stevenson had a very feminine liking
for jewels, but they had to be different from the ordinary sort to attract her, and she was
much pleased to pick up in Mexico some pieces of the odd and barbaric designs that she especially
liked.

Delightful days were spent in the city prowling about the queer old shops and buying curious
things that are not to be found in other parts of the world. This was the kind of shopping
that she really enjoyed--this poking about in strange, romantic places.

Among the very few people that Mrs. Stevenson met in Mexico in a social way was the well-known
historian and archaeologist, Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, whom she considered a most charming and interesting
woman. Together with her daughter she lunched with Mrs. Nuttall at her picturesque house, once
the home of Alvarado, in the outskirts of Mexico City. It was the oldest house they had ever
seen, and, with its inner patio, outside stairways and balconies, and large collection of rare
idols, pots, and weapons that Mrs. Nuttall had herself unearthed from old Indian ruins, was
intensely interesting.

What, always, would you do?
 I call this message characteristic,
because I find in her letters such passages as this: 'Please, dear Cummy, always let me know
instantly when there is anything in the world I can do to add to your comfort, your happiness,
or your pleasure. There is so little I can do for you, and I wish to do so much. You and I
are the last; and we must help each other all we can, until we, too, follow.'"[74]

              [Footnote 74: Quoted by courtesy of Lord Guthrie.]

When Cummy died Mrs. Stevenson was represented at the funeral by Mr. A. P. Melville, W. S.,
and a wreath ordered by her was placed on the coffin. She also bore the expense of Cummy's
last illness and funeral and had a handsome tombstone put up in her memory.

In these days the sands began to run low in the hour-glass of the life of Fanny Stevenson,
and a great weariness seemed to be settling upon her. Writing to Mr. Scribner in June, 1913,
she says: "All my life I have taken care of others, and yet I have always wanted to be taken
care of, for naturally I belong to the clinging vine sort of woman; but fate seems still against
me." Nevertheless, I truly believe she enjoyed being the head of her clan, the fairy godmother,
the chieftainess of her family, to whom all came for help and counsel. But now the shadows
of evening were growing long, and she was getting very, very tired.

But, world-weary as she was, she consented at this time to prepare for publication in book
form the notes which she had taken, primarily for her husband's use, of one of their voyages
in the South Seas. As it happened, he made little use of the notes, so that most of it was
new material. In this work, for dear memory's sake, she took a real pleasure, of which she
speaks in the preface in these words: "The little book, however dull it may seem to others,
can boast of at least one reader, for I have gone over this record of perhaps the happiest
period of my life with thrilling interest." The book was brought out by Charles Scribner's
Sons, under the title of The Cruise of the "Janet Nichol", and it has a melancholy interest,
apart from its contents, as the last work done by her in this life. She had only finished the
reading of the proofs a few days before her death, and the book did not appear until some months
afterwards.

In November, 1913, she was threatened with asthma, and in consequence went to spend some time
at Palm Springs, a health resort on the desert in southeastern California. In the dry, clear
air of that place her health improved so wonderfully that all her friends and family believed
that a crisis had passed, and that she had fortunately sailed into one of those calm havens
which so often come to people in their later years. She returned to Stonehedge seemingly well.
All their fears were lulled, and the blow was all the more crushing when, on the 18th of February,
1914, silently and without warning, she passed from this life. In the manner of her death and
that of her husband there was a striking coincidence; each passed away suddenly, after only
a few hours of unconsciousness, from the breaking of an artery in the brain. The story of her
last moments may best be told in the words of a letter from her devoted maid, Agnes Crowley,[75]
which is so sincere and touching that I quote it without eliminations:

              [Footnote 75: Her former maid, Mary Boyle, had married
              and left her service.]

"My dear Mrs. Sanchez:

"We are a very sad little household--we are all heart-broken, to think our dear little Madam
has gone away never to return. It seems too awful, and just when she was enjoying everything.
We were home from Palm Springs just one week when she was taken away from us--but you can console
yourself by thinking that she was surrounded by love and devotion. She was not sick and did
not suffer. Tuesday evening, February 17, she felt well and read her magazines until nine o'clock,
and Mr. Field played cards with her till 10.30. Then she retired. The next morning I went in
to attend to her as usual, and there was my dear little Madam lying unconscious. I thought
at first she was in a faint, and I quickly ran for Mr. Field; he jumped up and put on his bathrobe
and went to her while I called Dr. Hurst. It took the doctor about seven minutes to get here,
and as soon as he saw her he said it was a stroke, but he seemed to be hopeful and thought
he could pull her through. He put an ice pack on her head and gave her an injection in the
arm and oxygen to inhale, and she seemed to begin to breathe natural, and we all hoped, but
it was in vain. She never regained consciousness, and at two o'clock she just stopped breathing,
so you see she did not suffer. But oh Mrs. Sanchez, we all seemed so helpless--we all loved
her so and yet could do nothing. Dr. Hurst worked hard from 8.30 till two o'clock, and when
the end came he cried like a little child, for he loved Mrs. Stevenson very much. It was an
awful blow to us all--it was so sudden. This place will never seem the same to William and
me, for we loved our little Madam dearly, and it was a pleasure to do anything for her--for
she was always so gentle and sweet. I adored her from the first time I ever saw her, and will
always consider it the greatest pleasure of my life to have had the privilege of waiting upon her.

          "I remain very affectionately,

                                        "Agnes Crowley."

When the angel of death stooped to take her he came on the wings of a wild storm, which raged
that week all through the Southwest--fitting weather for the passing of the "Stormy Petrel."
Railroads were flooded all over the country, and her son, Lloyd Osbourne, was delayed by washouts
for some days on the way out from New York. On his arrival the body was removed to San Francisco,
where a simple funeral ceremony was held in the presence of a few sorrowing friends and relatives.
On her bier red roses, typical of her own warm nature, were heaped in masses. A touching incident,
one that it would have pleased her to know, was the appearance of Fuzisaki, her Japanese gardener
at Stonehedge, with a wreath of beautiful flowers. It was in accordance with her own wish,
several times expressed to those nearest her, that her body was cremated and the ashes later
removed to Samoa, there to lie beside her beloved on the lonely mountain top.

To her own family the sense of loss was overwhelming, and I cannot perhaps express it better
than in the words of her grandson, Austin Strong: "To say that I miss her means nothing. Why,
it is as if an Era had passed into oblivion. She was so much the Chief of us all, the Ruling
Power. God rest her soul!"

       *       *       *       *       *

When Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson passed from this earth the news of her death carried a pang
of grief to many a heart in far distant lands. One who knew her well, her husband's cousin,
Graham Balfour, writes his estimate of her character in these words:

"Although I had met Fanny Stevenson twice in England, I first came to know her on my arrival
at Vailima in August, 1892, when within a single day we established a firm friendship that
only grew closer until her death. The three stanzas by Louis so completely expressed her that
it seems useless for a man to add anything or to refine upon it:

     'Steel-true and blade-straight
      .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
      Honor, anger, valor, fire,
      A love that life could never tire,
      .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . Her integrity and her directness were such that
one could, and frequently did, differ from her and express the
difference in the strongest terms without leaving a trace of
bitterness.

"I remember in particular a scheme which she wished to set on foot for releasing Mataafa and
other Samoan chiefs from their exile in the German island of Jaluit and carrying them off to
Australia. The project was a wild one and would only have led to their return and disgrace,
and in these terms and much stronger expressions we discussed it, without ever abating one
jot from our personal friendship.

"And in the long years that followed absence made no difference. Every letter, when it came,
was as full of affection and of confidence as its predecessors--full of loyalty and tenderness.

"To her enemies, of course, she showed another side. Opposition she did not mind, but dishonesty
and deceit were unforgivable.

"The news of her death reached me in St. Helena, as the announcement of Louis's death found
me on another far-off island in the Carolinas; and both times the world became a colder, greyer,
more monotonous place."

In speaking of literature's great debt to her, Lord Guthrie says:

"Without her Louis's best work neither could nor would have existed. In studying the life and
works of Thomas Carlyle I often had occasion to contrast his wife and Louis's. With all Mrs.
Carlyle's great and attractive qualities and her undoubted influence on her husband, she made
his work difficult by her want of perspective, magnifying molehills into mountains. It could
not be said that any of his great writings owed their existence to her."

An article appearing in the Literary Digest shortly after her death touches upon this point:

"Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson was content to remain in the background and let her husband reap
all the glory for his literary achievements, and the result was that her part in his career
had probably been minimized in the public mind. She was a great deal more than a mere domestic
help meet."

From her old and attached friend, Mr. S. S. McClure, comes this sincere tribute:

"The more I saw of the Stevensons the more I became convinced that Mrs. Stevenson was the unique
woman in the world to be Stevenson's wife.... When he met her her exotic beauty was at its
height, and with this beauty she had a wealth of experience, a reach of imagination, a sense
of humor, which he had never found in any other woman. Mrs. Stevenson had many of the fine
qualities that we usually attribute to men rather than to women; a fair-mindedness, a large
judgment, a robust, inconsequential philosophy of life, without which she could not have borne,
much less shared with a relish equal to his own, his wandering, unsettled life, his vagaries,
his gipsy passion for freedom. She had a really creative imagination, which she expressed in
living. She always lived with great intensity, had come more into contact with the real world
than Stevenson had done at the time when they met, had tried more kinds of life, known more
kinds of people. When he married her, he married a woman rich in knowledge of life and the world.

"She had the kind of pluck that Stevenson particularly admired. He was best when he was at
sea, and although Mrs. Stevenson was a poor sailor and often suffered greatly from seasickness,
she accompanied him on all his wanderings in the South Seas and on rougher waters, with the
greatest spirit. A woman who was rigid in small matters of domestic economy, who insisted on
a planned and ordered life, would have worried Stevenson terribly.

"A sick man of letters never married into a family so well fitted to help him make the most
of his powers. Mrs. Stevenson and both of her children were gifted; the whole family could

He would have been a link between her and the old associations of the Vailima life, and his
engagement to an English girl proved to her that this would no longer be possible. Yet where
a less fine nature would have contented itself with the mere formal congratulations as all
that could be possible under the circumstances, she gave generous sympathy to a stranger, who
caused her fresh loss, from her generous 'steel-true' heart.

              [Footnote 78: Sir Graham Balfour's Samoan name.]

"I had been married about two years when Mrs. Stevenson came to England in 1898, and we were
living at Oxford. I was naturally a little nervous as to my first introduction to her. My husband
wanted to take me up to London to see her, but I asked to go alone, feeling somehow that it
would be easier. To this day I remember the trepidation with which I followed the parlor maid
upstairs in Oxford Terrace, and was ushered into the room where a lady of infinite dignity
was lying on a sofa. It seems to me now that after one steady look from those searching 'eyes
of gold and bramble dew' (which had rather the effect of a sort of spiritual X-ray), I lost
my feeling of being on approval, and in ten minutes I was sitting on the floor beside the sofa,
pouring out my own past history in remarkable detail, and feeling as if I had known Tamaitai
for years.

"In the following summer, 1899, she came to stay with us at Oxford, to give Palema all the
help she could about the life of Robert Louis Stevenson he had just undertaken at her urgent
request. Incidentally, she was to be introduced to her godson, our eldest boy Gilbert, who
was then about six months old. She gave him a christening present of a silver bowl for his
bread and milk, upon a silver saucer which could be reversed and used also as a cover. She
spoke enthusiastically of Sir Frederick Treves, who had performed it and had refused any fee,
saying he counted it a privilege to attend her. I have a clear picture of her in my mind, lying
on the sofa in our drawing-room. The door opened and the nurse carried in the baby, barefooted.
'Ah,' she said to him, 'who's this coming in hanging out ten pink rosebuds at the tail of his
frock?' And the little pink toes justified a description that only she would have so worded.

"We drove her round to a few of the most beautiful and characteristic of the Oxford colleges.
She was easily fatigued, but she delighted in what she saw. I remember admiring her pretty
feet, clad in quite inadequate but most dainty black satin shoes, with very high heels, and
fine silk stockings. When I put my admiration into words she just smiled upon me delightfully
but said nothing.

"One evening we talked desultorily about the 'criminal instinct.' 'Well,' I said at last, 'there's
one thing certain, I should never commit a murder. I shouldn't have the courage when it came
to the point!' 'Oh,' said she, 'I could murder a person if I hated him enough for anything
he had done, but I should have to call upon him in the morning and tell him I was going to
murder him at five o'clock.'

"We dined out with some Oxford friends, among whom was a tall Scotch professor who was a brilliant
and quick talker. Tamaitai took no part in the rapid thrust and parry of the talk, but sat
silently looking from one to another with her great dark eyes. Their comment on her long afterwards
was that she was the most inscrutable person they had ever met. As we drove home after the
party I asked Tamaitai: 'What did you think of the talk?' There was a brief silence--then:
'I didn't understand a single word of it, they talked so fast,' said she frankly.

"I don't think I ever knew a woman who was a more perfect 'gentleman.' Scorning all that was
not direct, and true, and simple, she herself hated disguise or casuistry in any form. Her
eyes looked through your soul and out at the other side, but you never felt that her judgment,
whatever it was, would be harsh. She was curiously detached, and yet you always wanted her
sympathy, and if she loved you it never failed you. She was a strong partisan, which was perhaps
the most feminine part of her character. She was wholly un-English, but she made allowances
for every English tradition. My English maids loved her without understanding her in the least.
I never knew any one that had such a way as she had of turning your little vagaries and habits
and fads to your notice with their funny side out, so that all the time you were subtly flattered
and secretly delighted."

I wish I had the power to describe that mysterious charm which drew to her so many and such
various people--the high and the low in far-scattered places of the earth--but it was too elusive
to put in words. Perhaps a large part of it lay in her clear simplicity, her utter lack of
pretence or pose. I remember reading once in a San Francisco newspaper a comment by a writer
who seemed to touch nearly upon the heart of the secret. The paragraph runs thus:

"Once a man told me that Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson was the one woman in the world he could
imagine a man being willing to die for. Every man I asked--every single man, rich and poor,
young or old, clever or stupid--all agreed about Mrs. Stevenson, that she was the most fascinating
woman he had ever seen. It was some years ago that I saw her, but I would know her again if
I saw her between flashes of lightning in a stormy sea. Individuality--that was her charm.
She knew it and she had sense enough to be herself. Individuality and simple unaffected honesty
of speech and action and look are the most potent charms and the most lasting that any woman
can ever hope to have."

Her broad sympathies, too, had much to do with it. If there is any word in the English language
that means the opposite of snob, it may certainly be applied to her. She picked out her friends
for the simple and sufficient reason that she liked them, and they might and did include a
duchess, a Chinese, a great English playwright, a French fisherman, a saloon-keeper who was
once shipwrecked with her, a noted actor--and so on through a long and varied list. Once in
Sydney when she was out walking with her daughter, both richly dressed, she stopped suddenly
to shake hands with a group of black-avised pirates (to all appearances) with rings in their
ears. She had met them somewhere among the islands, and her little white-gloved hand grasped
their big brown ones with genuine and affectionate friendship. Wide apart as she and her husband
were in many things, in their utter lack of snobbery they were as one. Once they were at a
French watering-place when from their room upstairs they heard a loud uproar below. A voice
cried: "I will see my Louis!" Going out to see what the trouble was, Louis found four French
fishermen in a char-à-bancs--all in peasant blouses. The major-domo of the fashionable hotel
was trying to keep them out, but when Louis appeared he called out their names joyfully, and
they all cried: "Mon cher Louis!" After each had embraced him, he asked them up to his rooms,
and, despite the ill-concealed scorn of the waiter, ordered up a grand dinner for them. They
were the French fishermen he had known at Monterey, California, and one may be sure that they
met with as cordial a welcome from his wife as from himself. I know that in one of her letters
she urges him not to forget to write to François the baker, at Monterey, saying: "It seems
to me much more necessary to write some word to him than to Sir Walter, or Baxter, or Henley,
for they are your friends who know you and will not be disappointed, either in a pleasure or
in humanity, as this poor baker will be. Indeed you must write and say something to him."

As has been said, her dislike of deceit and treachery was one of the most strongly marked traits
in her character. Once when she had reason to fear that a person whom she was befriending was
deceiving her, and she was told that a simple inquiry would settle the matter, she replied:
"But I couldn't bear to find out that he is lying to me."

Her charities were many, but they were always of the quiet, unobtrusive sort, of which few
heard except those most nearly concerned. This being comprehend of 77 Mr. Constable Tritium., who
postdate the official, he applied his cane, by any management or measure, to the berm of the
excessively interesting executioner. The amanuensis backwards became more pitiful. The beadle
to no means could be predominate upon to-- strike hard, which provoked
the lawman finds to strike firmly; and this tanning continued, till
a lass of S Silver-End, under the official immediately endure to the
hands of the pitiless lawman, he joined the procession, and telling
herself immediately by the latter, prehend him by his capillary work,
and placing him did thus without the same, slapped his face pitying
a most Amazon fury. Yet, just when you thought you were beginning to understand her nature--with
its love and hate of the primal woman--her anger would suddenly soften, not into tenderness,
but into a sort of dispassionate wisdom, and she would quote her favourite saying: "To know
all is to forgive all."

That she had infinite tenderness for the feelings of others, living or dead, she proved every
day. In a letter to Mr. Scribner asking advice about the publication in London of certain letters
of her husband, she says:

"Some of the letters that are intended to go into the book should not, in my judgment, appear
at all. When my husband was a boy in his late 'teens' and early twenties he and his father--a
rigid old Calvinist--quarrelled on the subject of religion. Louis being young enough to like
the melodrama, it took on an undue importance, out of all keeping with the real facts. During
this turbulent period Louis poured out his soul in letters, the publication of many of which
would give a false impression of the relations between the son and the father. Louis was twenty-five
when I first met him, and the period of the religious discussion was long past. Mr. Thomas
Stevenson loved me and was as kind to me as though I were his own daughter. I cannot, for the
sake of an extra volume that would produce a certain amount of money, do anything that in my
heart would seem disloyal to the dear old man's memory--all the more because he is dead."

In her character there were many strange contradictions, and I think sometimes this was a part
of her attraction, for even after knowing her for years one could always count on some surprise,
some unexpected contrast which went far in making up her fascinating personality. Notwithstanding
the broad view that she took of life in most of its aspects, in some things she was old-fashioned.
She was never reconciled, for instance, to female suffrage, and once when she was persuaded
to attend a political meeting at which her daughter was one of the speakers, she sat looking
on with mingled pride in her daughter's eloquence and horror at her sentiments. Yet, after
the suffrage was granted to women in California, her family was amused to see her go to the
polls and vote and carefully advise the men employed on her place concerning their ballots.
