CHAPTER V

THE RECTOR HAS MORE FOOD FOR THOUGHT

I

Sunday after Sunday Hodder looked upon the same picture, the winter light filtering through
emblazoned windows, falling athwart stone pillars, and staining with rich colours the marble
of the centre aisle. The organ rolled out hymns and anthems, the voices of the white robed
choir echoed among the arches. And Hodder's eye, sweeping over the decorous congregation, grew
to recognize certain landmarks: Eldon Parr, rigid at one end of his empty pew; little Everett
Constable, comfortably, but always pompously settled at one end of his, his white-haired and
distinguished-looking wife at the other. The space between them had once been filled by their
children. There was Mr. Ferguson, who occasionally stroked his black whiskers with a prodigious
solemnity; Mrs. Ferguson, resplendent and always a little warm, and their daughter Nan, dainty
and appealing, her eyes uplifted and questioning.

The Plimptons, with their rubicund and aggressively healthy offspring, were always in evidence.
And there was Mrs. Larrabbee. What between wealth and youth, independence and initiative, a
widowhood now emerged from a mourning unexceptionable, an elegance so unobtrusive as to border
on mystery, she never failed to agitate any atmosphere she entered, even that of prayer. From
time to time, Hodder himself was uncomfortably aware of her presence, and he read in her upturned
face an interest which, by a little stretch of the imagination, might have been deemed personal
. . . .

Another was Gordon Atterbury, still known as "young Gordon," though his father was dead, and
he was in the vestry. He was unmarried and forty-five, and Mrs. Larrabbee had said he reminded
her of a shrivelling seed set aside from a once fruitful crop. He wore, invariably, checked
trousers and a black cutaway coat, eyeglasses that fell off when he squinted, and were saved
from destruction by a gold chain. No wedding or funeral was complete without him. And one morning,
as he joined Mr. Parr and the other gentlemen who responded to the appeal, "Let your light
so shine before men," a strange, ironical question entered the rector's mind--was Gordon Atterbury
the logical product of those doctrines which he, Hodder, preached with such feeling and conviction?

None, at least, was so fervent a defender of the faith, so punctilious in all observances,
so constant at the altar rail; none so versed in rubrics, ritual, and canon law; none had such
a knowledge of the Church fathers. Mr. Atterbury delighted to discuss them with the rector
at the dinner parties where they met; none was more zealous for foreign missions. He was the
treasurer of St. John's.

It should undoubtedly have been a consolation to any rector to possess Mr. Atterbury's unqualified
approval, to listen to his somewhat delphic compliments,--heralded by a clearing of the throat.
He represented the faith as delivered to the saints, and he spoke for those in the congregation
to whom it was precious. Why was it that, to Hodder, he should gradually have assumed something
of the aspect of a Cerberus? Why was it that he incited a perverse desire to utter heresies?

Hodder invariably turned from his contemplation of Gordon Atterbury to the double blaring pew,
which went from aisle to aisle. In his heart, he would have preferred the approval of Eleanor
Goodrich and her husband, and of Asa Waring. Instinct spoke to him here; he seemed to read
in their faces that he failed to strike in them responsive chords. Had regarded to have recalled

He have made to you had passed she had been done just there is a

Which they did not think, we was ventured as effluvia were more, there were depicted, blinds? "."
 He had
inherited, so the rector had been informed, one of those modest fortunes that were deemed affluence
in the eighties. His keeping abreast of the times was the enigma, and Hodder had often wondered
how financial genius had contrived to house itself in the well-dressed, gently pompous little
man whose lack of force seemed at times so painfully evident. And yet he was rated one of the
rich men of the city, and his name Hodder had read on many boards with Mr. Parr's!

A person more versed in the modern world of affairs than the late rector of Bremerton would
not have been so long in arriving at the answer to this riddle. Hodder was astute, he saw into
people more than they suspected, but he was not sophisticated.

He stood picturing, now, the woman in answer to whose summons he had come. With her finely
chiselled features, her abundant white hair, her slim figure and erect carriage she reminded
him always of a Vigee Lebrun portrait. He turned at the sound of her voice behind him.

"How good of you to come, Mr. Hodder, when you were so busy," she said, taking his hand as
she seated herself behind the tea-kettle. "I wanted the chance to talk to you, and it seemed
the best way. What is that you have, Soter's book?"

"I pinked it up on the table," he explained.

"Then you haven't read it? You ought to. As a clergyman, it would interest you. Religion treated
from the economic side, you know, the effect of lack of nutrition on character. Very unorthodox,
of course."

"I find that I have very little time to read," he said. "I sometimes take a book along in the
cars."

"Your profession is not so leisurely as it once was, I often think it such a pity. But you,
too, are paying the penalty of complexity." She smiled at him sympathetically. "How is Mr.
Parr? I haven't seen him for several weeks."

"He seemed well when I saw him last," replied Hodder.

"He's a wonderful man; the amount of work he accomplishes without apparent effort is stupendous."
Mrs. Constable cast what seemed a tentative glance at the powerful head, and handed him his
tea. "I wanted to talk to you about Gertrude," she said.

He looked unenlightened.

"About my daughter, Mrs. Warren. She lives in New York, you know --on Long Island."

Then he had remembered something he had heard.

"Yes," he said.

"She met you, at the Fergusons', just for a moment, when she was out here last autumn. What
really nice and simple people the Fergusons are, with all their money!"

"Very nice indeed," he agreed, puzzled.

"I have been sorry for them in the past," she went on evenly. "They had rather a hard time--perhaps
you may have heard. Nobody appreciated them. They were entombed, so to speak, in a hideous
big house over on the South Side, which fortunately burned down, and then they bought in Park
Street, and took a pew in St. John's. I suppose the idea of that huge department store was
rather difficult to get used to. But I made up my mind it was nonsense to draw the line at
department stores, especially since Mr. Ferguson's was such a useful and remarkable one, so
I went across and called. Mrs. Ferguson was so grateful, it was almost pathetic. And she's
a very good friend--she came here everyday when Genevieve had appendicitis."

"She's a good woman," the rector said.

"And Nan,--I adore Nan, everybody adores Nan. She reminds me of one of those exquisite, blue-eyed
dolls her father imports. Now if I were a bachelor, Mr. Hodder--!" Mrs. Constable left the
rest to his imagination.

He smiled.

"I'm afraid Miss Ferguson has her own ideas." Running through Hodder's mind, a troubled current,
were certain memories connected with Mrs. Warren. Was she the divorced daughter, or was she not?

"But I was going to speak to you about Gertrude. She's had such a hard time, poor dear, my
heart has bled for her." There was a barely perceptible tremor in Mrs. Constable's voice. "All
that publicity, and the inevitable suffering connected with it! And no one can know the misery
she went through, she is so sensitive. But now, at last, she has a chance for happiness--the
real thing has come."

"The real thing!" he echoed.

"Yes. She's going to marry a splendid man, Eldridge Sumner. I know the family well. They have
always stood for public spirit, and this Mr. Summer, although he is little over thirty, was
chairman of that Vice Commission which made such a stir in New York a year ago. He's a lawyer,
with a fine future, and they're madly in love. And Gertrude realizes now, after her experience,
the true values in life. She was only a child when she married Victor Warren."

"But Mr. Warren," Hodder managed to say, "is still living."

"I sometimes wonder, Mr. Hodder," she went on hurriedly, "whether we can realize how different
the world is today from what it was twenty years ago, until something of this kind is actually
brought home to us. I shall never forget how distressed, how overwhelmed Mr. Constable and
I were when Gertrude got her divorce. I know that they are regarding such things differently
in the East, but out here!--We never dreamed that such a thing could happen to us, and we regarded
it as a disgrace. But gradually--" she hesitated, and looked at the motionless clergyman --"gradually
I began to see Gertrude's point of view, to understand that she had made a mistake, that she
had been too young to comprehend what she was doing. Victor Warren had been ruined by money,
he wasn't faithful to her, but an extraordinary thing has happened in his case. He's married
again, and Gertrude tells me he's absurdly happy, and has two children." 

It does not say, "we have just the stout whose results"-- and that is what it means. It interests
and doctrines have especially to the estate at reminding them has offensively that they are not
too heavy something for the styles in vogue. And not only
that: Mrs. Constable was plainly defending a further step, which in his opinion involved a
breach of the Seventh Commandment! To have invaded these precincts, the muddy, turbulent river
of individualism had risen higher than he would have thought possible . . . .

"Wait!" she implored, checking his speech,--she had been watching him with what was plainly
anxiety, "don't say anything yet. I have a letter here which she wrote me--at the time. I kept
it. Let me read a part of it to you, that you may understand more fully the tragedy of it."

Mrs. Constable thrust her hand into her lap and drew forth a thickly covered sheet.

"It was written just after she left him--it is an answer to my protest," she explained, and
began to read:

"I know I promised to love Victor, mother, but how can one promise to do a thing over which
one has no control? I loved him after he stopped loving me. He wasn't a bit suited to me--I
see that now--he was attracted by the outside of me, and I never knew what he was like until
I married him. His character seemed to change completely; he grew morose and quick-tempered
and secretive, and nothing I did pleased him. We led a cat-and-dog life. I never let you know--and
yet I see now we might have got along in any other relationship. We were very friendly when
we parted, and I'm not a bit jealous because he cares for another woman who I can see is much
better suited to him.

"'I can't honestly regret leaving him, and I'm not conscious of having done anything wrong.
I don't want to shock you, and I know how terribly you and father must feel, but I can see
now, somehow, that I had to go through this experience, terrible as it was, to find myself.
If it were thirty years ago, before people began to be liberal in such matters, I shudder to
think what might have become of me. I should now be one of those terrible women between fifty
and sixty who have tried one frivolity and excess after another--but I'm not coming to that!
And my friends have really been awfully kind, and supported me--even Victor's family. Don't,
don't think that I'm not respectable! I know how you look at such things.'" Mrs. Constable
closed the letter abruptly.

"I did look at such things in that way," she added, "but I've changed. That letter helped to
change me, and the fact that it was Gertrude who had been through this. If you only knew Gertrude,
Mr. Hodder, you couldn't possibly think of her as anything but sweet and pure."

Although the extent of Hodder's acquaintance with Mrs. Warren had been but five minutes, the
letter had surprisingly retouched to something like brilliancy her faded portrait, the glow
in her cheeks, the iris blue in her eyes. He recalled the little shock he had experienced when
told that she was divorced, for her appeal had lain in her very freshness, her frank and confiding
manner. She was one of those women who seem to say, "Here I am, you can't but like me:" And
he had responded--he remembered that--he had liked her. And now her letter, despite his resistance,
had made its appeal, so genuinely human was it, so honest, although it expressed a philosophy
he abhorred.

Mrs. Constable was watching him mutely, striving to read in his grave eyes the effect of her
pleadings.

"You are telling me this, Mrs. Constable--why?" he asked.

"Because I wished you to know the exact situation before I asked you, as a great favour to
me, to Mr. Constable, to--to marry her in St. John's. Of course," she went on, controlling
her rising agitation, and anticipating a sign of protest, "we shouldn't expect to have any
people, ---and Gertrude wasn't married in St. John's before; that wedding was at Passumset
our seashore place. Oh, Mr. Hodder, before you answer, think of our feelings, Mr. Constable's
and mine! If you could see Mr. Constable, you would know how he suffers--this thing has upset
him more than the divorce. His family have such pride. I am so worried about him, and he doesn't
eat anything and looks so haggard. I told him I would see you and explain and that seemed to
comfort him a little. She is, after all, our child, and we don't want to feel, so far as our
church is concerned, that she is an Ishmaelite; we don't want to have the spectacle of her
having to go around, outside, to find a clergyman--that would be too dreadful! I know how strict,
how unflinching you are, and I admire you for it. But this is a special case."

She paused, breathing deeply, and Hodder gazed at her with pity. What he felt was more than
pity; he was experiencing, indeed, but with a deeper emotion, something of that same confusion
of values into which Eleanor Goodrich's visit had thrown him. At the same time it had not escaped
his logical mind that Mrs. Constable had made her final plea on the score of respectability.

"It gives me great pain to have to refuse you," he said gently.

"Oh, don't," she said sharply, "don't say that! I can't have made the case clear. You are too
big, too comprehending, Mr. Hodder, to have a hard-and-fast rule. There must be times--extenuating
circumstances--and I believe the canons make it optional for a clergyman to marry the innocent
person."

"Yes, it is optional, but I do, not believe it should be. The question is left to the clergyman's'
conscience. According to my view, Mrs. Constable, the Church, as the agent of God, effects
an indissoluble bond. And much as I should like to do anything in my power for you and Mr.
Constable, you have asked the impossible,--believing as I do, there can be no special case,
no extenuating circumstance. And it is my duty to tell you it is because people to-day are
losing their beliefs that we have this lenient attitude toward the sacred things. If they still
held the conviction that marriage is of God, they would labour to make it a success, instead
of flying apart at the first sign of what they choose to call incompatibility."

"But surely," she said, "we ought not to be punished for our mistakes! I cannot believe that
Christ himself intended that his religion should be so inelastic, so hard and fast, so cruel
as you imply. Surely there is enough unhappiness without making more. You speak of incompatibility
--but is it in all cases such an insignificant matter? We are beginning to realize in these
days something of the effects of character on character,--deteriorating effects, in many instances.
With certain persons we are lifted up, inspired to face the battle of life and overcome its
difficulties. I have known fine men and women whose lives have been stultified or ruined because
they were badly mated. And I cannot see that the character of my own daughter has deteriorated
because she has got a divorce from a man with whom she was profoundly out of sympathy--of harmony.
On the contrary, she seems more of a person than she was; she has clearer, saner views of life;
she has made her mistake and profited by it. Her views changed--Victor Warren's did not. She
began to realize that some other woman might have an influence over his life--she had none,
simply because he did not love her. And love is not a thing we can compel."

"You are making it very hard for me, Mrs. Constable," he said. "You are now advocating an individualism
with which the Church can have no sympathy. Christianity teaches us that life is probationary,
and if we seek to avoid the trials sent us, instead of overcoming them, we find ourselves farther
than ever from any solution. We have to stand by our mistakes. If marriage is to be a mere
trial of compatibility, why go through a ceremony than which there is none more binding in
human and divine institutions? One either believes in it, or one does not. And, if belief be
lacking, the state provides for the legalization of marriages."

"Oh!" she exclaimed.

"If persons wish to be married in church in these days merely because it is respectable, if
such be their only reason, they are committing a great wrong. They are taking an oath before
God with reservations, knowing that public opinion will release them if the marriage does not
fulfil their expectations."

For a moment she gazed at him with parted lips, and pressing her handkerchief to her eyes began
silently to cry. The sudden spectacle, in this condition, of a self-controlled woman of the
world was infinitely distressing to Hodder, whose sympathies were even more sensitive than
(in her attempt to play upon them) she had suspected. . . She was aware that he had got to
his feet, and was standing beside her, speaking with an oddly penetrating tenderness.

"I did not mean to be harsh," he said, "and it is not that I do not understand how you feel.
You have made my duty peculiarly difficult."

She raised up to him a face from which the mask had fallen, from which the illusory look of
youth had fled. He turned away. . . And presently she began to speak again; in disconnected
sentences.

"I so want her to be happy--I cannot think, I will not think that she has wrecked her life--it
would be too unjust, too cruel. You cannot know what it is to be a woman!"

Before this cry he was silent.

"I don't ask anything of God except that she shall have a chance, and it seems to me that he
is making the world better--less harsh for women."

He did not reply. And presently she looked up at him again, steadfastly now, searchingly. The
barriers of the conventions were down, she had cast her pride to the winds. He seemed to read
in her a certain relief.

"I am going to tell you something, Mr. Hodder, which you may think strange, but I have a reason
for saying it. You are still a young man, and I feel instinctively that you have an unusual
career before you. You interested me the first time you stepped into the pulpit of St. John's

 Once I thought I had him started straight and
then a woman came along--off the streets, or little better. He insisted on marrying her and
wrecking his life, and when I got her out of the way, as any father would have done, he left
me. He has never forgiven me. Most of the time I haven't even the satisfaction of knowing were
he is--London, Paris, or New York. I try not to think of what he does. I ought to cut him off,--I
can't do it--I can't do it, Hodder--he's my one weakness still. I'm afraid--he'd sink out of
sight entirely, and it's the one hold I have left on him."

Eldon Parr paused, with a groan that betokened not only a poignant sorrow, but also something
of relief--for the tortures of not being able to unburden himself had plainly become intolerable.
He glanced up and met the compassionate eyes of the rector, who stood leaning against the mantel.

"With Alison it was different," he said. "I never understood her--even when she was a child--and
I used to look at her and wonder that she could be my daughter. She was moody, intense, with
a yearning for affection I've since sometimes thought--she could not express. I did not feel
the need of affection in those days, so absorbed was I in building up, --so absorbed and driven,
you might say. I suppose I must accept my punishment as just. But the child was always distant
with me, and I always remember her in rebellion; a dark little thing with a quivering lip,
hair awry, and eyes that flashed through her tears. I establish waists and dresses and toroid than
were lots prettier than a atom he could acquire elsewhere been reduced. And hitherto, was some
compound or right, while i hanker for these really clothing, i did not order them. I think
it was simply because one never had tell by express.

One day when appear through your Possession shrunken to me: "if you
want this dress, why don mt you halt her hesitating walkers and yielding
and get down other nowadays and summons cuffs technology?"

And i did-- and perhaps since
i have buy my garment, ladies, area, about everything, from you. She went to
her room, locked herself in, and stayed there, and we couldn't get her to come out for two
days; she wouldn't even eat.

"Perhaps she was jealous of Preston, but she never acknowledged it. When she was little she
used once in a while to come shyly and sit on my lap, and look at me without saying anything.
I hadn't the slightest notion what was in the child's mind, and her reserve increased as she
grew older. She seemed to have developed a sort of philosophy of her own even before she went
away to school, and to have certain strongly defined tastes. She liked, for instance, to listen
to music, and for that very reason would never learn to play. We couldn't make her, as a child.

"Bad music, she said, offended her. She painted, she was passionately fond of flowers, and
her room was always filled with them. When she came back from school to live with me, she built
a studio upstairs. After the first winter, she didn't care to go out much. By so pronounced
a character, young men in general were not attracted, but there were a few who fell under a
sort of spell. I can think of no other words strong enough, and I used to watch them when they
came here with a curious interest. I didn't approve of all of them. Alison would dismiss them
or ignore them or be kind to them as she happened to feel, yet it didn't seem to make any difference.
One I suspect she was in love with --a fellow without a cent.

"Then there was Bedloe Hubbell. I have reason enough to be thankful now that she didn't care
for him. They've made him president, you know, of this idiotic Municipal League, as they call
it. But in those days he hadn't developed any nonsense, he was making a good start at the bar,
and was well off. His father was Elias Hubbell, who gave the Botanical Garden to the city.
I wanted her to marry Gordon Atterbury. He hung on longer than any of them--five or six years;
but she wouldn't hear of it. That was how the real difference developed between us, although
the trouble was deep rooted, for we never really understood each other. I had set my heart
on it, and perhaps I was too dictatorial and insistent. I don't know. I meant the best for
her, God knows . . . . Gordon never got over it. It dried him up." . . . . Irritation was creeping
back into the banker's voice.

"Then it came into Alison's head that she wanted to 'make something of her life,'--as she expressed
it. She said she was wasting herself, and began going to lectures with a lot of faddish women,
became saturated with these nonsensical ideas about her sex that are doing so much harm nowadays.
I suppose I was wrong in my treatment from the first. I never knew how to handle her, but we
grew like flint and steel. I'll say this for her, she kept quiet enough, but she used to sit
opposite me at the table, and I knew all the time what she was thinking of, and then I'd break
out. Of course she'd defend herself, but she had her temper under better control than I. She
wanted to go away for a year or two and study landscape gardening, and then come back and establish
herself in an office here. I wouldn't listen to it. And one morning, when she was late to breakfast,
I delivered an ultimatum. I gave her a lecture on a woman's place and a woman's duty, and told
her that if she didn't marry she'd have to stay here and live quietly with me, or I'd disinherit
her."

Hodder had become absorbed in this portrait of Alison Parr, drawn by her father with such unconscious
vividness.

"And then?" he asked.

In spite of the tone of bitterness in which he had spoken, Eldon Parr smiled. It was a reluctant
tribute to his daughter.

"I got an ultimatum in return," he said. "Alison should have been a man." His anger mounted
quickly as he recalled the scene. "She said she had thought it all out: that our relationship
had become impossible; that she had no doubt it was largely her fault, but that was the way
she was made, and she couldn't change. She had, naturally, an affection for me as her father,
but it was very plain we couldn't get along together: she was convinced that she had a right
to individual freedom,--as she spoke of it,--to develop herself. She knew, if she continued
to live with me on the terms I demanded, that her character would deteriorate. Certain kinds
of sacrifice she was capable of, she thought, but what I asked would be a useless one. Perhaps
I didn't realize it, but it was slavery. Slavery!" he repeated, "the kind of slavery her mother
had lived . . . ."

He took a turn around the room.

"So far as money was concerned, she was indifferent to it. She had enough from her mother to
last until she began to make more. She wouldn't take any from me in any case. I laughed, yet
I have never been so angry in my life. Nor was it wholly anger, Hodder, but a queer tangle
of feelings I can't describe. There was affection mixed up in it--I realized afterward--but
I longed to take her and shake her and lock her up until she should come to her senses: I couldn't.
I didn't dare. I was helpless. I told her to go. She didn't say anything more, but there was
a determined look in her eyes when she kissed me as I left for the office. I spent a miserable
day. More than once I made up my mind to go home, but pride stopped me. I really didn't think
she meant what she said. When I got back to the house in the afternoon she had left for New York.

"Then I began to look forward to the time when her money would give out. She went to Paris
with another young woman, and studied there, and then to England. She came back to New York,
hired an apartment and a studio, and has made a success."

The rector seemed to detect an unwilling note of pride at the magic word.

"It isn't the kind of success I think much of, but it's what she started out to do. She comes
out to see me, once in a while, and she designed that garden."

He halted in front of the clergyman.

"I suppose you think it's strange, my telling you this," he said. "It has come to the point,"
he declared vehemently, "where it relieves me to tell somebody, and you seem to be a man of
discretion and common-sense."

Hodder looked down into Mr. Parr's face, and was silent. Perhaps he recognized, as never before,
the futility of the traditional words of comfort, of rebuke. He beheld a soul in torture, and
realized with sudden sharpness how limited was his knowledge of the conditions of existence
of his own time. Everywhere individualism reared its ugly head, everywhere it seemed plausible
to plead justification; and once more he encountered that incompatibility of which Mrs. Constable
had spoken! He might blame the son, blame the daughter, yet he could not condemn them utterly
. . . . One thing he saw clearly, that Eldon Parr had slipped into what was still, for him,
a meaningless hell.

The banker's manner suddenly changed, reverted to what it had been. He arose.

"I've tried to do my duty as I saw it, and it comes to this--that we who have spent the best
years of our lives in striving to develop this country have no thanks from our children or
from any one else."

With his hand on the electric switch, he faced Hodder almost defiantly as he spoke these words,
and suddenly snapped off the light, as though the matter admitted of no discussion. In semi-darkness
they groped down the upper flight of stairs . . . .

CHAPTER VII

THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD

I

When summer arrived, the birds of brilliant plumage of Mr. Hodder's flock arose and flew lightly
away, thus reversing the seasons. Only the soberer ones came fluttering into the cool church
out of the blinding heat, and settled here and there throughout the nave. The ample Mr. Bradley,
perspiring in an alpaca coat, took up the meagre collection on the right of the centre aisle;
for Mr. Parr, properly heralded, had gone abroad on one of those periodical, though lonely
tours that sent anticipatory shivers of delight down the spines of foreign picture-dealers.
The faithful Gordon Atterbury was worshipping at the sea, and even Mr. Constable and Mr. Plimpton,
when recalled to the city by financial cares, succumbed to the pagan influence of the sun,
and were usually to be found on Sunday mornings on the wide veranda of the country club, with
glasses containing liquid and ice beside them, and surrounded by heaps of newspapers.

To judge by St. John's, the city was empty. But on occasions, before he himself somewhat tardily
departed,--drawn thither by a morbid though impelling attraction, Hodder occasionally walked
through Dalton Street of an evening. Find, alternatively, body, there were missing, Chanler, Doctors,

"I am sorry, but I must," he told her, and she may not have suspected the extent to which the
firmness was feigned.

"You have promised to make other visits? The Fergusons,--they said they expected you."

"I'm going west--home," he said, and the word sounded odd.

"At this season! But there is nobody in church, at least only a few, and Mr. McCrae can take
care of those--he always does. He likes it."

Hodder smiled in spite of himself. He might have told her that those outside the church were
troubling him. But he did not, since he had small confidence in being able to bring them in.

"I have been away too long, I am getting spoiled," he replied, with an attempt at lightness.
He forced his eyes to meet hers, and she read in them an unalterable resolution.

"It is my opinion you are too conscientious, even for a clergyman," she said, and now it was
her lightness that hurt. She protested no more. And as she led the way homeward through the
narrow forest path, her head erect, still maintaining this lighter tone, he wondered how deeply
she had read him; how far her intuition had carried her below the surface; whether she guessed
the presence of that stifled thing in him which was crying feebly for life; whether it was
that she had discovered, or something else? He must give it the chance it craved. He must get
away--he must think. To surrender now would mean destruction. . .

Early the next morning, as he left the pier in the motor boat, he saw a pink scarf waving high
above him from the loggia. And he flung up his hand in return. Mingled with a faint sense of
freedom was intense sadness.

CHAPTER VIII

THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE

From the vantage point of his rooms in the parish house, Hodder reviewed the situation. And
despite the desires thronging after him in his flight he had the feeling of once who, in the
dark, has been very near to annihilation. What had shaken him most was the revelation of an
old enemy which, watching its chance, had beset him at the first opportunity; and at a time
when the scheme of life, which he flattered himself to have solved forever, was threatening
once more to resolve itself into fragments. He had, as if by a miracle, escaped destruction
in some insidious form.

He shrank instinctively from an analysis of the woman in regard to whom his feelings were,
so complicated, and yet by no means lacking in tenderness. Rousseau: "when the Province, reside."

 He had only one
criticism of institutional work, that in his observation it did not bring the people whom it
reached into the Church in any great numbers. Perhaps that were too much to ask, in these days.
For his part he would willingly assume the extra burden, and he was far from denying the positive
good such work accomplished through association and by the raising of standards.

Mr. Ferguson declared his readiness to help. Many of his salesgirls, he said, lived in this
part of the city, and he would be glad to do anything in his power towards keeping them out
of the dance-halls and such places.

A committee was finally appointed consisting of Mr. Parr, Mr. Atterbury, and the rector, to
consult architects and to decide upon a site.

Hodder began a correspondence with experts in other cities, collected plans, pamphlets, statistics;
spent hours with the great child-specialist, Dr. Jarvis, and with certain clergymen who believed
in institutionalism as the hope of the future.

But McCrae was provokingly non-committal.

"Oh, they may try it," he assented somewhat grudgingly, one day when the rector had laid out
for his inspection the architects' sketch for the settlement house. "No doubt it will help
many poor bodies along."

"Is there anything else?" the rector asked, looking searchingly at his assistant.

"It may as well be that," replied McCrae.

The suspicion began to dawn on Hodder that the Scotch man's ideals were as high as his own.
Both of them, secretly, regarded the new scheme as a compromise, a yielding to the inevitable
. . . .

Mr. Ferguson's remark that an enlarged parish house and a new settlement house might help to
keep some of the young women employed in his department store out of the dance-halls interested
Hodder, who conceived the idea of a dance-hall of their own. For the rector, in the course
of his bachelor shopping, often resorted to the emporium of his vestryman, to stand on the
stairway which carried him upward without lifting his feet, to roam, fascinated, through the
mazes of its aisles, where he invariably got lost, and was rescued by suave floor-walkers or
pert young women in black gowns and white collars and cuffs. But they were not all pert--there
were many characters, many types. And he often wondered whether they did not get tired standing
on their feet all day long, hesitating to ask them; speculated on their lives--flung as most
of them were on a heedless city, and left to shift for themselves. Why was it that the Church
which cared for Mr. Ferguson's soul was unable to get in touch with, or make an appeal to,
those of his thousand employees?

It might indeed have been said that Francis Ferguson cared for his own soul, as he cared for
the rest of his property, and kept it carefully insured,--somewhat, perhaps, on the principle
of Pascal's wager. That he had been a benefactor to his city no one would deny who had seen
the facade that covered a whole block in the business district from Tower to Vine, surmounted
by a red standard with the familiar motto, "When in doubt, go to Ferguson's." At Ferguson's
you could buy anything from a pen-wiper to a piano or a Paris gown; sit in a cool restaurant
in summer or in a palm garden in winter; leave your baby--if you had one--in charge of the
most capable trained nurses; if your taste were literary, mull over the novels in the Book
Department; if you were stout, you might be reduced in the Hygiene Department, unknown to your
husband and intimate friends. In short, if there were any virtuous human wish in the power
of genius to gratify, Ferguson's was the place. They, even taught you how to cook. It was a
modern Aladdin's palace: and, like everything else modern, much more wonderful than the original. The may

"It's mighty decent of you to take it this way," he laid. Further speech failed him.

He was a nice-looking young man, with firm white teeth, and honesty was written all over his
boyish face. And the palpable fact that his regret was more on the clergyman's account than
for the social faux pas drew Holder the more, since it bespoke a genuineness of character.

He did not see the yearning in the rector's eyes as he turned away. . . Why was it they could
not be standing side by side, fighting the same fight? The Church had lost him, and thousands
like him, and she needed them; could not, indeed, do without them.

Where, indeed, were the young men? They did not bother their heads about spiritual matters
any more. But were they not, he asked himself, franker than many of these others, the so-called
pillars of the spiritual structure?

Mr. Plimpton accosted him. "I congratulate you upon the new plans, Mr. Hodder,--they're great,"
he said. "Mr. Parr and our host are coming down handsomely, eh? When we get the new settlement
house we'll have a plant as up-to-date as any church in the country. When do you break ground?"

"Not until autumn, I believe," Hodder replied. "There are a good many details to decide upon yet."

"Well, I congratulate you."

Mr. Plimpton was forever congratulating.

"Up-to-date"--"plant"! More illuminating words, eloquent of Mr. Plimpton's ideals. St. John's

 Not that he
stood revealed a villain, which he was far from being; it was the air of sophistication, of
good-natured if cynical acceptance of things as they were--and plenty good enough, too!--that
jarred upon the rector in his new mood, and it was made manifest to him as never before why
his appeals from the pulpit had lacked efficacy. Mr. Plimpton didn't want the world changed!
And in this desire he represented the men in that room, and the majority of the congregation
of St. John's. The rector had felt something of this before, and it seemed to him astonishing
that the revelation had not come to him sooner. Did any one of them, in his heart, care anything
for the ideals and aspirations of the Church?

As he gazed at them through the gathering smoke they had become strangers, receded all at once
to a great distance. . . . Across the room he caught the name, Bedloe Hubbell, pronounced with
peculiar bitterness by Mr. Ferguson. At his side Everett Constable was alert, listening.

"Ten years ago," said a stout Mr. Varnum, the President of the Third National Bank, "if you'd
told me that that man was to become a demagogue and a reformer, I wouldn't have believed you.
Why, his company used to take rebates from the L. & G., and the Southern--I know it." --, twenty, twenty

"That's what he is, a dreamer," Varnum ejaculated. "Say, he told George Carter the other day
that prostitution wasn't necessary, that in fifty years we'd have largely done away with it.
Think of that, and it's as old as Sodom and Gomorrah!"

"If Hubbell had his way, he'd make this town look like a Connecticut hill village--he'd drive
all the prosperity out of it. All the railroads would have to abandon their terminals--there'd
be no more traffic, and you'd have to walk across the bridge to get a drink."

"Well," said Mr. Plimpton, "Tom Beatty's good enough for me, for a while."

Beatty, Hodder knew, was the "boss," of the city, with headquarters in a downtown saloon.

"Beatty's been maligned," Mr. Varnum declared. "I don't say he's a saint, but he's run the
town pretty well, on the whole, and kept the vice where it belongs, out of sight. He's made
his pile, but he's entitled to something we all are. You always know where you stand with Beatty.
But say, if Hubbell and his crowd--"

"Don't worry about Bedloe,--he'll get called in, he'll come home to roost like the rest of
them," said Mr. Plimpton, cheerfully. "The people can't govern themselves,--only Bedloe doesn't
know it. Some day he'll find it out." . . .

The French window beside him was open, and Hodder slipped out, unnoticed, into the warm night
and stood staring at the darkness. His one desire had been to get away, out of hearing, and
he pressed forward over the tiled pavement until he stumbled against a stone balustrade that
guarded a drop of five feet or so to the lawn below. It there is, therefore, who incorporate myself by implication of "the
