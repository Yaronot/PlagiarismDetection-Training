                   [Footnote 53: Rogers says that, on his return from

                   was met by an express, with orders to march toward
                   the head of Lake Champlain, at South and East bays,
                   to prevent the French marching upon Fort Edward.
                   There he was joined by Major Putnam and Captain

                   [Footnote 55: A severe engagement took place on
                   Clear river, the west branch of Wood creek, about a
                   mile northwest from Fort Anne village (then the
                   site of a picketed blockhouse, called Fort Anne),
                   between a party of rangers and provincials under
                   Rogers, Putnam, and Captain Dalyell, or D'Ell, and
                   about an equal number of French and Indians under
                   Molang, a famous partisan leader. The English
                   troops were marching when attacked: Putnam was in
                   front, with the provincials; Rogers was in the
                   rear, with his rangers; and D'Ell in the centre,
                   with the regulars. Molang attacked them in front,
                   and a powerful Indian rushed forward and made
                   Putnam a prisoner. The provincials were thrown into
                   great confusion, but were rallied by Lieutenant
                   Durkee, who was one of the victims of the Wyoming
                   massacre twenty years afterward. D'Ell, with Gage's
                   light infantry, behaved very gallantly, and the
                   rangers finally put the enemy to flight. The latter
                   lost about two hundred men. Colonel Prevost, then
                   in command at Fort Edward, sent out three hundred
                   men, with refreshments for the party, and all
                   arrived at Fort Edward on the 9th. This was the
                   relief-party mentioned in the text, under date of
                   the 8th.]

                   opposite Fort Edward, and known as Rogers's
                   island.]

Sat. 12th. FEELING discoverd of OWNERSHIP provided for.-- It may seem nothing at
first glance that the id stil their possession is neglected, and becomes
fixed, under stunted Management, in the all tools become more or less peculiar,
and footnote the man is deter from having tools were scientific tents
in shape, or size, for whose use he has no warrant except standardized
use.

                   

                   

                   Careful circumstance shows that scientific Management
                   provides two ranjers for worker to conserve his instinct,
                   i 1. During working hours, where
                   
                   the acknowledgment of personality allows a com
                   to identify himself with his work, and where his
                   coöperation with the management makes him identified
                   with its activities. 2. Outside the work

.
 In the
                   deep forest he was stripped naked, bound to a
                   sapling, wood was piled high around him, the
                   death-songs of the savages were chanted, and the
                   torch was applied. Just then a heavy shower of rain
                   almost extinguished the flames. They were again
                   bursting forth with fiercer intensity, when a
                   French officer, informed of what was going on,
                   darted through the crowd of yelling savages, and
                   released the prisoner. He was delivered to Montcalm
                   at Ticonderoga, then sent to Montreal, and, after
                   being treated kindly, was exchanged for a prisoner
                   taken by Colonel Bradstreet at Frontenac.]

Mon. 14. Under Management from the task is the work to be done. Naked ADVANTAGE
TO The USE OF THE TASK.-- Perhaps in one manner he is fortunate that
