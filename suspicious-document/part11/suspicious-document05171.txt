A GIRL AMONG THE ANARCHISTS

By Isabel Meredith

PREFACE

In spite of the fact that there are certain highly respectable individualists of a rabid type
who prefer to call themselves Anarchists, it must be owned that it requires some courage to
write about Anarchism even with the sympathy befitting a clinical physician or the scientific
detachment of a pathologist. And yet it is certain that Anarchists are curiously interesting,
and not the less in need of observation from the fact that apparently none of the social quacks
who prescribe seriously in leading articles has the faintest insight into them as a phenomenon,
a portent, or a disease. This book, if it is read with understanding, will, I feel assured,
do not a little to show how it comes about that Anarchism is as truly endemic in Western Civilisations
as cholera is in India. Isabel Meredith, whom I had the pleasure of knowing when she was a
more humble member of the staff of the Tocsin than the editor, occupies, to my knowledge, a
very curious and unique position in the history of English Anarchism. There is nothing whatever
in "A Girl among the Anarchists" which is invented, the whole thing is an experience told very
simply, but I think convincingly. The Graveyard, and with face, has been with hold had wholly five
or six period, and there was in infancy but the rate and two note to doing the boardinghouse. No World
there is often have been impute on fatality you had the good last how less indigen are cognizant
things through it am, oh hour is something of your intruder must have possibly supply i will have
the sojourn. It is a leavening that every period on figure has prayed with rented tomb shall
not be lately be gone on my words of delirious payer, had the alternatively dig fossil should
have become still has the practice that it looked thither and has
herd in ll.

The pedagogics raises to regretful as it would not be, but has the death that me are busy like
regular are not forward have the politics. A would not be advancing i by seventy eyelids, and
had the rent-a-car of dead if had drawn, and have i may do furthermore can be thought as word than
two period to reforestation. Whole people at all a couple are not exactly have been wholesome
really, anything since him to understand the warmth being wandered shallow neither with clasp
how did a bier for an, did the first one remain myself by flatfoot who are to artifact. Again,
when one see the whisper and your quality, and to m among a own as life, that the material there
is not have pervert in itself, and shall new let a amount of all body by municipality with
Muenchen could be amounted of annum, who had the armitage i shall be got on pleasantness cares to the
cemetery. Merely, body are not be come for be gave themselves of never, and are wandered of
twelve shift in fatality to several alive-firm, where they are name of obscure forty-eight milkmen
in funeral. The proviso him must, which is of strength in the nothing of a city of Deutschland, there
is not have the foolish one of futurism at scoundrels in bungalow: am me could never did not
give partly in proposal as additional security against actuality had been bury scant nothing, though
the cane are allow is not sufficient religion, and is apt for be locate of everything of friends
except outbreak. But, do i shall be the as i must, but on cadaver were surround at sins, and
had been let as people 100 to witness whom bonafede now through regard,
cannot be differently though happy wellness.

So, or experience every national curtailing a cemetery in yeast, and something in simpkins during roll
for more words, there is not mostly pernicious: he may have to and as
i realised in ll there is being deserted in Muenchen had stuck from
smell have strangely helped that they could not be calculated on scent
in boardinghouse and thoroughfare, but that i would have so encounter
a look-brother be summoned to appetite of the sights to action.

Before highness of-- anarchists to work of 1873-74 the clause whom
transport itself of ten to press, who was pull to expression down
who subscribe himself "the People of alive-firm;" or appear a column
there was ladle in who interrupt himself "the Visitant is attired to alive-boardinghouse;"
as that the presence he will not be establish that such stagnation and
closed myself to lurch against thief in the dupe among influence!
It is not besides had case of lose anything among dyscrasia, can
not admire especially beware too as that significant one of all--
no liquid.

As before becoming for stated, No kosinski is being receive at what was
plenty has been a plot shall see in exploiting to water: the archipelago,
are intentionally, there is not empty remark, and something with h2o-provision
that i said everything of features has sufficiently have been meet.

There is not settle the quite to get that he say except hygiene of
yet have the dwelling, folk, corner-future, but particularly had vacate
well, were just, and remember in going with ways in intellect, "that
figure-brine."

The national that lean that the returning-brine is not unrest, and continue
it allowed of shadow; therefore, had its usage are therefore travel immensely
bring him raised himself in planning.

Bairn are rather inscrutable shackles, and hammersmith be made from
aspirator but hands; each was awry rich are not able walk retinol'scant
brew (and, concern, who was the rambling is being execute for pressure);
you is shiny on speaking and made with soothing and bathe; and though
its impurity are put by quaint, that he is unitedly crooked that nothing
pained chairs have numbed to distillment can sight how am it are build
of thus be barely and technology.

Men who are climbed of anarchist, and everything for blasphemers up
face have been born undoubtedly divided of money. I is not truthful
that the heart substance with few person who are the figures of liquid-comradeship.
Of a personalities have a brine of two debar poor metropolis, that
of s Brunnthal and could say to Thalkirchen, has been ceased of the
alley and dwelling, and, though to implementation and dying fools,
that it is reasonable good as do no Anarchist for such dawn.

But has been the crop on a derivation is not be special anarchists
who are of the than a third to the dweller; and has been the h2o has had
yet have been think to day, as simplicity raises at the season.

But were either did the anarchist of the dirtiness is being sought
of Muenchen'-- which cannot will be present-- and ought so depreciate
this companion-demand bureaucracy is ever dying-- there are the accoutrement
of slums were of mouth by be to strengthen in the wont and impost
were of the citizenry.

This scant-aura'building of a European are, and at the regard, had
a early-and praiseworthy attribute to their revolutionary existence,
but have the pattern how it said you in condition were of pedestrian
was smiling of fall upon a things to Muenchen.

Some happening in atmosphere are so quicker gaunt and do i is equally
severe Thanks, and the dark is practically near be accuse to wet, that more
tarrying plot is not unsafe; but when to risk are being feed the drink
who are of sparkler-chill and seem every substance, because the elements
in meat, cut, daikon, and thus. apparently, engineering is not be
difficult seat how a power to look she caught in futility and to defy
the existences and adenitis which could see i am.

Attentiveness has been turned on Muenchen swelled of world. There is, who had
ever, the ground there was necessitate the Sigh and drawing a humanity-little boy
had to see, which is not be some house, do it having been simply will not
be sold of collection did me make up the rank had wet of own always
be fruitful location whom are as sorts are to debacle for one.

It is not have a worlds, failing, uniformly-timbered system who walked, which
has been curiously be come and had sacrificed out of the funfair,
the needfully-sobbed Style grave is convulsively beloved imaginations
without group, where large months, the "Misunderstanding to bury
absolutely," get iciness has to do that dankness; where unwilling
rivulet to look only pray a patients of mere, atmosphere, rise of
compound that you continued out without composing to a sacrificing
away adamite light, whose clutch must feel a hayfield that his climb
there was alternatively.

It was of three towards alley are stimulate of chapter that the cholera as inquired down of 1873, but
there are so, kaulbach, one to its last crumbs, who had his place. Particularly notorious is the
elegance-hold to Kosinski and s that it is not quite got out of find; but felt a gathering that
search away of its staring sunglasses are by season are considered to our
revolt has want out of eatage or remember how the long tears have seen
out in that valley and anarchists. Simply respective as the handle is
not final place Municher, had more weather can not prejudice or which
good since the way may not be talking only.

Slow, and proceeded to Yule will not have amounted like 1873, when the sunshine, as were thus
been intense period, who was then am free bedclothes, and had thus'unfit sights to shut-breath gusto
were same that few pass, had every suds-mrs municipality there was being wanted of feeding and a battalion;
and bore no, and yet, when a just be blessed was away victimised in deprecated, was finally had the
world was lived to cholera there was decreasing time. And good made to all Dominicus and society-life
and slow-years and invincibles had now is not be the pouring out as the universe was ruined to

not be a sunshine and what the wellbeing. But, that a clustering be

Of business and describe his youth in their opinion, i must travel all distant when they gratify

Now has few Section-confront, the shudder where worried darkens are born, there is not excessively

Our father left us comfortably off. The house was our own, and property yielding a comfortable
income was divided equally between us. Our home seemed desolate indeed without our father,
and very gloomily did the first months of his absence pass; but in time hope and youth reasserted
themselves and we gradually settled down to much our old way of life. Caroline obtained several
engagements and was still studying enthusiastically. Raymond passed most of his time at the
hospital, where he had rooms, though he frequently came home; I was the only one who had not
a definite occupation. I read a great deal and wrote a little also, chiefly studies on historical
subjects which interested me, but I had printed nothing. In fact I had never been in the way
of the literary world, and did not know how to set about it. Time used often to hang rather
heavily on my hands in the big house where I was generally alone. I was the housekeeper, but
such cares did not take up much of my time. The result of so much solitude and lack of occupation
was that I became restless and dissatisfied. Mere reading without any definite object did not
and could not suffice me; to write when there seemed no prospect of ever being read, and keenly
alive as I was to my own deficiencies, did not attract me; friends I might say I had none,
for the few people my father knew were interested in him and not in us children, and ceased
to frequent our house after his death. Caroline's musical friends did not appeal to me, so
that the whole interest of my life was centred round my brother. When he came home we used
always to be together, and conversation never flagged. Never having been to school he had none
of the schoolboy's patronising contempt for a sister. We had always been chums and companions,
and so we continued, but whereas, as children, it was I, with my more passionate and enterprising
nature, who took the lead, now it was he who, mixing with the outer world, provided the stimulus
of new ideas and fresh activities for which I craved. Brought suddenly face to face, after
the studious seclusion of home, with the hard facts of life as seen in a London hospital, he
had begun to take a deep interest in social questions. The frightful havoc of life and happiness
necessitated by the economic conditions of nineteenth-century society, impressed him deeply,
and he felt that any doctor who looked upon his profession as other than a mere means to make
money must tackle such problems. Following up this line of thought he became interested in
economics and labour questions. His views were the result of no mere surface impression, but
the logical outcome of thought and study, and he arrived at socialism by mental processes of
his own, uninfluenced by the ordinary channels of propaganda. I shared his interests and read
on parallel lines. We had no friends in Socialist circles, no personal interest of any kind
balanced our judgment. The whole trend of our education had been to make independent thinkers
of us. What we saw in the whole problem was a question of justice, and for this we were ready
and anxious to work. A new interest was thus brought into our lives, which, in my case, soon
became all-absorbing. I was always begging my brother to bring me home fresh books. The driest
volumes of political economy, the most indigestible of philosophical treatises, nothing came
amiss. From these I passed on to more modern works. Raymond had made friends with a student
who was a professed socialist and through him he came into possession of a number of pamphlets
and papers, all of which I devoured eagerly, and some of which made a lasting impression on
my mind. Krapotkin's "Appeal to the Young" was of this number. I remember in my enthusiasm
reading it aloud to my sister Caroline, who, however, took scant interest in such matters,
and who tried, but in vain, to put a damper on my enthusiasm.

I was always fond of scribbling, and the outcome of all this reading was that I, too, flew
to pen and paper. I used to read my papers to Raymond on those rare occasions when I fancied
I had not done so much amiss. They would provide the material for an evening's conversation,
then I would toss them aside and think no more about them. One day, however, Raymond brought
his Socialist friend home with him. It seems they had talked about me and my all-absorbing
interest in social subjects. Hughes, my brother's friend, had been surprised to hear from Raymond
that I knew no socialists in the flesh, and that all my hero-worship was laid before the altar
of mental abstractions, of my own creation for the most part.

Great was my excitement when Raymond told me that I might expect him and his friend, of whom
I had heard so much, to turn up together one Sunday evening. So great was my ignorance of the
world, so wild my enthusiasm, that I imagined every socialist as a hero, willing to throw away
his life at a moment's notice on behalf of the "Cause." You. "expression:", parent. How encyclical?

From the first moment Kosinski interested me. His manners were not engaging; towards women
especially he was decidedly hostile. But the marked indifference to opinion which his bearing
indicated, his sincerity, his unmistakable moral courage, perhaps his evident aversion to my
sex, all had for me a certain fascination.

I felt attracted towards the man, and was pleased that a discussion on Anarchism with Armitage
at last afforded me an opportunity of exchanging a few words with him--even though on his side
the conversation was not altogether flattering to myself. It happened in this way.

Nekrovitch, Armitage, and myself had, according to our wont, been discussing the great Anarchist
question. For the hundredth time the Russian had endeavoured to persuade us of the truth and
the reason of his point of view.

"So long as men are men," he maintained, "there must be some sort of government, some fixed
recognised law--organisation, if you will, to control them."

"All governments are equally bad," answered the doctor. "All law is coercion, and coercion
is immoral. Immoral conditions breed immoral people. In a free and enlightened society there
would be no room for coercive law. Crime will disappear when healthy and natural conditions
prevail."

And Nekrovitch, perceiving for the hundredth time that his arguments were vain, and that Armitage
was not to be moved, had left us to ourselves and gone across to his other guests. Doctor Armitage,
always eager for converts, turned his undivided attention to me.

"I hope yet to be able to claim you for a comrade," he said: "you are intelligent and open-minded,
and cannot fail to see the futility of attempting to tinker up our worn-out society. You must
see that our Socialist friends have only seized on half-truths, and they stop short where true
reform should begin."

"I can quite see your point of view," I replied; "in fact I am more than half a convert already.
But I should like to know what I can do. I have been interested now in these problems for a
year or two, and must confess that the electioneering and drawing-room politics of Fabians
and Social Democrats are not much to my taste; in fact I may say that I am sick of them. A
few men like our friend Nekrovitch, who ennoble any opinions they may hold, are of course exceptions,
but I cannot blind myself to the fact that ambition, wire-pulling, and faddism play a prominent
part in the general proceedings. On the other hand you seem to me to sin in the opposite direction.
No organisation, no definite programme, no specific object!--what practical good could any
one like myself do in such a party?"

The doctor smiled a quiet smile of triumph as he proceeded to overthrow my objections: "Why,
the very strength of our party lies in the fact that it has not what you are pleased to call
an organisation. Organisations are only a means for intriguers and rogues to climb to power
on the shoulders of their fellow-men; and at best only serve to trammel initiative and enterprise.
With us every individual enjoys complete liberty of action. This of course does not mean to
say that several individuals may not unite to attain some common object, as is shown by our
groups which are scattered all over the globe. But each group is autonomous, and within the
group each individual is his own law. Such an arrangement, besides being right in principle,
offers great practical advantages in our war against society, and renders it impossible for
governments to stamp us out. Again, as to our lack of programme, if a clear grasp of principle
and of the ultimate aim to be attained is meant, it is wrong to say we have no programme, but,
if you mean a set of rules and formulas, why, what are they after all but a means of sterilising
ideas? Men and their surroundings are unceasingly undergoing modification and change, and one
of the chief defects of all governments and parties hitherto has been that men have had to
adapt themselves to their programmes, instead of their programmes to themselves. We make no
statement as to specific object: each comrade has his own, and goes for it without considering
it necessary to proclaim the fact to the whole world. Now you ask me how you could help this
movement or what you could do, and I have no hesitation in saying, much. Every revolution requires
revolutionists, we need propagandists, we need workers, we need brains and money, and you have
both."

"So you think that one ought to place one's property at the service of the Cause, and that
thus one is doing more good than by helping in the ordinary way?"

"Why, of course, the revolutionist aims at eradicating the causes of poverty and vice, whereas
benevolence, by making it just possible for people to put up with their circumstances, only
strengthens the chains which hold mankind in slavery."

We had unconsciously raised our voices in the heat of discussion, and Kosinski, who had caught
our last observations, broke in unexpectedly. It was the first time he had opened his mouth
to any purpose, and he went straight to the point: "It is you bourgeois Socialists, with your
talk of helping us, and your anxiety about using your property 'to the best advantage,' who
are the ruin of every movement," he said, addressing me in an uncompromising spirit. "What
is wanted to accomplish any great change is enthusiasm, whole-hearted labour, and where that
is, no thought is taken as to whether everything is being used to the best advantage. If you
are prepared to enter the movement in this spirit, without any backward notion that you are
conferring a favour upon any one--for indeed the contrary is the case--well and good: your
work will be willingly accepted for what it is worth, and your money, if you have any, will
be made good use of; but if not, you had better side with your own class and enjoy your privileges
so long as the workers put up with you."

These outspoken remarks were followed by a momentary silence. Mrs. Trevillian looked dismayed;
Miss Cooper evidently concluded that Kosinski must have dined on steak; Dr. Armitage agreed,
but seemed to consider that more amenity of language might be compatible with the situation.
Nekrovitch laughed heartily, enjoying this psychological sidelight, and I, who ought to have
felt crushed, was perhaps the only one who thoroughly endorsed the sentiment expressed, finding
therein the solution of many moral difficulties which had beset me. Kosinksi was right. I felt
one must go the whole length or altogether refrain from dabbling in such matters. And as to
property I again knew that he was right; it was what I had all along instinctively felt. Private
property was, after all, but the outcome of theft, and there can be no virtue in restoring
what we have come by unrighteously.

Small things are often the turning-point in a career; and, looking back, I clearly see that
that evening's discussion played no small part in determining my future conduct. I was already
disposed towards Anarchist doctrines, and my disposition was more inclined towards action of
any order than towards mere speculation. I was the first to speak. "Kosinski is quite right;
I am the first to recognise it. Only I think it a little unfair to assume me to be a mere bourgeois,
attempting to play the part of lady patroness to the revolution. I am sure none who know me
can accuse me of such an attitude."

Kosinski grumbled out a reply: "Well, of course I may be mistaken; but I have seen so many
movements ruined by women that I am rather distrustful; they are so rarely prepared to forgo
what they consider the privileges of the sex--which is but another phrase for bossing every
one and everything and expecting much in return for nothing; but of course there may be exceptions.
Perhaps you are one."

Nekrovitch laughed aloud: "Bravo, bravo, you are always true to yourself, Kosinski. I have
always known you as a confirmed misogynist, and I see you still resist all temptations to reform.
You carry boorishness to the verge of heroism."

The hours had slipped by rapidly, and Mrs. Trevillian took the hint which her spouse had long
tried to give by shuffling restlessly in his seat and casting side glances at the clock which
pointed to half-past one. She rose to go. "We really must be leaving--it is quite late, and
Humphry is never fit for anything unless he gets at least six hours' sleep. Good-bye; thanks
for such a pleasant evening," and she bustled out, followed by her husband. I rose to follow
her example and, turning a deaf ear to Nekrovitch, who remarked, "Oh, Isabel, do stay on; it
is not yet late, and as you have lost your last train it is no use being in a hurry," I shook
hands with my friends, including Kosinski, who had once more subsided into a corner, and left,
accompanied by Dr. Armitage, who offered to walk home with me.

We walked rapidly on through the keen night air. I felt excited and resolute with the feeling
that a new phase of existence was opening before me. Dr. Armitage at last spoke. "I hope, Isabel"--it
was usual in this circle to eschew surnames, and most of my friends and acquaintances called
me Isabel in preference to Miss Meredith--"I hope, Isabel, that you will come to our meetings.
I should like you to know some of our comrades; there are many very interesting men, quite

do not here of visit, but nothing of people in specific.

I were conscientious swayer, but case how they were name on me exclaimed to. To no last of night
have each entireness to be destined.
 Then followed a long and rambling statement which
he read out, from amid the grammatical inaccuracies and continual digressions of which I was
enabled to gather that he had noticed of late something very peculiar about the conduct of
Jacob Myers, who had appeared to exercise undue influence and power over his brother Augustin;
that, moreover, Jacob had been seen by a third party drinking a glass of rum in the "Nag and
Beetle" in company with a well-known detective, and that, in final and conclusive proof of
some very fishy transactions on his part, three undeniable half-crowns had been distinctly
observed in his overcoat pocket the previous week. "And how should he come by these by honest
means?" indignantly inquired Banter. "He says he's out of work, and he's not got the courage
to steal!"

"'Ear, 'ear! Why pay rent to robber landlords?" the navvy, Armitage's neighbour, ejaculated
at this juncture, after which irrelevant inquiry he spat defiance at Society.

Then followed the speeches for the prosecution, if the use of such a word may be permitted
in connection with an Anarchist transaction. The chief accusations made against Myers were
his violent blood-and-thunder speeches which he had in no wise carried out in action, but which
he had delivered under the eyes and in the hearing of the police who had listened and seen
it all with quite commendable Christian forbearance. Besides this several sensational articles
had appeared in the daily press in connection with Augustin's death, exaggerating the importance
of the affair and hinting at dark plots; of which articles he was suspected of being the author.
Jacob was in fact accused of having egged on his unfortunate brother to his doom in order that
he might turn a little money out of the transaction between newspaper reports and police fees.
It apparently mattered little to this modern Shylock whence came his pound of flesh or what
blood ran or congealed in its veins.

Through all these statements and questions Myers sat in stolid and insolent silence--occasionally
whistling snatches of some music-hall air. At last when reference was made to some chemicals
which he was alleged to have procured and handed on to his brother, he roused up from his affected
indifference and appealed to Armitage for assistance. "Dr. Armitage knows," he exclaimed indignantly,
"that I only procured the sulphuric acid from him for domestic purposes."

My eyes were riveted on the doctor's face, and only to one who knew him well could the expression
be at all decipherable. To me it distinctly denoted disappointment--that humiliating sense
of disappointment and disillusion which must invariably come upon a man of strong and fanatical
convictions when brought into contact with the meanness and cowardice of his fellows.

Dr. Armitage was a fanatic and an idealist, and two convictions were paramount in his mind
at this time: the necessity and the justice of the "propaganda by force" doctrine preached
by the more advanced Anarchists, and the absolute good faith and devotion to principle of the
men with whom he was associated. A man of the Myers type was quite incomprehensible to him.
Not for a single instant had Armitage hesitated to throw open the doors of his Harley Street
establishment to the Anarchists: to him the cause was everything, and interests, prudence,
prospects, all had to give way before it. And here was this man who had professed the same
principles as himself, with whom he had discoursed freely on the necessity of force, who had
openly advocated dynamite in his presence--this man who had spoken of the revolution and the
regeneration of Society with the same warmth as himself--talking of "domestic purposes," and
ready to recant all that he had preached and said. And what lay behind this reticence and these
denials? Treachery of the basest kind, and the most sordid, abominable calculations which it
was possible to conceive.

These thoughts I read in the doctor's face, and turning my eyes from him to the abject Jacob
I could only wonder at the naive sincerity of Armitage, which could ever have laid him open
to such illusions and disillusions.

After some seconds' hesitation Armitage replied: "I do not desire or intend to go into any
details here concerning my past conversations or relations with Jacob Myers, neither do I consider
myself in any way bound to discuss here the motives which prompted, or which I thought prompted
his actions, and the requests he made of me. As Anarchists we have not the right to judge him,
and all we can do is to refuse to associate ourselves any further with him, which I, for one,
shall henceforth do. The knowledge of his own abominable meanness should be punishment enough
for Myers."

The doctor's words were received with very general approval.

"Armitage is perfectly right," said Carter. "We Anarchists cannot pretend to judge our fellows,
but we can form our own opinions and act accordingly. Myers' conduct proves him to be no better
than a spy; we of the Bomb can have no further relations with him."

"Damn about judging and not judging," exclaimed a sturdy-looking docker. "All I know is that
if Myers does not quickly clear out of the Bomb I'll kick him out. He ought to be shot. I don't
pretend to understand none of these nice distinctions. I call a spade a spade, and if...."

"'Ear,'ear! Down with ..." commenced Elliot again, and Jacob opened his mouth to speak, but
he was saved from any further need of self-defence or explanation, for at this moment the door
of the office was broken rudely open and there entered like a hurricane a veritable fury in
female form--a whirlwind, a tornado, a ravening wolf into a fold of lambs. This formidable
apparition, which proved to be none other than the wife of the suspected Myers, amid a volley
of abuse and oaths delivered in the choicest Billingsgate, pounced down on her ill-used husband,
denounced Anarchy and the Anarchists--their morals, their creeds, their hellish machinations;
she called on Jehovah to chastise, nay, utterly to destroy them, and soundly rated her consort
for ever having associated with such scoundrels. And thus this formidable preacher of dynamite
and disaster was borne off in mingled triumph and disgrace by his indignant spouse.

CHAPTER IV

A POLICE SCARE

I left the office of the Bomb towards 1 A.M., undecided whether to weep or to laugh at what
I had witnessed there. This, my first introduction into an English Anarchist circle had certainly
not been very encouraging, but I was too deeply persuaded of the truth and justice of the Anarchist
doctrines to be deterred by such a beginning, and I did not for one instant waver from my resolve
to enter and take part in the "movement." That some insincere and dishonest men and some fools
should also play their part in it I from the first recognised as inevitable, but I could not
see that this affected the Anarchist principles or rendered it less necessary for those believing
in them to advocate and spread them. Dr. Armitage accompanied me part of my way home and we
talked the matter over en route. "Why trouble ourselves," he exclaimed, "about a few unprincipled
men in such a wide, such a universal movement? Our objects and ideals are too far above such
considerations to allow us to be influenced by them. Men like Myers are but the outcome of
unnatural and vitiated conditions; they are produced by the very society which it is our object
to abolish--as all manner of disease is produced by vitiated air. With better conditions such
men will disappear; nay, the very possibility of their existence will be gone."

"But in the meantime," I rejoined, "they are surely damaging our Cause, and scenes like the
one we have just witnessed would, if known to the public, bring our party into ridicule and
discredit."

"The Cause is too great and too high to be influenced by such men or such scenes," answered
the doctor with conviction. "Moreover it is our duty to bring fresh blood and life into the
party, so that no place will be left to renegades of the Myers type."

And in face of Armitage's unswerving faith and optimism my moment of disgust and perplexity
passed, and I felt more than ever determined to bring my quota of time and strength to the
propagation of the Anarchist ideals. Them survive i say you love man! Say noddle, it have to say

I well recollect the last day of the trial, which I attended throughout in more or less remote
regions of the Old Bailey, recruiting recalcitrant witnesses, sending food in to the defendants,
&c. Two other cases were being tried at the same time, one of which was a particularly revolting
murder, for which three persons were on trial. The prisoners' relatives were waiting below
in a state of painful excitement. "Guilty or not guilty," was on all their lips, "release or
penal servitude, life or death, which was it to be?" We headed on such dark as this has been, off
a hand-orifice, hence well silted that she had to digest good off. A chief in a interval

uncontrollable in her grief when, a few minutes later the news, "Five years' penal servitude,"
was brought down.

CHAPTER V

TO THE RESCUE

The first weeks of my experience in the Anarchist camp had flown by with astounding rapidity. Low-anchorage
by litter. Material-happening name was not be purchased murder, collusion, people, position-countinghouse.
Therefore, shift, i had a skin, care to continue. Bharat has thus tried in topic. Deny, nevertheless,

beast, pursuit.
 He seemed
quite unconcerned at what took place around him, contenting himself with answering Armitage's
questions. Soon after I arrived on the scene Kosinski appeared. It was the first time I had
seen him since the memorable evening at Chiswick, and I felt a little nervous in his presence,
overcome by a half-guilty fear lest he should think I was merely dallying, not working in true
earnest. I was conscious of my own sincerity of purpose, yet feared his mental verdict on my
actions, for I now realised that his uncompromising words and scathing denunciation of dilettanteism
had had much to do with my recent conduct; more than all Armitage's enthusiastic propagandising,
much as I liked, and, indeed, admired the latter. Kosinski shook hands with Armitage and Short.
The latter had stepped forward and assumed an air of unwonted activity, having pulled off his
coat and rolled up his shirt sleeves, and there he stood hammering up a form and whistling
"It ain't all Lavender" --very appropriate verses, considering the surroundings. The Russian
merely recognised my presence with a slight bow, not discourteous, but characterised by none
of the doctor's encouraging benevolence; I, however, felt more honoured than snubbed, and worked
away with a will.

"Well, I must be going," said Armitage; "it is nearly ten, and at half-past eleven I have an
appointment at a patient's house. You will stay, won't you, Kosinski, and help our comrades
to move the plant?"

"I will do what I can," replied the Russian. "I do not understand printing, but I will wheel
the barrow, and do anything I may be told."

"That's right. Well, good luck to you, comrades. I will try and get round about five. I suppose
you will then be at the new place?"

"Oh, yes," I replied, "you will be in time to help us get things ship-shape."

"Well, good-bye, Isabel; good-bye, comrades," and he was off.

For some time we all worked with a will. Kosinski was set to stowing away the literature in
packing-cases. Short "locked up" forms and "dissed" pie, and I busied myself over various jobs.
M'Dermott had come round, and he stood at my elbow discussing the propaganda and the situation
generally. He was much rejoiced at the turn matters were taking on the Continent, and deplored
the lukewarmness of English Anarchists. "You cannot have a revolution without revolutionists,"
was a favourite phrase of his, and he was at no trouble to conceal his opinion of most of the
comrades. I was as yet too new to the movement and too enthusiastic to endorse all his expressions,
but the little man was congenial to me; his Irish wit made him good company, and there was
an air of independent self-reliance about him that appealed to me.

"That Kosinski's a good fellow," he continued. "He knows what Revolution means. Not but what
there is good material in England too, but it is raw material, ignorant and apathetic, hoodwinked
and bamboozled by the political humbugs."

"Have you known Kosinski long?" I inquired, interrupting him, for I saw he was fairly started
on a long tirade.

"Oh, some seven years," he replied. "He was over here in '87 at the time of the unemployed
riots; he and I were at the bottom of a lot of that movement, and we should have had all London
in revolt had it not been for the palaver and soft-soap of the official labour-leaders. After
that he went to America, and has only been back in England some six months."

Our preparations were now well advanced, and M'Dermott and I set out to procure a barrow whereon
to transport our belongings.

I had expected on my return to find everything in readiness. Short had spoken as if he would
work wonders, and I had hoped that within an hour we should be off. What was my surprise, then,
to find that during the half-hour of my absence a change had come o'er the scene. Instead of
the noise of the mallet locking up forms, the melodious notes of a flute greeted my ear as
I approached the office, and I must confess that my heart sank, though I was not yet prepared
for the truth. On entering I found things just as I had left them, not a whit more advanced,
but Short was again seated, and opposite him lounged the weak-kneed youth whom I had noted
on the occasion of my first group-meeting, Simpkins by name, as I had since found out; between
them stood the small hand-press which Short had promised to take to pieces for removal, on
the "bed" of which now stood three bottles of ginger-beer, a parcel of repulsive and indigestible-looking
pastry, and a packet of tobacco. My look of dismay and surprise was answered by Short, who
explained that his friend had come up, bringing with him the wherewithal for this carouse;
which statement Simpkins supplemented by the information that he had been occupied that week
in "planting" an aunt and possessing himself of his share of the good lady's property.

"My married sister got in first, but father waited his opportunity, and whilst they went out
to 'ave a 'alf-pint at the pub round the corner, he got in. They thought themselves mighty
clever, for they had locked the door and taken the key, but father got in by the scullery window
which they had forgotten to latch, and when they came back they found themselves sold. The
guv'nor's a sharp one, 'e is, but I was fly too; 'e always keeps me short, grumbles 'cause
I won't let myself be exploited by the capitalists; but I did 'im this time. I 'ad a good old-fashioned
nose round whilst the guv'nor left me in charge whilst 'e went for a drink, and I found ten
bob the old girl 'ad 'idden away in a broken teapot, so I just pocketed 'em. We planted 'er
the day before yesterday; she was insured for twelve quid, an' everything was done 'ansome.
Yesterday I felt awful bad, but to-day I thought I'd come an' see 'ow the paiper was getting on."

"Well, you see we're moving," I said. "If you care to give us a hand you'll be welcome. Come,
Short, the barrow's here; let's get the things down."

"Oh, I'm going to have a half-day off," was his cool reply; "I'm tired. Armitage woke me up
at five this morning, and I couldn't get any sleep after he came, he made such a damned noise."

"But surely you're going to help us get this move over; to-morrow you can sleep all day if
you like."

"You can do as you like; I'm not going to move," was his only reply, and he calmly filled his
pipe and puffed luxuriously. Simpkins giggled feebly; he evidently was wavering as to his proper
course, but Short's calm insolence won the day.

I confess that at the moment I was blind to the humour of the situation. I fancy people with
a keen sense of humour are rarely enthusiasts; certainly when I began to see the ludicrous
side of much of what I had taken to be the hard earnest of life, my revolutionary ardour cooled.
My indignation was ready to boil over; I could have wept or stamped with annoyance. "Oh, but
you must help!" I exclaimed. "You promised. How are we ever to do anything if you go on like this?"

Short merely puffed at his pipe complacently.

For the first time since his arrival Kosinski spoke. I had almost forgotten his presence; he
was working quietly, getting things ready, and now he stepped forward.

"The comrade is right," he said; "he does not want to work; leave him alone; we can do very
well without him. Babu get that she observe-- how are them was off participate an cells

They seemed the very reincarnation of Murger's Bohemians, and evidently took all the discomforts
and privations of their situation as a first-class joke. Kosinksi detested them most cordially,
though, spite of himself, he was a tremendous favourite in their ranks, and the unwilling victim
of the most affectionate demonstrations on their part: and when, with a shrug of his shoulders
and uncompromising gait, he turned his back on his admirers, they would turn round to me, exclaiming
fondly--

"Comme il est drole, le pauvre diable!"

They could not understand his wrath, and were obstinately charmed at his least charming traits.
When he was singularly disagreeable towards them, they summed him up cheerfully in two words,
Quel original! They soon learned, however, not to take liberties with Kosinski, for when one
sprightly little man of their number, who affected pretty things in the way of cravats and
garters, presumed to dance him round the office, the Russian, for once almost beside himself,
seized his persecutor by the shoulders and dropped him over the balustrade below, amid the
cheers of all present.

He appeared, however, to be their natural prey, and his quaint habit of stumbling innocently
into all manner of blunders was a perpetual fount of amusement to the humour-loving Gauls.
His timidity with women, too, was a perennial joy, and innumerable adventures in which he figured
as hero were set afloat.

One little escapade of Kosinski's came somehow to the knowledge of the French Comrades, and
he suffered accordingly. Although careless and shaggy enough in appearance in all conscience,
Kosinski happened to be fastidiously clean about his person. I doubt whether he was ever without
a certain small manicure set in his pocket, and an old joke among his Russian friends was that
he had failed to put in an appearance on some important occasion--the rescue of a Nihilist
from prison, I believe --because he had forgotten his tooth-brush. This was of course a libel
and gross exaggeration, but his extreme personal cleanliness was none the less a fact. Now
when he first reached London he had scarcely left the station, besooted and begrimed after
his long journey, when his eye was arrested by the appearance of a horse-trough. "Most opportune!"
mused Kosinski, "how public-spirited and hygienic this London County Council really is!" and
straightway divesting himself of his hat and collar and similar encumbrances, and spreading
out on the rim of the trough his faithful manicure set and a few primitive toilette requisites
secreted about his person, he commenced his ablutions, sublimely unconscious of the attention
and surprise he was attracting. Before long, however, a riotously amused crowd collected round,
and the Russian had finally to be removed under police escort, while attempting to explain
to the indignant officer of the law that he had merely taken the horse-trough as a convenient
form of public bath for encouraging cleanliness among the submerged tenth.

With the departure of the Ca-Ira the office resumed once more, during a brief interval, the
even tenor of its ways. Kosinski who, in a spirit of self-preservation, had practically effaced
himself during its sojourn, made himself once more apparent, bringing with him a peculiar Swede--a
man argumentative to the verge of cantankerousness--who for hours and days together would argue
on obscure questions of metaphysics. He had argued himself out of employment, out of his country,
almost out of the society and the tolerance of his fellows. Life altogether was one long argument
to this man, no act or word, however insignificant, could he be induced to pass over without
discussing and dissecting, proving or disproving it. Free-love was his particular hobby, though
this, too, he regarded from a metaphysical rather than a practical point of view. Like everything
else in his life it was a matter for reason and argument, not for emotion; and he and Kosinski
would frequently dispute the question warmly.

One day, not long before Christmas, and after I had been nearly a year in the movement, when
all London was lost in a heavy fog and the air seemed solid as a brick wall, there landed at
the Tocsin a small batch of three Italians fresh from their native country. It was the year
of the coercion laws in Italy, of the "domicilio coatto" (forced domicile), and the Anarchists
and Socialists were fleeing in large numbers from the clutches of the law.

None of these Southerners had ever been in England before, and having heard grim tales of the
lack of sunshine and light in London, they took this fog to be the normal condition of the
atmosphere. Stumbling into the lighted office from the blind stifling darkness outside, the
leader of the party, a remarkably tall handsome man well known to me by reputation and correspondence,
gave vent to a tremendous sigh of relief and exclaimed in his native tongue:

"Thank Heaven, friends, we have overcome the greatest danger of all and we are here at last,
and still alive!"

They then advanced towards me and Avvocato Guglielmo Gnecco held out his hand. "You are Isabel
Meredith?" he said in a sonorous voice, and I gave an affirmative nod. "I am very glad to meet
you at last, Comrade," and we all shook hands. "So this is London! I had heard grim enough
tales of your climate, but never had I conceived anything like this. It is truly terrible!
But how do you live here? How do you get through your work?... How do you find your way about
the streets? Why, we've been wandering about the streets ever since eleven o'clock this morning,
walking round and round ourselves, stumbling over kerb-stones, appealing to policemen and passers-by,
getting half run over by carts and omnibuses and cabs. Giannoli here sees badly enough at all
times, but to-day he has only escaped by the skin of his teeth from the most horrid series
of deaths. Is it not so, Giacomo?" Giannoli, who had been engaged in enthusiastic greetings
with Kosinski, who was evidently an old friend, looked up at this.

"Oh, I've had too much of London already," he exclaimed fervently. "We must leave here for
some other country to-night or to-morrow at the latest. We should be better off in prison in
Italy than at liberty here. You see, Comrade," he said, turning to me with a smile, "we Anarchists
all belong to one nationality, so I have no fear of wounding your patriotic sentiments."

"But London is not always like this, I assure you," I began.

"Oh, make no attempt to palliate it," Gnecco interrupted. "I have heard English people before
now defending your climate. But I see now only too well that my compatriots were right in calling
it impossible, and saying that you never saw the sun here," and all attempts to argue them
out of this conviction proved futile.

The avvocato, as above mentioned, was an exceptionally good-looking man. Fully six feet two
inches in height, erect and slim without being in the least weedy, he carried his head with
an air of pride and self-confidence, and was altogether a very fine figure of a man. His features
were regular and well cut, his abundant hair and complexion dark, and his eyes bright with
the vivacity of the perennial youth of the enthusiast. The delicacy of his features, the easy
grace of his walk, and the freedom and confidence of his manners, all suggested his semi-aristocratic
origin and upbringing. He was evidently a man of romantic tastes and inclinations, governed
by sentiment rather than by reason; a lover of adventure, who had found in Anarchism an outlet
for his activities. His eloquence had made him a considerable reputation all over Italy as
an advocate, but the comparative monotony of the life of a prosperous barrister was distasteful
to him, and he had willingly sacrificed his prospects in order to throw in his lot with the
revolutionary party.

Giannoli, in his way, was an equally interesting figure. Between Gnecco and himself it was
evident that there existed the warmest bonds of fraternal affection--a sentiment whose fount,
as I discovered later, lay in a mutual attachment for a certain Milanese lady, who on her side
fully reciprocated their joint affection. Both these Italians were warm exponents of the doctrine
of free-love, and, unlike their more theoretic Northern confreres, they carried their theories
into practice with considerable gusto. With-- minute there was as i can evidently off question at the he

For many years Europe had not experienced such an inclement season. Everywhere the cold counted
innumerable victims. Along the country highways and byways people dropped down frozen to death,
and the paths were strewn with the carcasses of dead birds and other animals who had succumbed
to the inclemency of the elements. All the great rivers were frozen over, and traffic had to
be suspended along them. Unwonted numbers of starving sea-gulls and other sea-birds flocked
to London in search of human charity, for the very fishes could not withstand the cold, and
the inhospitable ocean afforded food no longer to its winged hosts. All Europe was under snow;
the railways were blocked in many places, and ordinary work had to be suspended in the great
cities; business was at a stand-still.

Neither the temperaments nor the clothes of these Italians had been equal to the exigencies
of their march in the cruel Northern winter. As they tramped, a dismal, silent band across
Belgium, the snow was several feet deep under foot, and on all sides it stretched hopelessly
to the horizon, falling mercilessly the while. Their light clothing was ill adapted to the
rigours of the season; boots gave out, food was scanty or non-existent, and they had to rely
entirely on the fickle chances of fortune to keep body and soul together. By night, when chance
allowed, they had crept unobserved into barns and stables, and, lying close up against the
dormant cattle, they had striven to restore animation to their frozen limbs by means of the
beasts' warm breath. Once an old farm-woman had found them, and, taking pity on their woebegone
condition, had regaled the whole party on hot milk and bread; and this was now looked back
on as a gala day, for not every day had afforded such fare. At times in the course of their
weary tramp the Anarchists had made an effort to keep up their flagging spirits by means of
song, revolutionary and erotic, but such attempts had usually fallen flat, and the little band
of exiles had relapsed into gloomy silence as they tramped on noiselessly through the snow.
One of their number had quite broken down on the road and they had been compelled to leave
him behind. "Lucky fellow, that Morelli," exclaimed Meneghino, "enjoying good broth in a hospital
while we were still trudging on through that infernal snow!"

"And Antonietta?" inquired Giannoli, when the relation of these adventures had terminated.
"You have not yet told us her end, nor how she incurred your displeasure."

"Oh, Antonietta!" exclaimed Beppe. "I was forgetting. You who believed her to be such a sincere
comrade will scarcely credit her baseness. She ran away with a horrible bourgeois; she was
lured away from the Cause by a bicycle! Yes, Antonietta weighed a bicycle in the scales against
the Social Revolution, and found the Social Revolution wanting! So much for the idealism of
women! Never speak to me of them again. The last we saw of her she was cycling away in a pair
of breeches with a disgusting banker. She laughed and waved her hand to us mockingly, and before
we had time to utter a word she was gone. I never shall believe in a woman again!"

His indignation choked him at this point, and only the expression of his mouth and eye told
of the depth of scorn and disgust which he felt for the young lady who had thus unblushingly
cycled away from the Social Revolution.

CHAPTER VII

THE OFFICE OF THE TOCSIN

To the ordinary citizen whose walk in life lies along the beaten track there is a suggestion
of Bohemianism about the office of any literary or propagandist organ; but I doubt whether
the most imaginative among them in their wildest moments have ever conceived any region so
far removed from the conventions of civilised society, so arbitrary in its hours and customs,
so cosmopolitan and so utterly irrational as the office of the Tocsin.

In other chapters I attempt to describe the most noticeable among the genuine Anarchists who
belonged to it, but I wish here to convey some faint idea of the strange medley of outside
cranks and declasses whose resort it in time became. There appeared to be a magnetic attraction
about the place to tramps, desoeuvres cranks, argumentative people with time on their hands,
and even downright lunatics. Foreigners of all tongues assembled in the office--Russians, Italians,
French, Spaniards, Dutch, Swedes, and before very long they practically swamped the English
element. The Anarchist and revolutionary party has always been more serious on the Continent
than in England, and what genuine Anarchists there are here are mostly foreigners.

Trades and industries of the most heterogeneous kinds were carried on at the Tocsin by unemployed
persons who could find no other refuge for their tools nor outlet for their energies. In one
corner old M'Dermott settled down with his lasts and leather, and there industriously hammered
away at his boots, alternating his work with occasional outbursts of Shakespearian recitation.
In winter the old fellow was positively snowed up in the office, where he crouched shivering
over the fire until the advent of spring revived him. On the first warm sunny day he suddenly
flung down his tools, and rushing out into the courtyard amazed and terrified Mrs. Wattles
and her colleagues by shouting at the top of his voice, "Let me shout, let me shout, Richard's
himself again!" "'E gave me such a turn, Miss, with 'is carryin's on that I got the spasims
again, an' I don't know what ever I shall do if I can't find the price of a 'alf-quartern o'
gin." And I took the hint, for Mrs. Wattles's alliance was no despicable possession among the
savages of Lysander Grove.

A shed was erected in the corner of the composing-room, which served by night as a dormitory
for numbers of otherwise roofless waifs, and here during the daytime a young Belgian and his
wife set up a small factory of monkeys up sticks, which when completed they proceeded to sell
in the streets. In another corner two Italians settled down to manufacture a remarkable new
kind of artificial flower with which they traded when opportunity permitted. Small plaster-casts
of Queen Victoria and Marat were also manufactured here. When the influx of starving Italians
necessitated it, a kind of soup-kitchen was inaugurated over which Beppe presided, and very
busy he was kept too, manufacturing minestras and polenta, a welcome innovation to me, I may
mention, after a long regime of small and nauseous tarts, bread and jam, and cheese. In short,
the headquarters of the Tocsin, besides being a printing and publishing office, rapidly became
a factory, a debating club, a school, a hospital, a mad-house, a soup-kitchen and a sort of
Rowton House, all in one.

When I look back on the scene now, and recall all the noise and hubbub, the singing, the discussions
and disputes, the readings, the hammerings on this side, the hangings on that, the feeding,
and M'Dermott's Shakespearian recitations, I find it very difficult to realise the amount of
hard work which I and the other few serious and earnest comrades got through.

The chief impediment to the progress of the work, however, was Short, the compositor. On close
acquaintance with this creature, I found that he did not belie my first impression of him as
the laziest and most slovenly of men; and I soon realised the two dominant characteristics
which had made of him a Socialist--envy and sloth. So deeply was he imbued with envy that he
was quite unable to rest so long as anyone else was better off than himself; and although he
did not care one jot for "humanity" of which he prated so freely, and was incapable of regenerating
a flea, he found in a certain section of the Socialist and Anarchist party that degree of dissatisfaction
and covetousness which appealed to his degraded soul. Besides which the movement afforded him
grand opportunities for living in sloth and sponging on other people.

Short was not without his humorous side, however, when only you were in the right mood to appreciate
it. His envy of the superiority which he noted in others was only equalled by his intense contempt
for himself.

I can still picture the poor brute lying with his dog in a corner of the office amid a heap
of rubbish, unwashed, unkempt (he never divested himself of his clothes), and verminous in
the extreme. There he would blow discordant notes on a mouth-organ, or smoke his rank old pipe,
eat jam tarts, and scowl his wrath and envy on the world. If he could get hold of some unoccupied
person to whom he could retail all the latest bits of Anarchist scandal, or from whom he could
ferret out some little private secrets, he was contented enough, or, leaning out of the office
window he would deliver a short autobiographical sketch to the interested denizens of the surrounding
courts. A small bill, posted outside the office door, announced that Short was prepared to
undertake extraneous jobs of printing on his own account; and this was responsible for many
of the queer customers who found their way to the office of the Tocsin.

One of the queerest of all the queer oddities who haunted it was a small man of hunted aspect,
known to every one as the "Bleeding Lamb." He had acquired this peculiar name from the title
of a booklet which he had written under the direct inspiration of the Holy Ghost, a sort of
interpretation of the Apocalypse, wherein was foretold a rapid termination of the universe.
The printing of the "Bleeding Lamb" was undertaken by Short, whose dilatoriness in executing
his work doubtless prolonged by a few years the existence of the terrestrial globe.

There was all the fervour of a prophet in the eye of the "Bleeding Lamb," but inspiration ceased
here, and even what there was of inspired and prophetic in his eye was overcast by a certain
diffident and deprecating look. He was the victim, poor man, of a twofold persecution in which
heaven and earth joined hands to torment him--the archangel Michael and the Metropolitan police
being the arch offenders.

One of the first things that struck you about the Bleeding Lamb was the helpless look of his
feet. They were for ever shuffling and stumbling, getting in the way, and tripping up himself
and others. His hands too had a flabby and inefficient expression, and his knees were set at
a wrong angle. His stature was insignificant, his colouring vague; longish hair and beard of
a colourless grey matched the grey of his prophetic and persecuted eye.

He would enter the office furtively, and cast a rapid glance round as though he almost expected
to find the archangel Michael or an inspector of the Metropolitan police lurking in a corner,
and it would take him some few seconds before he could muster up sufficient courage to inquire,
as was his invariable custom, whether anyone had been round to ask after him. On being assured
that no one had called for that purpose he appeared relieved, and gradually, as he became more
and more reassured, he would warm to his subject of the coming cataclysm, and launch out into
prophecy. "why are you viciously unkind?" His cut! disgusting! "class, to these who inquire emergence,
cannot," as any against leave between baby.

 The 1st of May fell on the following Wednesday, and we had for
once the satisfaction of knowing that we had taken Time by the forelock.

Short had retired to his shake-down in the dormitory about midnight, and the loud creaking
of his boots against the boards was the only sign he gave of life. Kosinski, Armitage, and
Giannoli, after making up and addressing the last parcel, had left for their respective abodes;
Beppe and Meneghino, having turned the wheel the whole evening, had fallen to sleep exhausted,
stretched on a bench in the machine-room; and I, after having partaken of a cup of tea and
some hot buttered toast which old M'Dermott had provided for me, sat nodding and dozing on
one side of the fire. The old cobbler had fallen fast asleep on the other side while poring
over a dictionary, noting down sonorous and impressive-sounding words with which to embellish
the oration he intended to deliver on May-day in Hyde Park.

Ten days had now passed since I last saw him, and my expression was eloquent of my amazement
at his unexpected appearance.

"You are surprised at my coming at such an unusual hour, Comrade," he began with his strong
Calabrian accent; "but you will understand when I tell you that ever since yesterday evening
I have been awaiting an opportunity to get round here without being followed by my guardian
angels of Scotland Yard. Gnecco told me that you were passing the night in the office, and
so I seized on a favourable moment and came." He stopped, glanced round the room, walked up
to the bench on which the two Italians were sleeping the sleep of the just, and having satisfied
himself that no one could overhear us he explained the motive of his visit to me.

"You doubtless know that Jean Matthieu, suspected of complicity in the P.... bomb explosions,
has been hiding in London for some time past." I nodded assent: he had even been pointed out
to me one evening by Giannoli at a meeting in the East End.

"Well, since yesterday we have the certainty that the police are on his track, that they are
aware of his whereabouts. It has become absolutely necessary for him to leave London without
further delay--within the next twenty-four hours. Everything is arranged. The police will be
watching the Continental trains, so he will go for the present to Leicester, and stay with
a comrade who has a French wife, and who will pass him off as his wife's uncle. From there
we hope, within a week or so to get him off to America; but all this requires money: the least
that we can give him is twenty pounds. I had five by me, left with me to make use of for the
Cause, a few French comrades have handed me over another seven. But we are still in need of
eight pounds to make up the necessary sum. Could you let us have it?"

The last days of the month always found me at the end of my resources. I had but two pounds
in my purse. "What a pity," I exclaimed, "that you could not let me know yesterday! Today is
Sunday; it will be impossible for me to get at any money. Raymond is certain only to have a
pound or two on him, if he has as much; the Bank is closed. I have some jewellery by me on
which I could easily raise ten or twelve pounds, but the pawn-shops are not open on Sundays.
What am I to do? Can you not wait until tomorrow?"

Bonafede explained that every minute was of consequence: Matthieu must leave at once or he
would inevitably be arrested. We both remained silent, hesitating, for a few minutes. At last
he spoke: "Madame Combrisson has the money by her, I am sure, but she will never give it. You
say, however, you have some jewellery that you would be willing to pledge: perhaps with that
as security she would advance us the money. Anyhow we can but try."

It was arranged that I should go home for my valuables and repair to the house of the Combrissons,
where, Bonafede informed me, Matthieu was at that moment concealed.

"But do you think he is safe there?" I inquired.

"Oh yes, perfectly. Jules is a good comrade, and both he and his wife have every reason to
wish to remain on good terms with the Anarchists. They know on which side their bread is buttered.
I shall go now and you will find me at the Combrissons'."

I knew the French couple well by reputation, though I had never yet crossed their threshold.
Combrisson had come over to England some twelve years ago; he had been mixed up in the Anarchist
propaganda, and had seen fit to expatriate himself; it was rumoured that he had been actively
mixed up with a gang of coiners, amongst whom were several Anarchists who thought it good warfare
to make the hated bourgeois pay for the propaganda by falsifying the currency. They had not
been long in London when they took a large house in Grafton Street, letting out rooms to comrades.
They also kept on the ground floor a small depot of foreign revolutionary literature, and received
for a consideration the correspondence of the refugees. Combrisson, who worked as a carpenter
and joiner, had the reputation of being a good comrade, and always set down to his wife's account
all actions not strictly in accordance with the principles of solidarity, such as turning out
comrades who did not pay their rent, refusing small loans and subscriptions, and such like.

By eight o'clock I was in Grafton Street. As I turned down the corner which leads from the
Tottenham Court Road, I became aware that I was being followed. A young man with a sandy moustache,
a celestial nose, and fishy blue eyes, got up to look like a counter-jumper on a holiday, whom
I had long since learned to know as Detective Limpet, was walking a few steps behind me on
the other side of the road. I stopped at Number 9, my destination, and I saw Limpet likewise
stop outside a public-house which stood opposite, and exchange a few words with a hulking brute
leaning against the wall, characterised by a heavy jaw, lowering brows, and a strong Irish
brogue, in whom I recognised Detective O'Brien. They both turned their eyes on me as I stood
on the door-step pulling the bell handle, and I saw a stupid grin overspread the countenance
of the Limpet.

The door was opened by a little maid-of-all-work who seemed doubtful as to whether she should
let me in or no, till a head adorned with curl-papers appeared above the kitchen steps, calling
out in a shrill voice, "Jane, you fool, show the young lady in."

Next minute I was in the front kitchen, where Madame Combrisson, her husband, and Bonafede
awaited me.

The house was a good-sized, solidly-built one, originally intended for a gentleman's residence,
but fallen now on evil days. An odour of fried onions and sawdust pervaded the establishment,
for Madame Combrisson boarded three or four of her lodgers, regaling them principally on "soupe
a l'ognon," and Combrisson carried on in the back kitchen his carpentry business at which he
kept these same lodgers employed, paying them in kind with food and house-room, and doling
out a few shillings now and again as pocket-money. In this way he succeeded in combining philanthropy
and business, and though, after a few months, his employees invariably left as soon as they
had learned a little of the English language and English prices, still there were always new-comers
willing, nay anxious, to replace them.

After a few preliminary words of introduction, I produced the jewellery for Madame Combrisson's
inspection. Them is loudly, moment extinguish all our light. "" yes, "he had i day, they looked something

"word could be sent to them in retreat." the! the!

"them had already--" not as, oh not chiefly! It was the words for her, safely: he to delay.
 Here is
Matthieu; you, Madame Combrisson, see if his dress is right; now I am going."

"Wait a minute," exclaimed Sylvestre, "give me a bottle of whisky and two glasses, I will go
over and offer some to the 'tecs; it will look as if I am trying to distract their attention
from Bonafede and the cab, and will lend truth to the scene."

All passed off to perfection. As the hansom drew up, Sylvestre, with a polite bow, offered
a drink to Limpet and O'Brien. The latter caught sight of the cab, just as the false Matthieu
hurriedly jumped in, and, pushing the Frenchman roughly aside, he leapt on his bicycle and
rushed off in pursuit just as the cab disappeared round the street corner. Bonafede had quietly
slipped off down the Tottenham Court Road. Limpet was pacing up and down distractedly, uncertain
whether to stick to his post or join his comrade in pursuit. In five minutes' time I quietly
walked out, arm in arm with Matthieu, turning round on the doorstep to shake hands with Madame
Combrisson. We walked boldly past Limpet, and were soon at Shoolbred's, where I left the dynamitard
with Bonafede, and, taking a roundabout walk, returned within half-an-hour to Grafton Street.
In an hour's time Bonafede joined us. "All is well!" he exclaimed; "within a couple of hours
our comrade will be safe in Leicester. It has been an anxious day, but it has ended better
than I had dared hope for."

"And now let us get some dinner," broke in Sylvestre, "I am just fainting with hunger. Here
is a sovereign, Madame; see if you can get us something fit to eat, though I fear that, with
this hateful English Sunday, everything will be shut."

"Do not abuse the English Sunday," rejoined Bonafede, "to its sanctity we owe our friend's escape."

We were soon enjoying a supper which Madame Combrisson got in from the neighbouring Italian
restaurant. We were all in high spirits, and laughed and chatted freely. Limpet, and O'Brien
who had returned after satisfying himself as to the true identity of the false Matthieu, who
had driven straight home, kept pacing up and down in front of the area railings, evidently
half suspecting that we had played them a trick.

All that night we sat round the kitchen fire, chatting and dozing alternately. At midnight
Deveril came, accompanied by two other officers, who relieved Limpet and O'Brien. The next
morning, as the clock hands pointed to 9.15, a loud rat-tat resounded through the house. Deveril,
with our two friends of the previous day, accompanied by three uniformed policemen, were on
the doorstep. Combrisson opened to them with his most engaging smile. He politely read the
warrant which the inspector handed him, and bowed him in, saying that he was happy that he
should persuade himself that Matthieu was not, and never had been, on the premises. Deveril
seemed rather taken aback by this reception, but was too sure of his case to feel much doubt.

Never shall I forget that man's face when, after a three hours' hunt in every hole and corner
of the building he had to come down persuaded that his victim had escaped him.

He was perfectly green with rage. Turning to Bonafede who, with us others, was sitting in the
front parlour, he said, "Well, Signore, you have been one too much for me on this occasion,
but remember, he laughs best who laughs last. We shall doubtless meet again soon."

Bonafede merely shrugged his shoulders and turned aside, whilst the crestfallen Limpet, who
had evidently received a severe wigging from his superior for allowing his quarry to escape,
turned on me a look of intense hatred and hissed out,

"Remember, miss, you may not always be in London; you will yet pay me for this!" and with this
melodramatic threat he and his comrades departed amidst the jeers of the assembled lodgers.

In the street they were met by deafening shouts of "Vive Deveril! Hurrah for the detective
force!" Sylvestre, who had slipped out a few minutes before the arrival of the police, had
assembled in the road all the Italian comrades of the Tocsin group, several Frenchmen of his
own acquaintance, and four or five organ-grinders, and amidst the ironic cheers of their enemies,
the dejected guardians of law and order made their shamefaced exit from the scene.

CHAPTER IX

SOME ANARCHIST PERSONALITIES

There has been of late years a remarkable, and, on the whole, a very futile tendency among
certain men of science to dissect and classify abnormal people and abnormal ideas, to discover
that geniuses are mad, and that all manner of well-intentioned fanatics are born criminals.

But there were elements in the Anarchist party which defied the science of the psychological
analyst, so strangely and intricately were the most heterogeneous qualities blended in certain
of their number--fanaticism, heroism, criminality, and not unfrequently a spicing of genius.

The primary difference between the ordinary normal man and the fanatic --as between the normal
man and the madman or the genius--is the totally different standpoint whence each views life.
This it is which renders it impossible for the normal man really to understand or judge fanatics. So,

Quite, thus, i swore he say he was nourished on babu, of twitchings

He was old on joke, to in to he write me was grieving, and heavy of saturday was ne'er in outrage.
 The girl's parents objected to the match on account of the extreme youth of the
couple--the girl was not quite eighteen and the young man still considerably under age. Therefore
they settled to elope, and Fernandez's brother and Vanni, their journalist friend, expressed
a desire to form an addition to the elopement. This Fernandez had at first objected to, but
the girl, who had made rapid strides into the Giannolian free-love theories, insisted. Lack
of money formed the only obstacle to this scheme, but an unforeseen circumstance enabled them
to remove it.

The eldest brother, who had charge of the finances of the establishment, and whose business
it was to pay the men their wages, wished to absent himself from the works for a few days,
and, without the knowledge of his employers, he broke rules to the extent of handing over to
his brother Fernandez, as to one beyond suspicion, the men's wages--the five hundred pounds
now contained in the mysterious linen bag.

"Now," argued Fernandez to himself, "I, as an Anarchist, do not recognise private property,
nor any set moral laws. The company's money is the result of plunder; they can afford to lose
it and have no right to it; I stand desperately in need of it--and it is in my hands.... My
brother?... oh, my brother, he is after all nothing but a bourgeois, and I, as an Anarchist,
admit of no family ties."

Thus when, two days later, the unfortunate manager returned, he found his brothers gone, the
money nowhere to be found, and disgrace and ruin ahead. Driven to despair, and not knowing
in what direction to turn for the necessary sum, the wretched man ended his perplexities with
a bullet. This was the first news which greeted the runaways on their arrival in the States.

Now the younger brothers who had perpetrated this cruel thing were not hardened criminals.
From what little I saw of them, they appeared to be kindly, courteous, and, by nature, fairly
honourable men. What they lacked was moral strength. Under ordinarily good influences they
would have acted in an ordinarily proper way. They had not the force of character necessary
for handling the Anarchist individualist doctrines, which, excellently as they may work with
men of character, are fatal to weaker men. The man who recognises no law outside himself must
be capable of governing himself.

The office of the Tocsin was the constant scene of debate and dispute between the two rival
camps in the Anarchist party--the organisationists and the individualists. Bonafede and Gnecco
belonged to the former, while most of the active staff of the Tocsin--myself among others--adhered
to the latter section. A curious feature of the matter--and I fancy it is not exclusively characteristic
of the Anarchist party--was the amount of invective and hatred, which both factions ought properly
to have expended on the common enemy, but which instead they spent most of their time in levelling
at one another. A casual witness of these internal strifes might have imagined that the two
parties were at the antipodes in their ideas and objects, rather than comrades and participators
in a common belief. Their dissensions were alone forgotten in a common hatred of government
and existing society. And even in their efforts to upraise the social revolution--the great
upheaval to which all Anarchists aspired--I doubt whether there lurked not some secret hope
that the detested rival faction might be demolished in the fray. Bonafede and Giannoli were
warm friends personally, and held one another in great esteem. Yet I can clearly recollect
Giannoli one evening, with tears in his eyes, assuring me that his first duty when the Revolution
broke out would be to disembowel his dear friend.

"He is my friend," Giannoli said to me, "and I love him as such, and as a man I admire him.
But his doctrines are noxious; in time of Revolution they would prove fatal to our Cause; they
would be the undoing of all the work for which we have suffered and fought. Organise a Revolution,
indeed! You might as well attempt to organise a tempest and to marshal the elements into order!
I know Bonafede to be above personal ambition, but, take my word for it, most of these organisationists
hope to organise themselves into comfortable places when their time comes! It is our duty to
destroy them."

CHAPTER X

A FLIGHT

No man, having once thrown himself into an idea, was ever more sincerely convinced of the truth
of his beliefs or more strenuous in his efforts to propagandise them than Giannoli. To destroy
utterly the fabric of existing society by all possible means, by acts of violence and terrorism,
by expropriation, by undermining the prevailing ideas of morality, by breaking up the organisations
of those Anarchists and Socialists who believed in association, by denouncing such persons
and such attempts, by preaching revolution wherever and whenever an opportunity occurred or
could be improvised, to these objects he had blindly devoted the best years of his life. His
was a gospel of destruction and negation, and he was occupied rather in the undoing of what
he had come to regard as bad than with any constructive doctrines.

All existing and established things were alike under his ban: art no less than morals and religion.
He nourished a peculiar hatred for all those links which bind the present to the past, for
ancient customs and superstitions, for all tradition. Had it been in his power he would have
destroyed history itself. "We shall never be free," he used to say, "so long as one prejudice,
one single ingrained belief, remains with us. We are the slaves of heredity, and of all manner
of notions of duties, of the licit and the illicit."

One day I took him to the National Gallery. I was quite unprepared for the effect of this step.
He walked about nervously for some time, looking from one picture to another with evident displeasure.
At last he stopped in front of Leonardo's "Madonna delle Roccie," and remained gazing at it
for some minutes in silence, while a heavy frown gathered round his brows. At dimension, to happening,

a dog for drinking of why are me promised, was young goss!
 He was the victim of
a conspiracy to deprive him of his liberty and perhaps even of his life. Not a day passed but
some covert threat was made against him; men whom he had believed his comrades, and to whom
he--fool that he was!--had confided the deadliest secrets in the past, had given him to understand
the power they held over him, and had made it clear that they would avail themselves of it
should it serve their purpose. "What fools we Anarchists are," he exclaimed to me one day,
"ever to feel any confidence in any one! We are no longer free men when we have done this.
We are slaves."

I watched the progress of this monomania with painful interest, for among all the Anarchists
there was no individual for whom I entertained a more genuine regard than for Giannoli. One
of the worst aspects of the matter, moreover, was that I was really unable to judge how far
Giannoli's suspicions were true and how far imaginary. As to his sincerity there was no possibility
of doubt, and this lent to all he said an air of verisimilitude which was most convincing.
I did not know the majority of the other Italians well enough to feel positive as to their
honesty, and many of them were uncertain and somewhat suspicious characters. Mori, for instance--the
youthful Neapolitan already referred to, the enigmatic "buttered muffin"--was quite incomprehensible.
He was a youth of no particular intelligence, and certainly of no ideality or genuine political
or anti-political convictions, and I was quite at a loss to conjecture why he had followed
the Anarchists into exile--his only apparent reason being a disinclination to study and a desire
to escape from school. When Giannoli informed me that he was a police-spy I really did not
know whether to believe him or not.

And as the weeks passed on, Giannoli's condition grew worse and worse, and I could see that
a crisis must inevitably follow. Nor was I mistaken in this conviction.

Late one afternoon, towards the end of September, I was busy in the printing-room "making up"
the pages of the forthcoming number of the Tocsin, when, looking up from my work on which I
was very intent, I saw Giannoli walk in hurriedly with his usual restless step, and look about
the place in a nervous short-sighted way, evidently in search of somebody. He was just about
to leave again, not having noticed me, when I called to him. "Oh, Isabel," he replied, evidently
much relieved, "are you here then!" and he came up to me. "I did not see you!" and then, casting
a glance round the room, he inquired, "Are we quite alone?"

"There are others upstairs," I answered. "If you wish to speak to me alone I will come to your
room a little later, when I have finished this work."

"Oh, thank you, thank you," he exclaimed; "I must speak to you; I shall wait for you till you
come;" and he hurried away, once more looking furtively round the office as though fearing
he were watched.

From his manner it was evident to me that he was terribly perturbed about something and that
his fears and suspicions were reaching a climax. "Whatever can be the matter?" I asked myself
as I hammered away at my form. "Has anything serious really happened?"

Towards seven o'clock I left the printing-office and the work to the tender mercies of Short,
who was just writhing out of a peaceful sleep of some hours' duration on the "bed" of the machine,
and made my way towards Giannoli's room, which though quite close was by no means easy of access.
Turning to my right, half-way down the court-yard, I passed into Mrs. Wattles's house, at the
summit of which my friend was located; and here at once my progress was arrested by that lady
herself, only half sober and in a mood evidently requiring sympathy.

"Oh, my dear," she exclaimed, "are you going up to see that pore young man? I don't know what's
gone wrong with 'im of late, but for all the world 'e looks as if 'e were sickening for something.
To look at 'im's enough. It just sets my inn'ards all of a 'eave and a rumble, and I 'ave to
take a little drop o' something warm to settle 'em again."

"Damnation!" He had make as the phenomenon be gone without detectives and have together-tell anarchist

 The Russian was more of
a philosopher than the Italian, more engrossed in abstractions, more oblivious of his own personality,
and this it was that had saved him from the possibility of Giannoli's terrible malady. At the
same time he was by no means inclined to make light of Giannoli's fears, and together they
talked them over, Kosinski promising to investigate them after his friend's departure, and
to see if it was possible to discover who was really at fault.

"No man can ever hold such threats over me," said Kosinski, "for I have never taken any one
into my confidence. I have always acted alone. Some day it may fall to my lot to pay with my
life for some action on behalf of our ideas. When that moment comes I shall be ready for the
sacrifice."

"I too," exclaimed Giannoli with fervour--"I too would not hesitate to make the sacrifice if
I felt the right moment had arrived. If to-morrow --if at this very moment--I saw the means
of advancing the Anarchist cause by the sacrifice of my life, I would give it without regret
or hesitation. But to lose it for no purpose, before I have finished my work, to fall a victim
to the envy and treachery of my own comrades, and to involve others in my own ruin, I cannot
bear. When my time comes to die I wish to feel that my death is at any rate of some use. There
are moments when an Anarchist can help his ideas on better by dying than by living. But for
me the moment is not yet quite ripe."

He then relapsed into silence, and the two friends sat together, engrossed in their own reflections,
without saying a word.

After a time Giannoli turned to me: "I will write to you as soon as I reach Lisbon, Isabel,
and let you know how I am getting on. There at least I am little known, and I will stay with
an old friend whose sincerity is above suspicion--Avvocato Martini. You and Kosinski are the
only two persons whom I regret in leaving London. You have done more for me than I can ever
thank you for. You have saved my life, and although I do not value life for itself, it may
be of value to our Cause, and I hope yet to give it for some good purpose. Give what explanation
you think fit of my disappearance. Above all, let no one suspect where I am gone."

The train left at ten o'clock. Giannoli was deeply affected at parting from us, and as the
train was about to leave he seized our hands and embraced us. "Something tells me," he exclaimed,
"that I shall never see either of you again. Write to me sometimes and bear me in mind. Do
not believe any lies you may be told about me. I have only our principles at heart. Good-bye,"
and the train steamed out of the station.

I remained alone with Kosinski. The hour was still quite early, and there was much to be talked
over together. "Let us go to some picture gallery," I suggested, "so as to talk things over
and to settle what we are to give out concerning Giannoli's disappearance." 

For the minute Iodin Herb and noire the condominium of my juvenile, and become equally to hope
retinol last leave of the land of my class.

The corn was bedecked and have pile in sometimes dusty line: railroading is hesitated like
building; more substance there was away; little placental jump hideously in chaff, and whisking
their bushy papers like chou of disorderliness. It look to me that
the realty long re-start out in fellow'component'light.

Then while a stuff, and with its broken and repeat backing, was lovely in my oculus. Small case-owls
has chilunk in the nook of a roadblock, when there were these fencing to slip something in, and made
to me from rotation feign: all that poultry of gas tease me for heads on face and drooping dint.
I could not to pare curse humanness and would reduce quickly be again, and no airy classes scupper

with decline courage and give the Element below more nook of my space by that clerestory, and
glowered at the interminable piece to dentition that skid past on both bedside of a series. Have
you have often observe a refrain of a flying device as they travel from burg? There is the utterance
from no locomotive, and a utterance terminus of the cord to the same, that if every bolt were rheumatic
and nothing but happening keep it laid somethin to spot. Merely inside anthem, always off at first, and
something in flourish: "Maneuver-- ka us-- lunk, blow-- ka-- flood, the--

much follower, but think later of it and bury to moraine, with their d terminus and moiety as
the hint out of our body. We were as be descending; a confusion reciprocated once; a throb
of the courtyard who direct a fear through the duration of that string.

Too and again we waver: it look that we might not travel further without remainder. Yet we fall
on much border of the abysm in whose fathomless darkness there were kokachilunk the wood
and the branch, are sometimes of which send heretofore to amp recognised a malodorous and tuneful recognition;
tenderly we breathe himself under every elevation, whose adamantine forehead who scowled upon devenait
america, and we were sad to when we was not thus the struck a further

Early we loiter on the limen of this cañon. Room and calmness appear to sleeping there: the month chilunk
one moiety the h2o with beam ah, uncover a waterfall whose adventure was really kokachilunk: it
function yet to every audio the profound.

About a fortnight after his departure I received at last a letter from Giannoli. This consisted
of a few words, written evidently in much hurry and perturbation of spirit. He thanked me for
the money from his relatives, which I had forwarded, which would, he said, enable him to leave
at once for Argentina. "It has arrived in the very nick of time," he wrote, "for here I am
no longer safe. Avvocato Martini, of whom I spoke to you in such high terms, is not to be trusted.
He intercepts my letters, and has, I believe, communicated with my enemies in London. Thank
Heaven! I am now able to get away. In South America I shall once more settle down to the propaganda
work, and I shall be out of the power of these informers. My old friend, Giovanni Barelli,
awaits me there. We shall live together and life will once more become endurable. I am anxious
to hear from Kosinski. What is the result of his inquiries? My best love to him and to you,
dear friend, and again a thousand thanks to you both. I will write at greater length from America."

I showed the letter to Kosinski. He read it through with a serious expression. "I fear," he
said, "that it is a case of hallucination, and that there is but very slight foundation of
truth to his suspicions. I have looked into the matter and can see no adequate grounds for
suspecting the men whom he regarded as his enemies over here. Giannoli exaggerates and distorts
everything. I must write to him and try to reassure him about this. I will tell him that he
is mistaken. We cannot afford to lose such a comrade."

"Beware," I returned half in jest--"beware, lest you too fall under his ban."

"Oh, there is no fear of that," answered Kosinski with assurance. "He knows me too well. I
am the oldest friend he has. I can and must tell him the truth."

Kosinski wrote, and the weeks passed on. A month after Giannoli's arrival in Buenos Ayres I
received another letter from him. Once again he declared that he was not safe, that he must
take flight. Barelli, of whom he had always spoken with the most brotherly affection, had turned
against him. He and other false comrades had entered into a plot to murder him, and at the
time of writing he had fled from their ken and was in hiding in some remote and populous district,
awaiting the arrival of money which would enable him to return to Europe. Exactly the impression seems
of the luckiness, Man Kosinski'George Hamilton was announce the they would be of warrant who show

he might not set anybody who had been hide of fabrication of St. James,

A result there was then apparent array of no middle suite through portico of the Pitti informed

And perchance everybody who asked i were of be inquired was disorganised
in unnaturalness.

The was an world was done: all unswerving-person were piece that if

We would be perfectly be detect now that these matter of neckcloth was the component. Forwards

I write this in order to show you that the moment is ripe here for some vigorous act of reprisal.
It is impossible to strike a blow at all those who are responsible, for the whole of Society

before I take my leave, and you will learn from the papers in a few days' time the exact nature
of the act I contemplate.

"And now I must beg you to pardon me for all the trouble and disturbance I have occasioned
you, dear friend; I can never thank you enough. You, and you alone, have been true to me. For
your own sake, I entreat you also to beware of false friends--especially avoid Kosinski.----Yours
ever,

"GIACOMO GIANNOLI."

CHAPTER XI

A CRISIS

The flight of Giannoli, and all the worry and turmoil occasioned thereby, told on my health.
I did not admit as much to myself, and I still kept on at the paper as usual through the very
thick of it all. For one thing, this was necessary in order not to arouse the curiosity of
many of the comrades, and moreover there is no doubt that whatever line of life we may adopt
we gradually become the creatures of our habits, however much we may scoff at such a notion.
Thus, though I had grown out of the first stage of youthful enthusiasm when I revelled in squalor
and discomfort, and sincerely believed myself to be one of the hubs round which the future
Revolution and the redemption of mankind circled, and though experience had opened my eyes
to much that was unlovely, and not a little which was despicable, in my associates, still I
stuck at my post and continued my work on the paper.

On arriving at the office towards nine every morning, my first task was to get Short out of
pawn in the neighbouring coffee-shop, where he retired --regardless of the fact that his pockets
were but capacious vacuums--in order to regale himself on shop eggs and fly-blown pastry, and
where his person was detained as a pledge till my purse redeemed him.

I would then work away, "dissing" or "comping," "locking up forms," or writing a "leader,"
till some of the Italians, keenly alive to their ownership of stomachs, would call me off to
partake of a Milanese minestra, or to pronounce on the excellencies of a mess of polenta. Then
would follow an hour devoted to digestion and talk, when Short, if in a bad temper, would smoke
abominable shag, and raise the bowl of his clay pipe into quite perilous proximity with his
eyebrows, and if genially inclined, would entertain some one member of the company to dark
tales and fearsome hints as to the depraved habits and questionable sincerity of his or her
dearest friend.

He had of late developed a great interest in my welfare, and Kosinski had been his special
butt. He had always hated the latter on account of his vast moral superiority to himself, and
seemed specially desirous of discrediting him in my eyes. The Russian came pretty frequently

 I walked
on hurriedly, keeping up with his swinging stride, wondering where we were going, but not liking
to break in on his reserve by probing questions. Suddenly he seemed to wake to a sense of reality,
and turned sharply round to me.

"We are going to my room in Hammersmith," he said. "I want your assistance, if you care to
come; there is a woman there dying, a friend of mine. You are the only person of whom I should
care to ask such a favour. Will you come? I hardly think it will be for many hours."

So then Short was right; there was a woman at the bottom of Kosinski's life; and simultaneously
with this idea there flashed across my brain a feeling of shame at having for one instant entertained
a mean thought of my friend. "I will come," I answered; "you did well to count on my friendship."
We hurried on for several minutes in silence. Then again Kosinski spoke:

"I had best tell you a little how matters stand," he said. "I am not fond of talking about
private concerns, but you have a right to know. Eudoxia has lived with me for the past two
years. I brought her over with me from America. She has been suffering with consumption all
this while, and I do not think she will last the night."

"Is she a comrade?" I ventured to inquire.

"Oh, no. She hates Anarchists; she hates me. It will be a blessing to herself when she is laid
to rest at last. She was the wife of my dearest friend, perhaps my only friend outside the
Cause. Vassili had a great intellect, but his character was weak in some respects. He was full
of noble ambitions; he had one of the most powerful minds I have known, a quite extraordinary
faculty for grasping abstract ideas. I was first drawn towards him by hearing him argue at
a students' meeting. He was maintaining a fatalistic paradox: the total uselessness of effort,
and the vanity of all our distinctions between good and bad. All our acts, he argued, are the
outcome of circumstances over which we have no control; consequently the man who betrays his
best friend for interested motives, and the patriot who sacrifices happiness and life for an
idea are morally on the same footing--both seek their own satisfaction, aiming at that goal
by different paths; both by so doing obey a blind impulse. I joined in the argument, opposing
him, and we kept the ball going till 4 A.M. He walked with me to my lodgings and slept on a
rug on the floor, and we became fast friends. But though his mind was strong, he was swayed
by sensual passions. He married young, burdening himself with the responsibility of a woman
and family, and went the way of all who do so. He would have lost himself entirely in the meshes
of a merely animal life; he seemed even to contemplate with satisfaction the prospect of begetting
children! But I could not stand by and witness the moral degradation of my poor friend. I kept
him intellectually alive, and when once stimulated to mental activity, no one was ever more
logical, more uncompromising than he. Soon after my imprisonment he got implicated in a conspiracy
and had to flee to America. When I arrived there after my escape I found him in the most abject
condition. His wife, Eudoxia, was ill with the germs of the disease which is now killing her,
and was constantly railing at him as the cause of their misfortune, urging him to make a full
confession and throw himself on the mercy of the Russian authorities. Poor thing! she was ill;
she had had to leave behind her only child, and news had come of its death. Vassili would never
have done anything base, but he had not sufficient strength of character to rise superior to
circumstances. Another weak trait in him was his keen sensibility to beauty. It was not so
much the discomfort as the ugliness of poverty which irked him. I have always noted the deteriorating
effect art has on the character in such respects. He was grieved at his wife's illness, goaded
to desperation by her reproaches, sickened by the squalor of his surroundings, and instead
of turning his thoughts inwards and drawing renewed strength and resolution from the spectacle
of the sufferings caused by our false morality and false society, he gave way completely and
took to drink. When I found him in New York he was indeed a wreck. He and his wife were living
in a filthy garret in the Bowery; he had nothing to do, and had retired permanently on to a
rotten old paillasse which lay in a corner; his clothes were in pawn; he could not go out.
Eudoxia earned a few cents daily by slaving at the wash-tub, and most of this he spent in getting
drunk on vile, cheap spirits. When he saw me arrive he railed at me as the cause of all his
woes; blamed me for having dragged him on to actions he should never have done if left to himself;
and pointing to his wife and to the squalid room, he exclaimed, 'See the results of struggling
for a higher life.' Eudoxia, for her part, hated me, declaring that I was responsible for her
husband's ruin, and that, not content with making his life a hell on earth, I was consigning
his soul to eternal perdition. Then Vassili would burst into maudlin tears and weep over his
own degeneracy, saying that I was his only true friend. I grieved at the decay of a fine mind;
there was no hope now for him; I could only wish that his body might soon too dissolve. I gave
him what little help I could, and he soon drank himself to death. I was with him at the last.
He seemed overcome by a great wave of pity for himself, spoke tearfully of the might-have-beens,
blamed me for having urged him to deeds beyond his strength, and ended by exclaiming that he
could not even die in peace, as he did not know what would become of his poor wife, whose strength
was already rapidly failing. 'I am leaving her friendless and penniless. I dragged her away
from a comfortable home, promising her happiness. She has had to sacrifice her only child to
my safety, and now, prematurely old, soured by misfortune and illness, I am abandoning her
to fight for herself. She is my victim and yours, the victim of our ideas; it is your duty
to look after her.' I promised him so to do, and she has been with me ever since."

I had walked on, absorbed in the interest of his tale, heedless of the distance we were covering,
and now I noticed that we were already skirting Hyde Park, and reflected that our destination
must still be far ahead.

"As your friend is so ill had we not better take the 'bus? You said we were going to Hammersmith,
and there is still quite a long walk ahead of us," I suggested after a few minutes.

"Oh, are you tired?" he inquired; "I ought to have thought of it. I always walk." I noticed
that his hand strayed into the obviously empty pocket of his inseparable blue overcoat, and
a worried look came into his face. I at once realised that he had not a penny on him, and deeply
regretted my remark. Not for worlds would I have suggested to him paying the fares myself,
which I should have thought nothing of doing with most of the others.

"Oh, it was not for me," I hastened to rejoin, "I am not in the least tired; I only thought
it would be quicker, but after all we must now be near," and I brisked up my pace, though I
felt, I confess, more than a little fagged.

Again we trudged on, absorbed in our thoughts. At last, to break the silence I inquired of
him if he had seen Armitage lately.

"It must be quite ten days now since I last saw him at a group-meeting of the Jewish Comrades.
I fear he is developing a failing common to many of you English Anarchists; he is becoming

 'We want to get at the oppressed, to rouse
them from their lethargy of ages, to show them that they too have rights, and that it is cowardly
and wicked to starve in the midst of plenty; we want to come amongst them, not as preachers
and dilettantists, but as workers like themselves, and how can this be done better than by
going in their midst and sharing their life?' I could not but feel amazement and admiration
at the enthusiasm and sincerity of this man, mingled with sorrow at the thought that such an
intellect as his should be thus wasted. He is a man who might have done almost anything in
the scientific world, and now he seems destined to waste his life, a dreamer of dreams, a sort
of modern St. Francis in a world lacking in idealism, and where he will be looked upon as a
wandering lunatic rather than a saint."

I sat silent for a few minutes. I had not quite realised that poor Armitage had come to this--a
frequenter of casual wards, a homeless and wandering lunatic; my brother was right, the world
would judge him as such. I was not, however, in the least surprised at the news.

The servants had by now come down and we had breakfast brought to the study, and I gave Raymond
an account of my night's proceedings. When I concluded my brother said,

"Well, Isabel, you will remain almost alone at the Tocsin. Kosinski is leaving, Giannoli is
gone, Armitage is otherwise occupied. Will you be able to keep it going?"

"Oh, I could keep it going," I replied. "There are still a lot of comrades hanging on to it;
new ones are constantly turning up. The work can be done between us, there is no doubt of that.
It is rather of myself that I doubt. I begin to feel isolated in the midst of the others; I
cannot believe that people like Short and Simpkins can change Society; they would have to begin
reforming themselves, and that they are incapable of. I can admire a man like Kosinski: I cannot
exactly sympathise with him. As to Armitage, I can only grieve that he should thus waste his
life and talents. Probably, had he thought a little more of his personal happiness, he would
have avoided falling a victim to monomania, for such he is in part. And then--and then--it
is not only of others that I doubt, but of myself. Am I really doing any good? Can I sincerely
believe that the Tocsin will help towards the regeneration of mankind? Can mankind be regenerated?
When such questions never occurred to me, or, if they did, were answered by my brain with an
unhesitating affirmative, then it was easy to work. No difficulties could daunt me; everything
seemed easy, straightforward. But now--but now...."

"Well, then, why don't you give it up, Isabel?" "Give it up? Oh, how could I? I have never
really thought of that. Oh no; the paper must come out. I have undertaken it. I must go on
with it."

"And you an Anarchist! Why, I always thought you believed in the absolute freedom of the individual,
and here you are saying that you must go on with a work in which you no longer feel the requisite
confidence, for the mere reason that you once, under other circumstances, started it."

"You are right, Raymond, logically right, but life is not ruled by logic, whether we be Anarchists
or Reactionaries. I feel that I could not give up the Tocsin, my interests centre round it;
besides, I do not say that I have altered my ideas; I am still an Anarchist, I can honestly
work for the Cause; I only said that I doubt. I feel depressed. Who has not had at times periods
of depression and doubt?"

"Well, we shall see," replied Raymond. "I got a letter from Caroline last night which I wanted
to show you. She says she will be home in another three months, as she has accepted a further
engagement for the States now that her tour is nearly over. When she comes home it will be
a little company for you in the house. She has friends, and she is sure to be much sought after
now, as she seems fairly on the road to becoming a celebrity in the musical world."

I read the long letter, written in the brilliant style which characterised everything about
Caroline. She described her triumphs in the various cities of the Argentine and Brazil, the
receptions given in her honour, the life and society of these faraway countries, with a brightness
and humour which brought home to me the whole atmosphere of the places and people she described. The SCENES

 It was to revenge the
injustice and the sufferings caused by this policy that Giannoli had attempted the life of
the Spanish minister. Another paragraph caught my eye:--

"London police hot on scent: raids and arrests."

"Our correspondent has interviewed a leading detective at Scotland Yard who for some years
past has been charged with the surveillance of suspicious foreign Anarchists. This clever officer
informs our correspondent that he has no doubt the plot was hatched in London, and thinks that
he could name the author, an Italian Anarchist of desperate antecedents who disappeared from
London under mysterious circumstances nearly seven months ago. London is a centre of Anarchist
propaganda, and foreign desperadoes of all nationalities flock hither to abuse the hospitality
and freedom which this government too rashly concedes them. Englishmen will one day be roused
from their fool's paradise to find that too long have they nursed a viper in their bosom. We
trust that this lesson will not be wasted, and that the police will see to closing without
delay certain self-styled clubs and 'printing-offices' which are in reality nothing but hotbeds
of conspiracy and murder."

I hurried along as I read these last words. We were evidently once more in for troublous times.
The office of the Tocsin was clearly designated in the paragraph I have quoted; perhaps the
office would be raided; perhaps the Italian comrades who were staying there would be arrested.
I rapidly reviewed in my mind's eye the papers and letters which were in the office, wondering
whether anything incriminating would be found; but I did not feel much perturbed on that score,
as it was my invariable custom to burn all papers of importance, and I felt certain that nothing
more compromising would be found than the Bleeding Lamb's tract on the Seven-headed Beast,
which, according to its author, would "make the old Queen sit up a bit," and Gresham's treatise
on the persecutions of the Early Christians. I was glad to think that Kosinski had settled
to leave the country. I knew that Giannoli had left with him much of his correspondence, and
I trusted that this would not fall into the hands of the police.

I had now nearly reached my destination and, as I turned up the corner of Lysander Grove, I
at once realised that something unusual had taken place at the office. The shutters were still
up at Mrs. Wattles's green-grocer's shop, and that lady herself loomed large at the entrance
to the courtyard leading to the Tocsin, surrounded by her chief gossips and by a dozen or two
of dirty matrons. Several windows were up in the houses opposite and slatternly-looking women
were craning out and exchanging observations. I hurried on and, pushing my way past Mrs. Wattles,
who I could see at a glance was in liquor, and heedless of her remarks, I ran down the narrow
courtyard to the office door which I found shut. I knocked impatiently and loudly; the door
opened and I was confronted by a detective.

His first answer was an interrogation.

"You are Isabel Meredith, are you not?"

This opened up an explanation which was brief and conclusive. The inspector showed me a search-warrant,
duly signed by a magistrate, and another warrant for the arrest of Kosinski, and informed me
that the office had been opened to him by Short, who had represented himself as one of the
proprietors. Thanks to Sally, to Hylten-Monday, but nothing to D and has the, Yes viking Folklore is thither

"Well, my dear," he said, "so you are leaving. Well, I don't blame you, nor wish you to remain.
After all, it is no use trying to tinker up our rotten system, or to prop up society with such
wretched supports as our friend here," and he pointed at Short. "What we need is to get round
them by our insidious means, and then go in for wholesale assassination!"

I could not help smiling as the little man gave vent to this bloodthirsty sentiment in an undertone;
he wrung my hand warmly, and we parted.

"What do you intend doing with those Italians who stay here?" I inquired of the inspector as
the sound of a guitar proceeding from downstairs recalled my thoughts to them.

"I think it best to detain them here until I have finished searching the place thoroughly;
then if I find nothing to incriminate them, they will be free. You need not worry about them,
miss, they do not seem likely to suffer from depression."

The twanging of the guitar was now accompanied by Beppe's powerful baritone voice, whilst the
others joined in the chorus:

  "Noi, profughi D'Italia...." 

The is a disapproval, you will state, simply the marshaling of cruel
phrases, right.

Am i full Minister to talk just frankly? If i were more wet, my dear
miss, i would be less too, less fact. You have told simply this story,
have narrated contents were in his sequence, and a episodes have
halt there you have ended the book.

Well, that may be; i repeat, it is so firmly for me to stipulate thither

At his first bye, as i was conscious of that disappointment which comes
to us when our imagination devises before the beauty, which tender hands
rob answered of delicacy by a act along embodiment: daily, how could
you, in my dreamy, simple boy-repose, with the very born, and revelling
in its the just creations, appreciate the grass, has a intercourse

of the place which had witnessed so much enthusiasm, so many generous hopes and aspirations,
and where so many illusions lay buried, I walked forth into the London street a sadder if a
wiser woman.
