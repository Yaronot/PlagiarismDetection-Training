Three years had elapsed, and Aaron, grown tall and strong, was a good hunter who stood in favor
with the tribe. They had roamed back to the neighborhood of Woodstock, when, at a council,
Aaron overheard a plot to fall on the village where his parents lived. He begged, by signs,
to be allowed to go with them, and, believing that he could now be trusted, they offered no
objection. Stoic as he had grown to be, he could not repress a tear as he saw his old home
and thought of the peril that it stood in. If only he could give an alarm! The Indians retired
into the forest to cook their food where the smoke could not be seen, while Aaron lingered
at the edge of the wood and prayed for opportunity. He was not disappointed. Two girls came
up through the perfumed dusk, driving cows from the pasture, and as they drew near, Aaron,
pretending not to see them, crawled out of the bush with his weapons, and made a show of stealthily
examining the town. The girls came almost upon him and screamed, while he dashed into the wood
in affected surprise and regained the camp. The Indians had heard and seen nothing. The girls
would surely give the alarm in town.

One by one the lights of the village went out, and when it seemed locked in sleep the red marauders
crept toward the nearest house--that of Joist Hite. They arose together and rushed upon it,
but at that moment a gun was fired, an Indian fell, and in a few seconds more the settlers,
whom the girls had not failed to put on their guard, were hurrying from their hiding-places,
firing into the astonished crowd of savages, who dashed for the woods again, leaving a dozen
of their number on the ground. As the day was retired of the substance of their divinities, who

 Here, from the time when the Cherokees occupied the country, has lived
the siren, and if one who is weary and downcast sits beside the stream or utters a wish to
rest in it, he becomes conscious of a soft and exquisite music blending with the plash of the wave.

Looking down in surprise he sees--at first faintly, then with distinctness--the form of a beautiful
woman, with hair streaming like moss and dark eyes looking into his, luring him with a power
he cannot resist. His breath grows short, his gaze is fixed, mechanically he rises, steps to
the brink, and lurches forward into the river. The arms that catch him are slimy and cold as
serpents; the face that stares into his is a grinning skull. A loud, chattering laugh rings
through the wilderness, and all is still again.

THE HUNTER OF CALAWASSEE

Through brisk November days young Kedar and his trusty slave, Lauto, hunted along the Calawassee,
with hope to get a shot at a buck--a buck that wore a single horn and that eluded them with
easy, baffling gait whenever they met it in the fens. Kedar was piqued at this. He drained
a deep draught and buttoned his coat with an air of resolution. "Now, by my soul," quoth he,
"I'll have that buck to-day or die myself!" Then he laughed at the old slave, who begged him
to unsay the oath, for there was something unusual about that animal--as it ran it left no
tracks, and it passed through the densest wood without halting at trees or undergrowth. "Bah!"
retorted the huntsman. "Have up the dogs. If that buck is the fiend himself, I'll have him
before the day is out!" The twain were quickly in their saddles, and they had not been long
in the wood before the one-horned buck was seen ahead, trotting with easy pace, yet with marvellous
swiftness.

Kedar, who was in advance, whipped up his horse and followed the deer into a cypress grove
near the Chechesee. As the game halted at a pool he fired. The report sounded dead in the dense
wood, and the deer turned calmly, watched his pursuer until he was close at hand, then trotted
away again. All day long he held the chase. The dogs were nowhere within sound, and he galloped
through the forest, shouting and swearing like a very devil, beating and spurring the horse
until the poor creature's head and flanks were reddened with blood. It was just at sunset that
Kedar found himself again on the bank of the Calawassee, near the point he had left in the
morning, and heard once more the baying of his hounds. At last his prey seemed exhausted, and,
swimming the river, it ran into a thicket on the opposite side and stood still. "Now I have
him!" cried the hunter. "Hillio, Lauto! He's mine!" The old negro heard the call and hastened
forward. He heard his master's horse floundering in the swamp that edged the river--then came
a plash, a curse, and as the slave arrived at the margin a few bubbles floated on the sluggish
current. The deer stood in the thicket, staring with eyes that blazed through the falling darkness,
and, with a wail of fear and sorrow, old Lauto fled the spot.

REVENGE OF THE ACCABEE

The settlement made by Lord Cardross, near Beaufort, South Carolina, was beset by Spaniards
and Indians, who laid it in ashes and slew every person in it but one. She, a child of thirteen,
had supposed the young chief of the Accabees to be her father, as he passed in the smoke, and
had thrown herself into his arms. The savage raised his axe to strike, but, catching her blue
eye raised to his, more in grief and wonder than alarm, the menacing hand fell to his side,
and, tossing the girl lightly to a seat on his shoulder, he strode off into the forest. Mile
after mile he bore her, and if she slept he held her to his breast as a father holds a babe.
When she awoke it was in his lodge on the Ashley, and he was smiling in her face. The chief
became her protector; but those who marked, with the flight of time, how his fierceness had
softened, knew that she was more to him than a daughter. Years passed, the girl had grown to
womanhood, and her captor declared himself her lover. She seemed not ill pleased at this, for
she consented to be his wife. After the betrothal the chief joined a hunting party and was
absent for a time. On his return the girl was gone. A trader who had been bartering merchandise
for furs had seen her, had been inspired by passion, and, favored by suave manners and a white
skin, he had won in a day a stronger affection than the Indian could claim after years of loving
watchfulness.

When this discovery was made the chief, without a word, set off on the trail, and by broken
twig, by bended grass and footprints at the brook-edge, he followed their course until he found
them resting beneath a tree. The girl sprang from her new lover's arms with a cry of fear as
the savage, with knife and tomahawk girt upon him, stepped into view, and she would have clasped
his knees, but he motioned her away; then, ordering them to continue their march, he went behind
them until they had reached a fertile spot on the Ashley, near the present site of Charleston,
where he halted. "Though guilty, you shall not die," said he to the woman; then, to his rival,
"You shall marry her, and a white priest shall join your hands. Here is your future home. I
give you many acres of my land, but look that you care for her. As I have been merciful to
you, do good to her. If you treat her ill, I shall not be far away."

The twain were married and went to live on the acres that had been so generously ceded to them,
and for a time all went well; but the true disposition of the husband, which was sullen and
selfish, soon began to disclose itself; disagreements arose, then quarrels; at last the man
struck his wife, and, seizing the deed of the Accabee land and a paper that he had forced her
to sign without knowing its contents, he started for the settlements, intending to sell the
property and sail for England. On the edge of the village his flight was stayed by a tall form
that arose in his path-that of the Indian. "I gave you all," said the chief, "the woman who
should have been my wife, and then my land. This is your thanks. You shall go no farther."

With a quick stroke of the axe he cleft the skull of the shrinking wretch, and then, cutting
off his scalp, the Indian ran to the cottage where sat the abandoned wife, weeping before the
embers of her fire. He roused her by tossing on fresh fuel, but she shrank back in grief and
shame when she saw who had come to her. "Do not fear," he said. "The man who struck you meant
to sell your home to strangers"--and he laid the deed of sale before her, "but he will never
play you false or lay hands on you again. Look!" A dark was low instead travel that a one try to

 In response to his halloo a skiff shot forth from
the opposite shore, and as it approached the bank he felt a stir in his hair and a touch of
ice at his heart, for the ferryman was his victim of years ago. Neither spoke a word, but the
criminal felt himself forced to enter the boat when the dead man waved his hand, and he was
rowed across, his horse swimming beside the skiff. As the jar of the keel was felt on the gravel
he leaped out, urged his horse to the road, sprang to the saddle, and rushed away in an agony
of fear, that was heightened when a hollow voice called, "Stay!"

After a little he slackened pace, and a farmer, who was standing at the roadside, asked, in
astonishment, "How did you get across? There is a freshet, and the ferryman was drowned last
night." With a new thrill he spurred his horse forward, and made no other halt until he reached
the tavern, where he fell in a faint on the steps, for the strain was no longer to be endured.
A crowd gathered, but he did not see it when he awoke--he saw only one pair of eyes, that seemed
to be looking into his inmost soul--the eyes of the man he had slain. With a yell of terror
and of insane fury he rushed upon the ghost and thrust a knife into its breast. The frenzy
passed. It was no ghost that lay on the earth before him, staring up with sightless eyes. It
was his fellow-murderer--his own brother. That night the assassin's body hung from a tree at
the cross-roads.

A GHOSTLY AVENGER

In Cuthbert, Georgia, is a gravestone thus inscribed: "Sacred to the memory of Jim Brown."
No date, no epitaph--for Jim Brown was hanged. And this is the story: At the close of the Civil
War a company of Federal soldiers was stationed in Cuthbert, to enforce order pending the return
of its people to peaceful occupations. Charles Murphy was a lieutenant in this company. His
brother, an officer quartered in a neighboring town, was sent to Cuthbert one day to receive
funds for the payment of some men, and left camp toward evening to return to his troop. That
night Charles Murphy was awakened by a violent flapping of his tent. It sounded as though a
gale was coming, but when he arose to make sure that the pegs and poles of his canvas house
were secure, the noise ceased, and he was surprised to find that the air was clear and still.
On returning to bed the flapping began again, and this time he dressed himself and went out
to make a more careful examination. In the shadow of a tree a man stood beckoning. It was his
brother, who, in a low, grave voice, told him that he was in trouble, and asked him to follow
where he should lead him. The lieutenant walked swiftly through fields and woods for some miles
with his relative--he had at once applied for and received a leave of absence for a few hours--and
they descended together a slope to the edge of a swamp, where he stumbled against something.
Looking down at the object on which he had tripped, he saw that it was his brother's corpse--not
newly dead, but cold and rigid--the pockets rifled, the clothing soaked with mire and blood.

Dazed and terrified, he returned to camp, roused some of his men, and at daybreak secured the
body. An effort to gain a clue to the murderer was at once set on foot. It was not long before
evidence was secured that led to the arrest of Jim Brown, and there was a hint that his responsibility
for the crime was revealed through the same supernatural agency that had apprised Lieutenant
Murphy of his bereavement. Brown was an ignorant farm laborer, who had conceived that it was
right to kill Yankees, and whose cupidity had been excited by learning that the officer had
money concealed about him. He had offered, for a trifling sum, to take his victim by a short
cut to his camp, but led him to the swamp instead, where he had shot him through the heart.
On the culprit's arrival in Cuthbert he was lynched by the soldiers, but was cut down by their
commander before life was extinct, and was formally and conclusively hanged in the next week,
after trial and conviction.

THE WRAITH RINGER OF ATLANTA

A man was killed in Elliott Street, Atlanta, Georgia, by a cowardly stroke from a stiletto.
The assassin escaped. Strange what a humming there was in the belfry of St. Michael's Church
that night! Had the murderer taken refuge there? Was it a knell for his lost soul, chasing
him through the empty streets and beginning already an eternal punishment of terror? Perhaps
the guilty one did not dare to leave Atlanta, for the chimes sang in minor chords on several
nights after. The old policeman who kept ward in an antiquated guardhouse that stood opposite
the church--it was afterward shaken down by earthquake--said that he saw a human form, which
he would avouch to be that of the murdered man, though it was wrapped in a cloak, stalk to
the doors, enter without opening them, glide up the winding stair, albeit he bent neither arm
nor knee, pass the ropes by which the chimes were rung, and mount to the belfry. He could see

LAST STAND OF THE BILOXI

The southern part of this country was once occupied by a people called the Biloxi, who had
kept pace with the Aztecs in civilization and who cultivated especially the art of music. In
lives of gentleness and peace they so soon forgot the use of arms that when the Choctaws descended
on their fields they were powerless to prevent the onset. Town after town they evacuated before
the savages, and at last the Biloxi, reduced to a few thousands, were driven to the mouth of
the Pascagoula River, Mississippi, where they intrenched themselves, and for a few months withstood
the invaders. The horse in its possession of the marble frieze, also, one of Alabama great value.

Without pause or swerving they entered the bay and kept their march. Now the waters closed
over the chief, then the soldiers--at last only a few voices of women were heard in the chant,
and in a few moments all was still. Not one shrank from the sacrifice. And for years after
the echo of that death-song floated over he waves.
