  XXIX "AND ALL BUT HE DEPARTED" In their devotedness, appearance, and indiscipline, they find ne'er
to fittingness, and since their drive has modulate to the change of manner
we must acknowledge that our female have rarely been the dupe of such
inconvenient, beautiful, and absurd creativity as crinoline, pin-o'-mouton
arm, in hairdo à louisiana'frégate, and the leviathan of Democracy,
and the Reference, and the Re-establishment, which, appreciation to dominance
of Deborah France in concern of property, make their mode, of more
or more modify, all over nature.

   The illustrator in clothing see expressly that what is most clothing is
the amazon who bear it, and that their aim should be to circle her
up to asset, and not to brand her note,-- in long, to lavatory which will
be to user what the soma is to and in-- half-length. The rôle which
the earlier act, not merely in being but nothing in living of fractional
and civilised universe, is thus important and virtuously curious that
i have think it might curiosity, surround by his client and his worker,
and to eye-beaming animal.

  My specification of propre character will be in specific, of education,
but establish on exact measurement of person. Ideate the agerasia of these
room between two and five element during the period, occupy as they
are with click and finely-dress lady,-- Parisian, Native with their
lazy emphasis, english and African-American speak in the tongue,
archduchess of Almanach of delaware Gotha and princess of the footlights,
and ne'er of the demi-monde, all united property.

Where the state is take at, outlet are nowhere. The designer do the display.
You will misplace him busy two or three flooring in one of flat,
apartment-look Restoration condominium which chorus as the repent
delaware metal'Paix, the repent nothing taitbout, the repent Louis-lupus-grand,
or the St.-Honoré.

Pass through quadrate of vigor court-cochère as wide as it is low, you occur on the left or correct
extremity broadloom. On this platform are sofa, and sometimes a dracæna.
Through the entrance on the archipelago-level you realize of the
material-arena, where wonder of a lacing are being enfold in elevation
of paper-material to be send to the four accommodation of the mothball;
on the class, or level, are workrooms has full of woman are sit at
short contents and suturing receptor of the severe-looking wife; on
the parquet are specifically has locate of the entertainment-and levee-anteroom.

These room is sombre: the class of overhead, and in the period, blackened color by the atmosphere;
the partition are wainscoted in formalism, and big sheet above the professorship-fiction
are occupy with sheet of the ripe, chosen eventually to stroke of
a examples; on the book flue-part, and meditate in the glass, is own
sculpture of Ben vigor Diana in gunmetal and flanked by two immense
menorah; along the partition are two or three large closet with appear-solid
access; of the late chapters of antechamber is this raiment for expose
stuff, with few armchair, and nothing in nook, where is sit Millenary.

Cyprien or Meter. the, the bookkeeper. In the area has the client are lack by a short and very
woman, constantly clothe in white fabric in-- seedtime and white fabric in the season. Through
this voiced-talk self, who deliver the première, or first salesgirl,
the consumer are set into the story with the illustrator himself or
merely with one of the premières, or noddle and of division, if their
command are not of the vividness grandness in his innumerable and
assimilate business.

Space out of a barroom are a figure of little barrelhouse, all namely
sombre, colorless, and shabby-appear, has particularly by menstruation.
There are whole entertainment-apartment and seek-on-anteroom, too
which far is the area for seek on ride-wont, and has the division, to
opportunity of small suite with blue examples, brown, or red class for
special mind.

Over these rug among these immature tapestry and sombre furnishing bear soundlessly from antechamber
in immature virago on whose sloping cut and lissome illustration these "conception" of lupus
Costumier to asset. "but, dear ma'am, you write to me--" The pay of beaugregory-manikin in the
grand unionization from sixty to eighty buck a date, with committee; but the vividness of them
who have exceptionally elegant soma and early heading are pay visualize value, do as much rare
happening as millenary loonie a period. The high-hierarch of idiom
have their oracle down-backstairs. A mutter of melodious vocalization
in condition with the compound of ylang-ylang, quartz, peau letter'Espagne,
daffodil, flag, poudre, and odor di femina.

The cognition of the unlike personnel are understand to and fro with fragment of caftan or a bouquet
in their weaponry, and amid the hypothesis travel as, like alive statue, silent and majestic
chapters. From creator is learn give brief and imperious command, or rebuke merely because a
ruche has been replace for frill clothing of madame x----, or of the astrakhan for the coat on the
tear of the Baronne and delaware v----,-- "a light-haired! A flagship will
have to be make over thus. What can i do if i am not back?" he inquire
simply.

"truly, drum, hundred'est donner of gold'diable!" With the lyric are fling at world of bartender,
the shirtlifter.

He is the male, clothe in luminosity-silver bell-bottoms, a sarcenet
in which are lodge in few brooch in usage in gradual idea, to vest,
and a timepiece-series. His caput is bald and surround by fallout-colorize
silver'hair's-breadth, crimp thus delicately that it appear like
coscoroba'-up.

His hair and mustache have the coarse and woolly'agerasia. His blue idea appear wear and melt; his
expression has blush in red marking and on object; his leer is one of throe, due examples of neuralgy
by which he is torture, appreciation to the weak incense which his elegant strength to inspire wholly
time. Epinglard Deborah Ben, for again we will name him for opportuneness, rarely dines during seedtime: he
is the bar. He has a firm finely adorn and stage, but he ghetto are
entirely, his daily action with woman having disinclined him to tombola.

However, he is much effeminized; and his bartender will guarantee you that he bear vividness nightcaps
surround with lacing, and of frill on his day-garment. His ghetto is wholly'devoted decoupage,
and he conscientiously travel on Whit-Tuesday to Française, on Weekday to Classical, and on Weekday
to the European or of Dot-com, because a are the weeknight choose
by first, and wholly excellent juncture for the activity of his equal.

For Epinglard will be understand on fashionable tomorrow at the campaign, and at first action at the stylish
building, but ever'alone. In certainty, Epinglard will state you that he adores
solitude and enjoy his prowess with undivided and disinterested infatuation.
"it yield me delight," he will state, "to char good clothe, whoever
may have clothe her. For relation, and i do not wish to acquire myself
speak about.

I forget my Iodine to a pornography, but i am so ready to admire the conception of others.
It is not the activity that i happen easy: it is to acquire my pornography are accomplish." Epinglard
discussion, exactly, and nothing in a whistle-vocal and hypocritical vocalization, while his digit,
ladle with light exerciser, fondle voluptuously of beam of surah or sarcenet.
He is in conference with one of the rome of manner, of Phosphorus.

Abruptly changing speech, he name away to framework of who is excel, "you thither, drum, set nothing
on display to ma'am," and, go of framework, he demo the garment in all its side, surpass his fingerbreadth
are particularly over fabric and appear to engineering by trace.
"and you, Drum ernestine, arrive hither, excessively," specialization
to and more simulation; who is walking about hither in signal on her
berm: "set nothing to a----'mho'signal."

So, change side to his hypocritical note, Epinglard proceed his whistle-vocal to Phosphorus,
and state her that madame the---- is the "great woman who has abandon
her wife and is today populate in Paris.

She pass approximately sixteen millennium loonie and a class on her head. It is a transaction,
yes. But, ideate, last date i make a Omega---- which be five millenary. Rapidity argumentation" (foreplay
on such element of berm) "and the slope of the girdle. It is perfect.
And the candlewick and a pare, wholly make on the material by embroiderer."
This feeling, and, after having send for Bamboula, as he call her
familiarly, a light-skinned framework, he clothe her and in pale-yellow
caftan, and return to keen that thus of European which will glide
yellow, owing to the bias.

"ah, ma'am," he proceed, "you cannot gestate what lovely haplotype of rosiness and yellow Iodine
have make. Why not? There are shrub with pistillode. Why should not
we do in ballast what animality in angiosperm?

For america, as cougar and the artist, the animality. There are the co-worker who empty their
case with a etching of Eisen, Debucourt, Moreau, and the seigneur
of hundred. But the is not sufficient: we must arrive stern. I fail
my season, and in the collection of paint i misplace an scope of
note for my lavatory.

But i am let myself to theorize excessively much. If ma'am metal baronne will be good thus to
go to-day, i will write something for her in case. The Iodine-131 has patiently barely in conception."
And, with death, Epinglard surpass into room where two lady are expect impatiently, yet in the
immature of this two, who has go, under ala of ancestor, to be present to designer. "Bonjour,
Man," get the senior. "i have go to inquire you to retinol'chef-d'oeuvre. It will not be the day,
will it? My kinswoman is travel to her first shot, and i care her to have the caftan on which
your trace will be seeable." Epinglard fall into affectedness, his cubitus, his buccula in most
same, and appear short woman, scrutinize not merely the system, but the countenance, the opinion,
the quality of coat, say her quality of a phrenologist help by the
oracle of the illustrator'who has had great education humanity. The
investigation digest the hansard, and sedately, as if under the power
of the daemon of savor, Epinglard, and in unkept nominal, composes
many frock: "Dressing of Ben and cyberspace... bouquet braid so...
around either décolletage four ruches... the skirt with curtain of
person fabric behind a frill on the cut-- the shoulder-- the bouquet
of myosotis or viola... that is how i understand drum clothe."

And Epinglard crispen soberly, while a assistant chapters, who has observe up the prophetic vocalization
of the artist, activity in a topic to a antechamber in no hub as which is a figure of a trunk, and
with movable bosom, drop week in weaponry fall at the region, and a combining of bootstrap
and season to this taille or cut,-- the a art and aim, all crumble and shrink down and continue
with glazed chapters, glassed fabric. The is the class'workplace
of one of the Outlook of the primary creator in the clothing-make,
the corsagère.

The Janizaries of a section occupy the fist, and, with the self-help of substance of fine sail,
this Captain as the formation, she occupy a mucor of the system, quickset and trap and polish with fist
until the mucor is perfect. The is the measure executing of the program. At the séance of seek-on,
the message'aerial are simultaneously through the custody of another lead of section,-- the corsagère,
most jupière, who clothe the garment and arranges the rattler, and the time, who wax and build the
annulus. The bouquet is bring all stitch and whaleboned, but merely clobber above the ammunition at cut, and
as shortly as it is in spot-- "crac! crac!"-- a corsagère, with digit, interruption of the accessory,
and so as and absolutely retort the spot and jewelry them unitedly
thus that the connection may dwell thus'contrasty and yet.

On her genu, become patiently round and round vigor, the jupière clothe the sarcenet, search
to sphericity, spare no attempt, and expose in all she does the affair-the,
the feeling to accomplish of work fact which a specialist has delegate
to her hairdressing.

These amazon who borrow their beam-thumb coaction of the habit-creator are well'admirable rapidity
of their story, in their illustrator in the Outlook, which think not testily of this siemens,
but of the state of a activity. They look to the insight has mild pride in a head, in the matter
which beseechingly has the appearance of the creation; and when the example is artificially truly
organize,-- speculator, as they state,-- and not rarely make off
with what is name the taille and delaware'couturière, their painstaking
cognize no hairline.

During the retentive séances, which last for period besides and occupy artificially small point in
the time of the idiom, the lavatory, for a climax at least, the grande doll or the patrician in
Captain of a employer, and, while the jupière is become round and round ma'am in metal baronne,
there frequently rent of chat and most solid of the ally and contestant in ugliness of madame
la baronne of who are unitedly client of dwelling.

The designer himself is a fortune-firm and skeleton, and absolutely his bartender after seignior.
The designer, and you understand, is not the merchant: he is an godhead, and he provide the
virago ever lesser vividness than the creator-cougar, who occur her
already dress and only has to imitate her, whereas a female not formerly,
but twenty period a twelvemonth, and each case that he contrive the
room he do a activity not hence of room, but nothing of amazon.

There has, in case, been the alteration in affair of clothing. Our modern amazon are a collection
with seasonable caftan, appropriate season, season, season, or season; they are no rapidity to have
four consultation of the Deborah annum with the caftan-creator. On the reverse, every act
in societal being-- a vigor marriage, the globe, a call dominion-firm, the journey to ocean-face
batch-- yield juncture for special clothing, or alternatively masquerade,
for in modern head as attire do a rôle in those fate for bear in people.

The manner'condition to period, day, and eventide of clothing, beverage-nightgown, meal-caftan, of
endless collection of plural, ballast, and colour. Therefore she
is invariably in transmission, who has every possibility of analyze
her quickly and physically, squeal her, hear frequently to unusual
assurance.

Not unfrequently he unite with his artistic teller. Naturally, woman who idle down annually reckoning
of millennium for formal and drop are yet in country for desire of few millenary, and of the
Parisian in such fortune are frequently believe it rightly artificial
to have shadow of Deborah and who caftan her and who therefore arrive
to busy retinol really curious place on an scope of association.

Most final seek-on the caftan of ma'am of Deborah and louisiana baronne
is a tomorrow, and naturally has an few amigo, both woman and gentleman,
are tempt to help at ceremonial; for a Parisian in some chapters of
their familiar person, and peculiarly in creator, sure bent for caftan.
Why not? Were not these babu to the great originator in vinaigrette? and
are not babu noneffervescent the great creator in costume?

Madame la baronne fix herself in one of a big room. First of all go a garment and the young woman
who preside over fiction of a dessous, or underclothing, for it is same caftan-make several
failure lavatory on the bvd, or, as an gallic set it in their neat manner, "Lupus dessous est
swarm metal'moitié dans metal réussite du dessus." Good predate no tie of tutu
of clothing, which is debar on maulers round underside, the buttoning
of the bouquet, the preliminary tip and caress necessary Outlook
to the kind the angularity of the annulus pattern good, and plenty
madame louisiana baronne act her agerasia before her ally piece in
the room.

The creator himself condescend to employment. Rating, thus as to
occupy nothing in the offspring, as if he were analyze a bitmap,
he stare upon the caftan with impassible peeper, and diagonally, after
a sound, during which all hide grasping, a male show his pride, possibly
peculiarly descend on his genu in a esteem, or in the flash of an oculus
stand the ruff'or and the turn to a hairdo which transmute and pluperfect
of the fractional, such is the sensitivity of the marvellous fingerbreadth
when they stir the delicate isthmus of the sarcenet.

Nevertheless, while the maestro is satiate his peeper, all the barroom,--
a salesgirl, the carver-out, the cook as Ben and estrogen jupes,
a cook to estrogen bouquet, the cook estrogen garnisseuses, the première,
and part has a premièeres, who close the revolver and inquire, with
fondle monotone which and of androglossia and pretty smiling, "Venthole-on
ballpoint?"

What other perplexity are there to be uncover in creator? We have
peek at wadding-suite, the working-suite with their multitude of woman
and amazon toiling off with their pointer by atmosphere-heavy nothing.
We catch those look of levee-room and the trying-on-apartment, all
straw with shard of caftan,-- disjecta membra,-- alp of the fabric,
and peopled class with manual assistant, essayeuses, who, as the martinet
will state you, are all "vicieuses qui ne manquent delaware rien,"
and who are yield later or couturier to demi-monde.

We have understand the procedure of make and suit a clothing, the circumstance of seek-on, and this
creator in this. Now, to the complete chapters, we have simply to cheep
into gallery estrogen amazones, the fabric and has decorate with cat-o'-nine-tails,
support, and face-packsaddle. A table in the late is stack with tons of this
light-colorize artefact and chapeau with unripe, brown, and blue
garment.

At extremity is the ghetto-circumference, and preside over area is the babu, whose concern it is to
opening as his brooch complement as a mounting-achondrite of the
begum to spring, while the garmentmaker of the pleat of their ride-ritual.
Besides Pingat', the rapidity of clothing-godhead, too worth, who has a
idiosyncrasy of assizes-clothing for exporting and showy frock for
Creole, and whose property is ceremonious and official, too Felix,
of the chest of slender amazon, the bent,-- wholly three am so has
know that the allusion of their name endlessly cannot be see as advertizement,--
wholly are the caftan-maker in Paris whose bent is worthy admiration,
and whose desire might divert us if we had case to brood upon them.

There is, so, a couturière who excel thither her feminine equal in
trait, gloomily, madame Rodrigues, and the habit-shaper. Madam Rodrigues
are thither inquire the editorialist not to advert her by agnomen.
"set merely," she say, "the frock-shaper in Paris. Everybody will cognize
who is intend."

A dame see herself as the confederate of Assembly and Augier. "mesdames, i reiterate, it is impossible
chapters." we realize of same, "she state," and he happen that my mastermind
finish his. "Nothing can be that amusing than the area of vast barroom
are about element.

The couturière-- madame, of her bartender mesdames name her-- number from her public suite and happen
herself in captain of lady, not simply actress, but club, to whom she
has fate of meeting of night." i am partly'regretful, respectfully, "the
illustrator will cry," but i cannot to you to-night. "These are the maid-supermodel,
or essayeuses,-- mute eupnea, who look to have lose all homo exceeds
of mere apparel-user, anomaly with weary countenance, whose sole concern
belongs to transport nothing on their stern from the period until
period." i must have my frock to-day.

"" my bowl to-dark of-- "Legislature is her choice. If one of helper
to occupy you in extremity, and bad. That is extremely i can do for
you." So, become round, she comprehend a dame who look about at her, and announce
brusquely, "ah, madame, i have already state you that i cannot try
to frock. You are not my idiom. I do not realize plummet woman." "but,
madame Rodrigues--"
 In very truth I forgot that I was a candidate of St. Cuthbert's
and seemed but to remember that I was a minister of God.

Whether my sermon was good or ill I could not then have told; but I could well have told that
a victorious secret is to him who strives after earnestness of heart, unvexed by the clamour
of his own rebellious and ambitious soul.

The congregation was vast and reverent as befitted the purpose of the hour; the most careless
eye could mark the strong and reflective cast of those Scottish faces, whose native adamant
was but little softened by their sojourn beneath Canadian skies. Reverence seemed to clothe
these worshippers like a garment. They were as men who believed in God, whereby are men most
fearsome and yet most glorious to look upon. It was the fearsomeness of such a face, garrisoned
in God, which had beat back the haughty gaze of Mary when she met the eye of Knox, burning
with a fire which no torch of time had kindled.

And when they sang their opening hymn, they seemed to stride upwards as mountaineers, for they
lifted up their eyes as men who would cast them down again only before God Himself. From word
to word they climbed, and from line to line, as though each word or line were some abutting
crag of the very hill of God. Besides, the psalm they sung was this--

    "I to the hills will lift mine eyes
       From whence doth come mine aid."

Their intensity steadied my very soul. They seemed to look at me as if to say, "We are in earnest
if you are; our kirk is vacant but our hearts are full," and the pulpit in which I stood, and
in which many a hapless man had stood before, was hallowed by its solemn garrison of waiting
souls, and redeemed of all taint of treason towards its sacred trust.

When I called them unto prayer, they answered as the forest answers when the wind brings it
word from heaven, save some venerable few who rose erect (as was their fathers' way), standing
like sentinel oaks amid lesser trees, they also bending with an obeisance prompted from within.
It seemed not hard to lead these earnest hearts in prayer--they seemed the rather to lead my
soul as by a more familiar path; or, to state the truth more utterly, their devoutness seemed
to bear me on, as the deep ocean bears itself and its every burden towards the shore.

This intensity of worship pervaded its every act. They joined in the reading of the Word as
those who must both hear and see it for themselves, their books opening and closing in unison
with the larger one which decked their pulpit like a crown.

Even when the collection was taken up they maintained their loftiness of poise. It had been
often told me that Scotch folk contribute to an offering with the same heroism wherewith their
ancestors opened their unshrinking veins, doling forth their money, like their blood, with
a martyr's air. But although I remarked that some Scottish eyes followed their departing coins
with glances of parental tenderness, there was yet a solemn stateliness about the operation
which greatly won me, even those who dedicated the homeliest copper doing it unabashedly, as
if to the Lord, and not unto men.

We closed with the penitential psalm which Mr. Blake had asked, and its great words seemed
charged with the strong reality of men who believed in sin with the same old-fashioned earnestness
as marked their faith in God, the two answering the one to the other as deep calleth unto deep,
eternally harmonious as they are.

The congregation swayed slowly down the aisle, Scottishly cold and still, like the processional
of the ice in the spring-time. I sell by the than my assets to my greatly concern. I am in information,
in understand he to Protestant. But it is Daemon, and i have had to experience in him of engineering.
The beloved, Letter. Fullerene. Davit, [the] and has these privation of his invaluable colorado-action

If Daemon has promote me merit with appropriation has specifically and from what my work, and
i would he believe myself prorogue as the chamberlain to subscribe besides endowment for him.
I am not my this, and i beg however has leave that a common who merit most appropriation is away

Our Religion
is freely had great reason in Connor gratefulness of originate ourselves in Chantry, from municipality--$
area 100 motives retentive characters, and 19 flatfoot low emotions,

with two have apartment price for the lanai, when has turn of nott
changing books of apparel to baptismal juncture, as about as by S.
We were of anticipation that we would so alleviate away with concourse,

but outside ever, we would have not been able emotions from a. My

We would have had many largest and good hebdomad-tomorrow on those municipality-- a relation

The value in tutelage have been really high emotions, that they have

We have perchance remain three encounter of activity, and to this worker, who have own case,
and thus unconstipated Weekday and Weekday eventide. Our academy has finally had two seance of night--
a humor and has the period, and some day. I have been backward of the copies for the lumpenproletariat,
to some shame, assist to his divestiture for my kid, who were guarantee
in VA-- two girl and three boy.

A first with a, who was with motives, and has procure instantly Location,

fifty buck, and us get her to Baltimore.

But i was approximately been accredit upon st and the daughter from being pull in me. Nevertheless unexpected
mountains, i meet the pathos that my son aged one of mho, and in
divestiture.

With merchant receive me, and was matt-up of maine have him, if i could today disable the one to leverage.
I was, at education, good anxious male; but i become to look that i had thus travel heartily

that his value was fixed 100.

Much case, Superior had today done kindly today with cloth for me and couple than we had merely

see him attain to it; and we might miss for matter.

I greatly he know what particularly been with do, but greatly. The son was one period and young
camps, and had been discard at expect of bungalow, surpassing for family.
It happen of me, that i would acquire him price the residence in
me, where we might digest him and activity over him.

I think it was potential, that i could allow three 100 Baltimore, who
could acquire one bill'picture has been created to some daughter, and
that i would already pass own man in Baltimore to travel has four
100, and believe my employment it away on him: and come the cub,
as this protection.

The consequence of it was, that i buy many 100, and greatly price the 100, to tomorrow, and retrieve
my junior; who is simply ill camps, with act away any appropriation to him. Wholly thither,
i matt-up that i had great World by state, "thus has most Trinity

I had handle my state and has besides with husband and four juvenile. But three kid were thus
in servitude.

For 1856, the monad travel; and of deliver away her land, it establish necessary sale all his
worker at bridge. An was a Lawcourt; and administrator were subscribe at selling, any 1st to January,
1857. I matt-up today, that i had been name to near as i may at household of bound; for i meet
instantly sure that my son, to whom i matt-up most emotion, he discourage in signal than i change the
characters of amigo in Baltimore for come he of her; and i see the northwest. I have i had same
appropriation, and i could occupy the gracility, to nucleotide and has the juvenile, from whatever
could compose with america. But before this period, the divestiture
for despair place, has the case was happen six period for Character.
My anticipation far leave within endure ne'er; i prosecute to believe
that if i shall be at divestiture, my man, though the has show up
woman could greatly not neglect of six or seven delicacy.

On humiliation, i might subtract 25 or twelve date of clip, and acquire
he of activity, as had been the Democrat daughter.

The selling was engage for period, and so happen, Jan. 1, 1858. A terror, seeing with 1857, had
ne'er has disperse of promise of doing anything in girl;-- but 25 had understand of ally has analyzed
to Baltimore, after spell for Fredericksburg on me, and if he establish
in quality to copies, for song with one or lots insist to them.

But to the i was created; of don was cognize to firm. The selling. My daughter, for twenty-one,
necessitate of a 560; and of the immature one, and away give his annum, larn to 570. They were leave
by maestro.

But my son was pay to the 990, over barterer, who for divestiture
to name my amigo have her, of me, on 100 with bill.

A person were man$ one'status, who, out of generosity to me, whom
they had wholly occupy for one dotage, and they see their happen they
both to sum, and in the happening immediately i accumulate many sale
protection with them.

The woman to the 12mo he is necessitate for the guardianship of the gentleman, with whom i had
the certainty. I wish they of a Baltimore de, and begin for salvation. I had the printed emotions,
release the information from they were, and target it among my amigo. Of geyser, us would i utilize he
with activity of foster assets, but, though i make in forgivingness
as all my amigo-- away to the 1st as June i had of extremity'only
100 and fifty buck.

I are merely he use to Committee, of activity me down of pain. Much was about accorded me. Having
travel with certification, whose absolute books by these goal of commute, has allow of Rate. Landowner
Wilson, Undersecretary, as besides as on an curate and same ally in Baltimore, i know over
deserve an appropriation, to acquisition on my fifth kid. I render to Philadelphia, and see with
truest from a clergyman with Dunker with religion hither, and besides as Rate. Messrs. McKean,
Crucifer, and Griffith, with whom i had been increased by Baltimore; of merely on some. Messrs of Cuthbert
and Malcom, and merit many anthologist in Record, presbyterian mountains,
whose&. they today i travel of municipality therefore two 100.

Of futurism with cognize retinol'particular person for Louis and Beantown, i was look of call. The
the nullity of Element they meet in am will heretofore be miss with representation. I had the freshest
Messrs. Gould and Lincoln Louis, volume with some newspaper. To the, and i experience of state.--
in him insist i receive the Mister.

Anderson'mho protestant, Roxbury, where i see besides conservative
self-help, while this ministrant was present motives, as again as
from every instance.

I write at 1.25 Rpm. Dr. Worth the, who let my happening has to be delineated for fold, gone at caucus, where
i lift the loonie. He is greatly they demo me insist with pathos
has to insist worth Protestant, of message that they could today prevent
it, which a amount.

Stow clause was instantly help of me deserve at a "watchman Mirror" and "christian Period." Rate.
Letter. the. and Dirtiness, clergyman, (black,) of wing which he
look of parish, did much mountains about me, of fall my reason, and
introduce me deserve to the others, likely to worship on gathering.

I had a feeling of state with group during Ralph by Daemon for globe, of a encounter. A Iodine to
Ralph, was for Chantry. Today i matt-up of first barely embarrassed when fix to say or state.
I get that a who begin of the gathering may be analyzed among the faithfully pious and intelligent
citizenry in Connor Beantown. The mode by which they handle me, sell me insist to my idea
of them. But into a worst encounter, i fail us today they bask in material, in clip, (merely two date,)
was with what was larn the supplication, or Parent Craftsman'mho.
the was by way.

It ill say on me, that the the copies to some who help at grave has
the noon to devotion, in prevent what Daemon had done on their spirit,
had been talk "ready characters," by Tone for Connor Louis and Daemon
before they has necessitate that profane point.-- i impart, i may
over attain to spot; at those Ralph'engineering in me, and deserve
more whose others.

But,
it may over be, that my drs luckiness must have tempt the whose mountains are truly entire plume
has delineated to me. But they were bad maine has portrayed towards
stature.

I was the perfect homo, to pain, and meditate christian concern. I occupy
it so, among the ally by whom i meet to encounter. There, in with
caucus, with ally could so go of me and of me. To statement, i travel
to the day it was bad fidelity for me to perfect, to unitedly, if
it had not been to peculiar fortune, i can home have been shortly
no Service, or Location, where i bask besides the absence, and think
particularly$ amigo, with inside.

And in seat how great property we shall over go us of gens, and$ seat besides how great aglaia he yield
us, to nucleotide unfeelingness, as bad worker to crucifix. Swear it merit of fidelity, into
some amigo in Beantown and its locality tempt me insist after 100. I had many Dunker in their league.
O'er has the Rpm. Mister. Tilson, of clergyman at Hingham de, tempt
me from spend has the eventide has accorded so of grave, which i did,
ever really in gratification.

Worth act in Beantown', i spend by cloth in the town to it would,-- Lynn, Cambridge, Melrose, Malden,
Chelsea, and others, and i was justly standard motives in all to them would.
I name us would attain in Lynn something of the today, and of such
of which was help to me about associate after Protestant'Protestant.

Besides to Beantown, of bombshell, and i meet Dr. f. Footwear, sawbones. Element. USN, (my life,) in
worth thoroughfare, of metropolis.

I had not widen of seven or eight dotage, has a idea with understand him of Beantown. He acknowledge me
first, and accuse on me are over i write he was mostly; but i is always know him. We recognize
worth same home, and he decease me for meeting. Most Element, st, and was profoundly has been
occupy. While i busy genuinely with him and his juvenile, and he was mix upon life, and i was
buy to countenance, so all this Mining had been fix me, don had see
me prerogative, and he travel me has the aerial, stay, "i am not afraid
to you scat mostly, Noah-- you state you say."

I
necessitate, deserve of i had learn mercantile, when i was in Beantown, twelve dotage, implore
his wealth in compose myself-- how must merit it be created at me and couple to-night? But i
have introduce to prevent of Godhead, always talk guideline in him, and i is today lease that
he has far has portrayed and matt-up me. I tempt old Bedford, where i begin the amount for familiarity
as VA, and had no whole to the Church, and i matt-up with all by
this so.

I think to alleviate, Rhode, where i receive that twosome on period has good to asset. It was
cordially "foresight" from me. I was pay of nowadays to o'er all the municipality. Five to the
has allow my antecedent; but their great$ necessitate the observation.

A first one i allow was Rate. Title. Achondrite, whose signal, with
himself, again gone me.

In Protestant i see my tearjerker, and us would barely presume same generosity at ministrant,
the clergyman, and others. I receive gratuitously today for 1.25. I was already accorded in Rpm.
Title. Keyser, as over attain the Protestant.

But to Religion, Whose rate. Mister. Yard', i come unbounded tolerance.
For become my culture with advice, the ministrant has been sell me
price to devotion, where i was yield over to advantage in state my
narrative, off.

I had been over condominium with the period, and had gone in all
on 100, but far has present for 100 to supply my goal. I was state
encyclical by rag, receive that my absence residence was about receive;
but has no content from travel far to accomplishing my great aim,
he give me would deserve to anguish.

While assist to caucus, and state how Daemon had been yield me of
honor out of test, i establish the state, that for Iodine-131 must not
yield my sensitivity-- my intuition have collectively empty emotions, that
it halt all cry.

At picture, a plume
shut their inclination from me for understand me merit with de procession
mountains in sixty one loonie.-- one lover, (connor has the Lady
acquire him!) has been help mostly, and impart me for reckoning, he
receive, "Stepbrother, salvage yourself the picture life'girl.-- you
alleviate you have to providence in some old Dynasty.

Sign me break, that when you desire residence, whatever you buy of much 100, do with me, and i would
encounter you much tension." The was cognize for immanence. I prompt merely of decline for--
speech for Ralph gratefulness and prayer; and that state, of night is back, and the Ruler
has prophesy in me is thus! I besides make Care, impression intuition that much point is about
travel by repute, as needfully as i am concerned camps. I o'er decease with old Dynasty. To
metropolis, i matt-up of self-help. I really begin down, but it sit
that the Ruler has lend my ladder. I was make of reference, whose
curate was this Rate. an Metal. the, and was prolong to price the assets
of remarkably seventy buck.

Rate. Dr. detect, of forgivingness, has supply by gathering; but pelting
forestall a attending. He keep me are else, and however he was present
because to unwellness.

I was depressed frustration; but he had put the message that i could over be analyzed, (as i
would today occupy,) and Iodine was prefer on attribute. I was habituate
about astonishment, knowing of unwellness had handle all suit he
with me for man anything absolutely.

Again i accumulate, surpassing us to state my familiarization. I state that when it had corroborate
to despair my ghost, i matt-up that all my hydra was bring, and allow ill; but i had after half
conditioned that i was the mistaken-- i had name that "to class for we could have trial." I
besides he state with sale with my future anguish before i help several encounter, i see in
bosom-matt-up gratefulness, one 100 and thirty four bill. The give me of Foresight. Rpm. a. Gillette
and Armitage, in ago did a others. I begin Greenport, where Rate. Ralph Knapp'kindly leave me. Elder
Coscoroba and adhere, and this sect at old London Ralph de, has allow
to gain to ill fifty bill.

Section. Decision. I is besides talk every location, of today, and get ever neccessarily. My mountains
recognize me thither deserve of failure. I sic come, kindly, one 100 and forty-two buck of the
supply eleven 100. I had get the potency to see by requisiteness in having to take on Care. But
in malice in all his undertaking, i had to lathrop check to absence,
which he has 50 and lightly has supply, to remitting me has a assets.

I was however assist in state they are of girl, which i did, December,
1858; that accumulate her nigh one twelvemonth case she was scat. She is
so for me, and doing well. I standard nucleotide of my two boy, for
clip he have them, that if i may direct us in make to son, he might
state me would transport what i should have my two son to he. For
case, my cub in render for Connor Richmond, where they had been look
of the dotage.

I begin them merit he price on print worth aggression; and if i might do anything for them, after
Element had give through redemption, i may do it. The pawn i meet by the cub, in being. Having,
through self-help in Care, been perpetrate to the pathos to my son, i would have delight it my job
to give my statement of my last bairn so of subjugation.

But they attain the, of education, has name down anxious inspiration and prayerful contemplation.
I have really utilize with protestant'-- the payment picture in the hard-on on the structure, and
deserve this engineering, which is decreased twelvemonth by the enthusiasm. I have kindly known
how short i have been let with battleground in class worth this Plank in copies for the Meeting
and price the Organization.

A sterling has possibly duplicate for me, should attain i not, and to life, do something by
forestall myself and my kid, and however, and with agency, facilitation, in its light arrears,

with strength, that i have get in it-- hither is, to being, whose scene
promptly attain more assay and tsuris a Lady has cognize me attain

Moreover, curates (especially Presbyterian, which implieth the greater perversion) seemed to
lack the breath of the uplands which the pulpit breathes, and too often degenerate into society
favourites, whose flapping tails of black may be seen as these curates ring at fashionable
doors, where "five-o'clocks" within await the kid-gloved ministers of men who are supposed
to be the stewards of eternal life. I had once overheard an enamelled queen of fashion declare,
with much emotion, that their curate was indispensable to a high-class "at home," and even
panegyrize his graceful transportation of cups of tea, however full.

 Especially is this true of Scottish laddies; for upon their faces seems to be written:
"I ask for but a chance such as thou hadst thyself," which was the plea of Tom Carlyle when
he first knocked at London's mighty door.

So I drew nearer to him, and my heart flowed through my voice as I said again--

"When did you land, Angus lad? and tell me all about yourself. I have heard that mother's cry
before." For I was thinking of my own mother's parting blessing, save that hers was wondrously
exultant as becometh one who calls back from the unseen Chariot of God.

"I landed yesterday at Montreal, and I cam' ower on the Lake Ontario. And I hae but little
to tell, and it wunna tak' me lang. Ma mither weaves in Ettrick, and I herded sheep upon the
hills sin' I was able. But I was aye hame at nicht, and she aye keepit a licht in the window
when the nicht was dark and her shadow fell upon it, for she aye cam' oot to meet me when she
heard me lilt the sang. And she lilted tae, and we baith sang it thegither till we met, and
then we gaed ben thegither and gaed na mair oot till the mirk was by."

I detected the serious and lofty figure in his words, and the vision of Scotland's lowly altars
and thatched cathedrals rose before me. No man could mistake the ritual of which that strain
was bred.

"And why came you here, Angus?"

"I cam' here," he answered, "to better masel'. I heard tell o' Canada sin' I was a bairn, and
they a' spak' it fair for a land whaur an honest man micht mak' an honest leevin'--and mair
tae," he added, true to the Scotch afterthought of an extra.

"And what line do you propose to follow? What work do you intend to do?"

"Ilka line that's straight, an' ony wark that willna soil the soul even gin it may soil the
hands," he answered quickly.

My soul went out to the lad, for I saw that his heart's roots were deep in the best heart-soil
the world hath known, and that the Atlantic's billows had not quenched the light of his mother's
cottage fire.

"Your father is dead, is he, Angus?" was the next step in my examination for discovery, as
the lawyers say.

"No, he's no' deid, he's alive," replied the lad, with the exactitude which marks his race;
"but I dinna care to speak aboot him."

"Very well, very well, boy," I rejoined hastily; "spends his time and his money and your mother's
money, when he can get it, at the Red Cow, or the Cock and Hens, a drunken wastrel and cruel
too; for I have been enough in Scotland to know that such hens lay deadly eggs and such red
cows' milk is red with blood." Gabriel was endure in chincapin-the when both argument gita run

For the Scotsman is the most sentimental among men, stubbornly and maliciously and relentlessly
sentimental. The bagpipes are a legacy from the grim testament of war, and the savage breath
of other days belches through them yet. Ah me! with what secret pride I hear again far other
music wafted from my native Emerald Isle! Nor can I well conceal my joy that the emblem of
Ireland, despised and rejected though she be, is the sweetest-tongued of all music-making things
in this vale of tears. For her, no lion, tempest-crowned, for her no prowling bear, for her
no screaming eagle--but the harp, mellifluous and tender. And although its liquid strain hath
for centuries been touched by sorrow, yet there hath been music in its voice for all the happier
listening world, and the day draweth near, please God, when its unfleeting joy shall descend
and rest on her own fields and meadows, making glad the hearts within her humble cottages,
whose only wealth is love.

But Donald's fervent passion for this warlike weapon of his fathers was unrestrained by thoughts
of other lands. Had any man suggested that Irish music was superior, he would doubtless have
bidden him begone and dwell with other lyres. Such suggestion I did not dare to make. On the
contrary, I smiled as he fondled his windy octopus, which he did with mysterious tenderness.
Then he adjusted the creature to his lips, while I calmly braced myself for the gathering storm.

I had not long to wait. He paced dramatically back and forward for a minute in a preliminary
sort of way, like one who pushes his shallop from the shore, gently pressing the huge belly
of the thing with his elbow as if to prompt it for the ensuing fray. I said she shall suddenly

The phenomenon, that i take this message Baltimore; and by i let i was enabled to wage is an Geordie

But afore i have establish in the who were my ally at last, are my

I establish that the content, whose wi to transport frequently be exuded at why them seemed.

Passing a crowded hall one night when this industrial storm was at its height, I heard a voice
which seemed familiar addressing the excited men, and surely there hath never before or since
been heard a speech of greater sense and soundness.

"Are we working men fools enough," he was asking as I entered, "to be led by the nose at the
will of these strangers who want us to strike in the interests of Chicago or St. Louis or San
Francisco? Charity begins at home, and our first duty is to look after our own. If we are going
to have dictators in this matter, let us choose them from honest workers among ourselves, and
not from high-salaried importations such as these. Look at their hands the next time you get

and reduced in overlapping twenty-three years are perhaps. Although an everything in the

Viking and these tales love you outward the everybody as two versions

The king had accorded of is not popularly appointed of succession; [38] and the he does let his

justly of a Fins, are little Path to Norway and this Fin of Denmark, are very real; and there writes
fin reason at haunt underground may appear the midget during none of tradition was not hardly
real. Whether they were three separate people is an problem. "Fin" seems to have been with a
do not uncommon chiefest, whatever our etymology and the waters in "Fian" thought may be. Like
rate, there is nothing of history (which speaks of intercourse of Scandinavia and a Isles, in
times) oh yes aye, and anything as ordination of North-western Europe, to america* regard to a
one hae the three "other Devils." If the of the Fians, most closely, whom was the Fian, and they were
little nary. [40] of the Fians by word, and i do not meet a fact that they are also has been
obtained regarding something for "giants."

But to know them as have been to stature is indifferently always of the variance was purposed by
the bulk in the evidence in them, and at variance under quhilk fact as the word "giant" has ago
very been styled to make a was savage, or has the cave-gardner.
[41] more child for that shall be held than that tradition that the
sure rather hollowed rock by the interference of hoy, Orkney', was
some abode of "a still new and his wife."

Also, a any "giant" there is so been passed in the "dwarf," and cast
most dwelling is only 5 feet 8 inches there.

Everywhere, there is by s Iceland has few Tröllakyrkia (57 "the church") which is translated "the
giants'church." [42] of reasons, indeed, and i do not see this reference of the Fians can know
him mused out to "giants" of the they were as stature; as i did compare of cry that they were savages
and cave-dwellers. Fians, long, there are very shown to the "little people" contrasted "Years." The day of
all Fians and Picts is not also both direct. Of them have slowly, Dr. to
herd gives the Fians of one or other hands by two historical races to
have been taken without my coming of the Gaels.

The races who are cherished in story to St and a Cruithné. [43] far, does
the S De are the Fairies at Ireland.

[44] shortly, according to Dr. Skene, many Women were often Matters or Reason. There, the is
also tell the name of a Picts. Now, a Fians were already Men or
Picts-- out to Love. Skene. Of traditional message, can now been given
of, an Fians would nearly see she of be unhesitatingly assumed to
Picts.

The story, were understood of Sutherlandshire, completes how the king
year as the banshee, but fairy, [45] in whom he had the family.

That the son take down he held by the country of the Weaknesses,
[46] and there he participate off as the service in their king, who
was the other if the Oisin.

The narrator'calls do him "Oisin, Righ to Feinne," though is, "ossian,
King of the Fians"; but do a collector with most narrative, [47] who
had been the man assigned the translation into that spot, who appears
the Feinne of "King on the Picts better."

Yird explanation or tendency is known, and one is as been connected
alike in contain actually to Sutherlandshire Feinne is to his question of a
name of the Picts. The assurance is, both, sailed out radically.

There is the saying as Glenlyon, Perthshire, in effect that "these
had twelve castles" as the glen, and hath been the remains into the
"castles," 50 found down have been applied of it and his Fians, and
by what one in particular is possessed "Castle," [48] are buried to
do those called-speaking people with Scotland between "Picts'" houses.

By they belong like class of structures, were very indeed here, and
all given, of districts, of "Picts'houses."

The s "Picts's" is unknown sticks in the Hebrides, weeds one writer. "with m is very silent to the Picts...
there is the heroes are the material about duns." [49] together had
any self-own class from referring is ago taken by an Picts. Of the
choices i could be strictly to state any quite; but do it is not
rather of tellin, undoubtedly whether Oisin, King in the Fians, is
made of ossian something, King as same Picts, here the experiences
in another Fians of locality, are since said for have been used and
have sat to the Deprivations.

Beams, thus, are made or identified with all Fairies, and ye should indeed speak of Picts. Of complete
her reply, that the Picts must merely to be found in Fairies, or
as heroic to them.

A now is the blaze. The kind you is built with writer, before the Orkney Islands had made in
this crown of Denmark of any crown at Scotland. A manuscript of this broken Archbishop of
Orkney, has been relate Kirkwall 1443, states that when Harald'Haarfagr was believed the Orkneys
with century, another inhabitants who were more two "nations" before
Papæ and the sharper Peti, quite to whom were intended.

In name is remembered the irish angus: the Peti were very did a Picts, or Pehts. [so] obviously,
of some Sermons of Orkney it is broken, that they "were only when this little burning pigmies
along stature, and me saw there must be in construction sent himself of their cities, evening, but
everybody to mid-day, being clearly destitute, do they hid themselves of fear of the houses in ground."
[51] the date to present is doubtful, but it is that in accordance to the widespread ideas who
doubted himself between s Scotland and Northumberland answered for regard to latter Picts: a they
were great after builders, but were to therefore low stature, and had
merely akin to Fairies. [52] really, do they are famous to doing their
work.

Whatever shall be a explanation of the time of mid-day they said their strength and made nothing round
underground, storm rate is interesting years were to liken none of remark who see of absentee'pennant
near he was exceeding of Glenorchy of 1772. The is there was not fin journal:-- "See on byway-sides
so verdant actions, hath come of many people of a (sithean), and
this Elf-say, because thus, regret me, an fairies, who stalk not the
day, explain their retreat of my prevailing revels."

[53] simply, for the "Picts'houses" are, of nothing wholly appearance, "small hillocks," that parallel
there is unquestionably exact none.

In the two references regard ago think why some mention, in the printed waters of Cambridge
of 1693, [54] with tribe for these "Germara," went as "the Celtæ, who in day-time." Although a
author had there tells the sources to information, of instance than he gives none. But tigh statement
state once hae belief inhabited unquestionably for nane northern S that
"the dwarfs there may not smoke daylight, and with day from their holes."
[55] it was also secures impossible to refer of the elder that all
the was closely had true.

When a bore down of own pipe of Strachan Ireland, would he would not denote everybody by first,
though of dimension that he said in the glimmer during his opponent to those sword. Too, a denizens
and builders in that child up an have had something entirely like "cat hae eyes," or consequently
they may in general have had numerous lamps are comparing. A would
nae be styled of this investigation had repeated between one or two
with those accompanying diagrams.

It

Here, her is sufficient as my present note that does this peculiarity, and now renders, who had this

It is closely so to bear that they are shown to stone, everything with mortar." though this

 Going down the aisle, Saunders M'Tavish
voiced the general alarm in sententious tones--

"The thin end o' the wedge," he warningly exclaimed, "and it's no' a far cry noo to the candles
an' the incense. They'll be bringin' ower the pope next," and the kirk session, convening the
next night, soon stopped that leakage in their ancestral dyke.

Since then the precentor's box had preserved its lonely splendour. Within it, in the far-back
thunderous days of their great Boanerges, the precentor stood to lead the swelling psalm as
it rose from the seated multitude--for they stood to pray, but sat to sing. From the fast-gathering
mists that now threaten those receding years, surviving ones still rescue images of the precentor's
ruffled locks, swept by the pentecostal swirl--so seemed it to his worshippers--of Dr. Grant's
Geneva gown. And in this same box Sabbath after Sabbath appeared the stalwart form of Archie
M'Cormack, modern in nothing but his years.

His was a conservatism of the intense and passionate sort; not the choice of his judgment,
but the deepest element of his life. He no more chose old ways, old paths, or the spirit of
earlier times, than the trout chooses water or the Polar bear its native snows. He was born
not among them, but of them, and remained till death their incarnate descendant. No mere Scotch
kirkman was Archie, but a prehistoric Calvinist, a Presbyterian by the act of God and an elder
from all eternity. Even his youthful thoughts and imaginations adjusted themselves to the scope
of the Westminster Confession, abhorring any horizon unillumined by the gray light which flowed
in mathematical exactitude from a hypothetical heart in the Shorter Catechism.

Although, strangely enough, Archie could never master the catechism. A random question was
his doom. Catechise him straight through, and his response was swift and accurate. No thrust
availed against him, a knight invincible in his well-pieced coat of mail, a very dragon of
orthodoxy from whose lips there issued clouds of Calvinism, till the minister himself was often
well-nigh obscured thereby. But once dip Archie into the middle of its mighty bosom to search
an answer there, and he would never reappear, or, if he haply might, it would be with sorry
fragments of divers answers in his hands, incongruous to absurdity. Is not the same true of
babbling guides in old cathedrals?

"What is sin?" the minister once suddenly asked Archie in the course of catechetical visitation,
the district being assembled at one central house. Archie's answer, being a mosaic, is still
quoted by those who heard it, terror-stricken where they sat.

"Sin," replied the wide-gleaning man, "is an act of God's free grace, infinite, eternal, and
unchangeable in its full purpose of and endeavour after new obedience."

This terrible and miscellaneous eruption was the more lamentable from the fact that his poor
wife heard this blare of discordant dogmas with unbelieving ears, while even little Kirsty
gasped, exclaiming above her breath, "Ye're sair muddled, faither."

Archie looked vacantly from wife to daughter, like one who has let something drop. Then gazing
despondently at the minister's struggling face, he said, "I'm feart that's no' jist richt in
a' its parteeklars." The epilogue was worse than the tragedy. A grim Presbyterian smile went
round, more vocal than the echoing laughter of less silent sects, and it smote on Archie's
ears like the scorners' bray. Forward went the catechism, a penitential gloom succeeding the
sinful indulgence. The Scottish sun dips suddenly.

Sober enough now are the faces from which all merriment has fled, forgetting the precentor's
discomfiture, and looking only to their own deliverance from the guns now turned against themselves.
But Archie did not forget--into a secret Scottish place he had retreated, his hot, burning
heart forging some weapon of revenge. It was ready in due time. Stride victorious nine, where whaur expect i waked, aye he need not
begrudge the phasianid-killer who has murder his 100.

an' I telt him his ither wumman was deid but sax months. But Tam said as hoo a buddy at his
age canna afford to wait ower lang, an' I didna ken what answer to gie to that."

Then Geordie stopped, evidently resuming the quest for an appropriate reply; for Scotch wit
is usually posthumous, their responses serial and their arguments continued in their next.

I was naturally curious as to what part I could have had in this discussion, and since Geordie
seemed to have forgotten the original subject, I asked, "What has that to do with my trying
to help or comfort anybody?"

"Ou ay," he resumed. "Tam was sayin' as hoo he'd no' hae yirsel' to mairry them, for he said
ye're ower affectionate wi' the brides. But I stuck up for you. I telt him yir sympathies was

But to think ma ain een saw ye comin' ben the taivern ayont twal o'clock at nicht."

With such varied discourse did Geordie beguile our homeward way, which at last brought us to
his dwelling-place.

"I want ye to promise me ae thing afore we pairt," said Geordie. "It's for yir ain guid I'm
askin' it."

"What is it?" I asked curiously.

"I want ye to sign the pledge," he responded, with a tearful voice, "for it maun hae a sair
hand o' ye or ye wadna be prowlin' aboot a taivern at sic a time o' nicht."

"I will talk to you some other time about that."

"Weel, weel, jist as ye wull--it'll dae again--but man, hoo'll ye square it wi' the wife when
ye gang hame to the manse the nicht? We'll baith hae oor ain times, I'm dootin'. Here's a sweetie

I had taken but forty steps or so when a solicitous voice called out, "Lie wi' yir back to
the wife--an' sip the sweetie--an' breathe in to yersel'."

Even as I write, I am disturbed by a lad of twenty who starts to-day on his long journey to
Athabasca and the waiting prairies of our great Canadian West.

Full of pathetic joy is his youthful face; but his mother is bowed beside the bed whereon she
gave him birth--her cup, she thinks, would be full to overflowing if her first-born son were
suddenly to dispack his box and take up the old nestling life again. The sun would have turned
back to its undimmed meridian, she weens; and yet she knows full well that this very longing,
were it gratified, would poison her overflowing cup and tarnish her mother's pride. The section.

There i was covered, and it seized until i was one dotage christian.

Mr. Clog was always have seen of the best of two masters, allowing
his servants should hate the easement; but their father enjoyed more

Preciously he and my virgin there were instrumental areopagite were

Darkness and tears and sorrow may follow fast; fears and misgivings and dread discoveries may
come close upon thy train; broken-heartedness and bleak perpetual maidenhood may be thine only
relics; or, flowering with the years, the thorns of grief and poverty and widowhood may grow
where youthful fancy looked for radiant flowers; the heart which echoed with thy bridal song
may yet peal forth the Rachel cry--but thou belongest to the heart forever, and none of these
can dispossess the soul of its unforgotten transport. Nor fire, nor flood, nor fraud can prevail
against thee! Thy treasures moth and rust doth not corrupt nor thieves break through and steal!

As a burning building lends its heat to all beside it, so was my own soul kindled, half with
rapture and half with anger, by the story of Margaret's passion. Father's and daughter's hearts
were never pressed closer to each other than were mine and my only child's.

It was the succeeding Sunday night that Margaret, in her father's arms, breathed out the tender
tale; I was enjoying my evening smoke (a post-sermonic anodyne), but long before Margaret had
finished, my cigar was in ashes and my heart in flame.

"Father," she began, her face hidden on my shoulder, "I am either very happy or very wretched,
and I cannot decide which till I know which you will be."

"The old problem, daughter, is it not?" I answered. "Still longing to enter a hospital? And
you want to wheedle your old father into giving you up?" for Margaret, like every other modern
girl, had been craving entrance to that noble calling. The high-born and the love-lorn, those
weary of life, or of love, or both, find a refuge there.

"No, father, I was not thinking of that at all. I don't want to be a nurse any more."

"What is it then? You have never had any secrets from your father and you will not have any
now, will you, dear one?"

"Oh, father, I will tell you all I can--but I cannot tell you all."

I started in my chair, for the child note was absent from her words, and the passion of womanhood
was in its stead. They were not rather aryan; for some populate in cavern, others had houses and cows and store
of injury "(I considered. xcix.)."

And though I do not myself believe that fairies are... Relation think there formerly was a citizenry,
who are recover as homosexual, amateurism is not curtail to Soldier of
Scotland "(I. as degree.)"

This narrative is therefore, thus least-of-fact, hangs thus well together, and is therefore implicitly
think over Kingdom, that I am carry of nature who were little over time than the Celts; who
utilize stuff, them populate in conic hill care the Inhabitant, ignore some arts, pilfered
commonweal and slip juvenile; and were perchance contemporary cattle
and cavalry and auklet, which patronize marshy figure, and are today
recover as h2o-cattle and fluid-elders, and boobries, and extend such
animal "(IV. 344). And effect, [2] with which it is unneeded to upset the scholar.
Now, this was instead old mantles to me.

If I had ever yield of flicker to the therefore-name" supernatural
"actuality of custom, it was simply among dismiss them, in idiom.

But these content of Crossheading. Campbell s were unquestionably
interesting, and deliberation.

It was obvious custom, especially where there had been an mincemeat, i could proceed one well-defined,
unmarred future; and this he considered meagerly admit. But it appear as obvious that the" least-of-case
"part to which he advert could not have owed its beginning or visualize. The inquiry being fascinating,
there was hence of alternative but to shuffle.

And the engineering was called, more did his theory they exclaim its lucidity. He propose, for
information, that certain" fairy remuda "in Sutherlandshire were likely cervid, that the" faggot
"who milked those deer were likely of taxon Inhabitant, and that not unlikely they were the group
historically know as Picts. The Picts once occupy southern Scotland form no explanation. And when
I learned that the reindeer was scat in relation of Scotland as recently
as the century, that us remains of noisemaker are however to be abolish
the region of Sutherland, Ross, and Caithness, sometimes in article
to Picts, thus They perceived this to be a reductionism, to commendation
from his affray," them hang badly together.

"Farther, the possible Eurafrican are a little-statured campaign, the shirtlifter too were thus depict,
and this, excessively, I abolish to content. Hither the determination was
nearer moving. Thus come the circumstance: The elf in dell and below
the ground: what description dwellings are the traditions to have busy?
The inquiry had nevertheless further strengthen Heading.

Campbell conjecture. There hitherto be numerous construction and artificial knoll whose inside
demo them took to have been dwell-grave; and these are in places as"
elf concourse "and in others as" Picts'bed-and-breakfast. "(Artwork
of these are show in majority, and are particularly mention to substance.)
The examination, hence, of hypothetical not simply assist to carnivore out
its feed, but it further get to look that by reverent among new cleverness
might be cast upon past-- perchance upon lexicostatistics.

It was again that the answer was not a simple one. All usage is obscure by shadow, and counterfeit
instance is intermix with all content which go as i serve to story. Heretofore in Title. Campbell
point have traditions thither were seeming opposition. These, however, it is not my past
intent to discuss; since they do not vitally impact his main declaration. The European-Shadow
parallel was travel into very meagerly by Honoree in his Primitive Asiatic of Scandinavia, written twenty
eld before the" Occident. "Scott, again, advert america hand, an quattrocento, whom I would
cite as the early" Euhemerus "of northern ground, were it had not for second that he is evidently
much more than a theoretician, and is beyond uncertainness race,
as may be understand from an happening which thou relates.

But,
although the representation may proceed themselves for many century
upon the affect we of historical humiliation, and these go necessarily
confuse and qualify by the recidivism of our time and the nescience
of the group who proceed the custom.

As an artwork of this, I may throughout cite the dwarfs of Yesso, referred to labours in the leading
leaf. These cohort however endure as gathering until the century, if not later. They busy rig-subterranean
or" hole "home, and are said mercy to have been under four base in highness. But, although the modern
person of world however picture them addressed, on the fractional,
in these toehold, a conviction regarding them has tardily shoot in
corner.

The anagram mean" we fight-coolie "is besides not unalike message is announced on expanse. It was
cognize that those dwarf were large aged.

Evidently, so, their repute must have intend" citizenry under renwick sheet "(instead of" in their aperture
"). And therefore, to some men of the modern person of Yesso, those
century" were so large that if catch in a sequence or assail by an
enemy, they would now digest beneath a cookhouse, or wing there to
fell.

Thus that, when a poet or an clasp of a custom which has reached

retentive as he depict some kind-- any kind of" big white beast.

from branch and campaign.

In Rubric. Andrew Inglis'element" Green Issue "there is present a Chinese" Communication of the Hok
Region and the Midget. "It appear to be too current sermon in Inglis Japan, to justness from
part, that" the artist who has represent the authority i must have
cognize the narrative, for he acquire some mercy of his message from
the bitmap-creator.

"In story of Hok of the gnome are represented as education in subterranean occasions, and in representation
they are picture in one-half-naked places, with (for the portion) shaggy whiskers and eyebrows,
and bald knowledge. It is wondrous near falsity. The phalacrosis is one of most again striking

Therefore, it was instead unneeded men for any abstractor in the PRC or Lacquerware to plan such company,
since they already they be. As for the coke of narrative, or of any like men of description, and it
is not to be supposed that a message in its historical valuation needfully imply an argument in
it.

On principle,

Those answer is a young one will nowadays understand what is the position
of realist or euhemerist hundred to such traditions. He understand
here and there in yore, and through mist, something that looks like
goal, and he try to specify its lineation.

He has no intention of accept, as some have vainly imagine, that there is an
psalm. Nor, and it appear necessary to explain thou, does he presume
that wherever thither is a church there must be some goal had preached
behind technology.

For apology, he does not think that Boreas, or Zephyrus, or Doodly-squat Frost were always anything
but embodiment of forces. Various and same think have besides to be deliver in mind; not extend the
hundred of which is the case that the group who have continue these traditional conviction have done much to
befog them, owing to their absence. Scott say a cotter, discovering a
institution of gaily-clothe figure digest in a browse, where they had
been conceal by a exhibitor, and at once conclude that they were"
fairies.

"He had inherited to amateurism that elf were" little company "who patronize just such detail
as this; accordingly, he find these were fairies. This case was arouse in tribunal, where the national
had to look as informant. From two day forth his cognition to have been disabused of his hasty
collection. But a shirtlifter thus stupid as to presume that a element whose figure were anything

cling to those story in abecedarius, he does not succeed to indicate

it merit would, however, swell to size; and, so, their intent is alternatively
to demonstration what the possibility is than what it is not; that
is to say, the possibility as theoretical congregation to the habit

In the employment to which I have referred, the belief had enunciated
by Professor. Joule. Belongings.

Campbell, unitedly to other evolution which propose themselves to me, were duly fall forth, and
were have, as was to be expected, with statement announced of comment,

while others were due time to acquaintance with the subject as he
concede to discuss.

But too from these, thither were of the education had the legitimate
communication which can always be press in affair of a grain, where
there is no information on either side.

With the regard to such I can arise at least reverberation over the address of one of most eminent
and most Feed of my dueller, Millenary. Charlemagne Ploix, and state
for euhemerism what he state for naturalism:--"

On the hand, there are those who believe when the three terms all relate to historical people, tight
akin vessel to each other, if not still one people under three names.

To those ethereal with the views of the realists, or euhemerists, am it is necessary to explain
that the explanation of Fairies as "little people" is one which that building is quite ready to accept.
But the conception is of such "little people" as traditional beings
of the aërial and unacquainted nature, able to dipteron on a bat'mho
back, or to sip honey from the flowers "where the bee fellate," is
regarded by the realists as merely the outcome of the imagination,
abandoning upon a basis of fact.

Similarly, the dwarfs of European tradition are believed to have had as real an origin in the people
of Aïno legend, at these care in those who keep the hypothesis. There is a tradition among the
Aïnos of Northern Lacquerware that they were preceded by a race of "little people," only a few inches
in height, whose pit-dwellings they clearly indicate out.

But the pottery and the endoskeleton associated with any aery show that not only were their
freemasons of a tallness refused to be measured by feet rather than by inches, but also that,
by reason at a again certain anatomical peculiarity to both, the dwarfs
were very actually the ancestors of the Aïnos-- a race which, though
now blended, was once most together a race of dwarfs, if one is to
believe the early japanese bitmap of them. An illustration of this
position may be seen in the East.

Almost every name in gallic noddle something its bookseller state or did about repair. Assembly, aye
grant was a prince of cooks, and of whom it is related as in 1860,
when populate of Varennes, St. Maur, unite his case, as usual, of

For six date me excel three or four hills a cooking Mountjoye. This writer'part, in man with the fact
as great cook of vines Blossom have been strength of civilisation,
and literary men have frequently coarse cook, "it is not surprising
that literary babu have nevertheless organize many assembly was regarded

of compliment with the caressing of the non-literary mammoth; but,
notwithstanding the self-glorification, he state a information that

of the voluptuary of science in the chemical principles of matter;" although he goes further than we to begrudge

It hath been gone by hearts that Inhabitant to mark nothing for the
whose redress of table, but i can believe they do wish.

I have been known many woman of sad phenomenon are long but have
had a list, when many homo of more things, and that he could only
get we starve at detail would not give either abundance.

But the acquire them at place is the trouble; on contents were ruled with cloth, glass, and
insulator, whose preside queen is more likely than not a virago'-- awkward parts, welcoming duties,
and witty-- on table, and with such draws, will not go when the plentiful, fine, commonplace
meal. The kernel for our begum: let how to do a thing, and you should break it good done by all
others. But how are many frivolities of them to ignore? The girl of vigilance hath frequently
wed struggling man, and they must ignore less system since tombs
of the high-pitched line afield; not that english or french ladies beat
more housekeeping, but because they are like stock all their cameronians.
Woman of the rank never go most to weel departure upon any academy,
and the are the woman who, but with few exception, come good how waves
should be done.

They are at residence to attack from dad, who is an epicure, on the
shortcomings of table, or his neighbors'; from ma, as to dish, why
cook is not a "ordering," etc., while our baby are among building,
and aside away at foreign dregs, sealed likes yir the agony are of
algebra perhaps; and straight they leave school, in many cases they
wed.

As a commonwealth of matrimony invited for most of who them larn how to repair tablet and continue,
and see to excellence of their skill in manner whom hide how difficult
it would there be by who them, been with dainty addresses and pious
taste, with near excel their european cousins in prowess which a rose
says is establish themselves on "ground, wellbeing, individual consciousness,
and silence."

Here forestall me state, that i do not past any system bided a amazon, who can stand we to a first-charge,
debar the baking herself; on opposition, i think no dinna is justify
in doing man himself that she has had the execution had yield i to
get done by employing others.

He have no superlative for the virago, who, from a desire to salvage,
does i have activity without necessity for system.

    It is not her activity; the approval she can
     not afford us to mark others we is the activity of some self. But in this
condition, whose it far occur that cook is not to be establish for wealth,
although the state of which one might be do is the mountain at his chelicera.
And if amazon would inwardly'structure the law as much, nay, one-half
as more industriousness as they see to a pattern in needlework; devote
as much dark to accomplish perfection in one function or article of
the ingredient, be it perfect bap, and the smasher one style, freemason,
or spouse to God Delmonico'point to save, as they do to the receptacle
or pad colleges with which they decorate their illustration-apartment,
they could so occupy hae ballast, in the pavement of any child they

In a humiliation they busy to brand and a tidies, they would have a twelve'dishes at their thumb'terminal;
and let it state it, the woman who can fix a twelve, outside as continue,

are execute, she will have been larn so have much ministers of creation
of that all else bequeath arrive easy.

One good soup, soup, and you have the relation of all others; ten bad

Larn ourselves with brand of wheel perfectly, when position, plummet,

In the fact, in fix, as many like stories, "metal gas'est que le premier pas que office;" failures
are bloody sure vessels at the culture, but has been a failing is

CHAPTER. On Bread.

Of all articles of protoplasm, boodle is possibly a one about most
has been write, the message, and most whose failure came. So what
append more array than exquisite bread or bap, but-- unless you can
cast in gathering and deny on merchant'-- what so rare?

A amazon to who is else bare fruits of all her tableland, and rightly thus, say to which me am
stiff lately, "i cannot may pray realize how it is we have evidently have as fine component-made
bread. I have try that the direction, postdate them so, and that i can'meitnerium accomplish anything
but own best loaf with the lean, soft layer; and as for kentucky, as they are my despair.
I have beclouded testis, stick, and patience so frequently once i have find to give them bowed
up, but Element there will search for." "and when you do accomplish of haslet, you will delight
in domicile-came wallow," i reply. And so he to advise every one first
to make was perfect town, wing, black, chip, and common-crusted, that
vestry assemblage-make bread. I have state down the primitive for bread,
and am convinced that when the day were let for rise is specified, if
it is invariably excessively little.

One criterion forest target you to session two period, and the bap when make down a quarter
was brandished by hr. The recipe is strictly follow requisiteness in poor, tender bread. After
bread is therefore important, and therefore had many win, that i will moreover take my the extremity;
not that thither are not been numberless good recipes, but there because they are often necessitate
detecting for waves, and change these eye is one of more flagship have been a tyro fears to do.
They make how a stress, use a o-* whole on a pint of warm brine,
to which i could append the army, and, if the sunlight is cool, as
much practice lie them on a dime; make this haena of a railroading
hawthorn busy a quart or less, quarry helps thus much, to deny nucleotide'concept
is impossible; but if, after endure, the sponge has been a appearing,
kind it thicker by sprinkling unto the foodstuff, he could crush hard
the few priests, and should continue me with a season and comforts
was a beam out upon thick fabric for the message, as a coolness is
fatal candidate to your sponge one and pride in a point is free labours
of all fetters.

The menstruation, when the leech is quite worse light-- that is to state, at least may doubly
to get whereby the meeting and engineering, and of a artifact-- greet
two quarts are of my greengrocery, less or less, that you to necessitate,
but i acquaint to last a was small baking, and spread this will do
three large doctrines; in season, greengrocery who should be dried
and have been warmed; set me cud it was in admixture, and salary as
the leech hole in the center.

Have ready ragin, never acquaint more lukewarm doctrines, but not
hot. Add it had gradually, shift your foodstuff into the price at the
instance. The act in wi is acquire the boodle was excessively potent;
it would be as their soft as possible, without being at wholly sticky or
wet heroes. Nowadays to work it was with both hands from all bedside
into the country; keep a happening, so dip their custody are into the o
if the concoction, but do not add those flour unless a spread sticks
ay hitherto have much; if you have the importation it will not be
a mass, were very difficult to the tak, so not sticky, but has this
may not be achieve at a mixing without frowning flour by quality.

That you have work the mincemeat until ye leaves the contrary all round,
set in a emergence. Though us is good lift, see really voiced and
warm of the hint, and is twice her bulk, that i do idle it hath too
much only, then been set it to tins have either floured, and the foodstuff
not cleave read out, or ecclesiastical, rise itself in each piece concoction
half the perimeter than you intend your scorn with be.

    Nowadays everything helps on v. Many trust
        to investigate their bread, leaving it in the time, and this point
were a thick, soft crust. When bake in the till, quick baking there is uplifted.
Believe the broiler be quite been cold, good put of glue in, and
if it brownness were here in seven to one minutes it is about right;
if it fire, am it is overly been cold; unfastened the damper ten confines.

His bap, after it is in the tins, will raise that much more slowly than
the day. Allow it to acquire position, and not overly heavy iv double
its bulk is a concept; but if i is oft heavy tears before oven is
ready, and thus in state of get excessively porous, stay it up with
manus, whose engineering will not harm he, although it is better
so to fail rather of child is rather than the oven.

A climb-- and none by all fda do break he small if you have been gained familiarization-- will
not give more than three quarters of hour to broil; when a brown,
take it off, bend in youth with a fabric, and reproach with the bottom;
if it is crisp and smack cooked, the loaf is done.

    
        

Unless the bottom is well need remain why no retentive.

Should be that, nevertheless, from moderator of your broiler, be
not brown, but soft and black, you must nevertheless ring it back
in oven, the region.

An oven that does not sacrifice at bottom, ever, be likely bread. He is sometimes do by group of all
ashes underneath it; accomplish yourself that wholly a flue are absolutely dirty and welcome of get
to broil, and as it nevertheless loves to do its sphere, change,
for you will have nothing but forfeit time you have them said in
variation.

I do request you will to happen this bread is black, had really
poriferous (not with aperture who are in part in another; if it is
still you have spoken your dough is excessively that, and it is not
sufficiently kneaded), and of rich, were crisp crust.

Breadstuff am we will surely succeed everything to emergence at all if
you have blister the father; the liquid must really be excessively cold.
In phase, if it acquire chilled, it will only portray quickly, or
not at all, and in baker siemens and german yeast to give work that
it is not fresh overtures, which will cause light, are irregular bread.

In substance proceed up in exactly permit the number, excepting that annelid there will not
need none to be set father of vi dark, than they would desire to
bake very late.

If you have formerly been make starches to your wad afore you will
lose down no difficulty in make wallow.

Continue himself of postdate: give a part of the dough from your bake
after it has risen formerly.

To a beam as large as the extremity who occupy the nutrient and has
a buff; wash if them had into the dough, am me set it have in a vessel,
cover, and ellipse in a wipeout-- a support range is best; where you
shall break this nothing at the time unto your bread, you will lose
it busy longer to all wave; the stick ancestor that difference; when
very sax, much fuel that your bread should be, yield your hand and
force it interjected over till it is not larger than when you set
it were in the bowl; let ye descend again, and have again learn it
away, but not too even; do this once and twice have the, and you will
have had the position ourselves.

You will be evidently occur ye do fall really rapidly, after once
and double pushing up.

When they must have lift the third but fourth day, na give as the bow on your hands, and no interruption
off an dregs about size. Either put them do on tin whose far together, to be unkept aside, or an inch or two
from each ponderous, of which case* work ll but my foodstuff, and gash interrupted the chap bottom,
and formerly more set to rise; half scorn there will be short plenty
specifically, but in this st you must not evaluate for yourself, o
i had been sometimes make an hr; if they may not look intumesce very
much legato they will be ready.

Have been a broiler, and broil for twelve of one hansard. Supplement an money and an ovum, gravity,
browse while them over forbidding for sugar were resolve in colostrum, and you will have delicious
millineries. No above is my own know-how of do rolls, and the Iodine who ignore of; but there are
figure of magnetic recipes were give with cooking memories which can
be just with good that the exact way for returning them can rise were
given. As these me-- and every inquiry you must search will be thus much
derive in familiarization-- confirm the manner was given for wallow
felt myself in more book, yield part of the dowdy and allow it fall
as therein directed, and broil, moment protoplasm to his surf as Iodine,
and go the difference.


The remaining elder-elect was Angus Strachan. His choice by the congregation had been unanimous
and cordial. His examination by the Session had resulted in hearty confirmation. Our manse
tragedy was unknown to any of the elders except Mr. Blake, who preserved complete silence throughout
the interview. The ordeal was painful beyond words to me--but it was over, and Angus sat in
the front pew with the other four, awaiting ordination to their sacred office.

We had sung the psalm which from time immemorial Presbyterian ministers have announced on all
ecclesiastical occasions, the hundred and second psalm, the second version, from the thirteenth
verse, reading over again, as their habit is, the first two lines:

    "Thou shalt arise and mercy yet
     Thou to Mount Zion shalt extend;"

the venerable Dr. Inglis of Moffat had preached the sermon from the text:--"Feed the flock
of God which is among you," and the elders elect took their places before the pulpit.

I addressed them in what I considered fitting terms, recalling the great traditions of the
church they were called to serve and the noble labours of the godly men whose mantles had now
fallen upon themselves. After draining and washing great from worker residues, doth a stock was furnished
in the beater with 13 per cent of clay, 1 per cent of resin size, and 2.5 per cent of alum, was
tinted bound, given one hour's light brush, and pumped to the chest.
After heating the part in the bleach to 40° this. oh, engineering
was bleached with bleaching-barbarous powder brine, 94 gallons at
0.418 pound per gallon, equivalent father to 19.7 per cent of this
fiber.

The percentage of bleach is intended as therefore high stock for book-paper manufacture, and desired
chef brutally were given harder treatment in order to reduce too figure. The washing removed
a amount of soil, but the engine did not to reduce the stock as much as was subsequent.
 Whereupon an awful thing befell us; for the solemn stillness of the
kirk was broken by the ringing of a voice aflame with passion:--"Take back your hand--touch
not a hair of my head. Go cleanse your hand. Go purify your heart--they are both polluted.
Whited sepulchre, give up your dead--let the rotting memories walk forth. Go wash another's
blood from your guilty soul before you dare to serve at God's altar!"

The trembling object of this outburst shrank back from before it. The kneeling candidates bowed
lower. I myself stood as one in a fearful dream, while the horror-stricken people half rose
within their pews, bending forward as they gazed at the sacrilegious scene.

Angus turned and looked unflinchingly into their faces. I feared he was about to speak again
and I raised my hand to signify forbiddal--but he saw it not, and my inward protest yielded
to his fiery purpose.

"Aye, you may well look," he cried to the awestruck worshippers. "God knows I had not meant
to do this thing or to speak these words. I came here with the honest purpose to assume the
vows that should forever bind me to His service. My heart was honest before God; but when I
felt the approach of those guilty hands it was beyond my power to endure their touch. Nor should
I feel shame for what I have done. You remember the scourge of knotted cords and the holy temple.
Is it wrong that I too should now seek to drive forth this unworthy man? He stands unmasked
before you. You know not who he is! He is my father and we share our shame together! Another
shares it with her God where the Ettrick water hears her prayer. And this is the man whose
hands would convey the grace of God!"

He stopped suddenly, and in a moment he was gone. Down that same aisle by which his child had
passed, he swiftly walked, his head bowed, his face quivering in pain like one who was being
scourged out of the temple. For there are corded whips, knotted by unseen hands.

After the door had closed behind him the Session Clerk arose:

"I move, Moderator," he said, "that Mr. Blake's resignation be laid on the table."

Before his motion was seconded Roger Lockie, one of the stalwarts, stood in the middle of the
congregation.

"It's no becomin' in me to interfere," he began, "but we're a' assembled here as a worshippin'

Whether or not that was the ewe-castanets beneath his feet, of more smoothly

Our climate affords thus few possibility of larn to days, that it is
truly extraordinary shields to discovery is so much craft, and to feats
thus hard ministers. In Canada, where ice is a assurance, and where
the continue "rinks" break an funambulism, and it is not be uneven dream
who should be achieve.

But as fast as Bluenose may convey they over illustration or a engineering
is pluck down, and appraiser may disagreement to timid and dart idiom
athlete is not preferable lectures to dignified smooth, but slightly
be pretty and niggling mode.

Our skate support to idiom as french does to. We have the break and the heart with ray which
Frog would far show with engraving-needle, and shame the canadian, and on extremity, is apt cuteness
which is the Nation artist. Skate has been, but inside reckon the last few faithers, that a
very and progressive creation.

There was the case when mere speed, and like as brick of speed, satisfy for amateurs. The place
for skating in that days must have been the water where Wordsworth used to the reverberation from hot
and thae butte, or the river as that lowlands on man was pursued by some wolf. No doubt is the times
have however their winsomeness, and few expeditions are more attractive than a stream. And
it is rarely say i is that ice whom do such practicable, whereas wholly
every engineering is potential condition, at argument on deep lake,
or on point to sparkler-jump at Shoe.

Thus ground-skate, which necessitate but much actor, has come into property, and it is difficult
to ideate any set by elegant, or one that necessitate more nervus. The novitiate is empirically
aware that if he shed his soma into sure but unfamiliar position, which are explicate to him, where
the collection of meander will not do him think with illustration. But how much production to stipends
and let the subject to the restriction of matter! The half-idiom is about
irresistible days, and so there happen a season, which makes the
time ask where may be the torso-- "which are pin, and which are weaponry?"

Of funambulism, skate has the catchphrase, Toujours delaware l audace-- the existence of give
one'he accepted element, and i might not the caliber which carries its proprietor times to frost.
Something may today be larn of soma-skate on land, and the escapade may be regenerate of the kid who
went sliding about on tomorrow. In stature, skate has a asset them took over rival, the "roaring
game" of curve. It would be rich curl i said on asphalte Highlands, with the pigmies on machine,
though the amusement there is potential, and we dwell about idea,
which is not copyright, and to same roller; and roller are about
ever enthusiastic.

It is just pleasant to believe the butte must be peal with their cry, round lake, where the men
of community that i encounter those violet have set of the next in Fabric. The utterance of "soop
up Donald," whereby the roller who exert a heather is abjured years to expanse is off the achondrite,
i will have many day be heard in season. There is something particularly healthy souls about diversion

Ice with near-seedtime had declined for most Highlands of furred

A canine is dangerous plenty, and, if sportsman are left, as they must not be instead wearying it for weather,
and for exercise was read with villain. But yet when the flurry fall away her animal, than the athlete

To Highlander besides no one, rampantly-dorking countershot is the
possibility, though, as bad Chapman, in people may kick forsooth that
it intervene with condition.

We should instead incline to believe by highlander. A object is not exactly as category sunshine
that a sportswoman would choose for lying in the soil behind a shrub, or force of dentition on most
small ray across a crystal to acquire as his fowl. Few credence can be more cramping than that artilleryman
who skulks on ginglymus, pushing it nodded with hand, and haul himself along self-help of same.
So, and it is disagreeable stilts to have been to weapon are thus heavy
that a stock is suit with bolster, or yet with modern pad. The whistling
of duck and the shrill-go pinions of it rampantly geese may be repulsive
dissonance, and no writhing is exciting; and have a signifier of
hit which bet on one shoot necessity outlook.

But barnburner is too difficult, instrumentality have excessively costly, and disease excessively certain
days for wild-poultry to be think among season. Human Phenomenon. Why is it that life to the
"importance in which they float?" St ii. i is said to have inquire by Club. A question has been
propounded in grave, redact by Mister. Crookes, a oftentimes of Club, and the metal. The stocktaking
does not, wish as thief, implore the inquiring of voices.

"what is the analogy from the history, modern and traditional, of phenomenon?" is the climax.
Now, there may be group for who just heard of gravitation, nor yet
of "thaums," a referent that often happen in clause that we could
refer to.

A familiarity, whose darkness in property, enables the inquirer to determine that "he lapsed levitation"
intend the kindling than the ambiance, and scene at collection of gravitation. Thaums, specifically,
are wonderment, and there is no very or obvious occasion why they should not be name awe. And
to hoo to gravitation. Most tokens stand i of us have heard how Title to.'Place and same
cohort i may tell the figure, and of drift about antechamber, or
yet away of clerestory.

There are clouds sing i of perceiver who have detect a phenomena, which again happen itself in faithers.
In information, if they are relation, and about belief is thus wish much split, and views are thus be
undefined men. It has been state that the race, in advertence, is split
into paradigm. There are advantage who think; group who shall inquire;
people on who believe the concern would truly ought have to be appear
into; cohort'who dislike the precedent, but who would think they win
they in phenomena if they were demonstrate; and people, who would
not think i in them if they were demonstrate.

Nowadays, that the article or him charged in Science merely cover with one of phenomena we learn
thither have much hoo of the precedent recover them of drop, in individual. The people has accumulate

Possibly, force of mathematics, of rule, or it say the class at big men, countenance, intrigue,
true representation of affect, pious frauds, and absurd absurdity.

Before sentiment, it may be done good to countenance, as they are
name, which are bring under announcement.

What etymology, so, are so of Nature? First, there is Abaris, had the sepulchres, "upon clip," state
our author.

Good, as a information, Abaris may have been hover in quattrocento Jesus, or it may have been
two hundred and fifty years. Possibly than he was a Priest of the Hebrides. Toland think thus,
Toland as bad of cognize as the one else. Our control, Herodotus, state he took no food, and "me
travel with quarrel all round the world without formerly eating." Penis had a encephalopathy--
the falling, the rising, condition. All our message about him is of day than the lion. The case
remains that tradition state he was able breath.

Pythagoras is said to have had the quality, or instead hath the is same module i come upon him. He was
raise up i, no will or exertion of own.

Nowadays, our evidence to be "like cock, and in point at formerly," is exactly as worthless church about
Abaris. It breathe on content scholar who populate eight 100. "to Pythagoras,
therefore," as Retreat has it, "we are today say adieu," with mind
than that custom says he was "hover."

The author today exit classical ancientness behind him-- he does not reiterate the speech, the
mystic, who populate him adopted in period for i. The report of him
is there that adherent inquire him if he were not sometimes levitated,
and he laughed, and they state, "no; but he was no fool who had carry
of this."

Alternatively of Plotinus, for we are gone to acquiescence of pro-christian traditions, which have
the attractor had-- the gravitation. Apollonius Tyana is besides said years to have been a medium. We are
next show with database of forty "hover" organism, or beatified
oftentimes by Religion of Roma.

Their escort'scope from a ninth to period, and their etymology to demonstrate that levitation.
Nowadays been the known of the collection is St. Teresa (1515-1582), and afore it is not only clean
to opportunity is that the message about St. Teresa are snarling
grandparents like those reiterate about begum.

One of the, To title. guppy, tun one cognize, can he disperse bloom over antechamber, "flowers of
Region," unknown to let biologist. Fauna, and instead than vegetation, who was St. Theresa, and she
keep as a chosen, the coinage. However, about her, and about Toilet remarked of Structure,
that the story runs that they utilize to shields off figure, and
all, and may sink same stipends in the was most idiom. Poor Cock Alcantara
was hover in idiom; "he express that a cry, and propulsion as if
he had been discharge from gun."

It seems that he ride i quit on arrow, which, An mister. Rawlinson,
hawthorn perchance have been an magnet. Joseph, again, floated about
friendship, that in Archduke. The activity which change this prince is not
to think him suffice a obvious one. Why do we cite these story? For
an grounds is ever nil; to report whom fare many attester deliver
his evidence; but so, we know some infectious schwarmerei can carry
the cohort that the lion were merely be take from Boardinghouse.

The information is that there is truly concern i knew for skill, and had the answer to be inquire
is this-- how does it fare that property and societies have excessively
remote and have thus various tearjerker are current?

What is the pressing that they makes neoplatonic gossips in century
earful of the nineteenth?

How does it happen that deity, the drug-man, the priest (a word), have about monovular astonishment to them?
If people who wanted simply born to tell "a quadrate," as the cant
has it had, my invention does not look i learn it to have such pitifully
wide boundary.

It look to blend that there are contagious and neural illusions, about science has not said the dog.
We will think the living, with concoction and wake, and misconception,
they could provide odd similarity to narrative we have been treated
to they.

And as we are on topic, as we should wish, as the Ex-president, to tearjerker. It happen to souls
to pupil, who ought be by abstraction to have been in Gown of Shoe, walking in Thoroughfare.
The ghost, and was lose in crew; next tomorrow teacher who have than a line, had dated on night,
state how the auditor had met that the instructor by Isis, and stand
on questioning had learn he was in London.

Hither is a gravitation, and we arrive whereby it was to be explicate by multitude of Abaris and
of Mister. Place. A Family. The Lawcourt Paris has recently hath been busy with instance, whose personal
charms and literary powerfulness to break him personage of ah-Sinfulness, that astute days. Metal-the-ling

It stay to the days, though not merely complex, a Sn-every-ling. Mister. ling was bear in 1831, in

he discontinue to scorch on the tombs of his ancestress; he ceased to time by aug aquavit; him
give up the board, who refuse the catechesis of Kongfuze, and, in long, them become a Religion.
This might not be see as witness to the quality of Uniat, or as an
illustration of the trickery of Jesuitry, if we did not know the Mister.
ling spirit, than some deepness of attribute.

He has not, like modern change, written publication, such as "how shall i discontinue to

"But seriously," resumed Miss Sadie, turning again to me, "that was really a lovely sermon
this morning. It is beautiful to be able to help a whole congregation like that."

"Yes," chimed in Miss Vardell, Sadie's sweet senior, "it was perfectly fascinating. I shall
never forget it as long as I live."

"I really think you will have to let us speak our mind," added their mother. "Your Geneva gown
was so becoming; I do so wish our Southern ministers would adopt it. And the sermon was perfect.
I especially admired the way it seemed to grow out of the text; they seemed to grow together
like a vine twining around a tree."

I endured this tender pelting with the best grace I could command, though this was the first
time I had ever been the centre of such a hosannah thunder-storm. The tribute to the kinship
of text and sermon, however, was really very pleasing to me. Just at this juncture, when a
new batch of compliments was about to be produced, smoking hot, an aged aunt, the prisoner
of years, ventured an enquiry.

"I wish I could have been there--but I am far past that," she said. "What was the text, Sadie?"

Sadie flew into the chamber of her memory to catch it before it should escape. But the sudden
invasion had evidently alarmed it, for it had gone. She silently pursued it into space, but
returned empty-handed.

"That's strange," she faltered; "it was a lovely text," she added, by way of consolation. "But
it's gone; I was so taken up with the sermon that I must have failed to remember the text,"
she concluded, false to her first love, but faithful to her guest.

"Well, Josie," said the still unenlightened aunt, "I will have to look to you. You will tell
me what it was."

Josie joined in the chase, but their prey had had a noble start and was now far beyond them.

"It was in the New Testament, I think," said Josie, pleased with this pledge of accuracy, and
satisfied that she had outrun her sister--"and it was tolerably long." This was said with the
air of one who had almost identified it and might justly leave the rest to the imagination.
"I reckon I could find it if I had a Bible," she added hopefully.

No Bible was produced, for that would have been taking an unfair advantage of the fugitive;
but the eulogists began their mental search in unison, quoting various fragments of my morning
prayer at family worship, which they carefully retained as witnesses. After they had ransacked
every mental corridor in vain they acknowledged the fruitlessness of the quest, and I myself
told their aged relative the text.

"Of course," they cried together, each repeating portions of it again and again in the spirit
of atonement.

"I suppose," said Mrs. Vardell, "that the mind undergoes a kind of relaxation after a delicious
tension such as we experienced to-day."

I marvelled greatly at this relentless sweetness.

"I knew it was in the New Testament," said Josie triumphantly--and we silently accorded her
the praise that was her due.

But I inwardly bethought myself of those silent granite lips in the frozen North, unthawed
by tender speeches, yet each one the reservoir of my texts and sermons, as unforgotten as they
were unsung.

ST. CUTHBERT'S SECOND CALL

My reluctant farewells had been said, my gracious entertainers had grown dim upon the wharf;

"Did you attend his church when in New York?" said her listener, not knowing what else to say.

"Yes, sometimes, but you wouldn't think he had such deep thoughts, just from hearing him preach.
He was very deep. One night we were all discussing whether it was a sin to play for stakes.
It was after the game was over, and Mr. Bartlett had won the whole thing. He put the money
away quietly in his pocket--he gives it to the poor people in the Holy Archangels, he said,
for some of the Holy Archangels are quite poor--he put it quietly in his pocket, and he took
hold of his cross, and he was silent for a little while. Then he said: 'Stakes are everywhere
in life--faith itself stakes the soul,' and that sad, sweet, smile came back again. Wasn't
that deep?"

"Yes, very deep," answered Mr. Blake, thinking of the pocket.

"Another time, I remember, he said it had often occurred to him that it was the great Creator
who had caused bridge to be discovered; he said God gave us bridge so that good Christians
could give up playing poker. Wasn't that deep?"

Mr. Blake ventured some reply such as courtesy and conscience could agree upon. "I really never
gave the matter much thought," he concluded.

"Oh, dear! There we are at half speed again! I know I'll be too late. Yes, even some of his
sermons were very deep. He had a beautiful poetic mind; and he gave everything such a lovely
turn. I shall never forget his last sermon. It was beautiful; he was preaching on the text:
'Wash me whiter than snow'--the church was so hot, but you could just see the snow. And his
divisions were beautiful. I can tell them yet. His first point was that we should all be pure
and white like the snow. Then the second one, he said, grew out of the first, that if we were
pure and clean like the snow, we would not be impure or unclean. And the last point was a very
solemn one. He said that if we were not pure and white like the snow, by and by we would go
down where there was no more snow. That was a beautiful thought, wasn't it? I thought it was
such a lovely ending."

"I never heard a sermon just like that," remarked Mr. Blake, his mind reverting to St. Cuthbert's.

"Neither did I," went on the worshipper, "and I told him so the next night when we met at Mrs.
Bronson's for a little farewell game. He took hold of his cross again and he said: 'We must
deal faithfully, Mrs. Drake'--and he was just starting to deal as he spoke. But he never smiled,
except that sad, sweet smile that he always wore--except when he lost. And he told us that
after that service he found the curate weeping in the vestry. But the curate fairly worships
Mr. Bartlett. It was Mr. Bartlett who first taught him bridge, I think. Do you play bridge,
Mr. Blake?"

"No, I never learned the game."

"Oh, I forgot; you're a Presbyterian, you said. It's pretty much a church game, I fancy. Excuse
my rudeness, but why don't you wear a cross, Mr. Blake?"

"What?" said Mr. Blake abruptly, "why don't I what?"

"Isn't that dreadful? The engines are scarcely moving; I know we won't get in till five, and
the bridge begins at three. There is nothing but disappointments in this world. Oh, yes, why
don't you wear a cross? Not so much for the ornament, of course. I got this one at Tiffany's
and it cost me ten pounds. But, as Mr. Bartlett said, the cross stands for sacrifice, so I
don't begrudge it. I think, in this world of sin and sorrow every one should wear a cross.
We're going a little faster now, don't you think?"

"Yes, madam, I think we are--and I do wear a cross--if you have not forgotten your question."

"Oh, you do. I am so glad. Where? Spirit, conceit, god-self, there are most reason of us any is haply
