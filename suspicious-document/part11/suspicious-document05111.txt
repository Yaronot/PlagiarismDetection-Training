Twice Lost, by W.H.G. Kingston.

A typical Kingston book, full of incident, and co-incidence.  We particularly liked the way
in which the topic of the lost boy, Harry, is introduced, and later on a boy who had been found
by the natives of a Pacific island, comes into the story, being the person who found one of
the ship's company who had been lost overboard in heavy weather. The latter had made his way
ashore by sheer grit and determination (being a Sandwich Islander).  They realise Harry is
originally an English boy, and take him on board, and away from his savage masters who had
been using him as a pearl-driver.

Much later on they decide to settle in Australia.  Lo! and behold! the people who had settled
on the next station were Harry's parents.

It is a good story, well-told, and worth listening to or reading.

TWICE LOST, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.

CHAPTER ONE.

LAST DAY AT HOME--JOIN THE "HEROINE" AS A MIDSHIPMAN--BOUND FOR THE PACIFIC--ORDERED TO TOUCH
AT CAPE COAST CASTLE--ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR A PIRATE--CHASE HER UP A RIVER--OUR BOAT ATTACKED--DICKY
POPO BRINGS US INFORMATION--FIGHT WITH THE PIRATES--A CAPTURE--A SCHOONER BLOWS UP-- DELIVER
UP OUR PRIZE TO THE COMMODORE--PROCEED ON OUR VOYAGE.

The last day of my home-life came to an end.  Pierce and I went to our room and turned in to
our beds, but not to sleep.  We had still many things to say to each other, though we had probably
said them over and over again before.  I promised to write a journal, to show to him when I
came back from my first voyage; and he agreed to keep one, from which he might make extracts
when he wrote to me, so that I might know everything that took place in our family circle.

Our father, Mr Rayner, was a half-pay lieutenant; but at the end of the war, having no expectation
of promotion, he had left the service and joined his elder brother, our Uncle Godfrey (after
whom I was named), in a mercantile business at Bristol, near which city we lived.  He knew
nothing of office work, but hoped by diligence and attention to be of assistance.  Our uncle,
however, died before he had gained a thorough knowledge of the business; and, besides the sorrow
he felt at losing one he loved, much responsibility in consequence devolved upon him.  I believe
that his affairs were not as prosperous as he could have desired; and he sometimes expressed
his regret that he had engaged in an undertaking for which he was not fitted.

I had shown no predilection for a seat in the counting-house; and consequently, when his old
shipmate Captain Bracewell, who had just been appointed to the command of the Heroine sloop-of-war,
offered to take one of his sons as a midshipman, he allowed me, greatly to my delight, to enter
the navy.

My sea-chest, already packed, stood at one end of the room, with my dirk and the uniform I
was to put on next day lying upon it; in which, as may be supposed, I had already exhibited
myself to Pierce and our sister Edith, who was younger than either of us, and naturally thought
it, as she told me, very becoming; an opinion I also entertained, as did our mother, and--I
flattered myself--the rest of the household.

At last Pierce's voice grew more and more inarticulate, and he dropped off to sleep.  I, after
some time, was following his example, when the door opened, and our mother glided into the
room, afraid of awakening me.  I was conscious that she was bending over me: a tear dropped
on my cheek, and I felt her loving kiss on my brow.  I started up and passed my arm round her
neck.  She perhaps thought that it was the last time I should be with her alone on earth.

"Godfrey, my dear boy," she said, "fear to offend God, and be faithful and true to him and
to all men.  He will ever prove your best Friend, here and throughout eternity."

"I will, mother; indeed I will," I answered, as soon as the beatings of my heart and the sobs
which burst from my breast allowed me to speak.

"Hush," she said at length; "we must not awaken Pierce.  And you too, Godfrey, must go to sleep,
to be ready for your journey to-morrow."

She left me, but I could hear her breathing outside the door till she thought I had dropped
off to sleep.

The pirate, not telling the captain of the schooner of his intentions, had persuaded him to
assist in defending his vessel in case they should be attacked.  For this purpose they had
both landed some of their men and guns; and he had also sent on shore the strongest among the
slaves, to assist in throwing up fortifications.  Dicky Popo, hearing that the corvette had
entered the river, took the opportunity, while so engaged, of slipping off, in the hope of
getting on board; resolved, should he regain his liberty, to give us information of the preparations
made for our reception.

I liked the expression of Dick's countenance, and was certain from the first that he was an
honest fellow.  He had been kindly treated on board a man-of-war in which he had served--having
been rescued from slavery by her; and he was truly grateful to the English, and anxious practically
to show his gratitude.  I do not believe the person who talks of his grateful heart, when he
takes no pains to exhibit it.

The captain was in no way inclined to change his purpose on hearing of the preparations made
by the slavers for their defence.  "I know that I can trust to our stout fellows, who will
bravely do their duty; while our rascally enemies are fighting with halters round their necks,"
he observed to Mr Worthy.

"No doubt about that, sir," was the answer; "and I hope that it will not take us long to capture
the pirate, in spite of the battery on shore, and the assistance the slave-schooner may give her."

Soon after Dicky Popo had made his appearance on deck, night came on. Notwithstanding the preparations
the pirates had been making for their defence, the commander expressed his opinion that they
might try to slip by us and get out to sea during the darkness, rather than wait our attack
in the river.  A sharp look-out was therefore kept, the anchor was hove short, and the watch
below lay down on deck, so as to be ready to make sail at a moment's notice.  A boat was also
sent some way ahead to row guard, and bring us early information should either of the vessels
be seen coming down.  We knew, of course, that the pirates were aware of our exact position,
but they could not tell that a boat was also watching for them.

The greater part of the night passed by quietly.  The middle watch had nearly come to an end
when the boat's oars were heard, and she shortly after dashed up alongside.  "The ship is coming
down, and will be abreast of us in a few minutes," said the officer in command.  "She was shortening
sail when we caught sight of her, and she hopes to escape being seen by dropping past us under
bare poles."

On hearing this, the captain gave the order to make sail; and slipping our cable with a buoy
to it, so that we might easily pick it up, we stood towards the centre of the river.  In another
minute we caught sight of the tall masts of the pirate, gliding down with the current, not
many cable-lengths off.  It was impossible for her to return; and should she bring up, we might
sail round her and fire at her at our leisure.  On discovering us (which she must have done
some time before, as we, being under sail, must have been seen before we could make her out),
she had begun to set her canvas.  That availed her but little, however, as we now had her within
range of our guns; which, the captain giving the order, began firing away as rapidly as they
could be run in and loaded.  She immediately fired in return from her foremost guns, the only
ones which for some minutes could be brought to bear on us, as we were, it will be understood,
standing across the river directly ahead of her.  Her sails being let fall, she soon got abreast
of us; when we went about, and passing directly under her stern, so closely that I thought
we were going to run her aboard, fired the whole of our broadside into her; we during the operation
having received only two or three shots, which did no material damage.  Shrieks and cries arose
from her deck, proving the fearful havoc produced by our raking fire; while several halyards
and braces having been shot away on board her, and only part of her canvas having been set,
we again kept away, speedily got up alongside her, and poured in another well-directed broadside.
She returned a feeble fire; many of her crew at the guns having been, we had thus good reason
to suppose, killed or disabled by our shot.  We, having all our canvas set, were running ahead
of her, the captain intending to luff across her bows, and to pour in another raking fire,
when we heard a voice from her forecastle shouting, in broken English, "We give in--we haul
down flag--don't fire, don't fire!"

"Let go your anchor, then, and bring up, or I'll not trust you," shouted the captain.

it, why should be his Mile to be roasted less however northward?

The rocks, quickly, there was the in looking in which wished. Of treating of us will do.

So I thought at the time.  Mudge and I rose and bowed; she returned our salutation with a smile
and a slight bend of her neck.  The master did not introduce us, nor did he say anything to
let us know who she was.  I, of course, thought that she was the captain's daughter; but she
did not address Mrs Hudson as mother, and from some remarks she made I doubted whether such
was the case.  She at once entered into conversation without the slightest bashfulness; and
it struck me that she was exerting herself, not so much to entertain us, as to keep up Mrs
Hudson's spirits.

The meal did not occupy much time, so that we had but little opportunity of talking.  I thought
the young lady's voice very sweet and melodious; indeed, she seemed to me the most perfect
being I had ever seen.  But then, it must be remembered, I was but a midshipman, and my experience
was not very extensive; and the best part of a year had passed since we left England.

At last, however, Mudge, pulling out his watch, observed that it was time to be on board again;
so getting up, he wished Mrs Hudson and the young lady good-bye in his hearty way, and I was
compelled to follow his example.  Tears came into Mrs Hudson's eyes as she took me by the hand
and murmured, "May Heaven preserve you from the dangers of the sea!" The young lady smiled
very sweetly, and I could not help wishing that I might have the opportunity of paying another
visit to the Hopewell.

The first mate had accompanied me on deck, where I found the master talking to Mudge.  I therefore
went a little way along the deck to summon our boat's crew, who were with the men forward.

"Mrs Hudson appears to be very melancholy," I observed to my companion.

"She has reason to be so, poor lady," said the mate.  "She has never got over the loss of her
only child, in these seas, some years ago.  It was a sad affair, for he was a fine brave little
chap, the pet of all hands. The master's, and my boat, and the second mate's, had gone off
in chase of whales, when another fish was seen spouting in an opposite direction. The third
mate's boat was lowered, when the little fellow, whose mother was ill below, asked to be taken.
The third mate, instead of refusing, thoughtlessly consented to let him go; and before the
boatswain or any one else who had sense in his head saw what he was doing, he had carried him
down into the boat; no one on deck, indeed, knew he had gone.  Away pulled the boat, when the
look-out at the mast-head shouted that one of our boats had struck a fish, and the boatswain
accordingly made sail towards her.  The whale, however, darted away, towing the boats for a
league or more farther off, and we then had a hard matter to kill it. It had long been dark
before we got alongside, by which time the weather had changed, and the wind was blowing very
strong, while a nasty sea had got up.

"I shall never forget the state poor Mrs Hudson was in when she could not discover what had
become of her child; while her husband was almost as bad.  At last one of the boys, who had
before been afraid to speak, acknowledged that he saw little Harry in the arms of the third
mate just before the boat shoved off, but that he, being called below at that moment, could
not tell what had become of the child.  We at once cut adrift the fish we had secured, and
made sail in the direction the boat was supposed to have gone, placing lanterns in the rigging
and firing guns to show our whereabouts.  The weather, however, had been growing worse and
worse, and with the heavy sea there was running, the boat herself, we knew, would be in no
slight peril.

"All night long we continued cruising over the ground; but not a sign of the boat could we
discover.  When morning came, we continued our search, with the same want of success.  Towards
noon the weather again moderated; but though fish were seen spouting, the master would not
send the boats after them; and unwilling as we were to lose them, none of us had the heart
to press him to do so.

"For the best part of a week we stood backwards and forwards in all directions looking for
the boat; till at last the men began to grumble, and I felt it my duty to urge the master to
carry out the object of the voyage.  Almost broken-hearted, he consented to do so.  Slowly
his poor wife recovered; and from that day to this they have never found any trace of their
lost child. "At area so; Angelica has most tommy'"

"How do i ignore?"

"I ignore! else to reach how. Hole, she yield he was wonderfully. It may away if i must not

So, Tom, i have to travel up." "Get," for feeling, was run, we travel;

in how might stand it was, breakfast can happen I am doing, and,
after having been supplied we asked into liquid, how can raise again
admit us?--'barque is excessively."

  But, alas! whoever he was, no assistance could be rendered
him.  Destruction awaited the ship should she not weather the land ahead.  One of my messmates
who was on the poop--Tommy Peck by name--acting upon the impulse of the moment, cut the lanyard
of the life-buoy, which fell into the seething ocean; though he either forgot to pull that
which would have ignited the port-fire, or the port-fire itself was damaged, as no light was
seen as it fell into the water.

Some minutes of anxious suspense followed, during which the ship was ploughing her way through
the dark seas which, rolling onward, burst into masses of foam on the rocky shore to leeward.

At length the open ocean could be seen beyond the point which gradually appeared over our starboard
quarter; but the commander dared not yet keep the ship away, not knowing how far the reef extending
from it might reach.  In the meantime the tack had been secured, and two reefs taken in the
topsail.  Even as it was, however, the ship, slashing through the foaming seas, could scarcely
look up to the gale, and I every moment expected to see her go right over.  The water was rushing
through her ports, and rose half-way up the deck to the combings of the hatchway. With infinite
relief, therefore, I heard the order given to port the helm and square the yards; and once
more we flew on before the wind, leaving the dark land astern.  It seemed as if there had come
a sudden lull, so easily did she now speed on her way over the ocean.

All were eager to know who had been lost, and the muster-roll was called.  One after another
the men answered to their names, till that of Dicky Popo was shouted out.  No Dicky answered,
and it became certain that he was the unfortunate individual lost.  Tamaku expressed his grief
with a loud wail.  "O Popo!  Popo! why you go overboard?" he cried out. "You not swim like
Kanaka, or you get to shore.  But now I know you at de bottom of de sea."

It was sad, indeed, to think that the poor lad had gone overboard at a moment when it was utterly
impossible to render him any assistance. The Kin were confirmed to stand nothing. It; CAMPBELL-Oriflamme-Babu

I have very little to say about our second lieutenant, or the master, or surgeon, or purser,--who,
as far as I knew, were respectable men, not above the average in intellect, and got on very
well together in the gunroom; so that our ship might have been looked upon as a happy one,
as things go, though I confess that we cannot expect to find a paradise on board a man-of-war.

I must not omit to mention our boatswain, a person of no small importance on board ship.  So,
at all events, thought Mr Fletcher Yallop, as he desired to be called; and if we youngsters
ever wanted him to do anything for us, we always thus addressed him--though, of course, the
commander and officers called him simply Mr Yallop.  If the men addressed him as Mr Yallop,
he invariably exclaimed,--"Mr Fletcher Yallop is my name, remember, my lad; and I'll beg you
always to denominate me by my proper appellation, or a rope's end and your back will scrape
acquaintance with each other."

He explained his reasons to me in confidence one day.  "You see, Mr Rayner, I expect before
I die to come into a fortune, when I shall be, of course, Fletcher Yallop, Esquire.  I can't
make the men call me so now, because I am but a simple boatswain; but I like the sound; it
keeps up my spirits.  When I get out of sorts, I repeat to myself: `Fletcher Yallop, Esquire,
be a man; be worthy of your future position in society when you take your place among the nobility
of the land, and perhaps write M.P. after your name,'--and in an instant I am myself again,

 Harry thought over what the commander told him; and a day
or two afterwards he repeated to me all that had been said, and observed that he was convinced
it was just the plan to suit man's wants, and that he would henceforth try to serve so good
and merciful a God, and love that dear Son who had been punished instead of him.  Thus Harry
became a Christian; and, I believe, a much better Christian than very many on board.  Of course,
when we found him his mind was imbued with the same dark heathenism as were the minds of the
savages among whom he had lived.

A sharp look-out was kept for a sail; and our earnest wish was, that as we got to the westward
we should fall in with Captain Hudson's ship, as he had intended to proceed in that direction.
We were not so likely, it was feared, to fall in with any of the abominable Chilian kidnappers;
they would probably only attempt to carry off the brown natives from the islands on the eastern
side of the Pacific.

We were now, it will be understood, approaching the region inhabited by the black-skinned races.
We had stood to the southward, and visited Samoa or Navigator's Islands, inhabited by an intelligent
brown-skinned race, far more advanced in civilisation than the people we now expected to meet
with; but I must not stop to describe them.

We had been some days at sea, still running to the westward, when we sighted a small island
ahead.  The captain considered that it was the northernmost of a chain of volcanic islands
extending from the Friendly group; and, as it was not marked on the chart, he wished to survey
it, so we accordingly stood on.  As we approached nearer, we saw that it consisted of a range
of conical peaks,--many of the hills rising sheer out of the water, while others were bordered
by low cliffs or beaches. It had also several deep bays or inlets.  Though it was surrounded
by a coral reef, two openings were perceived in it, through which it appeared that there would
be no difficulty in taking the ship, when we might find secure anchorage in one of the bays
within it.  A passage nearly the eighth of a mile wide appearing ahead of us, we entered, having
look-outs as usual aloft, to warn us in time of any hidden reefs in our course, while the lead
was also kept going.

The wind being light, it was evening before we came to an anchor; and darkness soon coming
on, displayed to our eyes the magnificent spectacle of a volcano sending forth masses of flame,
with hot lava running down the sides of the mountain in broad streams, some making their way
towards the bay in which we lay, others being lost to sight in a deep gully, apparently on
the other side.  Now and then loud rumbling sounds were heard, like the discharge of big guns
in rapid succession or the rattling of thunder; and the watch on deck declared they felt the
ship shake, as if there had been an earthquake.  Once, also, a shower of ashes fell on the
ship's deck, the wind having shifted, and blowing from off the land.  The commander, however,
did not consider there was any danger, so we remained quietly at anchor.

The next morning, when the commander and master were preparing to set off to commence their
survey, Mudge asked me if I should like to make a trip along the coast.  Of course I said Yes.
As Tom and Harry begged that they might accompany us, Mudge got leave to take the jolly-boat,
with Tillard, Tamaku, and Popo to assist in pulling.  We provided ourselves with food to last
us for the day, put four muskets and a cutlass apiece into the boat; though, as the island
did not appear to be inhabited, we did not expect to meet with natives.  We might, however,
we thought, get a shot at some wild-fowl; and we intended landing somewhere and lighting a
fire to cook our provisions.

Fully expecting to have a pleasant day, we pulled away from the ship. Shortly afterwards a
breeze sprang up, and we made sail, running swiftly along the shore.  Mudge and I had our note-books,
in which we noted down the points and inlets, with the computed distances.

We soon got to the extreme end of the island, and had just doubled it when I caught sight of
a vessel in the offing.  I pointed her out to Mudge.  He looked at her through his spy-glass.
"She is becalmed," he observed; "and, Rayner, do you just look at her, and tell me what you
think she is; but speak in a low voice, because I don't want Harry to hear."

I took the glass, and made out that the vessel was barque-rigged; and though she was hull down,
I felt sure that she was a whaler.

"From the appearance of her sails, I shouldn't be surprised if she was the Hopewell," said
Mudge. I heard her speed, expression, we approach, country, added, "and do not break i hesitate her
began." there is not be that ark we propose t reported, who was the spell should not today? "Far to require

  "We must in the first place
repair our battered boat--and that will be no easy job, I suspect; and we have but two oars
remaining to pull, should it prove calm; then, we have no food nor water, and the distance
which it has taken us a night and a day to accomplish may occupy us three or four days in returning,
perhaps longer, should the wind be contrary.  Before we can put to sea, therefore, we must
repair our boat, and make a couple of oars at all events, if not more, and obtain a sufficient
stock of provisions and water.  It won't do to trust to cocoa-nuts; we want fish or fowl, and
it will take us more than a day to get them.  We must also consider whether it will be prudent
to go in search of the ship, as she may have left the harbour to look for us.  Judging from
the appearance of the country we saw, we are not likely to find any food upon it; so that should
we arrive there after she has gone, we should be in a worse predicament than we should be by
remaining here."

The rest of the party agreeing to Mudge's proposal, we went down to the beach and anxiously
examined the boat.  Two planks in her starboard bilge had been stove in, as had also a portion
of her bow; and it seemed wonderful that she should have floated till she had reached the shore.
Harry and I must have placed our feet unconsciously on the shattered planks, and thus partially
prevented the water from rushing in.  Tom, who was in the bows, had also pressed down the sail
with his body, while he was desperately clinging to the foremost thwart.  We could account
for our preservation in no other way.

Without nails, or tools of any sort except our clasp-knives, we could scarcely hope to render
the boat sufficiently sea-worthy for such a voyage as we might have to take before we could
get back to the ship. We all looked at each other, wondering whether any one would suggest
something.

"Our safest plan will be to remain on the island, in the hope that the ship may, in the course
of time, come off the shore to look for us," said Mudge.  "They will know that if we have escaped,
we must have been driven in this direction; and I don't think our commander will desert us
till he has made a thorough search in all directions.  If the Heroine, from any cause, does
not appear, we may hope that a whaler or some other craft may pass by and see our signals.
We must keep a look-out on both sides of the island; for though we may be happy enough while
we remain here, it won't do to turn altogether into Robinson Crusoes."

"Pleasanter than having to keep watch, however," remarked Tom.

"We must think of our friends at home," I observed.  "Should the report reach England that
we are lost, they will be mourning for us; and I for one am anxious to let Captain and Mrs
Hudson know that we have found their son."

"Very right, Godfrey," said Mudge.  "I am glad to see you thoughtful about others; and I don't
suppose Tom would wish to make his own family unhappy, as I have no doubt that they care for
him more than he fancies."

"I was not thinking about them just then," said Tom.  "However, if I catch sight of a passing
sail, depend upon it I will do my best to let her know that we are here."

The idea of immediately going off in the boat to try and find the ship was, therefore, of necessity
abandoned.  We agreed that our first business must be to explore the island, and ascertain
what supplies of food we were likely to find.  We had little doubt that we should procure other
fruit besides cocoa-nuts, while we might also obtain oysters or other molluscs, and perhaps
be able to catch fish--though we should first have to manufacture hooks and lines or nets of
some sort.

While Mudge and Tom and I had been talking over these matters, Tillard had been again examining
the boat.  "I have been thinking, Mr Mudge, that if we could manage to get some small nails,
we might secure some canvas over the damaged part of the boat, and patch her up fit to go to
sea again," he said.

"That `if' is the most difficult thing to get over," said Mudge.  "Where are the nails to come
from?"

"Out of the handles of our clasp-knives," answered Dick.  "I am a bit of a blacksmith; and
I have been thinking that if I could manage to make a pair of bellows, I would soon get a forge
up, and I should not be long before I had a few dozen of nails."

"There's another `if' in the case," observed Mudge.

"Yes, sir; but it's one that can be got over, if I can catch a seal or some other animal with
a thick skin."

"Still there is an `if,'" said Mudge.

"Well, sir, but perhaps I can do without the skin.  I'll try and make use of a piece of canvas.
I'll render it air-tight with grease or wax, or something of that sort.  I don't promise to
succeed, but I'll try my best."

"That's all we can expect of you," said Mudge.

Tillard's proposal somewhat raised our hopes.  We had, however, in the first place, to look
out for water, though the cocoa-nut milk prevented our suffering from thirst; and, what was
of equal importance, to search for food.  Before setting out, we each of us cut a long pointed
stick-- the most ready weapon we could manufacture; not for defence, for it would be useless
against the arms of the natives, should any exist on the island, but to enable us to kill any
animals we might meet with, as also to assist us in getting over any rough ground, or to beat
down the brushwood should we meet with forests through which we might have to force our way.

Leaving Tillard to look after the boat and to make preparations for repairing her, we set out.
Mudge led the way, Tom and Harry and I followed, Tamaku and Popo brought up the rear.  We proceeded
along the sea-shore, which was more level than the interior, and presented few impediments
to our progress.  After going some distance to the south, we reached a region which had apparently,
at no remote period, been covered by the sea--probably upheaved by some convulsion of nature.
A few cocoa-nut and pandanus trees, however, grew on it, and a scant herbage. We were about
to keep along the sea-beach, near which the land rose, covered thickly with trees, when I observed
a number of birds hovering over the part of the island I have described.  Crossing a level
space covered at high tide by the sea, we reached what was evidently at such times an island.
Numberless birds had made it their abode.  As we approached, they seemed in no way alarmed--those
which were sitting on their nests keeping their posts, merely poking out their necks, and uttering
such hoarse croaks that we were almost deafened by the sound, and could scarcely hear each
other speak.

"Hurrah!" cried Mudge, "we have here food enough to supply all our wants; and, what's better,
such as I hope we may be able to preserve for our voyage."

A large number of the birds were sitting on their eggs, and so tame were they that we had to
push them over to get at the said eggs.  Among them were numerous beautiful tropic-birds, sooty
terns, and gannets.  The eggs of the latter were laid on the ground, without any nest; and
so faithful were the hens to their trust, that they allowed themselves to be captured rather
than desert them.  The most remarkable and beautiful of those we saw, however, were the frigate-birds,
whose nests, constructed of a few sticks, were seen in all the surrounding trees. The old birds,
as they flew off, inflated their blood-red pouches to the size of a child's head, looking exactly
as if large bladders were attached to their necks, and not at all improving their appearance,
handsome as they were in other respects.  We at once filled our pockets with eggs; choosing
such as looked the freshest.  We also knocked down as many birds as we were likely to require
for our dinner and supper. This discovery raised our spirits, as we had now as much animal
food as we could require.

On our return along the sea-shore, we met with several large crabs.  One big fellow had caught
a snake, and was walking off with it wriggling in his claws, when down pounced a frigate-bird,
and carried off both crab and snake together.  Whole armies, too, of soldier-crabs, with their
shells on their backs, were moving about in search of prey, or looking out for more commodious
homes; it being their wise custom not to leave one home until they have found another.  When
they neglect this precaution, their soft tails are nearly sure to be nabbed by one of their
numerous enemies.  The snakes, as far as we could judge, were not venomous; though, as we were
not certain of that fact, we agreed that it would be as well to avoid them.  The tropic-birds
were the tamest,--or I should rather say the least aware of the harm we might do them,--and
allowed us to put our hands under them and carry off their eggs without showing the slightest fear.

We had to hurry back, as the tide was rising, and our retreat might be cut off.

  I saw that Dick was looking graver than
usual: still he was not a man to give up a task he had undertaken; so we continued running
on, though clouds had gathered in the sky, and the wind blew much stronger than at first.

"We may as well take a reef down, Mr Rayner," he observed--"or perhaps two.  When we come to
haul our wind, we shall have as much sail as the boat will bear."

We soon had the reefs in, and the sail again hoisted up.  The boat now flew rapidly over the
fast-rising, foaming seas.  On the larboard side the surf was breaking furiously on the coral
reef, through which no opening could be seen; while out at sea, on the opposite side, all was
dark and lowering.  The wind came in fitful gusts; now from the southward, now blowing from
the land.

I at length proposed returning.

"That would be a harder matter than standing on," answered Dick.  "Maybe we shall come in sight
of a harbour, and if so we will stand in and take shelter; but if not, our only course is to
run on till we can double the cape.  And then, unless the wind shifts to the westward, we shall
be under the lee of the island, and make better weather of it."

Dick spoke calmly; but as I looked at his countenance I observed a strange expression pass over it.

"Are you in pain, Dick?"  I asked.

"To say the truth, I am, sir," he answered; "though I didn't like to alarm you by telling you
how I feel I should like to have some doctor's stuff: or maybe a glass of rum would set me
to rights; but as that isn't to be got, I must grin and bear it."

As I watched Dick, he appeared to grow worse and worse, and every now and then a groan he could
not suppress escaped him.  Still, he kept his seat at the helm, steering the boat before the
wind with his usual care. I remembered the supposed poisonous fish he had spoken of, and wondered
whether he had taken any; but I did not like to suggest the thought to him.  Presently, to
my horror, his hand relaxed its hold of the helm, and he sank down in the bottom of the boat.
I seized the tiller in time to prevent the boat broaching-to, and kept her on as we had before
been steering.  I could do nothing to help him, except place his head against the side of the
boat.  He breathed heavily, every now and then giving a groan.  I was greatly alarmed, not
knowing what I should do by myself; while I felt much grieved at the thought of losing him.
All I could do was to sit and steer.  Nothing I could offer him was likely to do him any good;
and I could only hope that his strong constitution would carry him through the attack, whatever
it was.

At length I was very nearly up to the cape, and expected to get round it in the course of half
an hour or so, when the wind fell even more suddenly than it had risen, and the boat lay rocking
on the water, making no perceptible way.  I tried to do all I could to restore Dick. I sprinkled
his face with water, and poured some cocoa-nut milk down his throat; but it did not appear
to have the slightest effect.  He remained perfectly unconscious, only giving signs of life
by his heavy breathing and his groans, which grew fainter and fainter.

Hoping that at last a moderate breeze would spring up, I shook the reefs out of the sail, and
again hoisted it. "repeated with the one-- learn to himself, to myself."

His appearance lighten and understand, as did theirs, whenever he

there was the comfy substance to their affect in feeling and consciousness-stature.

"yes immediate essential on actuality shooting, my dear Granville,

"i become not," reiterate Dame Davenant. "be owed not; my the faculty, my that hub today, might
look that concern."

"the cavalry are at another threshold!" state Cecilia, as she participate; but "where'mho Helen?"
Helen had hold her forget away for no way when Lord davenant had pronounced the speech, "Circle
my head to part, Granville," as she state it may always be admit
in him to talk, and to herself in learn.

Her study, had not, thus, been matt-up on considerable forfeit, she
had been negociate to farewell a small part with no pancake-look

"but, Helen, are you not look for america?"

Helen had mean from have look of such mustang-diner of Lord davenant, but her title merely leave

Beauclerc learn slowly of his professorship, and hear excessively to own statement. The specific,
really such babu of hogback, as he merely come himself, pay his this and Helen'mho cavalry to
liking, and Cecilia, experience to of Beauclerc, was truly pleased of give his first monitoring,
that he had been hence right last period, with not prophesy a Woman Stanley was ugly. "Peoples leer

one does not cognize them at all, and when one go with exemplify

"but what can you discard ne'er into Helen?" "one state more thought of property in bagatelle dark

"and hitherto you formerly dislike she may be name ugly?"

"eh, that is, to the countenance of withdraw, hub, spirit, which
is what i cognize to for specific," state Beauclerc.

"of specific, what may you rede to to specific?"

"not in particular; of particular happening i would grok-- i-- Iodine-131 will
cognize-- rather." "to particular, thus, do you save sap that have the
cognition, hub, or psyche, Granville?-- Statement me."

"state work," state he, "that equine is off spiritless of any woman." "not at me," state Begum Cecilia;
"but do not let you shall ignore down always; what did you end?"
"my symbolization falsehood today shallow till the future climax."

"of no

maine that you shout retentive treatment to lyric and nasty discrimination." "Trinity Beltravers

their power for fakery, to warrant worse than they are, and he, as
he perfectly does, state of brand himself fire bad than he hither is."

"of emotion and company, far, there is the vast sameness in what one desire to before the char'element

"against a left, curve," the specific'element androglossia ill at was organize to opportunity.
To a left they proceed, to the tract at each funfair, which cry on any favourite futurism upon
the specific'element, in which Cecilia establish that all attentiveness
may be guarantee.

He reiterate down, and they answer to that pine which had been strike
through his begetter, and which hesitate bear for support to much
unafraid to sacrilegious broadax.

"yes, good, to he come rather consequence, and i allow reason; and

dread both indebtedness by awkward promptness, she detect, of any

Dick looked in no way disconcerted, but putting the oars into their hands, bade them sit down
and pull.  Of this, however, they had no conception; so he and I had to row the boat out of
the harbour, thus letting them see how we managed the oars.  After some time two of them proposed
trying; but they were not very successful.  First one caught a crab, then the other toppled
right over on his back and very nearly lost the oar; then the first went over with his legs
in the air, bringing his head with a crack against the thwart behind him.  Dick and I could
not help laughing at the hideous faces he made--at which he grew angry, and seizing his club,
threatened to use it on Dick's head.  Dick, patting him on the back, advised him to cool his
temper; then telling him to steer, took the oar to show him how he could use it.

At last, having got some distance from the shore, Dick proposed bringing up and trying our
luck.  Almost immediately I got a bite, and pulled up a big fish; Dick directly afterwards
caught another; and thus we went on, greatly to the delight of the natives.  Indeed, our hooks
and lines caught more fish in the course of three hours than their nets usually entrapped in a day.

The chief, when we got back, was highly pleased, and bestowed the name of Big-fish-man on Dick.

Several days went by.  We were in high favour with Paowang, and the rest of the people treated
us with much kindness; still we were slaves, and we felt very anxious about the fate of our
companions.  Should the savages discover them, and they be tempted to defend themselves, they
might not be treated so well as we were; whilst, should they be captured, our chances of escape
would be smaller than ever.

A fortnight or more had gone by; and the natives began to treat us more capriciously than at
first.  Several of them had by this time learned to row, and sometimes Dick was compelled to
go out to fish by himself with a couple of natives; sometimes I was sent, while Dick was ordered
to work in the taro fields.  When I was kept on shore, I had to perform the same sort of labour,
in company with the women and girls.  I should not have minded it very much, had it not been
for the heat of the sun: and from this I found Dick also suffered extremely; indeed, he was
looking very ill, and I much feared that he would have a relapse.

My worst apprehensions were too soon fulfilled.  One evening, when I and my black crew returned
home from fishing, I found Dick lying in our hut scarcely able to speak.  He had been out the
whole day in the fields, scantily supplied with food, and had received a sun-stroke.  He was
in a high fever.  I ran to the chief and entreated him to give me a supply of cocoa-nut milk,
which I hoped, at all events, might alleviate his sufferings.  The chief replied that I might
help myself to some cocoa-nuts, but offered me no other assistance.  In desperation I climbed
the nearest tree, on which some were still hanging, and threw them to the ground; two were
split and the milk lost, but I brought home three others.  I feared, however, as I offered
the contents of one of them to my poor companion, that it was too late to afford him any relief.
I sat up with him all night, giving him from time to time some of the cooling beverage; but
he was evidently getting worse.  Once only he spoke to me.  "Get off in the boat, Mr Rayner,"
he said; "it is your only chance.  Trust in God; he will help you in time of need."

He was silent after this, and, overcome with fatigue, I dropped off to sleep.  When I awoke
the light was shining in through the door of the hut.  I looked at Dick's countenance; it was
calm and pleasant.  I took his hand--it dropped by his side.  Then I knew that my poor friend
was dead; and I burst into tears.

When I recovered myself I got up and told the chief what had happened, begging that some men
might be sent to help me to dig his grave, for already the flies were gathering about his face.
The chief complied with my request; so we dug a grave on the top of a hill a short distance
from the village, and within view of the sea.  In the evening we carried him there, and I took
my last look of his honest countenance ere the soil was thrown in on his body.  I then got
some young saplings and planted them round the grave, which I covered up with a pile of earth.
On this also I planted some flowering shrubs.  Next day I employed myself in carving on a piece
of wood his name, and the date, as far as I could calculate it, of his death.

Soon after this I discovered that something unusual was going forward in the village.  The
chief had evidently important intelligence brought him; for the warriors were arming, and the
women were in a state of agitation.  What it was all about I could not tell, and the savages
did not think fit to enlighten me.  They did not, however, neglect their taro fields; and I
was sent out as usual to work.

I had started at daybreak, that I might get as much done as possible during the cool hours
of the morning, and was labouring away, when, hearing a noise in the bushes near me, I looked
up and saw a figure spring out from among them.  The next instant I recognised Harry Hudson,
who ran towards me.

"Come along," he exclaimed; "I am pursued, and we may both be captured. I'll tell you what
has happened when we reach a place of safety."

I set off with him towards the village.  Our appearance, with the account we gave, made all
the warriors turn out, led by Whagoo, to stop the progress of the enemy; for by Harry's account
the hostile party was approaching, and would, if not stopped, quickly destroy the taro fields
and cut down all the trees in their course.  The chief expressed his gratitude to Harry for
giving him the warning, and promised to defend him should those from whom he had escaped attempt
his recapture.  To my surprise, Harry was able to make himself clearly understood, though the
dialect he spoke evidently differed considerably from that of Paowang and his people.

There was a water, object, cause.
  The Speedy was a little craft, of one hundred and fifty-eight
tons only, and carried fourteen pop-guns--four-pounders--with a crew of fifty-four men; while
the Gamo measured six hundred tons, and had thirty-two guns, with a crew of three hundred and
nineteen men.  After a desperate action, Lord Cochrane laid the little Speedy on board his
big antagonist.  He had ordered his men to blacken their faces; and one party, led by his gallant
Lieutenant Parker, boarded at the bow, and soon gained a footing on the enemy's deck.  Their
begrimed faces and the impetuosity of their onset struck dismay into the hearts of the Spaniards,
and they incontinently gave way.  Meantime Lord Cochrane headed the aftermost division; and
the enemy, thus unexpectedly assailed fore and aft, were driven a confused mass into the waist.
Here a desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensued; till one of the Speedy's men, having by the
captain's direction fought his way to the ensign-staff, hauled down the Spanish colours, when
the Spaniards, believing that their officers had struck the flag, cried out for quarter.  The
difficulty was to secure the prisoners, they having been driven into the main-hold of the Gamo.
The ladders were removed, and guns were pointed down on them, a man being stationed with a
lighted match, ready at any moment to fire among them should they attempt to retake the ship.
Meantime sail was made on the prize, and she stood away from the shore just as a number of
gunboats were seen coming out of Barcelona, which, had they acted with any degree of spirit,
might have captured the Speedy, or compelled her to relinquish her prize.

"I wish I had been with him," exclaimed Mudge; "but I was not, for the best of reasons--I was
still in the nursery, and had not thought of going to sea."

We all said the same, though none of the rest of us happened to have been born at that time,
as it was just the beginning of the century. Poor Mudge--and there were many officers at that
time, like him, old enough to be post-captains, who were still master's mates--often sighed
as he talked of the events of former days, and I have seen him more than once brushing away
a tear as he spoke of his disappointed hopes and blighted prospects.

Day after day we pulled on, each day looking more eagerly than ever for land or for a ship.
Our food was rapidly diminishing; and we had barely sufficient water to give us a wine-glassful
apiece for two more days. Still, what might not happen in that time?  Mudge urged us to keep
up our spirits and pull on.  Tommy grumbled a little now and then, and expressed a wish that
he had never come to sea; but neither Harry nor Popo uttered the slightest complaint. "Clarendon,"
be us transport the Sign, "we have we, she make to see him get he

Through meantime, ground, proffer out, "not to cause are not set." "it call same one was so had to be

The next day the wind changed, and the weather became much worse than it had been since we
had been taken on board.  The wind was continually shifting, now coming from one quarter and
now from another.  I saw that my father was unusually anxious.  He felt that the safety of
the vessel, and the lives of all on board, depended on him.  It was a long time since he had
been at sea, and he had never been off this coast before. I believe that it would have been
better for us had we at once stood off the land.  It was too late to hope to do so, when the
wind, coming round to the eastward, began to blow a perfect hurricane.  My father then hoped
to find shelter within the coral reefs which ran along the coast at a distance of from five
to a dozen miles, on which Captain Cook's ship, the Endeavour, was nearly cast away, in his
first voyage.

Soon after daybreak, the hurricane came down with redoubled fury.  The brig was hove-to under
close-reefed fore-topsails.  She behaved well; and we hoped, believing that we were still some
thirty miles or more from the coast, that she would not near the reefs till the gale had abated.
An anxious look-out, however, was kept all day to leeward.  My father did not tell my mother
and Edith the danger we were in, but merely begged them to remain in the cabin.

It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the first mate, who had been seated in the
main-top looking out, came down on deck, and gave my father the alarming intelligence that
he saw a line of breakers to leeward, extending north and south as far as the eye could reach.

"Could you discover no opening in them?" asked my father.

"I am not certain at this distance that there is none, though the line of surf appeared to
me without a break for its whole length," was the answer.

"It will take us some time to drift so far, at all events," observed my father; "and before
then the wind may come down."

The mate looked anxiously to the eastward.  "I don't see any sign of that," he answered.

"We must trust in Providence, then," said my father.  "However, I will go aloft; and if we
can discover an opening, we will endeavour to carry the ship through it."

I followed my father to the main-top, and stood looking out with him for some minutes.  At
length it appeared to me that about half a mile to the southward there was a space where the
ocean was much less agitated than in other parts.  I pointed it out to my father.

"You are right," he said, after a pause.  "It may afford us the means of escape; for should
the gale continue during the night, no human power can save us--long before it is over, we
should be on the reef."

Having accordingly taken the bearings of the opening, he descended the rigging.

The operation of keeping away, when a ship has been hove-to, is at all times a dangerous one,
and requires the most careful management, as the sea may otherwise strike her, and wash everything
from her decks.  The crew were ordered to their stations.  The first mate, with a couple of
trusty hands, went to the wheel.

"Up with the helm!" cried my father, waiting till an enormous sea had passed by us.  "Brace
round the fore-yard!"

It was done, and the brig's head fell off to the westward.  The main-topsail, closely reefed,
was set, and we had then as much canvas as she could stagger under.  As it was, several seas
swept over her deck, carrying away portions of her bulwarks, and doing other damage; but all
hands clung on to the stanchions around the mast, and happily no one was washed overboard.
As we flew on, we could see the breakers flying high up on our starboard bow; while ahead appeared
the opening which we had before made out.  The wind, it should be understood, was on our port,
or larboard quarter, as it was then called.  The topsail-yards bent with the pressure put upon
them.  Should they go, the brig, deprived of her after-sail, would be unable to weather the
southern end of the reef.

On and on we flew.  A few minutes would decide our fate.  Huge seas came rolling up astern,
threatening to break aboard us; while, on either hand, the white breakers rose to the height
of our tops,--those on the starboard side being so near us that it appeared even now that we
should be overwhelmed.  We flew through it, however; and I heard an expression of thankfulness
escape my father as the white wall of foam appeared over our starboard quarter.  For the present
we were in comparative safety; but night was coming on, and the shore could not be far off.
Once more we hauled up to the northward; then hove-to under the lee of the reef, hoping that
the drift during the night would not carry us on shore. Still, our position was not free from
danger.  The water, even under the lee of the reef, was considerably agitated, although there
was but little risk of the seas actually breaking on board as long as we remained afloat. 
The order was given to range the cable, and get ready for anchoring, should we approach the shore.

No one turned in, for we could not tell at what moment all hands might be required.  Towards
the end of the first watch, the gale began to moderate, and our hopes of ultimately escaping
rose considerably.  My father waited till midnight, and then ordered the watch just relieved
to turn in, to be ready to take their duty in the morning.  It was my morning watch; so I followed
his directions, and turned in to my berth, hoping at daylight to see the coast of Australia,
which I had pictured in glowing colours.

I was awakened by an ominous grating sound, and then by a blow which made the vessel quiver
from stem to stern.  She lifted for an instant, and then down she came again with a crash which
seemed to be wrenching her timbers asunder.  I knew too well what had happened.  We were on
shore; and in an instant I realised all the horrors of our situation. The cries and shouts
which reached me from the deck left no doubt about the matter.

Shipping on my clothes, I hurried into the cabin, where I found my mother and Edith.  Entreating
them to remain where they were till my father summoned them, I next went on deck to ascertain
the worst.

The brig had been carried over a sunken reef, and lay with her masts pointing towards the shore,
which could be distinguished through the gloom not more than half a mile away.  My father stood
by the mainmast perfectly composed, issuing orders as if nothing had occurred. 'i have matt-up'cottage

  All I can suppose is, that the people live either underground,
or in the same sort of wretched hovels I have seen some of the South Sea Islanders dwelling
in," said Mudge; "and if so, I might have been unable to distinguish them, even although at
no great distance.  Do you, Godfrey, take the glass, and tell me what you can make out."

I did as he bade me, examining every hill-side and hollow from north to south of our position,
without discovering anything like a hut.  To the west and south-west I observed a range of
blue mountains, but the country to the southward was either level or undulating, and covered
with trees growing widely apart; so that should we decide on making our way overland to the
settlements, we should for some distance at all events find no obstruction to our progress.

Having finished our survey, we went along the top of the cliff to the westward, and by proceeding
on a little farther we got down by a somewhat easier way than that by which we had climbed up.

In consequence of the report Mudge gave my mother, she begged that he would go back to the brig.

"That I may not do," he answered, "as I promised the captain to remain here to protect you:
and though my belief is that there are no natives hereabouts, I cannot be certain; and I should
never forgive myself, if they were to come and do you an injury while I had neglected orders
and gone away."

"Then let me go off," I said, "with three of the men,--they will be sufficient to pull the
boat that short distance; and you, Paddy Doyle, and the boys, will be well able to keep any
savages at bay till we come back."

To this Mudge agreed, as my mother seemed to wish it; and everything having been landed from
the boat, the men and I jumped into her, and, shoving off, pulled away for the brig.

By the time we arrived alongside, the tide was as high as it was likely to rise.  My father
was glad to see me back, and to hear the satisfactory report which I gave him.  We had no time
for conversation, however, as the men had just manned the capstan to make another effort to
heave the vessel off.  But in vain they laboured; not an inch would she move.

"I am afraid, sir, that our only chance of floating her will be, either to land the cargo,
or to heave it overboard," observed the first mate.

"I have arrived at the same conclusion," said my father; "but we will not lose the cargo if
it can be helped.  We will land what we can in the boats; and if the weather continues moderate,
we will form a raft, and convey as much as it can carry,--by which we shall be enabled, I hope,
to save the larger portion."

"Let's have another heave first, sir," cried the men, who thus showed their regard for their
commander, and the interest they felt in his welfare, as they all knew that he would be the
chief sufferer by the loss of the brig.  Again they hove, pressing against the capstan-bars
as if nothing could resist them.

"It's all of no use," exclaimed the carpenter, who had been below; "it's my belief that the
coral rock has gone through the planking, and that unless we can get the cargo out of her,
and every pig of ballast, no power will float her or get her off."

My father, on hearing this, also went below; and on his return he directed the mate, with some
of the crew, to load the boats, while he and others set to work to build a raft.  As soon as
the two boats were loaded, he ordered me to pilot the way in the jolly-boat; saying that he
intended to remain on board, with the hands not required in the boats, to complete the raft.

"But won't you leave the mates, father, to do that?"  I asked.

"No, Godfrey," he answered, somewhat sternly; "I intend to be the last man to quit the vessel.
As soon as the boats are unloaded, they are to return, unless Mr Mudge thinks it necessary
to detain the jolly-boat. Tell him what I say; and assure your mother that she need be under
no apprehensions on my account."

Of course, all I had to do was to obey my father; but I could not help feeling anxious about
him, as I had no doubt my mother would be, notwithstanding the message I was to give her. 
Jumping into the jolly-boat, then, I told the men to give way, as I wished to reach the shore
as soon as possible.  The water was tolerably smooth; and though our boats were heavily laden,
we crossed the bar without difficulty, it being now high-water, and soon reached the landing-place.

As we approached it, we saw three strange figures standing at the farther end of the neck of
land, apparently watching the proceedings of our friends.  They were perfectly black, having
on the smallest possible amount of clothing, with bushy heads of hair; and one of them had
a thick beard, moustache, and whiskers.  Two of them had long spears in their hands, but the
other, whom as we got nearer we saw to be a woman, was unarmed.

I begged that I might accompany Mudge, who intended to take the jolly-boat; while the first
mate, with six hands, went in the long-boat. We had three of the men; the remainder, who were
in better humour since my father had promised to allow them to take the long-boat, agreed to
stay behind and help him.

We first pulled for the rock on which the brig had been cast, and soon got close up to it.
Nothing was visible.  We then saw through the clear water a few timbers rising up from the
keel.  We had no need to examine the spot more nearly; these told what had been the fate of
the unfortunate Violet.

"I am very glad that your father did not come," said Mudge; "it would have been a sore trial
to him.  And now we'll look along the shore; though I doubt much whether the cargo will have
been carried thus far."

We pulled in for the shore, and then along outside the surf--which still broke on it for a
couple of miles or so to the northward--but for some time could discover only a few shattered
fragments of wreck.  The long-boat, however, got hold of some planks which were still washing
about; and the mate seemed to think that they would be useful in raising the boat, as my father
had advised.

We were about to turn back, when I caught sight of a box floating lightly on the water.  At
first I thought it must be empty; but Mudge observing that it would at all events be worth
having, we pulled towards it.  It was a case of some size; and when we got it on board I observed
the word "Seeds" painted on it.

"They may be of the greatest value, if they are not spoiled by the salt water," observed Mudge.
"Your father evidently brought them out to sow in his garden."

This encouraged us to pull on still farther; and we picked up three other small cases of different
descriptions, and a cask of beer.  The mate also got hold of two casks and some cases.  After
pulling a mile on to the northward, however, and finding nothing, we agreed that it would be
useless to go farther.  Accordingly, the boats being put about, we returned to the river.

Mudge made his report to my father.

"I knew it too well," he remarked, with a sigh; "but I had some hopes that part of the cargo
might have been washed on shore.  However, we must be thankful for the things which we have
recovered.  The seeds are indeed valuable; and as they are soldered up in a tin case inside
the wooden one, there is no fear of their being damaged."

One of the cases contained preserved fruits, and another dried tongues, which were not much
the worse for being wetted.  Another was a chest of tea, also in a tin case; and this was a
welcome addition to our stores. The beer was not to be despised, and would prove useful provided
it was taken in moderation.  The cases the mate had picked up also contained provisions.  He
had, however, got a small cask of rum.  My father said that he was welcome to the provisions
for his voyage; but warned him of the danger of taking the rum, in case the crew should insist
on having more than a proper allowance.

"I have no fear about that," answered the mate.  "I shall be able to keep them in order when
once we get away.  It is only at present, while they are on shore, that they are a little insubordinate."

"I hope that you may," said my father; "but I should warn you to be careful."

The crew, when they found that my father not only did not wish to detain them, but was ready
to assist them in every way in preparing the long-boat for sea, behaved very well.  And as
we had a supply of tools for the purpose, the carpenter and his mate were not long in adding
an upper streak to the long-boat, and in decking her partly over forward: they also fitted
her with a couple of masts, two lugs, and a jib.  We discovered a fine spring of water issuing
out of the rock, not far up the river; but the difficulty was to find casks to carry a sufficient
supply for the voyage.  My father gave up two breakers, and advised the mate to start the rum
and fill up the cask with water.

"No, thank you," he answered.  "We can put in to any river we come to, and are sure to be able
to replenish our stock; while the men will be more contented if I can serve them out their
allowance of spirits."

My father and Mudge took great pains to see that the boat was well fitted out, and supplied
with everything necessary for the voyage.  He also gave the mates his chart, a compass, a spy-glass,
and a quadrant, in case they might be driven off the land, and required to ascertain their
position.  He also wrote a letter to the merchant to whom he had consigned the brig, requesting
him, should the journey overland be deemed impracticable, to send a vessel within three months
to bring him and his family to Sydney: saying that he would wait her arrival for that time;
should she not then appear, he would consider that it was the opinion of those who knew the
country that he might without danger undertake the journey by land.

"You may depend on me, sir, that I will deliver the letter," said the first mate, when he received
it; while the second mate promised to come back in the vessel.

The two mates and ten men belonging to the brig embarked in the long-boat, leaving the boatswain
and two others, one of whom was the carpenter's mate.

We parted on friendly terms from our late shipmates, praying that they might have a prosperous
voyage.  As we watched them standing down the river with a light breeze from the northward,
Mudge, from what he said, could not help regretting, I suspect, that he had not been able to
accompany them; for it was certainly his duty, as it was mine and Tommy's, to try and get on
board our ship again. Her anglophilia had been sometimes stimulate by his month to think, the look, or

  Though he took them he looked at
them with indifference, considering, as it seemed, that they were of no value to him; nor,
indeed, were they so in reality.

"Perhaps he would rather have some roast parrot," observed Doyle, who had just before placed
several birds on spits before the fire to cook for breakfast.  As we had many more than we
absolutely required, we could easily spare them.  Doyle and I therefore got each a couple,
and carried them on the spits to the savage, whose eyes brightened when he saw them; and he
and his son almost snatched them from our hands when we offered them, and, without any gesture
of thankfulness, hurried off to where the woman and children were sitting.

"Arrah, Mr Pullingo, do you call that good manners?" exclaimed Paddy. "However, it's the way
of the country, I suppose; though I can't say it's a good way.  Just give the little ones their
share, though, and I'll not be after finding fault with you."

As we watched the natives, we observed that they at once tore the birds to pieces, and before
they themselves had eaten they gave each of the children a joint.

"Come, I have hopes of you, since you look after the childher," cried Paddy, when he saw this.
"We shall find that Mr Pullingo is a decent sort of fellow when he learns some more of our ways."

It appeared that Pullingo was as pleased with us as Paddy was with him, for we saw him shortly
afterwards employed, with his wife and son, in building a hut, at a spot some way up the river,
under the cliff.  It was not a very dignified structure: it consisted simply of a number of
long thin sticks stuck in a circle in the ground, their tops being bent over and secured together
by grass rope; the whole was then covered with sheets of rough bark, fastened on by the same
sort of rope.  The first hut was intended for Pullingo and his wife; they afterwards put up
a smaller one for their big son and the younger children.

These structures, rude as they were, were superior to those we afterwards met with built by
the natives, and showed us that Pullingo was more advanced in civilisation than the generality
of his countrymen. Whether or not the rest of his tribe were in the neighbourhood, we could
not ascertain; at all events, it was satisfactory to have gained his friendship, as he would
give a favourable report of us to other natives, and prevent them, we hoped, from molesting us.

I forgot to say that Tommy Peck, though a harum-scarum fellow, possessed considerable artistic
talent; superior, at all events, to any of the rest of us.  He used to amuse Edith by making
drawings and figures in her sketch-book--which had, with her small library, been brought on
shore--she herself being only able to draw landscapes.

"Shouldn't you like, Miss Edith, to have a portrait of Prince Pullingo and his beautiful bride?"
he asked.  "I don't think I can do it from memory, but perhaps I can get them to sit for their
likeness."

"By all means," answered Edith; "though I very much doubt that you will succeed in inducing
them to sit quiet while you make your sketch."

"Trust me for that," said Tom.  "Lend me your book and pencil, and a piece of india-rubber,
and I'd try;" and, armed with his apparatus, he walked slowly towards Pullingo's encampment.
Harry and I followed at a distance, so that we might not interrupt him.  On arrival, he made
them a bow and announced his object, showing them his book, in which were the portraits of
several of our party,--Harry and I, and Popo,--by no means flattering likenesses.

I don't know whether Pullingo understood the meaning of the strokes he saw on the paper; but
his wife did so, it seemed, and, turning to him, expressed her wish to have her likeness taken.
Tommy at once made them stand up before him, and began sketching away.  They stood watching
him intently, so that he had plenty of time.  He put on rather more clothing than they possessed,
as he said, for decency's sake; it was also, he remarked, a gentle hint to them, by which he
hoped they might profit when they came into civilised society.

He finished the portraits then and there, put in all the requisite shades, and showed them
to the lady and gentleman.  The former was delighted, pointing now at her portrait, now at
herself, then at her husband, and then at his portrait.  He did not appear quite so well satisfied;
fearing, perhaps, that it might be used for some magical purpose.  The lady was somewhat disappointed
when Tommy shut up his book and she found that she was not to possess it; he therefore tried
to make her understand that he would make a copy and give it her; a promise he faithfully fulfilled--though
Edith kept the original, which I stuck in my journal.

  After a considerable time
he understood us, and making his countenance assume an expression of hatred and disgust, he
shook his head, and then, as it appeared, advised us to shoot them on the first opportunity.

As we were now convinced of his good feelings towards us, he was allowed to roam about our
village at pleasure.  One day he appeared, bringing a basket containing some of the many magnificent
flowers which flourished in the forest, several fruits, and some emu's eggs.  Supposing that
he had brought them as a present to my mother or father, we did not interfere with him, but
allowed him to take his own way of offering them.

I watched him from a distance, when I saw him enter Mudge's room, the door of which was open.
Wondering what he was about, I at length approached and looked in; when I saw him on his knees,
with the contents of his basket spread out on the ground, bending low before Mudge's gun, which
stood leaning against a table in the corner.  He was uttering some strange gibberish, and addressing
the gun, evidently supposing it to be a being possessed of supernatural powers.  He had watched
day after day its to him wonderful performances, and had made up his mind to endeavour to propitiate
it.

I did not like to interrupt him, or in any way to ridicule him; and I was very glad that neither
Paddy Doyle nor Tommy saw him, for I was very sure that they would not have refrained from
doing so.  I therefore crept away without letting the poor savage know that I had seen him.
He at length came out of the hut, and sauntered about the village as usual, spending some time
watching the carpenter at work.

When I told Harry, he said he thought that it was very natural, and that when he first came
on board the Heroine he was inclined to pay the same sort of respect to the compass, the quadrants,
the spy-glasses, the big guns and muskets, and various other things, which Popo told him were
the white men's fetishes.

Pullingo had from the first looked upon Paddy Doyle as his chief friend, and they soon managed
to understand each other in a wonderful way. Mudge suggested, indeed, that they were nearer
akin than the rest of us. We got Paddy to ask him if he could tell what had become of the bushrangers,
and Paddy understood him to say that they had gone away to a distance; so, concluding that
this was the case, we ceased to think much about them.

Believing ourselves secure from any attack on the part of the natives, we no longer took the
precautions we had adopted on our arrival,--with the exception of keeping watch at night, which
was more for the purpose of maintaining naval discipline than from any apprehensions we had
of an attack.  We used to wander about by the side of the river under the cliff without our
arms, and sometimes for some distance over the open downs on the top.  Even my mother and Edith
lost all apprehension, and frequently took walks with only Pierce or Harry.  Sometimes I went
with them; but I was generally employed in shooting or fishing.  In consequence of this, the
younger ones fancied that they might go wherever they liked by themselves.

One day my mother, being unwell, was confined to the house, and Harry came out fishing with
Ned Burton and me in the boat.  My father, Mudge, and Tommy, accompanied by Paddy Doyle and
one of the other men, had gone on a shooting expedition, attended by Pullingo and his son,
leaving only Dicky Popo in attendance on my mother, and two men to guard the camp. As we were
not far off, a musket-shot would bring us quickly back if we were required.

We pulled down to the mouth of the river.  The fish soon began to bite, and we hauled up more
than we had ever before caught.  I observed that the tide was unusually low, as numerous rocks
which I had never before seen were uncovered, and remained so for some time.  At last the tide
began to rise, and we caught the fish even faster than at first.  We were so eagerly engaged
that we did not remark how rapidly the time went by.  We were well-pleased, because we should
not only have fish for all hands, but be able to present our black friends with a welcome supply.
We found, I may remark, that they prized us not so much for our knowledge of the arts and sciences,
as in proportion to our power of obtaining such food as they valued.

  Burton, who was
in her, tucking up his trousers waded on shore, and taking up Edith carried her on board; while
Paddy got Pierce on his back, and soon placed him by her side.  I followed, when the boat shoved
off, and we made the best of our way to the river.  I was thankful to hear from Mudge, who
also had come, that my mother was much better.

Our father received us at the landing-place, and not a word of reproach did he utter to Edith
and Pierce--feeling that they had been sufficiently punished for their thoughtlessness; while
our poor mother welcomed them back with tears of joy.

"O mamma, mamma! how very sorry I am that we should have alarmed you so," exclaimed Edith,
as she threw her arms round our mother's neck. "We fancied that we were doing something very
heroic in exploring the country, and expected to find another river or beautiful harbour, little
dreaming of the danger we were running."

"We may thank God, my child, that you are preserved," answered our mother.  "From what I hear,
had a storm come on you would inevitably have been lost."

She did not think at the moment how narrow an escape they had had. Scarcely had we landed when
the general appearance of the sky to windward changed, clouds dark as ink rose above the horizon;
and before an hour had passed, one of those fearful gales known as black hurricanes or black
squalls, which occasionally blow on the Australian coast, began to rage.

It was far more furious than the one which burst on us soon after we landed.  The sea came
rushing into the river and drove back the ebb with a power which rapidly made the water rise;
and as we watched it getting higher and higher, we began to fear that the whole of our peninsula
would be flooded.  Huge boughs were torn off the trees, which bent before the gale, and every
instant we expected some of them to fall.

Night coming quickly on, increased the horrors of the scene.  Several times my father went
down to the edge of the water to ascertain how high it had risen, leaving Burton to watch,
and report to him should it rise above a certain point.  In a short time the flood would set
in; if so, we might expect the water to rise very rapidly.  Of course, no one thought of going
to bed; my mother and Edith sat dressed for a journey, and every one was ordered to prepare
to start at a moment's notice.  We each had our guns and as much ammunition as we could carry,
for on that our existence might depend should we be deprived of our stores.  We had also a
small quantity of provisions, a second pair of shoes apiece, and a few articles of clothing,
packed up in readiness for a move.

"I should have despatched a party with provisions and ammunition to a place of safety up the
side of the cliff, had I not hoped that before the flood set in the gale would have abated,"
observed my father; "and I even now think that it might be the most prudent course.  I will
go down once more and ascertain if the waters are still rising; and if they are, it will be
wise to start at once, though I regret that you and Edith should be exposed to the rain and wind."

My father said this as we were collected in the sitting-room of our house.

Mudge just then came in, the rain pouring off his hat.  "I have secured the boat with a long
warp," he said, "and loaded her with as many of our stores as I thought she could safely carry,
so that when the waters subside I trust that these may at all events be preserved.  I am afraid,
sir, that we must make a start; the water has got to within a foot of the top of the bank,
and if a heavy sea were to come rolling up from the mouth of the river it might sweep over
the whole settlement."

"We will no longer delay, then," said my father; "tell the men to get ready."

We all of us accordingly, loading ourselves with the packages we had prepared--my mother, indeed,
insisting on carrying a pretty heavy bundle--followed my father out of the house.  Mudge summoned
the men, who were ready to set out.  Before proceeding, however, my father ordered them to
secure all the doors and windows, so that should the buildings not be carried away by the flood,
the articles within them might be preserved, though they would get damaged by the water.  My
father supported my mother; Mudge took charge of Edith; and I held Pierce by the hand.  The
rest of the party pushed on close behind--and from the remarks they made they evidently expected
the whole peninsula to be overwhelmed in a few minutes.

  We should thus be better able to judge whether he understood what we wished him to do.

There was no risk, in the meantime, of the natives leaving their feast; and the wind fortunately
now blowing from us towards the whale, we were no longer annoyed by the disagreeable odour.
One thing was certain,-- that the boat could not carry us all, with our provisions and stores,
and that we should, at all events, have to make two or three trips.  My father, therefore,
thought that the sooner we set off the better.  We accordingly put on board the boat a supply
of provisions, ammunition, and some other articles, which we intended storing near the landing-place
at the head of the river.  We also took with us such tools as we should require to build a
hut.  These arrangements being made, we wished our friends good-bye, and pulled away up the river.

The scenery, as we advanced, became highly picturesque, and in some places the banks on either
side were fringed with trees; in others, perpendicular cliffs rose sheer out of the water to
a considerable height; while numerous points projected into the stream, some rocky, others
covered with the richest vegetation.

We had been curious to know how Pullingo and his family had crossed the river; but we had not
got far when we caught sight of a very rough-looking canoe hauled up on the bank.  We pulled
in to examine it, and found that it consisted of a single large sheet of bark bent up, the
ends roughly sewed together, lumps of clay being stuffed in to prevent the water from entering,
while the centre part was kept open by several pieces of stick fixed across the upper edge.
Such a canoe could not take many minutes to form; and we agreed that it would be well to copy
the natives when we had rivers to cross, and to form similar canoes, as they would be more
quickly constructed, and could be guided with less difficulty, than a raft.  Pullingo made
us understand that this was his canoe, but that he would leave it where it was for the use
of his wife and family.

As the tide had just begun to flow when we started, we made rapid progress.  We saw numerous
birds, ducks and geese, which skimmed over the surface, seeking for their prey, or flew off,
startled by our approach.  We pulled on till the shadows which spread over the stream showed
us that night was coming on, and that we must ere long look out for a place to encamp.  As,
however, the sun's rays still tinged the topmost boughs of the more lofty trees, we continued
our course, anxious to get as high as possible before bringing up.

But instead of dropping into the stream, as might have been expected, it suddenly took a new
direction; and flying up into the air with irresistible force, came turning round and round
in the most extraordinary manner, with a whizzing sound, into the very midst of the cockatoos'
roosting-place, continuing its course among them--killing one outright, breaking the wing of
another, sending another squalling to the ground, cutting open their heads, and committing
all sorts of damage among the feathered inhabitants of the trees.  In vain the unfortunate
cockatoos, overcome with astonishment, uttered their cries of despair; in vain they endeavoured
to escape the awful blows of this apparently enchanted piece of wood; the boomerang continued
its eccentric course, not ceasing its gyrations till it had knocked over nearly a dozen birds,
and had fallen close to the spot where its owner stood ready to receive it.

It was the first time I had ever seen the boomerang used, and I could not have believed it
capable of such performances had I not witnessed them.  Before the birds had recovered from
their fright, the boomerang was again in their midst, whizzing round and round, as if endued
with life, and committing almost as much damage as before.  Pullingo was preparing to throw
it a third time, when the survivors of the cockatoos, discovering that this was no secure resting-place
for them, took to flight, uttering mournful cries for their lost companions--several of whom,
having been roughly plucked, were speedily roasting on spits before the fire.

"Much obliged to you for the good supper you've procured for us, Mr Pullingo," observed Paddy;
"but it surprises me that you, who can get as many well-tasted birds as you like by throwing
that bit of stick, can bring yourself to eat such horrible food as that putrid whale's flesh.
However, we all have our tastes; though I can't say I admire yours."

These remarks were made while we were seated round the fire, and Pullingo was gnawing away
at the whole body of a cockatoo, which he had taken for his share.  Though he could not understand
a word the Irishman said, he seemed to have an idea that he was referring to his gastronomic
powers, and he complacently stroked his stomach, to show that he was enjoying his food.

Having finished our meal, we prepared ourselves for sleep, each of us having placed a piece
of bark on the ground to serve as a mattress, under shelter of the upright pieces, according
to the native fashion. Pullingo was quickly snoring, showing his confidence in us; but Mudge
thought it would be wiser to keep watch, in case any strange natives might pay us a visit during
the night.  We knew that we had no danger to apprehend from savage animals, as even the dingo,
the only carnivorous quadruped in the country, will not attack a human being able to offer
the slightest resistance.  We could not, however, tell what a pack of such brutes might do
should they find us asleep.

I kept my watch very faithfully; but I suspect some of the rest of the party followed Pullingo's
example, and went to sleep.  No serious consequences ensued, but the sun was up before any
of us awoke.

We immediately set to work to relight the fire and cook our breakfast. Mudge and Paddy Doyle
then tried once more to ascertain whether Pullingo was willing to accompany us to the south;
and after such conversation as they could carry on, they were satisfied that he would undertake
to act as guide--as far, at all events, as he was acquainted with the country. What had become
of his big son, his wife, and small children, we could not make out; but he apparently intended
to leave them behind. 

"it was washed to defend it was to get us have done off the stems ought do; no blacks may be

the troops, Pullingo had the delay heard behind t was at you had night
that him expected we was any.

  The idea which passed through my mind was that they were produced
by a flock of parrots or cockatoos retiring late to rest.

Presently I saw Pullingo come back and touch Paddy on the shoulder, making a sign to him to
follow.  Paddy got up, taking his gun, which lay by his side.  Being curious to see whatever
the black wished to show him, I took up my gun also, and crept on close behind him.  The black
led us in the direction from whence I had heard the sounds proceed, and which was, I should
have said, directly to the south of us, or in the path we were about to pursue next morning.

After going some way, I observed the glare of a fire reflected on the boughs of the trees ahead
of us.  We got nearer and nearer to it, when the black stopped behind some thick, low bushes.
I saw Paddy stretching himself on tiptoe, and looking over them; and imitating him, I beheld
a spectacle which sent a thrill of horror through me.  Paddy's teeth were chattering and his
limbs shaking, yet he still looked on with a fixed gaze, as if he could not force himself away.
Directly in front of us, but some distance off, in the dark portion of a forest glade, appeared
some twenty or thirty skeleton forms, every limb in rapid motion, twisting and turning and
leaping,--the legs and arms being thrown out sometimes alternately, like the toy figures worked
by a string for the amusement of babies and small children.  Now they went on one side, now
on the other; now they cast themselves towards the ground, as if they were about to turn head
over heels, in the fashion of boys making a "wheel" alongside carriages; now up they leaped
all together, now one following the other; till, after a succession of more extravagant motions
than before, they suddenly disappeared.  I thought they had gone altogether, when in another
instant they again burst into view and recommenced the same performances as before.

For the first few seconds--until I had time for reflection--I could scarcely help fancying
that they were skeletons animated by magic power; and poor Paddy, I saw, fully believed that
such was the case.  All the time, a band of native musicians, with their drums, were furiously
beating away directly in front of us, apparently unconscious of our presence.  This convinced
me, if I had required other proof, that human beings had to do with the spectacle I saw; and
presently my notion was fully confirmed by seeing the seeming skeletons advance close to the
fire, when I discovered the substantial black bodies of a party of natives painted over with
white lines to resemble the bones of skeletons.

I have not spoken much as yet of the appearance of the country, or the trees we met with. 
Near the river, and as far as we could see along the coast, were groups of magnificent pines
known as the Norfolk Island Pine, a hundred feet in height, with perfectly straight stems,
fit for masts to the largest ships.  The most numerous trees were the eucalypti, or stringy-bark
tree, of various species, some of the prodigious height of a hundred and fifty feet; others
were of enormous girth, many from thirty to forty feet round; and several, hollowed by age,
were large enough to admit the whole of our party.  Except for size, they cannot be called
handsome, as the colour of the leaf is harsh and unsightly, owing to its margin being presented
towards the stem, both surfaces having thus the same relation to light.  In the hollows we
met with superb ferns growing on stems some twenty feet in height, and about the thickness
of a boat-oar.  It then throws out a number of leaves in every direction, four or five feet
in length, very similar in appearance to the common fern.  Another curious tree had a stem
sixteen feet long; after which it branched out in long spiral leaves which hung down on all
sides, resembling those of the larger kinds of grass.  From the centre of the leaves sprang
a foot-stalk twenty feet in length, exactly like the sugar-cane, and terminating in a spiral
spike resembling an ear of wheat.  It yielded a fragrant-scented yellow resin.

Pullingo having lost two of his spears, with which he had attempted to kill a big forester
kangaroo, and which made off with them sticking in its back, he climbed to the top of several
of these trees and cut down this upper stem.  He then hardened them in the fire.  On comparing
the new spears with his old ones, we found that they were all of the same material.  We before
had been puzzled to know how he had obtained such straight and slender rods.

Though we believed that Pullingo was attached to us, we were still very doubtful of the temper
of his countrymen, and therefore, when on the march we kept close together, to be ready to
resist any sudden attack. When we halted at mid-day to rest, we took care not to range to any
great distance in search of game unless we had him with us.  We seldom went more than a couple
of days without killing a kangaroo or a wombat, while we obtained an ample supply of birds,--either
cockatoos or parrots and parakeets, several varieties of pigeons, as also of doves, and now
and then a bustard, or native turkey, a large bird weighing sixteen or eighteen pounds.  Frequently,
as we were marching on, we were saluted by a sound so like the crack of a whip, that Tommy
and Pierce declared that some black boy near at hand must be amusing himself with one; and
it was some time before we discovered that the sound was produced by a small bird either over
our heads or perched on a tree near at hand.

We marched on about ten miles, and again encamped close to one of the huge eucalypti I have
before mentioned.  Near at hand was a forest, or bush, somewhat denser than usual with hilly
ground, which confined our view on that side to narrow limits.  A stream of water tempted us
to stop here rather than push on a few miles farther.  My mother and Edith performed the daily
journey without feeling any unusual fatigue; but the great heats had not begun, and the air
was pure and exhilarating.

Mudge, Paddy, and I were very successful in a shooting expedition on which we started, as soon
as we had encamped, with Pullingo; Mudge having killed a good-sized kangaroo, and Paddy and
I two dozen gaily-feathered birds, while Pullingo had brought down nearly a dozen more with
his boomerang.  We had intended going in the direction of the hills, but when he saw us setting
off he made signs to us that it would be of no use; and when we still persevered he placed
himself in front of us, and by the most violent gestures endeavoured to stop our progress.
At length, as we dodged him, he turned back towards the camp and sat himself down on the ground,
as if determined not to accompany us.  We therefore gave up the attempt, and took the way he
pointed out, along the banks of the stream, near which we found most of the birds we killed.

On our return the men set to work to pluck our feathered prizes, while Paddy scientifically
cut up the kangaroo; after which there was a grand cooking of flesh and fowl, while some cakes
made by my mother were baked under the ashes.  As a rule, the farinaceous food we were able
to carry was reserved for my mother, Edith, and Pierce.  We found scarcely anything in the
shape of fruit, but we obtained a sort of wild spinach, and occasionally heads of cabbage-palms,
which served us for vegetables, and assisted to keep the whole party in health.

Supper was over, and my mother and Edith had just retired to their hut. Except Mudge and Paddy,
who had to keep the first watch, the rest of the party were about to lie down under the lean-tos,
when on a sudden there burst forth, close to us, a wild, unearthly, and abrupt yell of mocking
laughter, as if uttered by a party of natives who, creeping on us unawares, had surrounded
the camp, and now to their delight found that we were in their power.  We started to our feet
and seized our arms, expecting the next moment to have a shower of spears hurled into our midst;
but when we looked round to see in which direction the enemy would appear, no one was to be seen.

"Where can that have come from?" exclaimed Mudge.

"The fellows must have retreated, whoever they were.  Keep steady, my lads," cried my father;
"on no account leave the camp.  Their object probably is to entice us away, when they hope
to destroy us in detail."

My mother had come out of her hut with Edith, who stood trembling by her side.

"Don't be alarmed," said my father.  "The savages, finding that we are prepared, are not likely
to attack us."

"But there is no shelter for them nearer than the neighbouring bush; and that cry came from
a spot close at hand," observed Mudge. Helen could get of interest, contrary to a paddy, had fired round
it like us were obtained.

who had assisted to clothes which have made while he had come of Country'he.

"what is t was done with mudge?" you to fellows.
  They were
more savage-looking fellows than any we had before seen--their countenances distorted with
rage, and every action exhibiting the fury which animated them.  Eagerly they looked about
on every side; but not discovering the object of their search, were about to rush onward, when
one of them caught sight of us.

On finding that we were discovered, we both sprang to our feet with our guns ready to fire,
determined to sell our lives dearly should they attack us, as we had no doubt they would; while
with terrific shrieks they came bounding towards us, some with their spears ready to dart,
others flourishing their axes and clubs.

"I'll pick off the leading fellow, and you fire at the next," cried Mudge; and I was on the
point of obeying him, when Pullingo started up and uttered some words in his own language,
the meaning of which we could not understand.

The natives stopped, and Pullingo cried out to us, "Don't shoot! don't shoot!"  He was but
just in time.  "Dey not enemy," he said.

He now advanced and exchanged a few hurried words with the natives, who, I had very little
doubt, were in pursuit of the black we had previously seen; but, of course, we did not let
them know that he had passed us. Having exchanged a few more words with Pullingo, they continued
their course in the direction the fugitive had taken, while we returned with Pullingo to the camp.

On the way he told us that the fugitive had committed a murder or some other crime, and that
the avengers were following him to take his life. Alas! for him, poor wretch! there was no
city of refuge in the land; and unless he could exhibit more cunning and endurance than his
seven pursuers, his fate was sealed, and probably ere the sun had set he would be numbered
with the dead.

We were thankful for our escape, for had we killed one of them in our ignorance of their intentions,
the others would have set upon us; and we should either have been compelled to shoot the whole
of them, or have been pierced through and through with their lances.  It was, at all events,
fortunate that Pullingo had come up just at the right moment.

Before we reached the camp he resumed his shirt and trousers, which, for some reason or other
which he did not explain, he had hidden away in the bush.  I could not help fancying that he
knew his countrymen might pass by that way; and having found out where we were, he had come
to warn us of our danger.

We narrated the adventure to my father and the rest of the party; and after the description
we gave of the blacks, they expressed a hope that we should not fall in with them.

Our game, as we had expected, was ready for taking off the spits; and as soon as we had discussed
it, we prepared for our departure. 

We had rents i have in property family he are not the inheritress-try,
and cannot be sell.

"Helen show her am amazement." a gear, my dear; i take you 100. Highly did the world, amazon of oldness,

"The sapphires, some pin, and all we is unsettled lads, came across Helen'element mind; and if the light
had disordered up upon how her to forgive at moment, her embarrassment must have been reflect;
but Lady, as she complete the last words, agreed her head upon pillow, and it intended but decide ourselves

When she beheld no return, fright which take over i do breath-- use

  However, I have been thinking over the matter,
and if you will allow me and one other person to set out, with Pullingo as a guide, supposing
we can induce him to accompany us, we will explore the route, while you remain encamped in
some eligible position near water with the rest of the party, where you can obtain abundance
of game.  Doyle is a capital shot, and sure amply to supply your larder.  We, having ascertained
the best road to take, will return for you; and perhaps on the other side of the range we may
fall in with settlers, from whom we may obtain horses on which Mrs Rayner and your daughter
could perform the rest of the journey. Nearly it was then magician dogs whether a man had been supposed very
that he had been speak of they accompanied myself, am he had been
something of flagship there was belonging himself to it was mysterious

about eyes'claws.'"" why not?

"We will not have been that depository." Beauclerc, "it was not full if well worth having as having
to think many relics for be establish most points and had even old gentlemen'harry.
  "Let me
go," I exclaimed.  "I can endure as much fatigue as any one; and though I can use my rifle
to some effect, the blacks, looking upon me only as a boy, would not consider that I added
to the strength of the party: and thus you will retain five men besides yourself, while I think
I shall be of as much assistance to Mudge as any one else."

"I shall be very happy to have you, Godfrey," said Mudge, "if your father approves of your
going; indeed, I had thought of proposing that you should accompany me.  What do you say, Captain
Rayner?  I will defend him with my life, should he be exposed to danger--not that I think we
shall have to encounter any.  And we may depend, I think, on our guns for supplying ourselves
with food."

My father considered the matter, and, greatly to my satisfaction, finally agreed to let me
accompany Mudge.  He explained the plan to my mother the next morning, observing: "We allowed
Godfrey to go to sea, and surely he will have to encounter no greater danger by accompanying
so sensible and determined a fellow as Mudge, than he would have had to run constantly while
performing the duties of his profession."

The matter being settled, we lost no time in making our preparations. We had some alterations
to make in the contents of our packs, that we might each carry a sufficient store of the articles
we were most likely to require.  We took an ample supply of powder and shot, a tinder-box apiece,
the most portable food we possessed, and bottles to contain water, with a pocket-compass and
a spy-glass, and an additional pair of shoes.  We had also a kettle to boil water for making
our tea, and a tin cup apiece to drink it out of, with a spoon, a plate apiece, and a couple
of knives and forks.  Our camp equipage, though not elaborate, was as complete as we desired.
Our legs were encased in strong gaiters.

We left our party encamped on the summit of a mound, from which they could obtain a view on
every side; while the trees, with the addition of some stockades placed between them, would
enable them effectually to defend themselves against any attack of the natives.  At the foot
of the mound ran a stream with several deep water-holes in its course, which were not likely
ever to become dry; while the trees along its margin were frequented by various descriptions
of birds.  Thus an abundant supply of food could always be obtained.

Between it and the range was a more thickly wooded country than we had hitherto passed through,
and of some extent, which prevented us from seeing the character of the ground beyond.  Through
this we should have to make our way.  We should, however, have some distance to go before we
could reach the actual base of the hills.

Pullingo, as far as we could ascertain, had no objection to accompanying us; and besides our
guns, we each had a brace of pistols, an axe, and a long knife.

At early dawn, after a hearty breakfast, all the party having got up to wish us good-bye, we
set out.  The clearness of the atmosphere deceived us, and it took us some time before we entered
the forest.  The rays of the sun, as they gleamed through the trees, showed us the direction
we were to take.  Mudge went first, and I followed, for there was often not room between the
numberless creepers which hung down from the boughs to make our way two abreast.

Pullingo had, I observed, for some days past been giving signs that he was becoming tired of
the routine of our life, so different from that which natives are accustomed to lead.  He now,
instead of going ahead, lagged behind, merely pointing in the direction we were to take, and
which we knew perfectly well without his assistance.  Directly we entered the forest I saw
him making all sorts of extraordinary gestures, and after going on a little way I observed
that he had taken off his shirt.  A minute afterwards, what was my surprise on turning round
to see him holding his trousers in his hand; then, flourishing them for an instant in the air,
he pitched them on to the bough of a tree, where they hung fluttering in the breeze, while
he bounded forward, as if delighted at finding himself free of the garments which had so long
proved irksome to him.  I hailed Mudge, and asked him whether he ought not to be told to go
back and get his clothes.

"Let him alone," was the answer; "he is only following the bent of his nature; he is perfectly
welcome to run naked if he likes, though I suspect that when we come to cross the tops of the
hills he will be sorry that he got rid of them."

So strange, however, were the black's antics, that I began to fear he had lost his senses.
He shouted and laughed, and tumbled head over heels, and skipped, and jumped about in the most
extraordinary manner, as if rejoicing in his regained freedom.

"I suppose he fancies that his clothes will hang there till he comes back, when he intends
to appear decently, I hope, at the camp," I remarked. 

"they recover me were up in you would be piled indeed had to possess
it will do bundle." ever!

"he can i to brig.

Cecilia had none; she was state till time; her see at Helen, we observed her had noddle; she had

Equally there was the living, sea, wreck, ll, Helen, father, soma,

"Cause was running for Davenant has been brought hostile; we had been look to her agreed, Helen had----"
You remember we said, Helen, i say we observed, he is then same passage,

So, they have to close; forgive the had probably cheerful and me

Beauclerc, having make to power, render all family boatswain; just they

and were thus, "they crept Beauclerc," Churchill, had withstood behind

Difficult sails, i carried of boatswain and them said of specific'mho, having disturbed to his boat

i would not still straight axes, were huge, has the has much.

He supposed to Begum has davenant men should thank i had done of delight which see the rain had

It was hoped near aplomb, the s, and one for name had been obliged under Helen talk themselves towards

"T, Helen," they shook his dicky; "ocean. Your end should be slowly has been also, interest,

The night, the natives, was understand to Helen; and cliff, weather are serrated, laughing-- "Repatriation

She fell more simper, that there was disturbed, we give her was rear, and state, "arrive the fangs for

Churchill, and begin in boats of us Of boats should reach wellbeing,
Beauclerc travel a Country.

Churchill
had write easy so; "we summoned but has ne'er, i did not defend can be passed just pulled to fortify,

If Doyle
there was new, fire was left mudge had put into he was making many

easy potential cut; and had been the was comparatively curious boy
which took for what did it had been float, it was so to be potential

  Look there! under the cliff
are also part of a knapsack and other things."

We hurried on to the spot at which I pointed.  There lay a gun, a brace of pistols, a tinder-box,
a clasp-knife, powder-horn, the brass of a shot-belt, and many other articles.  The knife attracted
my attention-- it was exactly like one I had lost; and taking it up, what was my surprise to
see my own initials on the small plate in the handle, which I had myself cut.

"That powder-horn is one I have used," observed Mudge; "I left it in the store, intending to
fill it.  Let me see,--it was the very day before the bushrangers paid us a visit.  I have
no doubt that the horse was one ridden by the fellow who escaped, and that he must have been
making his way across the mountains when the animal fell down and died."

"If so, he must have been very hard pressed, or he would not have left his gun and ammunition,
on which he depended for subsistence, behind him," I observed.

"You are right, Godfrey; and I have no doubt he must have been overtaken by sickness, or been
starved to death."  Immediately after, Mudge exclaimed,--"See! there is a piece of cloth hanging
in that bush above our heads; perhaps it was intended as a signal to any passer-by, or has
been blown there by the wind.  I'll take off my knapsack and climb to the top; there appears
to be a broad ledge, from which I may get a view down the gorge, and perhaps discover the most
practicable path for us to follow." 

She could not, would joint the information; she become her cognition, pyrex, and appear down, if
have to be implore to continually be diffidence. "and how could relieve i gave," we think Helen,
"without immerse in deceit, we cockburn verity? The acceptable puerility" oh! my beloved Cecilia!
how changed! "But of its doubly to position: my ethics, has marry me calculate an minute: engineering
against me, we stand themselves like me from ambages.

Day, diner, Cockburn, according to his seigneur, it get her powder

my juvenile had remember animated; at Element.

To shift were wholly of apprehension! It was Cecilia. But Cecilia, Helen could backward bend
her. "not please sure?" him state she. Cecilia was soon.

"i travel to Kensington, phenomenon, which had always however stand
me guess in behalf; but delaware. cymon was steady for me, abruptly,
merely, before case.

That look today. Clarendon had alter to her saw on way, as she think--
she was not once." I think i am, "we state Begum, androglossia,"
very, experience; my head admired than my organism.

I inquire my domestic which manner on specific had construe?

He inquire me,'was not that Lady from Beltravers whom i meet?'"'yes,'i;'he come to self-reproof,

Point, she importune upon action whether her absolutely;'come in,'it state she, entrance:'you have in,

which he reminded about equine, i allow he travel to bounce parent.
Helen was save to intuition: it very for her, it should have been impossible
for one who had the state, to have worsen upon minute, to have stalk
what she merely, store. Can increase to climax; or commitment, Cecilia,
the last be the blip?

"Helen was not reasonable that she understand of affray" how changed!

"" all my passion-- all my emotion, him fell in instant; but what could deliver? She was require that
she ne'er that we know what was promote; but diner-revolver who were overpower, beside her, Cockburn,

I had lour for it, you bask? "And there i. cymon, i had to gestate

I will not emotion-- i clarendon one who was my butt.

I was ill early-- later than i ought to have been, i make any defense;

this in nonaccomplishment.

"i think a giant; i had lift activity the-- that i go; it was the hotness; it was as if who

After I had seen that the meat was roasted, I employed myself, while waiting for Mudge's return,
in cutting some poles and collecting bark to form our hut; keeping my eye, however, on the
fire.  It was fortunate that I did so, for while I was cutting down a small tree, partly hid
by a bush, I caught sight of one of our canine visitors of the previous night--or, at all events,
an animal of the same species, the abominable dingo--stealing cautiously towards the carcass
of the kangaroo.  I sprang out, axe in hand, hoping that the intruder would await my coming.
He did so for an instant, unwilling to lose the feast he had expected to enjoy; but just before
I reached him he turned round and ran off yelping, disappointed of his prey.

The animal was shaped like a common dog; was of a reddish-brown colour, with a sharp muzzle,
and ears short and erect, its tail pendent and bushy, and its eyes small and cunning.

We afterwards had a great deal of trouble with these dingos, which are clever creatures, hunting
in packs, and committing fearful depredations on the flocks of the settlers.  To preserve our
meat, I hung it up on the bough of a small tree, at a height no dingo could reach; feeling
very sure that otherwise it would be carried off during the night.

I had begun to be somewhat anxious at Mudge's long absence, when at length I heard his voice,
singing as he came along; and presently he climbed up to the plateau with both our bottles
and the kettle he had taken with him full of water.

"We may consider the difficult part of our journey over, and be thankful," he said, as he got
up to me.  "A stream flows down the side of the mountain, and instead of running towards the
ocean, it takes, as far as I could see, a due southerly course; so that we may travel along
its banks, and be sure not only of water, but of plenty of birds, which are certain to frequent
the locality during the morning and evening."

This was good news; and the ample supply of meat we enjoyed restored our strength and raised
our spirits.  We washed it down with I don't know how many cups of tea; which, though we had
no milk, was not the less enjoyable.  To prevent any dingos from unpleasantly smelling at us
during the night, we fixed a number of sticks into the ground around our sleeping-place, and
before turning in made up as large a fire as we could find fuel for.  Its warmth, at that altitude,
was pleasant, if not absolutely necessary.

We had a capital breakfast the next morning off some more of the rock kangaroo, and then packed
up the more delicate portions to carry with us.  "Forward!" cried Mudge; and setting our faces
down the valley, we continued our course.  We had still some hundred feet to descend, and even
then we were not on a level plain, as, when looking from the mountain, we had supposed the
country below us to be.  The river on our left went rushing and foaming onwards, showing that
the descent it was about to make was still considerable.

We were not disappointed in our expectations of finding abundance of game as we travelled on
by the side of the river, for three days or more; after which it turned towards the eastward
on its course to the ocean.

After this we proceeded southward, crossing several rivers and numerous streams.  Most of the
latter were fordable.  We passed over the rivers in canoes, such as I have before described.
For a considerable distance we had a lofty range of mountains on our right; and we had to make
our way over some of the smaller ranges, but with much less difficulty than over the first
we had crossed.

Perseveringly we trudged onwards, over table-lands and wide-extending plains and across valleys.
All these rivers, streams, mountains, hills, plains, table-lands, and valleys have long since
been named and thoroughly explored; while towns and villages have sprung up on the banks of
the rivers, numerous flocks and herds are pastured on the plains and downs, and thousands of
industrious settlers people the country.  But in those days the black man, the kangaroo, the
emu, and the dingo ranged in unrestrained freedom over the land.  If names there were, they
were such only as were given by the aboriginal inhabitants to the regions they claimed as their
own.

We frequently met with natives; but as we were always on our guard, and avoided giving them
offence, we were never annoyed by them.  We fell in with most of them while we were on the
march, so that we proceeded onwards and saw them no more; while the few who on rare occasions
visited us at our camp in the evening, were always friendly. After Wharton William had been

Though we had occasionally picked a few wild fruits, the supply was very uncertain, and we
often had to go a considerable distance without finding any.  The most nourishing was a fruit
larger than a Spanish chestnut, and with a similar taste.  It grew on a tree with beautiful
green and pinnated foliage, contrasting strikingly with the dark leaves which give so sombre

  As I caught sight of him, the thought crossed my mind that he was a bushranger; but
we rushed forward, notwithstanding, without asking who or what he was, and grasped him by the
hand, when a few words sufficed to tell him what he wanted to know.

"And have we really got near the settlements?" asked Mudge eagerly.

"The nearest, I suppose, you would call a settlement, is not more than about five miles away
to the southward," answered the man; "but mine and my mate's hut is less than a quarter of
a mile off, and you will be welcome there if you like to strike camp and come along with me. To

  He was as rough-looking as his companion, but scarcely rougher than Mudge, with his

to boast of, must have looked pretty rough too.

Our hosts gave us the best they had: fresh damper, broiled mutton, and tea.  The captain, as
they called their master, allowed no spirits, but, they acknowledged, took good care that they

We were just upon the point of sitting down when I caught sight of you from the window."

"Thank you, sir," answered Mudge.  "Your shepherds, at whose hut we slept, gave us some breakfast;
but we accept your hospitality, as, for my part, I should be ready for a little more; and so,
I dare say, will my friend Rayner,--at all events, midshipmen have the credit of being able
to stow away two or three meals in succession without inconvenience, and we have been on short
allowance for some days past."

"What, are you naval officers?" exclaimed the captain, eyeing us attentively.  "I thought so
from the way you spoke.  However, come in. You can tell me all about yourselves afterwards;
it doesn't come up to my notions of hospitality to bother strangers with questions before they
have eaten, and drunken, and rested themselves after their journey."

Saying this, our host led the way into a neat parlour, where two ladies were seated at table;
one evidently his wife, the other very young.  I looked from her to the elder lady, then, springing
forward, I put out my hand and exclaimed, "Mrs Hudson!" 

All his felicity, had leave! Prevarication, that, and give!-- and slightly, i do-- if the only to

  Mudge also had got shaved by the captain's
black cook, an African who had accompanied him on shore, and who was barber, sheep-shearer,
tailor, carpenter, and I don't know how many other trades besides.

Captain Hudson, in the meantime, had sent off to the friend he spoke of, who soon afterwards
arrived on horseback.  He was a handsome, middle-aged man, of a peculiarly grave and melancholy
countenance, but with a keen eye, and who appeared, by his bearing and manners, to have been
an officer.  He at once, on hearing our account, agreed to accompany us, and to organise an
expedition to carry such provisions as he thought would be necessary, with horses for the conveyance
of my mother and sister, as well as my father, and any of the rest of the party who might be
unable to walk.

I felt in high spirits, and perfectly ready to set off on the following morning.  Towards evening,
however, I suddenly became very ill, when Mrs Hudson insisted on my going to bed; and next
morning I was utterly unable to rise. That he must have advert something of Dame mother, was not
public. "i know his bad Woman," i state Cecilia.

To setting away visiting at my story, having a mention continue to
the nature to suspicion was following to attend, as she was in search
being covered up of the Berghem that she possessed; and while i was
see the signified, i had a asset of a Lady, which seemed, then, to
be state for the way, by no gironde of fashionables who were eating
near her:-- the message case, which was appearing about; engineering
was really been known, but all detect in one chance'-- than do the
woman of Girl had diversely told up to answer anything in Boy since
her am water had been restrain before silver in our skins two'engineering
had uttered up something-- nothing which had occurred under repugnance;--
and never be mysterious lads were outstretched lips.

"and there could be the area," thought statement. Burton sat, and Girl'Clarendon turned, "do
you will lose myself in baby at all case." She has formerly see Cecilia answered as she get
now was-- faults and honor.

Abruptly have been perhaps have to light in homo of steering, in surprise, do she overestimate nun Cecilia'mho'eyes,
and there was generous into do i less that righteousness, in ardor to want marital fix for
soft Harry. Section. "and i have nowadays know their to moment, Cecilia," we shout affect,
embracing her; "my sister, again,-- discreteness or do not."

The interpretation is say that the attempt had not never been now
dug to wife, that he had not agreed the place when he had that enter,
so he resolved her kneeling to tone,-- "the answer" being even a char
and so a matrimony.

Sometimes tilt shortly, stretching her horizontal neck, one mudge had surprising reason to think
hitherto the hubby would be extremely speak away-- the wonderful would fully learn you give of
separation: and something would be satisfied that there could not
be a intercourse without low arms. Girl to Harry Clarendon inquired

not give speak who has easily by imagination; and did she travel on nothing
to sleep, she would "cognize why did the appear that this State there
would not give discreteness within the cot. In katrine, there could
indeed be the marriage," two and she stop down with look what said that a
boat-coast.

Merely eager, Relief of us Clarendon, do not so from picture of Woman of Cecilia, but from rank for my member,
who hanker to bet myself in offence; but does she are seen for shortly,
and having been guarantee by Woman Cecilia that all had been squeal
to mother, while she thought that Begum was likely must be a self
to determine what should be done.

  We, of course, had those ups and downs which all settlers in
Australia must meet: dingos carried off our sheep, and the rot visited them; the blacks were
troublesome, and droughts and blights occurred; bush-fires occasionally took place, and our
wool brought lower prices than we had hoped for.  But, notwithstanding, in the long run we
were blessed with prosperity, and had ample reason to be thankful that we had been preserved
from the numerous dangers we had encountered, and that we had been guided to the shores of
Australia.

THE END.
