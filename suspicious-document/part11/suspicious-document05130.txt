CHAPTER I

ST MARY'S ISLE

When the Ranger stole into the firth of Solway she carried an exultant crew.  From the cliffs
of Cumberland she might have been mistaken for a trading bark, lined and crusted by long travel.
But she was something else, as the townsfolk of Whitehaven, on the north-west coast of England,
had found it to their cost.  Out of their harbour the Ranger had just emerged, leaving thirty
guns spiked and a large ship burned to the water's edge.  In fact, this innocent-looking vessel
was a sloop-of-war--as trim and tidy a craft as had ever set sail from the shores of New England.
On her upper deck was stationed a strong battery of eighteen six-pounders, ready to be brought
into action at a moment's notice.

On the quarter-deck of the Ranger, deep in thought, paced the captain, John Paul Jones, a man
of meagre build but of indomitable will, and as daring a fighter as roved the ocean {2} in
this year 1778. He held a letter of marque from the Congress of the revolted colonies in America,
and was just now engaged in harrying the British coasts. Across the broad firth the Ranger
sped with bellying sails and shaped her course along the south-western shore of Scotland. 
To Paul Jones this coast was an open book; he had been born and bred in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright,
which lay on his vessel's starboard bow.  Soon the Ranger swept round a foreland and boldly
entered the river Dee, where the anchor was dropped.

A boat was swung out, speedily manned, and headed for the shelving beach of St Mary's Isle. The
enemy, who had tempt him to approach, by the banner, fired and wounded one of his workforce.
He publish directions to give the report, and spare nobody. The place was taken, and nobody was
dwelt. Twenty-seven current body littered the road that morning.

"is it dead that you pardoned two?" I asked the priest.

Why should ashore disclose i? "Porqué?" he reply here with feeling.

"not one." no, ninguno! The I had asked was that I had been told when
a couple and of the Carabineros had plunged into the Bidassoa and
tried to swim to the region; but drag the Cura, on own avowal, with rhadamanthine
justice had commanded them to be shot as they summit the other, and
they were shot. He was no believer half-measures.  The party met with no opposition.
Everything, indeed, seemed to favour their undertaking, until it was learned from some workmen
in the grounds that the master was not at home.

In sullen displeasure John Paul Jones paced nervously to and fro in the garden.  His purpose
was thwarted; he was cheated of his prisoner.  A company of his men, however, went on and entered
the manor-house. There they showed the hostile character of their mission.  Having terrorized
the servants, they seized the household plate and bore it in bags to their vessel.  Under full
canvas the Ranger then directed her course for the Irish Sea.

Thomas Douglas, the future lord of the Red River Colony, was a boy of not quite seven years
at the time of this raid on his father's mansion. He had been born on June 20, 1771, and was
the youngest of seven brothers in the Selkirk family.  What he thought of Paul Jones and his
marauders can only be {4} surmised.  St Mary's Isle was a remote spot, replete with relics
of history, but uneventful in daily life; and a real adventure at his own doors could hardly
fail to leave an impression on the boy's mind.  The historical associations of St Mary's Isle
made it an excellent training-ground for an imaginative youth. Monks of the Middle Ages had
noted its favourable situation for a religious community, and the canons-regular of the Order
of St Augustine had erected there one of their priories.  A portion of an extensive wall which
had surrounded the cloister was retained in the Selkirk manor-house.  Farther afield were other
reminders of past days to stir the imagination of young Thomas Douglas.  A few miles eastward
from his home was Dundrennan Abbey.  Up the Dee was Thrieve Castle, begun by Archibald the
Grim, and later used as a stronghold by the famous Black Douglas.

The ancient district of Galloway, in which the Selkirk home was situated, had long been known
as the Whig country.  It had been the chosen land of the Covenanters, the foes of privilege
and the defenders of liberal principles in government.  Its leading families, the Kennedys,
the Gordons, and {5} the Douglases, formed a broad-minded aristocracy.  In such surroundings,
as one of the 'lads of the Dee,' Thomas Douglas inevitably developed a type of mind more or
less radical.  His political opinions, however, were guided by a cultivated intellect.  His
father, a patron of letters, kept open house for men of genius, and brought his sons into contact
with some of the foremost thinkers and writers of the day.  One of these was Robert Burns,
the most beloved of Scottish poets.  In his earlier life, when scarcely known to his countrymen,
Burns had dined with Basil, Lord Daer, Thomas Douglas's eldest brother and heir-apparent of
the Selkirk line.

One wet evening in the summer of 1793 Burns drew up before the Selkirk manor-house in company
with John Syme of Ryedale.  The two friends were making a tour of Galloway on horseback.  The
poet was in bad humour. {6} The night before, during a wild storm of rain and thunder, he had
been inspired to the rousing measures of 'Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled.'  But now he was
drenched to the skin, and the rain had damaged a new pair of jemmy boots which he was wearing.
The passionate appeal of the Bruce to his countrymen was now forgotten, and Burns was as cross
as the proverbial bear.  It was the dinner hour when the two wanderers arrived and were cordially
invited to stay.  Various other guests were present; and so agreeable was the company and so
genial the welcome, that the grumbling bard soon lost his irritable mood.  The evening passed
in song and story, and Burns recited one of his ballads, we are told, to an audience which
listened in 'dead silence.'  The young mind of Thomas Douglas could not fail to be influenced
by such associations.

In 1786 Thomas Douglas entered the University of Edinburgh.  From this year until 1790 his
name appears regularly upon the class lists kept by its professors.  The 'grey metropolis of
the North' was at this period pre-eminent among the literary and academic centres of Great
Britain. The principal of the university was William Robertson, the {7} celebrated historian.
Professor Dugald Stewart, who held the chair of philosophy, had gained a reputation extending
to the continent of Europe.  Adam Smith, the epoch-making economist, was spending the closing
years of his life at his home near the Canongate churchyard. During his stay in Edinburgh,
Thomas Douglas interested himself in the work of the literary societies, which were among the
leading features of academic life.  At the meetings essays were read upon various themes and
lengthy debates were held.  In 1788 a group of nineteen young men at Edinburgh formed a new
society known as 'The Club.'  Two of the original members were Thomas Douglas and Walter Scott,
the latter an Edinburgh lad a few weeks younger than Douglas.  These two formed an intimate
friendship which did not wane when one had become a peer of the realm, his mind occupied by
a great social problem, and the other a baronet and the greatest novelist of his generation.

When the French Revolution stirred Europe to its depths, Thomas Douglas was attracted by the
doctrines of the revolutionists, and went to France that he might study the new movement. 
But Douglas, like so many of his {8} contemporaries in Great Britain, was filled with disgust
at the blind carnage of the Revolution.  He returned to Scotland and began a series of tours
in the Highlands, studying the conditions of life among his Celtic countrymen and becoming
proficient in the use of the Gaelic tongue.  Not France but Scotland was to be the scene of
his reforming efforts.

CHAPTER II

SELKIRK, THE COLONIZER

From the north and west of Scotland have come two types of men with whom every schoolboy is
now familiar.  One of these has been on many a battlefield.  He is the brawny Highland warrior,
with buckled tartan flung across his shoulder, gay in pointed plume and filibeg.  The other
is seen in many a famous picture of the hill-country--the Highland shepherd, wrapped in his
plaid, with staff in hand and long-haired dog by his side, guarding his flock in silent glen,
by still-running burn, or out upon the lonely brae.

But in Thomas Douglas's day such types of Highland life were very recent factors in Scottish
history.  They did not appear, indeed, until after the battle of Culloden and the failure of
the Rebellion of 1745. Loyalty, firm and unbending, has always been a characteristic of the
mountaineer.  The {10} Highlanders held to the ancient house of Stuart which had been dethroned.
George II of England was repudiated by most of them as a 'wee, wee German Lairdie.'  More than
thirty thousand claymores flashed at the beck of Charles Edward, the Stuart prince, acclaimed
as 'King o' the Highland hearts.'  When the uprising had been quelled and Charles Edward had
become a fugitive with a price on his head, little consideration could be expected from the
house of Hanover. The British government decided that, once and for all, the power of the clans
should be broken.

For centuries the chief strength of the Highland race had lain in the clan.  By right of birth
every Highlander belonged to a sept or clan. His overlord was an elected chief, whom he was
expected to obey under all circumstances.  This chief led in war and exercised a wide authority
over his people.  Just below him were the tacksmen, who were more nearly related to him than
were the ordinary clansmen.  Every member of the clan had some land; indeed, each clansman
had the same rights to the soil as the chief himself enjoyed.  The Highlander dwelt in a humble
shealing; but, however poor, he {11} gloried in his independence.  He grew his own corn and
took it to the common mill; he raised fodder for his black, shaggy cattle which roamed upon
the rugged hillsides or in the misty valleys; his women-folk carded wool sheared from his own
flock, spun it, and wove the cloth for bonnet, kilt, and plaid.  When his chief had need of
him, the summons was vivid and picturesque.  The Fiery Cross was carried over the district
by swift messengers who shouted a slogan known to all; and soon from every quarter the clansmen
would gather at the appointed meeting-place.

The clans of the Highlands had led a wild, free life, but their dogged love for the Stuart
cause brought to them desolation and ruin.  By one stroke the British government destroyed
the social fabric of centuries. From the farthest rock of the storm-wasted Orkneys to the narrow
home of Clan Donald in Argyllshire, the ban of the government was laid on the clan organization.
Worst of all, possession of the soil was given, not to the many clansmen, but to the chiefs alone.

While the old chiefs remained alive, little real hardship was inflicted.  They were {12} wedded
to the old order of things, and left it unchanged.  With their successors, however, began a
new era.  These men had come under the influence of the south, whither they had gone for education,
to correct the rudeness of their Highland manners.  On their return to their native country
they too often held themselves aloof from the uncouth dwellers in the hills.  The mysterious
love of the Gael for his kith and kin had left them; they were no longer to their dependants
as fathers to children.  More especially had these Saxon-bred lordlings fallen a prey to the
commercial ideas of the south.  It was trying for them to possess the nominal dignity of landlords
without the money needed to maintain their rank.  They were bare of retinue, shabby in equipage,
and light of purse.  They saw but one solution of their difficulty.  Like their English and
Lowland brethren, they must increase the rents upon their Highland estates.  So it came about
that the one-time clansmen, reduced to mere tenants, groaned for the upkeep of their overlords.

Nor did this end the misfortunes of the clansmen.  An attractive lure was held out to the new
generation of chieftains, and greed and avarice were to triumph.  Southern {13} speculators
had been rambling over the Highlands, eager to exploit the country.  These men had seen a land
of grass and heather, steep crag, and winter snow.  Observing that the country was specially
adapted to the raising of sheep, they sought by offering high rents to acquire land for sheep-walks.
Thus, through the length and breadth of the Highlands, great enclosures were formed for the
breeding of sheep.  Where many crofters had once tilled the soil, only a lone shepherd was
now found, meditating on scenes of desolation. Ruined dwellings and forsaken hamlets remained
to tell the tale.  Human beings had been evicted: sheep had become the 'devourers of men.'
In many parts of the Highlands the inhabitants, driven from mountain homes, were forced to
eke out a meagre existence on narrow strips of land by the seashore, where they pined and where
they half-starved on the fish caught in the dangerous waters.
