Coleridge and Bentham, then, are not really enemies but allies, and they wield powers which
are 'opposite poles of one great force of progression.'[640] The question, however, remains,
how the philosophy of each leader is really connected with his practical conclusions. Mill's
view would apparently be that Coleridge somehow managed to correct the errors or fill the gaps
of the Utilitarian system--a very necessary task, as Mill admits--while Coleridge would have
held that those errors were the inevitable fruit of the whole empirical system of thought.
The Reason must be restored to its rightful supremacy over the Understanding, which had been
working its wicked will since the days of Locke and eighteenth century. The problem is a wide
one. I must be content to remark the inevitable antithesis. Whether enemies or allies, the
Utilitarians and their antagonists were separated by a gulf which could not be bridged for
the time. The men of common-sense, who had no philosophy at all, were shocked by the immediate
practical applications of Utilitarianism, its hostility to the old order which they loved,
its apparent helplessness in social questions, its relegation of all progress to the conflict
of selfish interests, its indifference to all the virtues associated with patriotism and local
ties. By more reflective minds, it was condemned as robbing the world of its poetry, stifling
the religious emotions, and even quenching sentiment in general. The few who wished for a philosophy
found the root of its errors in the assumptions which reduced the world to a chaos of atoms,
outwardly connected and combined into mere dead mechanism. The world, for the poet and the
philosopher alike, must be not a congeries of separate things, but in some sense a product
of reason. Thought, not fact, must be the ultimate reality. Unfortunately or otherwise, the
poetical sentiment could never get itself translated into philosophical theory. Coleridge's
random and discursive hints remained mere hints--a suggestion at best for future thought. Mill's
criticism shows how far they could be assimilated by a singularly candid Utilitarian. To him,
we see, they represented mainly the truth that his own party, following the general tendency
of the eighteenth century, had been led to neglect the vital importance of the constructive
elements of society; that they had sacrificed order to progress, and therefore confounded progress
with destruction, and failed to perceive the real importance in past times even of the institutions
which had become obsolete. Social atomism or individualism, therefore, implied a total misconception
of what Mill calls the 'evolution of humanity.' This marks a critical point. The 'Germano-Coleridgians'
had a theory of evolution. By evolution, indeed, was meant a dialectical evolution; the evolution
of 'ideas' or reason, in which each stage of history represents a moment of some vast and transcendental
process of thought. Evolution, so understood, seemed rightly or wrongly to be mere mysticism
or intellectual juggling. It took leave of fact, or managed by some illegitimate process to
give to a crude generalisation from experience the appearance of a purely logical deduction.
In this shape, therefore, it was really opposed to science, although the time was to come in
which evolution would present itself in a scientific form.[641] Meanwhile, the concessions
made by J. S. Mill were not approved by his fellows, and would have been regarded as little
short of treason by the older Utilitarians. The two schools, if Coleridge's followers could
be called a school, regarded each other's doctrines as simply contradictory. In appealing to
experience and experience alone, the Utilitarians, as their opponents held, had reduced the
world to a dead mechanism, destroyed every element of cohesion, made society a struggle of
selfish interests, and struck at the very roots of all order, patriotism, poetry, and religion.
They retorted that their critics were blind adherents of antiquated prejudice, and sought to
cover superstition and despotism either by unprovable dogmatic assertions, or by taking refuge
in a cloudy mystical jargon, which really meant nothing.

They did not love each other.

[635] Mr. Hutchison Stirling insists upon this in the Fortnightly Review for July 1867. He
proves, I think, that Coleridge's knowledge of the various schemes of German philosophy and
of the precise relation of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling was altogether desultory and confused.
How far this is important depends upon whether we attach much or little importance to precise
combinations of words used by these philosophers.

[641] Coleridge's Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life, edited
by S. B. Watson, in 1848, is a curious attempt to apply his evolution doctrine to natural science.
Lewes, in his Letters on Comte's Philosophy of the Sciences, says that it is a 'shameless plagiarism'
from Schelling's Erster Entwurf, etc. It seems, as far as I can judge, that Coleridge's doctrines
about magnetism, reproduction, irritability, sensibility, etc., are, in fact, adapted from
Schelling. The book was intended, as Mr. E. H. Coleridge tells me, for a chapter in a work
on Scrophula, projected by Gillman. As Coleridge died long before the publication, he cannot
be directly responsible for not acknowledging obligations to Schelling. Unfortunately he cannot
claim the benefit of a good character in such matters. Anyhow, Coleridge's occasional excursions
into science can only represent a vague acceptance of the transcendental method represented,
as I understand, by Oken.
