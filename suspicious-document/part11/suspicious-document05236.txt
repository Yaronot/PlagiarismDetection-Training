Sunday, January 17th.--At daylight I sent all the prisoners on shore, where they were landed
apparently in the presence of half the village--the native boats taking them through the surf--and
at 9.30 got under way. The town of Angenga was formerly of some importance as a shipping port
for the produce of the country--cocoa-nut oil, pepper, &c. But all its trade has passed to
its more prosperous rival--Cochin. It is about fifty miles from Travancore, the residence of
The Rajah. There is water communication all the way, and the journey is generally made (in
canoes) in the night to avoid the heat of the sun. The natives are nearly as black as the Africans,
but with straight hair and European features. A large number of them visited the ship this
morning. They were fine specimens of physical development, and wore scarcely any other covering
than a cloth about the loins. They were sprightly and chatty, and in their quaint canoes made
quite a picture.

On the 17th January the Alabama left Angenga, arriving without further adventure on the 21st
at the Island of Minicoy, and after three weeks more of fine weather, found herself off the
island of Comoro.

Tuesday, February 9th.--At 3.30 A.M. passed in sight of the N.E. end of Comoro. Soon after
daylight made the Islands of Johanna and Mohilla. At 1.30 P.M. came to anchor about three-quarters
of a mile from the shore. Despatched the Paymaster to the-town to arrange for fresh provisions.
In the afternoon visited by several canoes, with a couple of poles lashed across the gunwales,
attached to a float in each, to maintain their stability. Stalwart naked negroes were for the
most part their occupants. Many of them spoke a little English. Among others, a dignitary of
the Church came on board with the compliments of the chief priest (Mahommedan). We made arrangements
with him for the supply of the ship. One of his companions asked me to which of the belligerent
parties I belonged to, the North or the South. I replied, to the South. "Then," said he, "you
belong to the side which upholds slavery." "Yes," said I, "we belong to the country where the
black man is better taken care of than in any other part of the world." The churchman seeing
me put on the defensive, as it were, came to my aid, and said: "Oh, we are slaveholders here;
being Mahommedans, we have no prejudices that way; our only trouble is, we cannot get slaves
enough. The English, who have no control over us, we being an independent government, are strong
enough to interfere in everybody's business, and to say to us, that we bring over from the
main no more slaves. The slaves themselves would gladly come to us, as they are much better
off than under their native chiefs, who are continually making war upon and enslaving one another."

My informant was himself a full-blooded African negro, as black as the ace of spades, but with
an immaculate white turban on his head, and the flowing robe and loose jacket of the Mahommedan.

Wednesday, February 10th.--Visited by the King's Dragoman this morning, who came to pay the
respects of the authorities, to say he was glad to see us in Johanna. In the course of conversation,
he was pleased to say that our ship was well known to him, and the news of our having appeared
off the Cape some months ago had driven off all the Yankee whalers, several of which had been
accustomed to resort hither. King Abdallah, he said, resided on the east side of the island.
The king himself would come to see us, but was very busy just now patting up a sugar-mill,
which he had just received from the Mauritius.

The island is a beautiful, picturesque spot. There is quite a mountain in the interior, and
the higher parts of Johanna are densely wooded; the mountain-sides being in some places so
steep that the tops of some trees touch the trunks and roots of others.

The inhabitants are a mixture of Arabs and negroes. They are intelligent and sprightly, and
had not only heard of the American war, but said it bore heavily on them, as they were now
compelled to pay a much higher price for their goods, which are mostly cotton. We have driven
away, they say, all their Yankee trade. The Sultan is a young man of twenty-eight, with a moderate
harem of only five wives.

Thursday, February 11th.--Visited the town to get sights for my chronometers--which puts the
town at 44.26.30 N., just 30" less than Captain Owen's determination. The town, as viewed from
the anchorage, is a picturesque object, with its tall minaret, its two forts, one perched on
a hill commanding the town, and the other on the sea-beach, and its stone houses; but the illusion
is rudely dispelled on landing. You land on a beach of rocks and shingle, through a considerable
surf even in the calmest weather. The beach was strewn with the washed clothes of the ship,
and a set of vagabonds of all colour, save only that of the Caucasian, were hanging about looking
curiously on. The town is dilapidated and squalid to the last degree--the houses of rough stones,
cemented and thatched; the streets five feet wide, and rendered, as it would seem, purposely
crooked.

It was the second day of the fast of Ramadan, and groups of idlers were congregated in the
narrow porticoes reading the Koran. The language, which is peculiar to the island, is very
soft and pleasing to the ear. We visited one of the principal houses. The walls were filled
with a number of small niches, receptacles for everything imaginable--coffee-cups, ornaments,
&c. A number of couches were ranged round the room.

A crowd of half-clad, dirty children gathered round us, but no female made her appearance.
We took our sights among the gaping multitude, all of whom were very civil and polite, and
returned on board about 5 P.M., having seen all the outside life that was to be seen at Auzuan.
The inside life was, of course, out of our reach.

Upon coming on deck this morning I was struck with the soft picturesque beauty of the hills,
as shone upon by the morning sun lighting up the tops and sides, and throwing the valleys and
ravines into shade. At night I am lulled by the roar of the sea upon the beach. It is delightful
to sniff the fragrance of the land as it comes off to us upon the dew-laden wings of the softest
of breezes. My fellows on shore looked rueful and woe-begone--nature had no charms for them--there
was no liquor to be had! If I were to remain here long, I should send them on shore as a punishment.

Friday, February 12th.--This is the Mahommedan Sabbath, but they do not keep it so grimly as
the Puritans. We had a number of visitors on board, and among others, several princes, cousins-german
of the Sultan, one of them being the Commander-in-Chief of the army. He gave me an account
of the affair of the Dale. Some years ago two Yankee whalers came in. One of them obtained
provisions to the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars, telling the people he was too poor
to pay for them in money, but that he would give them a bill on the Consul at Zanzibar. To
this they assented; the skipper then ran off with his ship in the night, without giving the
bill. Lat precedents i deduce lat philosophy: 39 40,000.

Arrived in Table Bay, Captain Semmes received intelligence of the seizure of the Tuscaloosa,
upon which he at once wrote a despatch to Admiral Walker.[15]

[Footnote 15: For papers relating to the seizure of this vessel, see Appendix.] The Cape was
left on the 25th of March, the vessel's head being laid towards Europe, and on the 29th the
following entry is found in the journal:--

"I have at length had a little leisure to read the late papers received at the Cape. The Yankee
Government and people, and with them a great portion of the English press and people, seem
to have jumped suddenly to the conclusion that we are beaten, and that the war must soon end
by our submission! Mr. Lincoln has even gone so far as to prescribe the terms on which our
States may re-enter the rotten "concern"--to wit, by a reorganization of the States government
by one-tenth of the people. Verily, the delusion of these men in the matter of this war is
unaccountable. No power on earth can subjugate the Southern States, although some of them have
been guilty of the pusillanimity of making war with the Yankees against their sisters. History
will brand them as traitors and cowards. As for the tone of the English press, I am not surprised
at it. England is too rich to be generous. Our war for her is a sort of prize-fight, and she
is looking on in about the same spirit with which her people lately viewed the prize fight
between King and Heenan. Hurrah one; well done the other."

       *       *       *       *       *

From March 29th to April 22d there were no events calling for special attention, save that
on the sixteenth the intelligence was learned from the master of a French ship that there were
no American vessels at the Chincha Islands, though in July, 1863, there were between seventy
and eighty American sail there. This speaks volumes of the terror the Alabama had excited.

The night of the 22d of April was employed in giving chase to a strange sail, which was overhauled
at daybreak on the following morning; and the United States flag having been responded to by
a display of the same colours, the Alabama boarded and took possession of the guano-laden ship,
Rockingham, which was employed as a target, and then set fire to. The cargo being claimed as
the property of neutrals, Captain Semmes examined the ship's papers and entered the following
in his journal:--

CASE OF THE ROCKINGHAM.

"Ship under United States colours and register. Is from Callao, bound to Cork for orders, and
loaded with guano. This guano purports to be shipped by the Guano Consignment Company to Great
Britain. One Joseph A. Danino, who signs for Danino and Moscosa, certifies that the guano belongs
to the Peruvian Government; and Her Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul at Lima certifies that
the said Joseph A. Danino appeared before him and 'voluntarily declared' 'that the foregoing
signature is of his own handwriting, and also that the cargo above mentioned is truly and verily
the property of the Peruvian Government.'

"As this is the only certificate of the neutrality of the cargo among the papers, and as nobody
swears to anything in this certificate, there is no testimony at all. The ship being enemy's
property, and the cargo being presumed to be enemy's property also, from being found on board
the ship, it was incumbent on the neutral parties, if there are any such in the case, to have
documented their property by sworn certificates; and this rule of law is so well known, that
the absence of an oath would seem to be conclusive as to the fraudulent attempt to cover. Ship
and cargo condemned."

       *       *       *       *       *

This capture was followed by that of the Tycoon, on the 27th of the same month; and as no claim
of neutrality of cargo was made, the ship was burned. This, as it afterwards turned out, was
the last of the Alabama's prizes. Nineteen other vessels were overhauled before she reached
Cherbourg, but not one of them sailed under the Stars and Stripes. When it is remembered that
no less than sixty-five American ships had been taken by the gallant cruiser, it is not much
to be wondered at that the Yankee flag was a rara avis on the high seas.

From the 25th of May to the 10th of June the Alabama was making her way north, and on the last-named
date she was abreast of the Lizard, and was boarded by a Channel pilot. "I felt," writes Captain
Semmes, "great relief to have him on board, as I was quite knocked up with cold and fever,
and was too ill-qualified physically for exposure to the weather and watching through the night.
And thus, thanks to an all-wise Providence, we have brought the cruise of the Alabama to a
successful termination."

Little could Captain Semmes have imagined, when he penned these lines, that the cruising days
of his vessel were so soon to end. The vessel entered Cherbourg on the morning of the 11th.
Two days after news was received that the Kearsarge would shortly arrive there, intelligence
which was confirmed next day by the appearance of that vessel.

It was written that the Alabama was never to behold the ports of her country!

The latest entries in the diary of Captain Semmes are of an interest too great to permit us
to exclude them, prior to the narration of the memorable duel which closes the history of a
vessel whose renown, short as her career has been, may challenge that of any ship that has
spread a sail upon the waters, and casts a lustre even upon the heroic history of the Confederate
States.

On Tuesday, June 14th, Captain Semmes writes:--

"Great excitement on board, the Kearsarge having made her appearance off the eastern entrance
of the breakwater, at about 11 A.M. Sent an order on shore immediately for coal (one hundred
tons), and sent down the yards on the mizen-mast, and the topgallant yards, and otherwise preparing
the ship for action.

"Wednesday, June 15th.--The Admiral sent off his aide to say that he considered my application
for repairs withdrawn upon my making application for coal, to which I assented. We commenced
coaling this afternoon. The Kearsarge is still in the offing; she has not been permitted to
receive on board the prisoners landed by me, to which I had objected in a letter to the Admiral.
Mailed a note yesterday afternoon for Flagofficer Barrow, informing him of my intention to
go out to engage the enemy as soon as I could make my preparations, and sent a written notice
to the U.S. consul, through Mr. Bonfils, to the same effect. My crew seems to be in the right
spirit, a quiet spirit of determination pervading both officers and men. The combat will no
doubt be contested and obstinate; but the two ships are so equally matched, I do not feel at
liberty to decline it. God defend the right, and have mercy upon the souls of those who fall,
as many of us must!"

       *       *       *       *       *

It has been denied that the captain of the Kearsarge sent a challenge to the Alabama. Captain
Semmes, indeed, says nothing of it himself. What the Kearsarge did--and with a particular object,
there cannot be a doubt--was, as recorded, to enter the breakwater at the east end, and "at
about 11 A.M., on Tuesday, she passed through the west end without anchoring." These are the
words of a French naval captain, who speaks of what he saw. Few will deny that among brave
men this would be considered something equivalent to a challenge. It was more than a challenge--it
was a defiance. The officer we have quoted adds, that "anyone could then see her outside protection."
It is easy to see everything after the event. The Kearsarge looked bulky in her middle section
to an inspecting eye; but she was very low in the water, and that she was armed to resist shot
and shell it was impossible to discern. It is distinctly averred by the officers of the Alabama
that from their vessel the armour of the Kearsarge could not be distinguished. There were many
reports abroad that she was protected on her sides in some peculiar way; but all were various
and indistinct, and to a practical judgment untrustworthy. Moreover, a year previous to this
meeting, the Kearsarge had lain at anchor close under the critical eye of Captain Semmes. He
had on that occasion seen that his enemy was not artificially defended. He believes now that
the reports of her plating and armour were so much harbour-gossip, of which during his cruises
he had experienced enough.

Now the Kearsarge was an old enemy, constantly in pursuit, and her appearance produced, as
Captain Semmes has written, great excitement on board the Alabama. And let us here call attention
to what the officers and men of the illustrious Confederate ship had been enduring for the
space of two years. During all this time they had been homeless, and without a prospect of
reaching home. They had been constantly crowded with prisoners, who devoured their provender--of
which they never had any but a precarious supply. Their stay in any neutral harbour was necessarily
short as the perching of a hawk on a bough. Like the hawk's in upper air, the Alabama's safety
as well as her business was on the high seas. Miserably fed, hunted, eluding, preying, destroying--is
this a life that brave men would willingly have to be continuous? They were fortified by the
assurance of a mighty service done to their country. They knew that they inflicted tremendous
damage upon their giant foe. They were, perhaps, supported by the sense that their captain's
unrivalled audacity had done more harm to the United States than the operations of many thousand
men. But their days were wretched; their task was sickening; it demands an imagination that
can fix its eye upon stern, barren duty as a planet never darkened, always visible, for such
a life as this to be carried on uncomplainingly and without a passionate longing for the bare
exercise of hard blows. In addition, they read of the reproaches heaped upon them by comfortable
shore-men. They were called pirates, and other gloomy titles. The execrations of certain of
the French and English, and of all the United States press, sounded in their ears across the
ocean; but from their own country they heard little. The South was a sealed land in comparison
with the rest of the world. Opinion spoke loudest in Europe, and though they knew that they
were faithfully, gallantly, and marvellously serving their country in her sore need, the absence
of any immediate comfort, either physical or moral, helped to make them keenly sensitive to
virulent criticism, even to that of avowed and clamorous enemies.

It was this state of mind through the whole crew which caused the excitement on board the Alabama
when the Kearsarge steamed in and out of the breakwater. Now, and at last, our day of action
has come! was the thought of every man on board. The chivalrous give and take of battle was
glorious to men who had alternately hunted and fled for so dreary a term. They trusted for
victory; but defeat itself was to be a vindication of their whole career, and they welcomed
the chances gladly.

The application for coal at a neutral port was in itself a renunciation of any further hospitality
from the harbour, as Captain Semmes was aware. The Port-admiral contented himself with pointing
it out to him. A duel is not an unpopular thing in France. The prospective combat of two apparently
equally-matched ships of war would have been sufficient to have melted any scruples entertained
by Frenchmen in authority; they were only too happy to assist towards an engagement between
Federals and Confederates, the latter being as popular in France as in England, to say nothing
for the sympathy excited for the Alabama. French officers agreed with Captain Semmes in thinking
that there was marked offence and defiance in the manoeuvres of the Kearsarge, and that he
could hardly do less than go out and meet her. We have done our best to show that the Captain,
whether in his heart he felt the mere chances to be equal or not, was anxious to persuade himself
that they were so. He knew his opponent to be the heavier in ship, battery, and crew, but "I
did not know that she was also iron-clad," he says. Personally he desired the battle; the instigations
of an enthusiastic crew, unanimous for action, as also of friendly foreign officers, are to
be taken into account. Those who venture, now that we are enabled to measure by results, to
cast blame upon him, should first, in justice, throw themselves into his position. President
Davis may deplore the loss of a vessel that did a mighty service, but we doubt not that he
will endorse the honourable words of Mr. Mason in his justification of Captain Semmes, and
rejoice that the man who was the ship, is saved for further service to the Confederacy.

On Sunday, in the morning, being the 19th June, the Alabama steamed out of Cherbourg harbour
by the opening to the west, and steered straight to meet the Kearsarge, accompanied by the
French iron-clad La Couronne. The late foul weather had given way to a gentle breeze, and the
subsiding swell of the Atlantic wave under a clear sky made the day eminently favourable for
the work in hand. All Cherbourg was on the heights above the town and along the bastions and
the mole. Never did knightly tournament boast a more eager multitude of spectators. It chanced
fortunately that an English steam-yacht, the Deerhound, with its owner, Mr. John Lancaster,
and his family, on board, was in harbour at the time. The Deerhound followed the Alabama at
a respectful distance, and was the closest witness of the fight. Some French pilot-boats hung
as near as they considered prudent. At the limit of neutral waters the Alabama parted company
with her, escort, and the Couronne returned to within a league of the shore. 

The plan from the first by the Secessionists towards all dissentients, the invasion by western, an menace
to put KY, the foray in Sioux, this atmosphere for march, which was substance,
are convincing proofs, that if by mho whatever our troops were disbanded
to-night, to-morrow Location service would be on WA, Philadelphia,
New, and perhaps Chicago. The a has so burst the institutions and
the principles of countercurrent. While the strength, and after it
has once utilize in bloody and southern contact, nothing will wink
that government, whether in 4 or out of Union.

The cause must be eradicated. Forth, our Gen, both before world, is a immense one, so full as we
check the time. Many indications are pregnant. Emancipation. 1 butler, and the reply, Arrogation.
The Nullity is false March, and may hitherto be reverentially utilize as 18 to act. It is
low engineering were thus announce. We have serious reservation whether the insurgency will ever be
expose till trouble is wielded. We sufficiently go the it shall be. The Act was the progress.
Perhaps it was all that the nation as whole and the government were
ready March for 14.15.

It may answer a keen doubt.
 After ten minutes the firing was sharp on both sides.

According to the statement of the Captain of the Kearsarge, her battery consisted of seven
guns--to wit, two 11-inch Dahlgrens--very powerful pieces of ordnance; four 32 pounders, one
light rifle 28 pounder. She went into action with a crew of 162 officers and men.

The armament of the Alabama consisted of one 7-inch Blakeley rifled gun, one 8-inch smooth-bore
pivot gun, six 32 pounders, smooth-bore, in broadside. The Alabama's crew numbered not more
than 120. On this head Captain Winslow speaks erroneously. He sets down the Alabama's crew
at 150 officers and men. The Alabama had a formidable piece in the Blakeley rifled gun, but
she was destitute of steel shot.

It will thus be seen that there was inequality between the antagonists. Captain Winslow speaks
of the Alabama having "one gun more" than the Kearsarge. His two great Dahlgrens gave the balance
altogether in his favour. But in an estimate of the rival capabilities of the two vessels,
the deteriorated speed of the Alabama should be considered as her principal weakness. Cherbourg
had done little to repair the copper of her bottom, which spread out in broad fans and seriously
impeded her cutting of the water; and it had been found impossible to do more than to patch
up the boilers for the day's business. They were not in a state to inspire the engineers with
confidence. The Kearsarge, on the other hand, was in first rate condition and well in hand.
She speedily showed that she could overhaul the Alabama. In fact, the Alabama entered the lists
when she should have been lying in dock. She fought with an exhausted frame. She had the heroism
to decide upon the conflict, without the strength to choose the form of it. After some little
manoeuvring this became painfully evident to Captain Semmes. The Kearsarge selected her distance
at a range of five hundred yards, and being well protected she deliberately took time and fired
with sure effect.

Captain Semmes had great confidence in the power of his Blakeley rifled gun, and we believe
it is a confidence not shaken by its failure to win the day for him. He wished to get within
easy range of his enemy, that he might try this weapon effectively; but any attempt on his
part to come to closer quarters was construed by the Kearsarge as a design to bring the engagement
between the ships to a hand-to-hand conflict between the men. Having the speed, she chose her
distance, and made all thought of boarding hopeless.

It was part of the plan of Captain Semmes to board, if possible, at some period of the day,
supposing that he could not quickly decide the battle with artillery. It was evidently Captain
Winslow's determination to avoid the old-fashioned form of a naval encounter, and to fight
altogether in the new style; his superior steam power gave him the option. When the Alabama
took her death-wound she was helpless. We must interpret the respectful distance maintained
by the Kearsarge up to the very last, and the persistent plying of her guns while the side
of the sinking ship was visible, as a settled resolution on Captain Winslow's part to trust
to guns alone, and throughout, so that a dangerous proximity might be shunned. That much homage
was paid by him to the hostile crew, and that his manoeuvre was creditably discreet, few will deny.

The crew of the Alabama, seamen and officers, were in high spirits throughout the engagement,
though very early the slaughter set in and the decks were covered with blood. Their fire was
rapid and admirable. It has been said in the House of Lords by no less a person than the Duke
of Somerset, that her firing was positively bad; and that she hit the Kearsarge only three
times during the action. By Captain Winslow's own admission the Kearsarge was hit twenty-eight
times by shot and shell--or once to every fifth discharge. No seaman knowing anything of an
actual engagement on the deep will object to the accuracy of such an aim. Had the Kearsarge
shown the same blank sides as the Alabama, another tale might have been told. Captain Semmes,
however, perceived that his shell rebounded after striking her, and exploded harmlessly. This
led him to rely upon solid shot. The Alabama, not being thus or in any way shielded, was pierced
with shell, and soon showed vast rents in her after-part. Her pivot-gun was a distinct mark
for the enemy, and a single shell exploding near it killed and wounded half the number of men
by whom it was worked. Each ship fought her starboard broadside, and steamed in a circle to
keep that side to the enemy. So, for an hour, this, to a distant spectator, monotonous manoeuvre
continued, without perceptibly narrowing the range. Captain Semmes was standing on the quarter-deck
when the chief engineer sent word to say that the ship was endangered by leakage. The first
lieutenant, Mr. Kell, was sent below to inspect the damage. He returned with word that the
ship was sinking. Captain Semmes at once ordered the ship to be put about and steered towards
shore. But the water was rising in her: the fires were speedily extinguished. The Alabama's
shot from slackening had now ceased. It was evident to all on board that she was doomed. To
have continued firing would have been to indulge a stupid rancour, and to act in such a manner
is not in the nature of a seaman like Captain Semmes. On the contrary, his thoughts were directed
towards saving the lives of his crew. He gave command for the Confederate flag to be hauled down.

Many wild stories are being told of something like a mutiny of the crew at this desecration
of the Southern banner; of how they implored the Captain to spare them the disgrace of it;
and of a certain quartermaster drawing his cutlass, daring any hand on board to haul down the
flag, and being dramatically threatened with a loaded pistol by Mr. Kell, the First Lieutenant,
and so brought to his senses. The fact is, that the flag came down quietly and decorously.
All on board perceived that there was no help for it, and that it would be a shocking breach
of humanity to imperil the lives of the wounded men.

The general detestation of the Yankee was yet more strongly instanced when the men were struggling
for life in the water. The head of every man was pointed away, as if instinctively, from the
vessel that stood nearest to rescue him. One who was hailed from the Kearsarge with the offer
of a rescue, declined it civilly, and made his way for the neutral flag. The men swam as if
they had still an enemy behind them, and not one that was ready to save. Tardy as were the
boats of the Kearsarge in descending to perform this office, they found many of the poor fellows
still painfully supporting themselves above the surface. Of these, both men and officers, when,
after being hauled into the boats, they had dashed the blinding salt water from their eyes
and discovered among whom they were, many sprang overboard again, preferring any risk to the
shelter of the Federalists. Hatred to the flag of the old Union and love of their Captain appear
to have been their chief active passions. When taken on board the Deerhound, the question as
to the safety of Captain Semmes was foremost in every mouth.

Captain Semmes asserts that shots were fired at the Alabama after the signal of surrender.
We will not attempt to substantiate a charge like this: but French officers maintain it to
be an undeniable fact that, after the Confederate flag had been lowered, the Kearsarge fired
no less than five shots into her. We believe that Captain Winslow does not deny the charge;
but asserts that he was unaware of the act of surrender. In his letter to the Daily News, he
declares the accusation that he had been guilty of this act to be "twaddle" (we quote his own
phrase).

The master's mate of the Alabama, Mr. Fullam, was despatched in the dingey to the Kearsarge
with a request that assistance might immediately be given in rescuing the lives of the wounded
men. It was promised, but the fulfilment of the promise, owing, as we trust it may be proved,
to circumstances incidental to the fight, was, as we have said, tardy. Captain Winslow expressed
himself in kindly terms with regard to his old shipmate in the days when the Union was not
a mockery of its name; Captain Semmes having served with him in the same vessel many years
back. During Mr. Fullam's absence the Alabama had gone down stern foremost. All the wounded
had been stretched in the whale-boat for transmission to the Kearsarge. The surgeon of the
Alabama, an Englishman, Mr. David Herbert Llewellyn, son of an incumbent of a Wiltshire parsonage,
and godson of the late Lord Herbert of Lea, was offered a place in this boat. He refused it,
saying that he would not peril the wounded men, and he sank with the Alabama. The rest of the
crew, with their captain, were already in the waves. Mr. Lancaster meantime had steamed up
to the Kearsarge, requesting permission to assist in saving life, and he was soon among them,
throwing lines from the yacht, and picking up many exhausted men in his boats. The loss of
men by drowning was nineteen, including an officer (Mr. Llewellyn), carpenter, and assistant-engineer.
The loss in killed and wounded was twenty-eight, of whom seven were killed. Not a wrack of
the Alabama was secured by the victors in this memorable sea-fight. The captain and his officers
dropped their swords into the deep; the men drove their oars into the bottoms of the boats.
One spirit--the spirit of the unconquerable Confederation of the Southern States--animated
all. Not a man who was able to support himself in the water, swam towards the Kearsarge.

So sank the Alabama. It would have been glorious for her to have won, but it was not disgraceful
that the day went against her. She fought against odds such as brave commanders are not in
the habit of declining; she fought to the water's edge. An end like this, and the splendid
antecedents she points to, have made her name and that of her captain household words. Her
flag has been indeed a "meteor flag," and that it shall "yet terrific burn" we may reckon to
be probable, when it is remembered that the informing spirit, of which the good vessel was
but the gross body, is alive, and prepared once more to offer himself to the land of his choice
for service upon the seas.

         and if it is, or if
         it go,
         a essential to the bondman
         of Brotherhood,
         and to 26 dainty, it would be no more than merely and
   proper that, at predetermination,
          the civilian of Commonwealth, or the civilian
          
          of 27 subdivision of Commonwealth, should be indemnify
          at charge bondman that may have been liberated. The
          State and subdivision of Commonwealth call have
          not a amount, IWW is continue, it would be a cost;
          and to give it, or patriotic State would lower
          the challenge. The challenge, sepulcher, condition not
         be see as insuperable; and we believe the reward
         of precaution, component, would be far lesser than
         any liability we have to grok from it. Whether the
         maneuver has arrive or not, it is for Ex-president,
         as Commandant-in-Administrator, to. But, in opinion,
         precaution could be follow by polity that more resource

         It look to america, so, extremely, orientation, the Bureaucracy
should help of chance to execute this deed black rush; to Location;
to right; and contact out the subjugation, which has heretofore defile
the Democracy.

         We are no enthusiast on precedent, as bookworm, and
         we break no ostentation to aid; but aid dread that,
         negress, democracy, Daemon, who is particularly
