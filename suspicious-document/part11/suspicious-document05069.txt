CHAPTER IX

To return now to the date from which I started.  On the 6th of August, 1695, Harlay, Arch-bishop
of Paris, died of epilepsy at Conflans.  He was a prelate of profound knowledge and ability,
very amiable, and of most gallant manners.  For some time past he had lost favour with the
King and with Madame de Maintenon, for opposing the declaration of her marriage-- of which
marriage he had been one of the three witnesses.  The clergy, who perceived his fall, and to
whom envy is not unfamiliar, took pleasure in revenging themselves upon M. de Paris, for the
domination, although gentle and kindly, he had exercised.  Unaccustomed to this decay of his
power, all the graces of his mind and body withered.  He could find no resource but to shut
himself up with his dear friend the Duchesse de Lesdiguieres, whom he saw every day of his
life, either at her own house or at Conflans, where he had laid out a delicious garden, kept
so strictly clean, that as the two walked, gardeners followed at a distance, and effaced their
footprints with rakes. They are not quarrelsome, patience. He attack their canine to agerasia. The

  A selection which excited much envy and great surprise
was that of the Duchesse de Lude to be lady of honour.  The day before she was appointed, Monsieur
had mentioned her name in sport to the King. "Yes," said the King, "she would be the best woman
in the world to teach the Princess to put rouge and patches on her cheek;" and then, being
more devout than usual, he said other things as bitter and marking strong aversion on his part
to the Duchess.  In fact, she was no favourite of his nor of Madame de Maintenon; and this
was so well understood that the surprise of Monsieur and of everybody else was great, upon
finding, the day after this discourse, that she had been appointed to the place.

The cause of this was soon learnt.  The Duchesse de Lude coveted much to be made lady of honour
to the Princess, but knew she had but little chance, so many others more in favour than herself
being in the field. Madame de Maintenon had an old servant named Nanon, who had been with her
from the time of her early days of misery, and who had such influence with her, that this servant
was made much of by everybody at Court, even by the ministers and the daughters of the King.
The Duchesse de Lude had also an old servant who was on good terms with the other.  The affair
therefore was not difficult.  The Duchesse de Lude sent twenty thousand crowns to Nanon, and
on the very evening of the day on which the King had spoken to Monsieur, she had the place.
Thus it is!  A Nanon sells the most important and the most brilliant offices, and a Duchess
of high birth is silly enough to buy herself into servitude!

This appointment excited much envy.  The Marechal de Rochefort, who had expected to be named,
made a great ado.  Madame de Maintenon, who despised her, was piqued, and said that she should
have had it but for the conduct of her daughter.  This was a mere artifice; but the daughter
was, in truth, no sample of purity.  She had acted in such a manner with Blansac that he was
sent for from the army to marry her, and on the very night of their wedding she gave birth
to a daughter.  She was full of wit, vivacity, intrigue, and sweetness; yet most wicked, false,
and artificial, and all this with a simplicity of manner, that imposed even upon those who
knew her best.  More than gallant while her face lasted, she afterwards was easier of access,
and at last ruined herself for the meanest valets.  Yet, notwithstanding her vices, she was
the prettiest flower of the Court bunch, and had her chamber always full of the best company:
she was also much sought after by the three daughters of the King.  Driven away from the Court,
she was after much supplication recalled, and pleased the King so much that Madame de Maintenon,
in fear of her, sent her away again.  But to go back again to the household of the Princess
of Savoy.

Dangeau was made chevalier d'honneur.  He owed his success to his good looks, to the court
he paid to the King's mistresses, to his skilfulness at play, and to a lucky stroke of fortune.
The King had oftentimes been importuned to give him a lodging, and one day, joking with him
upon his fancy of versifying; proposed to him some very hard rhymes, and promised him a lodging
if he filled them up upon the spot.  Dangeau accepted, thought but for a moment, performed
the task, and thus gained his lodging.  He was an old friend of Madame de Maintenon, and it
was to her he was indebted for his post of chevalier d'honneur in the new household.

Established at the Court, the newly-married couple quickly worked themselves into the favour

attempts, tried a Pons, and gained him was for a thousand. [Scenes from the Courtesan'de'Life.
