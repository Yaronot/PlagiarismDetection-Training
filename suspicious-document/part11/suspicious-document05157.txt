A BOY'S VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD

EDITED BY SAMUEL SMILES, LL.D.

AUTHOR OF 'SELF-HELP,' ETC.

LONDON JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET

1905

PREFACE.

I have had pleasure in editing this little book, not only because it is the work of my youngest
son, but also because it contains the results of a good deal of experience of life under novel
aspects, as seen by young, fresh, and observant eyes.

How the book came to be written is as follows: The boy, whose two years' narrative forms the
subject of these pages, was at the age of sixteen seized with inflammation of the lungs, from
which he was recovering so slowly and unsatisfactorily, that I was advised by London physicians
to take him from the business he was then learning in Yorkshire, and send him on a long sea
voyage. Australia was recommended, because of the considerable time occupied in making the
voyage by sailing ship, and also because of the comparatively genial and uniform temperature
while at sea.

He was accordingly sent out to Melbourne by one of Money Wigram's ships in the winter of 1868-9,
with directions either to return by the same ship or, if the opportunity presented itself,
to remain for a time in the colony. It will be found, from his own narrative that, having obtained
some suitable employment, he decided to adopt the latter course; and for a period of about
eighteen months he resided at Majorca, an up-country township situated in the gold-mining district
of Victoria.

When his health had become re-established, he was directed to return home, about the beginning
of the present year; and he resolved to make the return voyage by the Pacific route, viâ Honolulu
and San Francisco, and to proceed from thence by railway across the Rocky Mountains to New York.

While at sea, the boy kept a full log, intended for the perusal of his relatives at home; and
while on land, he corresponded with them regularly and fully, never missing a mail. He had
not the remotest idea that anything which he saw and described during his absence would ever
appear in a book. But since his return, it has occurred to the Editor of these pages that the
information they contain will probably be found interesting to a wider circle of readers than
that to which the letters were originally addressed; and in that belief, the substance of them
is here reproduced, the Editor's work having consisted mainly in arranging the materials, leaving
the writer to tell his own story as much as possible in his own way, and in his own words.

ROUND THE WORLD.

CHAPTER I.

DOWN CHANNEL.

20th February: At Gravesend.--My last farewells are over, my last adieus are waved to friends
on shore, and I am alone on board the ship 'Yorkshire,' bound for Melbourne. Everything is
in confusion on board. The decks are littered with stores, vegetables, hen-coops, sheep-pens,
and coils of rope. There is quite a little crowd of sailors round the capstan in front of the
cabin door. Two officers, with lists before them, are calling over the names of men engaged
to make up our complement of hands, and appointing them to their different watches.

Though the ship is advertised to sail this evening, the stores are by no means complete. The
steward is getting in lots of cases; and what a quantity of pickles! Hens are coming up to
fill the hen-coops. More sheep are being brought; there are many on board already; and here
comes our milk-cow over the ship's side, gently hoisted up by a rope. The animal seems amazed;
but she is in skilful hands. "Let go!" calls out the boatswain, as the cow swings in mid-air;
away rattles the chain round the wheel of the donkey-engine, and the break is put on just in
time to land Molly gently on the deck. In a minute she is snug in her stall "for'ard," just
by the cook's galley.

Passengers are coming on board. Here is one mounting the ship's side, who has had a wet passage
from the shore. A seaman lends him a hand, and he reaches the sloppy, slippery deck with difficulty.
