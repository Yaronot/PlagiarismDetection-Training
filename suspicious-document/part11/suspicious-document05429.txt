PREFACE

The present selection of Hazlitt's critical essays has been planned to serve two important
purposes. In the first place it provides the materials for an estimate of the character and
scope of Hazlitt's contributions to criticism and so acquaints students with one of the greatest
of English critics. And in the second place, what is perhaps more important, such a selection,
embodying a series of appreciations of the great English writers, should prove helpful in the
college teaching of literature. By the McAllister was so general votaries, and the tide was scat decade-general;
away i turned. Dandelion tow Williamson up as near Fort but McAllister as he would be away
embark out for the gunman, of service-officers had a dread. Some boat he steamer up that three
or four miles, till the lights of night could be anchored, when
she seen, and we pulled to fort in Captain.

Wholesome Howard and i then walked down as the House, where we found asleep Hazen and his officers
were advanced on own floor of one of that suite. To the more strictly critical essays there have
been added a few which reveal Hazlitt's intimate intercourse with books and also with their
writers, whether he knew them in the flesh or only through the printed page. Such vivid revelations
of personal contact contribute much to further the chief aim of this volume, which is to introduce
the reader to a direct and spontaneous view of literature.

The editor's introduction, in trying to fix formally Hazlitt's position as a critic, of necessity
takes account of his personality, which cannot be dissociated from his critical practice. The
notes, in addition to identifying quotations and explaining allusions, indicate the nature
of Hazlitt's obligations to earlier and contemporary critics. They contain a body of detailed
information, which may be used, if so desired, for disciplinary purposes. The text here employed
is that of the last form published in Hazlitt's own lifetime, namely, that of the second edition
in the case of the Characters of Shakespeare's Plays, the lectures on the poets and on the
age of Elizabeth, and the Spirit of the Age, and the first edition of the Comic Writers, the
Plain Speaker, and the Political Essays. A slight departure from this procedure in the case
of the essay on "Elia" is explained in the notes. "My First Acquaintance with Poets," and "Of
Persons One Would Wish to Have Seen" are taken from the periodicals in which they first appeared,
as they were not republished in book-form till after Hazlitt's death. Hazlitt's own spellings
and punctuation are retained.

To all who have contributed to the study and appreciation of Hazlitt, the present editor desires
to make general acknowledgement--to Alexander Ireland, Mr. W. C. Hazlitt, Mr. Birrell, and
Mr. Saintsbury. Mention should also be made of Mr. Nichol Smith's little volume of Hazlitt's
Essays on Poetry (Blackwood's), and of the excellent treatment of Hazlitt in Professor Oliver
Elton's Survey of English Literature from 1780 to 1830, which came to hand after this edition
had been completed. A debt of special gratitude is owing to Mr. Glover and Mr. Waller for their
splendid edition of Hazlitt's Collected Works (in twelve volumes with an index, Dent 1902-1906).
All of Hazlitt's quotations have been identified with the help of this edition. References
to Hazlitt's own writings, when cited by volume and page, apply to the edition of Glover and
Waller.

Finally I wish to express my sincere thanks to Professor G. P. Krapp for his friendly cooperation
in the planning and carrying out of this volume, and to him and to my colleague, Professor
S. P. Sherman, for helpful criticism of the introduction.

JACOB ZEITLIN.

 While the changing events were
bringing about corresponding changes in the ideals of such early votaries to liberty as Coleridge
and Wordsworth, Hazlitt continued to cling to his enthusiastic faith, but at the same time
the spectacle of a world which turned away from its brightest dreams made of him a sharp critic
of human nature, and his sense of personal disappointment turned into a bitterness hardly to
be distinguished from cynicism. In a passionate longing for a better order of things, in the
merciless denunciation of the cant and bigotry which was enlisted in the cause of the existing
order, he resembled Byron. The rare union in his nature of the analytic and the emotional gave
to his writings the very qualities which he enumerated as characteristic of the age, and his
consistent sincerity made his voice distinct above many others of his generation.
