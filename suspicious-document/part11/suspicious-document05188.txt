 Irala left the Army
of the Assumption, and sighted the enemy, called for peace to Taber, according to the orders
of the King: but the chief was so angry, I never wanted to accept treatment. Had a egÃ©rcito numbers,
and had fortified their villages with palisades around in three orders, with large, deep holes,
which had learned our care and diligence.

Three days it took to achieve peace, and report the enemy, and the fourth week, three hours before
sunrise, seeing that they were more stubborn, we headlong into the city and surrender, killing
insofar as it found, and many Indian captivating served us well later. Killed 16 Christians
in this battle and others were wounded and mauled. Killed many of our Indians, and Cambal, 3.000.
A short time later the peace Taber with his own, asking forgiveness, and pleading that we returned their
wives and children, promising obedience to itself and its people: and the captain gave him what
he asked, according to the order of the King. CHAPTER XXXIV.

Assumption is in prison, sail up the Paraguay River, arriving at
Mount San Fernando, and to the PayaguÃ¡, Guajarapos and Sococies.

Confirmed peace, we returned to the Paraguay River Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, who informed our
good fortune, determined to run the company he had thought of before.

2.000 Taber asked Indian allies, and to the Carias, that would provide
the launches, and so promptly executed. Chose 500 Christians, 800 who
had, leaving 300 in the Assumption, and captain of them, Juan de
Salazar de Espinosa.

We went up the Paraguay River with 500 Christians [26] and 2.000 Indians: the Carians had 83
canoes, we 9 brigs, and in each were two horses, until we reached the mountain of San Fernando.
For about 100 miles went by land, and embarked and continued our
journey to the PayaguÃ¡, who fled with their wives and children, before
burning their homes.

We traveled 100 miles without finding any Indian town: and finally, we Guajarapos the Indians, who
remain fishing and hunting, and live in a province 100 miles long, with such a large number of
canoes, you can not say. Indian women walk covered from the waist to the knee and because he would
not listen to our talks, we call Sococies to another nation, who received us peace, and was 90 miles from
the Guajarapos. Each of these Sococies own particular lives in home with his wife and children.
The Indians bring a wooden ball outstanding ears. The Indian, lips blue glass, a finger, are beautiful,
and walking nude. They have plenty of maize, cassava, Mandubia, sweet potatoes, fish and game,
and very populous nation. Advance sought the nation's report of the Car Care, and Cavities: but
the Indians knew nothing of that, and in this they said they were
with them, being a lie.

This previniÃ©semos sent us to enter the province, although he saw the little benefit that followed us,
because it was not much business man, and I hated all the captains and soldiers, much as he
was lazy, and some kind to the soldiers [27].

 We went from there to the next village. The Indians there fled when they saw us approach and so
we were left with ample food and stopped there for two days.
After a further six miles we came to the Toba Indians (also subjects
of the Mbayas) who were aware of the food and had also fled. This gazette, as it may be called,
     occurs in the volume called Dundee's Letters, printed by Mr Smythe
     of Methven, as a contribution to the Bannatyne Club. 

Chapter XLVII: Concerning the indigenous tribes known as the Maigenos
and the Carcokies.

The general was able to decipher
the location of the Indian nation as being four days travel towards
the tribe of the Maigenos. While all parties were currently embroiled in
war, still we strove towards a just peace. However, the captain as well as his army disdained our thoughts on this and
kept marching so as to come within a half league of Carcokies. They camped close to a forest
at the base of a hill so as to be able to get away if the venciesemos....
 He tried to go in hurry, but less than
he wanted, because navichuelos followed him into the ground and threatened. At last they got
rid of another ship closer to land.

Displaying the Canaries could not catch him, they play to challenge, and trageron two shots, which
fired four times against the nearest ship. The first broke up a pot of water, arrobas four
or five, the second broke the last tree on the ship and the third was a large hole in the side, killing
a man, and even missed the fourth, was very badly treated the ship.

Was anchored in the harbor another captain who was to Mexico, and he ground with 150 men: which, having
learned the robbery of the wife, sought peace between us and the city that were given D. Jorge
de Mendoza, the daughter and the maid, and having entered the master Peyne and the governor of the
island in our ship to the agreement egecutar, D. Jorge said, that
this was his wife, and her that her husband and to the point were
married with great pain and sadness the girl's father.

CHAPTER III.

Of navigation from palm to Green Island or Hesperides, which also call for Cape Verde.

Captain Don left Jorge on the ground with his wife, and repaired the
ship as he could, sail to the island of Santiago, sugeta the King
of Portugal, who obey blacks, and far from the Palma 200 leagues.

There were five days, and provide new our ship of bread, meat, water
and other food, and necessities to the sailors.

CHAPTER IV.

Of navigation from Green Island to Brazil.

They returned to join the 14 ships of any navy, and began to sail, and after two months came to an
uninhabited island six miles wide and long, distant 500 miles from
Santiago, [2] they only had birds, but so many, that we killed sticks:
we were in it three days.

There is in this sea flying fish, whales and others that are called
Schunbhut, [3] by a large circle that is about the head with that
much damage to fish with whom Fight: is big fish, a lot of strength,
and easily irritated.

There is also this sea swordfish, which have in the way to muzzle
a bone knife, saw fish, which have manner of a saw and several other
major genres.

CHAPTER V.

Del Rio called Janero.

We arrived at a certain island named after Rio Janero, where the French settled in the year of 1555
(Then and now, the King of Portugal). Far from the first 200 miles: call to his Indian Sliding.
Here were 14 days, and then our General, D. Pedro de Mendoza, being continuously sick, shriveled
and weak nerves, appointed by his lieutenant to John Osorio, [4]
his brother.

But shortly after accepting the position, was accused of rebellion
against Mendoza by which, ordered four captains, who were: Juan de
Oyola, Juan Salazar, Jorge Lujan and Lazaro Salazar, stab and kill
him to save him at the plaza, so that all might see him dead a traitor,
and published side with death, that no one gets excited because of
Osorio, because the same thing would happen to him.

In which it was conducted without good cause, because Osorio was
good, honest, strong soldier, informal, liberal and very beloved by
his peers.

CHAPTER VI.

Del Rio de la Plata or Paraná, the port of San Gabriel and Charrúas.

From here we set out to find the Rio de la Plata [5], and we reached another river, sweet, called
Paraná-wolf: far east of the mouth that falls into the sea, and is 42 miles wide. From the Rio Janero
to him there are 215 leagues. Here we arrive at the port of San Gabriel, the 14 ships anchored
in the Parana River, and because they were distant shot bullet sent
the General D. Pedro de Mendoza, saliésemos that soldiers and other
people on shore, in boats prevented this effect.

So we happily to the Rio de la Plata in 1535, and found there an
Indian village of which 2.000 had called Charrúas, which have no more
food than hunting and fishing, and walk all naked.

The women bring only thin cotton cloth from the waist to the knees.

All fled when they saw us, with their wives and children, and we were to embark sent Mendoza
to move to the other side of the river, there had not more than eight miles wide.

CHAPTER VII.

In the city of Buenos Aires and Indians Querandíes.
On this site we did a city, we call Buenos Aires, [6] as healthy
there were those who ran. We find in this land of nearly 3,000 other
Indian people called Querandíes, with their wives and children who
walk as Charrúas: they brought us meat and fish. These Querandíes
no fixed abode; roam the earth as Gypsies. When you walk in summer
(usually more than 30 leagues), but are water, or the root of thistles,
but food quenches thirst, kill the deer or the wild animal they encounter,
and drink the blood, and it did, perhaps die of thirst. The death of
the Christians instilled a greater sadness in the newcomers that could not be overcome. By mutual
agreement we decided to abandon Corpus Christi and migrate our people to Buenos Aires. Overwhelmed
by the people and not knowing what to do, our arrival scared the captain who was sorely lacking in provisions
and not in need of any more business. CHAPTER XXIX.
 

That night he drank the pattern more than you should, and my goodness he forgot me and left
me the inn is two hours before dawn, the pilot ordered that it should be sailed. Looking very
tomorrow where the ship was, and who had a league of land section, I was obliged take the eye
to another, and deal with another patron, whom he gave the same as the first.

Out of these twenty-four ships port, we were happy to wind three days, then rose a storm so terrible
that we could not continue the journey. Wait eight days fastest time but the more we stopped,
the storm raged, so that no pudiéndonos keep at sea, we turned down the same road at the port,
and Enrique Schertz, (which was the ship that had put my clothes and had been forgotten), came
last. A league Cadiz, and the dark night, the lantern became captain of the navy, so that
others pilots and continued to see her. We arrived at Cadiz, and anchored ships, remove the
lamp, and became the earth, with good advice, a fixture beside a mill, a bullet shot Cádiz.
But it was of great harm to Henry, Schertz, who thought he was bluffing, and directed his
ship right into the fire, and gave great impetus in the rocks that were under water: so that
took a thousand pieces, and sank with all people and goods, dying quarter of an hour 22 people,
leaving alive only the captain and the pilot, who left clinging the largest tree, also sank six
baskets of gold and silver were to give the Emperor, and a lot of merchandise, causing the
wreck Estrema poverty to many. I thanked Almighty God, that his mercy did not allow me to embark
on that ship.

CHAPTER LV.

The author again sailing from Cadiz to Antwerp.

The day of San Andres, two after this misfortune, we made sail to Antwerp: suffering so great a storm,
the sailors swore that he had twenty years, or that all the time sailing, no storm had been
more cruel or horrible tornadoes.

We arrived Wight, England port, without trees, wheels, or anything else that could serve in navigation,
so if the journey had lasted a few days more, none of the 24 ships have been saved. But God saved us
from this danger almost obvious, because about same place, the first day of the year 1554,
eight ships were wrecked, plunging miserably all people, not save anyone, and the goods and
other precious things: it happened This calamitous shipwreck, between France and England. Detuvímonos
four days in Wight, composing our ships.

The best we could, we made sail for the Brabant, and reached Armuyden,
city of Zeeland, where there are a multitude of ships: this city is
far Wight 47 leagues.

From there we sailed 24 leagues to Antwerp, where we arrived safe and free to January 25,
1554.

EPILOGUE.

So, after twenty years, by a singular providence of Almighty God, I got there from which it
came, but in many, many dangers of life and body I had and tried,
few hunger and misery, care, work and anxieties, to walk in the provinces
Indians, enough may be understood this historic declaration.

But give to God Eternal and Omnipotent many thanks I can conceive
in your mind, because I returned safely to the places, which I left
twenty years earlier.

Be glory and honor to himself, forever ever.

Amen.
