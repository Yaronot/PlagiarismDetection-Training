THE HISTORY OF "PUNCH"

PREFACE.

The prevailing idea of the origin and history of Punch has hitherto rested mainly on three
productions: the "Memories" of George Hodder, "Mr. Punch's Origin and Career," and Mr. Joseph
Hatton's delightful but fragmentary papers, entitled "The True Story of Punch." So far as the
last-named is based upon the others, it is untrustworthy in its details; but the statements
founded on the writer's own knowledge and on the documentary matter in his hands, as well as
upon his intimacy with Mark Lemon, possess a distinct and individual value, and I have not
failed to avail myself in the following pages of Mr. Hatton's courteous permission to make
such use of them as might be desirable.

During the four years in which I have been engaged upon this book, my correspondents have been
numbered by hundreds. Hardly a man living whom I suspected of having worked for Punch, but
I have communicated with him; scarce one but has afforded all the information within his knowledge
in response to my application. Editor and members of the Punch Staff, past and present--"outsiders,"
equally with those belonging to "the Table"--the relations and friends of such as are dead,
all have given their help, and have shown an interest in the work which I hope the result may
be thought to justify. All this mass of material--all the evidence, published and unpublished,
that was adduced in order to establish certain points and refute others--had to be carefully
sifted and collated, contrary testimony weighed, and the truth determined. Especially was this
the case in dealing with the valuable reminiscences imparted by Punch's earliest collaborators,
still or till lately living. Of undoubted contributors and their work, it may be stated, more
than two hundred and fifty are here dealt with. A further number cheerfully submitted to cross-examination
on one or other of the many subjects touched upon; and probably as many more were approached
with only negative results.

My special thanks are due to Mrs. Chaplin, the daughter of the late Mr. Ebenezer Landells,
who unreservedly placed in my hands all the Punch documents, legal and otherwise, accounts,
and letters, concerning the origin and early editorships of Punch, which have been preserved
in the family; and to Messrs. Bradbury and Agnew, who have supplemented these with similar
assistance, as well as with books of the Firm establishing points of literary interest not
hitherto suspected, together with the letters of Thackeray which illustrate his early connection
with and final secession from the Staff. Apart from their general interest, these documents,
taken together, establish the facts of such very vexed questions as the origin and the early
editorships of Punch. This is the more satisfactory, perhaps, by reason of the numerous unfounded
claims--or founded chiefly on family tradition or filial pride and affection--which are still
being made on behalf of supposed originators of the Paper. Even these partisan historians,
it is believed, will hardly be able to resist the proofs here set forth; although attested
fact does not, with them, necessarily carry conviction. For such services, and for their ready
and sympathetic acquiescence in the requests I have made for permission to quote text or reproduce
engraving, my hearty thanks to Messrs. Bradbury, Agnew and Co. are due. To them and to all
my numerous correspondents I here repeat the assurance of gratitude for their courtesy which
I have privately expressed before.

I have reproduced no more pictures from Punch than were rendered necessary by the topics under
discussion. I would rather send the reader, for Punch's pictures, to the ever-fresh pages of
Punch itself. Nor, I may add, did I seek information and assistance from its Proprietors until
this book was well advanced, preferring to make independent research and to test statements
on my own account.

My primary inducement to the writing of this book has been the interest surrounding Punch,
the study of which has not begotten in me the hero-worship that can see no fault. How far I
have succeeded, it rests with the readers of this volume to decide.
