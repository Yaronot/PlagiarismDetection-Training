ONE -- The Absence of Mr Glass

THE consulting-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, the eminent criminologist and specialist in certain
moral disorders, lay along the sea-front at Scarborough, in a series of very large and well-lighted
french windows, which showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marble.
In such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue-green dado: for the chambers
themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness not unlike the terrible tidiness of
the sea. It must not be supposed that Dr Hood's apartments excluded luxury, or even poetry.
These things were there, in their place; but one felt that they were never allowed out of their
place. Luxury was there: there stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars;
but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the wall and the
mildest nearest the window. A tantalus containing three kinds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence,
stood always on this table of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky, brandy,
and rum seemed always to stand at the same level. Poetry was there: the left-hand corner of
the room was lined with as complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show
of English and foreign physiologists. But if one took a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that
rank, its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man's front teeth. One could not say the
books were never read; probably they were, but there was a sense of their being chained to
their places, like the Bibles in the old churches. Dr Hood treated his private book-shelf as
if it were a public library. And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves
laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco, it goes without
saying that yet more of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the specialist's
library, and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike instruments of chemistry
or mechanics.

Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments, bounded--as the boys' geographies say--on
the east by the North Sea and on the west by the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist
library. He was clad in an artist's velvet, but with none of an artist's negligence; his hair
was heavily shot with grey, but growing thick and healthy; his face was lean, but sanguine
and expectant. Everything about him and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless,
like that great northern sea by which (on pure principles of hygiene) he had built his home.

Fate, being in a funny mood, pushed the door open and introduced into those long, strict, sea-flanked
apartments one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master. In answer
to a curt but civil summons, the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room a shapeless
little figure, which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as a mass of luggage.
The umbrella was a black and prosaic bundle long past repair; the hat was a broad-curved black
hat, clerical but not common in England; the man was the very embodiment of all that is homely
and helpless.

The doctor regarded the new-comer with a restrained astonishment, not unlike that he would
have shown if some huge but obviously harmless sea-beast had crawled into his room. The new-comer
regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterizes a corpulent
charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an omnibus. It is a rich confusion of
social self-congratulation and bodily disarray. His hat tumbled to the carpet, his heavy umbrella
slipped between his knees with a thud; he reached after the one and ducked after the other,
but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows:

"My name is Brown. Pray excuse me. I've come about that business of the MacNabs. I have heard,
you often help people out of such troubles. Pray excuse me if I am wrong."

By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat, and made an odd little bobbing bow over
it, as if setting everything quite right.

"I hardly understand you," replied the scientist, with a cold intensity of manner. "I fear
you have mistaken the chambers. I am Dr Hood, and my work is almost entirely literary and educational.
It is true that I have sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty
and importance, but--"

"Oh, this is of the greatest importance," broke in the little man called Brown. "Why, her mother
won't let them get engaged." And he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality.

The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly, but the eyes under them were bright with something
that might be anger or might be amusement. "And still," he said, "I do not quite understand."

"You see, they want to get married," said the man with the clerical hat. "Maggie MacNab and
young Todhunter want to get married. Now, what can be more important than that?"

The great Orion Hood's scientific triumphs had deprived him of many things--some said of his
health, others of his God; but they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd.
At the last plea of the ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him from inside, and he threw
himself into an arm-chair in an ironical attitude of the consulting physician.

"Mr Brown," he said gravely, "it is quite fourteen and a half years since I was personally
asked to test a personal problem: then it was the case of an attempt to poison the French President
at a Lord Mayor's Banquet. It is now, I understand, a question of whether some friend of yours
called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend of hers called Todhunter. Well, Mr Brown,
I am a sportsman. I will take it on. I will give the MacNab family my best advice, as good
as I gave the French Republic and the King of England--no, better: fourteen years better. I
have nothing else to do this afternoon. Tell me your story."

The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth, but still with a
queer kind of simplicity. It was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking-room
for some trouble in passing the matches, than as if he were (as he was) practically thanking
the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him into a field to find a four-leaved clover. With
scarcely a semi-colon after his hearty thanks, the little man began his recital:

"I told you my name was Brown; well, that's the fact, and I'm the priest of the little Catholic
Church I dare say you've seen beyond those straggly streets, where the town ends towards the
north. In the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea like a sea-wall
there is a very honest but rather sharp-tempered member of my flock, a widow called MacNab.
She has one daughter, and she lets lodgings, and between her and the daughter, and between
her and the lodgers--well, I dare say there is a great deal to be said on both sides. At present
she has only one lodger, the young man called Todhunter; but he has given more trouble than
all the rest, for he wants to marry the young woman of the house."

"And the young woman of the house," asked Dr Hood, with huge and silent amusement, "what does
she want?"

"Why, she wants to marry him," cried Father Brown, sitting up eagerly. "That is just the awful
complication."

"It is indeed a hideous enigma," said Dr Hood.

"This young James Todhunter," continued the cleric, "is a very decent man so far as I know;
but then nobody knows very much. He is a bright, brownish little fellow, agile like a monkey,
clean-shaven like an actor, and obliging like a born courtier. He seems to have quite a pocketful
of money, but nobody knows what his trade is. Mrs MacNab, therefore (being of a pessimistic
turn), is quite sure it is something dreadful, and probably connected with dynamite. The dynamite
must be of a shy and noiseless sort, for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several
hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door. He declares his privacy is temporary
and justified, and promises to explain before the wedding. That is all that anyone knows for
certain, but Mrs MacNab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of. You know
how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that. There are tales of two
voices heard talking in the room; though, when the door is opened, Todhunter is always found
alone. There are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat, who once came out of the sea-mists
and apparently out of the sea, stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small
back garden at twilight, till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window. The colloquy
seemed to end in a quarrel. Todhunter dashed down his window with violence, and the man in
the high hat melted into the sea-fog again. This story is told by the family with the fiercest
mystification; but I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale: that the Other
Man (or whatever it is) crawls out every night from the big box in the corner, which is kept
locked all day. You see, therefore, how this sealed door of Todhunter's is treated as the gate
of all the fancies and monstrosities of the 'Thousand and One Nights'. And yet there is the
little fellow in his respectable black jacket, as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock.
He pays his rent to the tick; he is practically a teetotaller; he is tirelessly kind with the
younger children, and can keep them amused for a day on end; and, last and most urgent of all,
he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter, who is ready to go to church
with him tomorrow."

A man warmly concerned with any large theories has always a relish for applying them to any
triviality. The great specialist having condescended to the priest's simplicity, condescended
expansively. He settled himself with comfort in his arm-chair and began to talk in the tone
of a somewhat absent-minded lecturer:

"Even in a minute instance, it is best to look first to the main tendencies of Nature. A particular
flower may not be dead in early winter, but the flowers are dying; a particular pebble may
never be wetted with the tide, but the tide is coming in. To the scientific eye all human history
is a series of collective movements, destructions or migrations, like the massacre of flies
in winter or the return of birds in spring. Now the root fact in all history is Race. Race
produces religion; Race produces legal and ethical wars. There is no stronger case than that
of the wild, unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends
the MacNabs are specimens. Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and drifting blood, they accept
easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents, just as they still accept (you will
excuse me for saying) that superstitious explanation of all incidents which you and your Church
represent. It is not remarkable that such people, with the sea moaning behind them and the
Church (excuse me again) droning in front of them, should put fantastic features into what
are probably plain events. You, with your small parochial responsibilities, see only this particular
Mrs MacNab, terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of the sea.
But the man with the scientific imagination sees, as it were, the whole clans of MacNab scattered
over the whole world, in its ultimate average as uniform as a tribe of birds. He sees thousands
of Mrs MacNabs, in thousands of houses, dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea-cups
of their friends; he sees--"

Before the scientist could conclude his sentence, another and more impatient summons sounded
from without; someone with swishing skirts was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, and
the door opened on a young girl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste. She
had sea-blown blonde hair, and would have been entirely beautiful if her cheek-bones had not
been, in the Scotch manner, a little high in relief as well as in colour. Her apology was almost
as abrupt as a command.

"I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir," she said, "but I had to follow Father Brown at once; it's
nothing less than life or death."

Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder. "Why, what has happened, Maggie?" he said.

"James has been murdered, for all I can make out," answered the girl, still breathing hard
from her rush. "That man Glass has been with him again; I heard them talking through the door
quite plain. Two separate voices: for James speaks low, with a burr, and the other voice was
high and quavery."

"That man Glass?" repeated the priest in some perplexity.

"I know his name is Glass," answered the girl, in great impatience. "I heard it through the
door. They were quarrelling--about money, I think--for I heard James say again and again, 'That's
right, Mr Glass,' or 'No, Mr Glass,' and then, 'Two or three, Mr Glass.' But we're talking
too much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet."

"But time for what?" asked Dr Hood, who had been studying the young lady with marked interest.
"What is there about Mr Glass and his money troubles that should impel such urgency?"

"I tried to break down the door and couldn't," answered the girl shortly, "Then I ran to the
back-yard, and managed to climb on to the window-sill that looks into the room. It was an dim,
and seemed to be empty, but I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner, as if he were
drugged or strangled."

"This is very serious," said Father Brown, gathering his errant hat and umbrella and standing
up; "in point of fact I was just putting your case before this gentleman, and his view--"

"Has been largely altered," said the scientist gravely. "I do not think this young lady is
so Celtic as I had supposed. As I have nothing else to do, I will put on my hat and stroll
down town with you."

In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of the MacNabs' street: the girl
with the stern and breathless stride of the mountaineer, the criminologist with a lounging
grace (which was not without a certain leopard-like swiftness), and the priest at an energetic
trot entirely devoid of distinction. The aspect of this edge of the town was not entirely without
justification for the doctor's hints about desolate moods and environments. The scattered houses
stood farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashore; the afternoon was closing
with a premature and partly lurid twilight; the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously.
In the scrappy back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand, two black, barren-looking
trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment, and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street
to meet them with lean hands similarly spread, and her fierce face in shadow, she was a little
like a demon herself. The doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill reiterations
of her daughter's story, with more disturbing details of her own, to the divided vows of vengeance
against Mr Glass for murdering, and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered, or against the
latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter, and for not having lived to do it. They
passed through the narrow passage in the front of the house until they came to the lodger's
door at the back, and there Dr Hood, with the trick of an old detective, put his shoulder sharply
to the panel and burst in the door.

It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe. No one seeing it, even for a flash, could doubt
that the room had been the theatre of some thrilling collision between two, or perhaps more,
persons. Playing-cards lay littered across the table or fluttered about the floor as if a game
had been interrupted. Two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side-table, but a third lay
smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet. A few feet from it lay what looked like a long
knife or short sword, straight, but with an ornamental and pictured handle, its dull blade
just caught a grey glint from the dreary window behind, which showed the black trees against
the leaden level of the sea. Towards the opposite corner of the room was rolled a gentleman's
silk top hat, as if it had just been knocked off his head; so much so, indeed, that one almost
looked to see it still rolling. And in the corner behind it, thrown like a sack of potatoes,
but corded like a railway trunk, lay Mr James Todhunter, with a scarf across his mouth, and
six or seven ropes knotted round his elbows and ankles. His brown eyes were alive and shifted
alertly.

Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless
violence. Then he stepped swiftly across the carpet, picked up the tall silk hat, and gravely
put it upon the head of the yet pinioned Todhunter. It was so much too large for him that it
almost slipped down on to his shoulders.

"Mr Glass's hat," said the doctor, returning with it and peering into the inside with a pocket
lens. "How to explain the absence of Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass's hat? For Mr Glass
is not a careless man with his clothes. That hat is of a stylish shape and systematically brushed
and burnished, though not very new. An old dandy, I should think."

"But, good heavens!" called out Miss MacNab, "aren't you going to untie the man first?"

"I say 'old' with intention, though not with certainty" continued the expositor; "my reason
for it might seem a little far-fetched. The hair of human beings falls out in very varying
degrees, but almost always falls out slightly, and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs
in a hat recently worn. It has none, which leads me to guess that Mr Glass is bald. Now when
this is taken with the high-pitched and querulous voice which Miss MacNab described so vividly
(patience, my dear lady, patience), when we take the hairless head together with the tone common
in senile anger, I should think we may deduce some advance in years. Nevertheless, he was probably
vigorous, and he was almost certainly tall. I might rely in some degree on the story of his
previous appearance at the window, as a tall man in a silk hat, but I think I have more exact
indication. This wineglass has been smashed all over the place, but one of its splinters lies
on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece. No such fragment could have fallen there if the
vessel had been smashed in the hand of a comparatively short man like Mr Todhunter."

"By the way," said Father Brown, "might it not be as well to untie Mr Todhunter?"

"Our lesson from the drinking-vessels does not end here," proceeded the specialist. "I may
say at once that it is possible that the man Glass was bald or nervous through dissipation
rather than age. Mr Todhunter, as has been remarked, is a quiet thrifty gentleman, essentially
an abstainer. These cards and wine-cups are no part of his normal habit; they have been produced
for a particular companion. But, as it happens, we may go farther. Mr Todhunter may or may
not possess this wine-service, but there is no appearance of his possessing any wine. What,
then, were these vessels to contain? I would at once suggest some brandy or whisky, perhaps
of a luxurious sort, from a flask in the pocket of Mr Glass. We have thus something like a
picture of the man, or at least of the type: tall, elderly, fashionable, but somewhat frayed,
certainly fond of play and strong waters, perhaps rather too fond of them. Mr Glass is a gentleman
not unknown on the fringes of society."

"Look here," cried the young woman, "if you don't let me pass to untie him I'll run outside
and scream for the police."

"I should not advise you, Miss MacNab," said Dr Hood gravely, "to be in any hurry to fetch
the police. Father Brown, I seriously ask you to compose your flock, for their sakes, not for
mine. Well, we have seen something of the figure and quality of Mr Glass; what are the chief
facts known of Mr Todhunter? They are substantially three: that he is economical, that he is
more or less wealthy, and that he has a secret. Now, surely it is obvious that there are the
three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed. And surely it is equally obvious that
the faded finery, the profligate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr Glass are the unmistakable
marks of the kind of man who blackmails him. We have the two typical figures of a tragedy of
hush money: on the one hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other, the West-end
vulture with a scent for a mystery. These two men have met here today and have quarrelled,
using blows and a bare weapon."

"Are you going to take those ropes off?" asked the girl stubbornly.

Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table, and went across to the captive.
He studied him intently, even moving him a little and half-turning him round by the shoulders,
but he only answered:

"No; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends the police bring the handcuffs."

Father Brown, who had been looking dully at the carpet, lifted his round face and said: "What
do you mean?"

The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger-sword from the carpet and was examining
it intently as he answered:

"Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up," he said, "you all jump to the conclusion that Mr Glass
had tied him up; and then, I suppose, escaped. There are four objections to this: First, why
should a gentleman so dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him, if he left of his
own free will? Second," he continued, moving towards the window, "this is the only exit, and
it is locked on the inside. Third, this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point,
but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter. Mr Glass took that wound away with him, dead or alive.
Add to all this primary probability. It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would
try to kill his incubus, rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that
lays his golden egg. There, I think, we have a pretty complete story."

"But the ropes?" inquired the priest, whose eyes had remained open with a rather vacant admiration.

"Ah, the ropes," said the expert with a singular intonation. "Miss MacNab very much wanted
to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter free from his ropes. Well, I will tell her. I did not
do it because Mr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses."

"What?" cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment.

"I have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter," reiterated Hood quietly. "I happen to know
something about knots; they are quite a branch of criminal science. Every one of those knots
he has made himself and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made by an enemy
really trying to pinion him. The whole of this affair of the ropes is a clever fake, to make
us think him the victim of the struggle instead of the wretched Glass, whose corpse may be
hidden in the garden or stuffed up the chimney."

There was a rather depressed silence; the room was darkening, the sea-blighted boughs of the
garden trees looked leaner and blacker than ever, yet they seemed to have come nearer to the
window. One could almost fancy they were sea-monsters like krakens or cuttlefish, writhing
polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this tragedy, even as he, the villain
and victim of it, the terrible man in the tall hat, had once crawled up from the sea. For the
whole air was dense with the morbidity of blackmail, which is the most morbid of human things,
because it is a crime concealing a crime; a black plaster on a blacker wound.

The face of the little Catholic priest, which was commonly complacent and even comic, had suddenly
become knotted with a curious frown. It was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence.
It was rather that creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of an idea.
"Say it again, please," he said in a simple, bothered manner; "do you mean that Todhunter can
tie himself up all alone and untie himself all alone?"

"That is what I mean," said the doctor.

"Jerusalem!" ejaculated Brown suddenly, "I wonder if it could possibly be that!"

He scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit, and peered with quite a new impulsiveness
into the partially-covered face of the captive. Then he turned his own rather fatuous face
to the company. "Yes, that's it!" he cried in a certain excitement. "Can't you see it in the
man's face? Why, look at his eyes!"

Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance. And though the broad
black scarf completely masked the lower half of Todhunter's visage, they did grow conscious
of something struggling and intense about the upper part of it.

"His eyes do look queer," cried the young woman, strongly moved. "You brutes; I believe it's
hurting him!"

"Not that, I think," said Dr Hood; "the eyes have certainly a singular expression. But I should
interpret those transverse wrinkles as expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality--"

"Oh, bosh!" cried Father Brown: "can't you see he's laughing?"

"Laughing!" repeated the doctor, with a start; "but what on earth can he be laughing at?"

"Well," replied the Reverend Brown apologetically, "not to put too fine a point on it, I think
he is laughing at you. And indeed, I'm a little inclined to laugh at myself, now I know about it."

"Now you know about what?" asked Hood, in some exasperation.

"Now I know," replied the priest, "the profession of Mr Todhunter."

He shuffled about the room, looking at one object after another with what seemed to be a vacant
stare, and then invariably bursting into an equally vacant laugh, a highly irritating process
for those who had to watch it. He laughed very much over the hat, still more uproariously over
the broken glass, but the blood on the sword point sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement.
Then he turned to the fuming specialist.

"Dr Hood," he cried enthusiastically, "you are a great poet! You have called an uncreated being
out of the void. How much more godlike that is than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts!
Indeed, the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison."

"I have no notion what you are talking about," said Dr Hood rather haughtily; "my facts are
all inevitable, though necessarily incomplete. A place may be permitted to intuition, perhaps
(or poetry if you prefer the term), but only because the corresponding details cannot as yet
be ascertained. In the absence of Mr Glass--"

"That's it, that's it," said the little priest, nodding quite eagerly, "that's the first idea
to get fixed; the absence of Mr Glass. He is so extremely absent. I suppose," he added reflectively,
"that there was never anybody so absent as Mr Glass."

"Do you mean he is absent from the town?" demanded the doctor.

"I mean he is absent from everywhere," answered Father Brown; "he is absent from the Nature
of Things, so to speak."

"Do you seriously mean," said the specialist with a smile, "that there is no such person?"

The priest made a sign of assent. "It does seem a pity," he said.

Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh. "Well," he said, "before we go on to the hundred
and one other evidences, let us take the first proof we found; the first fact we fell over
when we fell into this room. If there is no Mr Glass, whose hat is this?"

"It is Mr Todhunter's," replied Father Brown.

"But it doesn't fit him," cried Hood impatiently. "He couldn't possibly wear it!"

Father Brown shook his head with ineffable mildness. "I never said he could wear it," he answered.
"I said it was his hat. Or, if you insist on a shade of difference, a hat that is his."

"And what is the shade of difference?" asked the criminologist with a slight sneer.

"My good sir," cried the mild little man, with his first movement akin to impatience, "if you
will walk down the street to the nearest hatter's shop, you will see that there is, in common
speech, a difference between a man's hat and the hats that are his."

"But a hatter," protested Hood, "can get money out of his stock of new hats. What could Todhunter
get out of this one old hat?"

"Rabbits," replied Father Brown promptly.

"What?" cried Dr Hood.

"Rabbits, ribbons, sweetmeats, goldfish, rolls of coloured paper," said the reverend gentleman
with rapidity. "Didn't you see it all when you found out the faked ropes? It's just the same
with the sword. Mr Todhunter hasn't got a scratch on him, as you say; but he's got a scratch
in him, if you follow me."

"Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes?" inquired Mrs MacNab sternly.

"I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes," said Father Brown. "I mean inside Mr Todhunter."

"Well, what in the name of Bedlam do you mean?"

"Mr Todhunter," explained Father Brown placidly, "is learning to be a professional conjurer,
as well as juggler, ventriloquist, and expert in the rope trick. The conjuring explains the
hat. It is without traces of hair, not because it is worn by the prematurely bald Mr Glass,
but because it has never been worn by anybody. The juggling explains the three glasses, which
Todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation. But, being only at the stage
of practice, he smashed one glass against the ceiling. And the juggling also explains the sword,
which it was Mr Todhunter's professional pride and duty to swallow. But, again, being at the
stage of practice, he very slightly grazed the inside of his throat with the weapon. Hence
he has a wound inside him, which I am sure (from the expression on his face) is not a serious
one. He was also practising the trick of a release from ropes, like the Davenport Brothers,
and he was just about to free himself when we all burst into the room. The cards, of course,
are for card tricks, and they are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising
one of those dodges of sending them flying through the air. He merely kept his trade secret,
because he had to keep his tricks secret, like any other conjurer. But the mere fact of an
idler in a top hat having once looked in at his back window, and been driven away by him with
great indignation, was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance, and make us imagine
his whole life overshadowed by the silk-hatted spectre of Mr Glass."

"But What about the two voices?" asked Maggie, staring.

"Have you never heard a ventriloquist?" asked Father Brown. "Don't you know they speak first
in their natural voice, and then answer themselves in just that shrill, squeaky, unnatural
voice that you heard?"

There was a long silence, and Dr Hood regarded the little man who had spoken with a dark and
attentive smile. "You are certainly a very ingenious person," he said; "it could not have been
done better in a book. But there is just one part of Mr Glass you have not succeeded in explaining
away, and that is his name. Miss MacNab distinctly heard him so addressed by Mr Todhunter."

The Rev. Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle. "Well, that," he said, "that's the silliest
part of the whole silly story. When our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in
turn, he counted them aloud as he caught them, and also commented aloud when he failed to catch
them. What he really said was: 'One, two and three--missed a glass one, two--missed a glass.'
And so on."

There was a second of stillness in the room, and then everyone with one accord burst out laughing.
As they did so the figure in the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall
with a flourish. Then, advancing into the middle of the room with a bow, he produced from his
pocket a big bill printed in blue and red, which announced that ZALADIN, the World's Greatest
Conjurer, Contortionist, Ventriloquist and Human Kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new
series of Tricks at the Empire Pavilion, Scarborough, on Monday next at eight o'clock precisely.

TWO. -- The Paradise of Thieves

THE great Muscari, most original of the young Tuscan poets, walked swiftly into his favourite
restaurant, which overlooked the Mediterranean, was covered by an awning and fenced by little
lemon and orange trees. Waiters in white aprons were already laying out on white tables the
insignia of an early and elegant lunch; and this seemed to increase a satisfaction that already
touched the top of swagger. Muscari had an eagle nose like Dante; his hair and neckerchief
were dark and flowing; he carried a black cloak, and might almost have carried a black mask,
so much did he bear with him a sort of Venetian melodrama. He acted as if a troubadour had
still a definite social office, like a bishop. He went as near as his century permitted to
walking the world literally like Don Juan, with rapier and guitar.

For he never travelled without a case of swords, with which he had fought many brilliant duels,
or without a corresponding case for his mandolin, with which he had actually serenaded Miss
Ethel Harrogate, the highly conventional daughter of a Yorkshire banker on a holiday. Yet he
was neither a charlatan nor a child; but a hot, logical Latin who liked a certain thing and
was it. His poetry was as straightforward as anyone else's prose. He desired fame or wine or
the beauty of women with a torrid directness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals or cloudy
compromises of the north; to vaguer races his intensity smelt of danger or even crime. Like
fire or the sea, he was too simple to be trusted.

The banker and his beautiful English daughter were staying at the hotel attached to Muscari's
restaurant; that was why it was his favourite restaurant. A glance flashed around the room
told him at once, however, that the English party had not descended. The restaurant was glittering,
but still comparatively empty. Two priests were talking at a table in a corner, but Muscari
(an ardent Catholic) took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows. But from a yet
farther seat, partly concealed behind a dwarf tree golden with oranges, there rose and advanced
towards the poet a person whose costume was the most aggressively opposite to his own.

This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check, with a pink tie, a sharp collar and protuberant
yellow boots. He contrived, in the true tradition of 'Arry at Margate, to look at once startling
and commonplace. But as the Cockney apparition drew nearer, Muscari was astounded to observe
that the head was distinctly different from the body. It was an Italian head: fuzzy, swarthy
and very vivacious, that rose abruptly out of the standing collar like cardboard and the comic
pink tie. In fact it was a head he knew. He recognized it, above all the dire erection of English
holiday array, as the face of an old but forgotten friend name Ezza. This youth had been a
prodigy at college, and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen; but when
he appeared in the world he failed, first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue, and then
privately for years on end as an actor, a traveller, a commission agent or a journalist. Muscari
had known him last behind the footlights; he was but too well attuned to the excitements of
that profession, and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up.

"Ezza!" cried the poet, rising and shaking hands in a pleasant astonishment. "Well, I've seen
you in many costumes in the green room; but I never expected to see you dressed up as an Englishman."

"This," answered Ezza gravely, "is not the costume of an Englishman, but of the Italian of
the future."

"In that case," remarked Muscari, "I confess I prefer the Italian of the past."

"That is your old mistake, Muscari," said the man in tweeds, shaking his head; "and the mistake
of Italy. In the sixteenth century we Tuscans made the morning: we had the newest steel, the
newest carving, the newest chemistry. Why should we not now have the newest factories, the
newest motors, the newest finance--the newest clothes?"

"Because they are not worth having," answered Muscari. "You cannot make Italians really progressive;
they are too intelligent. Men who see the short cut to good living will never go by the new
elaborate roads."

"Well, to me Marconi, or D'Annunzio, is the star of Italy" said the other. "That is why I have
become a Futurist--and a courier."

"A courier!" cried Muscari, laughing. "Is that the last of your list of trades? And whom are
you conducting?"

"Oh, a man of the name of Harrogate, and his family, I believe."

"Not the banker in this hotel?" inquired the poet, with some eagerness.

"That's the man," answered the courier.

"Does it pay well?" asked the troubadour innocently.

"It will pay me," said Ezza, with a very enigmatic smile. "But I am a rather curious sort of
courier." Then, as if changing the subject, he said abruptly: "He has a daughter--and a son."

"The daughter is divine," affirmed Muscari, "the father and son are, I suppose, human. But
granted his harmless qualities doesn't that banker strike you as a splendid instance of my
argument? Harrogate has millions in his safes, and I have--the hole in my pocket. But you daren't
say--you can't say--that he's cleverer than I, or bolder than I, or even more energetic. He's
not clever, he's got eyes like blue buttons; he's not energetic, he moves from chair to chair
like a paralytic. He's a conscientious, kindly old blockhead; but he's got money simply because
he collects money, as a boy collects stamps. You're too strong-minded for business, Ezza. You
won't get on. To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough to want it."

"I'm stupid enough for that," said Ezza gloomily. "But I should suggest a suspension of your
critique of the banker, for here he comes."

Mr Harrogate, the great financier, did indeed enter the room, but nobody looked at him. He
was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and faded grey-sandy moustaches; but for his
heavy stoop he might have been a colonel. He carried several unopened letters in his hand.
His son Frank was a really fine lad, curly-haired, sun-burnt and strenuous; but nobody looked
at him either. All eyes, as usual, were riveted, for the moment at least, upon Ethel Harrogate,
whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea,
like a goddess's. The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something, as
indeed he was. He was drinking the Classic; which his fathers made. Ezza studied her with a
gaze equally intense and far more baffling.

Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this occasion; and her family
had fallen into the easier Continental habit, allowing the stranger Muscari and even the courier
Ezza to share their table and their talk. In Ethel Harrogate conventionality crowned itself
with a perfection and splendour of its own. Proud of her father's prosperity, fond of fashionable
pleasures, a fond daughter but an arrant flirt, she was all these things with a sort of golden
good-nature that made her very pride pleasing and her worldly respectability a fresh and hearty
thing.

They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the mountain path they were
to attempt that week. The danger was not from rock and avalanche, but from something yet more
romantic. Ethel had been earnestly assured that brigands, the true cut-throats of the modern
legend, still haunted that ridge and held that pass of the Apennines.

"They say," she cried, with the awful relish of a schoolgirl, "that all that country isn't
ruled by the King of Italy, but by the King of Thieves. Who is the King of Thieves?"

"A great man," replied Muscari, "worthy to rank with your own Robin Hood, signorina. Montano,
the King of Thieves, was first heard of in the mountains some ten years ago, when people said
brigands were extinct. But his wild authority spread with the swiftness of a silent revolution.
Men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain village; his sentinels, gun in
hand, in every mountain ravine. Six times the Italian Government tried to dislodge him, and
was defeated in six pitched battles as if by Napoleon."

"Now that sort of thing," observed the banker weightily, "would never be allowed in England;
perhaps, after all, we had better choose another route. Porch are also natural. Fantastic to the church is not an Manor-house.

Walking of interest.
 It was more like a town crowd preventing the passage of the police than anything the
poet had ever pictured as the last stand of doomed and outlawed men of blood. Just as he was
rolling his eyes in bewilderment he felt a touch on his elbow, and found the odd little priest
standing there like a small Noah with a large hat, and requesting the favour of a word or two.

"Signor Muscari," said the cleric, "in this queer crisis personalities may be pardoned. I may
tell you without offence of a way in which you will do more good than by helping the gendarmes,
who are bound to break through in any case. You will permit me the impertinent intimacy, but
do you care about that girl? Care enough to marry her and make her a good husband, I mean?"

"Yes," said the poet quite simply.

"Does she care about you?"

"I think so," was the equally grave reply.

"Then go over there and offer yourself," said the priest: "offer her everything you can; offer
her heaven and earth if you've got them. The time is short."

"Why?" asked the astonished man of letters.

"Because," said Father Brown, "her Doom is coming up the road."

"Nothing is coming up the road," argued Muscari, "except the rescue."

"Well, you go over there," said his adviser, "and be ready to rescue her from the rescue."

Almost as he spoke the hedges were broken all along the ridge by a rush of the escaping brigands.
They dived into bushes and thick grass like defeated men pursued; and the great cocked hats
of the mounted gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge. Another order was
given; there was a noise of dismounting, and a tall officer with cocked hat, a grey imperial,
and a paper in his hand appeared in the gap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves. There
was a momentary silence, broken in an extraordinary way by the banker, who cried out in a hoarse
and strangled voice: "Robbed! I've been robbed!"

"Why, that was hours ago," cried his son in astonishment: "when you were robbed of two thousand
pounds."

"Not of two thousand pounds," said the financier, with an abrupt and terrible composure, "only
of a small bottle."

The policeman with the grey imperial was striding across the green hollow. Encountering the
King of the Thieves in his path, he clapped him on the shoulder with something between a caress
and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him staggering away. "You'll get into trouble, too,"
he said, "if you play these tricks."

Again to Muscari's artistic eye it seemed scarcely like the capture of a great outlaw at bay.
Passing on, the policeman halted before the Harrogate group and said: "Samuel Harrogate, I
arrest you in the name of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and Huddersfield Bank."

The great banker nodded with an odd air of business assent, seemed to reflect a moment, and
before they could interpose took a half turn and a step that brought him to the edge of the
outer mountain wall. Then, flinging up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach.
But this time he did not fall into a little meadow just beneath; he fell a thousand feet below,
to become a wreck of bones in the valley.

The anger of the Italian policeman, which he expressed volubly to Father Brown, was largely
mixed with admiration. "It was like him to escape us at last," he said. "He was a great brigand
if you like. This last trick of his I believe to be absolutely unprecedented. He fled with
the company's money to Italy, and actually got himself captured by sham brigands in his own
pay, so as to explain both the disappearance of the money and the disappearance of himself.
That demand for ransom was really taken seriously by most of the police. But for years he's
been doing things as good as that, quite as good as that. He will be a serious loss to his family."

Muscari was leading away the unhappy daughter, who held hard to him, as she did for many a
year after. But even in that tragic wreck he could not help having a smile and a hand of half-mocking
friendship for the indefensible Ezza Montano. "And where are you going next?" he asked him
over his shoulder.

"Birmingham," answered the actor, puffing a cigarette. "Didn't I tell you I was a Futurist?
I really do believe in those things if I believe in anything. Change, bustle and new things
every morning. I am going to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Huddersfield, Glasgow, Chicago--in
short, to enlightened, energetic, civilized society!"

"In short," said Muscari, "to the real Paradise of Thieves."

THREE -- The Duel of Dr Hirsch

M. MAURICE BRUN and M. Armand Armagnac were crossing the sunlit Champs Elysee with a kind of
vivacious respectability. They were both short, brisk and bold. They both had black beards
that did not seem to belong to their faces, after the strange French fashion which makes real
hair look like artificial. M. Brun had a dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower
lip. M. Armagnac, by way of a change, had two beards; one sticking out from each corner of
his emphatic chin. They were both young. They were both atheists, with a depressing fixity
of outlook but great mobility of exposition. They were both pupils of the great Dr Hirsch,
scientist, publicist and moralist.

M. Brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common expression "Adieu" should be obliterated
from all the French classics, and a slight fine imposed for its use in private life. "Then,"
he said, "the very name of your imagined God will have echoed for the last time in the ear
of man." M. Armagnac specialized rather in a resistance to militarism, and wished the chorus
of the Marseillaise altered from "Aux armes, citoyens" to "Aux greves, citoyens". But his antimilitarism
was of a peculiar and Gallic sort. An eminent and very wealthy English Quaker, who had come
to see him to arrange for the disarmament of the whole planet, was rather distressed by Armagnac's
proposal that (by way of beginning) the soldiers should shoot their officers.

And indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most from their leader and father
in philosophy. Dr Hirsch, though born in France and covered with the most triumphant favours
of French education, was temperamentally of another type--mild, dreamy, humane; and, despite
his sceptical system, not devoid of transcendentalism. He was, in short, more like a German
than a Frenchman; and much as they admired him, something in the subconsciousness of these
Gauls was irritated at his pleading for peace in so peaceful a manner. To their party throughout
Europe, however, Paul Hirsch was a saint of science. His large and daring cosmic theories advertised
his austere life and innocent, if somewhat frigid, morality; he held something of the position
of Darwin doubled with the position of Tolstoy. But he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot;
his views on disarmament were moderate and evolutionary--the Republican Government put considerable
confidence in him as to various chemical improvements. He had lately even discovered a noiseless
explosive, the secret of which the Government was carefully guarding.

His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee--a street which in that strong summer
seemed almost as full of foliage as the park itself; a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine,
interrupted only in one place where a large cafe ran out into the street. Almost opposite to
this were the white and green blinds of the great scientist's house, an iron balcony, also
painted green, running along in front of the first-floor windows. Beneath this was the entrance
into a kind of court, gay with shrubs and tiles, into which the two Frenchmen passed in animated
talk.

The door was opened to them by the doctor's old servant, Simon, who might very well have passed
for a doctor himself, having a strict suit of black, spectacles, grey hair, and a confidential
manner. In fact, he was a far more presentable man of science than his master, Dr Hirsch, who
was a forked radish of a fellow, with just enough bulb of a head to make his body insignificant.
With all the gravity of a great physician handling a prescription, Simon handed a letter to
M. Armagnac. That gentleman ripped it up with a racial impatience, and rapidly read the following:

I cannot come down to speak to you. There is a man in this house whom I refuse to meet. He
is a Chauvinist officer, Dubosc. He is sitting on the stairs. He has been kicking the furniture
about in all the other rooms; I have locked myself in my study, opposite that cafe. If you
love me, go over to the cafe and wait at one of the tables outside. I will try to send him
over to you. I want you to answer him and deal with him. I cannot meet him myself. I cannot:
I will not.

There is going to be another Dreyfus case.

P. HIRSCH

M. Armagnac looked at M. Brun. M. Brun borrowed the letter, read it, and looked at M. Armagnac.
Then both betook themselves briskly to one of the little tables under the chestnuts opposite,
where they procured two tall glasses of horrible green absinthe, which they could drink apparently
in any weather and at any time. Otherwise the cafe seemed empty, except for one soldier drinking
coffee at one table, and at another a large man drinking a small syrup and a priest drinking
nothing.

Maurice Brun cleared his throat and said: "Of course we must help the master in every way, but--"

There was an abrupt silence, and Armagnac said: "He may have excellent reasons for not meeting
the man himself, but--"

Before either could complete a sentence, it was evident that the invader had been expelled
from the house opposite. The shrubs under the archway swayed and burst apart, as that unwelcome
guest was shot out of them like a cannon-ball.

He was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat, a figure that had indeed something
generally Tyrolean about it. The man's shoulders were big and broad, but his legs were neat
and active in knee-breeches and knitted stockings. His face was brown like a nut; he had very
bright and restless brown eyes; his dark hair was brushed back stiffly in front and cropped
close behind, outlining a square and powerful skull; and he had a huge black moustache like
the horns of a bison. Such a substantial head is generally based on a bull neck; but this was
hidden by a big coloured scarf, swathed round up the man's ears and falling in front inside
his jacket like a sort of fancy waistcoat. It was a scarf of strong dead colours, dark red
and old gold and purple, probably of Oriental fabrication. Altogether the man had something
a shade barbaric about him; more like a Hungarian squire than an ordinary French officer. His
French, however, was obviously that of a native; and his French patriotism was so impulsive
as to be slightly absurd. His first act when he burst out of the archway was to call in a clarion
voice down the street: "Are there any Frenchmen here?" as if he were calling for Christians
in Mecca.

Armagnac and Brun instantly stood up; but they were too late. Men were already running from
the street corners; there was a small but ever-clustering crowd. With the prompt French instinct
for the politics of the street, the man with the black moustache had already run across to
a corner of the cafe, sprung on one of the tables, and seizing a branch of chestnut to steady
himself, shouted as Camille Desmoulins once shouted when he scattered the oak-leaves among
the populace.

"Frenchmen!" he volleyed; "I cannot speak! God help me, that is why I am speaking! The fellows
in their filthy parliaments who learn to speak also learn to be silent--silent as that spy
cowering in the house opposite! Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door! Silent as
he is now, though he hears my voice across this street and shakes where he sits! Oh, they can
be silent eloquently--the politicians! But the time has come when we that cannot speak must
speak. You are betrayed to the Prussians. Betrayed at this moment. Betrayed by that man. I
am Jules Dubosc, Colonel of Artillery, Belfort. We caught a German spy in the Vosges yesterday,
and a paper was found on him--a paper I hold in my hand. Oh, they tried to hush it up; but
I took it direct to the man who wrote it--the man in that house! It is in his hand. It is signed
with his initials. It is a direction for finding the secret of this new Noiseless Powder. Hirsch
invented it; Hirsch wrote this note about it. This note is in German, and was found in a German's
pocket. 'Tell the man the formula for powder is in grey envelope in first drawer to the left
of Secretary's desk, War Office, in red ink. He must be careful. P.H.'"

He rattled short sentences like a quick-firing gun, but he was plainly the sort of man who
is either mad or right. The mass of the crowd was Nationalist, and already in threatening uproar;
and a minority of equally angry Intellectuals, led by Armagnac and Brun, only made the majority
more militant.

"If this is a military secret," shouted Brun, "why do you yell about it in the street?"

"I will tell you why I do!" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd. "I went to this man in straight
and civil style. If he had any explanation it could have been given in complete confidence.
He refuses to explain. He refers me to two strangers in a cafe as to two flunkeys. He has thrown
me out of the house, but I am going back into it, with the people of Paris behind me!"

A shout seemed to shake the very facade of mansions and two stones flew, one breaking a window
above the balcony. The indignant Colonel plunged once more under the archway and was heard
crying and thundering inside. Every instant the human sea grew wider and wider; it surged up
against the rails and steps of the traitor's house; it was already certain that the place would
be burst into like the Bastille, when the broken french window opened and Dr Hirsch came out
on the balcony. For an instant the fury half turned to laughter; for he was an absurd figure
in such a scene. His long bare neck and sloping shoulders were the shape of a champagne bottle,
but that was the only festive thing about him. His coat hung on him as on a peg; he wore his
carrot-coloured hair long and weedy; his cheeks and chin were fully fringed with one of those
irritating beards that begin far from the mouth. He was very pale, and he wore blue spectacles.

Livid as he was, he spoke with a sort of prim decision, so that the mob fell silent in the
middle of his third sentence.

"...only two things to say to you now. The first is to my foes, the second to my friends. To
my foes I say: It is true I will not meet M. Dubosc, though he is storming outside this very
room. It is true I have asked two other men to confront him for me. And I will tell you why!
Because I will not and must not see him--because it would be against all rules of dignity and
honour to see him. Before I am triumphantly cleared before a court, there is another arbitration
this gentleman owes me as a gentleman, and in referring him to my seconds I am strictly--"

Armagnac and Brun were waving their hats wildly, and even the Doctor's enemies roared applause
at this unexpected defiance. Once more a few sentences were inaudible, but they could hear
him say: "To my friends--I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual, and to
these an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself. But our own most precious truth is
the fundamental force of matter and heredity. My books are successful; my theories are unrefuted;
but I suffer in politics from a prejudice almost physical in the French. Quietly have the fire he ran

The burg when something delicately have extended to Go who was raise ago when the guidance was

could be shortly have plunged for wood and fifty pedestrians have merely. Head, the sir, all flambeau.
Sermon has woken from formalities, and Frost is only did an young-universe, the holidays and
were again see to admiral, but why he looked just curly attending.
 The more you mixed with the innermost ring in every polity or
profession, the more often you met Sir Wilson Seymour. He was the one intelligent man on twenty
unintelligent committees--on every sort of subject, from the reform of the Royal Academy to
the project of bimetallism for Greater Britain. In the Arts especially he was omnipotent. He
was so unique that nobody could quite decide whether he was a great aristocrat who had taken
up Art, or a great artist whom the aristocrats had taken up. But you could not meet him for
five minutes without realizing that you had really been ruled by him all your life.

His appearance was "distinguished" in exactly the same sense; it was at once conventional and
unique. Fashion could have found no fault with his high silk hat--, yet it was unlike anyone
else's hat--a little higher, perhaps, and adding something to his natural height. His tall,
slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked the reverse of feeble. His hair was silver-grey,
but he did not look old; it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate;
it was curly but it did not look curled. His carefully pointed beard made him look more manly
and militant than otherwise, as it does in those old admirals of Velazquez with whose dark
portraits his house was hung. His grey gloves were a shade bluer, his silver-knobbed cane a
shade longer than scores of such gloves and canes flapped and flourished about the theatres
and the restaurants.

The other man was not so tall, yet would have struck nobody as short, but merely as strong
and handsome. His hair also was curly, but fair and cropped close to a strong, massive head--the
sort of head you break a door with, as Chaucer said of the Miller's. His military moustache
and the carriage of his shoulders showed him a soldier, but he had a pair of those peculiar
frank and piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors. His face was somewhat square,
his jaw was square, his shoulders were square, even his jacket was square. Indeed, in the wild
school of caricature then current, Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as a proposition in
the fourth book of Euclid.

For he also was a public man, though with quite another sort of success. You did not have to
be in the best society to have heard of Captain Cutler, of the siege of Hong-Kong, and the
great march across China. You could not get away from hearing of him wherever you were; his
portrait was on every other postcard; his maps and battles in every other illustrated paper;
songs in his honour in every other music-hall turn or on every other barrel-organ. His fame,
though probably more temporary, was ten times more wide, popular and spontaneous than the other
man's. In thousands of English homes he appeared enormous above England, like Nelson. Yet he
had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson Seymour.

The door was opened to them by an aged servant or "dresser", whose broken-down face and figure
and black shabby coat and trousers contrasted queerly with the glittering interior of the great
actress's dressing-room. It was fitted and filled with looking-glasses at every angle of refraction,
so that they looked like the hundred facets of one huge diamond--if one could get inside a
diamond. The other features of luxury, a few flowers, a few coloured cushions, a few scraps
of stage costume, were multiplied by all the mirrors into the madness of the Arabian Nights,
and danced and changed places perpetually as the shuffling attendant shifted a mirror outwards
or shot one back against the wall.

They both spoke to the dingy dresser by name, calling him Parkinson, and asking for the lady
as Miss Aurora Rome. Parkinson said she was in the other room, but he would go and tell her.
A shade crossed the brow of both visitors; for the other room was the private room of the great
actor with whom Miss Aurora was performing, and she was of the kind that does not inflame admiration
without inflaming jealousy. In about half a minute, however, the inner door opened, and she
entered as she always did, even in private life, so that the very silence seemed to be a roar
of applause, and one well-deserved. She was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green
and peacock blue satins, that gleamed like blue and green metals, such as delight children
and aesthetes, and her heavy, hot brown hair framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous
to all men, but especially to boys and to men growing grey. In company with her male colleague,
the great American actor, Isidore Bruno, she was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic
interpretation of Midsummer Night's Dream: in which the artistic prominence was given to Oberon
and Titania, or in other words to Bruno and herself. Set in dreamy and exquisite scenery, and
moving in mystical dances, the green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the
elusive individuality of an elfin queen. But when personally confronted in what was still broad
daylight, a man looked only at the woman's face.

She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so many males at the same
just dangerous distance from her. She accepted some flowers from Cutler, which were as tropical
and expensive as his victories; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour, offered
later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman. For it was against his breeding to show eagerness,
and against his conventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers. He had
picked up a trifle, he said, which was rather a curiosity, it was an ancient Greek dagger of
the Mycenaean Epoch, and might well have been worn in the time of Theseus and Hippolyta. It
was made of brass like all the Heroic weapons, but, oddly enough, sharp enough to prick anyone
still. He had really been attracted to it by the leaf-like shape; it was as perfect as a Greek
vase. If it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could come in anywhere in the play, he hoped
she would--

The inner door burst open and a big figure appeared, who was more of a contrast to the explanatory
Seymour than even Captain Cutler. Nearly six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and
muscles, Isidore Bruno, in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden-brown garments of Oberon, looked
like a barbaric god. He leaned on a sort of hunting-spear, which across a theatre looked a
slight, silvery wand, but which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain
as a pike-staff--and as menacing. His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically, his bronzed face,
handsome as it was, showed at that moment a combination of high cheekbones with set white teeth,
which recalled certain American conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations.

"Aurora," he began, in that deep voice like a drum of passion that had moved so many audiences,
"will you--"

He stopped indecisively because a sixth figure had suddenly presented itself just inside the
doorway--a figure so incongruous in the scene as to be almost comic. It was a very short man
in the black uniform of the Roman secular clergy, and looking (especially in such a presence
as Bruno's and Aurora's) rather like the wooden Noah out of an ark. He did not, however, seem
conscious of any contrast, but said with dull civility: "I believe Miss Rome sent for me."

A shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature rather rose at so unemotional
an interruption. The detachment of a professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that
they stood round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals; just as a stranger coming in with frost
on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace. The presence of the one man who did
not care about her increased Miss Rome's sense that everybody else was in love with her, and
each in a somewhat dangerous way: the actor with all the appetite of a savage and a spoilt
child; the soldier with all the simple selfishness of a man of will rather than mind; Sir Wilson
with that daily hardening concentration with which old Hedonists take to a hobby; nay, even
the abject Parkinson, who had known her before her triumphs, and who followed her about the
room with eyes or feet, with the dumb fascination of a dog.

A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing. The man like a black wooden Noah (who
was not wholly without shrewdness) noted it with a considerable but contained amusement. It
was evident that the great Aurora, though by no means indifferent to the admiration of the
other sex, wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men who admired her and be left alone
with the man who did not--did not admire her in that sense at least; for the little priest
did admire and even enjoy the firm feminine diplomacy with which she set about her task. There
was, perhaps, only one thing that Aurora Rome was clever about, and that was one half of humanity--the
other half. The little priest watched, like a Napoleonic campaign, the swift precision of her
policy for expelling all while banishing none. Bruno, the big actor, was so babyish that it
was easy to send him off in brute sulks, banging the door. Cutler, the British officer, was
pachydermatous to ideas, but punctilious about behaviour. He would ignore all hints, but he
would die rather than ignore a definite commission from a lady. As to old Seymour, he had to
be treated differently; he had to be left to the last. The only way to move him was to appeal
to him in confidence as an old friend, to let him into the secret of the clearance. The priest
did really admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action.

She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner: "I shall value all these
flowers, because they must be your favourite flowers. But they won't be complete, you know,
without my favourite flower. Do go over to that shop round the corner and get me some lilies-of-the-valley,
and then it will be quite lovely."

The first object of her diplomacy, the exit of the enraged Bruno, was at once achieved. He
had already handed his spear in a lordly style, like a sceptre, to the piteous Parkinson, and
was about to assume one of the cushioned seats like a throne. But at this open appeal to his
rival there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence of the slave; he knotted
his enormous brown fists for an instant, and then, dashing open the door, disappeared into
his own apartments beyond. But meanwhile Miss Rome's experiment in mobilizing the British Army
had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable. Cutler had indeed risen stiffly and suddenly,
and walked towards the door, hatless, as if at a word of command. But perhaps there was something
ostentatiously elegant about the languid figure of Seymour leaning against one of the looking-glasses
that brought him up short at the entrance, turning his head this way and that like a bewildered
bulldog.

"I must show this stupid man where to go," said Aurora in a whisper to Seymour, and ran out
to the threshold to speed the parting guest.

Seymour seemed to be listening, elegant and unconscious as was his posture, and he seemed relieved
when he heard the lady call out some last instructions to the Captain, and then turn sharply
and run laughing down the passage towards the other end, the end on the terrace above the Thames.
Yet a second or two after Seymour's brow darkened again. A man in his position has so many
rivals, and he remembered that at the other end of the passage was the corresponding entrance
to Bruno's private room. He did not lose his dignity; he said some civil words to Father Brown
about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster Cathedral, and then, quite naturally,
strolled out himself into the upper end of the passage. Father Brown and Parkinson were left
alone, and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous conversation. The dresser
went round the room, pulling out looking-glasses and pushing them in again, his dingy dark
coat and trousers looking all the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy
spear of King Oberon. Every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass, a new black figure
of Father Brown appeared; the absurd glass chamber was full of Father Browns, upside down in
the air like angels, turning somersaults like acrobats, turning their backs to everybody like
very rude persons.

Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses, but followed Parkinson with
an idly attentive eye till he took himself and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno.
Then he abandoned himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him--calculating the
angles of the mirrors, the angles of each refraction, the angle at which each must fit into
the wall...when he heard a strong but strangled cry.

He sprang to his feet and stood rigidly listening. At the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst
back into the room, white as ivory. "Who's that man in the passage?" he cried. "Where's that
dagger of mine?"

Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was plunging about the room looking
for the weapon. And before he could possibly find that weapon or any other, a brisk running
of feet broke upon the pavement outside, and the square face of Cutler was thrust into the
same doorway. He was still grotesquely grasping a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley. "What's this?"
he cried. "What's that creature down the passage? Is this some of your tricks?"

"My tricks!" hissed his pale rival, and made a stride towards him.

In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown stepped out into the top of
the passage, looked down it, and at once walked briskly towards what he saw.

At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him, Cutler calling out: "What
are you doing? Who are you?"

"My name is Brown," said the priest sadly, as he bent over something and straightened himself
again. "Miss Rome sent for me, and I came as quickly as I could. I have come too late."

The three men looked down, and in one of them at least the life died in that late light of
afternoon. It ran along the passage like a path of gold, and in the midst of it Aurora Rome
lay lustrous in her robes of green and gold, with her dead face turned upwards. Her dress was
torn away as in a struggle, leaving the right shoulder bare, but the wound from which the blood
was welling was on the other side. The brass dagger lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away.

There was a blank stillness for a measurable time, so that they could hear far off a flower-girl's
laugh outside Charing Cross, and someone whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets
off the Strand. Then the Captain, with a movement so sudden that it might have been passion
or play-acting, took Sir Wilson Seymour by the throat.

Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear. "You need not kill me," he said
in a voice quite cold; "I shall do that on my own account."

The Captain's hand hesitated and dropped; and the other added with the same icy candour: "If
I find I haven't the nerve to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink."

"Drink isn't good enough for me," replied Cutler, "but I'll have blood for this before I die.
Not yours--but I think I know whose."

And before the others could appreciate his intention he snatched up the dagger, sprang at the
other door at the lower end of the passage, burst it open, bolt and all, and confronted Bruno
in his dressing-room. As he did so, old Parkinson tottered in his wavering way out of the door
and caught sight of the corpse lying in the passage. He moved shakily towards it; looked at
it weakly with a working face; then moved shakily back into the dressing-room again, and sat
down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs. Father Brown instantly ran across to him,
taking no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor, though the room already rang with their
blows and they began to struggle for the dagger. Seymour, who retained some practical sense,
was whistling for the police at the end of the passage.

When the police arrived it was to tear the two men from an almost ape-like grapple; and, after
a few formal inquiries, to arrest Isidore Bruno upon a charge of murder, brought against him
by his furious opponent. The idea that the great national hero of the hour had arrested a wrongdoer
with his own hand doubtless had its weight with the police, who are not without elements of
the journalist. They treated Cutler with a certain solemn attention, and pointed out that he
had got a slight slash on the hand. Even as Cutler bore him back across tilted chair and table,
Bruno had twisted the dagger out of his grasp and disabled him just below the wrist. The injury
was really slight, but till he was removed from the room the half-savage prisoner stared at
the running blood with a steady smile.

"Looks a cannibal sort of chap, don't he?" said the constable confidentially to Cutler.

Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after: "We must attend to the...the death..."
and his voice escaped from articulation.

"The two deaths," came in the voice of the priest from the farther side of the room. "This
poor fellow was gone when I got across to him." And he stood looking down at old Parkinson,
who sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair. He also had paid his tribute, not without
eloquence, to the woman who had died.

The silence was first broken by Cutler, who seemed not untouched by a rough tenderness. "I
wish I was him," he said huskily. "I remember he used to watch her wherever she walked more
than--anybody. She was his air, and he's dried up. He's just dead."

"We are all dead," said Seymour in a strange voice, looking down the road.

They took leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road, with some random apologies for any
rudeness they might have shown. Both their faces were tragic, but also cryptic.

The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit-warren of wild thoughts that jumped too quickly
for him to catch them. Like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that he
was certain of their grief, but not so certain of their innocence.

"We had better all be going," said Seymour heavily; "we have done all we can to help."

"Will you understand my motives," asked Father Brown quietly, "if I say you have done all you
can to hurt?"

They both started as if guiltily, and Cutler said sharply: "To hurt whom?"

"To hurt yourselves," answered the priest. "I would not add to your troubles if it weren't
common justice to warn you. You've done nearly everything you could do to hang yourselves,
if this actor should be acquitted. They'll be sure to subpoena me; I shall be bound to say
that after the cry was heard each of you rushed into the room in a wild state and began quarrelling
about a dagger. As far as my words on oath can go, you might either of you have done it. You
hurt yourselves with that; and then Captain Cutler must have hurt himself with the dagger."

"Hurt myself!" exclaimed the Captain, with contempt. "A silly little scratch."

"Which drew blood," replied the priest, nodding. "We know there's blood on the brass now. And
so we shall never know whether there was blood on it before."

There was a silence; and then Seymour said, with an emphasis quite alien to his daily accent:
"But I saw a man in the passage."

"I know you did," answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood, "so did Captain Cutler. That's
what seems so improbable."

Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer, Father Brown had politely excused
himself and gone stumping up the road with his stumpy old umbrella.

As modern newspapers are conducted, the most honest and most important news is the police news.
If it be true that in the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics,
it is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject. But even this would hardly
explain the enormous omnipresence and widely distributed detail of "The Bruno Case," or "The
Passage Mystery," in the Press of London and the provinces. So vast was the excitement that
for some weeks the Press really told the truth; and the reports of examination and cross-examination,
if interminable, even if intolerable are at least reliable. The true reason, of course, was
the coincidence of persons. The victim was a popular actress; the accused was a popular actor;
and the accused had been caught red-handed, as it were, by the most popular soldier of the
patriotic season. In those extraordinary circumstances the Press was paralysed into probity
and accuracy; and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from
reports of Bruno's trial.

The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monkhouse, one of those who are jeered at as humorous
judges, but who are generally much more serious than the serious judges, for their levity comes
from a living impatience of professional solemnity; while the serious judge is really filled
with frivolity, because he is filled with vanity. All the chief actors being of a worldly importance,
the barristers were well balanced; the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray, a heavy,
but weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem English and trustworthy, and how to
be rhetorical with reluctance. The prisoner was defended by Mr Patrick Butler, K.C., who was
mistaken for a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the Irish character--and those who had
not been examined by him. The medical evidence involved no contradictions, the doctor, whom
Seymour had summoned on the spot, agreeing with the eminent surgeon who had later examined
the body. Aurora Rome had been stabbed with some sharp instrument such as a knife or dagger;
some instrument, at least, of which the blade was short. The wound was just over the heart,
and she had died instantly. When the doctor first saw her she could hardly have been dead for
twenty minutes. Therefore when Father Brown found her she could hardly have been dead for three.

Some official detective evidence followed, chiefly concerned with the presence or absence of
any proof of a struggle; the only suggestion of this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder,
and this did not seem to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow.
When these details had been supplied, though not explained, the first of the important witnesses
was called.

Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else that he did at all--not only well,
but perfectly. Though himself much more of a public man than the judge, he conveyed exactly
the fine shade of self-effacement before the King's justice; and though everyone looked at
him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury, they could have said
nothing of his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman, with an accent on the
noun. He was also refreshingly lucid, as he was on the committees. He had been calling on Miss
Rome at the theatre; he had met Captain Cutler there; they had been joined for a short time
by the accused, who had then returned to his own dressing-room; they had then been joined by
a Roman Catholic priest, who asked for the deceased lady and said his name was Brown. Miss
Rome had then gone just outside the theatre to the entrance of the passage, in order to point
out to Captain Cutler a flower-shop at which he was to buy her some more flowers; and the witness
had remained in the room, exchanging a few words with the priest. He had then distinctly heard
the deceased, having sent the Captain on his errand, turn round laughing and run down the passage
towards its other end, where was the prisoner's dressing-room. In idle curiosity as to the
rapid movement of his friends, he had strolled out to the head of the passage himself and looked
down it towards the prisoner's door. Did he see anything in the passage? Yes; he saw something
in the passage.

Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval, during which the witness looked down, and
for all his usual composure seemed to have more than his usual pallor. Then the barrister said
in a lower voice, which seemed at once sympathetic and creepy: "Did you see it distinctly?"

Sir Wilson Seymour, however moved, had his excellent brains in full working-order. "Very distinctly
as regards its outline, but quite indistinctly, indeed not at all, as regards the details inside
the outline. The passage is of such length that anyone in the middle of it appears quite black
against the light at the other end." The witness lowered his steady eyes once more and added:
"I had noticed the fact before, when Captain Cutler first entered it." There was another silence,
and the judge leaned forward and made a note.

"Well," said Sir Walter patiently, "what was the outline like? Was it, for instance, like the
figure of the murdered woman?"

"Not in the least," answered Seymour quietly.

"What did it look like to you?"

"It looked to me," replied the witness, "like a tall man."

Everyone in court kept his eyes riveted on his pen, or his umbrella-handle, or his book, or
his boots or whatever he happened to be looking at. They seemed to be holding their eyes away
from the prisoner by main force; but they felt his figure in the dock, and they felt it as
gigantic. Tall as Bruno was to the eye, he seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had
been torn away from him.

Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face, smoothing his black silk robes, and white
silk whiskers. Sir Wilson was leaving the witness-box, after a few final particulars to which
there were many other witnesses, when the counsel for the defence sprang up and stopped him.

"I shall only detain you a moment," said Mr Butler, who was a rustic-looking person with red
eyebrows and an expression of partial slumber. "Will you tell his lordship how you knew it
was a man?"

A faint, refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour's features. "I'm afraid it is the vulgar
test of trousers," he said. "When I saw daylight between the long legs I was sure it was a
man, after all."

Butler's sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion. "After all!" he repeated
slowly. "So you did think at first it was a woman?"

Seymour looked troubled for the first time. "It is hardly a point of fact," he said, "but if
his lordship would like me to answer for my impression, of course I shall do so. There was
something about the thing that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man; somehow
the curves were different. And it had something that looked like long hair."

"Thank you," said Mr Butler, K.C., and sat down suddenly, as if he had got what he wanted.

Captain Cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness than Sir Wilson, but his account
of the opening incidents was solidly the same. He described the return of Bruno to his dressing-room,
the dispatching of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley, his return to the upper
end of the passage, the thing he saw in the passage, his suspicion of Seymour, and his struggle
with Bruno. But he could give little artistic assistance about the black figure that he and
Seymour had seen. Asked about its outline, he said he was no art critic--with a somewhat too
obvious sneer at Seymour. Asked if it was a man or a woman, he said it looked more like a beast--with
a too obvious snarl at the prisoner. But the man was plainly shaken with sorrow and sincere
anger, and Cowdray quickly excused him from confirming facts that were already fairly clear.

The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross-examination; although (as was his custom)
even in being brief, he seemed to take a long time about it. "You used a rather remarkable
expression," he said, looking at Cutler sleepily. "What do you mean by saying that it looked
more like a beast than a man or a woman?"

Cutler seemed seriously agitated. "Perhaps I oughtn't to have said that," he said; "but when
the brute has huge humped shoulders like a chimpanzee, and bristles sticking out of its head
like a pig--"

Mr Butler cut short his curious impatience in the middle. "Never mind whether its hair was
like a pig's," he said, "was it like a woman's?"

"A woman's!" cried the soldier. "Great Scott, no!"

"The last witness said it was," commented the counsel, with unscrupulous swiftness. "And did
the figure have any of those serpentine and semi-feminine curves to which eloquent allusion
has been made? No? No feminine curves? The figure, if I understand you, was rather heavy and
square than otherwise?"

"He may have been bending forward," said Cutler, in a hoarse and rather faint voice.

"Or again, he may not," said Mr Butler, and sat down suddenly for the second time.

The third, witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was the little Catholic clergyman, so little,
compared with the others, that his head seemed hardly to come above the box, so that it was
like cross-examining a child. But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow got it into his head
(mostly by some ramifications of his family's religion) that Father Brown was on the side of
the prisoner, because the prisoner was wicked and foreign and even partly black. Therefore
he took Father Brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anything; and
told him to answer yes or no, and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry. When Father Brown
began, in his simplicity, to say who he thought the man in the passage was, the barrister told
him that he did not want his theories.

"A black shape was seen in the passage. And you say you saw the black shape. Well, what shape
was it?"

Father Brown blinked as under rebuke; but he had long known the literal nature of obedience.
"The shape," he said, "was short and thick, but had two sharp, black projections curved upwards
on each side of the head or top, rather like horns, and--"

"Oh! the devil with horns, no doubt," ejaculated Cowdray, sitting down in triumphant jocularity.
"It was the devil come to eat Protestants."

"No," said the priest dispassionately; "I know who it was."

Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational, but real sense of some monstrosity. They
had forgotten the figure in the dock and thought only of the figure in the passage. And the
figure in the passage, described by three capable and respectable men who had all seen it,
was a shifting nightmare: one called it a woman, and the other a beast, and the other a devil....

The judge was looking at Father Brown with level and piercing eyes. "You are a most extraordinary
witness," he said; "but there is something about you that makes me think you are trying to
tell the truth. Well, who was the man you saw in the passage?"

"He was myself," said Father Brown.

Butler, K.C., sprang to his feet in an extraordinary stillness, and said quite calmly: "Your
lordship will allow me to cross-examine?" And then, without stopping, he shot at Brown the
apparently disconnected question: "You have heard about this dagger; you know the experts say
the crime was committed with a short blade?"

"A short blade," assented Brown, nodding solemnly like an owl, "but a very long hilt."

Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest had really seen himself doing
murder with a short dagger with a long hilt (which seemed somehow to make it more horrible),
he had himself hurried on to explain.

"I mean daggers aren't the only things with short blades. Spears have short blades. And spears
catch at the end of the steel just like daggers, if they're that sort of fancy spear they had
in theatres; like the spear poor old Parkinson killed his wife with, just when she'd sent for
me to settle their family troubles--and I came just too late, God forgive me! But he died penitent--he
just died of being penitent. He couldn't bear what he'd done."

The general impression in court was that the little priest, who was gobbling away, had literally
gone mad in the box. But the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest;
and the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed.

"If Parkinson did it with that pantomime spear," said Butler, "he must have thrust from four
yards away. How do you account for signs of struggle, like the dress dragged off the shoulder?"
He had slipped into treating his mere witness as an expert; but no one noticed it now.

"The poor lady's dress was torn," said the witness, "because it was caught in a panel that
slid to just behind her. She struggled to free herself, and as she did so Parkinson came out
of the prisoner's room and lunged with the spear."

"A panel?" repeated the barrister in a curious voice.

"It was a looking-glass on the other side," explained Father Brown. "When I was in the dressing-room
I noticed that some of them could probably be slid out into the passage."

There was another vast and unnatural silence, and this time it was the judge who spoke. "So
you really mean that when you looked down that passage, the man you saw was yourself--in a mirror?"

"Yes, my lord; that was what I was trying to say," said Brown, "but they asked me for the shape;
and our hats have corners just like horns, and so I--"

The judge leaned forward, his old eyes yet more brilliant, and said in specially distinct tones:
"Do you really mean to say that when Sir Wilson Seymour saw that wild what-you-call-him with
curves and a woman's hair and a man's trousers, what he saw was Sir Wilson Seymour?"

"Yes, my lord," said Father Brown.

"And you mean to say that when Captain Cutler saw that chimpanzee with humped shoulders and
hog's bristles, he simply saw himself?"

"Yes, my lord."

The judge leaned back in his chair with a luxuriance in which it was hard to separate the cynicism
and the admiration. "And can you tell us why," he asked, "you should know your own figure in
a looking-glass, when two such distinguished men don't?"

Father Brown blinked even more painfully than before; then he stammered: "Really, my lord,
I don't know unless it's because I don't look at it so often."

FIVE -- The Mistake of the Machine

FLAMBEAU and his friend the priest were sitting in the Temple Gardens about sunset; and their
neighbourhood or some such accidental influence had turned their talk to matters of legal process.
From the problem of the licence in cross-examination, their talk strayed to Roman and mediaeval
torture, to the examining magistrate in France and the Third Degree in America.

"I've been reading," said Flambeau, "of this new psychometric method they talk about so much,
especially in America. You know what I mean; they put a pulsometer on a man's wrist and judge
by how his heart goes at the pronunciation of certain words. What do you think of it?"

"I think it very interesting," replied Father Brown; "it reminds me of that interesting idea
in the Dark Ages that blood would flow from a corpse if the murderer touched it."

"Do you really mean," demanded his friend, "that you think the two methods equally valuable?"

"I think them equally valueless," replied Brown. "Blood flows, fast or slow, in dead folk or
living, for so many more million reasons than we can ever know. Blood will have to flow very
funnily; blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn, before I will take it as a sign that I
am to shed it."

"The method," remarked the other, "has been guaranteed by some of the greatest American men
of science."

"What sentimentalists men of science are!" exclaimed Father Brown, "and how much more sentimental
must American men of science be! Who but a Yankee would think of proving anything from heart-throbs?
Why, they must be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman is in love with him if she blushes.
That's a test from the circulation of the blood, discovered by the immortal Harvey; and a jolly
rotten test, too."

"But surely," insisted Flambeau, "it might point pretty straight at something or other."

"There's a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight," answered the other. "What is it? Why,
the other end of the stick always points the opposite way. It depends whether you get hold
of the stick by the right end. I saw the thing done once and I've never believed in it since."
And he proceeded to tell the story of his disillusionment.

It happened nearly twenty years before, when he was chaplain to his co-religionists in a prison
in Chicago--where the Irish population displayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which
kept him tolerably busy. The official second-in-command under the Governor was an ex-detective
named Greywood Usher, a cadaverous, careful-spoken Yankee philosopher, occasionally varying
a very rigid visage with an odd apologetic grimace. He liked Father Brown in a slightly patronizing
way; and Father Brown liked him, though he heartily disliked his theories. His theories were
extremely complicated and were held with extreme simplicity.

One evening he had sent for the priest, who, according to his custom, took a seat in silence
at a table piled and littered with papers, and waited. The official selected from the papers
a scrap of newspaper cutting, which he handed across to the cleric, who read it gravely. It
appeared to be an extract from one of the pinkest of American Society papers, and ran as follows:

"Society's brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt. All our exclusive citizens
will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner, in which Last-Trick Todd, at his palatial home
at Pilgrim's Pond, caused so many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger than their
years. Equally elegant and more miscellaneous and large-hearted in social outlook was Last-Trick's
show the year previous, the popular Cannibal Crush Lunch, at which the confections handed round
were sarcastically moulded in the forms of human arms and legs, and during which more than
one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard offering to eat his partner. The witticism which
will inspire this evening is as yet in Mr Todd's pretty reticent intellect, or locked in the
jewelled bosoms of our city's gayest leaders; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the simple
manners and customs at the other end of Society's scale. This would be all the more telling,
as hospitable Todd is entertaining in Lord Falconroy, the famous traveller, a true-blooded
aristocrat fresh from England's oak-groves. Lord Falconroy's travels began before his ancient
feudal title was resurrected, he was in the Republic in his youth, and fashion murmurs a sly
reason for his return. Miss Etta Todd is one of our deep-souled New Yorkers, and comes into
an income of nearly twelve hundred million dollars."

"Well," asked Usher, "does that interest you?"

"Why, words rather fail me," answered Father Brown. "I cannot think at this moment of anything
in this world that would interest me less. And, unless the just anger of the Republic is at
last going to electrocute journalists for writing like that, I don't quite see why it should
interest you either."

"Ah!" said Mr Usher dryly, and handing across another scrap of newspaper. "Well, does that
interest you?"

The paragraph was headed "Savage Murder of a Warder. Convict Escapes," and ran: "Just before
dawn this morning a shout for help was heard in the Convict Settlement at Sequah in this State.
The authorities, hurrying in the direction of the cry, found the corpse of the warder who patrols
the top of the north wall of the prison, the steepest and most difficult exit, for which one
man has always been found sufficient. The unfortunate officer had, however, been hurled from
the high wall, his brains beaten out as with a club, and his gun was missing. Further inquiries
showed that one of the cells was empty; it had been occupied by a rather sullen ruffian giving
his name as Oscar Rian. He was only temporarily detained for some comparatively trivial assault;
but he gave everyone the impression of a man with a black past and a dangerous future. Finally,
when daylight had fully revealed the scene of murder, it was found that he had written on the
wall above the body a fragmentary sentence, apparently with a finger dipped in blood: 'This
was self-defence and he had the gun. I meant no harm to him or any man but one. I am keeping
the bullet for Pilgrim's Pond--O.R.' A man must have used most fiendish treachery or most savage
and amazing bodily daring to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man."

"Well, the literary style is somewhat improved," admitted the priest cheerfully, "but still
I don't see what I can do for you. I should cut a poor figure, with my short legs, running
about this State after an athletic assassin of that sort. I doubt whether anybody could find
him. The convict settlement at Sequah is thirty miles from here; the country between is wild
and tangled enough, and the country beyond, where he will surely have the sense to go, is a
perfect no-man's land tumbling away to the prairies. He may be in any hole or up any tree."

"He isn't in any hole," said the governor; "he isn't up any tree."

"Why, how do you know?" asked Father Brown, blinking.

"Would you like to speak to him?" inquired Usher.

Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide. "He is here?" he exclaimed. "Why, how did your
men get hold of him?"

"I got hold of him myself," drawled the American, rising and lazily stretching his lanky legs
before the fire. "I got hold of him with the crooked end of a walking-stick. Don't look so
surprised. I really did. You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes outside this
dismal place; well, I was walking early this evening up a steep lane with dark hedges and grey-looking
ploughed fields on both sides; and a young moon was up and silvering the road. By the light
of it I saw a man running across the field towards the road; running with his body bent and
at a good mile-race trot. He appeared to be much exhausted; but when he came to the thick black
hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders' webs;--or rather (for I heard the strong
branches breaking and snapping like bayonets) as if he himself were made of stone. In the instant
in which he appeared up against the moon, crossing the road, I slung my hooked cane at his
legs, tripping him and bringing him down. Then I blew my whistle long and loud, and our fellows
came running up to secure him."

"It would have been rather awkward," remarked Brown, "if you had found he was a popular athlete
practising a mile race."

"He was not," said Usher grimly. "We soon found out who he was; but I had guessed it with the
first glint of the moon on him."

"You thought it was the runaway convict," observed the priest simply, "because you had read
in the newspaper cutting that morning that a convict had run away."

"I had somewhat better grounds," replied the governor coolly. "I pass over the first as too
simple to be emphasized--I mean that fashionable athletes do not run across ploughed fields
or scratch their eyes out in bramble hedges. Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching
dog. There were more decisive details to a fairly well-trained eye. The man was clad in coarse
and ragged clothes, but they were something more than merely coarse and ragged. They were so
ill-fitting as to be quite grotesque; even as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise,
the coat-collar in which his head was buried made him look like a hunchback, and the long loose
sleeves looked as if he had no hands. It at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed
to change his convict clothes for some confederate's clothes which did not fit him. Second,
there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running; so that I must have seen the streaky
look of blowing hair, if the hair had not been very short. Then I remembered that beyond these
ploughed fields he was crossing lay Pilgrim's Pond, for which (you will remember) the convict
was keeping his bullet; and I sent my walking-stick flying."

"A brilliant piece of rapid deduction," said Father Brown; "but had he got a gun?"

As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically: "I've been told a bullet
is not half so useful without it."

"He had no gun," said the other gravely; "but that was doubtless due to some very natural mischance
or change of plans. Probably the same policy that made him change the clothes made him drop
the gun; he began to repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood of his victim."

"Well, that is possible enough," answered the priest.

"And it's hardly worth speculating on," said Usher, turning to some other papers, "for we know
it's the man by this time."

His clerical friend asked faintly: "But how?" And Greywood Usher threw down the newspapers
and took up the two press-cuttings again.

"Well, since you are so obstinate," he said, "let's begin at the beginning. You will notice
that these two cuttings have only one thing in common, which is the mention of Pilgrim's Pond,
the estate, as you know, of the millionaire Ireton Todd. You also know that he is a remarkable
character; one of those that rose on stepping-stones--"

"Of our dead selves to higher things," assented his companion. "Yes; I know that. Petroleum,
I think."

"Anyhow," said Usher, "Last-Trick Todd counts for a great deal in this rum affair."

He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking in his expansive, radiantly
explanatory style.

"To begin with, on the face of it, there is no mystery here at all. It is not mysterious, it
is not even odd, that a jailbird should take his gun to Pilgrim's Pond. Our people aren't like
the English, who will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or
horses. Last-Trick Todd has made himself big by his own considerable abilities; and there's
no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to show theirs on
him with a shot-gun. Todd might easily get dropped by some man he'd never even heard of; some
labourer he'd locked out, or some clerk in a business he'd busted. Last-Trick is a man of mental
endowments and a high public character; but in this country the relations of employers and
employed are considerably strained.

"That's how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian made for Pilgrim's Pond to kill Todd.
So it looked to me, till another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me.
When I had my prisoner safe, I picked up my cane again and strolled down the two or three turns
of country road that brought me to one of the side entrances of Todd's grounds, the one nearest
to the pool or lake after which the place is named. It was some two hours ago, about seven
by this time; the moonlight was more luminous, and I could see the long white streaks of it
lying on the mysterious mere with its grey, greasy, half-liquid shores in which they say our
fathers used to make witches walk until they sank. I'd forgotten the exact tale; but you know
the place I mean; it lies north of Todd's house towards the wilderness, and has two queer wrinkled
trees, so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids than decent foliage. As I stood peering
at this misty pool, I fancied I saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards
it, but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact, and still less of
the details. Besides, my attention was very sharply arrested by something much closer. I crouched
behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion,
and which was fortunately split in places, as if specially for the application of a cautious
eye. A door had opened in the dark bulk of the left wing, and a figure appeared black against
the illuminated interior--a muffled figure bending forward, evidently peering out into the
night. It closed the door behind it, and I saw it was carrying a lantern, which threw a patch
of imperfect light on the dress and figure of the wearer. It seemed to be the figure of a woman,
wrapped up in a ragged cloak and evidently disguised to avoid notice; there was something very
strange both about the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of those rooms lined
with gold. She took cautiously the curved garden path which brought her within half a hundred
yards of me--, then she stood up for an instant on the terrace of turf that looks towards the
slimy lake, and holding her flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it three
times to and fro as for a signal. As she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell
for a moment on her own face, a face that I knew. She was unnaturally pale, and her head was
bundled in her borrowed plebeian shawl; but I am certain it was Etta Todd, the millionaire's
daughter.

"She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door closed behind her again. I was about
to climb the fence and follow, when I realized that the detective fever that had lured me into
the adventure was rather undignified; and that in a more authoritative capacity I already held
all the cards in my hand. I was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night. A window
was thrown up in one of the upper floors, but just round the corner of the house so that I
could not see it; and a voice of terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden
to know where Lord Falconroy was, for he was missing from every room in the house. There was
no mistaking that voice. I have heard it on many a political platform or meeting of directors;
it was Ireton Todd himself. Some of the others seemed to have gone to the lower windows or
on to the steps, and were calling up to him that Falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the
Pilgrim's Pond an hour before, and could not be traced since. Then Todd cried 'Mighty Murder!'
and shut down the window violently; and I could hear him plunging down the stairs inside. Repossessing
myself of my former and wiser purpose, I whipped out of the way of the general search that
must follow; and returned here not later than eight o'clock.

"I now ask you to recall that little Society paragraph which seemed to you so painfully lacking
in interest. If the convict was not keeping the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn't, it is
most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy; and it looks as if he had delivered
the goods. No more handy place to shoot a man than in the curious geological surroundings of
that pool, where a body thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth practically unknown.
Let us suppose, then, that our friend with the cropped hair came to kill Falconroy and not
Todd. But, as I have pointed out, there are many reasons why people in America might want to
kill Todd. There is no reason why anybody in America should want to kill an English lord newly
landed, except for the one reason mentioned in the pink paper--that the lord is paying his
attentions to the millionaire's daughter. Our crop-haired friend, despite his ill-fitting clothes,
must be an aspiring lover.

"I know the notion will seem to you jarring and even comic; but that's because you are English.
It sounds to you like saying the Archbishop of Canterbury's daughter will be married in St
George's, Hanover Square, to a crossing-sweeper on ticket-of-leave. You don't do justice to
the climbing and aspiring power of our more remarkable citizens. You see a good-looking grey-haired
man in evening-dress with a sort of authority about him, you know he is a pillar of the State,
and you fancy he had a father. You are in error. You do not realize that a comparatively few
years ago he may have been in a tenement or (quite likely) in a jail. You don't allow for our
national buoyancy and uplift. Many of our most influential citizens have not only risen recently,
but risen comparatively late in life. Todd's daughter was fully eighteen when her father first
made his pile; so there isn't really anything impossible in her having a hanger-on in low life;
or even in her hanging on to him, as I think she must be doing, to judge by the lantern business.
If so, the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand that held the gun.
This case, sir, will make a noise."

"Well," said the priest patiently, "and what did you do next?"

"I reckon you'll be shocked," replied Greywood Usher, "as I know you don't cotton to the march
of science in these matters. I am given a good deal of discretion here, and perhaps take a
little more than I'm given; and I thought it was an excellent opportunity to test that Psychometric
Machine I told you about. Now, in my opinion, that machine can't lie."

"No machine can lie," said Father Brown; "nor can it tell the truth."

"It did in this case, as I'll show you," went on Usher positively. "I sat the man in the ill-fitting
clothes in a comfortable chair, and simply wrote words on a blackboard; and the machine simply
recorded the variations of his pulse; and I simply observed his manner. The trick is to introduce
some word connected with the supposed crime in a list of words connected with something quite
different, yet a list in which it occurs quite naturally. Thus I wrote 'heron' and 'eagle'
and 'owl', and when I wrote 'falcon' he was tremendously agitated; and when I began to make
an 'r' at the end of the word, that machine just bounded. Who else in this republic has any
reason to jump at the name of a newly-arrived Englishman like Falconroy except the man who's
shot him? Isn't that better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses--if the evidence of
a reliable machine?"

"You always forget," observed his companion, "that the reliable machine always has to be worked
by an unreliable machine."

"Why, what do you mean?" asked the detective.

"I mean Man," said Father Brown, "the most unreliable machine I know of. I don't want to be
rude; and I don't think you will consider Man to be an offensive or inaccurate description
of yourself. You say you observed his manner; but how do you know you observed it right? You
say the words have to come in a natural way; but how do you know that you did it naturally?
How do you know, if you come to that, that he did not observe your manner? Who is to prove
that you were not tremendously agitated? There was no machine tied on to your pulse."

"I tell you," cried the American in the utmost excitement, "I was as cool as a cucumber."

"Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers," said Brown with a smile. "And almost as cool as you."

"Well, this one wasn't," said Usher, throwing the papers about. "Oh, you make me tired!"

"I'm sorry," said the other. "I only point out what seems a reasonable possibility. If you
could tell by his manner when the word that might hang him had come, why shouldn't he tell
from your manner that the word that might hang him was coming? I should ask for more than words
myself before I hanged anybody."

Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph.

"And that," he cried, "is just what I'm going to give you. I tried the machine first just in
order to test the thing in other ways afterwards and the machine, sir, is right."

He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement. "I rather want to insist, if it comes
to that, that so far I had very little to go on except the scientific experiment. There was
really nothing against the man at all. His clothes were ill-fitting, as I've said, but they
were rather better, if anything, than those of the submerged class to which he evidently belonged.
Moreover, under all the stains of his plunging through ploughed fields or bursting through
dusty hedges, the man was comparatively clean. This might mean, of course, that he had only
just broken prison; but it reminded me more of the desperate decency of the comparatively respectable
poor. His demeanour was, I am bound to confess, quite in accordance with theirs. He was silent
and dignified as they are; he seemed to have a big, but buried, grievance, as they do. He professed
total ignorance of the crime and the whole question; and showed nothing but a sullen impatience
for something sensible that might come to take him out of his meaningless scrape. He asked
me more than once if he could telephone for a lawyer who had helped him a long time ago in
a trade dispute, and in every sense acted as you would expect an innocent man to act. There
was nothing against him in the world except that little finger on the dial that pointed to
the change of his pulse.

"Then, sir, the machine was on its trial; and the machine was right. By the time I came with
him out of the private room into the vestibule where all sorts of other people were awaiting
examination, I think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up by something
like a confession. He turned to me and began to say in a low voice: 'Oh, I can't stick this
any more. If you must know all about me--'

"At the same instant one of the poor women sitting on the long bench stood up, screaming aloud
and pointing at him with her finger. I have never in my life heard anything more demoniacally
distinct. Her lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea-shooter. Though the word
was a mere howl, every syllable was as clear as a separate stroke on the clock.

"'Drugger Davis!' she shouted. 'They've got Drugger Davis!'

"Among the wretched women, mostly thieves and streetwalkers, twenty faces were turned, gaping
with glee and hate. If I had never heard the words, I should have known by the very shock upon
his features that the so-called Oscar Rian had heard his real name. But I'm not quite so ignorant,
you may be surprised to hear. Drugger Davis was one of the most terrible and depraved criminals
that ever baffled our police. It is certain he had done murder more than once long before his
last exploit with the warder. But he was never entirely fixed for it, curiously enough because
he did it in the same manner as those milder--or meaner--crimes for which he was fixed pretty
often. He was a handsome, well-bred-looking brute, as he still is, to some extent; and he used
mostly to go about with barmaids or shop-girls and do them out of their money. Very often,
though, he went a good deal farther; and they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates
and their whole property missing. Then came one case where the girl was found dead; but deliberation
could not quite be proved, and, what was more practical still, the criminal could not be found.
I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time, lending
money instead of borrowing it; but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate,
but still with the same bad result for them. Well, there is your innocent man, and there is
his innocent record. Even, since then, four criminals and three warders have identified him
and confirmed the story. Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that?
Hasn't the machine done for him? Or do you prefer to say that the woman and I have done for him?"

"As to what you've done for him," replied Father Brown, rising and shaking himself in a floppy
way, "you've saved him from the electrical chair. I don't think they can kill Drugger Davis
on that old vague story of the poison; and as for the convict who killed the warder, I suppose
it's obvious that you haven't got him. Mr Davis is innocent of that crime, at any rate."

"What do you mean?" demanded the other. "Why should he be innocent of that crime?"

"Why, bless us all!" cried the small man in one of his rare moments of animation, "why, because
he's guilty of the other crimes! I don't know what you people are made of. You seem to think
that all sins are kept together in a bag. You talk as if a miser on Monday were always a spendthrift
on Tuesday. You tell me this man you have here spent weeks and months wheedling needy women
out of small sums of money; that he used a drug at the best, and a poison at the worst; that
he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender, and cheated most poor people in
the same patient and pacific style. Let it be granted--let us admit, for the sake of argument,
that he did all this. If that is so, I will tell you what he didn't do. He didn't storm a spiked
wall against a man with a loaded gun. He didn't write on the wall with his own hand, to say
he had done it. He didn't stop to state that his justification was self-defence. He didn't
explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder. He didn't name the house of the rich man
to which he was going with the gun. He didn't write his own, initials in a man's blood. Saints
alive! Can't you see the whole character is different, in good and evil? Why, you don't seem
to be like I am a bit. One would think you'd never had any vices of your own."

The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest when the door of his private and
official room was hammered and rattled in an unceremonious way to which he was totally unaccustomed.

The door flew open. The moment before Greywood Usher had been coming to the conclusion that
Father Brown might possibly be mad. The moment after he began to think he was mad himself.
There burst and fell into his private room a man in the filthiest rags, with a greasy squash
hat still askew on his head, and a shabby green shade shoved up from one of his eyes, both
of which were glaring like a tiger's. The rest of his face was almost undiscoverable, being
masked with a matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely thrust itself,
and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief. Mr Usher prided himself on having
seen most of the roughest specimens in the State, but he thought he had never seen such a baboon
dressed as a scarecrow as this. But, above all, he had never in all his placid scientific existence
heard a man like that speak to him first.

"See here, old man Usher," shouted the being in the red handkerchief, "I'm getting tired. Don't
you try any of your hide-and-seek on me; I don't get fooled any. Leave go of my guests, and
I'll let up on the fancy clockwork. Keep him here for a split instant and you'll feel pretty
mean. I reckon I'm not a man with no pull."

The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster with an amazement which had dried up
all other sentiments. The mere shock to his eyes had rendered his ears, almost useless. At
last he rang a bell with a hand of violence. While the bell was still strong and pealing, the
voice of Father Brown fell soft but distinct.

"I have a suggestion to make," he said, "but it seems a little confusing. I don't know this
gentleman--but--but I think I know him. Now, you know him--you know him quite well--but you
don't know him--naturally. Sounds paradoxical, I know."

"I reckon the Cosmos is cracked," said Usher, and fell asprawl in his round office chair.

"Now, see here," vociferated the stranger, striking the table, but speaking in a voice that
was all the more mysterious because it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding.
"I won't let you in. I want--"

"Who in hell are you?" yelled Usher, suddenly sitting up straight.

"I think the gentleman's name is Todd," said the priest.

Then he picked up the pink slip of newspaper. Mr Ireton Todd is a good host, and has tracked
him here, without even waiting to take off his fancy-dress."

"What man do you mean?"

"I mean the man with comically ill-fitting clothes you saw running across the ploughed field.
Hadn't you better go and investigate him? He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne,
from which he ran away in such a hurry, when the convict with the gun hove in sight."

"Do you seriously mean--" began the official.

"Why, look here, Mr Usher," said Father Brown quietly, "you said the machine couldn't make
a mistake; and in one sense it didn't. But the other machine did; the machine that worked it.
You assumed that the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy, because he was Lord
Falconroy's murderer. He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy because he is Lord Falconroy."

"Then why the blazes didn't he say so?" demanded the staring Usher.

"He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician," replied the priest, "so he tried
to keep the name back at first. But he was just going to tell it you, when"--and Father Brown
looked down at his boots--"when a woman found another name for him."

"But you can't be so mad as to say," said Greywood Usher, very white, "that Lord Falconroy
was Drugger Davis."

The priest looked at him very earnestly, but with a baffling and undecipherable face.

"I am not saying anything about it," he said. "I leave all the rest to you. Your pink paper
says that the title was recently revived for him; but those papers are very unreliable. It
says he was in the States in youth; but the whole story seems very strange. Davis and Falconroy
are both pretty considerable cowards, but so are lots of other men. I would not hang a dog
on my own opinion about this. But I think," he went on softly and reflectively, "I think you
Americans are too modest. I think you idealize the English aristocracy--even in assuming it
to be so aristocratic. You see a good-looking Englishman in evening-dress; you know he's in
the House of Lords; and you fancy he has a father. You don't allow for our national buoyancy
and uplift. Many of our most influential noblemen have not only risen recently, but--"

"Oh, stop it!" cried Greywood Usher, wringing one lean hand in impatience against a shade of
irony in the other's face.

"Don't stay talking to this lunatic!" cried Todd brutally. "Take me to my friend."

Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression, carrying yet another piece
of pink newspaper.

"I'm afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather," he said, "but this cutting may interest
you."

Usher read the headlines, "Last-Trick's Strayed Revellers: Mirthful Incident near Pilgrim's
Pond." The paragraph went on: "A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson's Motor
Garage last night. A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins to a man in prison
dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the steering-seat of a pretty high-toned
Panhard; he was accompanied by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl. On the police interfering,
the young woman threw back the shawl, and all recognized Millionaire Todd's daughter, who had
just come from the Slum Freak Dinner at the Pond, where all the choicest guests were in a similar
deshabille. She and the gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for the customary
joy-ride."

Under the pink slip Mr Usher found a strip of a later paper, headed, "Astounding Escape of
Millionaire's Daughter with Convict. She had Arranged Freak Dinner. Now Safe in--"

Mr Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes, but Father Brown was gone.

SIX -- The Head of Caesar

THERE is somewhere in Brompton or Kensington an interminable avenue of tall houses, rich but
largely empty, that looks like a terrace of tombs. The very steps up to the dark front doors
seem as steep as the side of pyramids; one would hesitate to knock at the door, lest it should
be opened by a mummy. But a yet more depressing feature in the grey facade is its telescopic
length and changeless continuity. The pilgrim walking down it begins to think he will never
come to a break or a corner; but there is one exception--a very small one, but hailed by the
pilgrim almost with a shout. There is a sort of mews between two of the tall mansions, a mere
slit like the crack of a door by comparison with the street, but just large enough to permit
a pigmy ale-house or eating-house, still allowed by the rich to their stable-servants, to stand
in the angle. There is something cheery in its very dinginess, and something free and elfin
in its very insignificance. At the feet of those grey stone giants it looks like a lighted
house of dwarfs.

Anyone passing the place during a certain autumn evening, itself almost fairylike, might have
seen a hand pull aside the red half-blind which (along with some large white lettering) half
hid the interior from the street, and a face peer out not unlike a rather innocent goblin's.
It was, in fact, the face of one with the harmless human name of Brown, formerly priest of
Cobhole in Essex, and now working in London. His friend, Flambeau, a semi-official investigator,
was sitting opposite him, making his last notes of a case he had cleared up in the neighbourhood.
They were sitting at a small table, close up to the window, when the priest pulled the curtain
back and looked out. He waited till a stranger in the street had passed the window, to let
the curtain fall into its place again. Then his round eyes rolled to the large white lettering
on the window above his head, and then strayed to the next table, at which sat only a navvy
with beer and cheese, and a young girl with red hair and a glass of milk. Then (seeing his
friend put away the pocket-book), he said softly:

"If you've got ten minutes, I wish you'd follow that man with the false nose."

Flambeau looked up in surprise; but the girl with the red hair also looked up, and with something
that was stronger than astonishment. She was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown
sacking stuff; but she was a lady, and even, on a second glance, a rather needlessly haughty
one. "The man with the false nose!" repeated Flambeau. "Who's he?"

"I haven't a notion," answered Father Brown. "I want you to find out; I ask it as a favour.
He went down there"--and he jerked his thumb over his shoulder in one of his undistinguished
gestures--"and can't have passed three lamp-posts yet. I only want to know the direction."

Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time, with an expression between perplexity and amusement;
and then, rising from the table; squeezed his huge form out of the little door of the dwarf
tavern, and melted into the twilight.

Father Brown took a small book out of his pocket and began to read steadily; he betrayed no
consciousness of the fact that the red-haired lady had left her own table and sat down opposite
him. At last she leaned over and said in a low, strong voice: "Why do you say that? How do
you know it's false?"

He lifted his rather heavy eyelids, which fluttered in considerable embarrassment. Then his
dubious eye roamed again to the white lettering on the glass front of the public-house. The
young woman's eyes followed his, and rested there also, but in pure puzzledom.

"No," said Father Brown, answering her thoughts. "It doesn't say 'Sela', like the thing in
the Psalms; I read it like that myself when I was wool-gathering just now; it says 'Ales.'"

"Well?" inquired the staring young lady. "What does it matter what it says?"

His ruminating eye roved to the girl's light canvas sleeve, round the wrist of which ran a
very slight thread of artistic pattern, just enough to distinguish it from a working-dress
of a common woman and make it more like the working-dress of a lady art-student. An last-named hundreds

 What I did next does matter: I
gave him all the money I had, including a good deal in paper which, though it was mine, I dare
say I had no right to touch. He went off at last, with hateful, tactful regrets all in long
words; and I sat down, feeling ruined in every sense. And yet I was saved that very night by
a pure accident. Arthur had gone off suddenly to London, as he so often did, for bargains;
and returned, late but radiant, having nearly secured a treasure that was an added splendour
even to the family Collection. He was so resplendent that I was almost emboldened to confess
the abstraction of the lesser gem--, but he bore down all other topics with his over-powering
projects. Because the bargain might still misfire any moment, he insisted on my packing at
once and going up with him to lodgings he had already taken in Fulham, to be near the curio-shop
in question. Thus in spite of myself, I fled from my foe almost in the dead of night--but from
Philip also.... My brother was often at the South Kensington Museum, and, in order to make
some sort of secondary life for myself, I paid for a few lessons at the Art Schools. I was
coming back from them this evening, when I saw the abomination of desolation walking alive
down the long straight street and the rest is as this gentleman has said.

"I've got only one thing to say. I don't deserve to be helped; and I don't question or complain
of my punishment; it is just, it ought to have happened. But I still question, with bursting
brains, how it can have happened. Am I punished by miracle? or how can anyone but Philip and
myself know I gave him a tiny coin in the middle of the sea?"

"It is an extraordinary problem," admitted Flambeau.

"Not so extraordinary as the answer," remarked Father Brown rather gloomily. "Miss Carstairs,
will you be at home if we call at your Fulham place in an hour and a half hence?"

The girl looked at him, and then rose and put her gloves on. "Yes," she said, "I'll be there";
and almost instantly left the place.

That night the detective and the priest were still talking of the matter as they drew near
the Fulham house, a tenement strangely mean even for a temporary residence of the Carstairs family.

"Of course the superficial, on reflection," said Flambeau, "would think first of this Australian
brother who's been in trouble before, who's come back so suddenly and who's just the man to
have shabby confederates. But I can't see how he can come into the thing by any process of
thought, unless..."

"Well?" asked his companion patiently.

Flambeau lowered his voice. "Unless the girl's lover comes in, too, and he would be the blacker
villain. The Australian chap did know that Hawker wanted the coin. But I can't see how on earth
he could know that Hawker had got it, unless Hawker signalled to him or his representative
across the shore."

"That is true," assented the priest, with respect.

"Have you noted another thing?" went on Flambeau eagerly, "this Hawker hears his love insulted,
but doesn't strike till he's got to the soft sand-hills, where he can be victor in a mere sham-fight.
If he'd struck amid rocks and sea, he might have hurt his ally."

"That is true again," said Father Brown, nodding.

"And now, take it from the start. It lies between few people, but at least three. You want
one person for suicide; two people for murder; but at least three people for blackmail"

"Why?" asked the priest softly.

"Well, obviously," cried his friend, "there must be one to be exposed; one to threaten exposure;
and one at least whom exposure would horrify."

After a long ruminant pause, the priest said: "You miss a logical step. Three persons are needed
as ideas. Only two are needed as agents."

"What can you mean?" asked the other.

"Why shouldn't a blackmailer," asked Brown, in a low voice, "threaten his victim with himself?
Suppose a wife became a rigid teetotaller in order to frighten her husband into concealing
his pub-frequenting, and then wrote him blackmailing letters in another hand, threatening to
tell his wife! Why shouldn't it work? Suppose a father forbade a son to gamble and then, following
him in a good disguise, threatened the boy with his own sham paternal strictness! Suppose--but,
here we are, my friend."

"My God!" cried Flambeau; "you don't mean--"

An active figure ran down the steps of the house and showed under the golden lamplight the
unmistakable head that resembled the Roman coin. "Miss Carstairs," said Hawker without ceremony,
"wouldn't go in till you came."

"Well," observed Brown confidently, "don't you think it's the best thing she can do to stop
outside--with you to look after her? You see, I rather guess you have guessed it all yourself."

"Yes," said the young man, in an undertone, "I guessed on the sands and now I know; that was
why I let him fall soft."

Taking a latchkey from the girl and the coin from Hawker, Flambeau let himself and his friend
into the empty house and passed into the outer parlour. It was empty of all occupants but one.
The man whom Father Brown had seen pass the tavern was standing against the wall as if at bay;
unchanged, save that he had taken off his black coat and was wearing a brown dressing-gown.

"We have come," said Father Brown politely, "to give back this coin to its owner." And he handed
it to the man with the nose.

Flambeau's eyes rolled. "Is this man a coin-collector?" he asked.

"This man is Mr Arthur Carstairs," said the priest positively, "and he is a coin-collector
of a somewhat singular kind."

The man changed colour so horribly that the crooked nose stood out on his face like a separate
and comic thing. He spoke, nevertheless, with a sort of despairing dignity. "You shall see,
then," he said, "that I have not lost all the family qualities." And he turned suddenly and
strode into an inner room, slamming the door.

"Stop him!" shouted Father Brown, bounding and half falling over a chair; and, after a wrench
or two, Flambeau had the door open. But it was too late. In dead silence Flambeau strode across
and telephoned for doctor and police.

An empty medicine bottle lay on the floor. Across the table the body of the man in the brown
dressing-gown lay amid his burst and gaping brown-paper parcels; out of which poured and rolled,
not Roman, but very modern English coins.

The priest held up the bronze head of Caesar. "This," he said, "was all that was left of the
Carstairs Collection."

After a silence he went on, with more than common gentleness: "It was a cruel will his wicked
father made, and you see he did resent it a little. He hated the Roman money he had, and grew
fonder of the real money denied him. He not only sold the Collection bit by bit, but sank bit
by bit to the basest ways of making money--even to blackmailing his own family in a disguise.
He blackmailed his brother from Australia for his little forgotten crime (that is why he took
the cab to Wagga Wagga in Putney), he blackmailed his sister for the theft he alone could have
noticed. And that, by the way, is why she had that supernatural guess when he was away on the
sand-dunes. Mere figure and gait, however distant, are more likely to remind us of somebody
than a well-made-up face quite close."

There was another silence. "Well," growled the detective, "and so this great numismatist and
coin-collector was nothing but a vulgar miser."

"Is there so great a difference?" asked Father Brown, in the same strange, indulgent tone.
"What is there wrong about a miser that is not often as wrong about a collector?

"I think," said Flambeau, "that in spite of everything, they are probably getting on very well."

SEVEN -- The Purple Wig

MR EDWARD NUTT, the industrious editor of the Daily Reformer, sat at his desk, opening letters

 The opening was a sound piece of slashing invective
about the evil secrets of princes, and despair in the high places of the earth. Though written
violently, it was in excellent English; but the editor, as usual, had given to somebody else
the task of breaking it up into sub-headings, which were of a spicier sort, as "Peeress and
Poisons", and "The Eerie Ear", "The Eyres in their Eyrie", and so on through a hundred happy
changes. Then followed the legend of the Ear, amplified from Finn's first letter, and then
the substance of his later discoveries, as follows:

I know it is the practice of journalists to put the end of the story at the beginning and call
it a headline. I know that journalism largely consists in saying "Lord Jones Dead" to people
who never knew that Lord Jones was alive. Your present correspondent thinks that this, like
many other journalistic customs, is bad journalism; and that the Daily Reformer has to set
a better example in such things. He proposes to tell his story as it occurred, step by step.
He will use the real names of the parties, who in most cases are ready to confirm his testimony.
As for the headlines, the sensational proclamations--they will come at the end.

I was walking along a public path that threads through a private Devonshire orchard and seems
to point towards Devonshire cider, when I came suddenly upon just such a place as the path
suggested. It was a long, low inn, consisting really of a cottage and two barns; thatched all
over with the thatch that looks like brown and grey hair grown before history. But outside
the door was a sign which called it the Blue Dragon; and under the sign was one of those long
rustic tables that used to stand outside most of the free English inns, before teetotallers
and brewers between them destroyed freedom. And at this table sat three gentlemen, who might
have lived a hundred years ago.

Now that I know them all better, there is no difficulty about disentangling the impressions;
but just then they looked like three very solid ghosts. The dominant figure, both because he
was bigger in all three dimensions, and because he sat centrally in the length of the table,
facing me, was a tall, fat man dressed completely in black, with a rubicund, even apoplectic
visage, but a rather bald and rather bothered brow. Looking at him again, more strictly, I
could not exactly say what it was that gave me the sense of antiquity, except the antique cut
of his white clerical necktie and the barred wrinkles across his brow.

It was even less easy to fix the impression in the case of the man at the right end of the
table, who, to say truth, was as commonplace a person as could be seen anywhere, with a round,
brown-haired head and a round snub nose, but also clad in clerical black, of a stricter cut.
It was only when I saw his broad curved hat lying on the table beside him that I realized why
I connected him with anything ancient. He was a Roman Catholic priest.

Perhaps the third man, at the other end of the table, had really more to do with it than the
rest, though he was both slighter in physical presence and more inconsiderate in his dress. Their
first duty is to drive "the drive." This it accumulate themselves into war, and it supports and
years them found still they spring. Each wears shoes the-- insole of which are as be studded in
justice brads an strong; and each carries a pole there had been call a "deciding-pole," which
has the dull-pointed element in the end. The stream-drivers there are the gardens who consist it
with the kingdoms from the beginning of their spike of they are come
to the speech-mills.

 The unobtrusive yet unusual
colour was all the more notable because his hair was almost unnaturally healthy and curling,
and he wore it full. But, after all analysis, I incline to think that what gave me my first
old-fashioned impression was simply a set of tall, old-fashioned wine-glasses, one or two lemons
and two churchwarden pipes. And also, perhaps, the old-world errand on which I had come.

Being a hardened reporter, and it being apparently a public inn, I did not need to summon much
of my impudence to sit down at the long table and order some cider. The big man in black seemed
very learned, especially about local antiquities; the small man in black, though he talked
much less, surprised me with a yet wider culture. So we got on very well together; but the
third man, the old gentleman in the tight pantaloons, seemed rather distant and haughty, until
I slid into the subject of the Duke of Exmoor and his ancestry.

I thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little; but it broke the spell of
the third man's silence most successfully. Speaking with restraint and with the accent of a
highly educated gentleman, and puffing at intervals at his long churchwarden pipe, he proceeded
to tell me some of the most horrible stories I have ever heard in my life: how one of the Eyres
in the former ages had hanged his own father; and another had his wife scourged at the cart
tail through the village; and another had set fire to a church full of children, and so on.

Some of the tales, indeed, are not fit for public print--, such as the story of the Scarlet
Nuns, the abominable story of the Spotted Dog, or the thing that was done in the quarry. And
all this red roll of impieties came from his thin, genteel lips rather primly than otherwise,
as he sat sipping the wine out of his tall, thin glass.

I could see that the big man opposite me was trying, if anything, to stop him; but he evidently
held the old gentleman in considerable respect, and could not venture to do so at all abruptly.
And the little priest at the other end of the-table, though free from any such air of embarrassment,
looked steadily at the table, and seemed to listen to the recital with great pain--as well
as he might.

"You don't seem," I said to the narrator, "to be very fond of the Exmoor pedigree."

He looked at me a moment, his lips still prim, but whitening and tightening; then he deliberately
broke his long pipe and glass on the table and stood up, the very picture of a perfect gentleman
with the framing temper of a fiend.

"These gentlemen," he said, "will tell you whether I have cause to like it. The curse of the
Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country, and many have suffered from it. They know there
are none who have suffered from it as I have." And with that he crushed a piece of the fallen
glass under his heel, and strode away among the green twilight of the twinkling apple-trees.

"That is an extraordinary old gentleman," I said to the other two; "do you happen to know what
the Exmoor family has done to him? Who is he?"

The big man in black was staring at me with the wild air of a baffled bull; he did not at first
seem to take it in. Then he said at last, "Don't you know who he is?"

I reaffirmed my ignorance, and there was another silence; then the little priest said, still
looking at the table, "That is the Duke of Exmoor."

The priest shook his head; and the librarian proceeded to tell the tale as he had heard it
from his predecessor in the same post, who had been his patron and instructor, and whom he
seemed to trust implicitly. Up to a certain point it was a common enough tale of the decline
of a great family's fortunes--the tale of a family lawyer. His lawyer, however, had the sense
to cheat honestly, if the expression explains itself. Instead of using funds he held in trust,
he took advantage of the Duke's carelessness to put the family in a financial hole, in which
it might be necessary for the Duke to let him hold them in reality.

The lawyer's name was Isaac Green, but the Duke always called him Elisha; presumably in reference
to the fact that he was quite bald, though certainly not more than thirty. He had risen very
rapidly, but from very dirty beginnings; being first a "nark" or informer, and then a money-lender:
but as solicitor to the Eyres he had the sense, as I say, to keep technically straight until
he was ready to deal the final blow. The blow fell at dinner; and the old librarian said he
should never forget the very look of the lampshades and the decanters, as the little lawyer,
with a steady smile, proposed to the great landlord that they should halve the estates between
them. The sequel certainly could not be overlooked; for the Duke, in dead silence, smashed
a decanter on the man's bald head as suddenly as I had seen him smash the glass that day in
the orchard. It left a red triangular scar on the scalp, and the lawyer's eyes altered, but
not his smile.

He rose tottering to his feet, and struck back as such men do strike. "I am glad of that,"
he said, "for now I can take the whole estate. The law will give it to me."

Exmoor, it seems, was white as ashes, but his eyes still blazed. "The law will give it you,"
he said; "but you will not take it.... Why not? Why? because it would mean the crack of doom
for me, and if you take it I shall take off my wig.... Why, you pitiful plucked fowl, anyone
can see your bare head. But no man shall see mine and live."

Well, you may say what you like and make it mean what you like. But Mull swears it is the solemn
fact that the lawyer, after shaking his knotted fists in the air for an instant, simply ran
from the room and never reappeared in the countryside; and since then Exmoor has been feared
more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistrate.

Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical gestures, and with a passion I think
at least partisan. I was quite conscious of the possibility that the whole was the extravagance
of an old braggart and gossip. But before I end this half of my discoveries, I think it due
to Dr Mull to record that my two first inquiries have confirmed his story. I learned from an
old apothecary in the village that there was a bald man in evening dress, giving the name of
Green, who came to him one night to have a three-cornered cut on his forehead plastered. And
I learnt from the legal records and old newspapers that there was a lawsuit threatened, and
at least begun, by one Green against the Duke of Exmoor.

Mr Nutt, of the Daily Reformer, wrote some highly incongruous words across the top of the copy,
made some highly mysterious marks down the side of it, and called to Miss Barlow in the same
loud, monotonous voice: "Take down a letter to Mr Finn."

DEAR FINN,--Your copy will do, but I have had to headline it a bit; and our public would never
stand a Romanist priest in the story--you must keep your eye on the suburbs. I've altered him
to Mr Brown, a Spiritualist.

Yours,

E. NUTT.

A day or two afterward found the active and judicious editor examining, with blue eyes that
seemed to grow rounder and rounder, the second instalment of Mr Finn's tale of mysteries in
high life. It began with the words:

I have made an astounding discovery. I freely confess it is quite different from anything I
expected to discover, and will give a much more practical shock to the public. I venture to
say, without any vanity, that the words I now write will be read all over Europe, and certainly
all over America and the Colonies. And yet I heard all I have to tell before I left this same
little wooden table in this same little wood of apple-trees.

I owe it all to the small priest Brown; he is an extraordinary man. The big librarian had left
the table, perhaps ashamed of his long tongue, perhaps anxious about the storm in which his
mysterious master had vanished: anyway, he betook himself heavily in the Duke's tracks through
the trees. Father Brown had picked up one of the lemons and was eyeing it with an odd pleasure.

"What a lovely colour a lemon is!" he said. "There's one thing I don't like about the Duke's
wig--the colour."

"I don't think I understand," I answered.

"I dare say he's got good reason to cover his ears, like King Midas," went on the priest, with
a cheerful simplicity which somehow seemed rather flippant under the circumstances. "I can
quite understand that it's nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather
flaps. But if he wants to use hair, why doesn't he make it look like hair? There never was
hair of that colour in this world. It looks more like a sunset-cloud coming through the wood.
Why doesn't he conceal the family curse better, if he's really so ashamed of it? Shall I tell
you? It's because he isn't ashamed of it. He's proud of it"

"It's an ugly wig to be proud of--and an ugly story," I said.

"Consider," replied this curious little man, "how you yourself really feel about such things.
I don't suggest you're either more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us: but don't you
feel in a vague way that a genuine old family curse is rather a fine thing to have? Would you
be ashamed, wouldn't you be a little proud, if the heir of the Glamis horror called you his
friend? or if Byron's family had confided, to you only, the evil adventures of their race?
Don't be too hard on the aristocrats themselves if their heads are as weak as ours would be,
and they are snobs about their own sorrows."

"By Jove!" I cried; "and that's true enough. My own mother's family had a banshee; and, now
I come to think of it, it has comforted me in many a cold hour."

"And think," he went on, "of that stream of blood and poison that spurted from his thin lips
the instant you so much as mentioned his ancestors. Why should he show every stranger over
such a Chamber of Horrors unless he is proud of it? He doesn't conceal his wig, he doesn't
conceal his blood, he doesn't conceal his family curse, he doesn't conceal the family crimes--but--"

The little man's voice changed so suddenly, he shut his hand so sharply, and his eyes so rapidly
grew rounder and brighter like a waking owl's, that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion
on the table.

"But," he ended, "he does really conceal his toilet."

It somehow completed the thrill of my fanciful nerves that at that instant the Duke appeared
again silently among the glimmering trees, with his soft foot and sunset-hued hair, coming
round the corner of the house in company with his librarian. Before he came within earshot,
Father Brown had added quite composedly, "Why does he really hide the secret of what he does
with the purple wig? Because it isn't the sort of secret we suppose."

The Duke came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head of the table with all his native
dignity. The embarrassment of the librarian left him hovering on his hind legs, like a huge
bear. The Duke addressed the priest with great seriousness. "Father Brown," he said, "Doctor
Mull informs me that you have come here to make a request. I no longer profess an observance
of the religion of my fathers; but for their sakes, and for the sake of the days when we met
before, I am very willing to hear you. But I presume you would rather be heard in private."

Whatever I retain of the gentleman made me stand up. Whatever I have attained of the journalist
made me stand still. Before this paralysis could pass, the priest had made a momentarily detaining
motion. "If," he said, "your Grace will permit me my real petition, or if I retain any right
to advise you, I would urge that as many people as possible should be present. All over this
country I have found hundreds, even of my own faith and flock, whose imaginations are poisoned
by the spell which I implore you to break. I wish we could have all Devonshire here to see
you do it."

"To see me do what?" asked the Duke, arching his eyebrows.

"To see you take off your wig," said Father Brown.

The Duke's face did not move; but he looked at his petitioner with a glassy stare which was
the most awful expression I have ever seen on a human face. I could see the librarian's great
legs wavering under him like the shadows of stems in a pool; and I could not banish from my
own brain the fancy that the trees all around us were filling softly in the silence with devils
instead of birds.

"I spare you," said the Duke in a voice of inhuman pity. "I refuse. If I gave you the faintest
hint of the load of horror I have to bear alone, you would lie shrieking at these feet of mine
and begging to know no more. I will spare you the hint. You shall not spell the first letter
of what is written on the altar of the Unknown God."

"I know the Unknown God," said the little priest, with an unconscious grandeur of certitude

 But Brown
was still rather weak; he was no very happy sailor; and though he was never of the sort that
either grumbles or breaks down, his spirits did not rise above patience and civility. When
the other two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags, he agreed
with them. When Flambeau pointed out a rock shaped like a dragon, he looked at it and thought
it very like a dragon. When Fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like Merlin, he
looked at it, and signified assent. When Flambeau asked whether this rocky gate of the twisted
river was not the gate of Fairyland, he said "Yes." He heard the most important things and
the most trivial with the same tasteless absorption. He heard that the coast was death to all
but careful seamen; he also heard that the ship's cat was asleep. He heard that Fanshaw couldn't
find his cigar-holder anywhere; he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle "Both eyes bright,
she's all right; one eye winks, down she sinks." He heard Flambeau say to Fanshaw that no doubt
this meant the pilot must keep both eyes open and be spry. And he heard Fanshaw say to Flambeau
that, oddly enough, it didn't mean this: it meant that while they saw two of the coast lights,
one near and the other distant, exactly side by side, they were in the right river-channel;
but that if one light was hidden behind the other, they were going on the rocks. He heard Fanshaw
add that his country was full of such quaint fables and idioms; it was the very home of romance;
he even pitted this part of Cornwall against Devonshire, as a claimant to the laurels of Elizabethan
seamanship. According to him there had been captains among these coves and islets compared
with whom Drake was practically a landsman. He heard Flambeau laugh, and ask if, perhaps, the
adventurous title of "Westward Ho!" only meant that all Devonshire men wished they were living
in Cornwall. He heard Fanshaw say there was no need to be silly; that not only had Cornish
captains been heroes, but that they were heroes still: that near that very spot there was an
old admiral, now retired, who was scarred by thrilling voyages full of adventures; and who
had in his youth found the last group of eight Pacific Islands that was added to the chart
of the world. This Cecil Fanshaw was, in person, of the kind that commonly urges such crude
but pleasing enthusiasms; a very young man, light-haired, high-coloured, with an eager profile;
with a boyish bravado of spirits, but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type. The big
shoulders, black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of Flambeau were a great contrast.

All these trivialities Brown heard and saw; but heard them as a tired man hears a tune in the
railway wheels, or saw them as a sick man sees the pattern of his wall-paper. No one can calculate
the turns of mood in convalescence: but Father Brown's depression must have had a great deal
to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea. For as the river mouth narrowed like the neck
of a bottle, and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly, he seemed to wake
up and take notice like a baby. They had reached that phase just after sunset when air and
water both look bright, but earth and all its growing things look almost black by comparison.
About this particular evening, however, there was something exceptional. It was one of those
rare atmospheres in which a smoked-glass slide seems to have been slid away from between us
and Nature; so that even dark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours on
cloudier days. The trampled earth of the river-banks and the peaty stain in the pools did not
look drab but glowing umber, and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look, as usual,
dim blue with mere depth of distance, but more like wind-tumbled masses of some vivid violet
blossom. This magic clearness and intensity in the colours was further forced on Brown's slowly
reviving senses by something romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape.

The river was still well wide and deep enough for a pleasure boat so small as theirs; but the
curves of the country-side suggested that it was closing in on either hand; the woods seemed
to be making broken and flying attempts at bridge-building--as if the boat were passing from
the romance of a valley to the romance of a hollow and so to the supreme romance of a tunnel.
Beyond this mere look of things there was little for Brown's freshening fancy to feed on; he
saw no human beings, except some gipsies trailing along the river bank, with faggots and osiers
cut in the forest; and one sight no longer unconventional, but in such remote parts still uncommon:
a dark-haired lady, bare-headed, and paddling her own canoe. If Father Brown ever attached
any importance to either of these, he certainly forgot them at the next turn of the river which
brought in sight a singular object.

The water seemed to widen and split, being cloven by the dark wedge of a fish-shaped and wooded
islet. With the rate at which they went, the islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship;
a ship with a very high prow--or, to speak more strictly, a very high funnel. For at the extreme
point nearest them stood up an odd-looking building, unlike anything they could remember or
connect with any purpose. It was not specially high, but it was too high for its breadth to
be called anything but a tower. Yet it appeared to be built entirely of wood, and that in a
most unequal and eccentric way. Some of the planks and beams were of good, seasoned oak; some
of such wood cut raw and recent; some again of white pinewood, and a great deal more of the
same sort of wood painted black with tar. These black beams were set crooked or crisscross
at all kinds of angles, giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance. There were
one or two windows, which appeared to be coloured and leaded in an old-fashioned but more elaborate
style. The travellers looked at it with that paradoxical feeling we have when something reminds
us of something, and yet we are certain it is something very different.

Father Brown, even when he was mystified, was clever in analysing his own mystification. And
he found himself reflecting that the oddity seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out
in an incongruous material; as if one saw a top-hat made of tin, or a frock-coat cut out of
tartan. He was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arranged like that somewhere, but
never in such architectural proportions. The next moment a glimpse through the dark trees told
him all he wanted to know and he laughed. Through a gap in the foliage there appeared for a
moment one of those old wooden houses, faced with black beams, which are still to be found
here and there in England, but which most of us see imitated in some show called "Old London"
or "Shakespeare's England'. It was in view only long enough for the priest to see that, however
old-fashioned, it was a comfortable and well-kept country-house, with flower-beds in front
of it. It had none of the piebald and crazy look of the tower that seemed made out of its refuse.

"What on earth's this?" said Flambeau, who was still staring at the tower.

Fanshaw's eyes were shining, and he spoke triumphantly. "Aha! you've not seen a place quite
like this before, I fancy; that's why I've brought you here, my friend. Now you shall see whether
I exaggerate about the mariners of Cornwall. This place belongs to Old Pendragon, whom we call
the Admiral; though he retired before getting the rank. The spirit of Raleigh and Hawkins is
a memory with the Devon folk; it's a modern fact with the Pendragons. If Queen Elizabeth were
to rise from the grave and come up this river in a gilded barge, she would be received by the
Admiral in a house exactly such as she was accustomed to, in every corner and casement, in
every panel on the wall or plate on the table. And she would find an English Captain still
talking fiercely of fresh lands to be found in little ships, as much as if she had dined with
Drake."

"She'd find a rum sort of thing in the garden," said Father Brown, "which would not please
her Renaissance eye. That Elizabethan domestic architecture is charming in its way; but it's
against the very nature of it to break out into turrets."

"And yet," answered Fanshaw, "that's the most romantic and Elizabethan part of the business.
It was built by the Pendragons in the very days of the Spanish wars; and though it's needed
patching and even rebuilding for another reason, it's always been rebuilt in the old way. The
story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon built it in this place and to this height,
because from the top you can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth; and
she wished to be the first to see her husband's ship, as he sailed home from the Spanish Main."

"For what other reason," asked Father Brown, "do you mean that it has been rebuilt?"

"Oh, there's a strange story about that, too," said the young squire with relish. "You are
really in a land of strange stories. King Arthur was here and Merlin and the fairies before
him. The story goes that Sir Peter Pendragon, who (I fear) had some of the faults of the pirates
as well as the virtues of the sailor, was bringing home three Spanish gentlemen in honourable
captivity, intending to escort them to Elizabeth's court. But he was a man of flaming and tigerish
temper, and coming to high words with one of them, he caught him by the throat and flung him
by accident or design, into the sea. A second Spaniard, who was the brother of the first, instantly
drew his sword and flew at Pendragon, and after a short but furious combat in which both got
three wounds in as many minutes, Pendragon drove his blade through the other's body and the
second Spaniard was accounted for. As it happened the ship had already turned into the river
mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water. The third Spaniard sprang over the side
of the ship, struck out for the shore, and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist
in water. And turning again to face the ship, and holding up both arms to Heaven--like a prophet
calling plagues upon a wicked city--he called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice,
that he at least was yet living, that he would go on living, that he would live for ever; and
that generation after generation the house of Pendragon should never see him or his, but should
know by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive. With that he dived under the
wave, and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen
afterwards."

"There's that girl in the canoe again," said Flambeau irrelevantly, for good-looking young
women would call him off any topic. "She seems bothered by the queer tower just as we were."

Indeed, the black-haired young lady was letting her canoe float slowly and silently past the
strange islet; and was looking intently up at the strange tower, with a strong glow of curiosity
on her oval and olive face.

"Never mind girls," said Fanshaw impatiently, "there are plenty of them in the world, but not
many things like the Pendragon Tower. As you may easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and
scandals have followed in the track of the Spaniard's curse; and no doubt, as you would put
it, any accident happening to this Cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity.
But it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times; and the family
can't be called lucky, for more than two, I think, of the Admiral's near kin have perished
by shipwreck; and one at least, to my own knowledge, on practically the same spot where Sir
Peter threw the Spaniard overboard."

"What a pity!" exclaimed Flambeau. "She's going."

"When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history?" asked Father Brown, as the
girl in the canoe paddled off, without showing the least intention of extending her interest
from the tower to the yacht, which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alongside the island.

"Many years ago," replied Fanshaw; "he hasn't been to sea for some time now, though he is as
keen on it as ever. I believe there's a family compact or something. Well, here's the landing
stage; let's come ashore and see the old boy."

They followed him on to the island, just under the tower, and Father Brown, whether from the
mere touch of dry land, or the interest of something on the other bank of the river (which
he stared at very hard for some seconds), seemed singularly improved in briskness. They entered
a wooded avenue between two fences of thin greyish wood, such as often enclose parks or gardens,
and over the top of which the dark trees tossed to and fro like black and purple plumes upon
the hearse of a giant. The tower, as they left it behind, looked all the quainter, because
such entrances are usually flanked by two towers; and this one looked lopsided. But for this,
the avenue had the usual appearance of the entrance to a gentleman's grounds; and, being so
curved that the house was now out of sight, somehow looked a much larger park than any plantation
on such an island could really be. Father Brown was, perhaps, a little fanciful in his fatigue,
but he almost thought the whole place must be growing larger, as things do in a nightmare.
Anyhow, a mystical monotony was the only character of their march, until Fanshaw suddenly stopped,
and pointed to something sticking out through the grey fence--something that looked at first
rather like the imprisoned horn of some beast. Closer observation showed that it was a slightly
curved blade of metal that shone faintly in the fading light.

Flambeau, who like all Frenchmen had been a soldier, bent over it and said in a startled voice:
"Why, it's a sabre! I believe I know the sort, heavy and curved, but shorter than the cavalry;
they used to have them in artillery and the--"

As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made and came down again with
a more ponderous slash, splitting the fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise.
Then it was pulled out again, flashed above the fence some feet further along, and again split
it halfway down with the first stroke; and after waggling a little to extricate itself (accompanied
with curses in the darkness) split it down to the ground with a second. Then a kick of devilish
energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway, and a great gap
of dark coppice gaped in the paling.

Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and uttered an exclamation of astonishment. "My dear Admiral!"
he exclaimed, "do you--er--do you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to go
for a walk?"

The voice in the gloom swore again, and then broke into a jolly laugh. "No," it said; "I've
really got to cut down this fence somehow; it's spoiling all the plants, and no one else here
can do it. But I'll only carve another bit off the front door, and then come out and welcome you."

And sure enough, he heaved up his weapon once more, and, hacking twice, brought down another
and similar strip of fence, making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all. Then through
this larger forest gateway he came out into the evening light, with a chip of grey wood sticking
to his sword-blade.

He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw's fable of an old piratical Admiral; though the details
seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents. For instance, he wore a broad-brimmed hat as
protection against the sun; but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky, and
the two corners pulled down lower than the ears, so that it stood across his forehead in a
crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson. He wore an ordinary dark-blue jacket, with
nothing special about the buttons, but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow
had a sailorish look. He was tall and loose, and walked with a sort of swagger, which was not
a sailor's roll, and yet somehow suggested it; and he held in his hand a short sabre which
was like a navy cutlass, but about twice as big. Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face
looked eager, all the more because it was not only clean-shaven, but without eyebrows. It seemed
almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through a throng of elements.
His eyes were prominent and piercing. His colour was curiously attractive, while partly tropical;
it reminded one vaguely of a blood-orange. That is, that while it was ruddy and sanguine, there
was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly, but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of
the Hesperides--Father Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive of all the romances
about the countries of the Sun.

When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell again into a tone of rallying
the latter about his wreckage of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity. The Admiral
pooh-poohed it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work; but at length the
ring of real energy came back into his laughter, and he cried with a mixture of impatience
and good humour:

"Well, perhaps I do go at it a bit rabidly, and feel a kind of pleasure in smashing anything.
So would you if your only pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands,
and you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond. When I remember
how I've cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp
as this; and then remember I must stop here and chop this matchwood, because of some confounded
old bargain scribbled in a family Bible, why, I--"

He swung up the heavy steel again; and this time sundered the wall of wood from top to bottom
at one stroke.

"I feel like that," he said laughing, but furiously flinging the sword some yards down the
path, "and now let's go up to the house; you must have some dinner."

The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three circular garden beds, one
of red tulips, a second of yellow tulips, and the third of some white, waxen-looking blossoms
that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic. A heavy, hairy and rather sullen-looking
gardener was hanging up a heavy coil of garden hose. The corners of the expiring sunset which
seemed to cling about the corners of the house gave glimpses here and there of the colours
of remoter flowerbeds; and in a treeless space on one side of the house opening upon the river
stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope. Just outside the steps
of the porch stood a little painted green garden table, as if someone had just had tea there.
The entrance was flanked with two of those half-featured lumps of stone with holes for eyes
that are said to be South Sea idols; and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some
confused carvings that looked almost as barbaric.

As they passed indoors, the little cleric hopped suddenly on to the table, and standing on
it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak. Admiral Pendragon
looked very much astonished, though not particularly annoyed; while Fanshaw was so amused with
what looked like a performing pigmy on his little stand, that he could not control his laughter.
But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonishment.

He was gazing at three carved symbols, which, though very worn and obscure, seemed still to
convey some sense to him. The first seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building,
crowned with what looked like curly-pointed ribbons. The second was clearer: an old Elizabethan
galley with decorative waves beneath it, but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged
rock, which was either a fault in the wood or some conventional representation of the water
coming in. The third represented the upper half of a human figure, ending in an escalloped
line like the waves; the face was rubbed and featureless, and both arms were held very stiffly
up in the air.

"Well," muttered Father Brown, blinking, "here is the legend of the Spaniard plain enough.
Here he is holding up his arms and cursing in the sea; and here are the two curses: the wrecked
ship and the burning of Pendragon Tower."

Pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement. "And how many other things might
it not be?" he said. "Don't you know that that sort of half-man, like a half-lion or half-stag,
is quite common in heraldry? Might not that line through the ship be one of those parti-per-pale
lines, indented, I think they call it? And though the third thing isn't so very heraldic, it
would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire; and it looks
just as like it."

"But it seems rather odd," said Flambeau, "that it should exactly confirm the old legend."

"Ah," replied the sceptical traveller, "but you don't know how much of the old legend may have
been made up from the old figures. Besides, it isn't the only old legend. Fanshaw, here, who
is fond of such things, will tell you there are other versions of the tale, and much more horrible
ones. One story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the Spaniard cut in two; and
that will fit the pretty picture also. Another obligingly credits our family with the possession
of a tower full of snakes and explains those little, wriggly things in that way. And a third
theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt; but that
alone, if seriously examined, would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences
really go."

"Why, how do you mean?" asked Fanshaw.

"It so happens," replied his host coolly, "that there was no thunder and lightning at all in
the two or three shipwrecks I know of in our family."

"Oh!" said Father Brown, and jumped down from the little table.

There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur of the river; then Fanshaw
said, in a doubtful and perhaps disappointed tone: "Then you don't think there is anything
in the tales of the tower in flames?"

"There are the tales, of course," said the Admiral, shrugging his shoulders; "and some of them,
I don't deny, on evidence as decent as one ever gets for such things. Someone saw a blaze hereabout,
don't you know, as he walked home through a wood; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland
thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower. Well, a damp dab of mud like this confounded
island seems the last place where one would think of fires."

"What is that fire over there?" asked Father Brown with a gentle suddenness, pointing to the
woods on the left river-bank. They were all thrown a little off their balance, and the more
fanciful Fanshaw had even some difficulty in recovering his, as they saw a long, thin stream
of blue smoke ascending silently into the end of the evening light.

Then Pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again. "Gipsies!" he said; "they've been camping
about here for about a week. Gentlemen, you want your dinner," and he turned as if to enter
the house.

But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering, and he said hastily: "But,
Admiral, what's that hissing noise quite near the island? It's very like fire."

"It's more like what it is," said the Admiral, laughing as he led the way; "it's only some
canoe going by."

Almost as he spoke, the butler, a lean man in black, with very black hair and a very long,
yellow face, appeared in the doorway and told him that dinner was served.

The dining-room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship; but its note was rather that of the
modern than the Elizabethan captain. There were, indeed, three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy
over the fireplace, and one brown sixteenth-century map with Tritons and little ships dotted
about a curly sea. But such things were less prominent on the white panelling than some cases
of quaint-coloured South American birds, very scientifically stuffed, fantastic shells from
the Pacific, and several instruments so rude and queer in shape that savages might have used
them either to kill their enemies or to cook them. But the alien colour culminated in the fact
that, besides the butler, the Admiral's only servants were two negroes, somewhat quaintly clad
in tight uniforms of yellow. The priest's instinctive trick of analysing his own impressions
told him that the colour and the little neat coat-tails of these bipeds had suggested the word
"Canary," and so by a mere pun connected them with southward travel. The s was found of period

Flambeau looked once more inland and out to sea, and once more could see nothing but seas as
wintry as the snow, and snows as level as the sea.

There came a scurrying noise behind him, and the little priest came scrambling out of the hole
faster than he had fallen in. His face was no longer disconcerted, but rather resolute, and,
perhaps only through the reflections of the snow, a trifle paler than usual.

"Well?" asked his tall friend. "Have you found the god of the temple?"

"No," answered Father Brown. "I have found what was sometimes more important. The Sacrifice."

"What the devil do you mean?" cried Flambeau, quite alarmed.

Father Brown did not answer. He was staring, with a knot in his forehead, at the landscape;
and he suddenly pointed at it. "What's that house over there?" he asked.

Following his finger, Flambeau saw for the first time the corners of a building nearer than
the farmhouse, but screened for the most part with a fringe of trees. It was not a large building,
and stood well back from the shore--, but a glint of ornament on it suggested that it was part
of the same watering-place scheme of decoration as the bandstand, the little gardens and the
curly-backed iron seats.

Father Brown jumped off the bandstand, his friend following; and as they walked in the direction
indicated the trees fell away to right and left, and they saw a small, rather flashy hotel,
such as is common in resorts--the hotel of the Saloon Bar rather than the Bar Parlour. Almost
the whole frontage was of gilt plaster and figured glass, and between that grey seascape and
the grey, witch-like trees, its gimcrack quality had something spectral in its melancholy.
They both felt vaguely that if any food or drink were offered at such a hostelry, it would
be the paste-board ham and empty mug of the pantomime.

In this, however, they were not altogether confirmed. As they drew nearer and nearer to the
place they saw in front of the buffet, which was apparently closed, one of the iron garden-seats
with curly backs that had adorned the gardens, but much longer, running almost the whole length
of the frontage. Presumably, it was placed so that visitors might sit there and look at the
sea, but one hardly expected to find anyone doing it in such weather.

Nevertheless, just in front of the extreme end of the iron seat stood a small round restaurant
table, and on this stood a small bottle of Chablis and a plate of almonds and raisins. Behind
the table and on the seat sat a dark-haired young man, bareheaded, and gazing at the sea in
a state of almost astonishing immobility.

But though he might have been a waxwork when they were within four yards of him, he jumped
up like a jack-in-the-box when they came within three, and said in a deferential, though not
undignified, manner: "Will you step inside, gentlemen? I have no staff at present, but I can
get you anything simple myself."

"Much obliged," said Flambeau. "So you are the proprietor?"

"Yes," said the dark man, dropping back a little into his motionless manner. "My waiters are
all Italians, you see, and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the
black, if he really can do it. You know the great fight between Malvoli and Nigger Ned is coming
off after all?"

"I'm afraid we can't wait to trouble your hospitality seriously," said Father Brown. "But my
friend would be glad of a glass of sherry, I'm sure, to keep out the cold and drink success
to the Latin champion."

Flambeau did not understand the sherry, but he did not object to it in the least. He could
only say amiably: "Oh, thank you very much."

"Sherry, sir--certainly," said their host, turning to his hostel. "Excuse me if I detain you
a few minutes. As I told you, I have no staff--" And he went towards the black windows of his
shuttered and unlighted inn.

"Oh, it doesn't really matter," began Flambeau, but the man turned to reassure him.

"I have the keys," he said. "I could find my way in the dark."

"I didn't mean--" began Father Brown.

He was interrupted by a bellowing human voice that came out of the bowels of the uninhabited
hotel. It thundered some foreign name loudly but inaudibly, and the hotel proprietor moved
more sharply towards it than he had done for Flambeau's sherry. As instant evidence proved,
the proprietor had told, then and after, nothing but the literal truth. But both Flambeau and
Father Brown have often confessed that, in all their (often outrageous) adventures, nothing
had so chilled their blood as that voice of an ogre, sounding suddenly out of a silent and
empty inn.

"My cook!" cried the proprietor hastily. "I had forgotten my cook. He will be starting presently.
Sherry, sir?"

And, sure enough, there appeared in the doorway a big white bulk with white cap and white apron,
as befits a cook, but with the needless emphasis of a black face. Flambeau had often heard
that negroes made good cooks. But somehow something in the contrast of colour and caste increased
his surprise that the hotel proprietor should answer the call of the cook, and not the cook
the call of the proprietor. But he reflected that head cooks are proverbially arrogant; and,
besides, the host had come back with the sherry, and that was the great thing.

"I rather wonder," said Father Brown, "that there are so few people about the beach, when this
big fight is coming on after all. We only met one man for miles."

The hotel proprietor shrugged his shoulders. "They come from the other end of the town, you
see--from the station, three miles from here. They are only interested in the sport, and will
stop in hotels for the night only. After all, it is hardly weather for basking on the shore."

"Or on the seat," said Flambeau, and pointed to the little table.

"I have to keep a look-out," said the man with the motionless face. He was a quiet, well-featured
fellow, rather sallow; his dark clothes had nothing distinctive about them, except that his
black necktie was worn rather high, like a stock, and secured by a gold pin with some grotesque
head to it. Nor was there anything notable in the face, except something that was probably
a mere nervous trick--a habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other, giving the impression
that the other was larger, or was, perhaps, artificial.

The silence that ensued was broken by their host saying quietly: "Whereabouts did you meet
the one man on your march?"

"Curiously enough," answered the priest, "close by here--just by that bandstand."

Flambeau, who had sat on the long iron seat to finish his sherry, put it down and rose to his
feet, staring at his friend in amazement. He opened his mouth to speak, and then shut it again.

"Curious," said the dark-haired man thoughtfully. "What was he like?"

"It was rather dark when I saw him," began Father Brown, "but he was--"

As has been said, the hotel-keeper can be proved to have told the precise truth. His phrase
that the cook was starting presently was fulfilled to the letter, for the cook came out, pulling
his gloves on, even as they spoke.

But he was a very different figure from the confused mass of white and black that had appeared
for an instant in the doorway. He was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the
most brilliant fashion. A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head--a hat of the sort
that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors. But somehow the black man was like the black
hat. He also was black, and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more.
It is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat. The red
flower stood up in his buttonhole aggressively, as if it had suddenly grown there. And in the
way he carried his cane in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude--an
attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices: something innocent and
insolent--the cake walk.

"Sometimes," said Flambeau, looking after him, "I'm not surprised that they lynch them."

"I am never surprised," said Father Brown, "at any work of hell. But as I was saying," he resumed,
as the negro, still ostentatiously pulling on his yellow gloves, betook himself briskly towards
the watering-place, a queer music-hall figure against that grey and frosty scene--"as I was
saying, I couldn't describe the man very minutely, but he had a flourish and old-fashioned
whiskers and moustachios, dark or dyed, as in the pictures of foreign financiers, round his
neck was wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked. It was fixed
at the throat rather in the way that nurses fix children's comforters with a safety-pin. Only
this," added the priest, gazing placidly out to sea, "was not a safety-pin."

The man sitting on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly out to sea. Now he was once
more in repose. Flambeau felt quite certain that one of his eyes was naturally larger than
the other. Both were now well opened, and he could almost fancy the left eye grew larger as
he gazed.

"It was a very long gold pin, and had the carved head of a monkey or some such thing," continued
the cleric; "and it was fixed in a rather odd way--he wore pince-nez and a broad black--"

The motionless man continued to gaze at the sea, and the eyes in his head might have belonged
to two different men. Then he made a movement of blinding swiftness.

Father Brown had his back to him, and in that flash might have fallen dead on his face. Flambeau
had no weapon, but his large brown hands were resting on the end of the long iron seat. His
shoulders abruptly altered their shape, and he heaved the whole huge thing high over his head,
like a headsman's axe about to fall. The mere height of the thing, as he held it vertical,
looked like a long iron ladder by which he was inviting men to climb towards the stars. But
the long shadow, in the level evening light, looked like a giant brandishing the Eiffel Tower.
It was the shock of that shadow, before the shock of the iron crash, that made the stranger
quail and dodge, and then dart into his inn, leaving the flat and shining dagger he had dropped
exactly where it had fallen.

"We must get away from here instantly," cried Flambeau, flinging the huge seat away with furious
indifference on the beach. He caught the little priest by the elbow and ran him down a grey
perspective of barren back garden, at the end of which there was a closed back garden door.
Flambeau bent over it an instant in violent silence, and then said: "The door is locked."

As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell, brushing the brim of his
hat. It startled him more than the small and distant detonation that had come just before.
Then came another distant detonation, and the door he was trying to open shook under the bullet
buried in it. Flambeau's shoulders again filled out and altered suddenly. Three hinges and
a lock burst at the same instant, and he went out into the empty path behind, carrying the
great garden door with him, as Samson carried the gates of Gaza.

Then he flung the garden door over the garden wall, just as a third shot picked up a spurt
of snow and dust behind his heel. Without ceremony he snatched up the little priest, slung
him astraddle on his shoulders, and went racing towards Seawood as fast as his long legs could
carry him. It was not until nearly two miles farther on that he set his small companion down.
It had hardly been a dignified escape, in spite of the classic model of Anchises, but Father
Brown's face only wore a broad grin.

"Well," said Flambeau, after an impatient silence, as they resumed their more conventional
tramp through the streets on the edge of the town, where no outrage need be feared, "I don't
know what all this means, but I take it I may trust my own eyes that you never met the man
you have so accurately described."

"I did meet him in a way," Brown said, biting his finger rather nervously--"I did really. And
it was too dark to see him properly, because it was under that bandstand affair. But I'm afraid
I didn't describe him so very accurately after all, for his pince-nez was broken under him,
and the long gold pin wasn't stuck through his purple scarf but through his heart."

"And I suppose," said the other in a lower voice, "that glass-eyed guy had something to do
with it."

"I had hoped he had only a little," answered Brown in a rather troubled voice, "and I may have
been wrong in what I did. I acted on impulse. But I fear this business has deep roots and dark."

They walked on through some streets in silence. The yellow lamps were beginning to be lit in
the cold blue twilight, and they were evidently approaching the more central parts of the town.
Highly coloured bills announcing the glove-fight between Nigger Ned and Malvoli were slapped
about the walls.

"Well," said Flambeau, "I never murdered anyone, even in my criminal days, but I can almost
sympathize with anyone doing it in such a dreary place. Of all God-forsaken dustbins of Nature,
I think the most heart-breaking are places like that bandstand, that were meant to be festive
and are forlorn. I can fancy a morbid man feeling he must kill his rival in the solitude and
irony of such a scene. I remember once taking a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills, thinking
of nothing but gorse and skylarks, when I came out on a vast circle of land, and over me lifted
a vast, voiceless structure, tier above tier of seats, as huge as a Roman amphitheatre and
as empty as a new letter-rack. A bird sailed in heaven over it. It was the Grand Stand at Epsom.
And I felt that no one would ever be happy there again."

"It's odd you should mention Epsom," said the priest. "Do you remember what was called the
Sutton Mystery, because two suspected men--ice-cream men, I think--happened to live at Sutton?
They were eventually released. A man was found strangled, it was said, on the Downs round that
part. As a fact, I know (from an Irish policeman who is a friend of mine) that he was found
close up to the Epsom Grand Stand--in fact, only hidden by one of the lower doors being pushed
back."

"That is queer," assented Flambeau. "But it rather confirms my view that such pleasure places
look awfully lonely out of season, or the man wouldn't have been murdered there."

"I'm not so sure he--" began Brown, and stopped.

"Not so sure he was murdered?" queried his companion.

"Not so sure he was murdered out of the season," answered the little priest, with simplicity.
"Don't you think there's something rather tricky about this solitude, Flambeau? Do you feel
sure a wise murderer would always want the spot to be lonely? It's very, very seldom a man
is quite alone. And, short of that, the more alone he is, the more certain he is to be seen.
No; I think there must be some other--Why, here we are at the Pavilion or Palace, or whatever
they call it."

They had emerged on a small square, brilliantly lighted, of which the principal building was
gay with gilding, gaudy with posters, and flanked with two giant photographs of Malvoli and
Nigger Ned.

"Hallo!" cried Flambeau in great surprise, as his clerical friend stumped straight up the broad
steps. "I didn't know pugilism was your latest hobby. Are you going to see the fight?"

"I don't think there will be any fight," replied Father Brown.

They passed rapidly through ante-rooms and inner rooms; they passed through the hall of combat
itself, raised, roped, and padded with innumerable seats and boxes, and still the cleric did
not look round or pause till he came to a clerk at a desk outside a door marked "Committee".
There he stopped and asked to see Lord Pooley.

The attendant observed that his lordship was very busy, as the fight was coming on soon, but
Father Brown had a good-tempered tedium of reiteration for which the official mind is generally
not prepared. In a few moments the rather baffled Flambeau found himself in the presence of
a man who was still shouting directions to another man going out of the room. "Be careful,
you know, about the ropes after the fourth--Well, and what do you want, I wonder!"

Lord Pooley was a gentleman, and, like most of the few remaining to our race, was worried--especially
about money. He was half grey and half flaxen, and he had the eyes of fever and a high-bridged,
frost-bitten nose.

"Only a word," said Father Brown. "I have come to prevent a man being killed."

Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a spring had flung him from it. "I'm damned if I'll
stand any more of this!" he cried. "You and your committees and parsons and petitions! Weren't
there parsons in the old days, when they fought without gloves? Now they're fighting with the
regulation gloves, and there's not the rag of a possibility of either of the boxers being killed."

"I didn't mean either of the boxers," said the little priest.

"Well, well, well!" said the nobleman, with a touch of frosty humour. "Who's going to be killed?
The referee?"

"I don't know who's going to be killed," replied Father Brown, with a reflective stare. "If
I did I shouldn't have to spoil your pleasure. I could simply get him to escape. I never could
see anything wrong about prize-fights. As it is, I must ask you to announce that the fight
is off for the present."

"Anything else?" jeered the gentleman with feverish eyes. "And what do you say to the two thousand
people who have come to see it?"

"I say there will be one thousand nine-hundred and ninety-nine of them left alive when they
have seen it," said Father Brown.

Lord Pooley looked at Flambeau. "Is your friend mad?" he asked.

"Far from it," was the reply.

"And look here," resumed Pooley in his restless way, "it's worse than that. A whole pack of
Italians have turned up to back Malvoli--swarthy, savage fellows of some country, anyhow. You
know what these Mediterranean races are like. If I send out word that it's off we shall have
Malvoli storming in here at the head of a whole Corsican clan."

"My lord, it is a matter of life and death," said the priest. "Ring your bell. Give your message.
And see whether it is Malvoli who answers."

The nobleman struck the bell on the table with an odd air of new curiosity. He said to the
clerk who appeared almost instantly in the doorway: "I have a serious announcement to make
to the audience shortly. Meanwhile, would you kindly tell the two champions that the fight
will have to be put off."

The clerk stared for some seconds as if at a demon and vanished.

"What authority have you for what you say?" asked Lord Pooley abruptly. "Whom did you consult?"

"I consulted a bandstand," said Father Brown, scratching his head. "But, no, I'm wrong; I consulted
a book, too. I picked it up on a bookstall in London--very cheap, too."

He had taken out of his pocket a small, stout, leather-bound volume, and Flambeau, looking
over his shoulder, could see that it was some book of old travels, and had a leaf turned down
for reference.

"'The only form in which Voodoo--'" began Father Brown, reading aloud.

"In which what?" inquired his lordship.

"'In which Voodoo,'" repeated the reader, almost with relish, "'is widely organized outside
Jamaica itself is in the form known as the Monkey, or the God of the Gongs, which is powerful
in many parts of the two American continents, especially among half-breeds, many of whom look
exactly like white men. It differs from most other forms of devil-worship and human sacrifice
in the fact that the blood is not shed formally on the altar, but by a sort of assassination
among the crowd. The gongs beat with a deafening din as the doors of the shrine open and the
monkey-god is revealed; almost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic eyes on him. But after--'"

The door of the room was flung open, and the fashionable negro stood framed in it, his eyeballs
rolling, his silk hat still insolently tilted on his head. "Huh!" he cried, showing his apish
teeth. "What this? Huh! Huh! You steal a coloured gentleman's prize--prize his already--yo'
think yo' jes' save that white 'Talian trash--"

"The matter is only deferred," said the nobleman quietly. "I will be with you to explain in
a minute or two."

"Who you to--" shouted Nigger Ned, beginning to storm.

"My name is Pooley," replied the other, with a creditable coolness. "I am the organizing secretary,
and I advise you just now to leave the room."

"Who this fellow?" demanded the dark champion, pointing to the priest disdainfully.

"My name is Brown," was the reply. "And I advise you just now to leave the country."

The prize-fighter stood glaring for a few seconds, and then, rather to the surprise of Flambeau
and the others, strode out, sending the door to with a crash behind him.

"Well," asked Father Brown rubbing his dusty hair up, "what do you think of Leonardo da Vinci?
A beautiful Italian head."

"Look here," said Lord Pooley, "I've taken a considerable responsibility, on your bare word.
I think you ought to tell me more about this."

"You are quite right, my lord," answered Brown. "And it won't take long to tell." He put the
little leather book in his overcoat pocket. "I think we know all that this can tell us, but
you shall look at it to see if I'm right. That negro who has just swaggered out is one of the
most dangerous men on earth, for he has the brains of a European, with the instincts of a cannibal.
He has turned what was clean, common-sense butchery among his fellow-barbarians into a very
modern and scientific secret society of assassins. He doesn't know I know it, nor, for the
matter of that, that I can't prove it."

There was a silence, and the little man went on.

"But if I want to murder somebody, will it really be the best plan to make sure I'm alone with
him?"

Lord Pooley's eyes recovered their frosty twinkle as he looked at the little clergyman. He
only said: "If you want to murder somebody, I should advise it."

Father Brown shook his head, like a murderer of much riper experience. "So Flambeau said,"
he replied, with a sigh. "But consider. The more a man feels lonely the less he can be sure
he is alone. It must mean empty spaces round him, and they are just what make him obvious.
Have you never seen one ploughman from the heights, or one shepherd from the valleys? Have
you never walked along a cliff, and seen one man walking along the sands? Didn't you know when
he's killed a crab, and wouldn't you have known if it had been a creditor? No! No! No! For
an intelligent murderer, such as you or I might be, it is an impossible plan to make sure that
nobody is looking at you."

"But what other plan is there?"

"There is only one," said the priest. "To make sure that everybody is looking at something
else. A man is throttled close by the big stand at Epsom. Anybody might have seen it done while
the stand stood empty--any tramp under the hedges or motorist among the hills. But nobody would
have seen it when the stand was crowded and the whole ring roaring, when the favourite was
coming in first--or wasn't. The twisting of a neck-cloth, the thrusting of a body behind a
door could be done in an instant--so long as it was that instant. It was the same, of course,"
he continued turning to Flambeau, "with that poor fellow under the bandstand. He was dropped
through the hole (it wasn't an accidental hole) just at some very dramatic moment of the entertainment,
when the bow of some great violinist or the voice of some great singer opened or came to its
climax. And here, of course, when the knock-out blow came--it would not be the only one. That
is the little trick Nigger Ned has adopted from his old God of Gongs."

"By the way, Malvoli--" Pooley began.

"Malvoli," said the priest, "has nothing to do with it. I dare say he has some Italians with
him, but our amiable friends are not Italians. They are octoroons and African half-bloods of
various shades, but I fear we English think all foreigners are much the same so long as they
are dark and dirty. Also," he added, with a smile, "I fear the English decline to draw any
fine distinction between the moral character produced by my religion and that which blooms
out of Voodoo."

The blaze of the spring season had burst upon Seawood, littering its foreshore with famines
and bathing-machines, with nomadic preachers and nigger minstrels, before the two friends saw
it again, and long before the storm of pursuit after the strange secret society had died away.
Almost on every hand the secret of their purpose perished with them. The man of the hotel was
found drifting dead on the sea like so much seaweed; his right eye was closed in peace, but
his left eye was wide open, and glistened like glass in the moon. Nigger Ned had been overtaken
a mile or two away, and murdered three policemen with his closed left hand. The remaining officer
was surprised--nay, pained--and the negro got away. But this was enough to set all the English
papers in a flame, and for a month or two the main purpose of the British Empire was to prevent
the buck nigger (who was so in both senses) escaping by any English port. Persons of a figure
remotely reconcilable with his were subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions, made to
scrub their faces before going on board ship, as if each white complexion were made up like
a mask, of greasepaint. Every negro in England was put under special regulations and made to
report himself; the outgoing ships would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk. For people
had found out how fearful and vast and silent was the force of the savage secret society, and
by the time Flambeau and Father Brown were leaning on the parade parapet in April, the Black
Man meant in England almost what he once meant in Scotland.

"He must be still in England," observed Flambeau, "and horridly well hidden, too. They must
have found him at the ports if he had only whitened his face."

"You see, he is really a clever man," said Father Brown apologetically. "And I'm sure he wouldn't
whiten his face."

"Well, but what would he do?"

"I think," said Father Brown, "he would blacken his face."

Flambeau, leaning motionless on the parapet, laughed and said: "My dear fellow!"

Father Brown, also leaning motionless on the parapet, moved one finger for an instant into
the direction of the soot-masked niggers singing on the sands.

TEN -- The Salad of Colonel Cray

FATHER BROWN was walking home from Mass on a white weird morning when the mists were slowly
lifting--one of those mornings when the very element of light appears as something mysterious
and new. The scattered trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour, as if they
were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal. At yet more distant intervals appeared
the houses upon the broken fringe of the suburb; their outlines became clearer and clearer
until he recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances, and many more the names of whose
owners he knew. But all the windows and doors were sealed; none of the people were of the sort
that would be up at such a time, or still less on such an errand. But as he passed under the
shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens, he heard a noise that made
him almost involuntarily stop. It was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some
light firearm discharged; but it was not this that puzzled him most. The first full noise was
immediately followed by a series of fainter noises--as he counted them, about six. He supposed
it must be the echo; but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like the original
sound. It was not like anything else that he could think of; the three things nearest to it
seemed to be the noise made by siphons of soda-water, one of the many noises made by an animal,
and the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter. None of which seemed to make
much sense.

Father Brown was made of two men. There was a man of action, who was as modest as a primrose
and as punctual as a clock; who went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering
it. There was also a man of reflection, who was much simpler but much stronger, who could not
easily be stopped; whose thought was always (in the only intelligent sense of the words) free
thought. He could not help, even unconsciously, asking himself all the questions that there
were to be asked, and answering as many of them as he could; all that went on like his breathing
or circulation. But he never consciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own
duty; and in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested. He was just about to resume his
trudge in the twilight, telling himself it was no affair of his, but instinctively twisting
and untwisting twenty theories about what the odd noises might mean. Then the grey sky-line
brightened into silver, and in the broadening light he realized that he had been to the house
which belonged to an Anglo-Indian Major named Putnam; and that the Major had a native cook
from Malta who was of his communion. He also began to remember that pistol-shots are sometimes
serious things; accompanied with consequences with which he was legitimately concerned. He
turned back and went in at the garden gate, making for the front door.

Half-way down one side of the house stood out a projection like a very low shed; it was, as
he afterwards discovered, a large dustbin. Round the corner of this came a figure, at first
a mere shadow in the haze, apparently bending and peering about. Then, coming nearer, it solidified
into a figure that was, indeed, rather unusually solid. Major Putnam was a bald-headed, bull-necked
man, short and very broad, with one of those rather apoplectic faces that are produced by a
prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate with the occidental luxuries. But the face
was a good-humoured one, and even now, though evidently puzzled and inquisitive, wore a kind
of innocent grin. He had a large palm-leaf hat on the back of his head (suggesting a halo that
was by no means appropriate to the face), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit
of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas; which, though glowing enough to behold, must have been,
on a fresh morning, pretty chilly to wear. He had evidently come out of his house in a hurry,
and the priest was not surprised when he called out without further ceremony: "Did you hear
that noise?"

"Yes," answered Father Brown; "I thought I had better look in, in case anything was the matter."

The Major looked at him rather queerly with his good-humoured gooseberry eyes. "What do you
think the noise was?" he asked.

"It sounded like a gun or something," replied the other, with some hesitation; "but it seemed
to have a singular sort of echo."

The Major was still looking at him quietly, but with protruding eyes, when the front door was
flung open, releasing a flood of gaslight on the face of the fading mist; and another figure
in pyjamas sprang or tumbled out into the garden. The figure was much longer, leaner, and more
athletic; the pyjamas, though equally tropical, were comparatively tasteful, being of white
with a light lemon-yellow stripe. The man was haggard, but handsome, more sunburned than the
other; he had an aquiline profile and rather deep-sunken eyes, and a slight air of oddity arising
from the combination of coal-black hair with a much lighter moustache. All this Father Brown
absorbed in detail more at leisure. For the moment he only saw one thing about the man; which
was the revolver in his hand.

"Cray!" exclaimed the Major, staring at him; "did you fire that shot?"

"Yes, I did," retorted the black-haired gentleman hotly; "and so would you in my place. If
you were chased everywhere by devils and nearly--"

The Major seemed to intervene rather hurriedly. "This is my friend Father Brown," he said.
And then to Brown: "I don't know whether you've met Colonel Cray of the Royal Artillery."

"I have heard of him, of course," said the priest innocently. "Did you--did you hit anything?"

"I thought so," answered Cray with gravity.

"Did he--" asked Major Putnam in a lowered voice, "did he fall or cry out, or anything?"

Colonel Cray was regarding his host with a strange and steady stare. "I'll tell you exactly
what he did," he said. "He sneezed."

Father Brown's hand went half-way to his head, with the gesture of a man remembering somebody's
name. He knew now what it was that was neither soda-water nor the snorting of a dog.

"Well," ejaculated the staring Major, "I never heard before that a service revolver was a thing
to be sneezed at."

"Nor I," said Father Brown faintly. "It's lucky you didn't turn your artillery on him or you
might have given him quite a bad cold." Then, after a bewildered pause, he said: "Was it a
burglar?"

"Let us go inside," said Major Putnam, rather sharply, and led the way into his house.

The interior exhibited a paradox often to be marked in such morning hours: that the rooms seemed
brighter than the sky outside; even after the Major had turned out the one gaslight in the
front hall. Father Brown was surprised to see the whole dining-table set out as for a festive
meal, with napkins in their rings, and wine-glasses of some six unnecessary shapes set beside
every plate. It was common enough, at that time of the morning, to find the remains of a banquet
over-night; but to find it freshly spread so early was unusual.

While he stood wavering in the hall Major Putnam rushed past him and sent a raging eye over
the whole oblong of the tablecloth. At last he spoke, spluttering: "All the silver gone!" he
gasped. "Fish-knives and forks gone. Old cruet-stand gone. Even the old silver cream-jug gone.
And now, Father Brown, I am ready to answer your question of whether it was a burglar."

"They're simply a blind," said Cray stubbornly. "I know better than you why people persecute
this house; I know better than you why--"

The Major patted him on the shoulder with a gesture almost peculiar to the soothing of a sick
child, and said: "It was a burglar. Obviously it was a burglar."

"A burglar with a bad cold," observed Father Brown, "that might assist you to trace him in
the neighbourhood."

The Major shook his head in a sombre manner. "He must be far beyond trace now, I fear," he said.

Then, as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards the door in the garden, he
added in a husky, confidential voice: "I doubt whether I should send for the police, for fear
my friend here has been a little too free with his bullets, and got on the wrong side of the
law. He's lived in very wild places; and, to be frank with you, I think he sometimes fancies
things."

"I think you once told me," said Brown, "that he believes some Indian secret society is pursuing
him."

Major Putnam nodded, but at the same time shrugged his shoulders. "I suppose we'd better follow
him outside," he said. "I don't want any more--shall we say, sneezing?"

They passed out into the morning light, which was now even tinged with sunshine, and saw Colonel
Cray's tall figure bent almost double, minutely examining the condition of gravel and grass.
While the Major strolled unobtrusively towards him, the priest took an equally indolent turn,
which took him round the next corner of the house to within a yard or two of the projecting
dustbin.

He stood regarding this dismal object for some minute and a half--, then he stepped towards
it, lifted the lid and put his head inside. Dust and other discolouring matter shook upwards
as he did so; but Father Brown never observed his own appearance, whatever else he observed.
He remained thus for a measurable period, as if engaged in some mysterious prayers. Then he
came out again, with some ashes on his hair, and walked unconcernedly away.

By the time he came round to the garden door again he found a group there which seemed to roll
away morbidities as the sunlight had already rolled away the mists. It was in no way rationally
reassuring; it was simply broadly comic, like a cluster of Dickens's characters. Major Putnam
had managed to slip inside and plunge into a proper shirt and trousers, with a crimson cummerbund,
and a light square jacket over all; thus normally set off, his red festive face seemed bursting
with a commonplace cordiality. He was indeed emphatic, but then he was talking to his cook--the
swarthy son of Malta, whose lean, yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with
his snow-white cap and costume. The cook might well be careworn, for cookery was the Major's
hobby. He was one of those amateurs who always know more than the professional. The only other
person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette was his friend Cray--and as Brown remembered
this, he turned to look for the other officer. In the new presence of daylight and people clothed
and in their right mind, the sight of him was rather a shock. The taller and more elegant man
was still in his night-garb, with tousled black hair, and now crawling about the garden on
his hands and knees, still looking for traces of the burglar; and now and again, to all appearance,
striking the ground with his hand in anger at not finding him. Seeing him thus quadrupedal
in the grass, the priest raised his eyebrows rather sadly; and for the first time guessed that
"fancies things" might be an euphemism.

The third item in the group of the cook and the epicure was also known to Father Brown; it
was Audrey Watson, the Major's ward and housekeeper; and at this moment, to judge by her apron,
tucked-up sleeves and resolute manner, much more the housekeeper than the ward.

"It serves you right," she was saying: "I always told you not to have that old-fashioned cruet-stand."

"I prefer it," said Putnam, placably. "I'm old-fashioned myself; and the things keep together."

"And vanish together, as you see," she retorted. "Well, if you are not going to bother about
the burglar, I shouldn't bother about the lunch. It's Sunday, and we can't send for vinegar
and all that in the town; and you Indian gentlemen can't enjoy what you call a dinner without
a lot of hot things. I wish to goodness now you hadn't asked Cousin Oliver to take me to the
musical service. It isn't over till half-past twelve, and the Colonel has to leave by then.
I don't believe you men can manage alone."

"Oh yes, we can, my dear," said the Major, looking at her very amiably. "Marco has all the
sauces, and we've often done ourselves well in very rough places, as you might know by now.
And it's time you had a treat, Audrey; you mustn't be a housekeeper every hour of the day;
and I know you want to hear the music."

"I want to go to church," she said, with rather severe eyes.

She was one of those handsome women who will always be handsome, because the beauty is not
in an air or a tint, but in the very structure of the head and features. But though she was
not yet middle-aged and her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour, there
was a look in her mouth and around her eyes which suggested that some sorrows wasted her, as
winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple. For indeed the little domestic difficulty
of which she was now speaking so decisively was rather comic than tragic. Father Brown gathered,
from the course of the conversation, that Cray, the other gourmet, had to leave before the
usual lunch-time; but that Putnam, his host, not to be done out of a final feast with an old
crony, had arranged for a special dejeuner to be set out and consumed in the course of the
morning, while Audrey and other graver persons were at morning service. She was going there
under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers, Dr Oliver Oman, who, though a scientific
man of a somewhat bitter type, was enthusiastic for music, and would go even to church to get
it. There was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern the tragedy in Miss Watson's
face; and by a half conscious instinct, Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing
about in the grass.

When he strolled across to him, the black, unbrushed head was lifted abruptly, as if in some
surprise at his continued presence. And indeed, Father Brown, for reasons best known to himself,
had lingered much longer than politeness required; or even, in the ordinary sense, permitted.

"Well!" cried Cray, with wild eyes. "I suppose you think I'm mad, like the rest?"

"I have considered the thesis," answered the little man, composedly. "And I incline to think
you are not."

"What do you mean?" snapped Cray quite savagely.

"Could you do me the favour," asked Kidd, with the courtesy of his nation, "of directing me
to the Grey Cottage, where Mr Boulnois lives, as I understand?"

"It's a few yards down the road," said the red-haired man, removing his cigar; "I shall be
passing it myself in a minute, but I'm going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun."

"What is Pendragon Park?" asked Calhoun Kidd.

"Sir Claude Champion's place--haven't you come down for that, too?" asked the other pressman,
looking up. "You're a journalist, aren't you?"

"I have come to see Mr Boulnois," said Kidd.

"I've come to see Mrs Boulnois," replied the other. "But I shan't catch her at home." And he
laughed rather unpleasantly.

"Are you interested in Catastrophism?" asked the wondering Yankee.

"I'm interested in catastrophes; and there are going to be some," replied his companion gloomily.
"Mine's a filthy trade, and I never pretend it isn't."

With that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the very act and instant one could realize that
the man had been brought up as a gentleman.

The American pressman considered him with more attention. His face was pale and dissipated,
with the promise of formidable passions yet to be loosed; but it was a clever and sensitive
face; his clothes were coarse and careless, but he had a good seal ring on one of his long,
thin fingers. His name, which came out in the course of talk, was James Dalroy; he was the
son of a bankrupt Irish landlord, and attached to a pink paper which he heartily despised,
called Smart Society, in the capacity of reporter and of something painfully like a spy.

Smart Society, I regret to say, felt none of that interest in Boulnois on Darwin which was
such a credit to the head and hearts of the Western Sun. Dalroy had come down, it seemed, to
snuff up the scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court, but which was
at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park.

Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun as well as Mr Boulnois. So
were the Pope and the Derby Winner; but the idea of their intimate acquaintanceship would have
struck Kidd as equally incongruous. He had heard of (and written about, nay, falsely pretended
to know) Sir Claude Champion, as "one of the brightest and wealthiest of England's Upper Ten";
as the great sportsman who raced yachts round the world; as the great traveller who wrote books
about the Himalayas, as the politician who swept constituencies with a startling sort of Tory
Democracy, and as the great dabbler in art, music, literature, and, above all, acting. Sir
Claude was really rather magnificent in other than American eyes. There was something of the
Renascence Prince about his omnivorous culture and restless publicity--, he was not only a
great amateur, but an ardent one. There was in him none of that antiquarian frivolity that
we convey by the word "dilettante".

That faultless falcon profile with purple-black Italian eye, which had been snap-shotted so
often both for Smart Society and the Western Sun, gave everyone the impression of a man eaten
by ambition as by a fire, or even a disease. But though Kidd knew a great deal about Sir Claude--a
great deal more, in fact, than there was to know--it would never have crossed his wildest dreams
to connect so showy an aristocrat with the newly-unearthed founder of Catastrophism, or to
guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be intimate friends. Such, according
to Dalroy's account, was nevertheless the fact. The two had hunted in couples at school and
college, and, though their social destinies had been very different (for Champion was a great
landlord and almost a millionaire, while Boulnois was a poor scholar and, until just lately,
an unknown one), they still kept in very close touch with each other. Indeed, Boulnois's cottage
stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park.

But whether the two men could be friends much longer was becoming a dark and ugly question.
A year or two before, Boulnois had married a beautiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom
he was devoted in his own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household to Champion's
had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving in a way that could not but cause
painful and rather base excitement. Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection;
and he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious in an intrigue that could
do him no sort of honour. Footmen from Pendragon were perpetually leaving bouquets for Mrs
Boulnois; carriages and motor-cars were perpetually calling at the cottage for Mrs Boulnois;
balls and masquerades perpetually filled the grounds in which the baronet paraded Mrs Boulnois,
like the Queen of Love and Beauty at a tournament. That very evening, marked by Mr Kidd for
the exposition of Catastrophism, had been marked by Sir Claude Champion for an open-air rendering
of Romeo and Juliet, in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name.

"I don't think it can go on without a smash," said the young man with red hair, getting up
and shaking himself. "Old Boulnois may be squared--or he may be square. But if he's square
he's thick--what you might call cubic. But I don't believe it's possible."

"He is a man of grand intellectual powers," said Calhoun Kidd in a deep voice.

"Yes," answered Dalroy; "but even a man of grand intellectual powers can't be such a blighted
fool as all that. Must you be going on? I shall be following myself in a minute or two."

But Calhoun Kidd, having finished a milk and soda, betook himself smartly up the road towards
the Grey Cottage, leaving his cynical informant to his whisky and tobacco. The last of the
daylight had faded; the skies were of a dark, green-grey, like slate, studded here and there
with a star, but lighter on the left side of the sky, with the promise of a rising moon.

The Grey Cottage, which stood entrenched, as it were, in a square of stiff, high thorn-hedges,
was so close under the pines and palisades of the Park that Kidd at first mistook it for the
Park Lodge. Finding the name on the narrow wooden gate, however, and seeing by his watch that
the hour of the "Thinker's" appointment had just struck, he went in and knocked at the front
door. Inside the garden hedge, he could see that the house, though unpretentious enough, was
larger and more luxurious than it looked at first, and was quite a different kind of place
from a porter's lodge. A dog-kennel and a beehive stood outside, like symbols of old English
country-life; the moon was rising behind a plantation of prosperous pear trees, the dog that
came out of the kennel was reverend-looking and reluctant to bark; and the plain, elderly man-servant
who opened the door was brief but dignified.

"Mr Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies, sir," he said, "but he has been obliged to go
out suddenly."

"But see here, I had an appointment," said the interviewer, with a rising voice. "Do you know
where he went to?"

"To Pendragon Park, sir," said the servant, rather sombrely, and began to close the door.

Kidd started a little.

"Did he go with Mrs--with the rest of the party?" he asked rather vaguely.

"No, sir," said the man shortly; "he stayed behind, and then went out alone." And he shut the
door, brutally, but with an air of duty not done.

The American, that curious compound of impudence and sensitiveness, was annoyed. He felt a
strong desire to hustle them all along a bit and teach them business habits; the hoary old
dog and the grizzled, heavy-faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt-front, and the drowsy
old moon, and above all the scatter-brained old philosopher who couldn't keep an appointment.

"If that's the way he goes on he deserves to lose his wife's purest devotion," said Mr Calhoun
Kidd. "But perhaps he's gone over to make a row. In that case I reckon a man from the Western
Sun will be on the spot."

And turning the corner by the open lodge-gates, he set off, stumping up the long avenue of
black pine-woods that pointed in abrupt perspective towards the inner gardens of Pendragon
Park. The trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse; there were still a few stars.
He was a man with more literary than direct natural associations; the word "Ravenswood" came
into his head repeatedly. It was partly the raven colour of the pine-woods; but partly also
an indescribable atmosphere almost described in Scott's great tragedy; the smell of something
that died in the eighteenth century; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns, of wrongs that
will never now be righted; of something that is none the less incurably sad because it is strangely
unreal.

More than once, as he went up that strange, black road of tragic artifice, he stopped, startled,
thinking he heard steps in front of him. He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre
walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them. At first he thought he must have fancied
it or been mocked by a mere echo of his own tramp. But as he went on he was more and more inclined
to conclude, with the remains of his reason, that there really were other feet upon the road.
He thought hazily of ghosts; and was surprised how swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate
and local ghost, one with a face as white as Pierrot's, but patched with black. The apex of
the triangle of dark-blue sky was growing brighter and bluer, but he did not realize as yet
that this was because he was coming nearer to the lights of the great house and garden. He
only felt that the atmosphere was growing more intense, there was in the sadness more violence
and secrecy--more--he hesitated for the word, and then said it with a jerk of laughter--Catastrophism.

More pines, more pathway slid past him, and then he stood rooted as by a blast of magic. It
is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a dream; but this time he felt quite certain
that he had got into a book. For we human beings are used to inappropriate things; we are accustomed
to the clatter of the incongruous; it is a tune to which we can go to sleep. If one appropriate
thing happens, it wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord. Something happened such as
would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale.

Over the black pine-wood came flying and flashing in the moon a naked sword--such a slender
and sparkling rapier as may have fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park. It fell on
the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle. He ran like a
hare and bent to look at it. Seen at close quarters it had rather a showy look: the big red
jewels in the hilt and guard were a little dubious. But there were other red drops upon the
blade which were not dubious.

He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile had come, and saw that
at this point the sable facade of fir and pine was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles;
which, when he turned it, brought him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lake
and fountains in front of it. Nevertheless, he did not look at this, having something more
interesting to look at.

Above him, at the angle of the steep green bank of the terraced garden, was one of those small
picturesque surprises common in the old landscape gardening; a kind of small round hill or
dome of grass, like a giant mole-hill, ringed and crowned with three concentric fences of roses,
and having a sundial in the highest point in the centre. Kidd could see the finger of the dial
stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight clinging
to that idle clock. But he saw something else clinging to it also, for one wild moment--the
figure of a man.

Though he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish and incredible in costume,
being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson, with glints of gold, yet he knew in one flash
of moonlight who it was. That white face flung up to heaven, clean-shaven and so unnaturally
young, like Byron with a Roman nose, those black curls already grizzled--he had seen the thousand
public portraits of Sir Claude Champion. The wild red figure reeled an instant against the
sundial; the next it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American's feet, faintly
moving one arm. A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo
and Juliet; of course the tight crimson suit was part of the play. But there was a long red
stain down the bank from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play. He had been
run through the body.

Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again. Once more he seemed to hear phantasmal footsteps,
and started to find another figure already near him. He knew the figure, and yet it terrified
him. The dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet way with him;
if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made, Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping
appointments that hadn't. The moonlight discoloured everything, against Dalroy's red hair his
wan face looked not so much white as pale green.

All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd's excuse for having cried out, brutally and beyond
all reason: "Did you do this, you devil?"

James Dalroy smiled his unpleasing smile; but before he could speak, the fallen figure made
another movement of the arm, waving vaguely towards the place where the sword fell; then came
a moan, and then it managed to speak.

"Boulnois.... Boulnois, I say.... Boulnois did it... jealous of me...he was jealous, he was,
he was..."

Kidd bent his head down to hear more, and just managed to catch the words:

"Boulnois...with my own sword...he threw it..."

Again the failing hand waved towards the sword, and then fell rigid with a thud. In Kidd rose
from its depth all that acrid humour that is the strange salt of the seriousness of his race.

"See here," he said sharply and with command, "you must fetch a doctor. This man's dead."

"And a priest, too, I suppose," said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner. "All these Champions
are papists."

The American knelt down by the body, felt the heart, propped up the head and used some last
efforts at restoration; but before the other journalist reappeared, followed by a doctor and
a priest, he was already prepared to assert they were too late.

"Were you too late also?" asked the doctor, a solid prosperous-looking man, with conventional
moustache and whiskers, but a lively eye, which darted over Kidd dubiously.

"In one sense," drawled the representative of the Sun. "I was too late to save the man, but

"My husband is at home," she said. "He has nothing to do with this."

Again he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him, with a curiously intense expression
on her face.

"Shall I tell you something more?" she said, with a rather fearful smile. "I don't think he
did it, and you don't either." Father Brown returned her gaze with a long, grave stare, and
then nodded, yet more gravely.

"Father Brown," said the lady, "I am going to tell you all I know, but I want you to do me
a favour first. Will you tell me why you haven't jumped to the conclusion of poor John's guilt,
as all the rest have done? Don't mind what you say: I--I know about the gossip and the appearances
that are against me."

Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed, and passed his hand across his forehead. "Two very
little things," he said. "At least, one's very trivial and the other very vague. But such as
they are, they don't fit in with Mr Boulnois being the murderer."

He turned his blank, round face up to the stars and continued absentmindedly: "To take the
vague idea first. I attach a good deal of importance to vague ideas. All those things that
'aren't evidence' are what convince me. I think a moral impossibility the biggest of all impossibilities.
I know your husband only slightly, but I think this crime of his, as generally conceived, something
very like a moral impossibility. Please do not think I mean that Boulnois could not be so wicked.
Anybody can be wicked--as wicked as he chooses. We can direct our moral wills; but we can't
generally change our instinctive tastes and ways of doing things. Boulnois might commit a murder,
but not this murder. He would not snatch Romeo's sword from its romantic scabbard; or slay
his foe on the sundial as on a kind of altar; or leave his body among the roses, or fling the
sword away among the pines. If Boulnois killed anyone he'd do it quietly and heavily, as he'd
do any other doubtful thing--take a tenth glass of port, or read a loose Greek poet. No, the
romantic setting is not like Boulnois. It's more like Champion."

"Ah!" she said, and looked at him with eyes like diamonds.

"And the trivial thing was this," said Brown. "There were finger-prints on that sword; finger-prints
can be detected quite a time after they are made if they're on some polished surface like glass
or steel. These were on a polished surface. They were half-way down the blade of the sword.
Whose prints they were I have no earthly clue; but why should anybody hold a sword half-way
down? It was a long sword, but length is an advantage in lunging at an enemy. At least, at
most enemies. At all enemies except one."

"Except one," she repeated.

"There is only one enemy," said Father Brown, "whom it is easier to kill with a dagger than
a sword."

"I know," said the woman. "Oneself."

There was a long silence, and then the priest said quietly but abruptly: "Am I right, then?
Did Sir Claude kill himself?"

"Yes" she said, with a face like marble. "I saw him do it."

"He died," said Father Brown, "for love of you?"

An extraordinary expression flashed across her face, very different from pity, modesty, remorse,
or anything her companion had expected: her voice became suddenly strong and full. "I don't
believe," she said, "he ever cared about me a rap. He hated my husband."

"Why?" asked the other, and turned his round face from the sky to the lady.

"He hated my husband because...it is so strange I hardly know how to say it...because..."

"Yes?" said Brown patiently.

"Because my husband wouldn't hate him."

Father Brown only nodded, and seemed still to be listening; he differed from most detectives
in fact and fiction in a small point--he never pretended not to understand when he understood
perfectly well.

Mrs Boulnois drew near once more with the same contained glow of certainty. "My husband," she
said, "is a great man. Sir Claude Champion was not a great man: he was a celebrated and successful
man. My husband has never been celebrated or successful; and it is the solemn truth that he
has never dreamed of being so. He no more expects to be famous for thinking than for smoking
cigars. On all that side he has a sort of splendid stupidity. He has never grown up. He still
liked Champion exactly as he liked him at school; he admired him as he would admire a conjuring
trick done at the dinner-table. But he couldn't be got to conceive the notion of envying Champion.
And Champion wanted to be envied. He went mad and killed himself for that."

"Yes," said Father Brown; "I think I begin to understand."

"Oh, don't you see?" she cried; "the whole picture is made for that--the place is planned for
it. Champion put John in a little house at his very door, like a dependant--to make him feel
a failure. He never felt it. He thinks no more about such things than--than an absent-minded
lion. Champion would burst in on John's shabbiest hours or homeliest meals with some dazzling
present or announcement or expedition that made it like the visit of Haroun Alraschid, and
John would accept or refuse amiably with one eye off, so to speak, like one lazy schoolboy
agreeing or disagreeing with another. After five years of it John had not turned a hair; and
Sir Claude Champion was a monomaniac."

"And Haman began to tell them," said Father Brown, "of all the things wherein the king had
honoured him; and he said: 'All these things profit me nothing while I see Mordecai the Jew
sitting in the gate.'"

"The crisis came," Mrs Boulnois continued, "when I persuaded John to let me take down some
of his speculations and send them to a magazine. They began to attract attention, especially
in America, and one paper wanted to interview him. Formerly who swithun'Case location than the

When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy dog, a small and neat maid-servant
showed him into the dining-room, where Boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp, exactly as his
wife described him. A decanter of port and a wineglass were at his elbow; and the instant the
priest entered he noted the long ash stand out unbroken on his cigar.

"He has been here for half an hour at least," thought Father Brown. In fact, he had the air
of sitting where he had sat when his dinner was cleared away.

"Don't get up, Mr Boulnois," said the priest in his pleasant, prosaic way. "I shan't interrupt
you a moment. I fear I break in on some of your scientific studies."

"No," said Boulnois; "I was reading 'The Bloody Thumb.'" He said it with neither frown nor
smile, and his visitor was conscious of a certain deep and virile indifference in the man which
his wife had called greatness. He laid down a gory yellow "shocker" without even feeling its
incongruity enough to comment on it humorously. John Boulnois was a big, slow-moving man with
a massive head, partly grey and partly bald, and blunt, burly features. He was in shabby and
very old-fashioned evening-dress, with a narrow triangular opening of shirt-front: he had assumed
it that evening in his original purpose of going to see his wife act Juliet.

"I won't keep you long from 'The Bloody Thumb' or any other catastrophic affairs," said Father
Brown, smiling. "I only came to ask you about the crime you committed this evening."

Boulnois looked at him steadily, but a red bar began to show across his broad brow; and he
seemed like one discovering embarrassment for the first time.

"I know it was a strange crime," assented Brown in a low voice. "Stranger than murder perhaps--to
you. The little sins are sometimes harder to confess than the big ones--but that's why it's
so important to confess them. Your crime is committed by every fashionable hostess six times
a week: and yet you find it sticks to your tongue like a nameless atrocity."

"It makes one feel," said the philosopher slowly, "such a damned fool."

"I know," assented the other, "but one often has to choose between feeling a damned fool and
being one."

"I can't analyse myself well," went on Boulnois; "but sitting in that chair with that story
I was as happy as a schoolboy on a half-holiday. It was security, eternity--I can't convey
it... the cigars were within reach...the matches were within reach... the Thumb had four more
appearances to...it was not only a peace, but a plenitude. Then that bell rang, and I thought
for one long, mortal minute that I couldn't get out of that chair--literally, physically, muscularly
couldn't. Then I did it like a man lifting the world, because I knew all the servants were
out. I opened the front door, and there was a little man with his mouth open to speak and his
notebook open to write in. I remembered the Yankee interviewer I had forgotten. His hair was
parted in the middle, and I tell you that murder--"

"I understand," said Father Brown. "I've seen him."

"I didn't commit murder," continued the Catastrophist mildly, "but only perjury. I said I had
gone across to Pendragon Park and shut the door in his face. Into the bewilderment of a restoration

The apprehension has been carried with archaeologists that this renovation will have cubic results,

TWELVE -- The Fairy Tale of Father Brown

THE picturesque city and state of Heiligwaldenstein was one of those toy kingdoms of which
certain parts of the German Empire still consist. It had come under the Prussian hegemony quite
late in history--hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and Father Brown
found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer. There had been not a little
of war and wild justice there within living memory, as soon will be shown. But in merely looking
at it one could not dismiss that impression of childishness which is the most charming side
of Germany--those little pantomime, paternal monarchies in which a king seems as domestic as
a cook. The German soldiers by the innumerable sentry-boxes looked strangely like German toys,
and the clean-cut battlements of the castle, gilded by the sunshine, looked the more like the
gilt gingerbread. For it was brilliant weather. The sky was as Prussian a blue as Potsdam itself
could require, but it was yet more like that lavish and glowing use of the colour which a child
extracts from a shilling paint-box. Several delightful tops can be postdate in what had the way has

.
 The populace had been supposed to be disarmed ever since the suppression of the revolt,
but Otto now insisted, as governments very seldom insist, on an absolute and literal disarmament.
It was carried out, with extraordinary thoroughness and severity, by very well-organized officials
over a small and familiar area, and, so far as human strength and science can be absolutely
certain of anything, Prince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much
as a toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein."

"Human science can never be quite certain of things like that," said Father Brown, still looking
at the red budding of the branches over his head, "if only because of the difficulty about
definition and connotation. What is a weapon? People have been murdered with the mildest domestic
comforts; certainly with tea-kettles, probably with tea-cosies. On the other hand, if you showed
an Ancient Briton a revolver, I doubt if he would know it was a weapon--until it was fired
into him, of course. Perhaps somebody introduced a firearm so new that it didn't even look
like a firearm. Perhaps it looked like a thimble or something. Was the bullet at all peculiar?"

"Not that I ever heard of," answered Flambeau; "but my information is fragmentary, and only
comes from my old friend Grimm. He was a very able detective in the German service, and he
tried to arrest me; I arrested him instead, and we had many interesting chats. He was in charge
here of the inquiry about Prince Otto, but I forgot to ask him anything about the bullet. According
to Grimm, what happened was this." He paused a moment to drain the greater part of his dark
lager at a draught, and then resumed:

"On the evening in question, it seems, the Prince was expected to appear in one of the outer
rooms, because he had to receive certain visitors whom he really wished to meet. They were
geological experts sent to investigate the old question of the alleged supply of gold from
the rocks round here, upon which (as it was said) the small city-state had so long maintained
its credit and been able to negotiate with its neighbours even under the ceaseless bombardment
of bigger armies. Hitherto it had never been found by the most exacting inquiry which could--"

"Which could be quite certain of discovering a toy pistol," said Father Brown with a smile.
"But what about the brother who ratted? Hadn't he anything to tell the Prince?"

"He always asseverated that he did not know," replied Flambeau; "that this was the one secret
his brothers had not told him. It is only right to say that it received some support from fragmentary
words--spoken by the great Ludwig in the hour of death, when he looked at Heinrich but pointed
at Paul, and said, 'You have not told him...' and was soon afterwards incapable of speech.
Anyhow, the deputation of distinguished geologists and mineralogists from Paris and Berlin
were there in the most magnificent and appropriate dress, for there are no men who like wearing
their decorations so much as the men of science--as anybody knows who has ever been to a soiree
of the Royal Society. It was a brilliant gathering, but very late, and gradually the Chamberlain--you
saw his portrait, too: a man with black eyebrows, serious eyes, and a meaningless sort of smile
underneath--the Chamberlain, I say, discovered there was everything there except the Prince
himself. He searched all the outer salons; then, remembering the man's mad fits of fear, hurried
to the inmost chamber. That also was empty, but the steel turret or cabin erected in the middle
of it took some time to open. When it did open it was empty, too. He went and looked into the
hole in the ground, which seemed deeper and somehow all the more like a grave--that is his
account, of course. And even as he did so he heard a burst of cries and tumult in the long
rooms and corridors without.

"First it was a distant din and thrill of something unthinkable on the horizon of the crowd,
even beyond the castle. Next it was a wordless clamour startlingly close, and loud enough to
be distinct if each word had not killed the other. Next came words of a terrible clearness,
coming nearer, and next one man, rushing into the room and telling the news as briefly as such
news is told.

"Otto, Prince of Heiligwaldenstein and Grossenmark, was lying in the dews of the darkening
twilight in the woods beyond the castle, with his arms flung out and his face flung up to the
moon. The blood still pulsed from his shattered temple and jaw, but it was the only part of
him that moved like a living thing. He was clad in his full white and yellow uniform, as to
receive his guests within, except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay rather crumpled
by his side. Before he could be lifted he was dead. But, dead or alive, he was a riddle--he
who had always hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods, unarmed and alone."

"Who found his body?" asked Father Brown.

"Some girl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other," replied his friend,
"who had been out in the wood picking wild flowers."

"Had she picked any?" asked the priest, staring rather vacantly at the veil of the branches
above him.

"Yes," replied Flambeau. "I particularly remember that the Chamberlain, or old Grimm or somebody,
said how horrible it was, when they came up at her call, to see a girl holding spring flowers
and bending over that--that bloody collapse. However, the main point is that before help arrived
he was dead, and the news, of course, had to be carried back to the castle. The consternation
it created was something beyond even that natural in a Court at the fall of a potentate. The
foreign visitors, especially the mining experts, were in the wildest doubt and excitement,
as well as many important Prussian officials, and it soon began to be clear that the scheme
for finding the treasure bulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed. Experts
and officials had been promised great prizes or international advantages, and some even said
that the Prince's secret apartments and strong military protection were due less to fear of
the populace than to the pursuit of some private investigation of--"

"Had the flowers got long stalks?" asked Father Brown.

Flambeau stared at him. "What an odd person you are!" he said. "That's exactly what old Grimm
said. He said the ugliest part of it, he thought--uglier than the blood and bullet--was that
the flowers were quite short, plucked close under the head."

"Of course," said the priest, "when a grown up girl is really picking flowers, she picks them
with plenty of stalk. If she just pulled their heads off, as a child does, it looks as if--"
And he hesitated.

"Well?" inquired the other.

"Well, it looks rather as if she had snatched them nervously, to make an excuse for being there
after--well, after she was there."

"I know what you're driving at," said Flambeau rather gloomily. "But that and every other suspicion
breaks down on the one point--the want of a weapon. He could have been killed, as you say,
with lots of other things--even with his own military sash; but we have to explain not how
he was killed, but how he was shot. And the fact is we can't. They had the girl most ruthlessly
searched; for, to tell the truth, she was a little suspect, though the niece and ward of the
wicked old Chamberlain, Paul Arnhold. But she was very romantic, and was suspected of sympathy
with the old revolutionary enthusiasm in her family. All the same, however romantic you are,
you can't imagine a big bullet into a man's jaw or brain without using a gun or pistol. And
there was no pistol, though there were two pistol shots. I leave it to you, my friend."

"How do you know there were two shots?" asked the little priest.

"There was only one in his head," said his companion, "but there was another bullet-hole in
the sash."

Father Brown's smooth brow became suddenly constricted. "Was the other bullet found?" he demanded.

Flambeau started a little. "I don't think I remember," he said.

"Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!" cried Brown, frowning more and more, with a quite unusual concentration
of curiosity. "Don't think me rude. Let me think this out for a moment."

"All right," said Flambeau, laughing, and finished his beer. A slight breeze stirred the budding
trees and blew up into the sky cloudlets of white and pink that seemed to make the sky bluer
and the whole coloured scene more quaint. They might have been cherubs flying home to the casements
of a sort of celestial nursery. The oldest tower of the castle, the Dragon Tower, stood up
as grotesque as the ale-mug, but as homely. Only beyond the tower glimmered the wood in which
the man had lain dead.

"What became of this Hedwig eventually?" asked the priest at last.

"She is married to General Schwartz," said Flambeau. "No doubt you've heard of his career,
which was rather romantic. He had distinguished himself even, before his exploits at Sadowa
and Gravelotte; in fact, he rose from the ranks, which is very unusual even in the smallest
of the German..." 

At the cognition of each boom is a raft which back two large windlasses,
each of which act an hook.

A guard is ever much larger than the boom said of logarithm, so that the
sharpness of the boom may be alter for astray but wide humor.

"What do you mean?" demanded the other. "In what way did they kill the man?"

"They killed him with the sash," said Brown carefully; and then, as Flambeau protested: "Yes,
yes, I know about the bullet. Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash. I know it doesn't
sound like having a disease."

"I suppose," said Flambeau, "that you've got some notion in your head, but it won't easily
get the bullet out of his. As I explained before, he might easily have been strangled. But
he was shot. By whom? By what?"

"He was shot by his own orders," said the priest.

"You mean he committed suicide?"

"I didn't say by his own wish," replied Father Brown. "I said by his own orders."

"Well, anyhow, what is your theory?"

Father Brown laughed. "I am only on my holiday," he said. "I haven't got any theories. Only
this place reminds me of fairy stories, and, if you like, I'll tell you a story."

The little pink clouds, that looked rather like sweet-stuff, had floated up to crown the turrets
of the gilt gingerbread castle, and the pink baby fingers of the budding trees seemed spreading
and stretching to reach them; the blue sky began to take a bright violet of evening, when Father
Brown suddenly spoke again:

"It was on a dismal night, with rain still dropping from the trees and dew already clustering,
that Prince Otto of Grossenmark stepped hurriedly out of a side door of the castle and walked
swiftly into the wood. One of the innumerable sentries saluted him, but he did not notice it.
He had no wish to be specially noticed himself. He was glad when the great trees, grey and
already greasy with rain, swallowed him up like a swamp. He had deliberately chosen the least
frequented side of his palace, but even that was more frequented than he liked. The high to spirits

 On the small rock platform stood an old bronze lectern or reading-stand,
groaning under a great German Bible. The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating
airs of that exalted place, and Otto had instantly the thought, 'Even if they had arms, they
must be rusted by now.' Moonrise had already made a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags,
and the rain had ceased.

"Behind the lectern, and looking across the valley, stood a very old man in a black robe that
fell as straight as the cliffs around him, but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike
to waver in the wind. He was evidently reading some daily lesson as part of his religious exercises.
'They trust in their horses...'

"'Sir,' said the Prince of Heiligwaldenstein, with quite unusual courtesy, 'I should like only
one word with you.'

"'...and in their chariots,' went on the old man weakly, 'but we will trust in the name of
the Lord of Hosts....' His last words were inaudible, but he closed the book reverently and,
being nearly blind, made a groping movement and gripped the reading-stand. Instantly his two
servants slipped out of the low-browed cavern and supported him. They wore dull-black gowns
like his own, but they had not the frosty silver on the hair, nor the frost-bitten refinement
of the features. They were peasants, Croat or Magyar, with broad, blunt visages and blinking
eyes. For the first time something troubled the Prince, but his courage and diplomatic sense
stood firm.

"'I fear we have not met,' he said, 'since that awful cannonade in which your poor brother died.'

"'All my brothers died,' said the old man, still looking across the valley. Then, for one instant
turning on Otto his drooping, delicate features, and the wintry hair that seemed to drip over
his eyebrows like icicles, he added: 'You see, I am dead, too.'

"'I hope you'll understand,' said the Prince, controlling himself almost to a point of conciliation,
'that I do not come here to haunt you, as a mere ghost of those great quarrels. We will not
talk about who was right or wrong in that, but at least there was one point on which we were
never wrong, because you were always right. Whatever is to be said of the policy of your family,
no one for one moment imagines that you were moved by the mere gold; you have proved yourself
above the suspicion that...'

"The old man in the black gown had hitherto continued to gaze at him with watery blue eyes
and a sort of weak wisdom in his face. But when the word 'gold' was said he held out his hand
as if in arrest of something, and turned away his face to the mountains.

"'He has spoken of gold,' he said. 'He has spoken of things not lawful. Let him cease to speak.'

"Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition, which is to regard success not as an
incident but as a quality. He conceived himself and his like as perpetually conquering peoples
who were perpetually being conquered. Consequently, he was ill acquainted with the emotion
of surprise, and ill prepared for the next movement, which startled and stiffened him. He had
opened his mouth to answer the hermit, when the mouth was stopped and the voice strangled by
a strong, soft gag suddenly twisted round his head like a tourniquet. It was fully forty seconds
before he even realized that the two Hungarian servants had done it, and that they had done
it with his own military scarf.

"The old man went again weakly to his great brazen-supported Bible, turned over the leaves,
with a patience that had something horrible about it, till he came to the Epistle of St James,
and then began to read: 'The tongue is a little member, but--'

"Something in the very voice made the Prince turn suddenly and plunge down the mountain-path
he had climbed. He was half-way towards the gardens of the palace before he even tried to tear
the strangling scarf from his neck and jaws. He tried again and again, and it was impossible;
the men who had knotted that gag knew the difference between what a man can do with his hands
in front of him and what he can do with his hands behind his head. His legs were free to leap
like an antelope on the mountains, his arms were free to use any gesture or wave any signal,
but he could not speak. A dumb devil was in him.

"He had come close to the woods that walled in the castle before he had quite realized what
his wordless state meant and was meant to mean. Once more he looked down grimly at the bright,
square labyrinths of the lamp-lit city below him, and he smiled no more. He felt himself repeating
the phrases of his former mood with a murderous irony. Far as the eye could see ran the rifles
of his friends, every one of whom would shoot him dead if he could not answer the challenge.
Rifles were so near that the wood and ridge could be patrolled at regular intervals; therefore
it was useless to hide in the wood till morning. Southerly toward Harare is not the pleasant and big

 Otto of Grossenmark lay very peacefully
among the fairy trees, and would do no more harm either with gold or steel; only the silver
pencil of the moon would pick out and trace here and there the intricate ornament of his uniform,
or the old wrinkles on his brow. May God have mercy on his soul.

"The sentry who had fired, according to the strict orders of the garrison, naturally ran forward
to find some trace of his quarry. He was a private named Schwartz, since not unknown in his
profession, and what he found was a bald man in uniform, but with his face so bandaged by a
kind of mask made of his own military scarf that nothing but open, dead eyes could be seen,
glittering stonily in the moonlight. The bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw; that
is why there was a shot-hole in the scarf, but only one shot. Naturally, if not correctly,
young Schwartz tore off the mysterious silken mask and cast it on the grass; and then he saw
whom he had slain.

"We cannot be certain of the next phase. But I incline to believe that there was a fairy tale,
after all, in that little wood, horrible as was its occasion. Whether the young lady named
Hedwig had any previous knowledge of the soldier she saved and eventually married, or whether
she came accidentally upon the accident and their intimacy began that night, we shall probably
never know. But we can know, I fancy, that this Hedwig was a heroine, and deserved to marry
a man who became something of a hero. She did the bold and the wise thing. She persuaded the
sentry to go back to his post, in which place there was nothing to connect him with the disaster;
he was but one of the most loyal and orderly of fifty such sentries within call. She remained
by the body and gave the alarm; and there was nothing to connect her with the disaster either,
since she had not got, and could not have, any firearms.

"Well," said Father Brown rising cheerfully "I hope they're happy."

"Where are you going?" asked his friend.

"I'm going to have another look at that portrait of the Chamberlain, the Arnhold who betrayed
his brethren," answered the priest. "I wonder what part--I wonder if a man is less a traitor
when he is twice a traitor?"

And he ruminated long before the portrait of a white-haired man with black eyebrows and a pink,
painted sort of smile that seemed to contradict the black warning in his eyes.
