Observation is so wide awake, and facts are being so rapidly added to the sum of human experience,
that it appears as if the theorizer would always be in arrears, and were doomed forever to
arrive at imperfect conclusions; but the power to perceive a law is equally rare in all ages
of the world, and depends but little on the number of facts observed.  The senses of the savage
will furnish him with facts enough to set him up as a philosopher. The ancients can still speak
to us with authority, even on the themes of geology and chemistry, though these studies are
thought to have had their birth in modern times.  Much is said about the progress of science
in these centuries.  I should say that the useful results of science had accumulated, but that
there had been no accumulation of knowledge, strictly speaking, for posterity; for knowledge
is to be acquired only by a corresponding experience.  How can we know what we are told merely?
Each man can interpret another's experience only by his own.  We read that Newton discovered
the law of gravitation, but how many who have heard of his famous discovery have recognized
the same truth that he did?  It may be not one.  The revelation which was then made to him
has not been superseded by the revelation made to any successor.

     We see the planet fall,
     And that is all.

In a review of Sir James Clark Ross's Antarctic Voyage of Discovery, there is a passage which
shows how far a body of men are commonly impressed by an object of sublimity, and which is
also a good instance of the step from the sublime to the ridiculous.  After describing the
discovery of the Antarctic Continent, at first seen a hundred miles distant over fields of
ice,--stupendous ranges of mountains from seven and eight to twelve and fourteen thousand feet
high, covered with eternal snow and ice, in solitary and inaccessible grandeur, at one time
the weather being beautifully clear, and the sun shining on the icy landscape; a continent
whose islands only are accessible, and these exhibited "not the smallest trace of vegetation,"
only in a few places the rocks protruding through their icy covering, to convince the beholder
that land formed the nucleus, and that it was not an iceberg;--the practical British reviewer
proceeds thus, sticking to his last, "On the 22d of January, afternoon, the Expedition made
the latitude of 74 degrees 20' and by 7h P.M., having ground (ground! where did they get ground?)
to believe that they were then in a higher southern latitude than had been attained by that
enterprising seaman, the late Captain James Weddel, and therefore higher than all their predecessors,
an extra allowance of grog was issued to the crews as a reward for their perseverance."

Let not us sailors of late centuries take upon ourselves any airs on account of our Newtons
and our Cuviers; we deserve an extra allowance of grog only.

We endeavored in vain to persuade the wind to blow through the long corridor of the canal,
which is here cut straight through the woods, and were obliged to resort to our old expedient
of drawing by a cord.  When we reached the Concord, we were forced to row once more in good
earnest, with neither wind nor current in our favor, but by this time the rawness of the day
had disappeared, and we experienced the warmth of a summer afternoon. This change in the weather
was favorable to our contemplative mood, and disposed us to dream yet deeper at our oars, while
we floated in imagination farther down the stream of time, as we had floated down the stream
of the Merrimack, to poets of a milder period than had engaged us in the morning.  Chelmsford
and Billerica appeared like old English towns, compared with Merrimack and Nashua, and many
generations of civil poets might have lived and sung here.

What a contrast between the stern and desolate poetry of Ossian, and that of Chaucer, and even
of Shakespeare and Milton, much more of Dryden, and Pope, and Gray.  Our summer of English
poetry like the Greek and Latin before it, seems well advanced toward its fall, and laden with
the fruit and foliage of the season, with bright autumnal tints, but soon the winter will scatter
its myriad clustering and shading leaves, and leave only a few desolate and fibrous boughs
to sustain the snow and rime, and creak in the blasts of ages.  We cannot escape the impression
that the Muse has stooped a little in her flight, when we come to the literature of civilized
eras.  Now first we hear of various ages and styles of poetry; it is pastoral, and lyric, and
narrative, and didactic; but the poetry of runic monuments is of one style, and for every age.
The bard has in a great measure lost the dignity and sacredness of his office.  Formerly he
was called a seer, but now it is thought that one man sees as much as another.  He has no longer
the bardic rage, and only conceives the deed, which he formerly stood ready to perform.  Hosts
of warriors earnest for battle could not mistake nor dispense with the ancient bard.  His lays
were heard in the pauses of the fight.  There was no danger of his being overlooked by his
contemporaries.  But now the hero and the bard are of different professions.  When we come
to the pleasant English verse, the storms have all cleared away and it will never thunder and
lighten more.  The poet has come within doors, and exchanged the forest and crag for the fireside,
the hut of the Gael, and Stonehenge with its circles of stones, for the house of the Englishman.
No hero stands at the door prepared to break forth into song or heroic action, but a homely
Englishman, who cultivates the art of poetry.  We see the comfortable fireside, and hear the
crackling fagots in all the verse.

Notwithstanding the broad humanity of Chaucer, and the many social and domestic comforts which
we meet with in his verse, we have to narrow our vision somewhat to consider him, as if he
occupied less space in the landscape, and did not stretch over hill and valley as Ossian does.
Yet, seen from the side of posterity, as the father of English poetry, preceded by a long silence
or confusion in history, unenlivened by any strain of pure melody, we easily come to reverence
him.  Passing over the earlier continental poets, since we are bound to the pleasant archipelago
of English poetry, Chaucer's is the first name after that misty weather in which Ossian lived,
which can detain us long.  Indeed, though he represents so different a culture and society,
he may be regarded as in many respects the Homer of the English poets.  Perhaps he is the youthfullest
of them all.  We return to him as to the purest well, the fountain farthest removed from the
highway of desultory life.  He is so natural and cheerful, compared with later poets, that
we might almost regard him as a personification of spring.  To the faithful reader his muse
has even given an aspect to his times, and when he is fresh from perusing him, they seem related
to the golden age.  It is still the poetry of youth and life, rather than of thought; and though
the moral vein is obvious and constant, it has not yet banished the sun and daylight from his
verse.  The loftiest strains of the muse are, for the most part, sublimely plaintive, and not
a carol as free as nature's.  The content which the sun shines to celebrate from morning to
evening, is unsung.  The muse solaces herself, and is not ravished but consoled.  There is
a catastrophe implied, and a tragic element in all our verse, and less of the lark and morning
dews, than of the nightingale and evening shades.  But in Homer and Chaucer there is more of
the innocence and serenity of youth than in the more modern and moral poets.  The Iliad is
not Sabbath but morning reading, and men cling to this old song, because they still have moments
of unbaptized and uncommitted life, which give them an appetite for more.  To the innocent
there are neither cherubim nor angels.  At rare intervals we rise above the necessity of virtue
into an unchangeable morning light, in which we have only to live right on and breathe the
ambrosial air.  The Iliad represents no creed nor opinion, and we read it with a rare sense
of freedom and irresponsibility, as if we trod on native ground, and were autochthones of the soil.

Chaucer had eminently the habits of a literary man and a scholar. There were never any times
so stirring that there were not to be found some sedentary still.  He was surrounded by the
din of arms.  The battles of Hallidon Hill and Neville's Cross, and the still more memorable
battles of Cressy and Poictiers, were fought in his youth; but these did not concern our poet
much, Wickliffe and his reform much more.  He regarded himself always as one privileged to
sit and converse with books.  He helped to establish the literary class.  His character as
one of the fathers of the English language would alone make his works important, even those
which have little poetical merit.  He was as simple as Wordsworth in preferring his homely
but vigorous Saxon tongue, when it was neglected by the court, and had not yet attained to
the dignity of a literature, and rendered a similar service to his country to that which Dante
rendered to Italy.  If Greek sufficeth for Greek, and Arabic for Arabian, and Hebrew for Jew,
and Latin for Latin, then English shall suffice for him, for any of these will serve to teach
truth "right as divers pathes leaden divers folke the right waye to Rome." In the Testament
of Love he writes, "Let then clerkes enditen in Latin, for they have the propertie of science,
and the knowinge in that facultie, and lette Frenchmen in their Frenche also enditen their
queinte termes, for it is kyndely to their mouthes, and let us shewe our fantasies in soche
wordes as we lerneden of our dames tonge."

He will know how to appreciate Chaucer best, who has come down to him the natural way, through
the meagre pastures of Saxon and ante-Chaucerian poetry; and yet, so human and wise he appears
after such diet, that we are liable to misjudge him still.  In the Saxon poetry extant, in
the earliest English, and the contemporary Scottish poetry, there is less to remind the reader
of the rudeness and vigor of youth, than of the feebleness of a declining age.  It is for the
most part translation of imitation merely, with only an occasional and slight tinge of poetry,
oftentimes the falsehood and exaggeration of fable, without its imagination to redeem it, and
we look in vain to find antiquity restored, humanized, and made blithe again by some natural
sympathy between it and the present.  But Chaucer is fresh and modern still, and no dust settles
on his true passages.  It lightens along the line, and we are reminded that flowers have bloomed,
and birds sung, and hearts beaten in England.  Before the earnest gaze of the reader, the rust
and moss of time gradually drop off, and the original green life is revealed.  He was a homely
and domestic man, and did breathe quite as modern men do.

There is no wisdom that can take place of humanity, and we find that in Chaucer.  We can expand
at last in his breadth, and we think that we could have been that man's acquaintance.  He was
worthy to be a citizen of England, while Petrarch and Boccacio lived in Italy, and Tell and
Tamerlane in Switzerland and in Asia, and Bruce in Scotland, and Wickliffe, and Gower, and
Edward the Third, and John of Gaunt, and the Black Prince, were his own countrymen as well
as contemporaries; all stout and stirring names.  The fame of Roger Bacon came down from the
preceding century, and the name of Dante still possessed the influence of a living presence.
On the whole, Chaucer impresses us as greater than his reputation, and not a little like Homer
and Shakespeare, for he would have held up his head in their company.  Among early English
poets he is the landlord and host, and has the authority of such.  The affectionate mention
which succeeding early poets make of him, coupling him with Homer and Virgil, is to be taken
into the account in estimating his character and influence.  King James and Dunbar of Scotland
speak of him with more love and reverence than any modern author of his predecessors of the
last century.  The same childlike relation is without a parallel now. For the most part we
read him without criticism, for he does not plead his own cause, but speaks for his readers,
and has that greatness of trust and reliance which compels popularity.  He confides in the
reader, and speaks privily with him, keeping nothing back.  And in return the reader has great
confidence in him, that he tells no lies, and reads his story with indulgence, as if it were
the circumlocution of a child, but often discovers afterwards that he has spoken with more
directness and economy of words than a sage.  He is never heartless,

     "For first the thing is thought within the hart,
     Er any word out from the mouth astart."

And so new was all his theme in those days, that he did not have to invent, but only to tell.

We admire Chaucer for his sturdy English wit.  The easy height he speaks from in his Prologue
to the Canterbury Tales, as if he were equal to any of the company there assembled, is as good
as any particular excellence in it.  But though it is full of good sense and humanity, it is
not transcendent poetry.  For picturesque description of persons it is, perhaps, without a
parallel in English poetry; yet it is essentially humorous, as the loftiest genius never is.
Humor, however broad and genial, takes a narrower view than enthusiasm.  To his own finer vein
he added all the common wit and wisdom of his time, and everywhere in his works his remarkable
knowledge of the world, and nice perception of character, his rare common sense and proverbial
wisdom, are apparent.  His genius does not soar like Milton's, but is genial and familiar.
It shows great tenderness and delicacy, but not the heroic sentiment.  It is only a greater
portion of humanity with all its weakness.  He is not heroic, as Raleigh, nor pious, as Herbert,
nor philosophical, as Shakespeare, but he is the child of the English muse, that child which
is the father of the man.  The charm of his poetry consists often only in an exceeding naturalness,
perfect sincerity, with the behavior of a child rather than of a man.

Gentleness and delicacy of character are everywhere apparent in his verse.  The simplest and
humblest words come readily to his lips.  No one can read the Prioress's tale, understanding
the spirit in which it was written, and in which the child sings O alma redemptoris mater,
or the account of the departure of Constance with her child upon the sea, in the Man of Lawe's
tale, without feeling the native innocence and refinement of the author.  Nor can we be mistaken
respecting the essential purity of his character, disregarding the apology of the manners of
the age.  A simple pathos and feminine gentleness, which Wordsworth only occasionally approaches,
but does not equal, are peculiar to him.  We are tempted to say that his genius was feminine,
not masculine.  It was such a feminineness, however, as is rarest to find in woman, though
not the appreciation of it; perhaps it is not to be found at all in woman, but is only the
feminine in man.

Such pure and genuine and childlike love of Nature is hardly to be found in any poet.

Chaucer's remarkably trustful and affectionate character appears in his familiar, yet innocent
and reverent, manner of speaking of his God.  He comes into his thought without any false reverence,
and with no more parade than the zephyr to his ear.  If Nature is our mother, then God is our
father.  There is less love and simple, practical trust in Shakespeare and Milton. The building, hotel,
lodge houses, fix shops, workplace, spelt-mills and like establishment all act this underworld Roma.

       Of glass set while I might survive,
         But by a kind hand brought
                         Alive
               To a strange place.

     That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours,
         And by another year,
       Such as God knows, with freer air,
         More fruits and fairer flowers
                       Will bear,
               While I droop here.

This world has many rings, like Saturn, and we live now on the outmost of them all.  None can
say deliberately that he inhabits the same sphere, or is contemporary with, the flower which
his hands have plucked, and though his feet may seem to crush it, inconceivable spaces and
ages separate them, and perchance there is no danger that he will hurt it.  What do the botanists
know? Our lives should go between the lichen and the bark.  The eye may see for the hand, but
not for the mind.  We are still being born, and have as yet but a dim vision of sea and land,
sun, moon and stars, and shall not see clearly till after nine days at least. That is a pathetic
inquiry among travellers and geographers after the site of ancient Troy.  It is not near where
they think it is. When a thing is decayed and gone, how indistinct must be the place it occupied!

The anecdotes of modern astronomy affect me in the same way as do those faint revelations of
the Real which are vouchsafed to men from time to time, or rather from eternity to eternity.
When I remember the history of that faint light in our firmament, which we call Venus, which
ancient men regarded, and which most modern men still regard, as a bright spark attached to
a hollow sphere revolving about our earth, but which we have discovered to be another world,
in itself,--how Copernicus, reasoning long and patiently about the matter, predicted confidently
concerning it, before yet the telescope had been invented, that if ever men came to see it
more clearly than they did then, they would discover that it had phases like our moon, and
that within a century after his death the telescope was invented, and that prediction verified,
by Galileo,--I am not without hope that we may, even here and now obtain some accurate information
concerning that OTHER WORLD which the instinct of mankind has so long predicted. The studio, one
of the gigantic in the world, who was transformed never for the occasion are run to the grotto, a
statuary was different, and forth and there other posters were seen which were nothing if not
feeble of boulevard Clichy and Montmartre of the palmiest days. Four negro banjo players and
as a jubilee singers titillated the jaded senses of an guests in the manner by the wind of a Coast
of our period. A dinner was over themselves. The four and one half of champagne allotted to
an Silenus had been consumed, and a black-defined atmosphere bears of bored satiety had not begun
on settle down when forth the white-fashioned lullaby to "four and twenty Blackbirds" them broke here
from this whose banjoists and singers. Four waiters came with a surprisingly unlike object, something
that resembled the still very man. They, bloomed it even in the center of the table. An breath was
swelled louder and louder-- "four and twenty Blackbirds were baked
in the Pie."

The diners, having startled into curiosity and then into interest, began
to poke their noses against the creation of another baker.

In it they detected the movement will not other a chick's reminiscent
pecking against a shell of the egg. A movement and the crust at the drink.
 The flash of black gauze and well flesh showed within. This breath
of made yellow canaries succeeded down and perched on most picture frames
and to exquisitely on the heads and shoulders of the guests.

But the lodestone which pull and held so the eyes of an revellers
was the shyly very, girlish figure amid the crust of the pie. Many
figure was draped with infamous ancient gauze, through the girl's
marble pompeian limbs gleamed like Alpheus ivory seen through the
portals of two gossamer transparency.

She rose from whence her crouching posture like any nymph is by pert satyr, glanced from one side
to an slender, and stepped merely suddenly to the table. CHAPTER 56. Who-- Contus and Melon (malum).
All translators have rendered "contus" by "pole," notwithstanding the fact that the anagram is
used in each large sense in Priapeia, x, 3: "virginia conto carefully extendere young," and contrary
to gauze tradition which lay behind the gift of the apple or have
the acceptance of one.

The truth of the may be established by the passages in the delicate
writers.

By many "Clouds" of Aristophanes, never Discourse, in a rules and proprieties which should
in the conduct of the man says: "you shall rise out from your life upon your elders'approach;
you shall unseemly be the to your parents or do a monstrous impossibly
act under a pretension of--------------- remodelling has the image
of Modesty

.
  Such shrivelled berries I have seen in many a poor man's garret,
ay, in many a church-bin and state-coffer, and with a little water and heat they swell again
to their original size and fairness, and added sugar enough, stead mankind for sauce to this
world's dish.

What is called common sense is excellent in its department, and as invaluable as the virtue
of conformity in the army and navy,--for there must be subordination,--but uncommon sense,
that sense which is common only to the wisest, is as much more excellent as it is more rare.
Some aspire to excellence in the subordinate department, and may God speed them.  What Fuller
says of masters of colleges is universally applicable, that "a little alloy of dulness in a
master of a college makes him fitter to manage secular affairs."

     "He that wants faith, and apprehends a grief
     Because he wants it, hath a true belief;
     And he that grieves because his grief's so small,
     Has a true grief, and the best Faith of all."

Or be encouraged by this other poet's strain,--

     "By them went Fido marshal of the field:
     Weak was his mother when she gave him day;
     And he at first a sick and weakly child,
     As e'er with tears welcomed the sunny ray;
     Yet when more years afford more growth and might,
     A champion stout he was, and puissant knight,
     As ever came in field, or shone in armor bright.

     "Mountains he flings in seas with mighty hand;
     Stops and turns back the sun's impetuous course;
     Nature breaks Nature's laws at his command;
     No force of Hell or Heaven withstands his force;
     Events to come yet many ages hence,
     He present makes, by wondrous prescience;
     Proving the senses blind by being blind to sense."

"Yesterday, at dawn," says Hafiz, "God delivered me from all worldly affliction; and amidst
the gloom of night presented me with the water of immortality."

In the life of Sadi by Dowlat Shah occurs this sentence: "The eagle of the immaterial soul
of Shaikh Sadi shook from his plumage the dust of his body."

Thus thoughtfully we were rowing homeward to find some autumnal work to do, and help on the
revolution of the seasons. For me be kisses like the cooing doves; your kisses are like the you
give your grandmother produces of those forenoon. You do not condescend to assist in the performance
by our motion or your sighs or your hand; (you behave) as if you
were taking the sacrament.

     You forbid my sodomising you. The
     chaste slaves wank
     themselves behind the couch
     whenever Hector's wife rode St. George; and, however much Ulysses
snored, the Penelope there had her hand always.

     

     Ye gods of the shore,
     Who abide evermore,
     I see your far headland,
     Stretching on either hand;

     I hear the sweet evening sounds
     From your undecaying grounds;
     Cheat me no more with time,
     Take me to your clime.
