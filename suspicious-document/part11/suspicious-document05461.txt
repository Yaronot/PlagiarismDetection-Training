Not far off were heard the rumblings of an approaching General Election. There were the usual
flutterings of the "ins" who wanted to remain in, and of the "outs" who were anxious to taste
the social sweets and the personal pomp of the successful politician, who had got the magic
letters "M.P." to his name. It is wonderful what an appeal it makes to the man who has made
his "pile" somehow or anyhow (or who wants to make it) to have the right to enter the sacred
portals of Westminster, but it is more wonderful still to see him when he gets there become
the mere puppet of the Party Whips, without an atom of individual independence or a grain of
useful initiative. The system absorbs them and they become cogs in a machine, whose movements
they have little power of controlling or directing.

It was pretended by the leaders of the Nationalists that their subservient surrender to the
Liberal Party was a far-sighted move to compel Mr Asquith and his friends to make Home Rule
"the dominant issue," as they termed it, at the General Election. The veto of the House of
Lords, the hitherto one intractable element of opposition to Home Rule, was to go before long
and the House of Commons, within certain limits, would be in a position to impose its will
as the sovereign authority in the State. Yet it is the scarcely believable fact that in all
these precious months, and after all the servile sycophancy they had given to the Liberals,
neither Mr Redmond nor those true-blue Liberals, Mr Dillon and Mr O'Connor, had ever sought
to extract from Mr Asquith an irrefragable statement of his intentions regarding the Irish
Question, or whether he and his Government intended to make it a prime plank in the Liberal
platform at the polls. The rejection of the Budget by the Lords was made the real issue before
the electors, and little was heard of Home Rule, either on the platform or in the Press. True,
Mr Asquith made a vague and non-committal reference to it at the Albert Hall on the eve of
the election, but the Liberal candidates, with extraordinary unanimity, fought shy of it in
every constituency, except where there was a considerable Irish vote to be played up to, and
one of the Liberal Party Whips even went so far as to declare there was no Home Rule engagement
at all. Far different was it in other days, when Parnell was in power. He would have pinned
the Party to whom he was giving his support down to a written compact, which could not be broken
without dishonour, and he would leave nothing to the mere emergencies and expediencies of politics,
which are only the gambler's dice in a devil's game.

 Matters had now reached so grave a pitch that
not only were Mr O'Brien's own friends to be attacked by the "Board of Erin," which was now
in complete control of the machinery of the national organisation, but that every other Member
of Parliament who had not bent the knee to its occult omnipotence was to be run out of public
life without cause assigned. All this while there was rumour and counter-rumour about Mr O'Brien's
return. The Dillonites up to the last moment believed we were playing a game of bluff and went
on right merrily with their preparations for making a clean sweep of every man who was "suspect"
of possessing an independent mind. Then on one winter's night, shortly before the election
writs were issued, the doubters and the scoffers were once and for all confounded. Mr O'Brien
arrived in the city which was always proud to do him honour, but which never more proudly did
him honour than on this occasion, when they mustered in their thousands at the station and
lined the streets, a frantic, cheering, enthusiastic and madly joyous people, to see him back
amongst them once again, neither bent nor broken nor physically spent, but gloriously erect,
acknowledging the thunderous salutations of the tens of thousands who loved him, even to the
little children, with a love which was surely compensation for many a bitter wound of injustice
and ingratitude.

                               CHAPTER XIX

          A GENERAL ELECTION THAT LEADS TO A "HOME RULE" BILL!

It boots not to dwell at any great length on the contests that followed. Suffice it to say
that Irish manhood and Irish honesty magnificently asserted itself against the audacious and
unscrupulous tactics of the Party plotters. Mr O'Brien, by a destiny there was no resisting,
was forced into the fight in Cork City and emerged victoriously from the ordeal, as well as
winning also in North-East Cork. In my own case, except for the splendid and most generous
assistance given me by Mr Jeremiah O'Leary, the leading citizen of Macroom, who shared all
the labours and all the anxieties of my campaign, I was left to fight my battle almost single-handed,
having arrayed against me two canons of my Church and every Catholic clergyman in the constituency,
with two or three notable exceptions. The odds seemed hopeless, but the result provides the
all-sufficient answer to those who say that the Irish Catholic vote can be controlled under
all circumstances by the priests, for I scored a surprising majority of 825 in a total poll
of about 4500, and I have good reason for stating that 95 per cent. of the illiterate votes
were cast in my favour, although a most powerful personal canvass was made of every vote in
the constituency by the clergy.

I consider this incident worthy of special emphasis in view of the ignorant and malicious statements
of English and Unionist publicists, who make it a stock argument against the grant of independence
to Ireland that the Catholics will vote as they are bidden by their priests. I have sufficient
experience and knowledge of my countrymen to say that whilst in troublous times the Irish soggarths
were the natural leaders and protectors of their flocks, even to the peril of their lives,
yet in these times, when other conditions prevail, whilst in religion remaining staunchly loyal
to their faith and its teachers, when it comes to a question of political principle there is
no man in all the world who can be so independently self-assertive as the Irish Catholic. There
is nothing to fear for Ireland, either now or in the future, from what I may term clericalism
in politics, whilst on the other hand it is earnestly to be hoped that nothing will ever happen
to intrude unnecessarily the question or authority of religion in the domain of more mundane
affairs.

Mr O'Brien sums up the result of the General Election briefly thus:

"When the smoke of battle cleared away, nevertheless, every friend of mine, against whom this
pitiless cannonade of vengeance had been directed, stood victorious on the field, and it was
the conspirators who a few weeks before deemed themselves unshakable in the mastery of Ireland
who, to their almost comic bewilderment and dismay, found themselves and their boasts rolled
in the dust. Not only did every man for whose destruction they had thrown all prudence to the
winds find his way back to Parliament in their despite, but in at least eighteen other constituencies
their plots to replace members under any suspicion of independence with reliables absolutely
amenable to the signs and passwords of the Order resulted in their being blown sky-high with
their own petards.... Messrs Dillon and Devlin led their demoralised forces back, seventy in
place of eighty-three, and for the first time since 1885 they went back a minority of the Nationalist
votes actually cast as between the policy of Conciliation and the policy of Væ Victis."

Mr O'Brien had established a campaign sheet during the election called The Cork Accent (as
a sort of reminder of the "Baton" Convention, at which the order was given that no one with
a "Cork accent" should be allowed near the platform), and surely never did paper render more
brilliant service in an exceptional emergency. It was his intention that his attitude in the
new Parliament should be one of "patient observation" and of steady but unaggressive allegiance
to the principles of national reconciliation. But such a rôle was rendered impossible by the
active hostility of Mr Dillon and his followers. The doors of the Party were shut and banged
against every man who was independently elected by the voters. It was proclaimed that we would
be helpless in the country without organisation or newspaper to support us and that we would
be left even without the means of travelling to London to represent our constituents.

We could not sit inactively under this decree of annihilation. It was decided to continue The
Cork Accent in a permanent form as a daily journal under the title of The Cork Free Press,
which was founded at a public meeting presided over by the Lord Mayor. The All-for-Ireland
League was also established to advocate and expound the principles for which we stood in Irish
life. Its purposes are clearly stated in the resolution which gave it birth--viz.:

"That inasmuch as we regard self-Government in purely Irish affairs, the transfer of the soil
to the cultivators upon just terms, and the relief of Ireland from intolerable over-taxation
as essential conditions of happiness and prosperity for our country, and further inasmuch as
we believe the surest means of effecting these objects to be a combination of all the elements
of the Irish population in a spirit of mutual tolerance and patriotic good will, such as will
guarantee to the Protestant minority of our fellow-countrymen inviolable security for all their
rights and liberties and win the friendship of the entire people of Great Britain, this representative
meeting of the City and County of Cork hereby establishes an Association to be called the All-for-Ireland
League, whose primary object shall be the union and active co-operation in every department
of our national life of all Irish men and women who believe in the principle of domestic self-government
for Ireland."

The All-for-Ireland League made memorable progress in a brief space of time. Mr O'Brien's return
to public life was hailed even by the late W.T. Stead in The Westminster Gazette as nothing
short of a great political resurrection. The noble appeal of the League's programme to the
chivalrous instincts of the race attracted the young men to its side with an enthusiasm amounting
to an inspiration. The Protestant minority in Southern Ireland were being gradually won over
to a genuine confidence in our motives and generous intentions to safeguard fully their interests
and position and to secure them an adequate part in the future government of our common country.
Even the great British parties began to see in the new movement hopes of that peace and reconciliation
between Great Britain and Ireland which must be the hope of all just and broad-minded statesmanship.

It was in these circumstances that the Party surrendered "at discretion" to the expediencies
of Liberalism, abjectly waiving their position as an independent entity in Parliament, with
no shadow of the pride and spirit of the Parnell period left, seeming to exist for the favours
and bonuses that came their way, and for the rest playing to the gallery in Ireland by telling
them that Home Rule was coming "at no far distant date," and that they had only to trust to
Asquith and all would be well. Never had a Party such a combination of favourable circumstances
to command success. They possessed a strategical advantage such as Parnell would have given
his life for--they held the balance of power and they could order the Government to do their
bidding or quit. Yet instead of regarding themselves as the ambassadors of a nation claiming
its liberty they seemed to be obsessed with a criminal selfishness passing all possible belief.
When it was proposed to make Members of Parliament stipendiaries of the State, they at first
protested vehemently against the application of this principle to the Irish representatives,
and therein they were right. From a purely democratic standpoint no reasonable objection can
be urged against the payment of those who give their time and talent to the public service,
but Ireland was in different case. Her representatives were at Westminster unwillingly, not
to assist in the government of the Empire with gracious intent, but rather definitely to obstruct,
impede and hamper this government until Ireland's inalienable right to self-government was
conceded, and therefore it was their clear duty to say that they would accept payment only
from the country and the people they served and that they cast back this Treasury bribe in
the teeth of those who offered it. But having ostentatiously resolved that they would never
accept a Parliamentary stipend, they finally allowed their virtuous resistance to temptation
to be overcome and voted for "payment of members," which, without their votes, would never
have been adopted by the House of Commons. There were placemen now in Parliament, and place-hunting
was no longer a pastime to be proscribed amongst Nationalists. It may be there was no wilful
corruption in thus accepting from the common purse of the United Kingdom payment which was
made to all Members of Parliament alike, but it deprived the Irish people of control of their
representatives and handed them over to the control of the English Treasury, and thus opened
the way to the downfall of Parliamentarianism in Ireland that rapidly set in. Abandoned all
too lightly was the rigid principle that to accept favours from England was to betray Ireland,
and the pursuit of place and patronage was esteemed as not being inconsistent with a pure patriotism.

Furthermore, as if to cap the climax of their imbecilities and blunders, the Irish Party allowed
the first precious year of their mastery of Parliament to be devoted to the passage of an Insurance
Act which nobody in Ireland outside the job-seekers wanted, which every independent voice in
the country, including a unanimous Bench of Bishops, protested against, and whose only recommendation
was that it provided a regular deluge of well-paid positions for the votaries of the secret
sectarian society that had the country in its vicious grip. Such a debauch of sham Nationalism
as now ensued was never paralleled in the worst period of Ireland's history, and that this
should be done in the name of patriotism was not its least degrading feature. Nemesis could
not fail to overtake this conscious sin against the national ideal. It met with its own condign
punishment before many years were over. To show the veritable depths of baseness to which the
so-called National Movement had fallen it need only be stated that it was charged against their
official organ--The Freeman's Journal --that no less than eighteen members of its staff had
obtained positions of profit under the Crown, including a Lord Chancellorship, an Under-secretaryship,
Judgeships, Crown Prosecutorships, University Professorships, Resident Magistracies, Local
Government Inspectorships, etc. In this connection it is also worthy of mention that when the
premises of this concern were burnt out in the course of the Easter Week Rebellion it was reendowed
for "national" purposes, with a Treasury grant of £60,000, being twice the amount which the
then directors of the Freeman confessed to be the business value of the property.

Thus did the "Board of Erin" attract to its side all the most selfish and disreputable elements
in Irish Catholic life, and thus also did it repel and disgust the more broad-minded and tolerant
Protestant patriots whom the All-for-Ireland programme, under happier circumstances, would
have undoubtedly won over to the side of Home Rule. Much might even yet be forgiven to the
men who had the destiny of Ireland in their hands if they had shown any striking capacity to
exact a measure of self-government sufficiently big and broad to justify the national demand
as then understood. But they showed neither strength nor wisdom, neither courage nor sagacity
in their dealings with the English Liberal leaders and old Parliamentary hands against whom
they were pitted. They were hopelessly out-manoeuvred and overmatched at every stage of the
game. It is but just to state that the members of the Party as a whole had scarcely an atom
of responsibility for these miserable failures and defects of policy. They owed their election
to "the machine." They were the complaisant bondsmen of the secret Order. Whatever they felt
they dared not utter a word which would bring the wrath of "the Bosses" upon their heads. They
were never candidly consulted as to tactics or strategy, or even first principles.

The decisions of the little ring of three or four who dominated the situation within the Party
were sometimes, it may be, submitted to them for their formal approval, but more often than
otherwise this show of formal courtesy was not shown them. The position of Mr Redmond was most
humiliating of all. He did not lack many of the qualities which might have made for greatness
in leadership, but he did undoubtedly lack the quality of backbone and that strength of character
to assert himself and to maintain his own position without which no man can be truly considered
great. Whenever it came to an issue between them it is well known he had to submit his judgment
and to bend his will to the decision of the three others--Messrs Dillon, Devlin and T.P. O'Connor--who
must historically be held responsible for the mistakes and weaknesses and horrible blunders
of those years, which no self-respecting Irishman of the future can ever look back upon without
a shudder of horror.

The Home Rule Bill, which was the product of those shameful years of debility and disgrace,
was so poor and paltry a thing as to be almost an insult to Irish patriotism and intelligence.
It proposed to establish merely a nominal Parliament in Dublin. It was financially unsound,
besides being a denial of Ireland's right to fix and levy her own taxes. As a matter of fact,
the power of taxation was rigorously maintained at Westminster with a reduced Irish representation
of two-thirds. And this was the measure which was proclaimed to be greater than Grattan's Parliament
or than any of the previous Home Rule Bills! Furthermore, it made no provision for the completion
of land purchase, but Mr Asquith was not really to be blamed for this, as Mr Dillon proclaimed
that one of the great attractions of the Bill was that it would leave the remnant of the landlords
to be dealt with by him and his obedient henchmen. Finally, neither the Liberal Party nor their
faithful Irish supporters would hear of any concessions to Ulster.

These people were now so arrogant in the fancied security and strength of their position to
do just as they pleased that Mr Redmond rashly undertook "to put down Ulster with the strong
hand" and rather prematurely declared: "There is no longer an Ulster difficulty." One further
financial infamy the Bill perpetrated. The twenty millions sterling which were, under the Land
Purchase Act of 1903, to have been a free Imperial grant to lubricate the wheels of agrarian
settlement, was henceforth and by a "Home Rule Government" to be audaciously charged as a debt
against Ireland. And this, be it noted, was part of the pact come to with the "Nationalist"
leaders at the Downing Street breakfast-table, where Ireland's fate was sealed, and which they
joyously supported in the House of Commons against such opposition as the All-for-Ireland minority
was allowed to give it by the ruthless application of the guillotine.

The Independent Nationalist members were willing to make the best of a very "bad bargain,"
if only they could succeed in getting adopted three amendments which they regarded as vital
to the success of the measure: (1) A new financial plan; (2) the completion of land purchase,
and (3) such concessions as would win the consent of Ulster. But our reward for thus endeavouring
to make the Bill adaptable to Irish requirements and acceptable to the whole of Ireland was
to be dubbed "factionists" and "traitors" by the official Irish Party, who never once during
three years' debates in Parliament made the slightest attempt to amend or improve the Bill,
but who remained silent and impotent as graven images on the Irish benches whilst the way was
being paved for all the ruin and desolation and accumulated horrors that have since come to
Ireland through their compliant and criminal imbecility.

They had a perfect Parliamentary unity; they certainly seemed to have the most perfect understanding
with their Liberal friends, but they had no more claim to represent an independent, vigilant,
self-respecting nation than they had to represent, say, "Morocco"!

                               CHAPTER XX

                     THE RISE OF SIR EDWARD CARSON

"The question I put to myself is this: In the years of failure, where have we gone wrong? What
are the mistakes we have made? What has been the root cause of our failure? The Lord Chancellor
was perfectly frank so far as the Unionists were concerned. He said, indeed, that he was still
a Unionist, but he had come to the conclusion that the maintenance of the Union was impossible.
What lesson have we who have been Home Rulers to draw from the past? I think the mistake we
made in the beginning was that we did not sufficiently realise the absolute necessity of taking
into consideration the feeling of Ulster."

In the early stages of the opposition to Home Rule, curiously enough Sir Edward Carson did
not count as a figure of any particular power or malignancy. True, he had his early period
of notoriety in Ireland when he acted as a Crown Prosecutor under the Crimes Act. But when
he transferred his legal and political ambition to England it is alleged that he was for a
season a member of the National Liberal Club and was thus entitled to be ranked as a Liberal
in politics. Whether through conviction or otherwise, his allegiance appears to have been promptly
and permanently transferred to the Unionist Party, but even then he was in no sense regarded
as an Ulster Member--he is himself a Southern Irishman by birth--and in the House of Commons
comported himself as a good Unionist, holding office as such. It was only when the Irish Party
set their faces sternly against any concessions to Ulster that Sir Edward Carson stepped into
the breach and came to the front as the duly elected leader of the Ulster Party. It is the
sheerest nonsense and pure ignorance of the facts to say that Sir Edward Carson created the
Ulster difficulty. When the full history of this period is written, and when documents at present
confidential are available, I believe it will be shown that if the concessions and safeguards
suggested by the All-for-Ireland Party had been offered by the Government or the Irish Party
in the earlier stages of the Home Rule controversy they would have been, in the main, acceptable
to Ulster Unionist opinion. I well remember Mr (now Mr Justice) Moore declaring, from his place
on the Ulster benches:

"My friends and myself have always marvelled at the fatuity of the Irish Party in throwing
over the member for the City of Cork (Mr William O'Brien) when he had all the cards in his hands."

Where we preached all reasonable concession and conciliation our opponents proclaimed that
Ulster must submit itself unconditionally to the law and that it must content itself in the
knowledge that "minorities must suffer." And all this while the Board of Erin Hibernians were
consolidating their position as the ascendant authority in Irish life, from whom the Protestant
minority might not, without some reason, in looking back on their own bad past, expect that
it would be taken out of them when the Catholics got into power. Thus in very real fear and
terror of their disabilities under an Irish Parliament, which would be elected and dominated
by a secret sectarian organisation, they entered into the famous Ulster Covenant and solemnly
swore to resist Home Rule and to raise a Volunteer Army for the purpose of giving force and
effect to their resistance. The visit of Mr Winston Churchill to Belfast early in 1912 to address
a Nationalist meeting there was an aggravation of the situation and there was a time during
his progress through the city when his motor car was in imminent danger of being upset and
when it was surrounded by a howling and enraged mob of Orangemen, who shouted the fiercest
curses and threats at him. As a result of this experience Mr Churchill was never afterwards
a very enthusiastic supporter of what came to be called "the coercion of Ulster."

Meanwhile Mr Churchill's most ill-advised visit, from the point of view of political tactics,
was just the thing required to raise all the worst elements of Orangeism and to give its best
fillip to the signing of the Covenant, which proceeded apace, not only in Ulster, but in Great
Britain, even to the extent that the army was said to be honey-combed with sworn Covenanters,
contrary to all the rules and doctrines of military law and discipline. And in due course,
in reply to the challenge of Mr Churchill's visit the leader of the Unionist Party, Mr Bonar
Law, visited Balmoral, near Belfast, and reviewed from 80,000 to 100,000 Ulster Volunteers,
who marched past him in military order, and saluted. Sir Edward Carson made the meeting repeat
after him the pledge: "We will never in any circumstances submit to Home Rule."

The Unionist Party was now solidly and assertively on the side of Ulster in its opposition
to Home Rule. They held a demonstration at Blenheim on 27th July 1912, when some three thousand
delegates from political associations, invited by the Duke of Marlborough, were present. Mr
Bonar Law described the Liberal Ministry as a revolutionary committee which had seized by fraud
on despotic power, and declared that the Unionist Party would use whatever means seemed likely
to be most effective. He made the declaration that Ireland was two nations, a theory which,
strangely enough, Mr Lloyd George, as Coalition Premier, advocated eight years later. He went
on to say that the Ulster people would submit to no ascendancy and "he could imagine no lengths
of resistance to which they might go in which he would not be ready to support them" and in
which they would not be supported by the overwhelming majority of the British people.

In Parliament a few weeks later Mr Asquith described Mr Bonar Law's speech as a declaration
of war against Constitutional Government, but the Ulstermen went on calmly making their preparations
for levying war and Sir Edward Carson and his friends coolly delivered speeches which reeked
of sedition and treason against the State. Sir Edward Carson declared (27th July 1912): "We
will shortly challenge the Government. They shall us if they like it is treason. We are prepared
to take the consequences." And again he said (1st October 1912): "The Attorney-General says
that my doctrines and the course I am taking lead to anarchy. Does he not think I know that?"
And that fine exemplar of constitutional law, Mr F.E. Smith (now Lord Chancellor of England)
said: "Supposing the Government gave such an order the consequences can only be described in
the words of Mr Bonar Law when he said: 'If they did so it would not be a matter of argument
but the population of London would lynch you on the lamp-posts.'" Ulster scarcely needed these
incitements to encourage it in its definite purpose of armed resistance to Home Rule. It began
to organise and discipline its army of Volunteers under able military leaders who subsequently
demonstrated their capacity in no uncertain fashion, under the tests of actual warfare on many
fields of battle. With the knowledge we now possess it seems scarcely believable that Mr Redmond
and his friends should have professed to treat what was happening in Ulster as "a gigantic
game of bluff." They joked pleasantly over the drilling of the Ulster Volunteers with "wooden
guns," and they only asked that the Government should "Let the police and soldiers stand aside
and make a ring and you will hear no more of the wooden gunmen." Ribaldry and gibes of this
sort in the face of open and avowed treason was but a poor substitute for that firm statesmanship
which should have grappled with the Ulster difficulty in either of two ways--to come to terms
with it or, in the alternative, beat all unruly opposition to the ground.

Mr Asquith is blamed because he did not put the law in operation against Sir Edward Carson,
proclaim his illegal organisation of Volunteers and deal with him and his friends as a people
seditious and disaffected towards the State, who, by their acts and conduct, had invited and
merited the traitors' doom. But Mr Devlin declared not long after in Parliament that the reason
why Mr Asquith did not move was because he and his friends would not allow him. Whence this
extraordinary tenderness for the man who was thwarting and defying them at every point, it
is not possible to say. No doubt the Ministry knew themselves in the wrong in that they had
not considered the position of Ulster and had not attempted to legislate for their just fears.
It is beyond question that there were conditions upon which the consent of Ulster could have
been secured. If, these conditions being offered, this consent was unreasonably withheld, then
the Government would have been absolutely justified in throttling Sir Edward Carson's preparations
for rebellion before they had gained any ground or effective shape. But the weakness of the
Liberal-Irish position was that they would not bring themselves to admit that the All-for-Ireland
policy of Conciliation and a settlement by Conference and Consent was right.

Meanwhile, with a weak Irish administration in charge of Mr Birrell as Chief Secretary--most
amiable of litterateurs, but most imbecile of politicians--the Ulster opposition was allowed
to harden into potential violence and civil war. "Engagements" between the Orangemen and the
Hibernians began to form a sort of political amusement in the north of Ireland. The cries of
religious and race hatred were allowed to devour the sweeter gospel of reconciliation and the
recognition of a common country and that communion of right and interest between all classes
and creeds which was the evangel of Wolfe Tone and other northern Protestant patriots in sublimer
days. Matters were drifting from bad to worse under the fatal weakness and irresolution of
the Government. So little fear had Sir Edward Carson of any penal consequences to himself that
he declared, on the 7th September 1913:

"We will set up a Government [of their own as provided for in the Ulster Covenant]. I am told
it will be illegal. Of course it will. Drilling is illegal. The Government dare not interfere."

And he was right! It did not interfere. And the Ulster Volunteers began to provide themselves
with arms and ammunition and to organise themselves for actual war conditions. There were no
more feeble jokes about "wooden guns" and "making a free ring"--as if it were to be only an
ordinary pugilistic encounter and of no account. In 1913 the Ulster Volunteer Force was said
to be well armed and probably better drilled than the northern regiments at the outbreak of
the American War of Secession.

Official nationalism was, though it knew it not, passing through the gates of disaster. It
was still able to maintain its hold on the old stagers who were grafted on to it for various
reasons, and the Board of Erin was still able to count on the fidelity of those who believed
in the secret sign and watchword as the avenue to place and preferment.

The Government of Ireland Bill was merrily pursuing its three years' course through Parliament--passed
by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords after the usual farce and formality
of debates which had very little reality in them. What counted was that Ulster was in arms
and determined to resist and that "the Home Rule Government" had proved themselves incapable
either of conceding or of resisting. Other things began to count also in Ireland. The young
manhood of Nationalist Ireland, seeing the liberties of their country menaced by force, decided
to organise themselves into a corps of Irish Volunteers to defend these liberties from wanton
aggression. The Transport Workers' Strike in Dublin, in 1913, under Mr James Larkin, also showed
the existence of a powerful body of organised opinion, which cared little for ordinary political
methods and which was clearly disaffected to the Party leaders. Forces were being loosed that
had long been held in check by the power of the place-hunting and sectarian "constitutional"
movement asserting and enforcing its authority, through unscrupulous methods already described,
to speak and act on behalf of the people. If Sir Edward Carson had risen to power through open
and flagrant defiance of all constituted right and authority, there were others who were not
slow to copy his methods. The Irish Party may denounce him in Parliament as a disloyal subject
of the Crown, but there were young Nationalists in Southern Ireland, aye, even in Rebel Cork,
who sincerely raised cheers for him because he had shown them, as they believed, the better
way "to save Ireland." The Government could not make one law for the North and another for
the South. If it allowed the Orangemen to drill and arm it could not well interfere with the
Nationalists if they took a leaf out of their book and proceeded to act in like manner. And
thus are the destinies of people and the fate of nations decided. In preparing for civil war
Sir Edward Carson gave that spur of encouragement to Germany that it just needed to rush it
into a world war. And for how much else he is responsible in Ireland every faithful student
of current history knows!

                               CHAPTER XXI

               SINN FEIN--ITS ORIGINAL MEANING AND PURPOSE

Sinn Fein had a comparatively small and unimportant beginning. It was not heralded into existence
by any great flourish of trumpets nor for many years had it any considerable following among
the masses of the Nationalists. It is more than doubtful, if there had been normal political
progress in Ireland, whether Sinn Fein would ever have made itself into a great movement. It
was, in the first instance, the disappointments and humiliations which the debilitated Irish
Party had brought to the national movement and the utter disrepute into which Parliamentarianism
had fallen as a consequence that moved the thoughts of Ireland's young manhood to some nobler
and better way of serving the Motherland. But it was the rebellion of Easter Week which crystallised
and fused all these various thoughts and ideals into one direct channel of action and made
Sinn Fein the mightiest national force that has perhaps arisen in Ireland since first the English
set foot upon our shores for purposes of conquest.

Sinn Fein, as a political organisation, did not exist until 1905, but the originator of it,
Mr Arthur Griffith, had established in Dublin, in 1899, a weekly paper called The United Irishman.
This was the title of the paper which John Mitchell had founded to advocate the policy of the
Young Irelanders and was, therefore, supposed to favour to some extent a movement along those
lines. Its appeal was mainly to the young and intellectual and to those extremists who were
out of harmony with the moderate demands of the Parliamentary Party. Its first editorial gave
an index to its teachings and aims. "There exists," it declared, "has existed for centuries
and will continue to exist in Ireland a conviction hostile to the subjection or dependence
of the fortunes of this country to the necessities of any other; we intend to voice that conviction.
We bear no ill-will to any section of the Irish political body, whether its flag be green or
orange, which holds that tortuous paths are the safest for Irishmen to tread; but knowing we
are governed by a nation which religiously adheres to 'the good old rule, the simple plan,
that those may take who have the power and those may keep who can,' we, with all respect for
our friends who love the devious ways, are convinced that an occasional exhibition of the naked
truth will not shock the modesty of Irishmen and that a return to the straight road will not
lead us to political destruction.... In these later days we have been diligently taught that,
by the law of God, of Nature and of Nations, we are rightfully entitled to the establishment
in Dublin of a legislative assembly, with an expunging angel watching over its actions from
the Viceregal Lodge. We do not deprecate the institution of any such body, but we do assert
that the whole duty of an Irishman is not comprised in utilising all the forces of his nature
to procure its inception." It continued: "With the present-day movements outside politics we
are in more or less sympathy," and it particularly specified the Financial Reformers and the
Gaelic League, adding, however: "We would regret any insistence on a knowledge of Gaelic as
a test of patriotism." Finally it said: "Lest there might be any doubt in any mind, we will
say that we accept the Nationalism of '98, '48 and '67 as the true Nationalism, and Grattan's
cry 'Live Ireland. Perish the Empire' as the watchword of patriotism." Thus its creed was the
absolute independence of Ireland, and though it did not advocate the methods of armed revolution,
it opened its columns to those Nationalists who did. It preached particularly the doctrine
of self-reliance and independence. It attached more importance to moral qualities than to mere
political action. It was free in its criticism of persons or parties who it considered were
setting up false standards for the guidance of the people. It derided the policy of the Irish
Party as "half-bluster and half-whine," and when Mr Redmond spoke rhetorically of "wringing
from whatever Government may be in power the full measure of a nation's rights," it bluntly
told him he was talking "arrant humbug." It made the development of Irish industries one of
the foremost objects of its advocacy. It courageously attacked the Catholic clergy for the
faults it saw, or thought it saw, in them. They were told they took no effective steps to arrest
emigration--that they next to the British Government were responsible for the depopulation
of the country; that they failed to encourage Irish trade and manufactures and that they "made
life dull and unendurable for the people." And so on and so forth it continued its criticisms
with remarkable candour and consistency.

It came early into conflict with the Castle authorities on account of its vigorous propaganda
against recruiting for the army and it published the text of an anti-recruiting pamphlet for
the distribution of which prosecutions were instituted. It was found difficult, however, to
obtain convictions against those who distributed these pamphlets, and even in Belfast a jury
refused to bring in a conviction on this charge at the instance of the Crown. The United Irishman
was seized by the authorities and only got an excellent advertisement into the bargain.

Meanwhile an organisation of Irishmen who shared the views of the paper was being gradually
evolved, and in 1900 the first steps were taken in the foundation of Cumann na n Gaedhal. Its
objects were to advance the cause of Ireland's national independence by (1) cultivating a fraternal
spirit amongst Irishmen; (2) diffusing knowledge of Ireland's resources and supporting Irish
industries; (3) the study and teaching of Irish history, literature, language, music and art;
(4) the assiduous cultivation and encouragement of Irish games, pastimes and characteristics;
(5) the discountenancing of anything tending towards the Anglicisation of Ireland; (6) the
physical and intellectual training of the young; (7) the development of an Irish foreign policy;
(8) extending to each other friendly advice and aid, socially and politically; (9) the nationalisation
of public boards. It was felt, however, that the ends of Cumann na n Gaedhal were remote and
that something more was needed to bring the new policy into more intimate connection with political
facts. This was supplied by Mr A. Griffith when he outlined, in October, 1902, what came to
be known afterwards as the Hungarian policy. This policy was, in effect, a demand that the
members of the Irish Parliamentary should abstain from attendance at Westminster, which was
declared to be "useless, degrading and demoralising," and should adopt the policy of the Hungarian
Deputies of 1861 and, "refusing to attend the British Parliament or to recognise its right
to legislate for Ireland, remain at home to help in promoting Ireland's interests and to aid
in guarding its national rights."

A pamphlet by Mr Griffith, entitled The Resurrection of Hungary, was prepared and published,
which expounded the details of the new policy. Mr R.M. Henry, in his admirable book, The Evolution
of Sinn Fein (to which I express my indebtedness for much of what appears in this chapter),
tells us that the pamphlet, as a piece of propaganda, was a failure, and produced no immediate
or widespread response. Mr Henry also takes exception to the fact of Mr Griffith putting forward
the Hungarian policy as an original idea. "It had," he writes, "been advocated and to a certain
extent practised in Ireland long before the Hungarian Deputies adopted it," and he quotes matter
to show that Thomas Davis was the real author of the policy of Parliamentary abstention and
wonders why the credit was not given to the Irishman instead of the Hungarian Franz Deák.

The claim of Mr Griffith at this stage was that the independence of Ireland was to be based
not upon force but upon law and the constitution of 1782: "His claim was not a Republic, but
a national constitution under an Irish Crown" (Mr R.M. Henry). Finally Sinn Fein, which, literally
translated, means "Ourselves," was formally inaugurated at a meeting held in Dublin on 28th
November 1905, under the chairmanship of Mr Edward Martyn and was defined as: "National self-development
through the recognition of the rights and duties of citizenship on the part of the individual
and by the aid and support of all movements originating from within Ireland, instinct with
national tradition and not looking outside Ireland for the accomplishment of their aims."

Sinn Fein had now formally constituted itself into a distinct Party, with a definite policy
of its own, and The United Irishman ceasing to exist, a new organ was established, called Sinn
Fein. But though Mr Griffith may found a Party, he was not so fortunate in getting followers.
The Parliamentarians had not yet begun to make that mess of their position which they did so
lamentably later. That self-reliant spirit was not abroad which came when a manlier generation
arose to take their stand for Ireland.

Canon Hannay paints a peculiarly unpleasant picture of the state of Ireland at this time. "Never,"
he writes, "in her history was Ireland less inclined to self-reliance. The soul of the country
was debauched with doles and charities. An English statesman might quite truthfully have boasted
that Ireland would eat out of his hand. The only thing which troubled most of us was that the
hand, whether we licked it or snarled at it, was never full enough. The idea of self-help was
intensely unpleasant, and as for self-sacrifice!" The note of exclamation sufficiently conveys
the writer's meaning.

 The thinkers expressed the ideals of Irish nationhood; they lived them and were
even prepared to suffer for them. But the time had come when this parochialism of labour in
Ireland was to end. To the enthusiasm and impetuous force of James Larkin and the fine brain
of James Connolly Irish labour owes most for its awakening. The rise of Larkin was almost meteoric.
He was one day organising the workers of Cork into a Transport Workers Union; almost the next
he was marshalling a strike in Dublin, which made him an international democratic figure of
extraordinary power. He was a man of amazing personality, who exercised a compelling influence
over the workers. He shook them out of their deadly stupor, lectured them in a manner that
they were not accustomed to, brow-beat them and, though he made them suffer in body over the
weary months of the strike, he infused a spirit into them they had not known before. He made
the world ring with the shame of Dublin's slums and he did much to make men of those who were
little better than dumb-driven animals. He united the Capitalists of Ireland against him in
a powerful organisation, and though they broke his strike they did not break the spirit that
was behind it. Some men will say the Rebellion of Easter Week had its beginnings in the Dublin
Strike of 1913; others that Carson was the cause of it; whilst many ascribe it to the criminal
folly and short-sightedness of Redmond and his followers, who allowed British politicians to
bully and betray them at every point and made Parliamentarianism of their type intolerable
to the young soul of Ireland. History in due course will assign each its due meed of responsibility,
but of this we are certain, that the men who came out in Easter Week and bore arms were largely
the men whom Larkin had organised and whom Connolly's doctrine had influenced. From the point
of view of mental calibre Connolly was by far the abler man. He was not as well known outside
Labour circles in Dublin as he has come to be since his death, but to anyone who has given
any thought or study to his life and writings he must appear a person of single-minded purpose,
great ability, ordered methods of thought and a fine Nationalism, which was rooted in the principles
of Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen. Connolly preached the gospel of social democracy with
a fine and almost inspired fervour. He was an internationalist in the full Socialist sense,
but seeing the harrowing sights that beset him every day in the abominable slums of Dublin
City he was an Irish Reformer above all else. Mr Robert Lynd writes of him, in his Introduction
to Connolly's Labour in Ireland:

"To Connolly Dublin was in one respect a vast charnel-house of the poor. He quotes figures
showing that in 1908 the death-rate in Dublin City was 23 per 1000 as compared with a mean
death-rate of 15.8 in the seventy-six largest English towns. He then quotes other figures,
showing that while among the professional and independent classes of Dublin children under
five die at a rate of 0.9 per 1000 of the population of the class the rate among the labouring
poor is 27.7. To acquiesce in conditions such as are revealed in these figures is to be guilty
of something like child murder. We endure such things because it is the tradition of comfortable
people to endure them. But it would be impossible for any people that had its social conscience
awakened to endure them for a day. Connolly was the pioneer of the social conscience in Ireland."

In the chapter on "Labour in Dublin" Connolly himself thus refers to the Dublin Strike and
what it meant:

"Out of all this turmoil and fighting the Irish working class movement has evolved, is evolving,
amongst its members a higher conception of mutual life, a realisation of their duties to each
other and to society at large, and are thus building for the future a way that ought to gladden
the hearts of all lovers of the race. In contrast to the narrow, restricted outlook of the
Capitalist class and even of certain old-fashioned trade unionists, with their perpetual insistence
upon 'rights,' it insists, almost fiercely, that there are no rights without duties, and the
first duty is to help one another. This is, indeed, revolutionary and disturbing, but not half
as much as would be a practical following out of the moral precepts of Christianity."

Here we get some measure of the man and of his creed. To the part he played in the Easter Week
Rebellion I must refer in its own proper place. That the Dublin Strike and its consequences
had a profound effect on later events, this quotation from "Æ" will show. In a famous "open
letter" to the employers he declared:

"The men whose manhood you have broken will loathe you and will be always brooding and scheming
to strike a fresh blow. The children will be taught to curse you. The infant being moulded
in the womb will have breathed into its starved body the vitality of hate. It is not they--it
is you who are blind Samsons pulling down the pillars of the social order."

The poet oftentimes has the vision to see in clear outline what the politician and the Pharisee
cannot even glimpse.

At any rate this may be asserted, that from the year of the Dublin Strike dates the uprise
of Labour in Ireland. Connolly became a martyr for his principles, whilst Larkin has been hunted
from one end of the world to the other because of his doctrines, undoubtedly of an extremely
revolutionary character. But able men have arisen to continue the work they inaugurated and
Labour in Ireland has now formally insisted on its right to be a political Party as well as
a social organisation. It no longer circumscribes its aspirations to purely industrial issues
and social concerns, but it takes its place on the stage of larger happenings and events and
is like to play a great part in the moulding of the Ireland that will arise when the old vicious
systems and forms are shattered for evermore.

                               CHAPTER XXIII

                  CARSON, ULSTER AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

With the nearness of the time when Home Rule must automatically become law, unless something
happened to interfere, events began to move rapidly. The Tory Party, largely, I believe, through
political considerations, had unalterably taken sides with Ulster. The Liberal Party were irresolute,
wavering, pusillanimous. Mr Redmond's followers began to be uneasy--they commenced to falter
in their blind faith that they had only to trust Asquith and all would be well.

"In the Ancient Order of Hibernians," Mr Henry tells us, "all sections of Sinn Fein, as well
as the Labour Party, saw a menace to any prospect of an accommodation with Ulster. This strictly
sectarian society, as sectarian and often as violent in its methods as the Orange Lodges, evoked
their determined hostility."

"This narrowing down," wrote Irish Freedom (the organ of Mr P. H. Pearse and his friends),
"of Nationalism to the members of one creed is the most fatal thing that has taken place in
Irish politics since the days of the Pope's Brass Band," and the Ancient Order was further
referred to as "a job-getting and job-cornering organisation," as "a silent, practical riveting
of sectarianism on the nation." The Irish Worker was equally emphatic. "Were it not for the
existence of the Board of Erin the Orange Society would have long since ceased to exist. To
Brother Devlin and not to Brother Carson is mainly due the progress of the Covenanter Movement
in Ulster."

Though no doubt in Ireland religion exercises a considerable influence, it is nevertheless
a mistake to think that it was purely a question of religion with those redoubtable Northern
Unionists whom Sir Edward Carson led. They attached more importance to their political rights
and independent commercial position, which they believed to be endangered; corruption in matters
of administration was what they were most in dread of. The Irish Party used to point proudly
to the number of Protestants who had been elected as members of their Party. The reply of Ulster
was that they owed their election to their accommodating spirit in accepting the Parliamentary
policy and not because of their rigid adherence to Protestant principles.

Then came the Lame gun-running expedition, when the Fanny sailed across from Hamburg, under
the noses of English destroyers and men-of-war, and, it is said, with the knowledge and connivance
of the officers commanding them, safely landed 50,000 German rifles and several million rounds
of ammunition, which were distributed within twenty-four hours to the Covenanters throughout
the Province. It is clear that at this time extensive negotiations were going on between Germany
and the Ulster extremists. The Ulster Provisional Government were leaving nothing to chance.
History is entitled to know the full story of all that happened at this most fateful period--what
"discussions" took place between the Ulster leaders and the Kaiser, how far Sir Edward Carson
was implicated in these matters and how real and positive is his responsibility for the world
war that ensued. And it should be borne in mind that these seditious traffickings with a foreign
state were going on at a time when there was no Sinn Fein army in existence, and that the man
who first showed a readiness not alone to invoke German aid but actually to avail himself of
it, was not any Southern Nationalist rebel leader but Sir Edward Carson, the leader and, as
he was called, "the Uncrowned King" of Ulster. When critics condemn the Nationalists of the
South for their alleged communications with Germany, let them not, in all fairness, forget
Sir Edward Carson was the man who first showed the way. To whom then--if guilt there be--does
the greater guilt belong? When the news of this audacious gun-running expedition was published,
Ireland waited breathless to know what was going to happen. Warships were posted on the Ulster
coast, ostensibly to stop further gun-running, and the Prime Minister announced in the House
of Commons that "in view of this grave and unprecedented outrage the Government would take
appropriate steps without delay to vindicate the authority of the law."

But in view of what The Westminster Gazette termed "the abject surrender to the Army" of the
Government over the Curragh incident, when officers were declared to have refused to serve
against Ulster, not much in the way of stern measures was to be expected now.

As Mr Balfour was not slow in pointing out, this statement made "it impossible to coerce Ulster."
The officers who had refused to obey orders, including General Gough, were in effect patted
on the back, told they were splendid fellows, and that they would not be asked to march against
Ulster. It was the same thing over again in the case of the Fanny exploit, Sir Edward Carson
unblushingly improving the occasion by laying stress on the weakening of Great Britain's position
abroad that followed as a consequence of his own acts. The Irish Party leaders, who had a few
months before still persisted in describing the Ulster preparations as "a masquerade" and "a
sham," were now in a state of funk and panic. They found the solid ground they thought they
had stood on rapidly slipping from under them. There was to be no prosecution of the Ulster
leaders, no proclamation of their organisation, nothing to compel them to surrender the arms
they had so brazenly and illegally imported.

Why was not Carson arrested at this crisis, as he surely ought to have been by any Government
which respected its constitutional forms and authority, not to speak of its dignity? That the
Arrangements have not so, anyone in their minority of people, having pass away from property
about a Batch, but they are determined well with more sir under the fact extract of the happening. However
they, when they had been learn all, was give surely to using that
leaders and travel their order, and, having make he, having retrieve

As before, when they are not collection, but must be openly to magnify
and embroider it. "the moraine there was wholly be to leader, when

And had these column was off huge elysium, when the interviews (or King)

babu, an way to build nucleotide labour vessel or their boat, most
bid to give into it have a homo had here, and to the compartment to"
winged gallinacean and four-double animal of the saw.

"
 Mr P.H. Pearse
summed up the situation rather neatly in an article in Irish Freedom:

"One great source of misunderstanding" (he wrote) "has now disappeared; it has become clear
within the last few years that the Orangeman is no more loyal to England than we are. He wants
the Union because he imagines it secures his prosperity, but he is ready to fire on the Union
flag the moment it threatens his prosperity.... The case might be put thus: Hitherto England
has governed Ireland through the Orange Lodges--she now proposes to govern Ireland through
the Ancient Order of Hibernians. You object: so do we. Why not unite and get rid of the English?
They are the real difficulty; their presence here the real incongruity."

I quote this to show it was not the All-for-Irelanders alone who saw that the Board of Erin
was the real stumbling-block in the way of a national settlement. And now when matters were
to be put to the test the Government showed a monstrous culpability. It does not avail them
to say that the Irish Party had been guilty of treachery to Ireland, that it misled the Ministry
as to the extent and depth of Ulster's irreconcilability, and that it had betrayed its own
supporters by reposing a childish faith in Liberal promises. The Government must bear their
own responsibility for allowing Sir Edward Carson and the Ulster Covenanters to defy and thwart
them at every point, for permitting what amounted to a mutiny in the army, for ordering the
Channel Fleet and the soldiers to Ulster "to put these grave matters to the test even if the
red blood should flow," and then withdrawing them again, for issuing a proclamation forbidding
the importation of arms and allowing the Covenanters to spit at it in mockery, and finally
for admitting, in the famous Army Order I have quoted, the Right of Rebellion as part of the
constitutional machinery of the State.

"The gigantic game of bluff"--as the Ulster preparations were termed--had won outright. The
political gamesters, who would not surrender an inch to Ulster when it could be negotiated
with, were now willing to surrender everything, including the principle of an indivisible Irish
nationhood. "Conversations" between the various leaders went on during the early months of
1914 to arrange a compromise and a settlement, the gigantic crime of Partition as a substitute
for Irish Freedom was traitorously perpetrated by Ireland's own "representatives" and by the
so-called "Home Rule Government," and Ireland woke up one fine morning to find that the Home
Rule Act even when on the Statute Book might as well not be there--all the bonfires that were
lighted in Ireland to hail its enactment nothwithstanding--that "Dark Rosaleen," the mother
that they loved so well, was to be brutally dismembered, and that "A Nation Once Again" was
to mean, in the words of Sir Horace Plunkett: "Half Home Rule for three-quarters of Ireland."
The Prime Minister had proposed the partition of Ireland--three-fourths to go to the Nationalists
and one-fourth to the Orangemen--and the Irish Party had accepted the proposal, nay, more,
they summoned a Conference of Northern Nationalists and compelled them to pass a resolution,
strongly against their inclination, in favour of the proposal, under threat of the resignation
of Messrs Redmond, Dillon and Devlin if the resolution were not adopted.

An Amending Bill was immediately introduced into Parliament (23rd June 1914), which provided
for the exclusion of such Ulster counties as might avail themselves of it. This measure was
transformed by the House of Lords so as permanently to exclude the whole of Ulster from the
operations of the Home Rule Act.

By people forgetful of the facts, it is sometimes supposed that the Partition was agreed to
by the Irish Party under the pressure of war conditions. This is not so. The Party have not
even this poor excuse to justify their betrayal, which was the culminating point in the steep
declivity of their downfall. The All-for-Ireland Party resisted with all the strength at their
command the violation of Ireland's national unity. We spoke against it, voted against it, did
all we could to rouse the conscience of the people as to its unparalleled iniquity. But though
a proposal more offensive to every instinct of national feeling could not be submitted, the
Irish Party determined to see the thing through--they seemed anxious to catch at any straw
that would save them from an irretrievable doom. On account of the deadlock between the Lords
and Commons on the question of exclusion, and with a view to the adjustment of differences,
it was announced that the King had summoned a Conference of two representatives from each Party--eight
in all--to meet at Buckingham Palace. It is believed that this Conference was initiated by
His Majesty but taken with the knowledge and consent of the Ministry. Messrs Redmond and Dillon
represented the Irish Party, and thus the man (Mr Dillon) who had been for ten years denouncing
any Conference with his own countrymen went blithely into a Conference at Buckingham Palace,
where the only issue to be discussed was as to whether Sir Edward Carson should have four or
six counties for his kingdom in the North. On this point the Conference for the moment disagreed,
but nothing can ever undo the fact that a body of Irishmen claiming to be Nationalists had
not only ignobly agreed to the Partition of their native land but, after twelve months for
deliberation, agreed to surrender six counties, instead of four, to the Covenanters. And the
time came when it was remembered for them in an Ireland which had worthier concepts of Nationality
than partition and plunder.

                               CHAPTER XXIV

                FORMATION OF IRISH VOLUNTEERS AND OUTBREAK
                                  OF WAR

Meanwhile Nationalist Ireland was deep in its heart revolted by the way the Parliamentary Party
was managing its affairs. They sought still to delude it with the cry that "the Act" was on
the Statute Book and that all would be well. My experience of my own people is that once confidence
is yielded to a person or party they are trustful to an amazing degree; let that confidence
once be disturbed, then distrust and suspicion are quickly bred--and to anyone who knows the
Celtic psychology a suspicious Irishman is not a very pleasant person to deal with. This the
Party were to find out in suitable time. Meanwhile the young men of the South saw no reason
why, Ulster being armed and insolent, they might not become armed and self-reliant. And accordingly,
without any petty distinctions of party, or class, or creed, they decided to band themselves
into a body of volunteers and they adopted a title sanctioned in Irish history--namely, the
Irish Volunteers.

The movement was publicly inaugurated at a meeting held in the Rotunda, Dublin, on 25th November
1913, the leading spirits in the organisation being Captain White, D.S.O., and Sir Roger Casement,
a Northern Protestant who, knighted by England for his consular and diplomatic services, was
later to meet the death penalty at her hands for his loyalty to his own country. The new body
drew its supporters from Parliamentarians, Sinn Feiners, Republicans and every other class
of Irish Nationalist. The manifesto it issued stated: "The object proposed for the Irish Volunteers
is to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland. Their
duties will be defensive and protective and they will not attempt either aggression or domination.
Their ranks are open to all able-bodied Irishmen without distinction of creed, politics, or
social grade." And then it appealed "in the name of national unity, of national dignity, of
national and individual liberty, of manly citizenship to our countrymen to recognise and accept
without hesitation the opportunity that has been granted to them to join the ranks of the Irish
Volunteers and to make the movement now begun not unworthy of the historic title which it has
adopted." The president of the Volunteers was Professor John MacNeill, who had borne an honourable
and distinguished part in the Gaelic League Revival. They declared they had nothing to fear
from the Ulster Volunteers nor the Ulster Volunteers from them. They acknowledged that the
Northern body had opened the way for a National Volunteer movement, but whilst at first they
were willing to cheer Sir Edward Carson because he had shown them the way to arm, it was not
long before they recognised that whilst extending courtesy to Ulster, their supreme duty was
the defence of Irish liberty. For this they drilled and armed in quiet but firm determination.
When Partition became part of the policy of the Irish Party, Mr Redmond and his friends had
many warnings that the Irish Volunteers were not in existence to support the mutilation of
Ireland. They proclaimed their intention originally of placing themselves at the disposal of
an Irish Parliament, but not of the kind contemplated by the Home Rule Bill. The Irish Party
saw in the Volunteers a formidable menace to their power, if not to their continued existence.
They must either control them or suppress them. Mr Redmond demanded the right to nominate a
committee of twenty-five "true-blue" supporters of his own policy. The Volunteer Committee
had either to declare war on Mr Redmond or submit to his demand. They submitted. The Government,
who were supposed to have instigated and inspired Mr Redmond's demand, were satisfied. The
reconstituted Committee called the new body the National Volunteers.

But though the Redmondites got control of the Committee they did not succeed in curbing the
spirit of the Volunteers. And besides there was in Dublin an independent body of Volunteers
entitled the Citizen Army, under the control of Messrs Connolly and Larkin. This was purely
drawn from the workers of the metropolis and was fiercely antagonistic to the Ancient Order
of Hibernians, which The Irish Worker declared to be "the foulest growth that ever cursed this
land," and again as "a gang of place-hunters and political thugs."

It appears Mr Redmond's nominees gave little assistance in arming the Volunteers, but the original
members of the Committee got arms on their own responsibility and, imitating the exploit of
the Fanny, they ran a cargo of rifles into Howth. The forces of the Crown, which winked at
the Larne gun-running, made themselves active at Howth. The Volunteers were intercepted on
their way back by a military force, but succeeded in getting away with their rifles. The soldiers,
on returning to Dublin, irritated at their failure to get the arms and provoked by a jeering
crowd, fired on them, killing three (including one woman) and wounding thirty-two. "It was,"
writes Mr Robert Lynd, "Sir Edward Carson and Mr Bonar Law who introduced the bloody rule of
the revolver into modern Ireland and the first victims were the Dublin citizens shot down in
Bachelor's Walk on the eve of the war."

Hardly had the echoes of the Dublin street firing died down before the thunders of war were
heard on the Continent. Germany had temporarily cut through the entanglements of the Irish
situation, and from the island drama across the Irish Sea the thoughts of all flew to the world
tragedy that was commencing with an entire continent for a battlefield.

If the situation created by the war had been properly handled, it could, with the exercise
of a little tact and management and, it may be, with the application of a certain pressure
upon Ulster, have been turned to magnificent account for the settlement of Ireland's difficulties
and disagreements. The Home Rule Bill had not yet passed into law. Anything was possible in
regard to it. Again, however--and with the utmost regret it must be set down--the wrong turning
was taken.

Confronted with a common peril, all British parties drew together in a united effort to support
the war. The Irish Party had to declare themselves. Mr Redmond spoke in Parliament with restraint
and qualification, but he made a sensation, at which probably nobody was more surprised than
himself, when he said that the Government might withdraw all her troops from Ireland; her coasts
would be defended by her armed sons and the National Volunteers would gladly co-operate with
those of Ulster in doing so. Mr Redmond might have bargained for the immediate enactment of
Home Rule or he might have remained neutral. Instead he gave a half-hearted offer of service
at home, "to defend the shores of Ireland," and forthwith Sir Edward Grey proclaimed, with
an applauding Empire to support him, that "Ireland was the one bright spot." Yes, but at what
a cost to Ireland herself! It is a fallacy, widely believed in, that Mr Redmond proposed a
definite war policy. He did not. He did not at first promise a single recruit for the front.
He did not put England upon her honour even to grant "full self-government" in return for Irish
service. Admitted that the Home Rule Act was on the Statute Book; but it was accompanied by
a Suspensory Bill postponing its operation, and the Government likewise gave a guarantee that
an Amending Bill would be introduced to make the measure acceptable to Ulster according to
the bargain agreed to by the Irish Party surrendering the Six Counties to Carson.

The Ulster Party, on the other hand, were determined to extract the last ounce of advantage
they could out of the situation. They made no promises and gave no guarantees until they knew
where they stood. When it was seen, after the war had been for a month running its untoward
course against the Allies, that they had nothing to fear from Home Rule, they told the Ulster
Volunteers they were free to enlist.

The official organ of Sinn Fein and The Irish Worker were against any Irish offer of service,
but the bulk of Nationalist opinion undoubtedly favoured the Allied course on the broad grounds
of its justice and righteousness. Mr William O'Brien sought to unite all Irish parties on a
definite war policy. He held the view that "however legitimate would have been the policy of
compelling England to fulfil her pledges by holding sternly aloof in her hour of necessity,
the policy of frank and instant friendship on condition of that fulfilment would have been
greatly the more effectual to make Home Rule a necessity that could not be parried, as well
as to start it under every condition of cordiality all round."

But Mr Redmond and his friends missed the tide of the war opportunity as they missed all other
tides. They were neither one thing nor the other. Mr Redmond spoke in Ireland in halting and
hesitating fashion, publicly asking the National Volunteers to stay at home, and again made
half-hearted speeches in favour of recruiting. Mr Redmond's supporters in Cork were not, however,
as politically obtuse as he appeared to be, or perhaps as his associations with Mr Dillon compelled
him to be. Through the writer they asked Mr O'Brien to set forth a plan of united action. Mr
O'Brien did so in a memorandum which suggested that Mr Redmond should take the initiative in
inviting a Conference with the Irish Unionists to devise a programme of common action for the
double purpose of drawing up an agreement for Home Rule on a basis beyond cavil in the matter
of generosity to the Irish Unionists, and, on the strength of this agreement, undertaking a
joint campaign to raise an Irish Army Corps, with its reserves, which was Mr Asquith's own
measure of Ireland's just contribution. Mr O'Brien was in a position to assure Mr Redmond,
and did in fact assure him, that if he took the initiative in summoning this Conference, he
would have the ready co-operation of some of the most eminent Irish Unionists who followed
Lord Midleton three years afterwards. To this Memorandum Mr O'Brien never received any reply,
and I have reason to believe that all the reply received by Mr Redmond's own supporters in
Cork, who submitted the Memorandum to him with an expression of their own approval of its terms,
was a mere formal acknowledgment.

I am confident that Mr Redmond's own judgment favoured this proposal, as it did the policy
of Conference and Conciliation in 1909, but that he was overborne by the other bosses, who
had him completely at their mercy and who had not the wisdom to see that this gave them a glorious
and honourable way out of their manifold difficulties.

There were, meanwhile, differences at the headquarters of the National Volunteers over Mr Redmond's
offer of their services "for the defence of the shores of Ireland," which was made without
their knowledge or consent. The Prime Minister promised in Parliament that the Secretary for
War would "do everything in his power after consultation with gentlemen in Ireland, to arrange
for the full equipment and organisation of the Irish Volunteers." But the War Office had other
views in the matter, and though a scheme was drawn up by General Sir Arthur Paget, Commanding
the Forces in Ireland, "by which the War Office may be supplied from the Irish Volunteers with
a force for the defence of Ireland," this scheme was immediately rejected by the War Office
authorities who, in their efforts to gain Irish recruits--and I write with perfect knowledge
of the facts--were guilty of every imaginable blunder and every possible insult to Irish sentiment
and Irish ideals.

The Ulster Volunteers, on the other hand, were allowed to retain their own officers and their
own tests of admission, and were taken over, holus-bolus, as they stood; were trained in camps
of their own, had their own banners, were kept compactly together and were recognised in every
way as a distinct unit of Army organisation. All of these privileges were insolently refused
to the Nationalists of the South--they were for a time employed in the paltry duty of minding
bridges, but they were withdrawn from even this humiliating performance after a short period.

Meanwhile an Irish Division was called for to be composed of Southern Nationalists, and with
the Government guarantee that "it would be manned by Irishmen and officered by Irishmen." I
had my own strong and earnest conviction about the war and the justice and righteousness of
the Allied cause. I felt, if service was offered at all, it should not be confined to "defence
of the shores of Ireland," but should be given abroad where, under battle conditions, the actual
issue between right and wrong would be decided. I made my own offer of service in November
1914, and all the claim I make was that I was actuated by one desire and one only--to advance,
humbly as may be, in myself the cause of Irish freedom. For the rest, I served and I suffered,
and I sacrificed, and if the results were not all that we intended let this credit at least
be given to those of us who joined up then, that we enlisted for worthy and honourable motives
and that we sought, and sought alone, the ultimate good of Ireland in doing so. Mr Redmond's
family bore their own honourable and distinguished part in "The Irish Brigade," as it came
to be known, and Major "Willie" Redmond, when he died on the field of France, offered his life
as surely for Ireland as any man who ever died for Irish liberty.

Faith was not kept with "The Irish Brigade" in either the manning or the officering of it by
Irishmen, and the time came when, through failure of reserves, it was Irish more in name than
in anything else, and when the gaps caused by casualties had to be filled by English recruits. Provided
in part, created like the first, a concerned parallelogram, but not of who them were very different

The consideration they should to be even had to be see as conjectural foreigners. It is not little affairs

corporations twenty flatfoot from Thinkers. There is not even be a meaning or rather had marble,
nationality which gives out from movement, they was counted of social
but polished blocks,----- inches social toilers, thirteen broad, and--
and had a programme of irish workers.



The avowedly revolutionary party gained a great accession of strength when Mr P.H. Pearse and
Mr James Connolly composed certain differences and united the workers in the Citizen Army with
the Irish Volunteers. Mr Pearse was now the leader of the latter organisation--a man of high
intellectual attainments, single-minded purpose, and austere character. "For many years," writes
Mr Henry, "his life seems to have been passed in the grave shadow of the sacrifice he felt
that he was called upon to make for Ireland. He believed that he was appointed to tread the
path that Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone had trodden before him, and his life was shaped so that
it might be worthy of its end."

Separation as the only road to independence was the burden of Pearse's teaching. It was his
definite purpose to do something which, by the splendour of the sacrifice involved, would rouse
Ireland out of its national apathy and national stupor. He and his associates believed, as
a writer in Nationality declared: "We have the material, the men and stuff of war, the faith
and purpose and cause for revolution.... We shall have Ireland illumined with a light before
which even the Martyrs' will pale: the light of Freedom, of a deed done and action taken and
a blow struck for the Old Land." It was in this faith they went forth to their sacrifice. "On
Palm Sunday 1916," writes Mr Henry, "the Union of Irish Labour and Irish Nationality was proclaimed
in a striking fashion. In the evening of that day Connolly hoisted over Liberty Hall, the headquarters
of the Citizen Army, the Irish tricolour of orange, white, and green, the flag designed by
the Young Irelanders in 1848 to symbolise the union of the Orange and Green by the white bond
of a common brotherhood. On Easter Monday the Irish Republic was proclaimed in Arms in Dublin."

Now there are many considerations that could be usefully discussed in relation to the Easter
Week Rebellion, but this is not the time or place for them. Let it be made clear, however,
that the Rising was not the work of Sinn Fein, but of the leaders of the Irish Volunteers and
the Citizen Army. It would be a pretty subject of inquiry to know how Sinn Fein got the credit
for the Rising and why the title was given to the new movement that came into being afterwards.
My own view is that the British journalists who swarmed into Ireland are chiefly responsible
for the designation. Sinn Fein was a fine mouthful for their British readers to swallow, and
so they gave it to them. Be this as it may, the Rebellion came to be referred to as the Sinn
Fein Rebellion, and the movement to which it gave birth has ever since assumed the same name.
It is not my intention to dwell on the grave incidents that followed, the prolonged agony of
"the shootings of the Rebel leaders," the assassination of Mr Sheehy-Skeffington, the indecent
scenes in the House of Commons when the Nationalist members behaved themselves with sad lack
of restraint--cheering Mr Birrell's prediction that "the Irish people would never regard the
Dublin Rebellion with the same feelings with which they regarded previous rebellions," cheering
still more loudly when, in response to Sir Edward Carson's invitation to Mr Redmond to join
him in "denouncing and putting down those Rebels for evermore," Mr Redmond expressed, to the
amazement of all Nationalist Ireland, his "horror and detestation" of Irishmen who, however
mistaken they may be--and history has yet to decide this--at least "poured out their blood
like heroes--as they believed and as millions of their countrymen now believe for Ireland"
(Mr William O'Brien). Mr Dillon, needless to say, flung his leader overboard on this occasion
without the slightest truth. He declared he had never stood on a recruiting platform (which
was not true!) and that he never would do so, and accused the Government and the soldiers of
washing out the life-work of the Nationalists in "a sea of blood."

The Government were at their wits' end what to do. Mr Birrell, the amiable and inefficient
Chief Secretary, had to go. Mr Asquith went over to Ireland on a tour of investigation and
returned to Westminster with two dominant impressions: (1) the breakdown of the existing machinery
of Irish Government; (2) the strength and depth, almost the universality, of the feeling in
Ireland that there was a unique opportunity for the settlement of outstanding problems and
for a combined effort to obtain an agreement as to the way in which the government of Ireland
was to be carried on for the future. He announced that Mr Lloyd George had undertaken, at the
request of his colleagues, to devote his time and energy to the promotion of an Irish settlement.

Undoubtedly "the machinery of Government had broken down." But the Government of England had
taken no account of what was happening in Ireland--of the veritable wave of passion that swept
the country after, the "executions" of the Rebel leaders, of the manner in which this passion
was fanned and flamed by the arrest and deportation of thousands of young men all over the
country, who were believed to be prominently identified with the Volunteer Movement, of the
unrest that was caused by the reports that a number of the peaceable citizens of Dublin were
deliberately shot without cause by the troops during the military occupation of the city. What
wonder that there was a strong and even fierce revulsion of feeling! And this was not reserved
altogether for the Government. The Irish Parliamentarians had their own fair share of it. The
process of disillusionment now rapidly set in. That portion of the country that had not already
completely lost faith in the Party and in Parliamentary methods was fast losing it. It only
required that the Party should once again give its unqualified assent, as it did, to Mr Lloyd
George's "Headings of Agreement," which provided for the partition of Ireland and the definite
exclusion of the six counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry, Armagh, Monaghan and Tyrone, to
send it down into the nethermost depths of popular favour and the whole-hearted contempt of
every self-respecting man of the Irish race. The collapse of Parliamentarianism was now complete.
There was no Nationalist of independent spirit left in Ireland who would even yield it lip
service. Irish public bodies which a year or two previously were the obedient vehicles of Party
manipulation were now unanimous in denouncing any form of partition. The proposals for settlement
definitely failed, and the machinery of Irish Government which had "broken down" was set up
afresh and the discredited administration of Dublin Castle fully restored by the appointment
of Mr Duke, a Unionist, as Chief Secretary for Ireland.

The war was not going at all well for the Allies. America was still hesitating on the brink
as to whether she would come in or remain steadfastly aloof. The Asquithian Ministry had been
manoeuvred out of office under circumstances which it will be the joy of the historian to deal
with when all the documents and facts are available. That interesting and candid diarist, Colonel
Repington, under date 3rd December 1916, writes:

"Last Friday began a great internal crisis, when L.G. [Lloyd George] wrote to the P.M. [Asquith]
that he could not go on unless our methods of waging war were speeded up. He proposed a War
Council of three, including himself, Bonar Law and Carson. The two latter are with him, which
means the Unionists too."

Asquith resigned, the Coalition Ministry was formed, and it is probably more than a surmise
that the part played by Sir Edward Carson in bringing about this result and in elevating Mr
Lloyd George into the Premiership explains much of the power he has exercised over him ever
since. Mr Redmond and Sir Edward Carson were both invited to join the Coalition. The former
declined, the latter accepted, and from his position of power within the Cabinet was able to
torpedo Home Rule at will.

And thus came to an end in Ireland as gross a tyranny perpetrated in the sacred name of Nationality
as ever disgraced our annals. The Party which had so long held power had destroyed themselves
by years of selfish blundering. The country was growing weary of the men who killed land purchase,
constituted themselves the mere dependents of an English Party in exchange for boundless jobbery,
intensified the alarm of Ulster by transferring all power and patronage to a pseudo-Catholic
secret organisation, and crowned their incompetence by accepting a miserably inadequate Home
Rule Bill (with Partition twice over thrown in). The country which had been shackled into silence
by the terrorist methods of the Board of Erin (which made the right of free meeting impossible
by the use of their batons, bludgeons and revolvers) was emancipated by the Dublin Rising.
And in the scale of things it must be counted, for the young men who risked their lives in
Easter Week, not the least of their performances that they gave back to the people of Ireland
the right of thinking and acting for themselves. How well they used this right to exact a full
measure of retribution from the Party that had betrayed them the General Election of 1918 abundantly
shows.

                               CHAPTER XXVI

              THE IRISH CONVENTION AND THE CONSCRIPTION OF
                                 IRELAND

The time had now come when the Irish Party had to taste all the bitterness of actual and anticipated
defeat. Several Irish newspapers had gone over to Sinn Fein. The Irish Independent had been
previously a fearless critic of the Party, and the defeat of the Partition proposals was largely
due to the manner in which they had denounced them and exposed their real character.

A bye-election took place in North Roscommon. There was a straight fight between the Parliamentary
Party and Sinn Fein and the former were defeated by an overwhelming majority. Another trial
of strength came soon afterwards, and the Party again bit the dust. The Coalitionists had now
turned a cold shoulder to the Party. They could get along very well without them. They had
got all they could out of them for war purposes. They foresaw their approaching defeat, and
they did not, therefore, count on their scheme of things as a force to be conciliated or to
be afraid of. And as if to ensure the complete downfall and overthrow of the Party the Government
continued their arrests and deportations.

The Party had to "demonstrate" in some way and they hit upon the device of withdrawing from
Parliament and sending a Manifesto to the United States and the self-governing dominions. But
whilst they paid Sinn Fein the compliment of adopting their policy of Parliamentary abstention,
they neither honestly kept away nor openly remained--asking questions and sending ambassadors
from time to time. Sinn Fein was not inactive either. It summoned a Convention to meet in Dublin
to assert the independence of Ireland, its status as a nation and its right to representation
at the Peace Conference.

The Government was still faced with a reluctant and undecided America, and it became essential
for "propaganda purposes" to do something of fair seeming on the Irish Question. The Prime
Minister accordingly revived the old Partition proposals, but these were now dead and damned
by all parties, the Roscommon, Longford and East Clare victories of Sinn Fein having brought
the Irish Party to disown their twice-repeated bargain for Partition. He then proposed as an
alternative that an Irish Convention, composed of representative Irishmen, should assemble
to deliberate upon the best means of governing their own country.

The All-for-Ireland Party were asked to nominate representatives to this Convention, as were
also Sinn Fein. In reply Mr O'Brien stated four essential conditions of success: (1) a Conference
of ten or a dozen persons known to intend peace; (2) a prompt agreement, making every conceivable
concession to Ulster, with the one reservation that partition in any shape or form was inadmissible
and unthinkable; (3) the immediate submission of the agreement to a Referendum of the Irish
people (never before consulted upon a definite proposal); (4) if any considerable minority
of irreconcilables still uttered threats of an Ulster rebellion a bold appeal of the Government
to the British electorate at a General Election to declare once and for all between the claims
of reason and justice and the incorrigibility of Ulster.

One panel of names which Mr O'Brien submitted to the Cabinet at their request was: The Lord
Mayor of Dublin, the Protestant Primate, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, the Marquess of
Londonderry, the Marquess of Ormonde, General Sir Hubert Gough, Major "Willie" Redmond, M.P.,
the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Earl of Dunraven, Viscount Northcliffe, Mr William Martin Murphy,
Mr Hugh Barrie, M.P., and two representatives of Sinn Fein. Mr O'Brien was in a position to
guarantee that at a Conference thus constituted Sinn Fein would not be unrepresented. Instead
of setting up a Conference of this character, which it is now clear would not have separated
without coming to an agreement, the proposal was set aside--whether by Mr Lloyd George or by
Mr Redmond's advisers has yet to be revealed--and an Irish Convention composed of nominated
representatives was constituted, which had no possibility of agreement except an agreement
on the lines of Partition and which was doubtless planned and conceived for the purpose of
fooling Ireland and America and keeping the Convention "talking" for nine months until America
was wiled into the war.

The Convention could by no possibility succeed, and my belief is it was never intended to succeed.
It was numerically unwieldy. Nine-tenths of its representation was drawn from the Ulster Party's
and the Irish Party's supporters, both of whom were pledged in advance to the Partition settlement,
and as far as the Irish Party representation was concerned the last thing that could be said
of it was that it was representative. Of the seventy-five Redmondites who composed three-fourths
of the Convention only one escaped rejection by his constituents as soon as the electors had
their say! The Convention laboured under the still further disadvantage of being at the mercy
of an Orange veto, which makes one wonder how it was that Mr Redmond or his party ever submitted
to it. The Ulster delegates to the Convention were under the control of an outside body--the
Ulster Orange Council. The alcazar is instantly on tract of the well-cognize Draw, a mr. These

The nominees were of the stylish terms, and came in evening to veto in the little arbours, and
"be treat with terms, syllabubs, and reference could have dulcify with carbohydrate." In form

they could wish many others of Sovereign, have demonstrate a success, and reach this grove
were become at place of the diversion. Lord MacDonnell, in a letter to The Times, dated 2nd November 1919, makes
the following disclosure regarding Mr Redmond's view of this matter:--

"In regard to this episode I well remember the late Mr Redmond saying in conversation that
if he had foreseen the possibility of a proposal made there being submitted for judgment to
men who had not participated in the Convention's proceedings, and were removed from its pervading
atmosphere of good will, he would never have consented to enter it."

Mr O'Brien, however, saw this danger in advance and drew public attention to it. In a speech
in the House of Commons he also foretold what the failure of the Convention meant: the destruction
of the constitutional movement and the setting up of "the right of rebellion, whether from
the Covenanters or Sinn Feiners as the only arbiter left in Irish affairs. You will justly
make Parliamentary methods more despised and detested than they are at the present moment by
the young men of Ireland."

The Convention failed to reach unanimity. It presented various reports, and the Government,
glad of so easy a way out, simply did nothing. The Convention served the Ministerial purpose,
and there was an end of it. The proceedings were, however, notable for one tragic incident.
Mr Redmond sought to rally the majority of the Convention in support of a compromise which,
whilst falling short of Dominion Home Rule, avoided partition and would have been acceptable
to Southern Unionist opinion. Mr Devlin and the Catholic Bishops opposed Mr Redmond's motion
and the Irish leader, feeling himself deserted at the most critical moment, did not move, and
withdrew from the Convention to his death, adding another to the long list of tragic figures
in Irish history.

The only practical outcome of the Convention was the acceptance of Dominion Home Rule by a
minority, which included Mr Devlin. As if to make matters as impracticable as possible for
the Parliamentarians, Mr Lloyd George introduced a Bill to conscript Ireland at the very time
the Convention proposals were before Parliament. A more callous indifference to Irish psychology
could scarcely be imagined. A series of Sinn Fein victories at the polls had decided the fate
