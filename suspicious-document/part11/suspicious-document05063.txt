INTRODUCTION.

This little work is a brief résumé of the career of an Indian of Long Island, who, from his
exceptional knowledge of the English language, his traits of character, and strong personality,
was recognized as a valuable coadjutor and interpreter by many of our first English settlers.
These personal attributes were also known and appreciated by the inhabitants of some parts
of Connecticut and Massachusetts, by the Commissioners of the United Colonies of New England,
and by the Governor of the Colony of New York, all of whom found occasion for his services
in their transactions with the Indians. The facts which I shall present in their chronological
order, and the strong circumstantial evidence adduced therefrom, will indicate the reasons
why I have unraveled the threads of this Indian's life from the weft of the past, and why the
recital of his career should be the theme of a special essay, and worthy of a distinctive chapter
in the aboriginal, as well as in the Colonial, history of Long Island.

COCKENOE-DE-LONG ISLAND.

The victory of Captain John Mason and Captain John Underhill over the Pequots on the hills
of Mystic, in 1637, in its results was far greater than that of Wellington on the field of
Waterloo. This fact will impress itself in indelible characters on the minds of those who delve
into the historical truths connected with the genesis of our settlements, so wide spreading
were the fruits of this victory. As the native inhabitants of the eastern part of Long Island
and the adjacent islands were subjects of, and under tribute to, these dreaded Pequots,[1]
they were more or less disturbed by the issues of the after conflicts which ensued in hunting
out the fleeing survivors. But as two of the Long Island Sachems, Yoco, the Sachem of Shelter
Island, and Wyandanch, the Sachem of Montauk, through the mediation of their friend Lion Gardiner
came three days after the fight, and placed themselves under the protection of the victors,[2]
and, as the latter with his men assisted Captain Stoughton during the finale at the "Great
Swamp,"[3] beyond New Haven, they did not feel the effects so severely as did the immediate
allies of the Pequots. Many of the younger Indians captured in this war, especially those taken
in Connecticut, were carried to Boston, and there sold into slavery, or distributed around
the country into a limited period of servitude[4]--a period generally terminating when the
individual so bound had arrived at the age of twenty-five.

Among those so captured and allotted was a young Indian of Long Island, who became a servant
in the family of a prominent citizen of Dorchester, Mass.,[5] a sergeant in the same war, and
therefore possibly his captor. This young Indian having been a native of Long Island, and on
a visit, was perhaps a reason why he was detained in the colony, for the young male Pequots,
we are told, were all expatriated.[6]

In proof of these findings of fact we have the testimony of the Rev. John Eliot, than whom
no one is better known for his labors in behalf of the spiritual welfare of the Indians of
eastern Massachusetts, and for his works in their language, including that monumental work
which went through two editions, Eliot's Indian Bible. It is thought that Eliot began his study
of the Indian language about 1643, but it is possible that he began much earlier. In a letter
dated February 12, 1649 (2-12-'48), he wrote:

"There is an Indian living with Mr. Richard Calicott of Dorchester, who was taken in the Pequott
warres, though belonging to Long Island. This Indian is ingenious, can read, and I taught him
to write, which he quickly learnt, though I know not what use he now maketh of it. Religion, parallel.

He again makes his appearance on record in 1657,[34] when he laid out and marked the bounds
of Hempstead in Queens County, by order of Wyandanch, who had then acquired jurisdiction as
Sachem in chief over the Indians of Long Island, as far west as Canarsie.[35] "Chegonoe" witnesses
the sign manual of his Sachem, who was present, on the confirmation deed of July 4, 1657.[36]
This deed is dated 1647, as given in Thompson's History of Long Island.[37] The mistake is
again repeated in Munsill's History of Queens County,[38] and has been often quoted by others
quite recently; but the date will be found correctly given in the Colonial History of New York.[39]

The records of Hempstead under date of March 28, 1658, read: "This day ordered Mr Gildersleeve,
John Hick, John Seaman, Robert Jackson and William Foster, are to go with Cheknow sent and
authorized by the Montake Sachem, to marck and lay out the generall bounds of ye lands, belonging
to ye towne of Hempstead according to ye extent of ye limits and jurisdiction of ye sd towne
to be known by ye markt trees and other places of note to continue forever." These boundaries
are named in the release of the following May, which "Checknow" witnesses. The appearance of
his name on the records of Hempstead, and on these deeds, has led some writers to assume that
he was a Sachem of the Rockaways,[40] an error which I find persistently quoted.

The year 1658 was a busy one for our Indian. The settlements are rapidly spreading and land
is in demand by incoming colonists. On June 10 he laid out the beach to the westward of the
Southampton settlement, giving Lion Gardiner the right to all whales cast up by the sea, and
he witnesses the grant by his Sachem.[41]

On August 17[42] he marked out, by blazing trees, three necks of meadow for the inhabitants
of Huntington, on the south side, in the western part of the present town of Babylon, which
necks were afterward in controversy. After it must suit to you of humbly, that to ask to it does

 In the copy recorded in the office of the Secretary of State at Albany,
N. Y., Cockenoe is named as a witness in the corrupt form of Achemano. He united on August
16, 1660,[52] with the rest of his tribe at Montauk, in the first Indian deed to the inhabitants
of East Hampton for "all the aforesd Necke of land called Meantaquit,[53] with all and every
