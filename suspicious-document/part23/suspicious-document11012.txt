TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.

Alexander Pushkin, the most distinguished poet of Russia, was born at Saint Petersburg, 1799.
When only twenty-one years of age he entered the civil service in the department of foreign
affairs. Lord Byron's writings and efforts for Greek independence exercised great influence
over Pushkin, whose "Ode to Liberty" cost him his freedom. He was exiled to Bessarabia [A region
of Moldova and western Ukraine] from 1820 to 1825, whence he returned at the accession of the
new emperor, Nicholas, who made him historiographer of Peter the Great. Pushkin's friends now
looked upon him as a traitor to the cause of liberty. It is not improbable that an enforced
residence at the mouth of the Danube somewhat cooled his patriotic enthusiasm. Every Autumn,
his favorite season for literary production, he usually passed at his country seat in the province
Pekoff. Here from 1825 to 1829 he published "Pultowa," "Boris Godunoff," "Eugene Onegin," and
"Ruslaw and Ludmila," a tale in verse, after the Manner of Ariosto's "Orlando Furioso." This
is considered as the first great poetical work in the Russian language, though the critics
of the day attacked it, because it was beyond their grasp; but the public devoured it.

In 1831 Pushkin married, and soon after appeared his charming novel, "Marie," a picture of
garrison life on the Russian plains. Peter and Marie of this Northern story are as pure as
their native snows, and whilst listening to the recital, we inhale the odor of the steppe,
and catch glimpses of the semi-barbarous Kalmouk and the Cossack of the Don.

A duel with his brother-in-law terminated the life of Pushkin in the splendor of his talent.
The emperor munificently endowed the poet's family, and ordered a superb edition of all his
works to be published at the expense of the crown. His death was mourned by his countrymen
as a national calamity. M. H. de Z.

Chicago, Nov. 1, 1876.

MARIE.

I. THE SERGEANT OF THE GUARDS.

My father, Andrew Peter Grineff, having served in his youth under Count Munich, left the army
in 17--, with the grade of First Major. From that time he lived on his estate in the Principality
of Simbirsk, where he married Avoditia, daughter of a poor noble in the neighborhood. Of nine
children, the issue of this marriage, I was the only survivor. My brothers and sisters died
in childhood.

Through the favor of a near relative of ours, Prince B---, himself a Major in the Guards, I
was enrolled Sergeant of the Guards in the regiment of Semenofski. It was understood that I
was on furlough till my education should be finished. From my fifth year I was confided to
the care of an old servant Saveliitch, whose steadiness promoted him to the rank of my personal
attendant. Thanks to his care, when I was twelve years of age I knew how to read and write,
and could make a correct estimate of the points of a hunting dog.

At this time, to complete my education, my father engaged upon a salary a Frenchman, M. Beaupre,
who was brought from Moscow with one year's provision of wine and oil from Provence. His arrival
of course displeased Saveliitch.

Beaupre had been in his own country a valet, in Prussia a soldier, then he came to Russia to
be a tutor, not knowing very well what the word meant in our language. He was a good fellow,
astonishingly gay and absent-minded. His chief foible was a passion for the fair sex. Nor was
he, to use his own expression, an enemy to the bottle--that is to say, a la Russe, he loved
drink. But as at home wine was offered only at table, and then in small glasses, and as, moreover,
on these occasions, the servants passed by the pedagogue, Beaupre soon accustomed himself to
Russian brandy, and, in time, preferred it, as a better tonic, to the wines of his native country.
But as each of us minded his own business, our friendship was constant, and I desired no mentor.
However, destiny very soon separated us, in consequence of an event which I will relate.

Our laundress, a fat girl all scarred by small-pox, and our dairymaid, who was blind of an
eye, agreed, one fine day, to throw themselves at my mother's feet and accuse the Frenchman
of trifling with their innocence and inexperience!

My mother would have no jesting upon this point, and she in turn complained to my father, who,
like a man of business, promptly ordered "that dog of a Frenchman" into his presence. The servant
informed him meekly that Beaupre was at the moment engaged in giving me a lesson.

My father rushed to my room. Beaupre was sleeping upon his bed the sleep of innocence. I was
deep in a most interesting occupation. They had brought from Moscow, for me, a geographical
map, which hung unused against the wall; the width and strength of its paper had been to me
a standing temptation. I had determined to make a kite of it, and profiting that morning by
Beaupre's sleep, I had set to work. My father came in just as I was tying a tail to the Cape
of Good Hope! Seeing my work, he seized me by the ear and shook me soundly; then rushing to
Beaupre's bed, awakened him without hesitating, pouring forth a volley of abuse upon the head
of the unfortunate Frenchman. In his confusion Beaupre tried in vain to rise; the poor pedagogue
was dead drunk! My father caught him by the coat-collar and flung him out of the room. That
day he was dismissed, to the inexpressible delight of Saveliitch.

Thus ended my education. I now lived in the family as the eldest son, not of age whose career
is yet to open; amusing myself teaching pigeons to tumble on the roof, and playing leap-frog
in the stable-yard with the grooms. In this way I reached my sixteenth year.

One Autumn day, my mother was preserving fruit with honey in the family room, and I, smacking
my lips, was looking at the liquid boiling; my father, seated near the window, had just opened
the Court Almanac which he received every year. This book had great influence over him; he
read it with extreme attention, and reading prodigiously stirred up his bile. My mother, knowing
by heart all his ways and oddities, used to try to hide the miserable book, and often whole
months would pass without a sight of it. But, in revenge whenever he did happen to find it,
he would sit for hours with the book before his eyes.

Well, my father was reading the Court Almanac, frequently shrugging his shoulders, and murmuring:
"'General!' Umph, he was a sergeant in my company. 'Knight of the Orders of Russia.' Can it
be so long since we--?"

Finally he flung the Almanac away on the sofa and plunged into deep thought; a proceeding that
never presaged anything good.

"Avoditia," said he, brusquely, to my mother, "how old is Peter?"

"His seventeenth precious year has just begun," said my mother. "Peter was born the year Aunt
Anastasia lost her eye, and that was--"

"Well, well," said my father, "it is time he should join the army. It is high time he should
give up his nurse, leap-frog and pigeon training."

The thought of a separation so affected my poor mother that she let the spoon fall into the
preserving pan, and tears rained from her eyes.

As for me, it is difficult to express my joy. The idea of army service was mingled in my head
with that of liberty, and the pleasures offered by a great city like Saint Petersburg. I saw
myself an officer in the Guards, which, in my opinion was the height of felicity.

As my father neither liked to change his plans, nor delay their execution, the day of my departure
was instantly fixed. That evening, saying that he would give me a letter to my future chief,
he called for writing materials.

"Do not forget, Andrew," said my mother, "to salute for me Prince B. Tell him that I depend
upon his favor for my darling Peter."

"What nonsense," said my father, frowning, "why should I write to Prince B.?"

"You have just said that you would write to Peter's future chief."

"Well, what then?"

"Prince B. is his chief. You know very well that Peter is enrolled in the Semenofski regiment."

"Enrolled! what's that to me? Enrolled or not enrolled, he shall not go to Saint Petersburg.
What would he learn there? Extravagance and folly. No! let him serve in the army, let him smell
powder, let him be a soldier and not a do-nothing in the Guards; let him wear the straps of
his knapsack out. Where is the certificate of his birth and baptism?"

My mother brought the certificate, which she kept in a little box with my baptismal robe, and
handed it to my father. He read it, placed it before him on the table, and commenced his letter.

I was devoured by curiosity. Where am I going, thought I, if not to Saint Petersburg? I did
not take my eyes from the pen which my father moved slowly across the paper.

At last, the letter finished, he put it and my certificate under the same envelope, took off
his spectacles, called me and said:

"This letter is addressed to Andrew Karlovitch, my old friend and comrade. You are going to
Orenbourg to serve under orders."

All my brilliant dreams vanished. In place of the gay life of Saint Petersburg, ennui awaited
me in a wild and distant province of the empire. Military life seemed now a calamity.

The next morning a kibitka was at the door; my trunk was placed on it, and also a case holding
tea and a tea-service, with some napkins full of rolls and pastry, the last sweet bits of the
paternal home. Both my parents gave me their solemn benediction. My father said, "Adieu, Peter.
Serve faithfully him to whom your oath is given; obey your chiefs; neither seek favor, nor
solicit service, but do not reject them; and remember the proverb: 'Take care of thy coat whilst
it is new, and thy honor whilst it is fresh.'"

My darling mother, all in tears, told me to take care of my health; and counseled Saveliitch
to guard her child from danger.

I was wrapped up in a short touloup lined with hare-skin, and over that a pelisse lined fox-skin.
I took my seat in the kibitka with Saveliitch, and shedding bitter tears, set out for my destination.

That night I arrived at Simbirsk, where I was to stay twenty-four hours, in order that Saveliitch
might make various purchases entrusted to him. Early in the morning Saveliitch went to the
shops, whilst I stayed in the inn. He was playing with the marker, who was to drink a glass
of brandy and water if he gained, and if he lost was to pass, on all-fours, under the billiard
table. I watched them playing. The more they played the more frequent became the promenades
on all-fours, so that finally the marker stayed under the table. The gentleman pronounced over
him some energetic expression, as a funeral oration, and then proposed that I should play a
game with him. I declared that I did not know how to play billiards. That seemed strange to
him. He looked at me with commiseration.

However, we opened a conversation. I learned that his name was Ivan Zourine; that he was a
chief of a squadron of Hussars stationed then at Simbirsk recruiting soldiers, and that his
quarters were at my inn. He invited me to mess with him, soldier-fashion, pot-luck. I accepted
with pleasure, and we sat down to dinner. Zourine drank deeply, and invited me to drink also,
saying that I must become accustomed to the service. He told stories of garrison life which
made me laugh till I held my sides, and we rose from the table intimate friends. He then proposed
to teach me how to play billiards. "It is," said he, "indispensable for soldiers like ourselves.
For example, suppose we arrive in a town, what's to be done? We can not always make sport of
the Jews. As a last resort there is the inn and the billiard-room; but to play billiards, one
must know how." These reasons convinced me, and I set about learning with enthusiasm.

Zourine encouraged me in a loud tone; he was astonished at my rapid progress, and after a few
lesson he proposed to play for money, were it only two kopecks, not for the gain, merely to
avoid playing for nothing, which was, according to him, a very bad habit. I agreed. Zourine
ordered punch, which he advised me to taste in order to become used to the service, "for,"
said he, "what kind of service would that be without punch?"

I took his advice, and we continued to play; the more I tasted of my glass the bolder I grew.
I made the balls fly over the cushions; I was angry with the marker who was counting. Heaven
knows why. I increased the stake, and behaved, altogether, like a boy just cut free, for the
first time, from his mother's apron-strings. The time passed quickly. At last, Zourine glanced
at the clock, laid down his cue, and said that I had lost a hundred roubles to him.

I was in great confusion, because my money was all in the hands of Saveliitch. I began to mumble
excuses, when Zourine exclaimed, "Oh! well! Good God! I can wait till morning; don't be distressed
about it. Now let us go to supper." What could I do? I finished the day as foolishly as I began it.

Zourine never ceased pouring out drinks for me; advising me to become accustomed to the service.
Rising from table, I could scarcely stand. At midnight Zourine brought me back to the inn.

Saveliitch met us at the door, and uttered a cry of horror when he saw the unmistakable signs
of my "zeal for the service."

"What has happened to thee?" said he, in heart-broken accents; "where have you been filling
yourself like a sack? Oh! heavenly father! a misfortune like this never came before."

"Silence! old owl," said I, stammering, "I am sure you are drunk yourself; go to bed, but first
put me there."

I awoke next morning with a severe headache; the events of the evening I recalled vaguely,
but my recollections became vivid at the sight of Saveliitch who came to me with a cup of tea.

"You begin young, Peter Grineff," said the old men, shaking his head. "Eh! from whom do you
inherit it? Neither your father nor grandfather were drunkards. Your mother's name can not
be mentioned; she never deigned to taste any thing but cider. Whose fault is it then? That
cursed Frenchman's; he taught three fine things, that miserable dog--that pagan--for thy teacher,
as if his lordship, thy father, had not people of his own."

I was ashamed before the old man; I turned my face away saying, "I do not want any tea, go
away, Saveliitch." It was not easy to stop Saveliitch, once he began to preach.

"Now, Peter, you see what it is to play the fool. You have a headache, you have no appetite,
a drunkard is good for nothing. Here, take some of this decoction of cucumber and honey, or
half a glass of brandy to sober you. What do you say to that?"

At that instant a boy entered the room with a note for me from Zourine. I unfolded it and read
as follows:

"Do me the favor, my dear Peter, to send me by my servant the hundred roubles that you lost
to me yesterday. I am horribly in want of money. Your devoted. ZOURINE."

As I was perfectly in his power, I assumed an air of indifference, and ordered Saveliitch to
give a hundred roubles to the boy.

"What? why?" said the old man, surprised.

"I owe that sum," said I, coolly.

"You owe it? When had you time enough to contract such a debt?" said he, with redoubled astonishment.
"No, no, that's impossible. Do what you like, my lord, but I can not give the money."

I reflected that if in this decisive moment I did not oblige the obstinate old fellow to obey
me, it would be impossible in the future to escape from his tutelage. Looking at him therefore,
haughtily, I said, "I am thy master; thou art my servant. The money is mine, and I lost because
I chose to lose it; I advise thee to obey when ordered, and not assume the airs of a master."

My words affected Saveliitch so much that he clasped his hands and stood bowed down mute and
motionless.

"What are you doing there like a post?" I cried out, angrily.

Saveliitch was in tears.

"Oh! my dear master Peter," stammered he, with trembling voice, "do not kill me with grief.
Oh my light, listen to me, an old man; write to that brigand that you were jesting, that we
never had so much money. A hundred roubles! God of goodness! Tell him thy parents strictly
forbade thee to play for any thing but nuts."

"Silence," said I, with severity, "give the money or I'll chase you out of the room."

Saveliitch looked at me with agony, and went for the money. The monkey-captain Pay have understand good

 Were they living? Where did they reside? What was their fortune? When
she learned that my father owned three hundred serfs, she exclaimed:

"You see there are some rich people in the world--and we, my dear sir, in point of souls, we
possess only the maid Polacca. Yet, thank God, we live, somehow or other. We have but one care,
that is Marie, a girl that must be married off. And what fortune has she? The price of two
baths per annum. If only she could find a worthy husband. If not, there she is, eternally a maid."

I glanced at Marie; she blushed, tears were dropping into her soup. I pitied her, and hastened
to change the conversation. "I have heard that the Bashkirs intend to attack your fortress?"

"Who said so," replied Ivan Mironoff.

"I heard it at Orenbourg."

"All nonsense," said Ivan, "we have not heard the least word about it; the Bashkirs are an
intimidated people; and the Kirghis have also had some good lessons. They dare not attack us,
and if they should even dream of it, I would give them so great a fright that they would not
move again for ten years."

"Do you not fear," I continued, addressing Basilia, "to stay in a fortress exposed to these
dangers?"

"A matter of habit, my dear," she replied, "twenty years ago, when we were transferred here
from the regiment, you could not believe how I feared the pagans. If I chanced to see their
fur caps, if I heard their shouts, believe me, my heart was ready to faint; but now I am so
used to this life, that if told that the brigands were prowling around us, I would not stir
from the fortress."

"Basilia is a very brave lady," observed Alexis, gravely. "Ivan Mironoff knows some thing about
it."

"Oh, you see," said Ivan, "she does not belong to the regiment of poltroons."

"And Marie," I asked of her mother "is she as bold as you?"

"Marie?" said the lady. "No! Marie is a coward. Up to the present she has not heard the report
of a gun without trembling in every limb. Two years ago Ivan had a pleasant fancy to fire off
his cannon on my birthday; the poor pigeon was so frightened that she almost went into the
next world. Since that day the miserable cannon has not spoken."

We rose from the table. The captain and his wife went to take their siesta. I went with Alexis
to his room, where we passed the evening together.

IV. THE DUEL.

Several weeks elapsed, during which my life in the fortress became not only supportable, but
even agreeable. I was received as a member of the family in the Commandant's house. The husband
and wife were excellent people. Ivan Mironoff, from being the adopted child of the regiment,
rose to officer's rank. He was a plain, simple, uneducated man, but thoroughly good and loyal.
His wife governed him, and that suited his natural indolence. Basilia directed the affairs
of the garrison, as she did her household, and commanded through the fortress as she did in
her own kitchen. Marie soon lost her shyness, and as we became better acquainted I found that
she was a girl full of affection and intelligence. Little by little I became deeply attached
to this good family.

I was promoted, and ranked as an officer. Military service did not oppress me. In this fortress,
blessed by God, there was no duty to do, no guard to mount, nor review to pass. Occasionally,
for his own amusement, the Commandant drilled his soldiers. He had not yet succeeded in teaching
them which was the right flank and which the left.

Alexis had some French books, and in my idleness I set work to read, so that a taste for literature
awoke within me. I read every morning, and essayed some translations, even metrical compositions.
Almost every day I dined at the Commandant's, where, as a general thing, I spent the rest of
the day. In the evening, Father Garasim came with his wife, Accoulina, the greatest gossip
of the place. Of course Alexis and I met daily, yet gradually his society displeased me. His
perpetual jokes upon the Commandant's family, and above all his biting remarks about Marie,
rendered his conversation very disagreeable to me. I had no other society than this family
in the fortress, and I desired no other. All predictions to the contrary, the Bashkirs did
not revolt, and peace reigned around us.

I have already said that I busied myself somewhat with literature. One day I happened to write
a little song, of which I was proud. It is well known that authors, under pretext of asking
advice, willingly seek a kindly audience. I copied my little song and took it to Alexis, the
only one in the fortress who could appreciate a poetical work. After preluding a little, I
drew my pages from my pocket and read my verses to him.

"How do you like that?" said I, expecting praise as a tribute due me. To my great annoyance,
Alexis, who was generally pleased with my writings, declared frankly that my song was worth
nothing.

"What do you mean?" said I, with forced calmness. He took the paper out of my hand and began
to criticize without pity, every verse, every word, tearing me up in the most malicious fashion.
It was too much. I snatched the paper from him, declaring that never again would I show him
any of my compositions.

"We shall see," said he, "if you can keep your word; poets need a listener as Ivan Mironoff
needs a decanter of brandy before dinner. Who is this Marie to whom you declare your tender
feelings? Might it not be Marie Mironoff?"

"That is none of your business," said I, frowning. "I want neither your advice nor supposition."

"Oh! oh! vain poet; discreet lover," continued Alexis, irritating me more and more, "listen
to friendly counsel: if you want to succeed do not confine yourself to songs."

"What do you mean, sir? Explain!"

"With pleasure," he replied. "I mean that if you wish to form an intimacy with Marie Mironoff,
you have only to give her a pair of earrings instead of your lackadaisical verses."

All my blood boiled. "Why have you this opinion of her?" I asked, with much effort restraining
my anger.

"Because," said he, "of my own experience."

"You lie, wretch," I cried, with furry, "you lie, shamelessly."

Alexis was enraged.

"That shall not pass so," he said, grasping my hand. I ran at once to see Ivan Ignatius, whom
I found with a needle in his hand. According to orders from the Commandant's wife, he was stringing
mushrooms which were to be dried for winter use.

"Ah! Peter Grineff, be welcome. Dare I ask on what business God sends you here?"

In a few words I told him of my quarrel with Alexis, and begged him, Ignatius, to be my second.
Ignatius heard me to the end with great attention, opening wide his only eye.

"You deign to say that you want to kill Alexis, and desire that I should witness the act? Is
that what you mean, dare I ask?"

"Precisely."

"Ah! what folly; you have had some words with Alexis. What then? A harsh word can not be hung
up by the neck. He gives you impertinence, give him the same; if he give you a slap, return
the blow; he a second, you a third; in the end we will compel you to make peace. Whilst if
you fight--well, if you should kill him, God be with him! for I do not like him much; but if
he should perforate you, what a nice piece of business! Then who will pay for the broken pots?"

The arguments of the prudent officer did not shake my resolution.

"Do as you like," said Ignatius, "but what's the use of having me as a witness? People fight--that's
nothing extraordinary--I have often been quite close to Swedes and Turks, and people of all
shades of color."

I tried to explain to him the duties of a second; Ignatius would not, or could not understand
me. "Follow your own fashion," said he, "if I were to meddle in this affair, it would be to
announce to Ivan Mironoff, according to rule, that a plot is being made in the fortress for
the commission of a criminal action--one contrary to the interests of the crown."

I was alarmed, and begged Ignatius to say nothing to the Commandant. He gave me his word that
he would be silent, and I left him in peace. As usual I passed the evening at the Commandant's,
forcing myself to be calm and gay, in order not to awaken suspicions and to avoid questioning.
I confess that I had not the coolness of which people boast who have been in a similar position.
I was disposed to tenderness. Marie Mironoff seemed more attractive than ever. The idea that
perhaps I saw her for the last time, gave her a touching grace.

Alexis entered. I took him aside and told him of my conversation with Ignatius.

"What's the good of seconds," said he, dryly. "We can do without them."

We agreed to fight behind the haystack the next morning at six o'clock.

Seeing us talking amicably, Ignatius, full of joy, nearly betrayed us. "You should have done
that long ago, for a bad peace is better than a good quarrel."

"What! what! Ignatius," said the Captain's wife, who was playing patience in a corner, "I do
not quite understand?"

Ignatius, seeing my displeasure, remembered his promise, became confused and knew not what
to answer. Alexis came to his relief: "He approves of peace."

"With whom had you quarreled?" said she.

"With Peter Grineff--a few high words."

"Why?"

"For a mere nothing--a song."

"Fine cause for a quarrel! a song! Tell me how it happened."

"Willingly: Peter has recently been composing, and this morning he sang his song for me. Then
I chanted mine:

    'Daughter of the Captain, walk not forth at midnight.'

As we were not on the same note, Peter was angry, forgetting that every one is at liberty to
sing what he pleases."

The insolence of Alexis made me furious. No one but myself understood his allusions. From poetry
the conversation passed to poets in general. The Commandant observed that they were all debauchees
and drunkards, and advised me, as a friend, to renounce poetry as contrary to the service,
and leading to nothing good.

As the pretence of Alexis was to me insupportable, I hastened to take leave of the family.
In my own apartment I examined my sword, tried its point, and went to bed, having ordered Saveliitch
to wake me in the morning at six o'clock.

The next day at the appointed time I was behind the haystack awaiting my adversary, who did
not fail to appear. "We may be surprised," he said; "be quick." We laid aside our uniforms,
drew our swords from the scabbards, when Ignatius, followed by five pensioners, came out from
behind a haystack. He ordered us to repair to the presence of the Commandant. We obeyed. The
soldiers surrounded us. Ignatius conducted us in triumph, marching military step, with majestic
gravity. We entered the Commandant's house; Ignatius opened the folding doors, and exclaimed
with emphasis: "They are taken!"

Basilia ran toward us: "What does this mean? plotting an assassination in our fortress! Ivan
Mironoff, arrest them! Peter Grineff, Alexis, give up your swords to the garret. Peter, I did
not expect this of you; are you not ashamed? As for Alexis, it is quite different; he was transferred
to us from the Guards for having caused a soul to perish; and he does not believe in our blessed
Saviour."

Ivan Mironoff approved increasingly all that his wife said: "You see! You see! Basilia is right,
duels are forbidden by the military code."

Meantime Polacca had carried off our swords to the garret. I could not help smiling at this
scene. Alexis preserved all his gravity, and said to Basilia: "Notwithstanding all my respect
for you, I must say you take useless pains to subject us to your tribunal. Leave that duty
to Ivan Mironoff; it is his business."

"What! what! my dear sir," said the lady, "are not man and wife the same flesh and spirit?
Ivan Mironoff, are you trifling? Lock up these boys instantly; put them in separate rooms--on
bread and water, to expel this stupid idea of theirs. Let Father Garasim give them a penance
on order that they may repent before God and man."

Ivan Mironoff did not know what to do. Marie was extremely pale. The tempest, however, subsided
little by little. Basilia ordered us to embrace each other, and the maid was sent for our swords.
We left the house, having in appearance made friends. Ignatius re-conducted us.

"Are you not ashamed of yourself," I said to him, "to have denounced us to the Commandant,
after having given me your word you would not do so?"

"As God is holy, I said nothing to Ivan Mironoff. Basilia drew it all from me. She took all
the necessary measures without the knowledge of the Commandant. Thank God it finished as it
did." He went to his room; I remained with Alexis.

"Our affair can not end thus," I remarked.

"Certainly not," replied Alexis. "You shall pay me with your blood for your impertinence, but
as undoubtedly we shall be watched, let us feign for a few days. Until then, adieu!"

We separated as if nothing had happened. I returned to the Commandant's, and seated myself
as usual near Marie. Her father was absent and her mother busy with household duties. We spoke
in subdued tones. Marie reproached me gently for the pain my quarrel with Alexis gave her.
"My heart failed me," she said, "when I heard you were going to fight with swords. How strange
men are! For a word, they are ready to strangle each other, and sacrifice, not only their own
life, but even the honor and happiness of those who-- I am sure you did not begin the quarrel?
Alexis was the aggressor?"

"Why do you think so?"

"Because he is so sarcastic. I do not like him, and yet I would not displease him, although
he is quite disagreeable to me."

"What do you think, Marie, are you pleasing to him or not?"

Marie blushed. "It seems," said she, "that I please him."

"How do you know?"

"Because he made me an offer of marriage."

"He made you an offer of marriage! When?"

"Last year, two months before your arrival."

"You did not accept?"

"Evidently not, as you see. Alexis is a most intelligent man, of an excellent family and not
without fortune, but the mere idea that beneath the crown, on my marriage day, I should be
obliged to kiss him before every one! No! no! not for any thing in the world."

Marie's words opened my eyes. I understood the persistence of Alexis in aspersing her character.
He had probably remarked our mutual inclination, and was trying to turn us from each other.
The words which had provoked our quarrel seemed to me the more infamous, as instead of being
a vulgar joke, it was deliberate calumny. The desire to punish this shameless liar became so
strong that I waited impatiently the favorable moment. I had not long to wait. The next day,
occupied composing an elegy, biting my pen in the expectation of a rhyme, Alexis knocked at
my window. I put down my pen, took my sword, and went out of the house.

"Why defer?" said Alexis, "we are no longer watched, let us go down to the river-side; there
none will hinder us."

We set out in silence, and having descended a steep path, we stopped at the water's edge and
crossed swords. Alexis was more skillful than I in the use of arms, but I was stronger and
bolder. Mons. Beaupre, who had been, amongst other things, a soldier, had taught me fencing.
Alexis did not expect to find in me an adversary of so dangerous a character.

For some minutes neither gained any advantage over the other, but at last noticing that Alexis
was growing weak, I attacked him energetically, and almost drove him backward into the river,
when suddenly I heard my name pronounced in a high voice. Turning my head rapidly, I saw Saveliitch
running toward me down the path. As I turned my head, I felt a sharp thrust in the breast under
the right shoulder, and I fell, unconscious.

V. LOVE.

When I came to myself, I neither knew what had happened nor where I was. I felt very weak;
the room was strange, there was Saveliitch standing before me, a light in his hand, and some
one arranging the bandages that bound my chest and shoulder. Gradually I recalled my duel,
and easily divined that I had been wounded. The door at this instant moaned gently on its hinges.

"Well, how is he?" whispered a voice that made me start.

"Still in the same state," sighed Saveliitch, "now unconscious four days." I wanted to turn
on my bed, but I had not the strength. "Where am I?" said I, with effort, "who is here?" Marie
approached, and bending over me said, gently, "How do you feel?"

"Thank God, I am well. Is that Marie? tell me--?" I could not finish. Saveliitch uttered a
cry of joy, his delight showing plainly in his face. "He recovers! he recovers! Thanks to thee,
O God! Peter, how you frightened me!--four days! It is easy to talk--!"

Marie interrupted him: "Do not, Saveliitch, speak too much to him; he is still very weak."
She went out, shutting the door noiselessly. I must be in the Commandant's house, or Marie
could not come to see me. I wished to question Saveliitch, but the old man shook his head and
put his fingers in his ears. I closed my eyes from ill-humor--and fell asleep.

Upon awaking, I called Saveliitch; instead of him, I saw before me Marie, whose gentle voice
greeted me. I seized her hand and bathed it with my tears. Marie did not withdraw it, and suddenly
I felt upon my cheek the impression, humid and delicious, of her lips! A thrill shot through
my whole being.

"Dear, good Marie, be my wife, and make me the happiest of men!"

"In the name of heaven be calm," she said, withdrawing her hand, "your wound may reopen; for
my sake be careful."

She left the room. I was in a daze. I felt life returning. "She will be mine!" I kept repeating,
"she loves me!" I grew better, hour by hour. The barber of the regiment dressed my wounds,
for there was no other physician in the fortress, and thank God, he did not merely play the
doctor. Youth and nature completed the cure.

The Commandant's whole family surrounded me with care. Marie scarcely ever left me. I need
not say that I took the first favorable moment to continue my interrupted declaration. This
time Marie listened with more patience. She frankly acknowledged her affection for me. And
added that her parents would be happy in her happiness; "but," she continued, "think well of
it? Will there be no objection on the part of your family?"

I did not doubt my mother's tenderness, but knowing my father's character, I foresaw that my
love would not be received by him favorably, and that in all probability he would treat it
as one of my youthful follies. This I avowed plainly to Marie, but nevertheless I resolved
to write to my father as eloquently as possible, and ask his blessing on our marriage. I showed
the letter to Marie, who thought it so touching and convincing that she did not doubt of success,
and abandoned herself, with all the confidence of youth and love, to the feelings of her heart.

I made peace with Alexis in the first days of my convalescence. Ivan Mironoff said, reproaching
me for the duel: "You see, Peter, I ought to put you under arrest, but indeed you have been
well punished without that. Alexis is, by my orders, under guard in the barn, and his sword
is under lock and key in Basilia's keeping."

I was too happy to harbor spite, so I entreated for Alexis, and the kind Commandant, with his
wife's permission, consented to set him at liberty. Alexis came at once to see me. He expressed
regret for all that had happened, confessing that the fault was all his, and begged me to forget
the past. Being naturally incapable of revenge, I pardoned him, forgiving both our quarrel
and my wound. In his calumny I now saw the irritation of wounded vanity and despised love.
I generously forgave my unfortunate rival. As soon as completely cured I returned to my lodging.
I awaited impatiently the reply to my letter, not daring to hope, yet trying to stifle all
sad presentiments. I had not yet had an explanation with Basilia and her husband, but my suit
could not surprise them. Neither Marie nor I had concealed our feelings, and we were sure in
advance of their consent.

At last, one pleasant day Saveliitch came to my room, letter in hand. The address was written
in my father's hand. This sight prepared me for something grave, for usually my mother wrote
me, and he only added a few lines at the end. Long I hesitated to break the seal. I read again
and again the solemn superscription:

             "To my Son,
                 Peter Grineff,
                     Principality of Orenbourg,
                            Fortress of Belogorsk."

I tried to discover by my father's writing his mood of mind when he wrote that letter. At last
I broke that seal. I saw from the first lines that our hopes were crushed! Here is the letter:

"MY SON PETER: We received the 15th of this month the letter in which you ask our paternal
benediction and consent to your marriage with Mironoff's daughter. Not only have I no intention
of giving either my consent or benediction, but I have a great mind to go to you and punish
you for your childish follies, notwithstanding your officer's rank, because you have proved
that you are not worthy to bear the sword which was given you for the defense of your country,
and not for the purpose of fighting a duel with a fool of your own stamp. I shall write instantly
to Andrew Karlovitch to transfer you from the fortress of Belogorsk to some still more distant
place. Upon hearing of your wound your mother was taken ill, and is still confined to her bed.
What will become of you? I pray God to reform you, but can scarcely hope for so much from his
goodness. Your father, A.G."

The harsh expressions which my father had not spared, wounded me sorely; the contempt with
which he treated Marie seemed to me as unjust as it was undignified. Then the mere idea of
being sent from this fortress alarmed me; but above all, I grieved for my mother's illness.
Saveliitch came in for a share of my indignation, not doubting but that he informed my parents
of the duel. After having paced up and down my little chamber, I stopped suddenly before the
old man and said: "It seems that it is not enough that you caused my wound, and brought me
almost to the brink of the grave, but that you want to kill my mother too!"

Saveliitch was as motionless as if lightning had struck him. "Have mercy on me! my lord," said
he, "what do you deign to tell me? I caused your wound? God sees that I was running to put
my breast before you, to receive the sword of Alexis. This cursed age of mine hindered me.
But what have I done to your mother?"

"What have you done? Who charged you to write an accusation against me? Were you taken into
my service to play the spy on me?"

"I write an accusation?" replied the old man, quite broken down, "O God! King of heaven! Here,
read what the master writes me, and you shall see if I denounced thee." At the same time he
drew from his pocket a letter which he gave me, and I read what follows:

"Shame upon you, you old dog, that notwithstanding my strict orders you wrote me nothing regarding
my son, leaving to strangers the duty of telling me of his follies. Is it thus you do your
duty and fulfill your master's will? I shall send you to keep the pigs, for having concealed
the truth, and for your condescension to the young man. Upon receipt of this letter inform
me immediately of the state of his health, which is, I hear, improving, and tell me precisely
the place of his wound, and whether he has well attended."

Evidently Saveliitch was not in the wrong, and I had offended him by my suspicions and reproaches.
I asked him to forgive me, but the old man was inconsolable. "See to what I have lived!" he
repeated; "see what thanks I have merited from my masters for all my long services! I am an
old dog! I am a swine-herd, and more than all that, I caused your wound. No, no, Peter, I am
not in fault, it is the cursed Frenchman who taught thee to play with these steel blades, and
to stamp and dance, as if by thrusting and dancing you could defend yourself from a bad man."

Now, then, who had taken the pains to accuse me to my father? The General, Andrew Karlovitch?
He did not trouble himself much about me; moreover, Ivan Mironoff had not thought it worth
while to report my duel to him. My suspicions fell on Alexis. He only would find some advantage
in this information, the consequence of which might be my dismissal from the fortress and separation
from the Commandant's family. I went to tell every thing to Marie. She met me on the doorstep.

"What has happened to you? how pale you are!"

"All's over," I replied, handing her my father's letter.

It was her turn to blanch. Having read the letter she returned it, and said in a trembling
voice: "It was not my destiny. Your parents do not wish me in their family; may the will of
God be done! He knows better than we what is best for us. There is nothing to be done in the
matter, Peter; you, at least, may be happy."

"It shall not be so," I exclaimed, taking her hand. "You love me, I am ready for any fate.
Let us go and throw ourselves at your parents' feet. They are simple people; they are neither
haughty nor cruel; they will give us their benediction; we will marry; and in time, I am sure,
we will soften my father. My mother will intercede for us, and he will pardon me."

"No, Peter, I will not marry you without the benediction of your parents. You would not be
happy without their blessing. Let us submit to the will of God. If you meet another bride,
if you love her, may God be with you! I, Peter, I will pray for both of you." Tears interrupted
her, and she went away; I wished to follow her into the house, but I was not master of myself,
and I went to my own quarters. I was plunged in melancholy, when Saveliitch came to interrupt
my reflections.

"There, my lord," said he, presenting me a sheet of paper all covered with writing, "see if
I am a spy on my master, and if I try to embroil father and son."

I took the paper from his hand; it was his reply to my father's letter.

I could not help smiling at the old man's letter. I was in no condition to write to my father,
and to calm my mother his letter seemed sufficient.

From that day, Marie scarcely spoke to me, and even tried to avoid me. The Commandant's house
became insupportable, and I accustomed myself, little by little, to remain alone in my room.
At first Basilia reasoned with me, but seeing my persistency she let me alone. I saw Ivan Mironoff
only when the service required it. I had but rare interviews with Alexis, for whom my antipathy
increased, because I thought I discovered in him a secret enmity which confirmed my suspicions.
Life became a burden; I gave myself up to a melancholy which was fed by solitude and inaction.
Love burned on in silence and tortured me, more and more. I lost all taste for reading and
literature; I let myself become completely depressed; and I feared that I should either become
a lunatic or rush into dissipation, when events occurred that had great influence on my life
and give a strong and healthy tone to my mind.

VI. POUGATCHEFF.

Before beginning the recital of the strange events of which I was witness, I ought to say a
few words about the situation of affairs toward the end of the year 1773. The rich and vast
province of Orenbourg was inhabited by a number of tribes, half civilized, who had just recognized
the sovereignty of the Russian Czars. Their continual revolts, their impatience of law and
civilized life, their inconstancy and cruelty, demanded on the part of the government a constant
watchfulness to reduce them to obedience. Fortresses had been erected in favorable places,
and Cossacks, the former possessors of the shores of the Iaik, in many places formed a part
of the garrisons. But these very Cossacks, who should have guaranteed the peace and security
of their districts, were restless and dangerous subjects of the empire. In 1772 a riot occurred
in one of their chief towns. This riot was caused by the severity of the measures employed
by General Traubenberg to bring the army to obedience. The only result of these measures was
the barbarous murder of Traubenberg, a change of Imperial officers, and in the end, by force
of grape and canister, the suppression of the riot.

This happened shortly before my arrival at the fortress of Belogorsk. Then all seemed quiet.
But the authorities had too easily believed in the feigned repentance of the rebels, who nursed
their hate in silence, and only awaited a propitious moment to recommence the struggle.

I return to my story. Once evening, it was in the month of October, 1773, I was alone in the
house, listening to the whistling of the Autumn winds, and watching the clouds gliding rapidly
before the moon. An order came from the Commandant, calling me to his presence. I went that
instant. I found there Alexis, Ignatius and the Corporal of the Cossacks, but neither the wife
nor daughter of the Commandant. Confidential. I hereby inform you that the deserter and turbulent
Cossack of the Don, Imiliane Pougatcheff, after having been guilty of the unpardonable insolence
of usurping the name of the deceased Emperor Peter III, has assembled a troop of brigands,
disturbed the villages of the Iaik, and has even taken and destroyed several fortresses, at
the same time committing everywhere robberies and assassinations. Therefore, upon the receipt
of this, you will, Captain, bethink you of the measures to be taken to repulse the said robber
and usurper; and if possible, in case he turn his arms against the fortress confided to your
care, to completely exterminate him."

"It is easy to talk," said the Commandant, taking off his spectacles, and folding the paper;
"but we must use every precaution. The rascal seems strong, and we have only 130 men, even
adding the Cossacks, upon whom there is no dependence, be it said without reproach to thee,
Maxim." The Corporal of the Cossacks smiled. "Gentlemen, let us do our part; be vigilant, post
sentries, establish night patrols; in case of an attack, shut the gates and call out the soldiers.
Maxim, watch well your Cossacks. It is necessary to examine the cannon and clean it; and above
all to keep the secret, that no one in the fortress should know any thing before the time."

Having given his orders, Ivan Mironoff dismissed us. I went out with Alexis, speculating on
what we had heard. "What do you think of it? How will this end?" I asked him.

"God knows," he replied, "we shall see. At present there is no danger." And he began, as if
thinking, to hum a French air.

Notwithstanding our precautions the news of the apparition of Pougatcheff spread through the
fortress. However great the respect of Ivan Mironoff for his wife, he would not reveal to her
for anything in the world a military secret. When he had received the General's letter he very
adroitly rid himself of Basilia by telling her that the Greek priest had received from Orenbourg
extraordinary news which he kept a great mystery. Thereupon Basilia desired to pay a visit
to Accouline, the clergyman's wife, and by Mironoff's advice Marie went also. Master of the
situation, Ivan Mironoff locked up the maid in the kitchen and assembled us.

Basilia came home without news, and learned that during her absence a council of war had been
held, and that Polacca was imprisoned in the kitchen. She suspected that her husband had deceived
her, and overwhelmed him with questions. He was prepared for the attack, and stoutly replied
to his curious better-half:

"You see, my dear, the women about the country have been using straw to kindle their fires;
now as that might be dangerous, I assembled my officers, and gave them orders to prevent these
women lighting fires with anything but fagots and brushwood."

"And why did you lock up Polacca in the kitchen till my return?" Ivan Mironoff had not foreseen
that question, and muttered some incoherent words. Basilia saw at once her husband's perfidy,
but knowing that she could extract nothing from him at that moment, she ceased her questioning,
and spoke of the pickled cucumbers which Accouline knew how to prepare in a superior fashion.
That night Basilia never closed an eye, unable to imagine what it was that her husband knew
that she could not share with him.

The next day, returning from mass, she saw Ignatius cleaning the cannon, taking out rags, pebbles,
bits of wood, and all sorts of rubbish which the small boys had stuffed there. "What means
these warlike preparations?" thought the Commandant's wife? "Is an attack from the Kirghis
feared? Is it possible that Mironoff would hide from me so mere a trifle?" She called Ignatius,
determined to know the secret that excited her woman's curiosity. Basilia began by making some
remarks about household matters, like a judge who begins his interrogation with questions foreign
to the affair, in order to reassure the accused, and throw him off his guard. Then having paused
a moment she sighed and shook her head, saying: "O God! what news! what news! What will become
of us?"

"My dear lady," said Ignatius, "the Lord is merciful; we have soldiers and plenty of powder;
I have cleaned the cannon. We may repulse this Pougatcheff. If the Lord is with us, the wolf
will eat no one here."

"Who is Pougatcheff?" asked the Commandant's wife.

Ignatius saw that he had gone too far, and he bit his tongue. But it was too late. Basilia
constrained him to tell her all, having given her word to keep the secret. She kept her word,
and indeed told no one except Accoulina, whose cow was still on the steppe and might be carried
off by the brigands. Soon every one talked of Pougatcheff, the current reports being very different.
The Commandant sent out the Corporal to pick up information about him in all the neighboring
villages and little forts. The Corporal returned after an absence of two days, and declared
that he had seen on the steppe, sixty versts from the fortress, a great many fires, and that
he had heard the Bashkirs say that an innumerable force was advancing. He could not tell anything
definitely, having been afraid to venture farther.

Great agitation was soon after this observed amongst the Cossacks of our garrison. They assembled
in groups in the streets, speaking in a low tone amongst themselves, and dispersing as soon
as they perceived a dragoon or other Russian soldier. Orders were given to watch them. Zoulac,
a baptized Kalmouk, made a very grave revelation to the Commandant. According to the Kalmouk,
the Cossack made a false report; for to his comrades the perfidious Corporal said that he had
advanced to the rebel camp, had been presented to their rebel chief, had kissed his hand and
conversed with him. The Commandant ordered the Corporal under arrest, and replaced him by the
Kalmouk. This change was received by the Cossacks with visible discontent. They openly murmured
and Ignatius, when executing the Commandant's order, heard them say, with his own ears, "wait,
garrison rat, wait!"

The Commandant decided to examine the Corporal that same day, but he had escaped, no doubt,
by the aid of his brother Cossacks. Another event increased the Captain's uneasiness. A Bashkir
was seized bearing seditious letters. Upon this occasion, the Commandant decided to call at
once a council, and in order to do so, wished to send away his wife under some specious pretext.
But as Mironoff was the simplest and most truthful of men, he could think of no other device
than that already employed.

"You see, Basilia," said he, coughing several times, "Father Garasim has, it is said, been
to the city--"

"Silence! silence!" interrupted his wife; "you are going to call another council and talk in
my absence of Imiliane Pougatcheff, but this time you can not deceive me."

The Captain stared; "Eh! well! my dear," said he, "since you know all, stay; we may as well
speak before you."

"You cannot play the fox," said his wife; "send for the officers."

We assembled again. The Commandant read, before his wife, Pougatcheff's proclamation, written
by some half-educated Cossack. The brigand declared to us his intention of marching directly
upon our fortress, inviting the Cossacks and soldiers to join him, and advising the chiefs
not to resist, threatening, in that case, extremest torture. The proclamation was written in
vulgar but energetic terms, and must have produced an impression upon simple-minded people.

"What a rascal!" exclaimed the Captain's wife. "Just see what he proposes. To go out and meet
him and lay our flags at his feet. Ah! the son of a dog! He does not know that we have been
forty years in service, and that, thank God, we have seen all sorts of military life. Is it
possible to find a Commandant cowardly enough to obey this robber?"

"It ought not to be," replied the Captain, "but it is said that the villain has taken possession
of several fortress."

"It appears he is quite strong," said Alexis.

"We shall instantly know his real force," continued the Commandant; "Basilia, give me the key
of the garret. Ignatius, bring the Bashkir here, and tell Zoulac to bring the rods."

"Wait a little, my dear," said the Commandant's wife, leaving her seat; "let me take Marie
out of the house, or else she will hear the screams and be frightened. And, to tell the truth,
I am, myself, not very curious about such investigations. Until I see you again, adieu." But
in the time of our story no one doubted the necessity of torture, neither the judges nor the
accused themselves. For this reason the Captain's order did not astonish any of us. Ignatius
went for the Bashkir, and a few minutes later he was brought to the waiting-room. The Commandant
ordered him into the council-room where we were.

The Bashkir crossed the threshold with difficulty, for his feet were shackled. He took off
his high Cossack cap and stood near the door. I looked at him and shuddered, involuntarily.
Never shall I forget that man; he seemed at least seventy years of age, and had neither nose
nor ears. His head was shaved; a few sparse gray hairs took the place of beard. "You are an
old wolf, I see; you have already been caught in our snares. This is not your first offense,
for your head is so well planed off."

The old Bashkir was silent, and looked at the Commandant with an air of complete imbecility.

"Well! why are you silent?" continued the Captain; "do you not understand Russian? Zoulac,
ask him, in your tongue, who sent him into our fortress."

The Kalmouk repeated in the Tartar language the Captain's question. But the Bashkir looked
at him with the same expression and without answering a word.

"I will make you answer," exclaimed the Captain, with a Tartar oath. "Come, take off his striped
dressing-gown, his fool's garment, and scourge him well."

Two pensioners commenced to remove the clothing from the shoulders of the old man. Then, sore
distress was vividly depicted on the face of the unfortunate man. He looked on all sides, like
a poor little animal caught by children. But when one of the pensioners seized his hands to
turn them around his neck and lift up the old man on his shoulders; when Zoulac took the rods
and raised his hand to strike, then the Bashkir uttered a low, but penetrating moan, and raising
his head, opened his mouth, where, in place of a tongue, moved a short stump!

We were still debating, when Basilia rushed breathlessly into the room with a terrified air.
"What has happened to you?" asked the Commandant, surprised.

"Misfortune! misfortune!" replied she. "A fort was taken this morning; Father Garasim's boy
has just returned. He saw how it was captured. The Commandant and all the officers are hanged,
all the soldiers made prisoners, and the rebels are coming here."

This unexpected news made a deep impression on me, for I knew the Commandant of that fortress.
Two months ago, the young man, traveling with his bride coming from Orenbourg, had paid a visit
to Captain Mironoff. The fort he commanded was only twenty-five versts from ours, so that from
hour to hour we might expect an attack from Pougatcheff.

My imagination pictured the fate of Marie, and I trembled for her.

"Listen, Captain Mironoff," said I to the Commandant, "our duty is to defend the fortress to
our last breath; that is understood, but the safety of the women must be thought of; send them
to a more distant fortress,--to Orenbourg, if the route be still open."

Mironoff turned to his wife. "You see my dear! indeed it would be well to send you somewhere
farther off until we shall have defeated the rebels."

"What nonsense!" replied she. "Where is the fortress that balls have not reached? In what respect
is our fortress unsafe? Thank God, we have lived here twenty and one years. We have seen Bashkirs
and Kirghis; Pougatcheff can not be worse than they."

"My dear, stay if you will, since your faith is so great in our fortress. But what shall we
do with Marie? It will be all well if we can keep off the robber, or if help reach us in time.
If the fortress, however, be taken--"

Basilia could only stammer a few words, and was silent, choked by her feelings.

"No, Basilia," continued the Commandant, who remarked that his words made a deep impression
on his wife, perhaps for the first time in his life, "it is not advisable that Marie stay here.
Let us send her to Orenbourg, to her god-mother's. That is a well-manned fortress, with stone
walls and plenty of cannon. I would advise you to go there yourself; think what might happen
to you were your fortress to be taken by assault."

"Well! well! let us send Marie away," said the Captain's wife, "but do not dream of asking
me to go, for I will do nothing of the kind. It is not becoming, in my old age, to separate
myself from thee and seek a solitary grave in a strange place. We have lived together; let
us die together."

"You are right," said the Commandant. "Go, and equip Marie; there is no time to lose; tomorrow,
at the dawn of day, she shall set out; she must have a convoy, though indeed there is no one
to spare. Where is she?"

"She is at Accoulina's," said his wife. "She fainted upon hearing that the fortress had been
taken."

Basilia went to prepare for her daughter's departure. The discussion still continued at the
Commandant's, but I took no further part in it. Marie reappeared at supper with eyes red from
tears. We supped in silence and rose from the table sooner than usual. Having bade the family
good night, each one sought his room. I forgot my sword, on purpose, and went back for it;
I anticipated finding Marie alone. In truth she met me at the door and gave me my sword.

"Adieu, Peter," she said, weeping, "they send me to Orenbourg. Be happy. Perhaps God will permit
us to meet again; if not--"

She burst into tears. I folded her in my arms.

"Adieu, my angel!" I said, "adieu my cherished, my beloved; what ever happens, be sure that
my last thought, my last prayer, will be for thee." Leaning of my breast, Marie wept. I kissed
her and rushed out.

VII. THE ASSAULT.

I could not sleep during the night, and did not even undress. I intended to be at the fortress
gates at day-dawn to see Marie set out, and bid her a last adieu. I was completely changed.
Excitement was less painful than my former melancholy, for with the grief of separation there
mingled vague but secret hope, impatient expectation of danger, and a high ambition. Night
passed quickly. I was on the point of going out, when my door opened, and the Corporal entered,
saying that our Cossacks had deserted the fortress during the night, forcing with them Zoulac,
the Christian Kalmouk, and that all around our ramparts, unknown people were riding. The idea
that Marie had not been able to get off, froze me with terror. I gave, in haste, a few instructions
to the Corporal, and ran to the Commandant's.

Day was breaking. I was going down the street swiftly when I heard my name called. I stopped.

"Where are you going, dare I ask?" said Ignatius, catching up with me; "the Captain is on the
rampart and sends me for you. Pougatcheff is here."

"Is Marie gone?" I said, shuddering.

"She was not ready in time; communication with Orenbourg is cut off; the fortress is surrounded.
Peter, this is bad work."

We went to the rampart--a small height formed by nature and fortified by a palisade. The garrison
was there under arms. The cannon had been dragged there the evening before. The Commandant
was walking up and down before his little troop--the approach of danger had restored to the
old warrior extraordinary vigor. On the steppe, not far from the fortress, there were some
twenty horsemen, who looked like Cossacks; but amongst them were a few Bashkirs, easily recognized
by their caps and quivers. The Commandant passed before the ranks of his small army and said
to the soldiers: "Come, boys, let us fight today for our mother the Empress, and show the world
that we are brave men and faithful to our oath."

The soldiers, with loud shouts, testified their good will. Alexis was standing by me examining
the enemy. The people on the steppe, seeing, no doubt, some movement in our fort, collected
in groups and spoke amongst themselves. The Commandant ordered Ignatius to point the cannon
upon them, he himself applying the light. The ball whistled over their heads without doing
them any harm. The horsemen dispersed at once, setting off on a gallop, and the steppe became
deserted. At this moment Basilia appeared on the rampart, followed by Marie, who would not
leave her.

"Well," said the Captain's wife, "how is the battle going? Where is the enemy?"

"The enemy is not far off," replied Ivan, "but if God wills it, all will be well; and thou,
Marie, art thou afraid?"

"No, papa," said Marie, "I am more afraid by myself in the house." She glanced at me, and tried
to smile. I pressed my sword, remembering that I had received it from her on the preceding
eve, as if for her defense. My heart was on fire. I fancied myself her knight, and longed to
prove myself worthy of her trust. I awaited the decisive moment impatiently.

Suddenly coming from behind a hill, eight versts from the fortress, appeared new groups of
horsemen, and soon the whole steppe was covered by men armed with lances and arrows. Amongst
them, wearing a scarlet cafetan, sword in hand, could be distinguished a man mounted on a white
horse. This was Pougatcheff himself. He halted, was surrounded by his followers, and very soon,
probably by his orders, four men left the crowd and galloped to our ramparts. We recognized
among them our traitors. One of them raised a sheet of paper above his cap and another carried
on the point of his lance Zoulac's head, which he threw to us over the palisade. The poor Kalmouk's
head rolled at the feet of the Commandant.

The traitors shouted to us: "Do not fire, come out and receive the Czar. The Czar is here."

"Fire!" shouted the Captain as sole reply.

The soldiers discharged their pieces. The Cossack who held the letter, tottered and fell from
his horse; the others fled. I glanced at Marie. Petrified by horror at the sight of the Kalmouk's
head, dizzy from the noise of the discharge, she seemed lifeless. The Commandant ordered the
Corporal to take the letter from the hand of the dead Cossack. Ignatius sallied out and returned,
leading by the bridle the man's horse. He gave the letter to Ivan, who read it in a low voice
and tore it up. Meantime the rebels were preparing for an attack. Very soon balls whistled
about our ears, and arrows fell around us, buried deep in the ground.

"Basilia," said the Captain, "women have nothing to do here; take away Marie; you see the child
is more dead than alive." Basilia, whom the sound of the balls had rendered more yielding,
glanced at the steppe where much movement was visible, and said: "Ivan, life and death are
from God; bless Marie; come, child, to thy father."

Pale and trembling, Marie came and knelt, bending low before him. The old Commandant made three
times the sign of the cross over her, then raising, kissed her, and said in a broken voice:
"Oh! my dear Marie! pray to God, he will never abandon thee. If an honest man seek thee, may
God give you both love and goodness. Live together as we have lived; my wife and I. Adieu!
my dear Marie! Basilia, take her away quickly."

Marie put her arms around his neck and sobbed. The Captain's wife, in tears, said: "Embrace
us also; adieu, Ivan; if ever I have crossed you, forgive me."

"Adieu! adieu! my dear," said the Commandant, kissing his old companion. "Come! enough! go
to the house, and if you have time dress Marie in her best; let her wear a sarafan, embroidered
in gold, as is our custom for burial."

Ivan Mironoff returned to us, and fixed all his attention upon the enemy. The rebels collected
around their chief and suddenly began to advance. "Be firm, boys," said the Commandant, "the
assault begins." At that instant savage war-cries were heard. The rebels were approaching the
fortress with their accustomed fleetness. Our cannon was charged with grape and canister. The
Commandant let them come within short range, and again put a light to his piece. The shot struck
in the midst of the force, which scattered in every direction. Only their chief remained in
advance, and he, waving his sabre, seemed to be rallying them. Their piercing shouts, which
had ceased an instant, redoubled again. "Now, children," ordered the Captain, "open the gate,
beat the drum, and advance! Follow me, for a sortie!"

The Captain, Ignatius and I were in an instant beyond the parapet. But the frightened garrison
had not moved from the square. "What are you doing, my children?" shouted the Captain; "if
we must die, let us die; the imperial service demands it!"

At this moment the rebels fell upon us, and forced the entrance to the citadel. The drum was
silent; the garrison threw down their arms. I had been knocked down, but I rose and entered,
pell-mell, with the crowds into the fortress. I saw the Commandant wounded on the head, and
closed upon by a small troop of bandits, who demanded the keys. I was running to his aid when
several powerful Cossacks seized me and bound me with their long sashes, crying out: "Wait
there, traitor to the Czar, till we know what to do with you." Suddenly, shouts announced that
the Czar was on the square, awaiting to receive the oaths of the prisoners.

Pougatcheff was seated in an arm-chair on the steps of the Commandant's house. He was robed
in an elegant Cossack cafetan embroidered on the seams.

On the square itself, a gallows was hastily erected. When we approached, the Bashkirs opened
a passage through the crowd and presented us to Pougatcheff. The bells ceased; the deepest
silence prevailed. "Which is the Commandant?" asked the usurper. Our Corporal came out of the
crowd and pointed to Mironoff. Pougatcheff looked at the old man with a terrible expression,
and said to him: "How did you dare to oppose me, your emperor?"

The Commandant, weakened by his wound, collected all his energy, and said, in a firm but faint
voice: "You are not my emperor; you are a usurper and a brigand."

Pougatcheff frowned and raised his white handkerchief. Immediately the old Captain was seized
by Cossacks and dragged to the gibbet. Astride the cross-beam of the gallows, sat the mutilated
Bashkirs who we had questioned; he held a rope in his hand, and I saw, an instant after, poor
Ivan Mironoff suspended in the air. Then Ignatius was brought up before Pougatcheff.

"Take the oath to the emperor, Peter Fedorovitch."

"You are not our emperor," replied the Lieutenant, repeating his Captain's words, "you are
a brigand and a usurper."

Pougatcheff again made a signal with his handkerchief, and the kind Ignatius hung beside his
ancient chief. It was my turn. I looked boldly at Pougatcheff, preparing to repeat the words
of my brave comrades, when to my inexpressible astonishment I saw Alexis amongst the rebels.
He had had time to cut his hair round, and exchange his uniform for a Cossack cafetan. He approached
Pougatcheff and whispered to him. "Let him be hung," said Pougatcheff, not deigning to look
at me. A rope was put around my neck. I uttered a prayer to God in a low voice, expressing
sincere repentance for my sins, and imploring him to save all those dear to my heart. I was
led beneath the gibbet. A shout was heard, "Stop! Stop!" The executioners paused. I looked.
Saveliitch was kneeling at Pougatcheff's feet. "O my lord and master," said my dear old serf,
"what do you want with that nobleman's child? Set him free, you will get a good ransom for
his life; but for an example, and to frighten the rest, command that I, an old man, shall be hung."

Pougatcheff made a sign. They unbound me at once. "Our emperor pardons you," they said. At
the moment I did not know that my deliverance was a cause for joy or for sorrow. My mind was
too confused. I was taken again before the usurper and made to kneel at his feet. Pougatcheff
offered me his muscular hand. "Kiss his hand! Kiss his hand!" cried out all around me. But
I would have preferred the most atrocious torture to a degradation so infamous. "My dear Peter,"
whispered Saveliitch, who was standing behind me, "do not play the obstinate; what does it
cost? Kiss the brigand's hand."

I did not move. Pougatcheff drew back his hand: "His lordship is stupefied with joy; raise
him up," said he. I was at liberty. Then I witnessed the continuation of the infamous comedy.

The inhabitants began to take the oath. They went one by one to kiss the cross and salute the
usurper. After them came the garrison soldiers. The company's tailor, armed with his great
blunt-pointed shears, cut off their queues; they shook their heads and kissed the hand of Pougatcheff,
who declared them pardoned and received into his troops. This lasted for nearly three hours.
At last Pougatcheff rose from his arm-chair and went down the steps, followed by his chiefs.
A white horse richly caparisoned was led to him; tow Cossacks helped him into the saddle. He
signified to Father Garasim that he would dine with him. At this moment wild heart-rending
shrieks from a woman filled the air. Basilia, without her mantle, her hair in disorder, was
dragged out on the steps; one the brigands had on her mantle; the others were carrying away
her chests, her linen, and other household goods. "O good men," she cried, "let me go, take
me to Ivan Mironoff." Suddenly she saw the gibbet and recognized her husband. "Wretches," she
cried, "What have you done? O my light, Ivan! Brave soldier! no Prussian ball, nor Turkish
sabre killed thee, but a vile condemned deserter."

"Silence that old sorceress," said Pougatcheff.

A young Cossack struck her with his sabre on the head. She fell dead at the foot of the steps.
Pougatcheff rode off, all the people following.

VIII. THE UNEXPECTED VISIT.

I stood in the vacant square, unable to collect my thoughts, disturbed by so many terrible
emotions. Uncertainty about Marie's fate tortured me. Where is she? Is she concealed? Is her
retreat safe? I went to the Commandant's house. It was in frightful disorder; the chairs, tables,
presses had been burned up and the dishes were in fragments. I rushed up the little stairs
leading to Marie's room, which I entered for the first time in my life. A lamp still burned
before the shrine which had enclosed the sacred objects revered by all true believers. The
clothes-press was empty, the bed broke up. The robbers had not taken the little mirror hanging
between the door and the window. What had become of the mistress of this simple, virginal abode?
A terrible thought flashed through my mind. Marie in hands of the brigands! My heart was torn,
and I cried aloud: "Marie! Marie!" I heard a rustle. Polacca, quite pale, came from her hiding-place
behind the clothes-press.

"Ah! Peter," said she, clasping her hands, "what a day! what horrors!"

"Marie?" I asked impatiently, "Marie--where is she?"

"The young lady is alive," said the maid, "concealed at Accoulina's, at the house of the Greek
priest."

"Great God!" I cried, with terror, "Pougatcheff is there!"

I rushed out of the room, made a bound into the street and ran wildly to the priest's house.
It was ringing with songs, shouts and laughter. Pougatcheff was at table there with his men.
Polacca had followed me; I sent her in to call out Accoulina secretly. Accoulina came into
the waiting-room, an empty bottle in her hand.

"In the name of heaven, where is Marie?" I asked with agitation.

"The little dove is lying on my bed behind the partition. Oh! Peter, what danger we have just
escaped! The rascal had scarcely seated himself at table than the poor thing moaned. I thought
I should die of fright. He heard her. 'Who is moaning in your room, old woman?' 'My niece,
Czar.' 'Let me see your niece, old woman.' I saluted him humbly; 'My niece, Czar, has not strength
to come before your grace.' 'Then I will go and see her.' And will you believe it, he drew
the curtains and looked at our dove, with his hawk's eyes! The child did not recognize him.
Poor Ivan Mironoff! Basilia! Why was Ignatius taken, and you spared? What do you think of Alexis?
He has cut his hair and now hobnobs with them in there. When I spoke of my sick niece he looked
at me as if he would run me through with his knife. But he said nothing, and we must be thankful
for that."

The drunken shouts of the guests, and the voice of Father Garasim now resounded together; the
brigands wanted more wine, and Accoulina was needed. "Go back to your house, Peter," said she,
"woe to you, if you fall into his hands!"

She went to serve her guests; I, somewhat quieted, returned to my room. Crossing the square,
I saw some Bashkirs stealing the boots from the bodies of the dead. I restrained my useless
anger. The brigands had been through the fortress and had pillaged the officers' houses.

I reached my lodging. Saveliitch met me at the threshold. "Thank God!" he cried. "Ah! master,
the rascals have taken everything; but what matter, since they did not take your life. Did
you not recognize their chief, master?"

"No, I did not; who is he?"

"What, my dear boy, have you forgotten the drunkard who cheated you out of the touloup the
day of the snow-drift--a hare-skin touloup?--the rascal burst all the seams putting it on."

My eyes were opened. The resemblance between the guide and Pougatcheff was striking. I now
understood the pardon accorded me. I recalled with gratitude the lucky incident. A youth's
touloup given to a vagabond had saved my neck; and this drunkard, capturing fortress, had shaken
the very empire.

"Will you not deign to eat something?" said Saveliitch, true to his instincts; "there is nothing
in the house, it is true, but I will find something and prepare it for you."

Left alone, I began to reflect that not to leave the fortress, now subject to the brigand,
or to join his troops, would be unworthy of an officer. Duty required me to go and present
myself where I could still be useful to my country. But love counseled me, with no less force,
to stay near Marie, to be her protector and champion. Although I foresaw a near and inevitable
change in the march of events, still I could not, without trembling, contemplate the danger
of her position.

My reflections were interrupted by the entrance of a Cossack, who came to announce that the
"great Czar" called me to his presence. "Where is he?" I asked, preparing to obey. "In the
commandant's house," replied the Cossack. "After dinner the Czar went to the vapor baths. It
must be confessed that all his ways are imperial! He can do more than others; at dinner he
deigned to eat two roast milk-pigs; afterward at the bath he endured the highest degree of
heat; even the attendant could not stand it; he handed the brush to another and was restored
to consciousness only by the application of cold water. It is said that in the bath, the marks
of the true Czar were plainly seen on his breast--a picture of his own face and a double-headed
eagle."

I did not think it necessary to contradict the Cossack, and I followed him to the Commandant's,
trying to fancy in advance my interview with Pougatcheff, and its result. The reader may imagine
that I was not quite at ease. Night was falling as I reached the house. The gibbet with its
victims still stood, black and terrible. The poor body of our good Basilia was lying under
the steps, near which two Cossacks mounted guard. He who had brought me, entered to announce
my arrival; he returned at once, and led me to the room where the evening before I had taken
leave of Marie. At a table covered with a cloth, and laden with bottles and glasses, sat Pougatcheff,
surrounded by some ten Cossack chiefs in colored caps and shirts, with flushed faces and sparkling
eyes, the effect, no doubt, of the wine-cup.

I saw neither of our traitors, Alexis or the Corporal, amongst them.

"Ah! your lordship, it is you?" said their chief, on seeing me. "Be welcome! Honor and place
at the table!"

The guests drew closer together. I took a place at the end of the table. My neighbor, a young
Cossack of slender form and handsome face, poured out a bumper of brandy for me. I did not
taste it. I was busy considering the assembly. Pougatcheff was seated in the place of honor,
elbow on table, his heavy, black beard resting upon his muscular hand. His features, regular
and handsome, had no ferocious expression. He often spoke to a man of some fifty years, calling
him now Count, again Uncle. All treated each other as comrades, showing no very marked deference
for their chief. They talked of the assault that morning; of the revolt, its success, and of
their next operations. Each one boasted of his prowess, gave his opinions, and freely contradicted
Pougatcheff. In this strange council of war, they resolved to march upon Orenbourg, a bold
move, but justified by previous successes. The departure was fixed for the next day. Each one
drank another bumper, and rising, took leave of Pougatcheff. I wished to follow them, but the
brigand said: "Wait, I want to speak to you."

Pougatcheff looked at me fixedly in silence for a few seconds, winking his left eye with the
most cunning, mocking expression. At last he burst into a long peal of laughter, so hearty,
that I, just from seeing him, began to laugh, without knowing why.

"Well, my lord," said he, "confess that you were frightened, when my boys put the rope around
your neck? The sky must have seemed to you then as big as a sheep-skin. And if not for your
servant, you would have been swinging up there from the cross-beam; but at that very instant
I recognized the old owl. Would you have thought that the man who led you to a shelter on the
steppe was the great Czar himself?" Saying these words, he assumed a grave and mysterious air.
"You have been very guilty," continued he, "but I have pardoned you, for having done me a kindness,
when I was obliged to hide from my enemies. I shall load you with favors, when I shall have
regained my empire. Do you promise to serve me with zeal?"

The bandit's question and impudence made me smile.

"Why do you laugh?" said he, frowning, "do you not believe that I am the great Czar? Answer
frankly."

I was troubled. I could not recognize a vagabond as the emperor; to call him an impostor to
his face was to doom myself to death; and the sacrifice which I was ready to make under the
gibbet that morning, before all the people, in the first flush of indignation, seemed now a
useless bravado. Pougatcheff awaited my answer in fierce silence. At last (I still remember
with satisfaction that duty triumphed over human weakness) I replied to Pougatcheff.

"I will tell you the truth and let you decide. Should I recognize you as the Czar, as you are
a man of intelligence, you would see that I am lying."

"Then who am I? in your opinion."

"God knows, but whoever you are, you are playing a dangerous game."

Pougatcheff gave me a sharp, quick glance. "You do not believe that I am the emperor, Peter
III? Be it so. Have not bold men succeeded before me and obtained the crown? Think what you
please about me, but stay with me. What matters it whom you serve? Success is right. Serve
under me, and I will make you a field-marshal, a prince. What say you?"

"No," said I. "I am a nobleman. I have taken an oath to her majesty, the Empress; I can not
serve with you. If truly you wish me well, send me to Orenbourg."

Pougatcheff reflected. "If I send you there, you will, at least, promise not to bear arms against
me?"

"How can I promise that? If I am ordered to march against you, I must go. You are now a chief;
you desire your subordinates to obey you. No, my life is in your hand; if you give me liberty,
thanks; if you put me to death, may God judge you."

My frankness pleased him. "Be it so," said he, slapping me on the shoulders, "pardon or punish
to the end. You can go the four quarters of the world, and do as you like. Come tomorrow, and
bid me good-bye. Now go to bed--I require rest myself."

I went out into the street. The night was clear and cold; the moon and stars shone out in all
their brightness, lighting up the square and the gibbet. All was quiet and dark in the rest
of the fortress. At the inn some lights were visible, and belated drinkers broke the stillness
by their shouts. I glanced at Accoulina's house; the doors and windows were closed, and all
seemed perfectly quiet there. I went to my room, and found Saveliitch deploring my absence.
I told him of my freedom. "Thanks to thee, O God!" said he, making the sign of the cross; "tomorrow
we shall set out at daybreak. I have prepared something for you; eat and then sleep till morning,
tranquil as if in the bosom of the Good Shepherd."

I followed his advice, and after having supped, fell asleep on the bare floor, as fatigued
in mind as in body.

IX. THE SEPARATION.

The drum awoke me early the next morning. I went out on the square. Pougatcheff's troops were
there, falling into rank, around the gibbet, to which still hung the victims of yesterday.
The Cossacks were mounted; the infantry and artillery, with our single gun, were accoutred
ready for the march. The inhabitants were also assembled there awaiting the usurper. My eyes
sought the body of our good Basilia. It had been dragged aside and covered with an old bark
mat. At last Pougatcheff came out on the steps, and saluted the crowd. All heads were bared.
One of the chiefs handed him a bag of copper coin, which he threw by the handful among the
people. Perceiving me in the crowd, he signed to me to approach.

"Listen," said he, "go at once to Orenbourg, and say from me, to the Governor and all the Generals,
that I shall be there in a week. Counsel them to receive me with submission and filial love,
otherwise they shall not escape the direst torture. A pleasant journey to you." The principal
followers of Pougatcheff surrounded him, Alexis amongst others. The usurper turned to the people,
and pointing to Alexis, said: "Behold your new Commandant; obey him in every thing; he is responsible
for you and for the fortress."

The words made me shudder. What would become of Marie? Pougatcheff descended the steps and
vaulted quickly into his saddle without the aid of his attendant Cossacks. At that moment Saveliitch
came out of the crowd, approached the usurper, and presented him a sheet of paper.

"What is this?" asked Pougatcheff, with dignity.

"Read, you will deign to see," replied the serf.

Pougatcheff examined the paper. "You write very illegibly; where is my Secretary?"

A boy in corporal's uniform came running to the brigand. "Read aloud," said he. I was curious
to know for what purpose the old man had written to Pougatcheff. The Secretary began to spell
out in a loud voice what follows:

"Two dressing-gowns, one in percale, the other in striped silk, six roubles."

"What does this mean?" said Pougatcheff, frowning.

"Command him to read on," replied Saveliitch, with perfect calmness.

The Secretary continued: "One uniform in fine green cloth, seven roubles; one pair of white
cloth pantaloons, five roubles; twelve shirts of Holland linen, with cuffs, ten roubles; one
case containing a tea-service, two roubles."

"What nonsense is this?" said Pougatcheff.

"What have I to do with tea-sets and Holland cuffs?"

Saveliitch coughed to clear his voice, and began to explain: "That, my lord, deign to understand,
is the bill of my master's goods carried off by the thieves."

"What thieves?" asked Pougatcheff, with a terrible air.

"Pardon me," said Saveliitch. "Thieves? No, they were not thieves; my tongue slipped; yet your
boys went through everything and carried off plenty. That can not be denied. Do not be angry.
The horse has four legs and yet he stumbles. Command that he read to the end."

"Well, read," said Pougatcheff.

"One Persian blanket, one quilt of wadded silk, four roubles; one pelisse of fox-skin, covered
with red ratine, forty roubles; one small touloup of hare-skin left with your grace, on the
steppe, fifteen roubles."

"What?" cried Pougatcheff, with flashing eyes.

I must say I feared for the old man, who was beginning new explanations, when the brigand interrupted
him:

"How dare you annoy me with these trifles?" said he, snatching the paper from the Secretary
and throwing it in the old man's face. "You have been despoiled! old fool! great harm! You
ought to thank God that you are not hanging up there, with the other rebels, both you and your
master. I'll give you a hare-skin touloup! Do you know that I will have you flayed alive, that
touloups may be made of you?"

"As you please," replied Saveliitch; "but I am not a free man, and I am responsible for my
master's goods."

Pougatcheff, who was evidently playing the magnanimous, turned his head and set off without
a word. Alexis and the other chiefs followed him. The whole army left the fortress in good
order, the people forming an escort. I stayed alone on the square with Saveliitch, who held
in his hand the bill and considered it with deep regret. I could not help laughing.

"Laugh, my lord, laugh, but when the household is to be furnished again, we shall see if it
be a laughing matter."

I went to learn of Marie Mironoff. Accoulina met me and told me a sad piece of news. During
the night a burning fever had seized the poor girl. Accoulina took me into her chamber. The
invalid was delirious and did not recognize me. I was shocked by the change in her countenance.
The position of this sorrowing orphan, without defenders, alarmed me as much as my inability
to protect grieved me. Alexis, above all, was to be feared. Chief, invested with the usurper's
authority, in the fortress with this unhappy girl, he was capable of any crime. What ought
I to do to deliver her? To set out at once for Orenbourg, to hasten the deliverance of Belogorsk,
and to co-operate in it, if possible. I took leave of Father Garasim and Accoulina, recommending
to them Marie, who I already looked upon as my wife. I kissed the young girl's hand, and left
the room.

"Adieu, Peter Grineff," said Accoulina. "Do not forget us. Except you, Marie has no support
or consolation." Choked by emotion, I did not reply. Out on the square, I stopped an instant
before the gibbet. With bare head I reverently saluted the loyal dead, and took the road to
Orenbourg, accompanied by Saveliitch, who would not abandon me. Thus plunged in thought, I
walked on. Hearing horses galloping behind me, I turned my head and saw a Cossack from the
fortress leading a horse, and making signs to me that I should wait. I recognized our Corporal.
Having caught up with us, he dismounted from his own horse, and giving me the bridle of the
other, said: "Our Czar makes you a gift of a horse, and a pelisse from his own shoulder." To
the saddle was tied a sheep-skin touloup. I put it on, mounted the horse, taking Saveliitch
up behind me. "You see, my lord," said my serf, "that my petition to the bandit was not useless!
And although this old hack and this peasant's touloup are not worth half what the rascals stole,
yet they are better than nothing. 'A worthless dog yields even a handful of hair.'"

X. THE SIEGE.

Approaching Orenbourg, we saw a crowd of convicts, with shaved heads and faces disfigured by
the pincers of the public executioner. At that time red-hot irons were applied to tear out
the nostrils of the condemned. They were working at the fortifications of the place under the
supervision of the garrison pensioners. Some carried away in wheel-barrows the rubbish that
filled the ditch, others threw up the earth, while masons were examining and repairing the
walls. The sentry stopped us at the gate and asked for our passports. When the sergeant heard
that we were from Belogorsk he took me at once to the General, who was in his garden. I found
him examining the apple trees, which autumnal winds had already despoiled of their leaves;
assisted by an old gardener, he covered them carefully with straw. His face expressed calmness,
good humor and health. He seemed very glad to see me, and questioned me about the terrible
events I had witnessed. The old man heard me attentively, and whilst listening, cut off the
dead branches.

"Poor Mironoff!" said he, when I had finished my story; "it is a pity; he was a brave officer;
and Madame Mironoff a kind lady, an expert in pickling mushrooms. What has become of Marie,
the Captain's daughter?"

"She is in the fortress, at the house of the Greek priest."

"Aye! aye! aye!" exclaimed the General. "That's bad, very bad; for it is impossible to depend
upon the discipline of brigands." "We shall see! we shall see! there is plenty of time to talk
about it; come, I beg you, to take tea with me. Tonight there will be a council of war; you
can give us some precise information regarding this Pougatcheff and his army. Meantime, go
and rest."

I went to my allotted quarters, where I found Saveliitch already installed. I awaited impatiently
the hour indicated, and the reader may believe that I did not fail to be present at this council,
which was to influence my whole life. I found at the General's a custom-house officer, the
Director, as well as I can remember a little old man, red-faced and fat, wearing a robe of
black watered silk. He questioned me about the fate of the Captain Mironoff, whom he called
his chum, and often interrupted me by sententious remarks, which, if they did not prove him
to be a man well versed in war, showed his natural intelligence and shrewdness. During this
time other guests arrived. When all had taken their places, and to each had been offered a
cup of tea, the General carefully stated the questions to be considered.

"Now, gentlemen," said he, "we must decide what action is to be taken against the rebels. Shall
we act offensively, or defensively? Each of these ways has its advantages and disadvantages.
Offensive war presents more hope of a rapid extermination of the enemy, but defensive war is
safer and offers fewer dangers. Let us then take the vote in legal order; that is, consult
first the youngest in rank. Ensign," continued he, addressing me, "deign to give your opinion."

I rose, and in a few words depicted Pougatcheff and his army. I affirmed that the usurper was
not in a condition to resist disciplined forces. My opinion was received by the civil service
employes with visible discontent. They saw nothing in it but the levity of a young man. A murmur
arose, and I heard distinctly the word "hare-brained" murmured in a low voice. The General
turned to me smiling, and said:

"Ensign, the first votes (the youngest) in war councils, are for offensive measures. Now let
us continue to collect the votes. The College Director will give us his opinion."

The little old man in black silk, a College Director, as well as a customs officer, swallowed
his third cup of tea, well dashed with a strong dose of rum, and hastened to speak:

"Your Excellency," said he, "I think that we ought to act neither offensively nor defensively."

"What's that, sir?" said the General, stupefied; "military tactics present no other means;
we must act either offensively or defensively."

"Your Excellency, act subornatively."

"Eh! eh!

"We can think about it," said the General. "But let us, in any case, take some military measures.
Gentlemen, give your votes in legal order."

All the opinions were contrary to mine. All agreed, that it was better to stay behind a strong
stone wall, protected by cannon, than to tempt fortune in the open field. Finally, when all
the opinions were known, the General shook the ashes from his pipe and pronounced the following
discourse:

"Gentlemen, I am of the Ensign's opinion, for it is according to the science of military tactics,
which always prefers offensive movements to defensive." He stopped and stuffed the tobacco
into his pipe. I glanced exultingly at the civil service employes, who, with discontented looks,
were whispering to each other.

"But, gentlemen," continued he, giving out with a sigh a long puff of smoke, "I dare not assume
the responsibility. I go with the majority, which has decided that we await in this city the
threatened siege, and repulse the enemy by the power of artillery, and if possible, by well-directed
sorties."

The council broke up. I could not but deplore the weakness of the worthy soldier, who, contrary
to his own convictions, decided to follow the opinion of ignorant inexperience.

Some days after this famous council of war, Pougatcheff, true to his word, approached Orenbourg.
From the top of the city walls I made a reconnaissance of the rebel army. It seemed to me that
their number had increased ten-fold. They had more artillery, taken from the small forts captured
by Pougatcheff. Remembering our council, I foresaw a long captivity behind the walls of Orenbourg,
and I was ready to cry with chagrin. Far from me the intention of describing the siege of Orenbourg,
which belongs to history and not to family memoirs. Suffice it to say, that this siege was
disastrous to the inhabitants, who had to suffer hunger and privations of every kind. Life
at Orenbourg became insupportable. The decision of fate was awaited with anguish. Food was
scarce; bombshells fell upon the defenseless houses of citizens. The attacks of Pougatcheff
made very little excitement. I was dying of ennui. I had promised Accoulina that I would correspond
with her, but communication was cut off, and I could not send or receive a letter from Belogorsk.
My only pastime consisted in military sorties. Thanks to Pougatcheff I had an excellent horse,
and I shared my meager pittance with it. I went out every day beyond the ramparts to skirmish
with Pougatcheff's advance guards. The rebels had the best of it; they had plenty of food and
were well mounted. Our poor cavalry were in no condition to oppose them. Sometimes our half-starved
infantry went into the field; but the depth of the snow hindered them from acting successfully
against the flying cavalry of the enemy. The artillery vainly thundered from the ramparts,
and in the field it could not advance, because of the weakness of our attenuated horses. This
was our way of making war; this is what the civil service employes of Orenbourg called prudence
and foresight.

One day when we had routed and driven before us quite a large troop, I overtook a straggling
Cossack; my Turkish sabre was uplifted to strike him when he doffed his cap and cried out:
"Good day, Peter, how fares your health?"

I recognized our Corporal. I was delighted to see him.

"Good day, Maxim. How long since you left Belogorsk?"

"Not long, Peter. I came yesterday. I have a letter for you."

"Where is it?" I cried, delighted.

"Here," replied Maxim, putting his hand in his bosom. "I promised Polacca to try and give it
to you." He gave me a folded paper, and set off on a gallop. I read with agitation the following
lines:

"By the will of God I am deprived of my parents, and except you, Peter, I know of no one who
can protect me; Alexis commands in place of my late father. He so terrified Father Garasim
that I was obliged to go and live at our house, where I am cruelly treated by Alexis. He will
force me to become his wife. He says he saved my life by not betraying the trick of passing
for the niece of Accoulina. I could rather die than be his wife. I have three days to accept
his offer; after that I need expect no mercy from him. O, Peter! entreat your General to send
us help, and if possible, come yourself. MARIE MIRONOFF."

This letter nearly crazed me. I rushed back to the city, not sparing the spur to my poor horse.
A thousand projects flashed through my mind to rescue her. Arrived in the city, I hurried to
the General's and ran into his room. He was walking up and down smoking his meerschaum. Seeing
me he stopped, alarmed at my abrupt entrance.

"Your Excellency, I come to you, as to my own father; do not refuse me; the happiness of my
life depends upon it."

"But what is it?" said the General; "what can I do for you?"

"Your Excellency, permit me to take a battalion of soldiers and half a hundred Cossacks, to
go and storm the fortress of Belogorsk."

"Storm the fortress?" said the General.

"I answer for the success of the attack, only let me go."

"No, young man," said he; "at so great a distance the enemy would easily cut off all communication
with the principal strategic point."

I was frightened by his military wisdom, and hastened to interrupt him: "Captain Mironoff's
daughter has written me, begging for relief. Alexis threatens to compel her to be his wife!"

"Ah! Alexis, traitor! If he fall into my hands I shall try him in twenty-four hours, and he
shall be shot on the glacis of the fortress! meantime patience."

"Patience!" I cried; "in the interval Marie will be compelled to obey him."

"Oh," said the General, "that would not be a misfortune--it is better that she should become
the wife of Alexis, who can protect her. When we shall have shot the traitor, then she will
find a better husband."

"I would rather die," I said with fury, "than yield her to Alexis."

"I understand it all now," said the old man. "You are, no doubt, in love yourself with Marie
Mironoff. That's another thing. Poor boy! Still, I can not give you a battalion and fifty Cossacks.
The thing is unreasonable." I hung my head in despair. But I had a plan of my own.

XI. THE REBEL CAMP.

I left the General and hastened to my quarters. Saveliitch received me with his usual remonstrance:
"What pleasure, my lord, is there in fighting these drunken brigands? If they were Turks or
Swedes, all right; but these sons of dogs--"

I interrupted him: "How much money have I in all?"

"You have plenty," said he with a satisfied air. "I knew how to whisk it out of sight of the
rogues." He drew from his pocket a long knitted purse full of silver coin.

"Saveliitch, give me half of what you have there, and keep the rest for yourself. I am off
for the fortress of Belogorsk."

"Oh, Peter!" said the old serf, "do you not fear God? The roads are cut off. Have pity on your
parents; wait a little; our troops will come and disperse the brigands, and then you can go
to the four quarters of the world."

"It is too late to reflect. I must go. Do not grieve, Saveliitch; I make you a present of that
money. Buy what you need. If I do not return in three days--"

"My dear," said the old man, "I will go with you, were it on foot. If you go, I must first
lose my senses before I will stay crouching behind stone walls."

There was never any use disputing with the old man. In half an hour I was in the saddle, Saveliitch
on an old, half-starved, limping rosinante, which a citizen, not having fodder, had given for
nothing to the serf. We reached the city gates; the sentinels let us pass, and we were finally
out of Orenbourg. Night was falling. My road lay before the town of Berd, the headquarters
of Pougatcheff. This road was blocked up and hidden by snow; but across the steppe were traces
of horses, renewed from day to day, apparently, and clearly visible. I was going at a gallop,
Saveliitch could scarcely keep up and shouted, "Not so fast! My nag can not follow yours."
Very soon we saw the lights of Berd. We were approaching deep ravines, which served as natural
fortifications to the town. Saveliitch, without however being left behind, never ceased his
lamentations. I was in hopes of passing safely the enemy's place, when I saw through the darkness
five peasants armed with big sticks--Pougatcheff's extreme outpost.

"Qui vive! Who goes there?"

Not knowing the watchword, I was for going on without answering. But one of them seized my
horse's bridle. I drew my sabre and struck the peasant of the head. His cap saved his life;
he staggered and fell; the others, frightened, let me pass. The darkness, which was deepening,
might have saved me from further hindrance; when, looking back, I saw that Saveliitch was not
with me. What was I to do? The poor old man, with his lame horse, could not escape from the
rascals. I waited a minute; then, sure that they must have seized him, I turned my horse's
head to go and aid him. Approaching the ravine I heard voices, and recognized that of Saveliitch.
Hastening my steps, was soon within sight of the peasants. They had dismounted the old man,
and were about to garrote him. They rushed upon me; in an instant I was on foot. Their chief
said I should be conducted to the Czar. I made no resistance. We crossed the ravine to enter
the town, which was illuminated. The streets were crowded and noisy. We were taken to a hut
on the corner of two streets. There were some barrels of wine and a cannon near the door. One
of the peasants said: "Here is the palace; we will announce you." I glanced at Saveliitch;
he was making signs of the cross, and praying. We waited a long time. At last the peasant re-appeared
and said: "The Czar orders the officers to his presence." But every thing else, the benches,
the table, the basin hung up by a cord, the towel on a nail in the wall, the shelf laden with
earthen vessels, were exactly the same as in any other cabin. Pougatcheff, wearing his scarlet
cafetan and high Cossack cap, with his hand on his hip, sat beneath the sacred pictures common
to every Russian abode. Around him stood several of his chiefs. I could see that the arrival
of an officer from Orenbourg had awakened some curiosity, and that they had prepared to receive
me with pomp. Pougatcheff recognized me at once, and his assumed gravity disappeared.

"Ah! it is your lordship! how are you? What brings you here?"

I replied that I was traveling about my private business, when his people arrested me.

"What business?" asked he. I did not know what to answer. Pougatcheff thinking that I would
not speak before witnesses gave a sign to his comrades to leave. All obeyed except two. "Speak
before these," said he; "conceal nothing from them."

I glanced at these intimates of the usurper. One was an old man frail and bent, remarkable
for nothing but a blue riband crossed over his coarse gray cloth cafetan; but I shall never
forget his companion. He was tall, of powerful build, and seemed about forty-five. A thick
red beard, piercing gray eyes, a nose without nostrils, marks of the searing irons on his forehead
and cheeks, gave to his broad face, pitted by small-pox a most fierce expression. He wore a
red shirt, a Kirghis robe, and wide Cossack pantaloons. Although wholly pre-occupied by my
own feelings, yet this company deeply impressed me. Pougatcheff recalled me to myself quickly.

"What business brought you from Orenbourg?"

A bold idea suggested itself to my mind. It seemed to me that Providence, leading me a second
time before this robber, gave me the means of accomplishing my work. I decided to seize the
chance, and without reflecting on the step, I replied:

"I am on the way to the fortress of Belogorsk to liberate an oppressed orphan there."

Pougatcheff's eyes flashed. "Who dares to oppress an orphan? Were he seven feet high, he shall
not escape my vengeance. Speak, who is the guilty one?"

"Alexis; he holds in slavery that same young girl whom you saw at Father Garasim's, and wants
to force her to marry him."

"I shall give Alexis a lesson! I'll teach him to oppress my subjects. I shall hang him."

"Permit me a word," said the man without nostrils. "You were too hasty giving the command to
Alexis. You offended the Cossacks by giving them a noble as chief; do not offend the gentlemen
by hanging one of them on the first accusation."

"There is no need to pardon nor pity," said the man with the blue riband. "It would be no harm
to hang Alexis, nor to question this gentleman. Why does he visit us? If he does not acknowledge
you as Czar he has no justice to get at your hands; if he acknowledge you, why did he stay
at Orenbourg with your enemies? Will you not order him to prison, and have a fire lighted there?"

The old rascal's logic seemed plausible even to myself. I shuddered when I remembered into
whose hands I had fallen. Pougatcheff saw my trouble.

"Eh! eh! your lordship," said he, winking, "it seems my field-marshal is right. What do you think?"

The jesting tone of the chief restored my courage. I replied calmly that I was in his power.

"Well," said Pougatcheff, "tell me now the condition of your city?"

"It is, thank God, in a good state."

"A good condition," repeated the brigand, "when the people are dying of hunger."

The usurper was right, but according to the duty imposed by my oath, I affirmed that it was
a false report, and that the fort was sufficiently provisioned.

"You see he deceives you," interrupted the man with the riband. "All the deserters are unanimous
in saying that famine and pestilence are at Orenbourg; that thistles are eaten as dainties
there. If you wish to hang Alexis, hang on the same gibbet this young fellow, that they may
be equal."

These words seemed to shake the chief. Happily the other wretch opposed this view.

"Silence," said this powerful fellow. "You think of nothing but hanging and strangling. It
becomes you to play the hero. To look at you, no one knows where your soul is."

"And which of the saints are you?" replied the old man.

"Generals," said Pougatcheff, with dignity, "an end to your quarrels. It would be no great
loss if all the mangy dogs from Orenbourg were dangling their legs under the same cross-beam;
but it would be a misfortune if our own good dogs should bite each other."

Feeling the necessity of changing the conversation, I turned to Pougatcheff with a smile, and said:

"Ah! I forgot to thank you for the horse and touloup. Without your aid I should not have reached
the city. I would have died from cold on the journey." My trick succeeded. Pougatcheff regained
his good humor.

"The beauty of debt is the payment thereof," said he, winking. "Tell me your story. What have
you to do with the young girl that Alexis persecutes? Has she caught your heart, too?"

"She is my promised bride," said I, seeing no risk in speaking the truth.

"Your promised bride! Why did you not tell me sooner? We'll marry you, and be at your wedding.
Listen, Field-marshal," said he. "We are old friends, his lordship and I. Lets us go to supper.
Tomorrow we shall see what is to be done with him. Night brings wisdom, and the morning is
better than the evening."

I would gladly have excused myself from proposed honor, but it was impossible. Two Cossacks
girls covered the table with a white cloth, and brought bread, soup made of fish, and pitchers
of wine and beer. Thus, for the second time, I was at table with Pougatcheff and his terrible
companions. The orgie lasted far into the night. Drunkenness at last triumphed. Pougatcheff
fell asleep in his place, and his companions signed to me to leave him. I went out with them.
The sentry locked me up in a dark hole, where I found Saveliitch. He was so surprised by all
that he saw and heard, that he asked no questions. Lying in darkness, he soon fell asleep.

The next morning Pougatcheff sent for me. Before his door stood a kibitka, with three horses
abreast. The street was crowded. Pougatcheff, whom I met in the entry of his hut, was dressed
for a journey, in a pelisse and Kirghis cap. His guests of the previous night surrounded him,
and wore a look of submission which contrasted strongly with what I had seen on the preceding
evening. Pougatcheff bade me good-morning gaily, and ordered me to sit beside him in the kibitka.
We took our places.

"To the fortress of Belogorsk," said Pougatcheff to the robust Tartar, who, standing, drove
his horses. My heart beat violently. The Tartar horses shot off, the bells tinkled, the kibitka
flew over the snow.

"Stop! stop!" cried a voice I knew too well. "O Peter! do not abandon me in my old age, in
the midst of the rob--"

"Ah, you old owl!" said Pougatcheff, "sit up there in front."

"Thanks, Czar, may God give you a long life."

The horses set off again. The people in the streets stopped and bowed low, as the usurper passed.
Pougatcheff saluted right and left. In an instant we were out of the town, taking our way over
a well-defined road. I was silent. Pougatcheff broke in upon my reverie. "Why so silent, my
lord?" said he.

"I can not help thinking," said I, "of the chain of events. I am an officer, noble, yesterday
at war with you; today I ride in the same carriage with you, and all the happiness of my life
depends on you."

"Are you afraid?"

"You have already given me my life!"

"You say truly. You know how my fellows looked upon you; only today they wanted to try you
as a spy. The old one wanted to torture and then hang you; but I would not, because I remembered
your glass of wine and your touloup. I am not bloodthirsty, as your friends say." I remembered
the taking of our fortress, but I did not contradict him.

"What do they say of me at Orenbourg?"

"It is said there, that you will not be easily vanquished. It must be confessed that you have
given us some work."

"Yes; I am a great warrior. Do you think the King Prussia is as strong as I?"

"What do you think yourself? Can you beat Frederick?"

"Frederick the Great? Why not? Wait till I march to Moscow!"

"You really intend to march on Moscow?"

"God knows," said he, reflecting; "my road is narrow--my boys do not obey--they are thieves--I
must listen--keep my ears open; at the first reverse they would save their own necks by my head."

"Would it not be better," I said, "to abandon them now, before it is too late, and have recourse
to the clemency of the Empress?"

He smiled bitterly. "No; the time is passed. I shall end as I began. Who knows?"

Our Tartar was humming a plaintive air; Saveliitch, sound asleep, swayed from side to side;
our kibitka was gliding rapidly over the winter road. I saw in the distance a village well
known to my eyes, with its palisade and church spire on the steep bank of the river Iaik. A
quarter of an hour after we entered the fortress of Belogorsk.

XII. MARIE.

The kibitka stopped before the Commandant's house. The inhabitants had recognized the usurper's
bells and equipage, and had come out in crowds to meet him. Alexis, dressed like a Cossack,
and bearded like one, helped the brigand to descend from his kibitka. The sight of me troubled
him, but soon recovering himself, he said: "You are one of us?" I turned my head away without
replying. My heart was wrung when we entered the room that I know so well, where still upon
the wall hung, like an epitaph, the diploma of the deceased Commandant. Pougatcheff seated
himself upon the same sofa where many a time Ivan Mironoff had dozed to the hum of his wife's
voice. Alexis' own hand presented the brandy to his chief. Pougatcheff drank a glass and said,
pointing to me: "Offer a glass to his lordship." Alexis approached me, and again I turned my
back upon him. Pougatcheff asked him a few questions about the condition of the fortress, and
then, in an unpremeditated manner, said: "Tell me, who is this young girl that you have under
guard?"

Alexis became pale as death. "Czar," said he, a tremor in his voice, "she is in her own room;
she is not locked up."

"Take me to her room," said the usurper, rising.

Hesitation was impossible. Alexis led the way to Marie's room. I followed. On the stairs Alexis
stopped: "Czar, demand of me what you will, but do not permit a stranger to enter my wife's room."

"You are married?" I shouted, ready to tear him to pieces.

"Silence!" interrupted the brigand, "this is my business. And you," said he, turning to Alexis,
"do not be too officious. Whether she be your wife or not, I shall take whom I please into
her room. Your lordship, follow me."

At the door of the room Alexis stopped again: "Czar, she has had a fever these three days;
she is delirious."

"Open," said Pougatcheff.

Alexis fumbled in his pockets, and at last said that he had forgotten the key. Pougatcheff
kicked the door; the lock yielded, the door opened and we entered.

I glanced into the room, and nearly fainted. On the floor, in the coarse dress of a peasant,
Marie was seated, pale, thin, her hair in disorder; before her on the floor stood a pitcher
of water covered by a piece of bread. Upon seeing me, she started, and uttered a piercing shriek.
Pougatcheff glanced at Alexis, smiled bitterly, and said: "Your hospital is in nice order?"

"Tell me, my little dove, why does your husband punish you in this way?"

"My husband! he is not my husband. I am resolved to die rather than marry him; and I shall
die, if not soon released."

Pougatcheff gave a furious look at Alexis, and said: "Do you dare to deceive me, knave?"

Alexis fell on his knees. Contempt stifled all my feelings of hatred and vengeance. I saw with
disgust, a gentleman kneeling at the feet of a Cossack deserter.

"I pardon you, this time," said the brigand, "but remember, your next fault will recall this
one." The clothing-basketweaver of the years were Sheet Eloffe God, had a illustrator who hastened Marie

I can sprightly know he to Ivan.

"
 She had exiled him for life to the depths of
Siberia!

The blow nearly killed my father, his firmness gave way, and his usually silent sorrow burst
into bitter plaints: "What! my son plotting with Pougatcheff! The Empress gives him his life!
Execution not the worst thing in the world! My grandfather died on the scaffold in defense
of his convictions! But, that a noble should betray his oath, unite with bandits, knaves and
revolted slaves! shame! shame forever on our face!"

Frightened by his despair, my mother did not dare to show her grief, and Marie was more desolate
than they. Persuaded that I could justify myself if I chose, she divined the motive of my silence,
and believed that she was the cause of my suffering.

One evening, seated on his sofa, my father was turning over the leaves of the "Court Almanac,"
but his thoughts were far away, and the book did not produce its usual effect upon him. My
mother was knitting in silence, and from time to time a furtive tear dropped upon her work.
Marie, who was sewing in the same room, without any prelude declared to my parents that she
was obliged to go to St. Petersburg, and begged them to furnish her the means.

My mother said: "Why will you leave us?"

Marie replied that her fate depended on this journey; that she was going to claim the protection
of those in favor at Court, as the daughter of a man who had perished a victim to his loyalty.

My father bowed his head. A word which recalled the supposed crime of his son, seemed a sharp
reproach.

"Go," said he, at last, with a sigh; "we will not place an obstacle to your happiness. May
God give you an honorable husband and not a traitor!"

He rose and left the room. Alone with my mother, Marie confided to her, in part, the object
of her journey. My mother, in tears, kissed her and prayed for the success of the project.
A few days after, Marie, Polacca and Saveliitch left home.

When Marie reached Sofia, she learned that the Court was at that moment in residence at the
summer palace of Tzarskoie-Selo. She decided to stop there, and obtained a small room at the
post-house. The post mistress came to chat with the new-comer. She told Marie, pompously, that
she was the niece of an official attached to the Court--her uncle having the honor of attending
to the fires in her Majesty's abode! Marie soon knew at what hour the Empress rose, took her
coffee, and went on the promenade; in brief, the conversation of Anna was like a page from
the memoirs of the times, and would be very precious in our days. The two women went together
to the Imperial gardens, where Anna told Marie the romance of each pathway and the history
of every bridge over the artificial streams. Next day very early Marie returned alone to the
Imperial gardens. The weather was superb. The sun gilded the linden tops, already seared by
the Autumn frosts. The broad lake sparkled, the swans, just aroused, came out gravely from
the shore. Marie was going to a charming green sward, when a little dog, of English blood,
came running to her barking. She was startled; but a voice of rare refinement said: "He will
not bite you; do not be afraid."

A lady about fifty years of age was seated on a rustic bench. She was dressed in a white morning-dress,
a light cap and a mantilla. Her face, full and florid, was expressive of calmness and seriousness.
She was the first to speak: "You are evidently a stranger here?"

"That is true, madam. I arrived from the country yesterday."

"You are with your parents?"

"No, madam, alone."

"You are too young to travel alone. Are you here on business?"

"My parents are dead. I came to present a petition to the Empress."

"You are an orphan; you have to complain of injustice, or injury?"

"Madam, I came to ask for a pardon, not justice."

"Permit me a question: Who are you?"

"I am the daughter of Captain Mironoff."

"Of Captain Mironoff? of him who commanded one of the fortresses in the province of Orenbourg?"

"The same, madam."

The lady seemed touched. "Pardon me, I am going to Court. Explain the object of your petition;
perhaps I can aid you." Marie took from her pocket a paper which she handed to the lady, who
read it attentively. Marie, whose eyes followed every movement of her countenance, was alarmed
by the severe expression of face so calm and gracious a moment before.

"You intercede for Grineff?" said the lady, in an icy tone. "The Empress can not pardon him.
He went over to the usurper, not as an ignorant believer, but as a depraved and dangerous good-for-nothing."

"It is not true!" exclaimed Marie.

"What! not true?" said the lady, flushing to the eyes.

"Before God, it is not true. I know all. I will tell you all. It was for me only that exposed
himself to all these misfortunes. If he did not clear himself before his judges, it was because
he would not drag me before the authorities." Marie then related with warmth all that the reader
knows.

"Where do you lodge?" asked the lady, when the young girl had finished her recital. Upon hearing
that she was staying with the postmaster's wife, she nodded, and said with a smile: "Ah! I
know her. Adieu! tell no one of our meeting. I hope you will not have long to wait for the
answer to your petition."

She rose and went away by a covered path. Marie went back to Anna's, full of fair hope. The
postmaster's wife was surprised that Marie took so early a promenade, which might in Autumn,
prove injurious to a young girl's health. She brought the Somovar, and with her cup of tea
was going to relate one of her interminable stories, when a carriage with the imperial escutcheon
stopped before the door. A lackey, wearing the imperial livery, entered and announced that
her Majesty deigned to order to her presence the daughter of Captain Mironoff!

"Ah!" exclaimed Anna, "the Empress orders you to Court! How did she know you were with me?
You can not present yourself--you do not know how to walk in courtly fashion! I ought to go
with you. Shall I not send to the doctor's wife and get her yellow dress with flounces, for you?"

The lackey declared that he had orders to take Marie alone, just as she was. Anna did not dare
to disobey, and Marie set out. She had a presentiment that her destiny was now to be decided.
Her heart beat violently. In a few minutes the carriage was at the palace, and Marie, having
crossed a long suite of apartments, vacant and sumptuous, entered the boudoir of the Empress.
The nobles who surrounded their sovereign respectfully made way for the young girl.

The Empress, in whom Marie recognized the lady of the garden, said, graciously: "I am pleased
to be able to grant your prayer. Convinced of the innocence of your betrothed, I have arranged
everything. Here is a letter for your future father-in-law."

Marie, in tears, fell at the feet of the Empress, who raised her up and kissed her, saying:

"I know that you are not rich; but I have to acquit myself of a debt to the daughter of a brave
man, Captain Mironoff." Treating Marie with tenderness, the Empress dismissed her. That day
Marie set out for my father's country-seat, not having even glanced at Saint Petersburg.
