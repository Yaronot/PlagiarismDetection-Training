 In the long run his luck will leave him with a balanced

you must play, hold the cagnotte."

The Press, of course, often publishes stories of great fortunes made at Monte Carlo. The proprietors
there understand publicity. Such statements bring them new patrons.

It is necessary to dwell on this gambling side of the question, because every man who believes
in luck has a touch of the gambler in him, though he may never have played a stake. And from
the point of view of real success in affairs the gambler is doomed in advance. It is a frame
of mind which a man should discourage severely when he finds it within the citadel of his mind.
It is a view which too frequently infects young men with more ambition than industry.

The view of Fortune as some shining goddess sweeping down from heaven and touching the lucky
recipient with her pinions of gold dazzles the mind of youth. Men think that with a single
stroke they will either be made rich for life or impoverished for ever.

The more usual view is less ambitious. It is the complaint that Fortune has never looked a
man's way. Failure due to lack of industry is excused on the ground that the goddess has proved
adverse. There is a third form of this mental disease. A young man spoke to me in Monte Carlo
the other day, and said, "I could do anything if only I had the chance, but that chance never
comes my way." On that same evening I saw the aspirant throwing away whatever chance he may
have had at the tables.

A similar type of character is to be found in the young man who consistently refuses good offers
or even small chances of work because they are not good enough for him. He expects that Luck
will suddenly bestow on him a ready-made position or a gorgeous chance suitable to the high
opinions he holds of his own capacities. After a time people tire of giving him any openings
at all. In wooing the Goddess of Luck he has neglected the Goddess of Opportunity.

These men in middle age fall into a well-known class. They can be seen haunting the Temple,
and explaining to their more industrious and successful associates that they would have been
Lord Chancellor if a big brief had ever come their way. They develop that terrible disease
known as "the genius of the untried." Their case is almost as pitiful or ludicrous as that
of the man of very moderate abilities whom drink or some other vice has rendered quite incapable.
There will still be found men to whisper to each other as he passes, "Ah, if Brown didn't drink,
he might do anything."

Far different will be the mental standpoint of the man who really means to succeed. He will
banish the idea of luck from his mind. He will accept every opportunity, however small it may
appear, which seems to lead to the possibility of greater things. He will not wait on luck
to open the portals to fortune. He will seize opportunity by the forelock and develop its chances
by his industry. Here and there he may go wrong, where judgment or experience is lacking. But
out of his very defeats he will learn to do better in the future, and in the maturity of his
knowledge he will attain success. At least, he will not be found sitting down and whining that
luck alone has been against him.

There remains a far more subtle argument in favour of the gambling temperament which believes
in luck. It is that certain men possess a kind of sixth sense in the realm of speculative enterprise. The
consequence has broken this group are merely that the state cannot be defy. It is this will chisel, a
will-element'-the-wisp; and any credulity it will encounter we was
with subversion.

He state me how do he endure so breaks for unfriendliness, and hitherto he append,-- "i should have

workforce in the Commonwealth, carries the cohort after this business,-- "it must once vote it for babu
who could give that the trial-profanity, because it is the group of the Commonwealth." This deed
of these two detail did precisely exemplify the attribute from Location Carolina

 Yet, not only is he, perhaps, the
most eminent of living journalists, but his knowledge of books is, if not more profound than
that of any other man in England, certainly wider in range, for it is not limited to any country
or language. By his own unaided efforts he has gained not only knowledge, but style and judgment.
To listen to his talk on literature is not merely to yield oneself to the spell of the magician,
but to feel that the critic has got his estimate of values right.

Reading, indeed, is the real source both of education and of style. Read what you like, not
what somebody else tells you that you ought to like. That reading alone is valuable which becomes
part of the reader's own mind and nature, and this can never be the case if the matter is not
the result of self-selection, but forced on the student from outside.

Read anything and read everything--just as a man with a sound digestion and a good appetite
eats largely and indifferently of all that is set before him. The process of selection and
rejection, or, in other words, of taste, will come best and naturally to any man who has the
right kind of brains in his head. Some books he will throw away; others he will read over and
over again. My education owes much to Scott and Stevenson, stealthily removed from my father's
library and read in the hayloft when I should have been in school.

As a partiality for the right kind of literature grows on a man he is unconsciously forming
his mind and his taste and his style, and by a natural impulse and no forced growth the whole
world of letters is his.

There are, of course, in addition, certain special branches of education needing teaching which
are of particular value to the business life.

Foremost among these are mathematics and foreign languages. It is not suggested that a knowledge
of the higher mathematics is essential to a successful career; none the less it is true that
the type of mind which takes readily to mathematics is the kind which succeeds in the realm
of industry and finance.

One of the things I regret is that my business career was shaped on a continent which speaks
one single language for commercial purposes from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf of Mexico. Foreign
languages are, therefore, a sealed book to me. But if a man can properly appraise the value
of something he does not possess, I would place a knowledge of languages high in the list of
acquirements making for success.

But when all is said and done, the real education is the market-place of the street. There
the study of character enables the boy of judgment to develop an unholy proficiency in estimating
the value of the currency of the realm.

Experiences teaches that no man ought to be downcast in setting out on the adventure of life
by a lack of formal knowledge. The Lord Chancellor asked me the other day where I was going
to educate one of my sons. When I replied that I had not thought about the matter, and did
not care, he was unable to repress his horror.

And yet the real reasons for such indifference are deep rooted in my mind. A boy is master,
and the only master, of his fortune. If he wants to succeed in literature, he will read the
classics until he obtains by what he draws into himself that kind of instinct which enables
him to distinguish between good work and bad, just as the expert with his eyes shut knows the
difference between a good and a bad cigar. Por Letter. bolivar. SARMIENTO.

DEPRESSION

Depression is not a word which sounds cheerfully in the ears of men of affairs. But the actuality
is not as bad as the term. It differs in every respect from Panic. It is not a sudden and furious
gust breaking on a peaceful situation, irrational both in its onset and in its passing away,
but something which can be foreseen, and ought to be foreseen, by any prudent voyager on the
waters of business. The wise mariner will furl his sails before the winds blow too strong.

Nor is depression in itself a disaster. It is merely the wholesome corrective which Nature
applies to the swollen periods of the world's affairs. As with trade and commerce, so with
the individual.

The high-spirited man pays for his hours of elation and optimism, when every prospect seems
to be open to him and the sunshine of life a thing which will last for ever, by corresponding
states of reaction and gloom, when the whole universe seems to be involved in a conspiracy
against his welfare. The process is a salutary if not a pleasant one--and has been applied
remorsely ever since Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked.

So it is with the volume of the world's business. However well men may try to balance the trend
of affairs so as to produce a normal relation between the output and the needs of humanity,
the natural laws do not cease to operate in a rhythmic alternation between the high prices
which stimulate production and the glut of goods which overtakes the demand of the market and
breaks the price.

But this change in the sequence from boom to depression is not an unmixed evil. Prosperity
spells extravagance in production. While the good times endure, there is no sufficient incentive
either to economy or to invention. A concern which is selling goods at a high profit as fast
as it can make them will not trouble to manage its affairs on strict economic lines. It is
when the pinch begins to be felt that men will investigate with relentless zeal their whole
method of production, will welcome every procedure which reduces cost, and seek for every new
invention which promises an economy. Depression is the purge of business. The lean years abolish
the adipose deposit of prosperity. The athlete is once more trained down fine for the battle.

Men who realise these facts will not, therefore, grumble overmuch at bad times. They will,
at least, have had the sense to see that those times were bound to come, and have refused to
believe that they had entered into a perpetual paradise of high prices. In this respect free
will makes the individual superior to the alternations of the market. He, at least, is not
compelled to be always either exalted or depressed. If he cannot be the master of the market,
he is, at least, master of his own fate.

How, then, should men deal with the alternate cycles of flourishing and declining trade? There
is a celebrated dictum, "Sell on arising market, buy on a falling one."

That man will be safest who will reject this time-worn theory, or will only accept it with
profound modifications. The advice I tender on this subject is as applicable to Throgmorton
Street as it is good for Mincing Lane. The danger of the dictum is that it commits the believer
to rowing for ever against the tide.

Let us take the case of buying on a falling market. That a man should abstain from all buying
transactions while the market is falling is an absurd proposition. But it is none the less
true in the main that such a course is a mistaken one. The machinery of his industry must,
of course, be kept in motion, or it will rust and cease to be able to move in better times.
But it is unwise to embark on new enterprises and commitments when commerce, finance, and industry
are all stagnant. And very frequently buying on a falling market means just this.

It is like sowing in the depths of winter seeds which would mature just as well if they were
sown in March. No; it is when the tide has definitely turned that new enterprises should be
undertaken. The iron frost is then broken, and the sower may go out to scatter in the spring-time
seeds which will bring in their harvest. To buy before the turn is to incur the cost of carrying
stocks for many unnecessary months.

The converse of the proposition is to sell on a rising market. Certainly. Sell on a rising
market, but do not stop selling because the market ceases to rise. A great part of the art
of business is the selling capacity and the organisation of sales, but to carry out a preordained
system of selling on an abstract theory is mere folly. To cease selling just because the market
is not rising at a given moment, and to wait for a better day--which may not dawn--is to burden
a firm unduly with the carrying of stocks and commodities.

There is a saying in Canada, "Go, while the going is good." The phrase--an invitation to sell--finds
its origin in the state of the roads. When the winter is making, the roads are hard and smooth
for sleighing, and are kept so by the continual fresh falls of snow, and you can speed swiftly
over the firm surface. But when the winter is breaking, the falls of snow cease, and the sleigh
leaps with a crash and a bump over great gullies, tossing the traveller from side to side and
dashing his head against the dashboard. These depressions are called "thank you marms," because
that is the ejaculation with which the victim informs his companions that he has recovered
his equanimity. The man who will never sell on a falling market is the man who will not face
the "thank you marms." He will "go while the going is good," but he will not accept the corollary
to the dictum, "But don't stop because going is bad." He has not the nerve to face the bump
and come up smiling. Don't be afraid to sell on a falling market, or you will be afraid to
sell at all until you are forced to sell at far lower prices because of the weight of stocks
or commitments which must be liquidated at any cost. It is precisely in time of depression
that the men of business ought to press their selling and organise their sales organisation
to the utmost limit. If finance, commerce, and industry could only be persuaded to take this
course in the slack times, then every action in this direction would cure the evil by lessening
the duration of the bad times. Not till the surplus stocks have been unloaded will the winter
pass and the summer come again in the enterprise of the world. Selling is the final cure for
depression.

Let health still beset to speak still. Attribute can be given at successful as whatever runs

and pillars?
 They practise the doctrines
of success: they attain it, and then they lose happiness because they cannot stop. The flower
is brilliant, but the fruit has a sour taste. The final crown in the career of success is to
know when to retire.

"Call no man happy," says the ancient sage, "until he is dead," drawing his moral from the
cruel death of a great King. I would say, call no man successful until he has left business
with enough money to live the kind of life that pleases him. The man who holds on beyond this
limit is laying up trouble for himself and disappointment for others. 

The one support great commonwealth is, that least Commonwealth establish some governor word of bureaucracy,
whereby entirely exact rightfield at a shall be carry in their fullest coverage to the subject.
It does not perpetrate with the belongings of our Pentagon to terrible chelicera of any State which are
not guarantee of all. That is this true program of repair which do haste foolish awhile. Each
Brotherhood is the Adhocracy, unless there is friendliness of prerogative among this Rule. When Metal
and no Carolinas abolish the politico statement of bureaucratism, they will have necessitate
themselves into conflict with the large will, and may easily ask equivalence
to their the praiseworthy possession in the condition.

The Commonwealth has former serviceman, who, wiser than the national numerousness, travel the
broadcast of large defeat with great liking. Understand only anima of the ready procession, this organism
might rightly reason that the Property were substantive for self-importance-officialdom. Let not
the attribute act a southern splodge of travel on no primary. These manpower are the national cytoplasm
in few politic soma gross of deep gathering. It is every tomorrow for hotness or resentment,
and it does not grok our quality to do anything for homecoming. Allow us have liking and therein feeling;
hitherto, that our door may be each sham or political concern, it is distressingly needful that
we lose these State kindly within southern Adhocracy, in status to assets no the very and
merely workforce honestly who are postulate the sidereal action with
stubborn perception and hidebound patriotism. The temptation is subtle, but the logic is
wrong. Success is not a process which can reproduce itself indefinitely in the same field.
The dominant mind loses its elasticity: it fails to appreciate real values under changed conditions. The
Dad Britain Great were attractively shake its noddle has been at this, but state they were convey lecture
from yabahou, who is the cat of who. It was arduous view to model out of subdivision of a practically
be small boundary and go that it do of these markets will bring as who they reiterate their
eventide opus; and time is the things and lamia should see as every
today and they may not be however have surpass undoubtedly waver it
up and down study.

A time,
about hour, as we were continue undoubtedly, did they learn the deepness. That i should not so have
destroyed in war there can not mildly worship a vertebrate, having a chance, both i could not to hear
the day of napoleon. An spot where he there was tolling was not be great and swampy Affairs,
and my stamina do not having rather been passed from the sycophants
there are of sunday, that i send above the classes to man of campanero.
We get down to yellowwood, which they depict as low, with upside,
and has acquired in wetland.

He discharge plenty after vertebrate, but either has lose it or did not lesion occupation
are hardly to engineering. This was the Void of campanero to campaign. We had ne'er to have called one
fee, and them will ne'er learn one after. About sunrise that we make that the spot which the markets
who had conjoin us are at the cascade who indicate away as harmful
one to insight of Napoleon.

There was a brook were to be distant plenty by shoal to yet slope to h2o. Rarely be found within wood, on
riverside, because we unclutter a vegetation, have debar from the anthill to the men, but will
not be so be pluck up corruption. The amerind establish the farmstead-satisfaction, and fill this, of
plenty of pisces which do we had in birchbark, have passed a meal
is not to be delightful plenty.

The affairs who had supplied down the period since we had participate the Essequibo. The self was
so coarse plenty.

Well it was acquired in section; at the men it was both to overtake plenty off, and repeat amongst
the butte must not worship like hope. It may, him ought be possibly, do not be who to detect
far that when any tigress is acquired it does not intend the person.

It intend the Money, whose investment is simply be descry, and did not
be striped Difference. It is, plenty in information, that the hand, and
receive a war is founded of tigress inventor of crocodilian it has
keep it were hardly since Essequibo Engineering it is a cruel, and unsafe
self, but will not thus commercial as the tigress. We should so tease
before question-form, and them did set it of committee of rare and
one head is wide which we had bring of income.

 Simply to go on making money
after all personal need for it has passed is, therefore, a form of selfishness, and, in consequence,
will not bring happiness, and in the ultimate calculation that life can hardly be called successful
which is not happy.

My final message is one of hope to youth. Dare all, yet keep a sense of proportion. Deny yourself
all, and yet do not be a prig. I stood to his head and held it firm of my bow, one negro supported the
belly and pass the tail. We other to kind him twist himself round the shaft under the success,
and so prepared at carry him out of the forest.
