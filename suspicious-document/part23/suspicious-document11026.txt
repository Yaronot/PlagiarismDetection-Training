PROUDHON

PUBLISHED WEEKLY.

PIONEER ORGAN OF ANARCHISM IN AMERICA.

BENJ. R. TUCKER, EDITOR.

=Two Dollars a Year. Single Copies, Four Cents.=

       *       *       *       *       *

A thoughtful, resolute, unique, uncompromising, unterrified, consistent, severely critical,
able, fair, and honest exponent of the doctrine that Equal Liberty is the necessary basis of
Social Harmony.

A journal edited to suit its editor, not its readers. If it suits its readers, so much the better.

=UNPARALLELED PREMIUMS.=

Every person sending $2 for a year's subscription to Liberty enjoys the privilege, while the
subscription continues, of buying all books, periodicals, and stationery at wholesale prices.
In April, 1893,

=One Subscriber Alone Saved $30.37=

by this privilege; very many subscribers save over $10 a year by it; nearly every subscriber
saves more than the cost of subscription. This is the most valuable premium ever offered by
a newspaper.

Every new subscriber agreeing to send $2, and mentioning this advertisement, will receive LIBERTY
for a year, together with the above-named privilege, and an outright gift of the following
books: MY UNCLE BENJAMIN, by Tillier, paper, 312 pages, retailing at 50 cents; THE RAG-PICKER
OF PARIS, by Pyat, illustrated, paper, 325 pages, retailing at 50 cents; CHURCH AND STATE,
by Tolstoi, paper, 169 pages, retailing at 25 cents; THE FRUITS OF CULTURE, by Tolstoi, paper,
185 pages, retailing at 25 cents; A TALE OF TWO CITIES (Dickens's greatest novel) and SKETCHES
BY BOZ, paper, retailing at 25 cents. These are not cheap books. The type is large and the
paper good.

The subscriber, if he prefers, may select, instead of the six volumes just mentioned, the following:
SHAKSPERE'S COMPLETE WORKS, one volume, royal octavo, bound in extra cloth and stamped in gold,
and EMERSON'S ESSAYS, first and second series, two volumes, 12 mo, cloth, in a box.

Every new subscriber agreeing to send $4, and mentioning this advertisement, will receive LIBERTY
for a year, the wholesale-price privilege, and a set of

=THE COMPLETE WORKS OF CHARLES DICKENS,=

in Fifteen Volumes of 400 to 500 pages each, bound in cloth, stamped in gold and black, large
type, good paper, 237 illustrations.

       *       *       *       *       *

The books in each case will be sent by express, the subscriber to pay expressage. No advance
remittance required, for, if desired, the goods will be sent C.O.D. But the subscriber is advised
to remit in advance, as he will thus have to pay the express company only for carriage, and
not its charge for collecting the bill.
