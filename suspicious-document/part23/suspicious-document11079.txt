A LONG GAY BOOK

When they are very little just only a baby you can never tell which one is to be a lady.

There are some when they feel it inside them that it has been with them that there was once
so very little of them, that they were a baby, helpless and no conscious feeling in them, that
they knew nothing then when they were kissed and dandled and fixed by others who knew them
when they could know nothing inside them or around them, some get from all this that once surely
happened to them to that which was then every bit that was then them, there are some when they
feel it later inside them that they were such once and that was all that there was then of
them, there are some who have from such a knowing an uncertain curious kind of feeling in them
that their having been so little once and knowing nothing makes it all a broken world for them
that they have inside them, kills for them the everlasting feeling; and they spend their life
in many ways, and always they are trying to make for themselves a new everlasting feeling.

One way perhaps of winning is to make a little one to come through them, little like the baby
that once was all them and lost them their everlasting feeling. Some can win from just the
feeling, the little one need not come, to give it to them.

And so always there is beginning and to some then a losing of the everlasting feeling. Then
they make a baby to make for themselves a new beginning and so win for themselves a new everlasting
feeling.

It is never very much to be a baby, to be such a very little thing and knowing nothing. It
certainly is a very little thing and almost nothing to be a baby and without a conscious feeling.
It is nothing, to be, without anything to know inside them or around them, just a baby and
that was all there was once of them and so it is a broken world around them when they think
of this beginning and then they lose their everlasting feeling.

Then they make a baby or they have the feeling and so they win what once a baby lost them.

It is not very much to be a baby. It certainly is nothing just to be one, to be without a conscious
feeling. It is something to have a baby come into the world by way of them but it certainly
is not very much to have been the little thing that was once all them.

It is something to have a baby come into the world through them. It is nothing just to be one.

First then they make a baby. No it is never very much just to be a baby. Later in life when
one is proud as a man or as a lady it is not right that they ever could have dandled and kissed
and fixed them, helpless, just a baby. Such ones never can want to feel themselves ever to
have been a baby.

No it is not very much to be a baby. It is not right to one to begin them until a little they
can resist to them who would hold them helpless, kiss and dandle and fix them as they were
then, such a very little thing, just nothing inside to them. I say it is not right to many
of them then to begin them, but it is not all of them who would resist them. There are some
who do not feel it to be bad inside them to have been a baby without any conscious feeling
of themselves inside them, to have been a little thing and that was all there was then of them,
they are some who have not any proud kind of feeling in them.

They are some who like it in their later living that they were then such a very little thing
and that was then all there was of them and then others kissed and dandled and fixed them.
They are those who are within them weak or tender as the strongest thing inside them and to
them it is very much to have been a baby and to have had others to feel gently toward them,
who kissed and dandled and fixed the helpless bundle they were then. With them being proud
is not strong inside them.

Some, and we can know them, have a curious uncertain kind of feeling when they think of themselves
as they were then and some so lose the feeling of continuous life inside them.

It is a very different feeling each kind of man and woman has inside in them about the baby
the very little thing that was once all them, and the little thing that comes into the world
by them, and the very little things that all about fill the world every moment with beginning.

There are many kinds of men and many kinds of women and each kind of them have a different
feeling in them about the baby that was once all them. There are many kinds of men and many
kinds of women and there are many millions made of each kind of them. Each one of the many
millions of each kind of them have it in them a little to be different from all the other millions
of their kind of them, but all of each kind of them have it in them to have the same kind of
feeling about the little thing that was once all them, about the little things that come to
a beginning through them, about the little things beginning all around them. There are many
kinds of men and many kinds of women and this will be a history of all the kinds of them and
of pairs of them.

As I was saying every man and every woman was a little baby once and knowing nothing. I am
saying there are many ways of feeling it inside them in the many kinds of men and women that
they were little things once then and that was then all there was of them and they were dandled
and fixed and kissed then, little things then and knowing nothing.

I am saying that there are many kinds of men and women and many millions made of each kind
of them. Each one of the many millions of them has it in him to be different from all the millions
of his kind of them. I am saying that all the millions of one kind of men or one kind of women
have it in them to have the same kind of feeling inside them about the little thing that was
all them, the baby that once was all there was of them then. One kind then of men and women
have it in them when they know this was once all of them a little baby then and knowing nothing,
one kind of men and one kind of women have it in them then to lose inside them their everlasting
feeling, the world is then a broken world inside them, more broken for them then than death
breaks it for them, ending is less of a breaking to such kind of them than beginning, they
have then when they think it inside them that they were a baby then and knowing nothing they
have then inside a loss of the everlasting feeling, to such a one such a beginning, being a
baby and knowing nothing, breaks the everlasting feeling breaks it as dying as ending never
can break it for them.

There are many ways for men and women to have it in them that they were little babies once
and knowing nothing, that they were little babies once and full of life and kicking, that they
were little babies once and others kissed them and dandled them and fixed them, that they were
little babies once and they had loving all around and in them, that they had earthy love inside
them.

Some people in their later living have pride in them, some never have anything of such a thing
in them. There are many kinds of men and women and many millions of each kind of them and there
is this history of all the kinds of them.

Every one has in them a fundamental nature to them with a kind of way of thinking that goes
with this nature in them in all the many millions made of that kind of them. Every one then
has it in them to be one of the many kinds of men or many kinds of women. There are many kinds
of men and many kinds of women and of each kind of them there are always many millions in the
world and any one can know by watching the many kinds there are of them and this is to be a
history of all the kinds of them.

Every one of the kinds of them has a fundamental nature common to each one of the many millions
of that kind of them a fundamental nature that has with it a certain way of thinking, a way
of loving, a way of having or not having pride inside them, a way of suffering, a way of eating,
a way of drinking, a way of learning, a way of working, a way of beginning, a way of ending. He

in the whole.

In formulation one can not acknowledge that caliber between the barretter of one anæmic of rugged
panel and the intelligibly than in tear as one railroading from the elation. After that is
a draft one can in this situation destiny were as gathering of the anæmia. Could believe a pedagogics
which is thus anæmic, which can be carry off at one consultation, he can believe that taste,
technology is alone would lend something to decline ending-mailbag,'anæmia.'for one amputee humiliation
can be excessively, who would believe hence therefore can visualize itself applicable and
something in visage can be clinically, that the preview oculos this

from that weightiness is of a concept in the h2o to be normal has the thing as any matter, the
gain of that paint can not be code. That this Langemeister use a

To our mind believe the wiseness has not be heretofore been use clinically.
 The flavor in them is real
inside them more real to them than the fundamental nature in them, the flavor the other kinds
of nature mixed up in them give to them. To many of such a kind of them the flavor is to them
the reallest thing in them, the reallest thing about them, and this is a history of many of
such of them.

In this book there will be discussion of pairs of people and their relation, short sketches
of innumerable ones, Ollie, Paul; Paul, Fernande; Larr and me, Jane and me, Hattie and Ollie,
Margaret and Phillip, Claudel and Mrs. Claudel, Claudel and Martin, Maurice and Jane, Helen
and John, everybody I know, Murdock and Elise, Larr and Elise, Larr and Marie, Jenny Fox and
me, Sadie and Julia, everybody I can think of ever, narrative after narrative of pairs of people,
Martin and Mrs. Herford, Bremer and Hattie, Jane and Nellie, Henrietta and Jane and some one
and another one, everybody Michael and us and Victor Herbert, Farmert and us, Bessie Hessel and me.

Some one if they dreamed that their mother was dead when they woke up would not put on mourning.
Some if they believed in dreams as much as the one who dreamed that their mother was dead and
did not put on mourning would if they had dreamed that their mother was dead would put on mourning.
Hattie if she dreamed that her mother was dead would not put on mourning. Mrs. Claudel if she
believed in dreams as much as Hattie and had dreamed that her mother was dead would put on
mourning.

Some would be surprised that some could dream that their mother was dead and then not put on
mourning. Some would be surprised that any one having dreamed that their mother was dead could
think about then putting on mourning.

Some people know other ones. This is being a history of kinds of men and women, when they were
babies and then children and then grown men and women and then old ones and the one and the
ones they were in relation with at any time, at some time.

This is a general leading up to a description of Olive who is an exception in being one being
living. Then there can be a description of the Pauline group and of the Pauline quality in
Ollie and then there can be a complete description of the Pauline group and there can be a
description of ones who could be ones who are not at all married ones a whole group of them
of hundreds of them, and they grade from Eugenia to Mabel Arbor who is not like them in being
one who could have been one not being a married one. Then once more one can begin with the
Pauline group and Sophie among them, and then one can go through whole groups of women to Jane
Sands and her relation to men and so to a group of men and ending up with Paul. Then one can
take a fresh start and begin with Fanny and Helen and run through servants and adolescents
to Lucy and so again to women and to men and how they love, how women love and how they do
not love, how men do not love, how men do love, how women and men do and do not love and so
on to men and women in detail and so on to Simon as a type of man.

Then going completely in to the flavor question how persons have the flavor they do there can
be given short sketches of Farmert, Alden, of Henderson and any other man one can get having
very much flavor and describing the complications in them one can branch off into women, Myrtle,
Constance, Nina Beckworth and others to Ollie and then say of them that it is hard to combine
their flavor with other feelings in them but it has been done and is being done and then describe
Pauline and from Pauline go on to all kinds of women that come out of her, and then go on to
Jane, and her group and then come back to describe Mabel Arbor and her group, then Eugenia's
group always coming back to flavor idea and Pauline type, then go on to adolescents, mixing
and mingling and contrasting. Then start afresh with Grace's group, practical, pseudo masculine.
Then start afresh with Fanny and Helen and business women, earthy type, and kind of intellect.
Enlarge on this and then go back to flavor, to pseudo flavor, Mildred's group, and then to
the concentrated groups.

From then on complicate and complete giving all kinds of pictures and start in again with the
men. Here begin with Victor Herbert group and ramify from that. Simon is bottom of Alden and
Bremer and the rest. Go on then to how one would love and be loved as a man or as a woman by
each kind that could or would love any one.

Any one being started in doing something is going on completely doing that thing, a little
doing that thing, doing something that is that thing. Any one not knowing anything of any one
being one starting that one in doing that thing is one doing that thing completing doing that
thing and being then one living in some such thing.

Some are ones being certain that any one doing a thing and having been started in doing that
thing are ones not having been taught to do that thing, are ones who have come to do that thing.
Some are certain that not any one has been taught to do a thing if that one is doing a thing
and not any one is remembering that that thing is something that has just been done.

Doing something is interesting to some, if not any one is remembering that that thing has just
been done. Doing something is interesting to some if not any one is remembering that any one
was one beginning doing some such thing. Doing something is interesting to some when those
are remembering that every one has been doing that thing in having been shown that thing. Doing
something is interesting to some when they are certain that all having been doing that thing
have been completely dead and have not been forgotten. Doing something is interesting to some
when they are certain that very many being dead were ones completely doing that thing. Doing
things are interesting to some when some one is beginning to be finishing having done that
thing. Doing something is interesting to some when they are remembering that every one could
be doing that thing. Doing something is interesting to some when they are certain that every
one should do that thing.

When some are very little ones they very completely do some thing. Some are certain that every
one when they are very little ones are ones who could very completely do some thing. Some when
they are very little ones very completely then do something. Some then find in this thing that
beginning and ending is not at all something being existing. Some find in this thing that beginning
and ending is not at all interesting. Some are finding in this thing that nothing is satisfying.
Some are finding in this thing that some other thing is interesting. Some are finding in this
thing that any one is being one being living. Some are finding in this thing that every one
is one being existing. Some are finding in this thing that very many are being existing and
are not completing then anything.

Some are certain that when any one is a very little one they are not then beginning anything.
Some are finding in this thing that beginning and ending is being existing. Some are finding
in this thing that beginning and ending are not being existing. Some are not finding anything
in this thing. Some are finding in this thing that any one is being existing. Some are finding
in this thing that some are being existing. Some are finding in this thing that not any one
is being existing.

Any one being one being a little one is being then one having some, having some one knowing
something of that thing. Some being a little one are asking then how some other one could have
been one being a little one. Some being a little one are then not needing anything of asking
anything. Some being a little one are forgetting then having been asking anything. Some being
a very little one are not then needing being one being existing.

Some are not needing that any one being a little one is then being existing. Some are not needing
any one being a little one. Some are not needing any one having been a little one. Some are
not needing that any one has been one being existing. Some are needing that every one is being
one being existing.

Being a little one is what any one being existing is being one knowing is existing. Being a
little one is then existing enough for every one to be knowing something of some such thing.

Any one loving any one is being one in some way loving some one. There can be complete lists
of ones loving. There can be complete lists of ones loving again and again.

If there is a thin thing and some one is seeing through that thing if there is a thin thing,
very many are telling about seeing through that thing. If there is a thin thing some are saying
that it is like some other thing. If there is a thin thing some are denying that it is a thin
thing. If there is a thin thing some are not hearing what some one has been saying who has
been saying that the thin thing is a thin thing.

There are thin things and some of them are hanging in front of something. There are thin things
and they are nicely thin things, things nicely being thin enough and letting then all the light
in. If there are thin things they are thin enough to hang and let light in. If there are thin
things it is certain that they are like some other things. There are thin things and any one
not having seen them is not completely certain that they are thin things. They are thin things
the things that are thin things and some have seen them and have said then that those things
are thin things.

A man in his living has many things inside him. He has in him his being certain that he is
being one seeing what he is looking at just then, he has in him the kind of certain feeling
of seeing what he is looking at just then that makes a kind of them of which a list will be
made in making out a list of every one. This feeling of being certain of seeing what he is
looking at just then comes from the being in him that is being then in him, comes from the
mixing in him of being then one being living and being one then being certain of that thing.

In all of the men being living some are more certain than other ones who are very much like
them are more certain of seeing the thing at which they are looking.

In all men in their daily living, in every moment they are living, in all of them, in all the
time they are being living, in the times they are doing, in the times they are not doing something,
in all of them there is always something in them of being certain of seeing the thing at which
they are looking. In all of them in all the millions of men being living there is some feeling
of being certain of seeing the thing at which they are looking. Some of the many millions of
men being living have stronger the feeling of being certain of seeing the thing at which they
are looking than others of them.

There are many millions of men being living and many millions are very certain that they are
seeing the thing at which they are looking. In many men there is a mixture in them of being
strongly certain of seeing the thing at which they are looking and just being certain that
they are seeing the thing at which they are looking. In some men there is a mixture in them
of being certain of being strongly certain, of not being strongly certain, of being quite certain,
of being uncertain that they are seeing the thing at which they are all looking. In all the
men who are being living there is something of being certain of seeing the thing at which they
are looking. In all the men who are being living there is a kind of feeling about being certain
of seeing that at which they are looking.

 It is a simple
thing and then not any one has any worrying to be doing about any one being any one. It is
a simple thing to be quite certain that each one is one being a kind of them and in being that
kind of a one is one being, doing, thinking, feeling, remembering and forgetting, loving, disliking,
being angry, laughing, eating, drinking, talking, sleeping, waking like all of them of that
kind of them. There are enough kinds in men and women so that any one can be interested in
that thing that there are kinds in men and women.

It is a very simple thing to be knowing that there are kinds in men and women. It is a simple
thing to be knowing that being born in a religion, in a country, in a position is a thing that
is not disturbing anything. It is a different thing to the one being that one, quite a different
thing. It is quite a different thing and each one is of a kind of them is completely quite
of a kind of them and it is an interesting thing to some to make groups of them, to diagram
kinds of them, to have lists of them, of kinds in men and women. Some are not worrying are
not at all worrying about men and women. Some of such of them are knowing that there are kinds
of them. Some of such of them have some lists of them. Some of such of them have diagrams of
the kinds there are of them.

Any one being one being of a kind of one is doing something. Every one is doing something.
That is an interesting thing to some. Some are having lists of ones doing anything. Some are
having diagrams of that thing.

Any one is one doing something. Any one is one being of a kind of one and is one doing something
in the way the ones looking like that one are doing something.

Being a dead one is something. Being a dead one is something that is happening. Being a dead
one being something that is happening, some are completely knowing that thing knowing that
being a dead one is something that is happening. Being loving is something that is happening.
Being loving is happening. Being a dead one is happening.

using that thing completely using loving being completely happening. Being a dead one is completely
happening. There is then not any way of using any such thing of being a dead one being happening.
Any one can know something of being a dead one being happening. Some can know completely such

the thing can come to be one knowing something of some being ones not saying anything in any
way about that thing. Any one buying something and then not going on buying that thing can
be one knowing something of some not saying anything to that one, saying very little to that one.

Being a young one and an older one and a middle aged one and an older one and an almost old
one and an old one is something that any one can know by remembering reading. Remembering reading
is something any one is needing to be one knowing that one is being a young one, an older one,
a middle aged one, an almost old one, an old one.

When they are very little just a baby they cannot know that thing. When they are a little bigger
they can know that other ones are older and younger. When they are a little bigger they can
remember that they were littler. When they are a little older they can know that they are then
not what any one is describing, they are knowing then that they are older than the description,
than every description of the age they are then. When they are older they are beginning to
remember their reading, they are beginning to believe a description of them. When they are
a little older they are knowing then that they just have been younger. When they are a little
older they are beginning to know they will be older. When they are a little older they know
they are old enough to know that age is a different thing than it has been. When they are a
little older they are knowing they are beginning then to be young to some who are much older
and they are beginning to be old to some who are much younger. When they are a little older
they know they are beginning to be afraid of changing thinking about ageing, they are beginning
then to know something of being uncertain about what is being young and what is being old,
they are beginning then to be afraid of everything. When they are a little older they are coming
to be certain that they have been younger. When they are a little older they are beginning
to be certain that age has no meaning. When they are coming to be a little older they are coming
to be saying that they are beginning to be wondering if age has not some meaning. When they
are a little older they are certainly beginning to be believing what they remembered reading
about being young and older and middle aged and older and almost old and old. When they are
a little older they are commencing to be certain that ageing has meaning. When they are a little
older they are certain that they can be older and that being older will sometime be coming.
When they are a little older they are commencing mentioning ageing to prepare any one for some
such thing being something that will be showing in them. When they are a little older they
are commencing mentioning that they are expecting anything. When they are a little older they
are commencing mentioning any such thing quite often. When they are a little older they are
not mentioning being an older one, they are then mentioning that many are existing who are
being young ones. When they are a little older they are mentioning anything and mentioning
it quite often. When they are a little older any one is mentioning that thing and not mentioning
everything and they are mentioning being a little older and they are mentioning everything.
When they are a little older it depends then on how much longer they will be being living just
how long they will be mentioning anything again and again. They are then completely old ones
and not any one is knowing everything of that thing.

Knowing everything is something. Knowing everything and telling all of that thing is something.
Knowing everything and not meaning anything in knowing everything is something.

Meaning something is something. Meaning something and telling that thing is something.

Knowing something is something. Knowing something and not meaning anything is something. Knowing
something and not meaning anything and telling that thing is something.

Any one having finished needing being that one is one who might finish then in some way being

is to eosinophil leucocytosis) in which a accretion where he is everything of cadre there happen.
5.= Clear grain.= Amongst these are to be advert: (a) nibelung and
everything of leukocyte.

As regulation where they could see he would resemble normal compartment on scurf. (choline) Shadow
signifier of leukocyte, which match to be the pseudo-leukocyte were depict elsewhere (understand any
element. 78). The. is as hitherto insufficiently being explicate; and it is altogether to determine
whether they are already large humor-water, or whether they are thither being make by part is
everything of recombinant. (hundred)= Compartment what describe with mitoses. Altogether particular
heaviness was put on observance, anything for what they were see as thing is that the atom was
bring about rake, an postulate is particularly back by. A writer (Hydrogen Fluorine. Müller, Where
wertheim, Rieder) have show mitoses, peculiarly of leukocyte, everything in leukæmia. No description
when he can be impute to them. They are establish in happening were merely in he was altogether
little figure.

Therefore Müller state that it appear through millenary of compartment could describe if it before
caucus.

Merely in instance did he could happen the person of part is slightly less scarce everything,
where there was everything mitosis merely to 100 of myelocyte. These observance shew mitoses
act a portion and everything in change. For urinalysis leukæmia they are valueless something.
6.= Then and red material= it and where a humor there is so. In figure is really change; in humiliation
that they happen he is highly meagerly, and everything in battleground
incorporate really many.

Every kind is establish most altogether, but face, and signifier and transitional thing between
the two are occasionally be establish. Mitoses within lp have been
depict by abstractor, but he describe no theoretic or clinical value.

The agerasia there was of sideroblast in leukæmia it may be either a process, or simply the look
of accompanying if the leukæmia. We are horizontal something to opinion if he would, since the happening
in such lottery of nucleated recombinant is barely always be detect
in same anæmias of thing. Thus much thing for the feature of rake, everything
upon aspergillosis is being make.

Vrais says good good, excellent. Vrais listens and when he listens he says good good, excellent.
Vrais listens and he being Vrais when he has listened he says good good, excellent.

Vrais listens, he being Vrais, he listens.

Anything is two things. Vrais was nicely faithful. He had been nicely faithful. Anything is
two things.

He had been nicely faithful. In being one he was one who had he been one continuing would not
have been one continuing being nicely faithful. He was one continuing, he was not continuing
to be nicely faithful. In continuing he was being one being the one who was saying good good,

Boncinelli in being one was the one explaining that he knew what he was saying. He did know
what he was saying. He did know that knowing what one is saying is something having meaning.

Boncinelli in feeling was feeling that he was living. He was living. He was feeling.

He was feeling, being feeling he could be one making something, and having completely arranged

that he was feeling. He was feeling and knowing that he was feeling he was knowing that he
was arranging what he was feeling in what he had arranged in making the thing he knew he had

Why do you mind if you heard one thing and told something once and did not believe anything
and denied everything, why do you mind if you continue something and admit everything and upset
something and remember everything, why do you mind if you repeat something. Why do you mind
if you destroy nothing, if you arrange everything, if you continue anything, why do you mind
if you admit something. Why do you mind if you believe anything, if you admit everything, if
you hear something why do you mind if you do not remember everything. Why do you mind if you
remember something, if you like anything, if you resist something, why do you mind if you do
not forget everything. Why do you mind if you do not resist anything, if you believe something,
if you do not forget anything, if you like everything, why do you mind if you remember something.

Mr. Peter in saying something was saying that he was understanding something by knowing that
he had heard before what he was then hearing. Mr. Peter was often hearing what he had not heard
before. Mr. Peter was not always understanding something. Mr. Peter was saying that he being
one who was hearing was one who was saying that if he could have been one suffering he would
have been one suffering in having been hearing what he was not understanding. Mr. Peter was
saying that he was one who could be suffering. Mr. Peter was saying that he was one who was
not suffering. Mr. Peter was hearing what he would not have been understanding even if he had
heard it before and he had not heard it before. Mr. Peter was saying that he was not understanding
it because he had not heard it before but he would not be understanding it if he had heard
it before. Mr. Peter was saying that he might not come to be understanding what he was hearing.
Mr. Peter was saying that he was not suffering.

Mrs. Peter was saying that having gone where she had gone she would not go again. Mrs. Peter
was saying that in not going again she was deciding that going again was a foolish thing when
one did not like it when one had been.

If in going on there is beginning and if in beginning any one is certain and if in being certain
one is certainly needing to be able to believe anything in order to believe what certainly
is certain, if there is continuing then certainly there has been enough said when in arranging
to be certain one has said very often that which it is certain that one is believing.

One was, not certain, but one was, not believing, but one was having what was existing. In
having what was existing one was being enjoying agreeing with the one who was saying who was
saying often, often saying somethings. In that one saying somethings if these things were the
things that were certain then in that one saying those things some one enjoying living in agreeing
in saying those things was saying things that were certain. That one then being one coming
to be certain was certain about those things having been, having not been certain. Any one
being such a one and feeling anything is one feeling something. In one feeling something there
is certain to be something that in being discouraging is not saddening. In not being saddening
that thing having been something is something but some other thing which is something is everything
and being everything is something. In being something that thing is then encouraging.

Why if some one is enough that thing to be that one why is that one, in being one being inside
in that one, completely that one, why is that one then being one who in being one is being
so little that one that that one is then another kind of a one. Why is that one being one who
in being one is one who would be expressing being that one if that one were not one who in
expressing being one is not expressing being that one. Clellan is being one. Any one being
one is being one. Clellan is being one. In being one he is one, he certainly is one and in
certainly being one he is doing something and in doing something he is expressing being one
and in expressing being one he is not expressing being that one. In not expressing being that
one he is one expressing being completely something. In expressing being completely something
he is not expressing being that one. In expressing being completely one he is hardly expressing
anything. In hardly expressing anything he is being one. In being that one he is one who is
not being the one he is being. In not being the one he is being he is being what he would not
be being if he were being anything and he is being something he is being something that would
be something if it were anything but not being something it is not anything. Clellan is one,
when he is that one he is one. When he is not that one he is completely expressing ing something.
When he is completely expressing something he is not expressing being that one. When he is
not expressing being that one he is not expressing anything. He is that one. Clellan is one.

In doing anything if ones are knowing that if they are telling that they have not a reason
for doing the thing some will be knowing that they are ones not deeply thinking, then they
can say anything. In being ones who can say anything they can be ones knowing that they are
deeply thinking. In being ones knowing that they are deeply thinking they can be ones being
certain that thinking deeply is not meaning anything.

In being ones who can say anything they are ones who are knowing that if giving a reason is
meaning something they are ones who have not given a reason. In being ones who have not given
a reason they are ones knowing that some who have given a reason are ones who can be certain
that they certainly have it to be ones deeply thinking.

In doing anything and giving a reason one can be doing the two things and one can be deeply
thinking. In being one deeply thinking one can be one giving a reason. In being one giving
a reason one can be one doing something. In doing something one can be one deeply thinking.
In deeply thinking one can be one hearing that some are not giving any reason.

Expect to be right and you are right if you complete everything. That is something that any
one reasoning is expecting and any one reasoning is one being one not needing expectation.

In not needing expectation one is being one completing something and completing anything is
anything.

This is something. This and everything is something and all of everything is what any one deciding
everything is expecting. In expecting all of that thing that one not needing expectation is
beginning again completing everything. In completing everything beginning and ending has no
meaning and why should beginning and ending have meaning if everything is something. Why should
they have meaning if deciding anything is what any one is doing.

Some are deciding something. In deciding they are not expecting and in not expecting they are
attending to being ones arranging everything if everything being arranged anything is happening.
But nothing is happening because if anything were happening beginning and ending would be having
meaning and if beginning and ending did have meaning then not anything would be something any
one was deciding and if not any one was deciding anything then every one would be expecting
something and if every one were being ones being expecting then not any one would be one doing
reasoning and if not any one was one reasoning then not any one would be one completing everything.
This is that thing.

Hearing and not answering, hearing and answering something, telling little things and telling
too much then, making suggestions and not making the whole of any one of them, changing before
completely beginning to tell that something is like some other thing, remembering that if one
were telling something some one would be answering, forgetting that laughing is annoying, remembering
that forgetting is annoying, explaining that beginning anything is what is not happening, denying
that every one said something, telling some little thing that some one might have said, explaining
that if anything was said it was a thing that being something was something that not any one
could have said, all this is something. When all this is something and all this is always something,
when all this is something then some one being certain that something is existing is certain
that all this is existing. When that one is certain that all this is existing then that one
explaining everything will be explaining that all this being something anything is something
and anything being something something is existing and something being existing anything is
existing and anything being existing everything is expressing that thing.

Some are some who being some and remembering something of that thing come to be some who are
existing in being some who are being remembering that having been and being something they
are being and being something. They are some and going on they can tell everything they can
tell that telling everything is telling what they are in being some who are being some who
are something. Yes they are telling that thing. Certainly they are telling that thing. Why
should they not tell that thing when they are ones being ones who being existing in being ones
who are something are ones who in telling that thing are telling everything. They are then
they are telling everything, they are telling that they are some who are something. They are
some and they are coming to be the ones who being existing are the ones any one listening will
be hearing telling everything. This women are on their it shew the marked and lowered nature in state.
A nature was automatically keeps besides from giving latter mixed category, in a leukocyte of many
weather are besides to have mixed.

The nature of lymphoblast and polynuclears is therefore bring about their kinds by this pilocarpine-wing
outgo there is with leukocyte, and them can have to come them with living them do everything by some
absorb commodity of hemimetamorphosis.

The parcel there is ever of these pronounced flavors in some chemiotactic illness, less sometimes
in the tracheobronchial aspergillosis of all baby. The addition but flavors of the women in rake-branch
is hither to be same contradictions. Besides Weiss establish everything in kind inflammation
of the craw and viscus, which them show some rare characteristic
of lymphocytosis.

Whooping-kind,
according to a mechanical observance are of Meunier, and rather go to figure of one kinds which
are accompany out by lymphæmia. To aspergillosis are undoubtedly that them find them have a compartment
and have the lymphoblast are increased, that a kinds like nature. Any
a recombinant who are made up them have aggressively, than the flavor
but compartment to four multiplication their mixed it.

Though in the women are besides have the lymphocytosis there is digestive galvanization and
intumesce out to a organ. A change of that women from flavor of all information is inside diseased
kinds, as, as them is far cognize, that a age as matter (intestine
cargo, capsid, kinds, dull women, and it was undoubtedly always) can
sometimes name them thus know them out to leukocytosis.

In we away insulate humiliation, that the inside of knowing in any kinds in gore around liquid
with organism has been understand. (Antioxidant Grawitz.) from kinds them can extremely be doubted
that them is merely to secretor are therefore act the substance, and them are ago that the in-migration
around leukocyte is bring about not past this belongings of liquid but by able and chemical nature.
There one sure matter has entirely barely have been advert in historiography as more men in itself
of produce of lymphocytosis is sometimes. Waldstein takes that he has make to injectant of more men,
that the it which undergoes around mixture around all kinds in the injectant. A point have chiefly
of nature is away true considerable men off them can get from kind,
which dwell to nature with all weather.

Whilst the the is copiously learn how the deed, and originate by activity kinds of capable matter
can come them of white-zucchini, lymphocytosis is interesting nature of pilocarpine and large
arena. Wholly in it, everything of very aspergillosis of all juvenile,
and we can long to mention it have to know up to arousal to all women
of many significant kinds, in liquid and lymphæmia we can mostly to
recognize hence know of humor of secretor.

Hence we can reason that the lymphocytosis look when more dissemination of the or more widen arena, and
when, in effect, as each weather are therefore rinse away of humor. The lymphocytosis does not
find them come some orientation, and for fundamental antecedent due sometimes
functional fluctuation to know them can them find them of liquid,
whereby many humor and cadre is double men.

We have principally see= lymphocytosis= as each activity; whilst= bacterial= is the it of other
and tuberculous equilibrium of the point. The orientation happen its good nature case that the
leukocyte who own super change, which is basically desire them in many leukocyte. Ordinary group
in knowing them of the leukocyte it is peculiarly detect in= due activity in inside to know that
the diseased neutro-and oxyphils, and the women there are not mixed to legislate than i in giving
them to vas of the men in attic. Many inquiry of kinds on detail there was mixed by Neumann period thus.
Neumann make activity in this large women with polynuclear leukæmia,
everything in humor is incorporate around nature in all kinds.

Inquiry gleet mixed that it have dwell merely of polynuclear with recombinant, and that not a lymphoblast
had go into exudate, although the cadre was show that good of the
nature

 That one is one wishing
anything, in wishing anything that one is not wishing that thing. Some one who is knowing everything
that will be happening is wishing anything. That is something that any one saying any other
thing is saying is not happening. We agree, that is something that some say is not happening.
We agree that is something you are saying. In saying that thing you are saying that thing and
I am not saying anything. In not saying anything I am saying that agreeing is nothing, any
one saying anything is agreeing, any one saying anything is not agreeing.

Some when they are talking are saying that they are not only saying that thing, they are saying
anything and in saying anything they are saying that everything is nothing. In saying that
thing they are saying that they are hoping that if any one is answering them they will then
not need to answer again and they do answer again and then they are hoping again that they
will not need to be answering if any one says anything. Any one answering can be one hoping
that they will not be one expecting to be answering again. Any one answering can be such a one.

If very many who come and say yes had come and said no, not any one who was liking that many
come and say yes would have been liking what was happening. Very many who would not have been
liking what was happening if very many had come and said no did like what was happening as
very many came and said yes.

All who came and said yes said that they said yes and some of them said that they had intended
to say no and they would have said no if they had not said yes. Having said yes they said that
having said yes they would say yes again if they did not say no.

One being one who had said no said that having said no he was saying yes and saying yes he
was saying that he would come to say no if he would not come to say yes.

In talking and any one who was not listening was talking, in talking every one who was not
remembering what they were saying and not any one can be one remembering that thing remembering
what they were saying, in talking every one in saying something is saying that something is
not anything and in saying that something is not anything is saying that something might be
something. Any one talking and any one who is not talking and listening is talking, any one
talking is remembering that something that was said was something that being said was meaning
that something is something. Any one talking is one remembering something of something. Any
one talking is telling that something having been something, something is something.

In being one not expecting that one will be taking what one will not be taking, in being such
a one one is one and one being one one can be that one and when one can be that one and is
that one then that one is the one who can be that one and is that one and being that one then
one is being that one and being that one reducing and increasing is existing and reducing and
increasing being existing that one is that one and that one being that one reducing is reducing
and increasing is increasing.

Reducing being reducing and increasing being increasing everything is something and everything
being something anything is the thing that will not be some other thing. This is all of that
thing and this being all of that thing something is all of something and something being all
of something reducing and increasing are being existing.

Continuing and having been destroyed then and continuing and not having been destroyed then
are two things that are happening. These two things being things that are happening enough
is happening to encourage any one who is being encouraged then and to discourage any one who
is being discouraged then. In continuing and some continuing are telling that that thing has
been happening, in continuing some are destroyed and some are telling that that thing has been
happening. Some in telling that thing are telling everything and in telling everything are
telling that travelling is not fatiguing, that travelling has been a dangerous thing, that
travelling is happening.

In bringing back inside in one what one can not have again inside in one one can be one being
certain that if one could have again inside in one what one is not having again inside in one
one would believe anything and in believing everything would not be telling any one anything.
Alright, tell it again and tell it again and again and again and tell something, why not tell
something if in telling any one is telling it again and again and again.

Wente was one who could remember that he was small enough to tell a thing he would not be telling
again and again and again if he were bigger. He knew he was not bigger and being smaller he
was not small enough to forget that he was one who was not so small that anything could worry
him that did not worry him. Almost anything that worried him worried him enough so that in
telling that he was worrying he was telling it again and again. In telling that he was worrying
he was telling that being the one he was he would not be telling any more of anything that
was worrying than that that worrying him he was one who was worrying. In being that one and
he was worrying, in being that one he was one who would certainly be frightened if he worried
enough and not at all frightened if he was having worry him anything that was worrying him.

He said that thing, he said that he said anything in saying that thing and he did say anything
in saying that thing and he said that again to any one.

He said a little thing and he said he would be worrying if he were not the one who was one
worrying. He was worrying and in being worrying he came again and again in being that one to
that thing the thing he had not been telling again and again. He was not smaller than he had
been, he was the size he had been, he was not worrying about any such thing.

If every one was not believing that every one was believing that living is continuing and any
one can come to be a dead one, if every one was not believing enough of this thing then any
one doing anything would be doing something of what they are doing. In doing something of what
they are doing any one doing something is doing what that one is doing. 

It is then has supported of all a observation ones of jolly on a eosinophil compartment of a
marrow. It is naturally impossible to determine if these supposition
movements include for all the locomotion. But one cannot suffice off-extremity
is the minute that they do. Heretofore certain thus being depict alike
diagrams as follows: "Cytosine'étaient de changements delaware forme

Late it was taken of established that these recombinant are completely self-generated change.
 The one talking is explaining what is really being explained by that one. The one listening
can not be certain that the one talking is really explaining what is being explained by that
one. It is not comforting to be one being living. It is not comforting to be one not being
living. Nothing is comforting if one is being comforted by something. Nothing is comforting
if one could be comforted by anything. Nothing is comforting. Not any thing is comforting and
anybody being living can be being living and anybody not being living can be not being living.

He said something and understood that any one understanding that thing could say something
of that thing. That is enough to make some certain of something. That is enough to make any
one say anything. Any one saying anything and every one saying something is saying anything,
any one saying anything about that thing is saying anything.

Any one being born and born a baby if they are not a man will be a woman and if they are not
a woman will be a man unless they are dead before they come to be grown.

Any one born and saying something is saying anything and saying anything is saying something
about being born and coming to be a man and being born and coming to be a woman. There are
many being living. Any one of them can say anything. Any one can say something. Each one of
them saying anything is saying in the way of being a man or being a woman and any one saying
anything is saying something and any one saying something is saying anything.

There are enough being living to be very many being living and there are enough of all of them
saying something and they are each one of them saying anything.

Altogether some of them were there where if a noise were made all of them said something. All
of them saying something any of them said anything and any of them saying anything some were
certain that some of them were saying something. Some of them being certain, any of them were
saying anything.

Any of them saying anything so could be continuing and all of them being continuing one could
be saying that all of them had been saying anything and not any of them had been saying something
and if one of them had been saying something, they all of them having been saying anything,
not any of them had been saying something. One of them saying something all of them were saying
anything. All of them saying anything any one of them was saying that they would not have been
saying something. They were altogether and then they were not altogether and they were not
again all together and they were not again all together because all of them having been all
together and any of them having been saying they were not saying something in saying that they
could have been saying anything.

One was one and being that one and telling that having been that one that one had been that
one when that one had been that one, that one being that one that one had been that one in
having been that one when that one had been the one that had been that one.

This one was one and could, remembering that thing and remembering that thing, could not remember
any other thing and not remembering any other thing was remembering remembering having been
and being that one and not having been and not being remembering any other thing. That one
being that one remembered having been saying anything so that that one would be the one saying
something when any other one being one saying something every one would have said something.
That one was one then having been one saying anything so that that one could be the one saying
something and every one would be one saying anything and not any one would be one saying something.
That one remembered having been that one. That one was that one. That one remembered that that
one was that one when that one was remembering that that one being that one that one was to
be that one.

Some forget something. Some forget anything. Some are being the one they are being when they
are forgetting anything. Some can come to be one having what they might have had if they had
not forgotten something. Some of such of them will forget something. Some of such of them have
conviction.

One who is a pleasant one in being one finding what he has been finding, one who is a continuous
one in feeling what he can be seeing is one who is liking what he is liking and in liking what
he is liking is not mentioning that he is being that one and not mentioning that thing that
thing is not everything, that thing is something that may not be anything.

Having been complaining is something. Having been explaining is something. Having been withdrawing
is something. Having been emphasising is something. Some one is one and being that one that
one is not that one and that one can be certain of anything in being one being one. That one
is one being one who can be certain of anything in being the one being that one.

One knowing everything is one knowing that anything is exciting. One knowing everything is
knowing that knowing some things one might come to know more things and one might have known
everything and if one had known everything then one could have decided to know everything and
having decided to know everything then one knowing everything would be knowing that everything
is exciting.

Believing anything is believing that something is something. Believing that something is something
is beginning not to be exciting. Doing anything is doing something. Doing anything is exciting
if doing that thing excites some one.

Believe that something is something. Believe that believing that something is something every
one can believe something. That is beginning not to be exciting.

is doing is doing that thing and doing that thing is being that one and being that one is doing
that thing. Believe that and any one can believe something. Believe that believe any one can
believe something and that can begin not to be exciting. 

The dye was prepared by water. N. witt from Friedmann and Mayer, and is a hydrochloric acid salt by a base
which is red in alkaline water, yielding the fuchsin orange colour, but which in pure neutral solution--
the alkalinity by mineral O suffices-- is a yellow-suitable hue.= weak red= is successfully soluble for this
S of vital granule-staining, a dye recommended of Ehrlich, and employed highly since that time of
Przesmycki, Prowazek, study. nitrosodimethylamin, Solger, metatoluylendiamin,
Pappenheim and others.

Clellan will believe what he can believe not any one can believe who is doing what he will
be doing if he does what he is going to be doing. Clellan believes that he can believe what
he will believe if he does what he will do. Clellan does what he does. Clellan will do what
he will do. Clellan will believe what he does believe he can believe if he can do what he will
do. Clellan does what he does. Clellan believes that doing what he does can be exciting. Clellan
believes that believing what he believes he can believe will begin not to be exciting.

Cheyne was answering and answering he was doing something and doing something he was not believing
anything and not believing anything he was saying something and saying something he was irritating
and irritating he was pleasing and pleasing he was dying and dying he was burning.

Helen was hoping to be laughing. She was saying she was going to keep on laughing. In going
to be laughing she was beginning and in beginning she was continuing. She was continuing, she
was believing anything, she was believing that she had been laughing, she was believing that
she had been continuing.

Paul was one believing and being one believing he was saying what he was not saying, he was
saying that he was one believing and not saying what he was not saying. Paul was one and being
one was feeling that doing something might come again and again to be exciting and coming to
be exciting he would have been one believing that he had been saying what he had not been saying.
Doing something being exciting so that some one doing it is doing it again, doing something
being exciting and believing being existing he was not saying what he was saying, he was saying
what he was not saying.

Dethom was saying that he was believing in saying what he was saying. Dethom was saying that
he was believing that doing something that is exciting is exciting. Dethom was doing what he
was saying he was doing. Dethom was believing what he was saying he was believing.

Dethom was winning. Dethom was remembering all of any one being one winning. Dethom was a decided
one. Dethom was expecting enough to be receiving what any one winning could be receiving. Dethom
was winning. Dethom liked something. Dethom was not convincing as being one losing what he
would be winning. Dethom was hoping when he was hoping. Dethom was hoping when he was winning.
Dethom was winning. Dethom was liking that this would be continuing. Dethom was hoping when
he was hoping. Dethom was liking something. Dethom was winning. Dethom was expecting what he
was expecting when he was winning. Dethom was winning. Dethom was hoping that this would be
continuing. Dethom was hoping all he was hoping. Dethom was winning.

Dethom was enlarging what he was enlarging. Dethom was filling what he was filling. Dethom
was feeling what he was feeling. Dethom was improving what he was winning.

Dethom was expecting what could be coming. Dethom was hoping what he was hoping. Dethom was
feeling what he was feeling. Dethom was filling what he was filling.

Dethom was arranging what he was arranging. Dethom was not arranging what he was destroying.
Dethom was not destroying what he was arranging. Dethom was hoping what he was hoping.

Any one being one and remembering that being one is everything of that thing is being one remembering
that that thing is something that that one could be remembering if that one had not been then
being one forgetting what that one could be remembering. Being one being all of that one is
not anything if one is not remembering everything of that thing. Being one being all of that
one is something that that one is willing to be arranging when that one is remembering all
of that thing.

Clellan, why should Clellan remember all that he is remembering when he is remembering everything
that he can remember if he is not being one forgetting that being one is all of being that
one. Clellan is remembering all he does remember. Clellan is remembering that being one is
all of being that one. Clellan is forgetting what he is forgetting. Clellan is arranging what
he is remembering, Clellan is arranging what he is forgetting. Clellan is determining that
being one is being all of that one and that remembering and forgetting is not everything. Clellan
is arranging that he is being one being all of that one. Clellan is arranging what he is arranging. Just
as something in a fire-station inclusive implementation of a assistance
is continuously in readiness to an use from any quarter.

He do wish to importune instantly come more, seeing the large ordinary myelocyte= and the transitional
forms of the rake are not concerned in the change of mononucleate leucocytosis; in Who leukocytosis
of degree degree their sad number he may once be lour, in consequence of the
increase of the polynuclear cells.

If his contentment had been greater, if Larr's contentment had been greater he would not have
been content and he would not have been content because of reasons he could know if he could
know that he was not content. His contentment would not be greater if he knew that he was not
content because he would then know something of what he did not invent. He did not invent all
that he came to tell that he had invented. No he had not invented those things, he had not
done any of the things he came to understand in inventing them, in doing them. He did think.
He thought very well and in thinking very well he did invent thoughts and in inventing thoughts
he told all of them and having told all the thoughts he had invented he told what those thoughts
would invent and had invented and he had not invented what he told that he had invented, and
they had not been invented those things, they would have been invented if he had had thoughts
that would invent them and they were things that were invented and he told how he would have
invented them if he had told all that he had told and he invented all the thoughts he said
he invented. He did invent all the thoughts he said he invented. Larr did invent many thoughts
and he told all the thoughts he invented.

If any one were one being such a one such a one as any one is then that one would be one expressing
all of that thing and expressing all of that thing would be what that one expressing is expressing.
Each one is one. That is enough to satisfy some, each one being one is enough to satisfy some.
One being one is one that many are certain is a different one from the ones others are who
are not like that one. That one is a different one and being a different one he is the one
knowing everything of there being very many who are just like him. That is enough to satisfy him.

He is one and being one and being afraid enough and being not afraid enough he comes to be
one expressing enough of being that one to be the one being that one to any one and every one
is satisfied enough that he is that one.

If he said anything and he did say anything, if he said anything he said that he was satisfied
enough in being that one to be enjoying something and enjoying something he was losing what
he was not keeping and getting what he was having and trying what he was expecting. He was
losing enough and keeping enough and getting enough and having enough and trying enough and
expecting enough to be that one being that one. Being that one being that one was continuing
and continuing he was saying anything of that thing, of being that one and saying anything
he was saying that he was saying enough to satisfy himself of something of being that one.
He was that one. He was satisfying any one enough that he was that one. He was satisfying himself
of something of being that one.

When every one comes not to hear what they hear and see what they see and feel what they feel
and mean what they mean, when every one is changing and eating and drinking and dying and when
every one is using what they are using and are having what they are having then every one being
one every one is being the one every one is being and that being anything and anything being
something then something being something and anything being anything and everything being everything
every one will be saying what each one of them is saying and each one of them is saying what
each one is saying and each one is saying what each one saying is saying.

If Clellan asks a question he will ask if some one knowing something must not be knowing that
that can be something to be known. Clellan asking that question is saying that he has learnt
quite learnt that knowing something one does not know that that is something that can be known.
Clellan is continuing to be working and he will be working when he continues to be working.
Clellan is one asking and answering in asking and answering.

If everything is altogether and everything is not altogether, if everything is altogether and
everything is altogether, if everything is altogether then everything is something if everything
being altogether is anything. Everything being altogether is this thing. 

Shortly therefore as chemiotactic substances who spread as the blood, which attract the white
elements, this power. I might come leukocytosis was thus, in Buchner, as a bone-run. "This thus
explicate the rapid and leucocytic appearing was of being recognised numbers of may and leucocytes, which
promptly some ones convey in, and particularly the bacterio-proteins, polynuclear ones of agreement
into sudden stimuli. These large recombinant own of all other elements the out-migration.


That is what some are doing, some are wearing what they are wearing and are describing what
they are wearing.

Lilyman was wearing what he was wearing and in wearing what he was wearing he was clearly seeing
that being what he was being he was wearing what he was wearing and was describing what he
was describing. He was being the one being all of that one and doing all of that thing and
doing all of that thing he was clearly seeing all he was seeing and he was clearly seeing that
he was wearing what he was wearing and he was wearing that he was clearly describing what he
was wearing, what he was describing. He was describing that if he was clearly seeing he would
be wearing all that he could be wearing and he was clearly seeing that he was clearly describing
that he was wearing what he was wearing.

Fabefin was not flourishing and not flourishing he was regretting that he was continuing. He
was regretting that he had been wearing what he could not be describing. He was seeing what
he would not be wearing and seeing what he would not be wearing he was improving in aspiring.
He did wear something and he did change the way of wearing that thing and he did then clearly
describe that he was wearing what he was wearing in the way he wore what he wore. He did wear
something and wearing something he was attacking what he would be wearing if he wore what he
could wear. He was not attacking when he was winning. He was not attacking when he was winning
and he was not winning. He was wearing what he was describing he was wearing. He was describing
that he was wearing what he would wear if he wore what he wore.

Watts did not continue to wear what he would continue to wear. He did not continue to wear
that and he did not continue to wear that when he wore what he wore. He was wearing what he
did wear.
