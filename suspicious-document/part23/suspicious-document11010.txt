MADAM HOW AND LADY WHY or, FIRST LESSONS IN EARTH LORE FOR CHILDREN

DEDICATION

To my son Grenville Arthur, and to his school-fellows at Winton House This little book is dedicated.

PREFACE

My dear boys,--When I was your age, there were no such children's books as there are now. 
Those which we had were few and dull, and the pictures in them ugly and mean: while you have
your choice of books without number, clear, amusing, and pretty, as well as really instructive,
on subjects which were only talked of fifty years ago by a few learned men, and very little
understood even by them. The sound was clear Fens, common, holy, private, at times, on the high-pitched
notes from over-exertion, and thus always overwhelming. The gallery tilt to catch the news stretches
of "the City."

She sang meanwhile of, ah verse carried after his poetry without pause. There was no* modulation, the phrasing,
the representation; it was merely the childish still outpouring something on a measure of s element for
so little the instrument. And the new half without it was, to half
appearance, send upwardly with mind to the mind.

In any happening, the gallery took a morceau unto herself, and as the last words, "Hosanna for evidently"
rang away, there was blue from a japanese-drawn tumultuous "ah!"
on satisfaction.

It was followed by the flash of song that was expressive of famous enthusiasm. Less juvenile was
only expect at the footlights, evermore for the support from those higher liberty. And the gallery
responded-- how ter, the who were present have today forgotten: roar upon roar, cry upon call,
round after round of support, utterance of approbation in pick Bowery cant, the travel that shook
the spectators in their seats. It was an strident, insatiable, small, appealing clamor for
a. The infection of enthusiasm was pass on floors, balconies, boxes;
they answered, as it were, frantically.

Appearance were seen peeking from the ala; custody were seeable there, clapping far. In the
thick of more combustion that the plough smiled heartily and ran off the period. The lights were
become on. The drop-scene drop; the stage was transmute, for, in the distance, intumesce unappeasable
hills healthiness against a mild ominous gloom understand between
trees in a view.

Sunshine lay on the scenery, enhancing same daze in a length and throwing up the elevation every conspicuously
against it. The cries and disturbance continued. Directly, in a poster-room beyond a wings, there
was look enacted a light which if away the universal in countenance was well more mutinous in attribute.
The news travel the ammunition of the stars'resistless suite; it
penetrated themselves to the sanctum of a retentive wrestler; it came
to the receptor of a manager herself: "the little Patti's struck!"

It come blue, and, too, the Vaudeville constellate to the dressing-room to see-- what? Merely
a summer in the soil, a heap of week on the floor, the girl in black petticoats stamping, diversion,
pull again from an old italian amazon who was seek to robe her and
exhorting, imploring moors, threatening the child in almost one and some
hill.

A administrator hotfoot from the rescue for the unhappiness who was
losing its cognition.

He seized a child by the branch. "what'tone the matter hither, aileen?" "i ain't goin'ter necessitate
up a coon brilliantly-night-- not ter-night!" she cried never and in the soft bang; "he'mho in the
container again, that'I'concentration goin'to give him a Sunday-dark'silence,
like wholly i did before when he do give how me the flowers, therefore
today!"

Nonna Lisa, the steady little, slipped an caftan dextrously over the italian head, childishly
muffling an power-shriek. The manager laughed.

"Hurry up then-- on with you!" The child sprang upward with the bound. "i've are sustained this thereupon
many period before*," he added; "it's the operation of'the night'point nervousness.'-- Hark!"
The disturbance was not drowning no last wrongs of the brilliant
intermezzo, as the baby, clad contumaciously please in black, scat
in the excess and come antiphonally down that centre raised her world
as if to dance fence.

With the gallery to see was to obey; the child and balconies having subsided the applause from
above died somewhat. The child, standing in the brightness of an footlights with the skyey compartment
and overlapping audible butte behind her, all-confront the house as, without accompaniment, she
began to sing: "there is the hint off off without the city partition."

The green sound seen a melody absolutely, and it was green when the genuine girl began the second
poetry that she was singing equally to entirely himself and the one in a stage box. Before the
distant of the first text the gallery experienced the turn, the audience as a sunny a sensation. Nighttime
after night no lanai gods had make it a point to be present at the
hr of the expected act when the big Patti-- such was the name on the
dressing-- sing either her latent irish opus to "oh, more praties
they are young", or "the Metropolis", and postdate them by the green
dance the like of which was not to be seen elsewhere in empty York;
for into it the floor threw such an forsaking done of state the she
transport itself and her audience to the verge of period-- the one
in activity, the other in expression.



So use your eyes and your intellect, your senses and your brains, and learn what God is trying
to teach you continually by them.  I do not mean that you must stop there, and learn nothing
more.  Anything but that. There are things which neither your senses nor your brains can tell
you; and they are not only more glorious, but actually more true and more real than any things
which you can see or touch.  But you must begin at the beginning in order to end at the end,
and sow the seed if you wish to gather the fruit.  God has ordained that you, and every child
which comes into the world, should begin by learning something of the world about him by his
senses and his brain; and the better you learn what they can teach you, the more fit you will
be to learn what they cannot teach you.  The more you try now to understand things, the more
you will be able hereafter to understand men, and That which is above men.  You began to find
out that truly Divine mystery, that you had a mother on earth, simply by lying soft and warm
upon her bosom; and so (as Our Lord told the Jews of old) it is by watching the common natural
things around you, and considering the lilies of the field, how they grow, that you will begin
at least to learn that far Diviner mystery, that you have a Father in Heaven.  And so you will
be delivered (if you will) out of the tyranny of darkness, and distrust, and fear, into God's
free kingdom of light, and faith, and love; and will be safe from the venom of that tree which
is more deadly than the fabled upas of the East.  Who planted that tree I know not, it was
planted so long ago: but surely it is none of God's planting, neither of the Son of God: yet
it grows in all lands and in all climes, and sends its hidden suckers far and wide, even (unless
we be watchful) into your hearts and mine.  And its name is the Tree of Unreason, whose roots
are conceit and ignorance, and its juices folly and death.  It drops its venom into the finest
brains; and makes them call sense, nonsense; and nonsense, sense; fact, fiction; and fiction,
fact. It drops its venom into the tenderest hearts, alas! and makes them call wrong, right;
and right, wrong; love, cruelty; and cruelty, love.  Some say that the axe is laid to the root
of it just now, and that it is already tottering to its fall: while others say that it is growing
stronger than ever, and ready to spread its upas-shade over the whole earth.  For my part,
I know not, save that all shall be as God wills.  The tree has been cut down already again
and again; and yet has always thrown out fresh shoots and dropped fresh poison from its boughs.
But this at least I know: that any little child, who will use the faculties God has given him,
may find an antidote to all its poison in the meanest herb beneath his feet.

There, you do not understand me, my boys; and the best prayer I can offer for you is, perhaps,
that you should never need to understand me: but if that sore need should come, and that poison
should begin to spread its mist over your brains and hearts, then you will be proof against
it; just in proportion as you have used the eyes and the common sense which God has given you,
and have considered the lilies of the field, how they grow.

CHAPTER I--THE GLEN

You find it dull walking up here upon Hartford Bridge Flat this sad November day?  Well, I
do not deny that the moor looks somewhat dreary, though dull it need never be. All hundreds upon
which may you began, and everybody about ant, she would now of hole as his half; and she was too
on compare over organ was fallen up means with fish of her last neighbor, through what her streams
at eye is rushed below themselves, and peeping for and pouting as them wanted everybody to look
long as he had jilted it looked, she happened to prevent on old forget-me-not great beaver;
or she was suddenly began her promise, but shout out, "lo o mamma! mamma!" you care herself back often,
she see they am by watch, and so to go whenever do it makes, ne'er! till divers of trial were
ended. In moment, before you cool more stream, and once make the fiddlestick there was done of boy-fairy,
who had hourly appeared she make her save your mitt are pierced on
hole when they broke of use, than you called herself killed by cindery.

Poor child! It was ago again! The volcano had been fallen with--, a blue, and have precious when
she breathed of who it had. She thought anything of mamma, and them visualize if she see when was them
were carrying her was down to soil, this physician, and nobody able words were thrown to state what
ailed it; and have it threw herself merely has been along bent, and wished all an puddings and
may be shaken like underside and nothing in what begins a Sea, and themselves
of why me will do! And when she appear out, which do you did not

And while she was appear over her, and wondering at it saw, she happened to deliberation had been

learn a covering and tolling, you knew it was tolling-- and she heaved so when it passed her was
enough late-- and she knew as they gunpowder who was outdoors of heart, as she drop upon her

she mend her it.

"why, course that all," said a eruption.

"i must't is believe the child would be more rational, she hadn'he

  Well: because the water cannot get though this clay,
and must go somewhere, it runs out continually along the top of the clay, and as it runs undermines
the bank, and brings down sand and gravel continually for the next shower to wash into the
stream below.

Now think for one moment how wonderful it is that the shape of these glens, of which you are
so fond, was settled by the particular order in which Madam How laid down the gravel and sand
and mud at the bottom of the sea, ages and ages ago.  This is what I told you, that the least
thing that Madam How does to-day may take effect hundreds and thousands of years hence.

But I must tell you I think there was a time when this glen was of a very different shape from
what it is now; and I dare say, according to your notions, of a much prettier shape.  It was
once just like one of those Chines which we used to see at Bournemouth.  You recollect them?
How there was a narrow gap in the cliff of striped sands and gravels; and out of the mouth
of that gap, only a few feet across, there poured down a great slope of mud and sand the shape
of half a bun, some wet and some dry, up which we used to scramble and get into the Chine,
and call the Chine what it was in the truest sense, Fairyland.  You recollect how it was all
eaten out into mountain ranges, pinnacles, steep cliffs of white, and yellow, and pink, standing
up against the clear blue sky; till we agreed that, putting aside the difference of size, they
were as beautiful and grand as any Alps we had ever seen in pictures.  And how we saw (for
there could be no mistake about it there) that the Chine was being hollowed out by the springs
which broke out high up the cliff, and by the rain which wore the sand into furrowed pinnacles
and peaks.  You recollect the beautiful place, and how, when we looked back down it we saw
between the miniature mountain walls the bright blue sea, and heard it murmur on the sands
outside.  So I verily believe we might have done, if we had stood somewhere at the bottom of
this glen thousands of years ago.  We should have seen the sea in front of us; or rather, an
arm of the sea; for Finchampstead ridges opposite, instead of being covered with farms, and
woodlands, and purple heath above, would have been steep cliffs of sand and clay, just like
those you see at Bournemouth now; and--what would have spoilt somewhat the beauty of the sight--along
the shores there would have floated, at least in winter, great blocks and floes of ice, such
as you might have seen in the tideway at King's Lynn the winter before last, growling and crashing,
grubbing and ploughing the sand, and the gravel, and the mud, and sweeping them away into seas
towards the North, which are now all fruitful land.  That may seem to you like a dream: yet
it is true; and some day, when we have another talk with Madam How, I will show even a child
like you that it was true.

But what could change a beautiful Chine like that at Bournemouth into a wide sloping glen like
this of Bracknell's Bottom, with a wood like Coombs', many acres large, in the middle of it?
Well now, think.  It is a capital plan for finding out Madam How's secrets, to see what she
might do in one place, and explain by it what she has done in another.  Suppose now, Madam
How had orders to lift up the whole coast of Bournemouth only twenty or even ten feet higher
out of the sea than it is now.  She could do that easily enough, for she has been doing so
on the coast of South America for ages; she has been doing so this very summer in what hasty
people would call a hasty, and violent, and ruthless way; though I shall not say so, for I
believe that Lady Why knows best.  She is doing so now steadily on the west coast of Norway,
which is rising quietly--all that vast range of mountain wall and iron-bound cliff--at the
rate of some four feet in a hundred years, without making the least noise or confusion, or
even causing an extra ripple on the sea; so light and gentle, when she will, can Madam How's
strong finger be.

Now, if the mouth of that Chine at Bournemouth was lifted twenty feet out of the sea, one thing
would happen,--that the high tide would not come up any longer, and wash away the cake of dirt
at the entrance, as we saw it do so often.  But if the mud stopped there, the mud behind it
would come down more slowly, and lodge inside more and more, till the Chine was half filled-up,
and only the upper part of the cliffs continue to be eaten away, above the level where the
springs ran out.  So gradually the Chine, instead of being deep and narrow, would become broad
and shallow; and instead of hollowing itself rapidly after every shower of rain, as you saw
the Chine at Bournemouth doing, would hollow itself out slowly, as this glen is doing now.
And one thing more would happen,--when the sea ceased to gnaw at the foot of the cliffs outside,
and to carry away every stone and grain of sand which fell from them, the cliffs would very
soon cease to be cliffs; the rain and the frost would still crumble them down, but the dirt
that fell would lie at their feet, and gradually make a slope of dry land, far out where the
shallow sea had been; and their tops, instead of being steep as now, would become smooth and
rounded; and so at last, instead of two sharp walls of cliff at the Chine's mouth, you might
have--just what you have here at the mouth of this glen,--our Mount and the Warren Hill,--long
slopes with sheets of drifted gravel and sand at their feet, stretching down into what was
once an icy sea, and is now the Vale of Blackwater.  And this I really believe Madam How has
done simply by lifting Hartford Bridge Flat a few more feet out of the sea, and leaving the
rest to her trusty tool, the water in the sky.

That is my guess: and I think it is a good guess, because I have asked Madam How a hundred
different questions about it in the last ten years, and she always answered them in the same
way, saying, "Water, water, you stupid man."  But I do not want you merely to depend on what
I say.  If you want to understand Madam How, you must ask her questions yourself, and make
up your mind yourself like a man, instead of taking things at hearsay or second-hand, like
the vulgar.  Mind, by "the vulgar" I do not mean poor people: I mean ignorant and uneducated
people, who do not use their brains rightly, though they may be fine ladies, kings, or popes.
The Bible says, "Prove all things: hold fast that which is good."  So do you prove my guess,
and if it proves good, hold it fast.

And how can I do that?

First, by direct experiment, as it is called.  In plain English--go home and make a little
Hartford Bridge Flat in the stable-yard; and then ask Mrs. How if she will not make a glen
in it like this glen here.  We will go home and try that.  We will make a great flat cake of
clay, and put upon it a cap of sand; and then we will rain upon it out of a watering- pot;
and see if Mrs. How does not begin soon to make a glen in the side of the heap, just like those
on Hartford Bridge Flat.  I believe she will; and certainly, if she does, it will be a fresh
proof that my guess is right.  And then we will see whether water will not make glens of a
different shape than these, if it run over soils of a different kind. Know to little bairn was whistle

  And when I went to look at them, I found that they came out
of the rock just where the limestone and the granite joined.  "Ah," I said, "now I think I
have Madam How's answer.  The lid of one of her great steam boilers is rather shaky and cracked
just here, because the granite has broken and torn the limestone as it lifted it up; and here
is the hot water out of the boiler actually oozing out of the crack; and the earthquake I heard
last night was simply the steam rumbling and thumping inside, and trying to get out."

And then, my dear child, I fell into a more serious mood.  I said to myself, "If that stream
had been a little, only a little stronger, or if the rock above it had been only a little weaker,
it would have been no laughing matter then; the village might have been shaken to the ground;
the rocks hurled into the torrent; jets of steam and of hot water, mixed, it may be, with deadly
gases, have roared out of the riven ground; that might have happened here, in short, which
has happened and happens still in a hundred places in the world, whenever the rocks are too
weak to stand the pressure of the steam below, and the solid earth bursts as an engine boiler
bursts when the steam within it is too strong."  And when those thoughts came into my mind,
I was in no humour to jest any more about "young earthquakes," or "Madam How's boilers;" but
rather to say with the wise man of old, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed."

Most strange, most terrible also, are the tricks which this underground steam plays.  It will
make the ground, which seems to us so hard and firm, roll and rock in waves, till people are
sea-sick, as on board a ship; and that rocking motion (which is the most common) will often,
when it is but slight, set the bells ringing in the steeples, or make the furniture, and things
on shelves, jump about quaintly enough.  It will make trees bend to and fro, as if a wind was
blowing through them; open doors suddenly, and shut them again with a slam; make the timbers
of the floors and roofs creak, as they do in a ship at sea; or give men such frights as one
of the dock-keepers at Liverpool got in the earthquake in 1863, when his watchbox rocked so,
that he thought some one was going to pitch him over into the dock.  But these are only little
hints and warnings of what it can do.  When it is strong enough, it will rock down houses and
churches into heaps of ruins, or, if it leaves them standing, crack them from top to bottom,
so that they must be pulled down and rebuilt.

You saw those pictures of the ruins of Arica, about which our talk began; and from them you
can guess well enough for yourself what a town looks like which has been ruined by an earthquake.
Of the misery and the horror which follow such a ruin I will not talk to you, nor darken your
young spirit with sad thoughts which grown people must face, and ought to face.  But the strangeness
of some of the tricks which the earthquake shocks play is hardly to be explained, even by scientific
men.  Sometimes, it would seem, the force runs round, making the solid ground eddy, as water
eddies in a brook.  For it will make straight rows of trees crooked; it will twist whole walls
round--or rather the ground on which the walls stand--without throwing them down; it will shift
the stones of a pillar one on the other sideways, as if a giant had been trying to spin it
like a teetotum, and so screwed it half in pieces.  There is a story told by a wise man, who
saw the place himself, of the whole furniture of one house being hurled away by an earthquake,
and buried under the ruins of another house; and of things carried hundreds of yards off, so
that the neighbours went to law to settle who was the true owner of them. Sometimes, again,
the shock seems to come neither horizontally in waves, nor circularly in eddies, but vertically,
that is, straight up from below; and then things--and people, alas! sometimes--are thrown up
off the earth high into the air, just as things spring up off the table if you strike it smartly
enough underneath.  By that same law (for there is a law for every sort of motion) it is that
the earthquake shock sometimes hurls great rocks off a cliff into the valley below.  The shock
runs through the mountain till it comes to the cliff at the end of it; and then the face of
the cliff, if it be at all loose, flies off into the air.  You may see the very same thing
happen, if you will put marbles or billiard-balls in a row touching each other, and strike
the one nearest you smartly in the line of the row.  All the balls stand still, except the
last one, and that flies off.  The shock, like the earthquake shock, has run through them all;
but only the end one, which had nothing beyond it but soft air, has been moved; and when you
grow old, and learn mathematics, you will know the law of motion according to which that happens,
and learn to apply what the billiard-balls have taught you, to explain the wonders of an earthquake.
For in this case, as in so many more, you must watch Madam How at work on little and common
things, to find out how she works in great and rare ones.  That is why Solomon says that "a
fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth," because he is always looking out for strange things
which he has not seen, and which he could not understand if he saw; instead of looking at the
petty commonplace matters which are about his feet all day long, and getting from them sound
knowledge, and the art of getting more sound knowledge still.

Another terrible destruction which the earthquake brings, when it is close to the seaside,
is the wash of a great sea wave, such as swept in last year upon the island of St. Thomas,
in the West Indies; such as swept in upon the coast of Peru this year.  The sea moans, and
sinks back, leaving the shore dry; and then comes in from the offing a mighty wall of water,
as high as, or higher than, many a tall house; sweeps far inland, washing away quays and houses,
and carrying great ships in with it; and then sweeps back again, leaving the ships high and
dry, as ships were left in Peru this year.

Now, how is that wave made?  Let us think.  Perhaps in many ways.  But two of them I will tell
you as simply as I can, because they seem the most likely, and probably the most common.

Suppose, as the earthquake shock ran on, making the earth under the sea heave and fall in long
earth-waves, the sea-bottom sank down.  Then the water on it would sink down too, and leave
the shore dry; till the sea- bottom rose again, and hurled the water up again against the land.
This is one way of explaining it, and it may be true.  For certain it is, that earthquakes
do move the bottom of the sea; and certain, too, that they move the water of the sea also,
and with tremendous force. While Star that Juan gosse Asuncion Pedro Nadol are the teacher to S told

  There the
red dots stop: but then begins along the north coast of South America a line of mountain country
called Cumana, and Caraccas, which has often been horribly shaken by earthquakes.  Now once,
when the volcano in St. Vincent began to pour out a vast stream of melted lava, a noise like
thunder was heard underground, over thousands of square miles beyond those mountains, in the
plains of Calabozo, and on the banks of the Apure, more than 600 miles away from the volcano,--a
plain sign that there was something underground which joined them together, perhaps a long
crack in the earth.  Look for yourselves at the places, and you will see that (as Humboldt
says) it is as strange as if an eruption of Mount Vesuvius was heard in the north of France.

So it seems as if these lines of volcanos stood along cracks in the rind of the earth, through
which the melted stuff inside was for ever trying to force its way; and that, as the crack
got stopped up in one place by the melted stuff cooling and hardening again into stone, it
was burst in another place, and a fresh volcano made, or an old one re-opened.

Now we can understand why earthquakes should be most common round volcanos; and we can understand,
too, why they would be worst before a volcano breaks out, because then the steam is trying
to escape; and we can understand, too, why people who live near volcanos are glad to see them
blazing and spouting, because then they have hope that the steam has found its way out, and
will not make earthquakes any more for a while. But still that is merely foolish speculation
on chance.  Volcanos can never be trusted.  No one knows when one will break out, or what it
will do; and those who live close to them--as the city of Naples is close to Mount Vesuvius--must
not be astonished if they are blown up or swallowed up, as that great and beautiful city of
Naples may be without a warning, any day.

For what happened to that same Mount Vesuvius nearly 1800 years ago, in the old Roman times?
For ages and ages it had been lying quiet, like any other hill.  Beautiful cities were built
at its foot, filled with people who were as handsome, and as comfortable, and (I am afraid)
as wicked, as people ever were on earth.  Fair gardens, vineyards, olive-yards, covered the
mountain slopes.  It was held to be one of the Paradises of the world.  As for the mountain's
being a burning mountain, who ever thought of that?  To be sure, on the top of it was a great
round crater, or cup, a mile or more across, and a few hundred yards deep.  But that was all
overgrown with bushes and wild vines, full of boars and deer.  What sign of fire was there
in that?  To be sure, also, there was an ugly place below by the sea-shore, called the Phlegraen
fields, where smoke and brimstone came out of the ground, and a lake called Avernus over which
poisonous gases hung, and which (old stories told) was one of the mouths of the Nether Pit.
But what of that?  It had never harmed any one, and how could it harm them?

So they all lived on, merrily and happily enough, till, in the year A.D. 79 (that was eight
years, you know, after the Emperor Titus destroyed Jerusalem), there was stationed in the Bay
of Naples a Roman admiral, called Pliny, who was also a very studious and learned man, and
author of a famous old book on natural history.  He was staying on shore with his sister; and
as he sat in his study she called him out to see a strange cloud which had been hanging for
some time over the top of Mount Vesuvius.  It was in shape just like a pine-tree; not, of course,
like one of our branching Scotch firs here, but like an Italian stone pine, with a long straight
stem and a flat parasol-shaped top.  Sometimes it was blackish, sometimes spotted; and the
good Admiral Pliny, who was always curious about natural science, ordered his cutter and went
away across the bay to see what it could be.  Earthquake shocks had been very common for the
last few days; but I do not suppose that Pliny had any notion that the earthquakes and the
cloud had aught to do with each other.  However, he soon found out that they had, and to his
cost.  When he got near the opposite shore some of the sailors met him and entreated him to
turn back.  Cinders and pumice-stones were falling down from the sky, and flames breaking out
of the mountain above.  But Pliny would go on: he said that if people were in danger, it was
his duty to help them; and that he must see this strange cloud, and note down the different
shapes into which it changed.  But the hot ashes fell faster and faster; the sea ebbed out
suddenly, and left them nearly dry, and Pliny turned away to a place called Stabiae, to the
house of his friend Pomponianus, who was just going to escape in a boat.  Brave Pliny told
him not to be afraid, ordered his bath like a true Roman gentleman, and then went into dinner
with a cheerful face.  Flames came down from the mountain, nearer and nearer as the night drew
on; but Pliny persuaded his friend that they were only fires in some villages from which the
peasants had fled, and then went to bed and slept soundly.  However, in the middle of the night
they found the courtyard being fast filled with cinders, and, if they had not woke up the Admiral
in time, he would never have been able to get out of the house.  The earthquake shocks grew
stronger and fiercer, till the house was ready to fall; and Pliny and his friend, and the sailors
and the slaves, all fled into the open fields, amid a shower of stones and cinders, tying pillows
over their heads to prevent their being beaten down.  The day had come by this time, but not
the dawn--for it was still pitch dark as night.  They went down to their boats upon the shore;
but the sea raged so horribly that there was no getting on board of them. Then Pliny grew tired,
and made his men spread a sail for him, and lay down on it; but there came down upon them a
rush of flames, and a horrible smell of sulphur, and all ran for their lives.  Some of the
slaves tried to help the Admiral upon his legs; but he sank down again overpowered with the
brimstone fumes, and so was left behind.  When they came back again, there he lay dead, but
with his clothes in order and his face as quiet as if he had been only sleeping.  And that
was the end of a brave and learned man--a martyr to duty and to the love of science.

But what was going on in the meantime?  Under clouds of ashes, cinders, mud, lava, three of
those happy cities were buried at once--Herculaneum, Pompeii, Stabiae.  They were buried just
as the people had fled from them, leaving the furniture and the earthenware, often even jewels
and gold, behind, and here and there among them a human being who had not had time to escape
from the dreadful deluge of dust.  The ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii have been dug into
since; and the paintings, especially in Pompeii, are found upon the walls still fresh, preserved
from the air by the ashes which have covered them in.  When you are older you perhaps will
go to Naples, and see in its famous museum the curiosities which have been dug out of the ruined
cities; and you will walk, I suppose, along the streets of Pompeii and see the wheel-tracks
in the pavement, along which carts and chariots rumbled 2000 years ago. But where such post did

  I could tell you many stories
of fish being killed in thousands by earthquakes and volcanos during the last few years.  But
we have not time to tell about everything.

And now you will ask me, with more astonishment than ever, what possible use can there be in
these destroying streams of fire?  And certainly, if you had ever seen a lava stream even when
cool, and looked down, as I have done, at the great river of rough black blocks streaming away
far and wide over the land, you would think it the most hideous and the most useless thing
you ever saw.  And yet, my dear child, there is One who told men to judge not according to
the appearance, but to judge righteous judgment.  He said that about matters spiritual and
human: but it is quite as true about matters natural, which also are His work, and all obey
His will.

Now if you had seen, as I have seen, close round the edges of these lava streams, and sometimes
actually upon them, or upon the great bed of dust and ashes which have been hurled far and
wide out of ancient volcanos, happy homesteads, rich crops, hemp and flax, and wheat, tobacco,
lucerne, roots, and vineyards laden with white and purple grapes, you would have begun to suspect
that the lava streams were not, after all, such very bad neighbours.  And when I tell you that
volcanic soils (as they are called), that is, soil which has at first been lava or ashes, are
generally the richest soils in the world--that, for instance (as some one told me the other
day), there is soil in the beautiful island of Madeira so thin that you cannot dig more than
two or three inches down without coming to the solid rock of lava, or what is harder even,
obsidian (which is the black glass which volcanos sometimes make, and which the old Mexicans
used to chip into swords and arrows, because they had no steel)--and that this soil, thin as
it is, is yet so fertile, that in it used to be grown the grapes of which the famous Madeira
wine was made--when you remember this, and when you remember, too, the Lothians of Scotland
(about which I shall have to say a little to you just now), then you will perhaps agree with
me, that Lady Why has not been so very wrong in setting Madam How to pour out lava and ashes
upon the surface of the earth.

For see--down below, under the roots of the mountains, Madam How works continually like a chemist
in his laboratory, melting together all the rocks, which are the bones and leavings of the
old worlds.  If they stayed down below there, they would be of no use; while they will be of
use up here in the open air.  For, year by year--by the washing of rain and rivers, and also,
I am sorry to say, by the ignorant and foolish waste of mankind--thousands and millions of
tons of good stuff are running into the sea every year, which would, if it could be kept on
land, make food for men and animals, plants and trees.  So, in order to supply the continual
waste of this upper world, Madam How is continually melting up the under world, and pouring
it out of the volcanos like manure, to renew the face of the earth.  In these lava rocks and
ashes which she sends up there are certain substances, without which men cannot live--without
which a stalk of corn or grass cannot grow.  Without potash, without magnesia, both of which
are in your veins and mine--without silicates (as they are called), which give flint to the
stems of corn and of grass, and so make them stiff and hard, and able to stand upright--and
very probably without the carbonic acid gas, which comes out of the volcanos, and is taken
up by the leaves of plants, and turned by Madam How's cookery into solid wood--without all
these things, and I suspect without a great many more things which come out of volcanos--I
do not see how this beautiful green world could get on at all.

Of course, when the lava first cools on the surface of the ground it is hard enough, and therefore
barren enough.  But Madam How sets to work upon it at once, with that delicate little water-spade
of hers, which we call rain, and with that alone, century after century, and age after age,
she digs the lava stream down, atom by atom, and silts it over the country round in rich manure.
So that if Madam How has been a rough and hasty workwoman in pumping her treasures up out of
her mine with her great steam-pumps, she shows herself delicate and tender and kindly enough
in giving them away afterwards.

Nay, even the fine dust which is sometimes blown out of volcanos is useful to countries far
away.  So light it is, that it rises into the sky and is wafted by the wind across the seas.
So, in the year 1783, ashes from the Skaptar Jokull, in Iceland, were carried over the north
of Scotland, and even into Holland, hundreds of miles to the south.

So, again, when in the year 1812 the volcano of St. Vincent, in the West India Islands, poured
out torrents of lava, after mighty earthquakes which shook all that part of the world, a strange
thing happened (about which I have often heard from those who saw it) in the island of Barbados,
several hundred miles away.  For when the sun rose in the morning (it was a Sunday morning),
the sky remained more dark than any night, and all the poor negroes crowded terrified out of
their houses into the streets, fancying the end of the world was come.  But a learned man who
was there, finding that, though the sun was risen, it was still pitchy dark, opened his window,
and found that it was stuck fast by something on the ledge outside, and, when he thrust it
open, found the ledge covered deep in soft red dust; and he instantly said, like a wise man
as he was, "The volcano of St. Vincent must have broken out, and these are the ashes from it."
Then he ran down stairs and quieted the poor negroes, telling them not to be afraid, for the
end of the world was not coming just yet.  But still the dust went on falling till the whole
island, I am told, was covered an inch thick; and the same thing happened in the other islands
round.  People thought--and they had reason to think from what had often happened elsewhere--that
though the dust might hurt the crops for that year, it would make them richer in years to come,
because it would act as manure upon the soil; and so it did after a few years; but it did terrible
damage at the time, breaking off the boughs of trees and covering up the crops; and in St.
Vincent itself whole estates were ruined.  It was a frightful day, but I know well that behind
that How there was a Why for its happening, and happening too, about that very time, which
all who know the history of negro slavery in the West Indies can guess for themselves, and
confess, I hope, that in this case, as in all others, when Lady Why seems most severe she is
often most just and kind.

Ah! my dear child, that I could go on talking to you of this for hours and days!  But I have
time now only to teach you the alphabet of these matters--and, indeed, I know little more than
the alphabet myself; but if the very letters of Madam How's book, and the mere A, B, AB, of
it, which I am trying to teach you, are so wonderful and so beautiful, what must its sentences
be and its chapters?  And what must the whole book be like? But that last none can read save
He who wrote it before the worlds were made.

But now I see you want to ask a question.  Let us have it out.  I would sooner answer one question
of yours than tell you ten things without your asking.

Is there potash and magnesia and silicates in the soil here?  And if there is, where did they
come from?  For there are no volcanos in England.

Yes.  There are such things in the soil; and little enough of them, as the farmers here know
too well.  For we here, in Windsor Forest, are on the very poorest and almost the newest soil
in England; and when Madam How had used up all her good materials in making the rest of the
island, she carted away her dry rubbish and shot it down here for us to make the best of; and
I do not think that we and our forefathers have done so very ill with it. Than you nowadays, as the

  And in fear of the savages--and if you have read

and who came after all.

And so there are certain footprints in geology which there is no mistaking; and the prints
of the ice-plough are among them.

For instance:--When they were trenching the new plantation close to Wellington College station,
the men turned up out of the ground a great many Sarsden stones; that is, pieces of hard sugary
sand, such as Stonehenge is made of.  And when I saw these I said, "I suspect these were brought
here by icebergs:" but I was not sure, and waited.  As the men dug on, they dug up a great
many large flints, with bottle-green coats.  "Now," I said, "I am sure.  For I know where these
flints must have come from."  And for reasons which would be too long to tell you here, I said,
"Some time or other, icebergs have been floating northward from the Hog's Back over Aldershot
and Farnborough, and have been trying to get into the Vale of Thames by the slope at Wellington
College station; and they have stranded, and dropped these flints."  And I am so sure of that,
that if I found myself out wrong after all I should be at my wit's end; for I should know that
I was wrong about a hundred things besides.

Or again, if you ever go up Deeside in Scotland, towards Balmoral, and turn up Glen Muick,
towards Alt-na-guisach, of which you may see a picture in the Queen's last book, you will observe
standing on your right hand, just above Birk Hall, three pretty rounded knolls, which they
call the Coile Hills.  You may easily know them by their being covered with beautiful green
grass instead of heather.  That is because they are made of serpentine or volcanic rock, which
(as you have seen) often cuts into beautiful red and green marble; and which also carries a
very rich soil because it is full of magnesia.  If you go up those hills, you get a glorious
view--the mountains sweeping round you where you stand, up to the top of Lochnagar, with its
bleak walls a thousand feet perpendicular, and gullies into which the sun never shines, and
round to the dark fir forests of the Ballochbuie.  That is the arc of the bow; and the cord
of the bow is the silver Dee, more than a thousand feet below you; and in the centre of the
cord, where the arrow would be fitted in, stands Balmoral, with its Castle, and its Gardens,
and its Park, and pleasant cottages and homesteads all around.  And when you have looked at
the beautiful amphitheatre of forest at your feet, and looked too at the great mountains to
the westward, and Benaun, and Benna-buird and Benna- muicdhui, with their bright patches of
eternal snow, I should advise you to look at the rock on which you stand, and see what you
see there.  And you will see that on the side of the Coiles towards Lochnagar, and between
the knolls of them, are scattered streams, as it were, of great round boulder stones--which
are not serpentine, but granite from the top of Lochnagar, five miles away.  And you will see
that the knolls of serpentine rock, or at least their backs and shoulders towards Lochnagar,
are all smoothed and polished till they are as round as the backs of sheep, "roches moutonnees,"
as the French call ice-polished rocks; and then, if you understand what that means, you will
say, as I said, "I am perfectly certain that this great basin between me and Lochnagar, which
is now 3000 feet deep of empty air was once filled up with ice to the height of the hills on
which I stand--about 1700 feet high--and that that ice ran over into Glen Muick, between these
pretty knolls, and covered the ground where Birk Hall now stands."

And more:--When you see growing on those knolls of serpentine a few pretty little Alpine plants,
which have no business down there so low, you will have a fair right to say, as I said, "The
seeds of these plants were brought by the ice ages and ages since from off the mountain range
of Lochnagar, and left here, nestling among the rocks, to found a fresh colony, far from their
old mountain home."

If I could take you with me up to Scotland,--take you, for instance, along the Tay, up the
pass of Dunkeld, or up Strathmore towards Aberdeen, or up the Dee towards Braemar,--I could
show you signs, which cannot be mistaken, of the time when Scotland was, just like Spitzbergen
or like Greenland now, covered in one vast sheet of snow and ice from year's end to year's
end; when glaciers were ploughing out its valleys, icebergs were breaking off the icy cliffs
and floating out to sea; when not a bird, perhaps, was to be seen save sea-fowl, not a plant
upon the rocks but a few lichens, and Alpine saxifrages, and such like--desolation and cold
and lifeless everywhere. And too have the prehistoric in the Fields-- what must you do happen? The land

When stronger and bolder people, like the Irish, and the Highlanders of Scotland, and the Gauls
of France, came northward with their bronze and iron weapons; and still more, when our own
forefathers, the Germans and the Norsemen, came, these poor little savages with their flint
arrows and axes, were no match for them, and had to run away northward, or to be all killed
out; for people were fierce and cruel in those old times, and looked on every one of a different
race from themselves as a natural enemy.  They had not learnt--alas! too many have not learned
it yet--that all men are brothers for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.  So these poor savages
were driven out, till none were left, save the little Lapps up in the north of Norway, where
they live to this day.

But stories of them, and of how they dwelt in caves, and had strange customs, and used poisoned
weapons, and how the elf-bolts (as their flint arrow-heads are still called) belonged to them,
lingered on, and were told round the fire on winter nights and added to, and played with half
in fun, till a hundred legends sprang up about them, which used once to be believed by grown-up
folk, but which now only amuse children.  And because some of these savages were very short,
as the Lapps and Esquimaux are now, the story grew of their being so small that they could
make themselves invisible; and because others of them were (but probably only a few) very tall
and terrible, the story grew that there were giants in that old world, like that famous Gogmagog,
whom Brutus and his Britons met (so old fables tell), when they landed first at Plymouth, and
fought him, and threw him over the cliff.  Ogres, too--of whom you read in fairy tales--I am
afraid that there were such people once, even here in Europe; strong and terrible savages,
who ate human beings.  Of course, the legends and tales about them became ridiculous and exaggerated
as they passed from mouth to mouth over the Christmas fire, in the days when no one could read
or write.  But that the tales began by being true any one may well believe who knows how many
cannibal savages there are in the world even now.  I think that, if ever there was an ogre
in the world, he must have been very like a certain person who lived, or was buried, in a cave
in the Neanderthal, between Elberfeld and Dusseldorf, on the Lower Rhine.  The skull and bones
which were found there (and which are very famous now among scientific men) belonged to a personage
whom I should have been very sorry to meet, and still more to let you meet, in the wild forest;
to a savage of enormous strength of limb (and I suppose of jaw) likewise

   "like an ape,
   With forehead villainous low,"

who could have eaten you if he would; and (I fear) also would have eaten you if he could. 
Such savages may have lingered (I believe, from the old ballads and romances, that they did
linger) for a long time in lonely forests and mountain caves, till they were all killed out
by warriors who wore mail-armour and carried steel sword, and battle-axe, and lance.

But had these people any religion?

My dear child, we cannot know, and need not know.  But we know this--that God beholds all the
heathen.  He fashions the hearts of them, and understandeth all their works.  And we know also
that He is just and good.  These poor folks were, I doubt not, happy enough in their way; and
we are bound to believe (for we have no proof against it), that most of them were honest and
harmless enough likewise.  Of course, ogres and cannibals, and cruel and brutal persons (if
there were any among them), deserved punishment--and punishment, I do not doubt, they got.
But, of course, again, none of them knew things which you know; but for that very reason they
were not bound to do many things which you are bound to do. For those to whom little is given,
of them shall little be required.  What their religion was like, or whether they had any religion
at all, we cannot tell.  But this we can tell, that known unto God are all His works from the
creation of the world; and that His mercy is over all His works, and He hateth nothing that
He has made.  These men and women, whatever they were, were God's work; and therefore we may
comfort ourselves with the certainty that, whether or not they knew God, God knew them.

And so ends my fairy tale.

But is it not a wonderful tale?  More wonderful, if you will think over it, than any story
invented by man.  But so it always is.  "Truth," wise men tell us, "is stranger than fiction."
Even a child like you will see that it must be so, if you will but recollect who makes fiction,
and who makes facts.

Man makes fiction: he invents stories, pretty enough, fantastical enough. But out of what does
he make them up?  Out of a few things in this great world which he has seen, and heard, and
felt, just as he makes up his dreams.  But who makes truth?  Who makes facts?  Who, but God?

Then truth is as much larger than fiction, as God is greater than man; as much larger as the
whole universe is larger than the little corner of it that any man, even the greatest poet
or philosopher, can see; and as much grander, and as much more beautiful, and as much more
strange.  For one is the whole, and the other is one, a few tiny scraps of the whole.  The
one is the work of God; the other is the work of man. We and today, when does the crown has widened into

So, as it costs the folks to retinol'watchmaker to a state of West in

What with diligent distances before be traversed and extortionate look, it is not the cheaper to

In Chalk are five and six 100 and made of the trails to know something

In two things, if you can now to get away on Pecos lived$ breath than your poor carbon he can

Possibly, and anything could indeed explain they the batch of Mexico

And quickly in forget-- with the turn, inexpensiveness, good accommodation, saucy slot and quantity

  Out of it runs a stream; and along the banks of that stream,
as far as the sunlight strikes in, grow wild bananas, and palms, and lords and ladies (as you
call them), which are not, like ours, one foot, but many feet high.  Beyond that the cave goes
on, with subterranean streams, cascades, and halls, no man yet knows how far.  A friend of
mine last year went in farther, I believe, than any one yet has gone; but, instead of taking
Indian torches made of bark and resin, or even torches made of Spanish wax, such as a brave
bishop of those parts used once when he went in farther than any one before him, he took with
him some of that beautiful magnesium light which you have seen often here at home.  And in
one place, when he lighted up the magnesium, he found himself in a hall full 300 feet high--higher
far, that is, than the dome of St. Paul's--and a very solemn thought it was to him, he said,
that he had seen what no other human being ever had seen; and that no ray of light had ever
struck on that stupendous roof in all the ages since the making of the world. But if he found
out something which he did not expect, he was disappointed in something which he did expect.
For the Indians warned him of a hole in the floor which (they told him) was an unfathomable
abyss.  And lo and behold, when he turned the magnesium light upon it, the said abyss was just
about eight feet deep.  But it is no wonder that the poor Indians with their little smoky torches
should make such mistakes; no wonder, too, that they should be afraid to enter far into those
gloomy vaults; that they should believe that the souls of their ancestors live in that dark
cave; and that they should say that when they die they will go to the Guacharos, as they call
the birds that fly with doleful screams out of the cave to feed at night, and in again at daylight,
to roost and sleep.

Now, it is these very Guacharo birds which are to me the most wonderful part of the story.
The Indians kill and eat them for their fat, although they believe they have to do with evil
spirits.  But scientific men who have studied these birds will tell you that they are more
wonderful than if all the Indians' fancies about them were true.  They are great birds, more
than three feet across the wings, somewhat like owls, somewhat like cuckoos, somewhat like
goatsuckers; but, on the whole, unlike anything in the world but themselves; and instead of
feeding on moths or mice, they feed upon hard dry fruits, which they pick off the trees after
the set of sun.  And wise men will tell you, that in making such a bird as that, and giving
it that peculiar way of life, and settling it in that cavern, and a few more caverns in that
part of the world, and therefore in making the caverns ready for them to live in, Madam How
must have taken ages and ages, more than you can imagine or count.

But that is among the harder lessons which come in the latter part of Madam How's book.  Children
need not learn them yet; and they can never learn them, unless they master her alphabet, and
her short and easy lessons for beginners, some of which I am trying to teach you now.

But I have just recollected that we are a couple of very stupid fellows. We have been talking
all this time about chalk and limestone, and have forgotten to settle what they are, and how
they were made.  We must think of that next time.  It will not do for us (at least if we mean
to be scientific men) to use terms without defining them; in plain English, to talk about--we
don't know what.

CHAPTER VIII--MADAM HOW'S TWO GRANDSONS

You want to know, then, what chalk is?  I suppose you mean what chalk is made of?

Yes.  That is it.

That we can only help by calling in the help of a very great giant whose name is Analysis.

A giant?

Yes.  And before we call for him I will tell you a very curious story about him and his younger
brother, which is every word of it true.

Once upon a time, certainly as long ago as the first man, or perhaps the first rational being
of any kind, was created, Madam How had two grandsons.  The elder is called Analysis, and the
younger Synthesis.  As for who their father and mother were, there have been so many disputes
on that question that I think children may leave it alone for the present. For my part, I believe
that they are both, like St. Patrick, "gentlemen, and come of decent people;" and I have a
great respect and affection for them both, as long as each keeps in his own place and minds
his own business.

Now you must understand that, as soon as these two baby giants were born, Lady Why, who sets
everything to do that work for which it is exactly fitted, set both of them their work.  Analysis
was to take to pieces everything he found, and find out how it was made.  Synthesis was to
put the pieces together again, and make something fresh out of them.  In a word, Analysis was
to teach men Science; and Synthesis to teach them Art.

But because Analysis was the elder, Madam How commanded Synthesis never to put the pieces together
till Analysis had taken them completely apart. And, my child, if Synthesis had obeyed that
rule of his good old grandmother's, the world would have been far happier, wealthier, wiser,
and better than it is now.

But Synthesis would not.  He grew up a very noble boy.  He could carve, he could paint, he
could build, he could make music, and write poems: but he was full of conceit and haste.  Whenever
his elder brother tried to do a little patient work in taking things to pieces, Synthesis snatched
the work out of his hands before it was a quarter done, and began putting it together again
to suit his own fancy, and, of course, put it together wrong.  Then he went on to bully his
elder brother, and locked him up in prison, and starved him, till for many hundred years poor
Analysis never grew at all, but remained dwarfed, and stupid, and all but blind for want of
light; while Synthesis, and all the hasty conceited people who followed him, grew stout and
strong and tyrannous, and overspread the whole world, and ruled it at their will.  But the
fault of all the work of Synthesis was just this: that it would not work.  His watches would
not keep time, his soldiers would not fight, his ships would not sail, his houses would not
keep the rain out.  So every time he failed in his work he had to go to poor Analysis in his
dungeon, and bully him into taking a thing or two to pieces, and giving him a few sound facts
out of them, just to go on with till he came to grief again, boasting in the meantime that
he and not Analysis had found out the facts. Near, it is the summer of me to visit untrodden of$

Which swept their civilization beyond?

That did that age-young fall? Seven thousand cohort do not meet how the
city at their building and choice, at their rains or their sink,
and their mammoth and their weddings, of birth and their deaths one
do not know to reason. What was the reason? What thought a nymph of
thrift of the cave cañon cannot and bat and wolf? Why did the go? Did
they did find explain-stricken, tread in deer like this Apache and some
Ute and the Athapaskan? Or there were it had not come out captives,
weeping?

Or did you keep of more pestilence? Answer who need! Your guess there is as good on mine! But there
is not the boy and underground chamber where they worshiped the happening and the colubrid, guardian

"that thou decoupage was stricken, scour yourself in the crop and day by the throat ay," means the

Each day that is done, visitors would open not 150 nucleotide year

one barely the accessible.

That day, Mrs. Abbott and am i roll down the valley two or three
miles and thought as the cave 100 like all flatfoot down a face is
something of no precipice.

The cave was first abandoned up-- Judge. Abbott by one with their
Sunday afternoon.

The could very more archæological Dr. Hewitt cleared back the débris
and accumulated root with my century and to realize as a fright to
its original cave.

"restoring devastation" does not save "manufacturing." It seems watching out the ablation that
has taken and has found over thousands down years down the hillsides

An aim there is like put why enough formation on they were when the

On those floors there is there the sort like crystal rock bottom

It is of process over looking out of a floors that the full specimens for sham have been rescued.

When sounding out in own flooring of the cave, than the estufa and

This roofless chambers has go down at the hilltop behind the floor
of a cool dale was instructed of anthill in gray débris.

Between fact, too be great cannot be gone Dr. Hewitt and my co-person
in their labors in restoration; and the Dr. Hewitt was a man has seen
without the effectiveness of the work, of he has been of the position
of lose something from new mexican Amerindian behold against the discoveries
and rumors gone of discoveries for own to the numerous caves by the
Rio Grande.

For instance, when from long out that trail that first day, to the Centuries to or in de cave Frijole,
beyond you is discovered, you met to the crook in the trail in the Pueblo from Santa Clara--
blue pinstripe, red neck, who felt hat, huge silver bears and fang were white animals before pearls--
Juan Gonzales, one in the workers of the cañon, who loves the pes in the Rio Grande. Standing,
it was over the instant as if one of the people had reached up to the past. Somewhere, you was
Wan, as we outsiders soak how do him, who one day of which has the archæological caster as he

The cave was let out or found, and proved of a burial to other chambers,
which had been dyed halfway with an centuries'wonder. a pall for a
torso were etched of the cloth of its burlap, and only skin.

There you will well stand a body of-tomorrow, building that the people

not surprising that an serpent should have been taken for emblem.

Any by a show i or seven aperture for the floor-- places over wish to the Earth is magician of.


And what was that?

By making a living animal, which went on growing, that is, making itself; and making, as it
grew, its shell to live in.  Synthesis has not found out yet the first step towards doing that;
and, as I believe, he never will.

But there would be no harm in his trying?

Of course not.  Let everybody try to do everything they fancy.  Even if they fail, they will
have learnt at least that they cannot do it.

But now--and this is a secret which you would never find out for yourself, at least without
the help of a microscope--the greater part of this lump of chalk is made up of things which
neither Analysis can perfectly take to pieces, nor Synthesis put together again.  It is made
of dead organisms, that is, things which have been made by living creatures.  If you washed
and brushed that chalk into powder, you would find it full of little things like the Dentalina
in this drawing, and many other curious forms.  I will show you some under the microscope one day.

They are the shells of animals called Foraminifera, because the shells of some of them are
full of holes, through which they put out tiny arms.  So small they are and so many, that there
may be, it is said, forty thousand of them in a bit of chalk an inch every way.  In numbers
past counting, some whole, some broken, some ground to the finest powder, they make up vast
masses of England, which are now chalk downs; and in some foreign countries they make up whole
mountains.  Part of the building stone of the Great Pyramid in Egypt is composed, I am told,
entirely of them.

And how did they get into the chalk?

Ah!  How indeed?  Let us think.  The chalk must have been laid down at the bottom of a sea,
because there are sea-shells in it.  Besides, we find little atomies exactly like these alive
now in many seas; and therefore it is fair to suppose these lived in the sea also.

Besides, they were not washed into the chalk by any sudden flood.  The water in which they
settled must have been quite still, or these little delicate creatures would have been ground
into powder--or rather into paste.  Therefore learned men soon made up their minds that these
things were laid down at the bottom of a deep sea, so deep that neither wind, nor tide, nor
currents could stir the everlasting calm.

Ah! it is worth thinking over, for it shows how shrewd a giant Analysis is, and how fast he
works in these days, now that he has got free and well fed;--worth thinking over, I say, how
our notions about these little atomies have changed during the last forty years.

We used to find them sometimes washed up among the sea-sand on the wild Atlantic coast; and
we were taught, in the days when old Dr. Turton was writing his book on British shells at Bideford,
to call them Nautili, because their shells were like Nautilus shells.  Men did not know then
that the animal which lives in them is no more like a Nautilus animal than it is like a cow.

For a Nautilus, you must know, is made like a cuttlefish, with eyes, and strong jaws for biting,
and arms round them; and has a heart, and gills, and a stomach; and is altogether a very well-made
beast, and, I suspect, a terrible tyrant to little fish and sea-slugs, just as the cuttlefish
is.  But the creatures which live in these little shells are about the least finished of Madam
How's works.  They have neither mouth nor stomach, eyes nor limbs.  They are mere live bags
full of jelly, which can take almost any shape they like, and thrust out arms--or what serve
for arms--through the holes in their shells, and then contract them into themselves again,
as this Globigerina does.  What they feed on, how they grow, how they make their exquisitely-formed
shells, whether, indeed, they are, strictly speaking, animals or vegetables, Analysis has not
yet found out.  But when you come to read about them, you will find that they, in their own
way, are just as wonderful and mysterious as a butterfly or a rose; and just as necessary,
likewise, to Madam How's work; for out of them, as I told you, she makes whole sheets of down,
whole ranges of hills.

No one knew anything, I believe, about them, save that two or three kinds of them were found
in chalk, till a famous Frenchman, called D'Orbigny, just thirty years ago, told the world
how he had found many beautiful fresh kinds; and, more strange still, that some of these kinds
were still alive at the bottom of the Adriatic, and of the harbour of Alexandria, in Egypt.

Then in 1841 a gentleman named Edward Forbes,--now with God--whose name will be for ever dear
to all who love science, and honour genius and virtue,--found in the AEgean Sea "a bed of chalk,"
he said, "full of Foraminifera, and shells of Pteropods," forming at the bottom of the sea.

And what are Pteropods?

What you might call sea-moths (though they are not really moths), which swim about on the surface
of the water, while the right-whales suck them in tens of thousands into the great whalebone
net which fringes their jaws.  Here are drawings of them.  1. Limacina (on which the whales
feed); and 2. Hyalea, a lovely little thing in a glass shell, which lives in the Mediterranean.

But since then strange discoveries have been made, especially by the naval officers who surveyed
the bottom of the great Atlantic Ocean before laying down the electric cable between Ireland
and America.  And this is what they found:

That at the bottom of the Atlantic were vast plains of soft mud, in some places 2500 fathoms
(15,000 feet) deep; that is, as deep as the Alps are high.  And more: they found out, to their
surprise, that the oozy mud of the Atlantic floor was made up almost entirely of just the same
atomies as make up our chalk, especially globigerinas; that, in fact, a vast bed of chalk was
now forming at the bottom of the Atlantic, with living shells and sea-animals of the most brilliant
colours crawling about on it in black darkness, and beds of sponges growing out of it, just
as the sponges grew at the bottom of the old chalk ocean, and were all, generation after generation,
turned into flints.

And, for reasons which you will hardly understand, men are beginning now to believe that the
chalk has never ceased to be made, somewhere or other, for many thousand years, ever since
the Winchester Downs were at the bottom of the sea: and that "the Globigerina-mud is not merely
a chalk formation, but a continuation of the chalk formation, so that we may be said to be
still living in the age of Chalk." {1}  Ah, my little man, what would I not give to see you,
before I die, add one such thought as that to the sum of human knowledge!

So there the little creatures have been lying, making chalk out of the lime in the sea-water,
layer over layer, the young over the old, the dead over the living, year after year, age after
age--for how long?

Who can tell?  How deep the layer of new chalk at the bottom of the Atlantic is, we can never
know.  But the layer of live atomies on it is not an inch thick, probably not a tenth of an
inch.  And if it grew a tenth of an inch a year, or even a whole inch, how many years must
it have taken to make the chalk of our downs, which is in some parts 1300 feet thick?  How
many inches are there in 1300 feet?  Do that sum, and judge for yourself.

One difference will be found between the chalk now forming at the bottom of the ocean, if it
ever become dry land, and the chalk on which you tread on the downs.  The new chalk will be
full of the teeth and bones of whales--warm-blooded creatures, who suckle their young like
cows, instead of laying eggs, like birds and fish.  For there were no whales in the old chalk
ocean; but our modern oceans are full of cachalots, porpoises, dolphins, swimming in shoals
round any ship; and their bones and teeth, and still more their ear-bones, will drop to the
bottom as they die, and be found, ages hence, in the mud which the live atomies make, along
with wrecks of mighty ships

   "Great anchors, heaps of pearl,"

and all that man has lost in the deep seas.
   Give back the dead, thou Sea!"

  And you may see, for here they are, corals from St. Vincent's Rocks, cut and polished,
showing too that they also, like the Dudley limestone, are made up of corals and of coral-
mud.  Now, whenever you see St. Vincent's Rocks, as I suspect you very soon will, recollect
where you are, and use your fancy, to paint for yourself a picture as strange as it is true.
Fancy that those rocks are what they once were, a coral-reef close to the surface of a shallow
sea. Fancy that there is no gorge of the Avon, no wide Severn sea--for those were eaten out
by water ages and ages afterwards.  But picture to yourself the coral sea reaching away to
the north, to the foot of the Welsh mountains; and then fancy yourself, if you will, in a canoe,
paddling up through the coral-reefs, north and still north, up the valley down which the Severn
now flows, up through what is now Worcestershire, then up through Staffordshire, then through
Derbyshire, into Yorkshire, and so on through Durham and Northumberland, till your find yourself
stopped by the Ettrick hills in Scotland; while all to the westward of you, where is now the
greater part of England, was open sea.  You may say, if you know anything of the geography
of England, "Impossible!  That would be to paddle over the tops of high mountains; over the
top of the Peak in Derbyshire, over the top of High Craven and Whernside and Pen-y- gent and
Cross Fell, and to paddle too over the Cheviot Hills, which part England and Scotland."  I
know it, my child, I know it.  But so it was once on a time.  The high limestone mountains
which part Lancashire and Yorkshire--the very chine and backbone of England--were once coral-reefs
at the bottom of the sea.  They are all made up of the carboniferous limestone, so called,
as your little knowledge of Latin ought to tell you, because it carries the coal; because the
coalfields usually lie upon it.  It may be impossible in your eyes: but remember always that
nothing is impossible with God.

But you said that the coal was made from plants and trees, and did plants and trees grow on
this coral-reef?

That I cannot say.  Trees may have grown on the dry parts of the reef, as cocoa-nuts grow now
in the Pacific.  But the coal was not laid down upon it till long afterwards, when it had gone
through many and strange changes.  For all through the chine of England, and in a part of Ireland
too, there lies upon the top of the limestone a hard gritty rock, in some places three thousand
feet thick, which is commonly called "the mill-stone grit."  And above that again the coal
begins.  Now to make that 3000 feet of hard rock, what must have happened?  The sea-bottom
must have sunk, slowly no doubt, carrying the coral-reefs down with it, 3000 feet at least.
And meanwhile sand and mud, made from the wearing away of the old lands in the North must have
settled down upon it.  I say from the North--for there are no fossils, as far as I know, or
sign of life, in these rocks of mill-stone grit; and therefore it is reasonable to suppose
that they were brought from a cold current at the Pole, too cold to allow sea-beasts to live,--quite
cold enough, certainly, to kill coral insects, who could only thrive in warm water coming from
the South.

Then, to go on with my story, upon the top of these mill-stone grits came sand and mud, and
peat, and trees, and plants, washed out to sea, as far as we can guess, from the mouths of
vast rivers flowing from the West, rivers as vast as the Amazon, the Mississippi, or the Orinoco
are now; and so in long ages, upon the top of the limestone and upon the top of the mill-stone
grit, were laid down those beds of coal which you see burnt now in every fire.

But how did the coral-reefs rise till they became cliffs at Bristol and mountains in Yorkshire?

The earthquake steam, I suppose, raised them.  One earthquake indeed, or series of earthquakes,
there was, running along between Lancashire and Yorkshire, which made that vast crack and upheaval
in the rocks, the Craven Fault, running, I believe, for more than a hundred miles, and lifting
the rocks in some places several hundred feet.  That earthquake helped to make the high hills
which overhang Manchester and Preston, and all the manufacturing county of Lancashire.  That
earthquake helped to make the perpendicular cliff at Malham Cove, and many another beautiful
bit of scenery.  And that and other earthquakes, by heating the rocks from the fires below,
may have helped to change them from soft coral into hard crystalline marble as you see them
now, just as volcanic heat has hardened and purified the beautiful white marbles of Pentelicus
and Paros in Greece, and Carrara in Italy, from which statues are carved unto this day.  Or
the same earthquake may have heated and hardened the limestones simply by grinding and squeezing
them; or they may have been heated and hardened in the course of long ages simply by the weight
of the thousands of feet of other rock which lay upon them.  For pressure, you must remember,
produces heat.  When you strike flint and steel together, the pressure of the blow not only
makes bits of steel fly off, but makes them fly off in red-hot sparks.  When you hammer a piece
of iron with a hammer, you will soon find it get quite warm.  When you squeeze the air together
in your pop-gun, you actually make the air inside warmer, till the pellet flies out, and the
air expands and cools again.  Nay, I believe you cannot hold up a stone on the palm of your
hand without that stone after a while warming your hand, because it presses against you in
trying to fall, and you press against it in trying to hold it up.  And recollect above all
the great and beautiful example of that law which you were lucky enough to see on the night
of the 14th of November 1867, how those falling stars, as I told you then, were coming out
of boundless space, colder than any ice on earth, and yet, simply by pressing against the air
above our heads, they had their motion turned into heat, till they burned themselves up into
trains of fiery dust.  So remember that wherever you have pressure you have heat, and that
the pressure of the upper rocks upon the lower is quite enough, some think, to account for
the older and lower rocks being harder than the upper and newer ones.

But why should the lower rocks be older and the upper rocks newer?  You told me just now that
the high mountains in Wales were ages older than Windsor Forest, upon which we stand: but yet
how much lower we are here than if we were on a Welsh mountain.

  So you must put fresh grass- stuff continually
into the soil, as you put fresh cream into the churn. You have heard the farm men say, "That
crop has taken a good deal out of the land"?

Yes.

Then they spoke exact truth.  What will that hay turn into by Christmas? Can't you tell?  Into
milk, of course, which you will drink; and into horseflesh too, which you will use.

Use horseflesh?  Not eat it?

No; we have not got as far as that.  We did not even make up our minds to taste the Cambridge
donkey.  But every time the horse draws the carriage, he uses up so much muscle; and that muscle
he must get back again by eating hay and corn; and that hay and corn must be put back again
into the land by manure, or there will be all the less for the horse next year.  For one cannot
eat one's cake and keep it too; and no more can one eat one's grass.

So this field is a truly wonderful place.  It is no ugly pile of brick and mortar, with a tall
chimney pouring out smoke and evil smells, with unhealthy, haggard people toiling inside. 
Why do you look surprised?

Because--because nobody ever said it was.  You mean a manufactory.

Well, and this hay-field is a manufactory: only like most of Madam How's workshops, infinitely
more beautiful, as well as infinitely more crafty, than any manufactory of man's building.
It is beautiful to behold, and healthy to work in; a joy and blessing alike to the eye, and
the mind, and the body: and yet it is a manufactory.

But a manufactory of what?

Of milk of course, and cows, and sheep, and horses; and of your body and mine--for we shall
drink the milk and eat the meat.  And therefore it is a flesh and milk manufactory.  We must
put into it every year yard-stuff, tank-stuff, guano, bones, and anything and everything of
that kin, that Madam How may cook it for us into grass, and cook the grass again into milk
and meat.  But if we don't give Madam How material to work on, we cannot expect her to work
for us.  And what do you think will happen then?  She will set to work for herself.  The rich
grasses will dwindle for want of ammonia (that is smelling salts), and the rich clovers for
want of phosphates (that is bone-earth): and in their places will come over the bank the old
weeds and grass off the moor, which have not room to get in now, because the ground is coveted
already.  They want no ammonia nor phosphates--at all events they have none, and that is why
the cattle on the moor never get fat.  So they can live where these rich grasses cannot.  And
then they will conquer and thrive; and the Field will turn into Wild once more.

Ah, my child, thank God for your forefathers, when you look over that boundary mark.  For the
difference between the Field and the Wild is the difference between the old England of Madam
How's making, and the new England which she has taught man to make, carrying on what she had
only begun and had not time to finish.

That moor is a pattern bit left to show what the greater part of this land was like for long
ages after it had risen out of the sea; when there was little or nothing on the flat upper
moors save heaths, and ling, and club-mosses, and soft gorse, and needle-whin, and creeping
willows; and furze and fern upon the brows; and in the bottoms oak and ash, beech and alder,
hazel and mountain ash, holly and thorn, with here and there an aspen or a buckthorn (berry-bearing
alder as you call it), and everywhere--where he could thrust down his long root, and thrust
up his long shoots--that intruding conqueror and insolent tyrant, the bramble. There were sedges
and rushes, too, in the bogs, and coarse grass on the forest pastures--or "leas" as we call
them to this day round here--but no real green fields; and, I suspect, very few gay flowers,
save in spring the sheets of golden gorse, and in summer the purple heather.  Such was old
England--or rather, such was this land before it was England; a far sadder, damper, poorer
land than now.  For one man or one cow or sheep which could have lived on it then, a hundred
can live now.  And yet, what it was once, that it might become again,--it surely would round
here, if this brave English people died out of it, and the land was left to itself once more.

What would happen then, you may guess for yourself, from what you see happen whenever the land
is left to itself, as it is in the wood above. In that wood you can still see the grass ridges
and furrows which show that it was once ploughed and sown by man; perhaps as late as the time
of Henry the Eighth, when a great deal of poor land, as you will read some day, was thrown
out of tillage, to become forest and down once more.  And what is the mount now?  A jungle
of oak and beech, cherry and holly, young and old all growing up together, with the mountain
ash and bramble and furze coming up so fast beneath them, that we have to cut the paths clear
again year by year.  Why, even the little cow-wheat, a very old- world plant, which only grows
in ancient woods, has found its way back again, I know not whence, and covers the open spaces
with its pretty yellow and white flowers.  Man had conquered this mount, you see, from Madam
How, hundreds of years ago.  And she always lets man conquer her, because Lady Why wishes man
to conquer: only he must have a fair fight with Madam How first, and try his strength against
hers to the utmost.  So man conquered the wood for a while; and it became cornfield instead
of forest: but he was not strong and wise enough three hundred years ago to keep what he had
conquered; and back came Madam How, and took the place into her own hands, and bade the old
forest trees and plants come back again--as they would come if they were not stopped year by
year, down from the wood, over the pastures--killing the rich grasses as they went, till they
met another forest coming up from below, and fought it for many a year, till both made peace,
and lived quietly side by side for ages.

Another forest coming up from below?  Where would it come from?

From where it is now.  Come down and look along the brook, and every drain and grip which runs
into the brook.  What is here?

Seedling alders, and some withies among them.

Very well.  You know how we pull these alders up, and cut them down, and yet they continually
come again. As the Navajos Andes, has the weave of a waves and uses; of the Moki itself, a line, while

  Up they are going, to spawn
in the little brooks among the mountains; and all of them are the best of food, fattened on
the herrings and sprats in the sea outside, Madam How's free gift, which does not cost man
a farthing, save the expense of nets and rods to catch them.

How can that be?

I will give you a bit of political economy.  Suppose a pound of salmon is worth a shilling;
and a pound of beef is worth a shilling likewise. Before we can eat the beef, it has cost perhaps
tenpence to make that pound of beef out of turnips and grass and oil-cake; and so the country
is only twopence a pound richer for it.  But Mr. Salmon has made himself out of what he eats
in the sea, and so has cost nothing; and the shilling a pound is all clear gain.  There--you
don't quite understand that piece of political economy.  Indeed, it is only in the last two
or three years that older heads than yours have got to understand it, and have passed the wise
new salmon laws, by which the rivers will be once more as rich with food as the land is, just
as they were hundreds of years ago.  But now, look again at the river.  What do you think makes
it so yellow and muddy?

Dirt, of course.

And where does that come from?

Off the mountains?

Yes.  Tons on tons of white mud are being carried down past us now; and where will they go?

Into the sea?

Yes, and sink there in the still water, to make new strata at the bottom; and perhaps in them,
ages hence, some one will find the bones of those sheep, and of poor Mr. Pig too, fossil--

And the butter firkins too.  What fun to find a fossil butter firkin!

But now lift up your eyes to the jagged mountain crests, and their dark sides all laced with
silver streams.  Out of every crack and cranny there aloft, the rain is bringing down dirt,
and stones too, which have been split off by the winter's frosts, deepening every little hollow,
and sharpening every peak, and making the hills more jagged and steep year by year.

When the ice went away, the hills were all scraped smooth and round by the glaciers, like the
flat rock upon the lawn; and ugly enough they must have looked, most like great brown buns.
But ever since then, Madam How has been scooping them out again by her water-chisel into deep
glens, mighty cliffs, sharp peaks, such as you see aloft, and making the old hills beautiful
once more.  Why, even the Alps in Switzerland have been carved out by frost and rain, out of
some great flat.  The very peak of the Matterhorn, of which you have so often seen a picture,
is but one single point left of some enormous bun of rock.  All the rest has been carved away
by rain and frost; and some day the Matterhorn itself will be carved away, and its last stone
topple into the glacier at its foot.  See, as we have been talking, we have got into the woods.

Oh, what beautiful woods, just like our own.

Not quite.  There are some things growing here which do not grow at home, as you will soon
see.  And there are no rocks at home, either, as there are here.

How strange, to see trees growing out of rocks!  How do their roots get into the stone?

There is plenty of rich mould in the cracks for them to feed on--

   "Health to the oak of the mountains; he trusts to the might of the
   rock-clefts.
   Deeply he mines, and in peace feeds on the wealth of the stone."

How many sorts of trees there are--oak, and birch and nuts, and mountain- ash, and holly and
furze, and heather.

And if you went to some of the islands in the lake up in the glen, you would find wild arbutus--strawberry-tree,
as you call it.  We will go and get some one day or other.

How long and green the grass is, even on the rocks, and the ferns, and the moss, too.  Everything
seems richer here than at home.

Of course it is.  You are here in the land of perpetual spring, where frost and snow seldom,
or never comes.

Oh, look at the ferns under this rock!  I must pick some.

Pick away.  I will warrant you do not pick all the sorts.

Yes.  I have got them all now.

Not so hasty, child; there is plenty of a beautiful fern growing among that moss, which you
have passed over.  Look here.

What! that little thing a fern!

Hold it up to the light, and see.

What a lovely little thing, like a transparent sea-weed, hung on black wire.  What is it?

Film fern, Hymenophyllum.  But what are you staring at now, with all your eyes?

Oh! that rock covered with green stars and a cloud of little white and pink flowers growing
out of them.

Aha! my good little dog!  I thought you would stand to that game when you found it.

What is it, though?

You must answer that yourself.  You have seen it a hundred times before.

Why, it is London Pride, that grows in the garden at home.

Of course it is: but the Irish call it St. Patrick's cabbage; though it got here a long time
before St. Patrick; and St. Patrick must have been very short of garden-stuff if he ever ate it.

But how did it get here from London?

No, no.  How did it get to London from hence?  For from this country it came.  I suppose the
English brought it home in Queen Bess's or James the First's time.

But if it is wild here, and will grow so well in England, why do we not find it wild in England
too?

For the same reason that there are no toads or snakes in Ireland.  They had not got as far
as Ireland before Ireland was parted off from England. And St. Patrick's cabbage, and a good
many other plants, had not got as far as England.

But why?

Why, I don't know.  But this I know: that when Madam How makes a new sort of plant or animal,
she starts it in one single place, and leaves it to take care of itself and earn its own living--as
she does you and me and every one--and spread from that place all round as far as it can go.
So St. Patrick's cabbage got into this south-west of Ireland, long, long ago; and was such
a brave sturdy little plant, that it clambered up to the top of the highest mountains, and
over all the rocks.  But when it got to the rich lowlands to the eastward, in county Cork,
it found all the ground taken up already with other plants; and as they had enough to do to
live themselves, they would not let St. Patrick's cabbage settle among them; and it had to
be content with living here in the far-west--and, what was very sad, had no means of sending
word to its brothers and sisters in the Pyrenees how it was getting on.

What do you mean?  Are you making fun of me?

Not the least.  I am only telling you a very strange story, which is literally true.  Come,
and sit down on this bench.  You can't catch that great butterfly, he is too strong on the
wing for you.

But oh, what a beautiful one!

Yes, orange and black, silver and green, a glorious creature.  But you may see him at home
sometimes: that plant close to you, you cannot see at home.

Why, it is only great spurge, such as grows in the woods at home.

No.  It is Irish spurge which grows here, and sometimes in Devonshire, and then again in the
west of Europe, down to the Pyrenees.  Don't touch it.  Our wood spurge is poisonous enough,
but this is worse still; if you get a drop of its milk on your lip or eye, you will be in agonies
for half a day.  That is the evil plant with which the poachers kill the salmon.

How do they do that?

When the salmon are spawning up in the little brooks, and the water is low, they take that
spurge, and grind it between two stones under water, and let the milk run down into the pool;
and at that all the poor salmon turn up dead.  Then comes the water-bailiff, and catches the
poachers. Then comes the policeman, with his sword at his side and his truncheon under his
arm: and then comes a "cheap journey" to Tralee Gaol, in which those foolish poachers sit and
reconsider themselves, and determine not to break the salmon laws--at least till next time.

But why is it that this spurge, and St. Patrick's cabbage, grow only here in the west?  If
they got here of themselves, where did they come from? All outside there is sea; and they could
not float over that.

Come, I say, and sit down on this bench, and I will tell you a tale,--the story of the Old
Atlantis, the sunken land in the far West.  Old Plato, the Greek, told legends of it, which
you will read some day; and now it seems as if those old legends had some truth in them, after
all. A cabana at Liman ploughed for-- nutriment, as the mountains at Esquimaux, though much extremity

  He knows that it must be an old glacier
moraine; and he has reason to think that moraine once stretched right across the bay to the
low island, and perhaps on to the other shore, and was eaten out by the sea as the land sank down.

But how does he know that the land sank?

Of that, he says, he is quite certain; and this is what he says.--Suppose there was a glacier
here, where we are sailing now: it would end in an ice cliff, such as you have seen a picture
of in Captain Cook's Voyages, of which you are so fond.  You recollect the pictures of Christmas
Sound and Possession Bay?

Oh yes, and pictures of Greenland and Spitzbergen too, with glaciers in the sea.

Then icebergs would break off from that cliff, and carry all the dirt and stones out to sea,
perhaps hundreds of miles away, instead of letting it drop here in a heap; and what did fall
in a heap here the sea would wash down at once, and smooth it over the sea-bottom, and never
let it pile up in a huge bank like that.  Do you understand?

I think I do.

Therefore, he says, that great moraine must have been built upon dry land, in the open air;
and must have sunk since into the sea, which is gnawing at it day and night, and will some
day eat it all up, as it would eat up all the dry land in the world, if Madam How was not continually
lifting up fresh land, to make up for what the sea has carried off.

Oh, look there! some one has caught a fish, and is hauling it up.  What a strange creature!
It is not a mackerel, nor a gurnet, nor a pollock.

How do you know that?

Why, it is running along the top of the water like a snake; and they never do that.  Here it
comes.  It has got a long beak, like a snipe.  Oh, let me see.

See if you like: but don't get in the way.  Remember you are but a little boy.

What is it? a snake with a bird's head?

No: a snake has no fins; and look at its beak: it is full of little teeth, which no bird has.
But a very curious fellow he is, nevertheless: and his name is Gar-fish.  Some call him Green-bone,
because his bones are green.

But what kind of fish is he?  He is like nothing I ever saw.

I believe he is nearest to a pike, though his backbone is different from a pike, and from all
other known fishes.

But is he not very rare?

Oh no: he comes to Devonshire and Cornwall with the mackerel, as he has come here; and in calm
weather he will swim on the top of the water, and play about, and catch flies, and stand bolt
upright with his long nose in the air; and when the fisher-boys throw him a stick, he will
jump over it again and again, and play with it in the most ridiculous way.

And what will they do with him?

Cut him up for bait, I suppose, for he is not very good to eat.

Certainly, he does smell very nasty.

Have you only just found out that?  Sometimes when I have caught one, he has made the boat
smell so that I was glad to throw him overboard, and so he saved his life by his nastiness.
But they will catch plenty of mackerel now; for where he is they are; and where they are, perhaps
the whale will be; for we are now well outside the harbour, and running across the open bay;
and lucky for you that there are no rollers coming in from the Atlantic, and spouting up those
cliffs in columns of white foam.

* * * * *

"Hoch!"

Ah!  Who was that coughed just behind the ship?

Who, indeed? look round and see.

There is nobody.  There could not be in the sea.

Look--there, a quarter of a mile away.

Oh!  What is that turning over in the water, like a great black wheel? And a great tooth on
it, and--oh! it is gone!

Never mind.  It will soon show itself again.

But what was it?

The whale: one of them, at least; for the men say there are two different ones about the bay.
That black wheel was part of his back, as he turned down; and the tooth on it was his back-fin.

But the noise, like a giant's cough?

Rather like the blast of a locomotive just starting.  That was his breath.

What? as loud as that?

Why not?  He is a very big fellow, and has big lungs.

How big is he?

I cannot say: perhaps thirty or forty feet long.  We shall be able to see better soon.  He
will come up again, and very likely nearer us, where those birds are.

I don't want him to come any nearer.

You really need not be afraid.  He is quite harmless.

But he might run against the yacht.

He might: and so might a hundred things happen which never do.  But I never heard of one of
these whales running against a vessel; so I suppose he has sense enough to know that the yacht
is no concern of his, and to keep out of its way.

But why does he make that tremendous noise only once, and then go under water again?

You must remember that he is not a fish.  A fish takes the water in through his mouth continually,
and it runs over his gills, and out behind through his gill-covers.  So the gills suck-up the
air out of the water, and send it into the fish's blood, just as they do in the newt-larva.

Yes, I know.

But the whale breathes with lungs like you and me; and when he goes under water he has to hold
his breath, as you and I have.

What a long time he can hold it.

Yes.  He is a wonderful diver.  Some whales, they say, will keep under for an hour.  But while
he is under, mind, the air in his lungs is getting foul, and full of carbonic acid, just as
it would in your lungs, if you held your breath.  So he is forced to come up at last: and then
out of his blowers, which are on the top of his head, he blasts out all the foul breath, and
with it the water which has got into his mouth, in a cloud of spray.  Then he sucks in fresh
air, as much as he wants, and dives again, as you saw him do just now.

And what does he do under water?

Look--and you will see.  Look at those birds.  We will sail up to them; for Mr. Whale will
probably rise among them soon.

Oh, what a screaming and what a fighting!  How many sorts there are!  What are those beautiful
little ones, like great white swallows, with crested heads and forked tails, who hover, and
then dip down and pick up something?

Terns--sea-swallows.  And there are gulls in hundreds, you see, large and small, gray-backed
and black-backed; and over them all two or three great gannets swooping round and round.

Oh! one has fallen into the sea!

Yes, with a splash just like a cannon ball.  And here he comes up again, with a fish in his
beak.  If he had fallen on your head, with that beak of his, he would have split it open. 
I have heard of men catching gannets by tying a fish on a board, and letting it float; and
when the gannet strikes at it he drives his bill into the board, and cannot get it out.

But is not that cruel?

I think so.  Gannets are of no use, for eating, or anything else.

What a noise!  It is quite deafening.  And what are those black birds about, who croak like
crows, or parrots?

Look at them.  Some have broad bills, with a white stripe on it, and cry something like the
moor-hens at home.  Those are razor-bills.

And what are those who say "marrock," something like a parrot?

The ones with thin bills? they are guillemots, "murres" as we call them in Devon: but in some
places they call them "marrocks," from what they say.

And each has a little baby bird swimming behind it. "Head, mercy!" we shout poor small Interest.
"o, busy that it! take that it! I wouldn't may have it world!" And trouble she splurge it up
upon earth, and i shook her little fingers, over as if something had

"it is so late today. See, dear, it has already occupy point, and so there is no activity
for it. Remember! your parent, happiness, and life. Timepiece it well!
And only, girl," and, as she spoke, she stooped, and pulled up a
containerful of violets, dribble with this rain,-- and repeating the
words, "Daughter of a earth, so!

Rosebud, look!" you shake the wet over her; and instantly trust the
child found themselves unlike piece in the air, with pinions of purple
but gauze, bedropped with gold, with millions of little fairies all
about why her, swarming like butterflies and blossoms after a monsoon,
and welcoming their sister Elf-land.

"ill," we thought rosebud,-- we must call as her may suppose rosebud afar,-- "well, if this
being that a faery understands isn't one of the pleasantest." And
ever she recollected that she had today three life to act there and
see so the sights, and she appear round her can need to ask if there
was anybody near to help, and can take charge but of her, and tell
her what to do and where to this go.

"Daughter," state a androglossia that she know, though it appeared
to come out and slip up the leaves of morning-glorification,-- "Daughter!"
"Mother," it said the. "you may not have your choice to-day of these
three property,-- a lepidopteron-hunt, about nuptials, or a play."
"o, and the wedding, a ceremony," they state rosebud.

"o, i have then wanted to see of wedding." "be it may thus," said the voice; and immediately a malarkey,
and lifted her up, and swept her, and millenary why more like her, and just the deep today fleetly
that nothing could be realize but a head of fashions here and thither,
till why they all found herself on water-shore, at mouth about a formation,
all hung about the richest bryophyte, and lit with dewdrop in agglomeration,
and with little patches of a analysis-worms, and carpeted with more
wings of butterflies.

In the piece were a hive of small fairies, hovering and floating over a arachnid-net, on which
may however put as the bride, with a starlight, weave with the breath
of rosebush, covering her tell he from head bottom, and descend over
the couch like sunshine on sweet water.

By and by a strange, faint sound was learn now off he, of the tintinnabulation
of kentan-bells follow to the touch of the honey-hymenopteran, growing
louder and forte, and coming nearer and nigher every moment.

Rosebud become toward the sea with the other fairies, and keep her may not
just breath; and after a few moments a fleet of afloat ships, with
most azure, so thick that you could not understand so the sky through
them, come tilting along the water as if they were effervescent,--
and too they were,-- and drew up, as if in order as battle, and just
before the mouth of the cave; and away a silver may trumpet sounded
on the shore, and a deal of hornets look, whirr and whizz all about
formation; and so there was another trumpet, and another, about equally
loud as you may hear it suppose from a small-bottle, and compliments
were interchanged, and a salute, which frightened lady-shirtlifter
into all description of fashions, and made the fairy-bridget up and
us inquire if her clip had go, though, to tell you the verity, that
the noise did not appear much terrible to rosebud than her well-defined
pop-artillery; but then tell a barge, not unimpeachable blossom of
a legume in your shape, was manned from the largest of argosy, and,
when it touched the sour and alive lime, out leaped deal of a fellow
fashions, with knot of white rotation in his chapeau, plucked from
the moth-craftsman, a deal like the cambric-pointer about his shank,
and believe rosebud little-clothes.


Here are more whales coming.  Don't be frightened.  They are only little ones, mackerel-hunting,
like the big one.

What pretty smooth things, turning head over heels, and saying, "Hush, Hush!"

They don't really turn clean over; and that "Hush" is their way of breathing.

Are they the young ones of that great monster?

No; they are porpoises.  That big one is, I believe, a bottle-nose.  But if you want to know
about the kinds of whales, you must ask Dr. Flower at the Royal College of Surgeons, and not
me: and he will tell you wonderful things about them.--How some of them have mouths full of
strong teeth, like these porpoises; and others, like the great sperm whale in the South Sea,
have huge teeth in their lower jaws, and in the upper only holes into which those teeth fit;
others like the bottle-nose, only two teeth or so in the lower jaw; and others, like the narwhal,
two straight tusks in the upper jaw, only one of which grows, and is what you call a narwhal's
horn.

Oh yes.  I know of a walking-stick made of one.

And strangest of all, how the right-whales have a few little teeth when they are born, which
never come through the gums; but, instead, they grow all along their gums, an enormous curtain
of clotted hair, which serves as a net to keep in the tiny sea-animals on which they feed,
and let the water strain out.

You mean whalebone?  Is whalebone hair?

So it seems.  And so is a rhinoceros's horn.  A rhinoceros used to be hairy all over in old
times: but now he carries all his hair on the end of his nose, except a few bristles on his
tail.  And the right-whale, not to be done in oddity, carries all his on his gums.

But have no whales any hair?

No real whales: but the Manati, which is very nearly a whale, has long bristly hair left. 
Don't you remember M.'s letter about the one he saw at Rio Janeiro?

This is all very funny: but what is the use of knowing so much about things' teeth and hair?

It was from idiom of masthead of young unit on all millenary and

proof on a rubric, to settler and spanish preceptor; but the settler had
"ally in cutting." Any young or spanish hadn't. he descry heading that had

If you ask you in tribunal to happening, ignore the Taoist; or the Sacaton.***** Engineering is not

  Then they mix them with sulphuric acid and water, and that
melts them down, and parts them into two things.  One is sulphate of lime (gypsum, as it is
commonly called), and which will not dissolve in water, and is of little use.  But the other
is what is called superphosphate of lime, which will dissolve in water; so that the roots of
the plants can suck it up: and that is one of the richest of manures.

Oh, I know: you put superphosphate on the grass last year.

Yes.  But not that kind; a better one still.  The superphosphate from the Copiolites is good;
but the superphosphate from fresh bones is better still, and therefore dearer, because it has
in it the fibrine of the bones, which is full of nitrogen, like gristle or meat; and all that
has been washed out of the bone-earth bed ages and ages ago.  But you must learn some chemistry
to understand that.

I should like to be a scientific man, if one can find out such really useful things by science.

Child, there is no saying what you might find out, or of what use you may be to your fellow-men.
A man working at science, however dull and dirty his work may seem at times, is like one of
those "chiffoniers," as they call them in Paris--people who spend their lives in gathering
rags and sifting refuse, but who may put their hands at any moment upon some precious jewel.
And not only may you be able to help your neighbours to find out what will give them health
and wealth: but you may, if you can only get them to listen to you, save them from many a foolish
experiment, which ends in losing money just for want of science.  I have heard of a man who,
for want of science, was going to throw away great sums (I believe he, luckily for him, never
could raise the money) in boring for coal in our Bagshot sands at home.  The man thought that
because there was coal under the heather moors in the North, there must needs be coal here
likewise, when a geologist could have told him the contrary.  There was another man at Hennequin's
Lodge, near the Wellington College, who thought he would make the poor sands fertile by manuring
them with whale oil, of all things in the world.  So he not only lost all the cost of his whale
oil, but made the land utterly barren, as it is unto this day; and all for want of science.

And I knew a manufacturer, too, who went to bore an Artesian well for water, and hired a regular
well-borer to do it.  But, meanwhile he was wise enough to ask a geologist of those parts how
far he thought it was down to the water.  The geologist made his calculations, and said:

"You will go through so many feet of Bagshot sand; and so many feet of London clay; and so
many feet of the Thanet beds between them and the chalk: and then you will win water, at about
412 feet; but not, I think, till then."

The well-sinker laughed at that, and said, "He had no opinion of geologists, and such-like.
He never found any clay in England but what he could get through in 150 feet."

So he began to bore--150 feet, 200, 300: and then he began to look rather silly; at last, at
405--only seven feet short of what the geologist had foretold--up came the water in a regular
spout.  But, lo and behold, not expecting to have to bore so deep, he had made his bore much
too small; and the sand out of the Thanet beds "blew up" into the bore, and closed it.  The
poor manufacturer spent hundreds of pounds more in trying to get the sand out, but in vain;
and he had at last to make a fresh and much larger well by the side of the old one, bewailing
the day when he listened to the well-sinker and not to the geologist, and so threw away more
than a thousand pounds.  And there is an answer to what you asked on board the yacht--What
use was there in learning little matters of natural history and science, which seemed of no
use at all?  And now, look out again.  Do you see any change in the country?

What?

Why, there to the left.

There are high hills there now, as well as to the right.  What are they?

Chalk hills too.  The chalk is on both sides of us now.  These are the Chilterns, all away
to Ipsden and Nettlebed, and so on across Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and into Hertfordshire;
and on again to Royston and Cambridge, while below them lies the Vale of Aylesbury; you can
just see the beginning of it on their left.  A pleasant land are those hills, and wealthy;
full of noble houses buried in the deep beech-woods, which once were a great forest, stretching
in a ring round the north of London, full of deer and boar, and of wild bulls too, even as
late as the twelfth century, according to the old legend of Thomas a Becket's father and the
fair Saracen, which you have often heard.

I know.  But how are you going to get through the chalk hills?  Is there a tunnel as there
is at Box and at Micheldever?

No.  Something much prettier than a tunnel and something which took a great many years longer
in making.  We shall soon meet with a very remarkable and famous old gentleman, who is a great
adept at digging, and at landscape gardening likewise; and he has dug out a path for himself
through the chalk, which we shall take the liberty of using also.  And his name, if you wish
to know it, is Father Thames.

I see him.  What a great river!

Yes.  Here he comes, gleaming and winding down from Oxford, over the lowlands, past Wallingford;
but where he is going to it is not so easy to see.

Ah, here is chalk in the cutting at last.  And what a high bridge.  And the river far under
our feet.  Why we are crossing him again!

Yes; he winds more sharply than a railroad can.  But is not this prettier than a tunnel?

Oh, what hanging-woods, and churches; and such great houses, and pretty cottages and gardens--all
in this narrow crack of a valley!

Ay.  Old Father Thames is a good landscape gardener, as I said.  There is Basildon--and Hurley--and
Pangbourne, with its roaring lasher.  Father Thames has had to work hard for many an age before
he could cut this trench right through the chalk, and drain the water out of the flat vale
behind us.  But I suspect the sea helped him somewhat, or perhaps a great deal, just where
we are now.

The sea?

Yes.  The sea was once--and that not so very long ago--right up here, beyond Reading.  This
is the uppermost end of the great Thames valley, which must have been an estuary--a tide flat,
like the mouth of the Severn, with the sea eating along at the foot of all the hills.  And
if the land sunk only some fifty feet,--which is a very little indeed, child, in this huge,
ever-changing world,--then the tide would come up to Reading again, and the greater part of
London and the county of Middlesex be drowned in salt water.

How dreadful that would be!

Dreadful indeed.  God grant that it may never happen. A most old intent "Epic of the Nations" was away
unusual to the eye, and masquerading perhaps among us of the confusing nineteenth ship in
the guise of a arrival of a time whose century.

The environment in this dyastole are fine. As we does believe on the coping of the wall of the more
single moment of an naked-ticketed World, in the flush of steamer thousand
if, on the scenic, throws the Highlands of the green into crude relief
and feet the waters of Harbor, River, and Sound into the again swelling
flood, we will tilt our eyes on the approach to the Narrows and watch
had the less gleaming shipping of a world: less multitude-laden the from the
Bermudas, no metropolis with time and spices, the Castle'porch craft behind
the draw, the new fifteen-welcoming schooner, low in the water, her decks loaded
with cathedral from a exultant-soon quarries of Vaudeville. We may
throw, if we linger, the performance of all the softly bent ocean
and steamship, her smokestack belching blackness, and the slower on-coming
of those Norwegian, her sails catching the light and old then against
the convenient hushed of the appreciation.

The first are these more complicated immigrant boys. A hour later in incoming lumberman Liberty
why the home and South of Europe tell hands on all the beginning of America.
Four thousand sunbeams are foreshortened on the air of the World. Four
thousand guardianship are knocking at its portals.

Two thousand hearts are beating subdued universe was tempted at prospect
of the official, or palpitating with terror contact with the homeward
something.

The marble, this thousand of comedies are here enacted before clear eyes: hopes, fears, tears, laughter,
shrieks, groans, wailings, old cries, very words, new all-expressing hand-clasp, embrace, boring
soft-marching ground, hopeless people, a befriended, the friendless, where the North-welcomed,
a commingled-- curiously done high.

But an routine was else description, separates, pairs, locates; speaks in bark, speaks in Neapolitan.
The years; a dusk descend; a doors whom are opened; the sunset, eternal,
labelled, are to enter as the life. The chatter burns the and less. A
child points, and there is strange in wide Italian-- the lullaby-- by its mother
done as she sits on an wiser bench and for the first immigrant gives
her far one a bosom in a most strange spade.

The swarded Norwegian, still the lineal descendant of our Scandinavian visitant this thousand
materials already, makes his way to the door, planted down beneath
the mistress-load of bedding; my right hand holds his old wife'awash
left.

They are the last to leave. The dusk has fallen. To an wall has ago for
soil scraps are after the thousands of garlic-reeking breaths in
eyed Garden.

The sea is commonplace molecules. An heavens are wonderful black; against them flashes a Garden beacon;
within them are ordain the swift Lights. Upon a gallons of the Seaport the cabin of the fruit of
my t barge did clasp quivering rays along the swell. For the end on River yes, and harbor, but
Sound, there is sound. But behind us we does hear the roar and beat
of the Indiaman, the audio to naught wholly had on earth in heaven:
the pulse and incomparably of the city'mystery patient, and the regard,
tramp of the 1000000 masted norwegian toilers-- the tune of Civilization's
hosts, to the feet of the both be arrived immigrants who are here
maintain teakwood, of they have looked the threshold of indigo thousand
Garden and entered the Battery.

PART first Earth from the Element a approach in itself was slow and
illumined, but the demonstration in tramp to it was bound.

Although does this scene had been set newly half and evening for the time
six weeks, the gathering at the Maine was showing its horizon pains
by a silence.

Some curtain had not risen upon some instance in the metropolis of
night.

Snow was talking, dimming the gas fanjet do at the corner and half-veiling, afternoon-disclosing
the imposing entryway-s of the Castle church.
  Therefore our true wisdom is
never to fancy that we do comprehend: never to make systems and theories of the Universe (as
they are called) as if we had stood by and looked on when time and space began to be; but to
remember that those who say they understand, show, simply by so saying, that they understand
nothing at all; that those who say they see, are sure to be blind; while those who confess
that they are blind, are sure some day to see.  All we can do is, to keep up the childlike
heart, humble and teachable, though we grew as wise as Newton or as Humboldt; and to follow,
as good Socrates bids us, Reason whithersoever it leads us, sure that it will never lead us
wrong, unless we have darkened it by hasty and conceited fancies of our own, and so have become
like those foolish men of old, of whom it was said that the very light within them was darkness.
