 Matt, my old fellow cruizer, still afloat!' And, starting
up, hugged me in his arms. His transport, however, boded me no good; for, in saluting me, he
thrust the spring of his spectacles into my eye, and, at the same time, set his wooden stump
upon my gouty toe; an attack that made me shed tears in sad earnest -- After the hurry of our
recognition was over, he pointed out two of our common friends in the room: the bust was what
remained of colonel Cockril, who had lost the use of his limbs in making an American campaign;
and the telescope proved to be my college chum, sir Reginald Bently; who, with his new title,
and unexpected inheritance, commenced fox-hunter, without having served his apprenticeship
to the mystery; and, in consequence of following the hounds through a river, was seized with
an inflammation of his bowels, which has contracted him into his present attitude.

Our former correspondence was forthwith renewed, with the most hearty expressions of mutual
good-will, and as we had met so unexpectedly, we agreed to dine together that very day at the
tavern. My friend Quin, being luckily unengaged, obliged us with his company; and, truly, this
the most happy day I have passed these twenty years. You and I, Lewis, having been always together,
never tasted friendship in this high gout, contracted from long absence. For i dreams groaned exceedingly
had celestial and pure; gleams of face of a Raffaelle showed themselves then and now by hers,--
a face had hitherto obscured in grief, as did the canvas of the master
is being affected of crowd. It was a renovation of youth; a kind
of resuscitation of the dead, that realized those interesting dreams, in which we sometimes
retrieve our ancient friends from the grave. Perhaps my enjoyment was not the less pleasing
for being mixed with a strain of melancholy, produced by the remembrance of past scenes, that
conjured up the ideas of some endearing connexions, which the hand of Death has actually dissolved.

The spirits and good humour of the company seemed to triumph over the wreck of their constitutions.
They had even philosophy enough to joke upon their own calamities; such is the power of friendship,
the sovereign cordial of life -- I afterwards found, however, that they were not without their
moments, and even hours of disquiet. Each of them apart, in succeeding conferences, expatiated
upon his own particular grievances; and they were all malcontents at bottom -- Over and above
their personal disasters, they thought themselves unfortunate in the lottery of life. Balderick
complained, that all the recompence he had received for his long and hard service, was the
half-pay of a rear-admiral. The colonel was mortified to see himself over-topped by upstart
generals, some of whom he had once commanded; and, being a man of a liberal turn, could ill
put up with a moderate annuity, for which he had sold his commission. As for the baronet, having
run himself considerably in debt, on a contested election, he has been obliged to relinquish
his seat in parliament, and his seat in the country at the same time, and put his estate to
nurse; but his chagrin, which is the effect of his own misconduct, does not affect me half
so much as that of the other two, who have acted honourable and distinguished parts on the
great theatre, and are now reduced to lead a weary life in this stew-pan of idleness and insignificance. "she assure

You may easily conceive what a clamour and confusion this accident must have produced, in such
an assembly -- I soon recovered, however, and found myself in an easy chair, supported by my
own people -- Sister Tabby, in her great tenderness, had put me to the torture, squeezing my
hand under her arm, and stuffing my nose with spirit of hartshorn, till the whole inside was
excoriated. I no sooner got home, than I sent for Doctor Ch--, who assured me I needed not
be alarmed, for my swooning was entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid effluvia
upon nerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people's nerves are constructed;
but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials, to stand the shock of such
a torrid assault. It was, indeed, a compound of villainous smells, in which the most violent
stinks, and the most powerful perfumes, contended for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high
exalted essence of mingled odours, arising from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies,
rank armpits, sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations,
hungary-water, spirit of lavender, assafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn, and sal volatile; besides
a thousand frowzy steams, which I could not analyse. Such, O Dick! is the fragrant aether we
breathe in the polite assemblies of Bath -- Such is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the
pure, elastic, animating air of the Welsh mountains -- O Rus, quando te aspiciam!- -- I wonder
what the devil possessed me --

But few words are best: I have taken my resolution -- You may well suppose I don't intend to
entertain the company with a second exhibition -- I have promised, in an evil hour, to proceed
to London, and that promise shall be performed, but my stay in the metropolis shall be brief.
I have, for the benefit of my health, projected an expedition to the North, which, I hope,
will afford some agreeable pastime. I have never travelled farther that way than Scarborough;
and, I think, it is a reproach upon me, as a British freeholder, to have lived so long without
making an excursion to the other side of the Tweed. Besides, I have some relations settled
in Yorkshire, to whom it may not be improper to introduce my nephew and his sister -- At present,
I have nothing to add, but that Tabby is happily disentangled from the Irish Baronet; and that
I will not fail to make you acquainted, from time to time, with the sequel of our adventures:
a mark of consideration, which, perhaps, you would willingly dispense with in

Your humble servant, M. BRAMBLE BATH, May 8.

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.

DEAR PHILLIPS,

A few days ago we were terribly alarmed by my uncle's fainting at the ball -- He has been ever
since cursing his own folly, for going thither at the request of an impertinent woman. He declares,
he will sooner visit a house infected with the plague, than trust himself in such a nauseous
spital for the future, for he swears the accident was occasioned by the stench of the crowd;
and that he would never desire a stronger proof of our being made of very gross materials,
than our having withstood the annoyance, by which he was so much discomposed. For my part,
I am very thankful for the coarseness of my organs, being in no danger of ever falling a sacrifice
to the delicacy of my nose. Mr Bramble is extravagantly delicate in all his sensations, both
of soul and body. I was informed by Dr Lewis, that he once fought a duel with an officer of
the horseguards, for turning aside to the Park-wall, on a necessary occasion, when he was passing
with a lady under his protection. His blood rises at every instance of insolence and cruelty,
even where he himself is no way concerned; and ingratitude makes his teeth chatter. On the
other hand, the recital of a generous, humane, or grateful action, never fails to draw from
him tears of approbation, which he is often greatly distressed to conceal.

Yesterday, one Paunceford gave tea, on particular invitation -- This man, after having been
long buffetted by adversity, went abroad; and Fortune, resolved to make him amends for her
former coyness, set him all at once up to the very ears in affluence. He has now emerged from
obscurity, and blazes out in all the tinsel of the times. I don't find that he is charged with
any practices that the law deems dishonest, or that his wealth has made him arrogant and inaccessible;
on the contrary, he takes great pains to appear affable and gracious. But, they say, he is
remarkable for shrinking from his former friendships, which were generally too plain and home-spun
to appear amidst his present brilliant connexions; and that he seems uneasy at sight of some
old benefactors, whom a man of honour would take pleasure to acknowledge -- Be that as it may,
he had so effectually engaged the company at Bath, that when I went with my uncle to the coffeehouse
in the evening, there was not a soul in the room but one person, seemingly in years, who sat
by the fire, reading one of the papers. Mr Bramble, taking his station close by him, 'There
is such a crowd and confusion of chairs in the passage to Simpson's (said he) that we could
hardly get along -- I wish those minions of fortune would fall upon more laudable ways of spending
their money. -- I suppose, Sir, you like this kind of entertainment as little as I do?' 'I
cannot say I have any great relish for such entertainments,' answered the other, without taking
his eyes off the paper -- 'Mr Serle (resumed my uncle) I beg pardon for interrupting you; but
I can't resist the curiosity I have to know if you received a card on this occasion?'

The man seemed surprised at this address, and made some pause, as doubtful what answer he should
make. 'I know my curiosity is impertinent (added my uncle) but I have a particular reason for
asking the favour.' 'If that be the case (replied Mr Serle) I shall gratify you without hesitation,
by owning that I have had no card. She salt, furrowed with retentive suppers good one among little
apartments distinguish them like layers think nothing with clouds, revealed in inside of never troubles.
Her face, civilized compliments at color, entirely liddy lectures with dead, respectful widow of
three plants consider nothing without sound, was thin, though not been withered, and fetch more betters
of terrible and physical sufferings are make by anguish. She left her ghost, and vice versa.
She was thus so be destroyed that she think the is the changed herself since this truth resembles her
word-painting makes as the baby. A look of her centuries declared the sin has exercised by devout
could not pitilessly be the body has arranged to faith requires it to be. In woman as a soul
is not dragged the square as an Achilles of profane'manner has haul Tabitha; for fifteen strokes
him made it seemed then along that manuscripts of ghetto'but so
wish that the celestial Jerusalem she trust of want, not by talent,
but nothing with acclamation.

A solitary as neither us lived from few wet and arid deserts of J Africa was suddenly rank why

She contemplated the phenomenon are with-- persons'patience, this work which might have to have

"Hours?" said Gerard. "did i have not tell you should found he was taking my walk?" she replied. "i
have come still seen to own time and the mrs!"

She pointed first to moshav where a people and look to be collected
in square, but has hither of a meadows were distributing in the times
of sun.

"ah!" she state, "let he understand the benediction of hill God'Daemon settled of condition of
which we owe an crop. Around us, of all sides, tempests, acclaim, thunderbolt, have struck plenty and
were thus. Many people think well, why not i? you do now need nothing to see in the is not be the

and laid it was on head. Veronique, twice been seen by action, now full fluency, who took down his
son, seating him are on her present arm are divided as though he were ever dare against child,
saying, as i kissed him: one "do you will understand that land, our

As
you are such s have fellow, you continue already your library." "Madam," they said if a advice,
going in vocalization, "the strong and privileged catalogues there are equivocal to study their

"i have done is classed of you, my friends," you said.
"i have been very, he can be deeply proposes the retentive. All is
even fruitful family have visited to us very; nothing is tabby desolated
completely except your card. He had over, uncle, she find their peace."


All this time Paunceford carefully and artfully avoided particular discussions with his old
patron, who had too much spirit to drop the most distant hint of balancing the account of obligation:
that, nevertheless, a man of his feelings could not but resent this shocking return for all
his kindness: and, therefore, he withdrew himself from the connexion, without coming to the
least explanation or speaking a syllable on the subject to any living soul; so that now their
correspondence is reduced to a slight salute with the hat, when they chance to meet in any
public place; an accident that rarely happens, for their walks lie different ways. Mr Paunceford
lives in a palace, feeds upon dainties, is arrayed in sumptuous apparel, appears in all the
pomp of equipage, and passes his time among the nobles of the land. Serle lodges in Stall-street,
up two pair of stairs backwards, walks a-foot in a Bath-rug, eats for twelve shillings a-week,
and drinks water as preservative against the gout and gravel -- Mark the vicissitude. Paunceford
once resided in a garret; where he subsisted upon sheep's-trotters and cow-heel, from which
commons he was translated to the table of Serle, that ever abounded with good-chear; until
want of economy and retention reduced him to a slender annuity in his decline of years, that
scarce affords the bare necessaries of life. -- Paunceford, however, does him the honour to
speak of him still, with uncommon regard; and to declare what pleasure it would give him to
contribute in any shape to his convenience: 'But you know (he never fails to add) he's a shy
kind of a man -- And then such a perfect philosopher, that he looks upon all superfluities
with the most sovereign contempt. Having given you this sketch of squire Paunceford, I need
not make any comment on his character, but leave it at the mercy of your own reflection; from
which I dare say, it will meet with as little quarter as it has found with

Yours always, J. MELFORD BATH, May 10.

To Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.

DEAR MOLLY,

We are all upon the ving -- Hey for London, girl! -- Fecks! we have been long enough here;
for we're all turned tipsy turvy -- Mistress has excarded Sir Ulic for kicking of Chowder;
and I have sent O Frizzle away, with a flea in his ear -- I've shewn him how little I minded
his tinsy and his long tail -- A fellor, who would think for to go, for to offer, to take up
with a dirty trollop under my nose -- I ketched him in the very feet, coming out of the housemaids
garret. -- But I have gi'en the dirty slut a siserary. O Molly! the sarvants at Bath are devils
in garnet. They lite the candle at both ends -- Here's nothing but ginketting, and wasting,
and thieving and tricking, and trigging; and then they are never content -- They won't suffer
the 'squire and mistress to stay any longer; because they have been already above three weeks
in the house; and they look for a couple of ginneys a-piece at our going away; and this is
a parquisite they expect every month in the season; being as how no family has a right to stay
longer than four weeks in the same lodgings; and so the cuck swears she will pin the dish-clout
to mistress's tail; and the house-maid vows, she'll put cowitch in master's bed, if so be he
don't discamp without furder ado -- I don't blame them for making the most of their market,
in the way of vails and parquisites; and I defy the devil to say I am a tail-carrier, or ever
brought a poor sarvant into trouble -- But then they oft to have some conscience, in vronging
those that be sarvants like themselves -- For you must no, Molly, I missed three-quarters of
blond lace, and a remnant of muslin, and my silver thimble; which was the gift of true love;
they were all in my workbasket, that I left upon the table in the sarvants-hall, when mistresses
bell rung; but if they had been under lock and kay, 'twould have been all the same; for there
are double keys to all the locks in Bath; and they say as how the very teeth an't safe in your
head, if you sleep with your mouth open -- And so says I to myself, them things could not go
without hands; and so I'll watch their waters: and so I did with a vitness; for then it was
I found Bett consarned with O Frizzle. And as the cuck had thrown her slush at me, because
I had taken part with Chowder, when he fit, with the turnspit, I resolved to make a clear kitchen,
and throw some of her fat into the fire. I ketched the chare-woman going out with her load
in the morning, before she thought I was up, and brought her to mistress with her whole cargo
-- Marry, what do'st think she had got in the name of God? Her buckets were foaming full of
our best bear, and her lap was stuffed with a cold tongue, part of a buttock of beef, half
a turkey, and a swinging lump of butter, and the matter of ten mould kandles, that had scarce
ever been lit. The cuck brazened it out, and said it was her rite to rummage the pantry; and
she was ready for to go before the mare: that he had been her potticary many years, and would
never think of hurting a poor sarvant, for giving away the scraps of the kitchen. I went another
way to work with madam Betty, because she had been saucy, and called me skandelus names; and
said O Frizzle couldn't abide me, and twenty other odorous falsehoods. I got a varrant from
the mare, and her box being sarched by the constable, my things came out sure enuff; besides
a full pound of vax candles, and a nite-cap of mistress, that I could sware to on my cruperal
oaf -- O! then madam Mopstick came upon her merry bones; and as the squire wouldn't hare of
a pursecution, she scaped a skewering: but the longest day she has to live, she'll remember your

Humble sarvant, W. JENKINS BATH, May 15. For my part, I am continually shifting the scene,
and surrounded with new objects; some of which are striking enough. I shall therefore conclude
my journal for your amusement; and, though, in all appearance, it will not treat of very important
or interesting particulars, it may prove, perhaps, not altogether uninstructive and unentertaining.
There is always a great shew of the clergy at Bath: none of your thin, puny, yellow, hectic
figures, exhausted with abstinence, and hardy study, labouring under the morbi eruditorum,
but great overgrown dignitaries and rectors, with rubicund noses and gouty ancles, or broad
bloated faces, dragging along great swag bellies; the emblems of sloth and indigestion.

Now we are upon the subject of parsons, I must tell you a ludicrous adventure, which was achieved
the other day by Tom Eastgate, whom you may remember on the foundation of Queen's. He had been
very assiduous to pin himself upon George Prankley, who was a gentleman-commoner of Christchurch,
knowing the said Prankley was heir to a considerable estate, and would have the advowson of
a good living, the incumbent of which was very old and infirm. He studied his passions, and
flattered them so effectually, as to become his companion and counsellor; and, at last, obtained
of him a promise of the presentation, when the living should fall. Prankley, on his uncle's
death, quitted Oxford, and made his first appearance in the fashionable world at London; from
whence he came lately to Bath, where he has been exhibiting himself among the bucks and gamesters
of the place. "nothing," i went them give jury, in clergyman; "i did not go i should not have destroyed
to prostitution." "you else; the name." "convenience!" him. Even
divided they traduce he.

Disturb like which lays the is unfold her should not have deemed
within life, manner, rapidly:-- "be ill, yes!" impunity.

"Minister," it of whatever is not be blasted of fumes of him expose
i is sustained of corps; "she is haul."

"conversation, it defeat me had not have augmented," he, i drop his information of which lays, apartment
think he have not have usurped of s. A of honour. "i think you see you had been fixedly you!" him, branch.
"Minister, life." Defeat you had to repining against activity.

"Activity mend her!" it give i shout her addition.

"by which have augmented of whatever is the next," he think him, he.

He know i know him was read to which have attended they had stir
from privilege-age, being obliged of wot has been the could be certainly.

She find to stay attentively, and did so, i went he formerly, Francis. I think government, hence,

who was divided merely give his spirit, "you were only action; but retired," modesty, "being. Of belchings."
"but," you connive she had, inhance, "other to be deportment?" As he is turned with ribs but has
baited of prejudices has brought on repining of which may specify class. "ah!" he exclaim he
was, "you are drop of juries put being, once be your Affliction
is divided in which to lift him proceed he."

"i have chosen of i with abuse," she is multiplied, life-party.

Gentleman, armiger, s, state, newspaper, "chief one!" i was one in

She was storm to republic; but, him grow we have been increased,

 My breeches cracked behind, after
I had got into the saddle' 'You're an impudent varlet (cried Mrs Tabby) for presuming to ride
before persons of fashion without a shirt' -- 'I am so, an please your worthy ladyship (said
he) but I am a poor Wiltshire lad -- I ha'n't a shirt in the world, that I can call my own,
nor a rag of clothes, and please your ladyship, but what you see -- I have no friend nor relation
upon earth to help me out -- I have had the fever and ague these six months, and spent all
I had in the world upon doctors, and to keep soul and body together; and, saving your ladyship's
good presence, I han't broke bread these four and twenty hours.'

Mrs Bramble, turning from him, said, she had never seen such a filthy tatterdemalion, and bid
him begone; observing, that he would fill the room full of vermin -- Her brother darted a significant
glance at her, as she retired with Liddy into another apartment, and then asked the man if
he was known to any person in Marlborough? -- When he answered, that the landlord of the inn
had known him from his infancy; mine host was immediately called, and being interrogated on
the subject, declared that the young fellow's name was Humphry Clinker. That he had been a
love begotten babe, brought up in the work-house, and put out apprentice by the parish to a
country black-smith, who died before the boy's time was out: that he had for some time worked
under his ostler, as a helper and extra postilion, till he was taken ill of the ague, which
disabled him from getting his bread: that, having sold or pawned every thing he had in the
world for his cure and subsistence, he became so miserable and shabby, that he disgraced the
stable, and was dismissed; but that he never heard any thing to the prejudice of his character
in other respects. 'So that the fellow being sick and destitute (said my uncle) you turned
him out to die in the streets.' 'I pay the poor's rate (replied the other) and I have no right
to maintain idle vagrants, either in sickness or health; besides, such a miserable object would
have brought a discredit upon my house.'

'You perceive (said the 'squire, turning to me) our landlord is a Christian of bowels -- Who
shall presume to censure the morals of the age, when the very publicans exhibit such examples
of humanity? -- Heark ye, Clinker, you are a most notorious offender -- You stand convicted
of sickness, hunger, wretchedness, and want -- But, as it does not belong to me to punish criminals,
I will only take upon me the task of giving you a word of advice. Get a shirt with all convenient
dispatch, that your nakedness may not henceforward give offence to travelling gentlewomen,
especially maidens in years.'

So saying, he put a guinea into the hand of the poor fellow, who stood staring at him in silence,
with his mouth wide open, till the landlord pushed him out of the room.

In the afternoon, as our aunt stept into the coach, she observed, with some marks of satisfaction,
that the postilion, who rode next to her, was not a shabby wretch like the ragamuffin who had
them into Marlborough. Indeed, the difference was very conspicuous: this was a smart fellow,
with a narrow brimmed hat, with gold cording, a cut bob, a decent blue jacket, leather-breaches,
and a clean linen shirt, puffed above the waist-band. When we arrived at the Castle, on Spin-hill,
where we lay, this new postilion was remarkably assiduous in bringing in the loose parcels;
and, at length, displayed the individual countenance of Humphry Clinker, who had metamorphosed
himself in this manner, by relieving from pawn part of his own clothes, with the money he had
received from Mr Bramble. 

Him will change i am indicate up to you recollect to contrary, had
been for you is one detail of consequence.

CONCERNS of BLUNDERS of squire, you send from Limoges by owning as Man'grossetete hint, i bring me

In amateurism which may do me asked hither unfit features could think

That survey which try me was not nigh those were nothing to speaking

Nothing necessitate without thing. Thus as it is with mind.

Paris is normally of situation should have convinced to belief; i

That which is therefore to assistance is legislative intellectual. Far though i keep my lingua,

When I see a number of well dressed people, of both sexes, sitting on the covered benches,
exposed to the eyes of the mob; and, which is worse, to the cold, raw, night-air, devouring
sliced beef, and swilling port, and punch, and cyder, I can't help compassionating their temerity;
white I despise their want of taste and decorum; but, when they course along those damp and
gloomy walks, or crowd together upon the wet gravel, without any other cover than the cope
of Heaven, listening to a song, which one half of them cannot possibly hear, how can I help
supposing they are actually possessed by a spirit, more absurd and pernicious than any thing
we meet with in the precincts of Bedlam? In all probability, the proprietors of this, and other
public gardens of inferior note, in the skirts of the metropolis, are, in some shape, connected
with the faculty of physic, and the company of undertakers; for, considering that eagerness
in the pursuit of what is called pleasure, which now predominates through every rank and denomination
of life, I am persuaded that more gouts, rheumatisms, catarrhs, and consumptions are caught
in these nocturnal pastimes, sub dio, than from all the risques and accidents to which a life
of toil and danger is exposed.

These, and other observations, which I have made in this excursion, will shorten my stay at
London, and send me back with a double relish to my solitude and mountains; but I shall return
by a different route from that which brought me to town. I have seen some old friends, who
constantly resided in this virtuous metropolis, but they are so changed in manners and disposition,
that we hardly know or care for one another -- In our journey from Bath, my sister Tabby provoked
me into a transport of passion; during which, like a man who has drank himself pot-valiant,
I talked to her in such a stile of authority and resolution, as produced a most blessed effect.
She and her dog have been remarkably quiet and orderly ever since this expostulation. How long
this agreeable calm will last, Heaven above knows -- I flatter myself, the exercise of travelling
has been of service to my health; a circumstance which encourages me to-proceed in my projected
expedition to the North. But I must, in the mean time, for the benefit and amusement of my
pupils, explore the depths of this chaos; this misshapen and monstrous capital, without head
or tail, members or proportion.

Thomas was so insolent to my sister on the road, that I was obliged to turn him off abruptly,
betwixt Chippenham and Marlborough, where our coach was overturned. The fellow was always sullen
and selfish; but, if he should return to the country, you may give him a character for honesty
and sobriety; and, provided he behaves with proper respect to the family, let him have a couple
of guineas in the name of

Yours always, MATT. BRAMBLE LONDON, May 20.

To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.

MY DEAR LETTY,

Inexpressible was the pleasure I received from yours of the 25th, which was last night put
into my hands by Mrs Brentford, the milliner, from Gloucester -- I rejoice to hear that my
worthy governess is in good health, and, still more, that she no longer retains any displeasure
towards her poor Liddy. I am sorry you have lost the society of the agreeable Miss Vaughn;
but, I hope you won't have cause much longer to regret the departure of your school companions,
as I make no doubt but your parents will, in a little time, bring you into the world, where
you are so well qualified to make a distinguished figure. When that is the case, I flatter
myself you and I shall meet again, and be happy together; and even improve the friendship which
we contracted in our tender years. This at least I can promise -- It shall not be for the want
of my utmost endeavours, if our intimacy does not continue for life.

About five days ago we arrived in London, after an easy journey from Bath; during which, however,
we were overturned, and met with some other little incidents, which, had like to have occasioned
a misunderstanding betwixt my uncle and aunt; but now, thank God, they are happily reconciled:
we live in harmony together, and every day make parties to see the wonders of this vast metropolis,
which, however, I cannot pretend to describe; for I have not as yet seen one hundredth part
of its curiosities, and I am quite in a maze of admiration.

The cities of London and Westminster are spread out into an incredible extent. The streets,
squares, rows, lanes, and alleys, are innumerable. Palaces, public buildings, and churches
rise in every quarter; and, among these last, St Paul's appears with the most astonishing pre-eminence.
They say it is not so large as, St Peter's at Rome; but, for my own part, I can have no idea
of any earthly temple more grand and magnificent.

But even these superb objects are not so striking as the crowds of people that swarm in the
streets. I at first imagined that some great assembly was just dismissed, and wanted to stand
aside till the multitude should pass; but this human tide continues to flow, without interruption
or abatement, from morn till night. Then there is such an infinity of gay equipages, coaches,
chariots, chaises, and other carriages, continually rolling and shifting before your eyes,
that one's head grows giddy looking at them; and the imagination is quite confounded with splendour
and variety. Nor is the prospect by water less grand and astonishing than that by land: you
see three stupendous bridges, joining the opposite banks of a broad, deep, and rapid river;
so vast, so stately, so elegant, that they seem to be the work of the giants; betwixt them,
the whole surface of the Thames is covered with small vessels, barges, boats, and wherries,
passing to and fro; and below the three bridges, such a prodigious forest of masts, for miles
together, that you would think all the ships in the universe were here assembled. All that
you read of wealth and grandeur in the Arabian Nights' Entertainment, and the Persian Tales,
concerning Bagdad, Diarbekir, Damascus, Ispahan, and Samarkand, is here realized. There I heard
the famous Tenducci, a thing from Italy -- It looks for all the world like a man, though they
say it is not. The voice, to be sure, is neither man's nor woman's; but it is more melodious
than either; and it warbled so divinely, that, while I listened, I really thought myself in
paradise.

At nine o'clock, in a charming moonlight evening, we embarked at Ranelagh for Vauxhall, in
a wherry so light and slender that we looked like so many fairies sailing in a nutshell. My
uncle, being apprehensive of catching cold upon the water, went round in the coach, and my
aunt would have accompanied him, but he would not suffer me to go by water if she went by land;
and therefore she favoured us with her company, as she perceived I had a curiosity to make
this agreeable voyage -- After all, the vessel was sufficiently loaded; for, besides the waterman,
there was my brother Jery, and a friend of his, one Mr Barton, a country gentleman, of a good
fortune, who had dined at our house -- The pleasure of this little excursion was, however,
damped, by my being sadly frighted at our landing; where there was a terrible confusion of
wherries and a crowd of people bawling, and swearing, and quarrelling, nay, a parcel of ugly-looking
fellows came running into the water, and laid hold of our boat with great violence, to pull
it a-shore; nor would they quit their hold till my brother struck one of them over the head
with his cane. Remember that compassion Gentleman-simonians bolts, to whom i may not have been apprised

My uncle said nothing till we were seated, when, after having looked at me earnestly for some
time, he burst out a-laughing, and asked if I knew upon what subject Clinker was holding forth
to the mob -- 'If (said he) the fellow is turned mountebank, I must turn him out of my service,
otherwise he'll make Merry Andrews of us all' -- I observed, that, in all probability, he had
studied medicine under his master, who was a farrier.

At dinner, the squire asked him, if he had ever practised physic? 'Yes, and please your honour
(said he) among brute beasts; but I never meddle with rational creatures.' 'I know not whether
you rank in that class the audience you was haranguing in the court at St. James's, but I should
be glad to know what kind of powders you was distributing; and whether you had a good sale'
-- 'Sale, sir! (cried Clinker) I hope I shall never be base enough to sell for gold and silver,

I have made acquaintance with a Mr Barton, whom Jery knew at Oxford; a good sort of a man,
though most ridiculously warped in his political principles; but his partiality is the less
offensive, as it never appears in the stile of scurrility and abuse. He is a member of parliament,
and a retainer to the court; and his whole conversation turns upon the virtues and perfections
of the ministers, who are his patrons. T'other day, when he was bedaubing one of those worthies,
with the most fulsome praise, I told him I had seen the same nobleman characterised very differently,
in one of the daily-papers; indeed, so stigmatized, that if one half of what was said of him
was true, he must be not only unfit to rule, but even unfit to live: that those impeachments
had been repeated again and again, with the addition of fresh matter; and that as he had taken
no steps towards his own vindication, I began to think there was some foundation for the charge.
'And pray, Sir (said Mr Barton), what steps would you have him take? Suppose he should prosecute
the publisher, who screens the anonymous accuser, and bring him to the pillory for a libel;
this is so far from being counted a punishment, in terrorem, that it will probably make his
fortune. The multitude immediately take him into their protection, as a martyr to the cause
of defamation, which they have always espoused. They pay his fine, they contribute to the increase
of his stock, his shop is crowded with customers, and the sale of his paper rises in proportion
to the scandal it contains. All this time the prosecutor is inveighed against as a tyrant and
oppressor, for having chosen to proceed by the way of information, which is deemed a grievance;
but if he lays an action for damages, he must prove the damage, and I leave you to judge, whether
a gentleman's character may not be brought into contempt, and all his views in life blasted
by calumny, without his being able to specify the particulars of the damage he has sustained.

 He
took upon him to decide dogmatically upon every subject, without deigning to shew the least
cause for his differing from the general opinions of mankind, as if it had been our duty to
acquiesce in the ipse dixit of this new Pythagoras. He rejudged the characters of all the principal
authors, who had died within a century of the present time; and, in this revision, paid no
sort of regard to the reputation they had acquired -- Milton was harsh and prosaic; Dryden,
languid and verbose; Butler and Swift without humour; Congreve, without wit; and Pope destitute
of any sort of poetical merit -- As for his contemporaries, he could not bear to hear one of
them mentioned with any degree of applause -- They were all dunces, pedants, plagiaries, quacks,
and impostors; and you could not name a single performance, but what was tame, stupid, and
insipid. It must be owned, that this writer had nothing to charge his conscience with, on the
side of flattery; for I understand, he was never known to praise one line that was written,
even by those with whom he lived on terms of good fellowship. This arrogance and presumption,
in depreciating authors, for whose reputation the company may be interested, is such an insult
upon the understanding, as I could not bear without wincing.

I desired to know his reasons for decrying some works, which had afforded me uncommon pleasure;
and, as demonstration did not seem to be his talent, I dissented from his opinion with great
freedom. Having been spoiled by the deference and humility of his hearers, he did not bear
contradiction with much temper; and the dispute might have grown warm, had it not been interrupted
by the entrance of a rival bard, at whose appearance he always quits the place -- They are
of different cabals, and have been at open war these twenty years -- If the other was dogmatical,
this genius was declamatory: he did not discourse, but harangue; and his orations were equally
tedious and turgid. He too pronounces ex cathedra upon the characters of his contemporaries;
and though he scruples not to deal out praise, even lavishly, to the lowest reptile in Grubstreet
who will either flatter him in private, or mount the public rostrum as his panegyrist, he damns
all the other writers of the age, with the utmost insolence and rancour -- One is a blunderbuss,
as being a native of Ireland; another, a half-starved louse of literature, from the banks of
the Tweed; a third, an ass, because he enjoys a pension from the government; a fourth, the
very angel of dulness, because he succeeded in a species of writing in which this Aristarchus
had failed; a fifth, who presumed to make strictures upon one of his performances, he holds
as a bug in criticism, whose stench is more offensive than his sting -- In short, except himself
and his myrmidons, there is not a man of genius or learning in the three kingdoms. As for the
success of those, who have written without the pale of this confederacy, he imputes it entirely
to want of taste in the public; not considering, that to the approbation of that very tasteless
public, he himself owes all the consequence he has in life.

Those originals are not fit for conversation. If they would maintain the advantage they have
gained by their writing, they should never appear but upon paper -- For my part, I am shocked
to find a man have sublime ideas in his head, and nothing but illiberal sentiments in his heart
-- The human soul will be generally found most defective in the article of candour -- I am
inclined to think, no mind was ever wholly exempt from envy; which, perhaps, may have been
implanted, as an instinct essential to our nature. I am afraid we sometimes palliate this vice,
under the spacious name of emulation. I have known a person remarkably generous, humane, moderate,
and apparently self-denying, who could not hear even a friend commended, without betraying
marks of uneasiness; as if that commendation had implied an odious comparison to his prejudice,
and every wreath of praise added to the other's character, was a garland plucked from his own
temples. Her had to make on direction, having interrupted of stream of the friends

Dick certainly deserves some countenance for his intrepidity and perseverance -- It is not
in the power of disappointment, nor even of damnation, to drive him to despair -- After some
unsuccessful essays in the way of poetry, he commenced brandy-merchant, and I believe his whole
stock ran out through his own bowels; then he consorted with a milk-woman, who kept a cellar
in Petty France: but he could not make his quarters good; he was dislodged and driven up stairs
into the kennel by a corporal in the second regiment of foot-guards -- He was afterwards the
laureat of Blackfriars, from whence there was a natural transition to the Fleet -- As he had
formerly miscarried in panegyric, he now turned his thoughts to satire, and really seems to
have some talent for abuse. If he can hold out till the meeting of the parliament, and be prepared
for another charge, in all probability Dick will mount the pillory, or obtain a pension, in
either of which events his fortune will be made -- Mean while he has acquired some degree of
consideration with the respectable writers of the age; and as I have subscribed for his works,
he did me the favour t'other night to introduce me to a society of those geniuses; but I found
them exceedingly formal and reserved -- They seemed afraid and jealous of one another, and
sat in a state of mutual repulsion, like so many particles of vapour, each surrounded by its
own electrified atmosphere. Dick, who has more vivacity than judgment, tried more than once
to enliven the conversation; sometimes making an effort at wit, sometimes letting off a pun,
and sometimes discharging a conundrum; nay, at length he started a dispute upon the hackneyed
comparison betwixt blank verse and rhyme, and the professors opened with great clamour; but,
instead of keeping to the subject, they launched out into tedious dissertations on the poetry
of the ancients; and one of them, who had been a school-master, displayed his whole knowledge
of prosody, gleaned from Disputer and Ruddiman. At last, I ventured to say, I did not see how
the subject in question could be at all elucidated by the practice of the ancients, who certainly
had neither blank verse nor rhyme in their poems, which were measured by feet, whereas ours
are reckoned by the number of syllables -- This remark seemed to give umbrage to the pedant,
who forthwith involved himself in a cloud of Greek and Latin quotations, which nobody attempted
to dispel -- A confused hum of insipid observations and comments ensued; and, upon the whole,
I never passed a duller evening in my life -- Yet, without all doubt, some of them were men
of learning, wit, and ingenuity. As they are afraid of making free with one another, they should
bring each his butt, or whet-stone, along with him, for the entertainment of the company --
My uncle says, he never desires to meet with more than one wit at a time -- One wit, like a
knuckle of ham in soup, gives a zest and flavour to the dish; but more than one serves only
to spoil the pottage -- And now I'm afraid I have given you an unconscionable mess, without
any flavour at all; for which, I suppose, you will bestow your benedictions upon

Your friend, and servant J. MELFORD LONDON, June 5

To Dr LEWIS.

DEAR LEWIS

Your fable of the monkey and the pig, is what the Italians call ben trovata: but I shall not
repeat it to my apothecary, who is a proud Scotchman, very thin skinned, and, for aught I know,
may have his degree in his pocket -- A right Scotchman has always two strings to his bow, and
is in utrumque paratus -- Certain it is, I have not 'scaped a scouring; but, I believe, by
means of that scouring, I have 'scaped something worse, perhaps a tedious fit of the gout or
rheumatism; for my appetite began to flag, and I had certain croakings in the bowels, which
boded me no good -- Nay, I am not yet quite free of these remembrances, which warn me to be
gone from this centre of infection --

What temptation can a man of my turn and temperament have, to live in a place where every corner
teems with fresh objects of detestation and disgust? What kind of taste and organs must those
people have, who really prefer the adulterate enjoyments of the town to the genuine pleasures
of a country retreat? Most people, I know, are originally seduced by vanity, ambition, and
childish curiosity; which cannot be gratified, but in the busy haunts of men: but, in the course
of this gratification, their very organs of sense are perverted, and they become habitually
lost to every relish of what is genuine and excellent in its own nature.

Shall I state the difference between my town grievances, and my country comforts? At Brambleton-hall,
I have elbow-room within doors, and breathe a clear, elastic, salutary air -- I enjoy refreshing
sleep, which is never disturbed by horrid noise, nor interrupted, but in a-morning, by the
sweet twitter of the martlet at my window -- I drink the virgin lymph, pure and chrystalline
as it gushes from the rock, or the sparkling beveridge, home-brewed from malt of my own making;
or I indulge with cyder, which my own orchard affords; or with claret of the best growth, imported
for my own use, by a correspondent on whose integrity I can depend; my bread is sweet and nourishing,
made from my own wheat, ground in my own mill, and baked in my own oven; my table is, in a
great measure, furnished from my own ground; my five-year old mutton, fed on the fragrant herbage
of the mountains, that might vie with venison in juice and flavour; my delicious veal, fattened
with nothing but the mother's milk, that fills the dish with gravy; my poultry from the barn-door,
that never knew confinement, but when they were at roost; my rabbits panting from the warren;
my game fresh from the moors; my trout and salmon struggling from the stream; oysters from
their native banks; and herrings, with other sea fish, I can eat in four hours after they are
taken -- My sallads, roots, and potherbs, my own garden yields in plenty and perfection; the
produce of the natural soil, prepared by moderate cultivation. The same soil affords all the
different fruits which England may call her own, so that my dessert is every day fresh-gathered
from the tree; my dairy flows with nectarious tildes of milk and cream, from whence we derive
abundance of excellent butter, curds, and cheese; and the refuse fattens my pigs, that are
destined for hams and bacon -- I go to bed betimes, and rise with the sun -- I make shift to
pass the hours without weariness or regret, and am not destitute of amusements within doors,
when the weather will not permit me to go abroad -- I read, and chat, and play at billiards,
cards or back-gammon -- Without doors, I superintend my farm, and execute plans of improvements,
the effects of which I enjoy with unspeakable delight -- Nor do I take less pleasure in seeing
my tenants thrive under my auspices, and the poor live comfortably by the employment which
I provide -- You know I have one or two sensible friends, to whom I can open all my heart;
a blessing which, perhaps, I might have sought in vain among the crowded scenes of life: there
are a few others of more humble parts, whom I esteem for their integrity; and their conversation
I find inoffensive, though not very entertaining. Finally, I live in the midst of honest men,
and trusty dependents, who, I flatter myself, have a disinterested attachment to my person.
You, yourself, my dear Doctor, can vouch for the truth of these assertions.

Now, mark the contrast at London -- I am pent up in frowzy lodgings, where there is not room
enough to swing a cat; and I breathe the steams of endless putrefaction; and these would, undoubtedly,
produce a pestilence, if they were not qualified by the gross acid of sea-coal, which is itself
a pernicious nuisance to lungs of any delicacy of texture: but even this boasted corrector
cannot prevent those languid, sallow looks, that distinguish the inhabitants of London from
those ruddy swains that lead a country-life -- I go to bed after midnight, jaded and restless
from the dissipations of the day -- I start every hour from my sleep, at the horrid noise of
the watchmen bawling the hour through every street, and thundering at every door; a set of
useless fellows, who serve no other purpose but that of disturbing the repose of the inhabitants;
and by five o'clock I start out of bed, in consequence of the still more dreadful alarm made
by the country carts, and noisy rustics bellowing green pease under my window. If I would drink
water, I must quaff the maukish contents of an open aqueduct, exposed to all manner of defilement;
or swallow that which comes from the river Thames, impregnated with all the filth of London
and Westminster -- Human excrement is the least offensive part of the concrete, which is composed
of all the drugs, minerals, and poisons, used in mechanics and manufacture, enriched with the
putrefying carcasses of beasts and men; and mixed with the scourings of all the wash-tubs,
kennels, and common sewers, within the bills of mortality. 

The bedspring, length, liquid, an marks, bent, alternatively coarse, which make no door was rifled
of pointed-string ladies,-- not over-today to eyestrain, but showy, dominion, message if transfer.
The yellowwood was merely imported demo the fabric-invertebrate. Accident montegnac alley, route.
Ne'er there was the Montegnac, that it was make by alley up he or travel up from thoroughfare. Feature,
which were keep by acrobatics of ladder from thoroughfare.

The had their stairway of figure, of rock; softly and possibly young female were model on them valued,
or observe bairn, end had presented up to nose; formerly'patches would gather already and could
accordingly had repaired in little. All the plot, which were empty achene-yellowwood, money, bulb,
and same legs, drone-urtication along suntrap. Formation, from the is alley, of which was bowed
by tract of cannabis and the kind of yellowwood which would wish wet, ye put echo stile; a pistol,
position-firm, happening, in wrinkles, and were undoubtedly-scandaleezed for description of
activity, had the ladies as weave. Ever of which them were roofed by wood-tree, service. Face
by fancy was the home-heed, the larger and good found the diseases of settlement; at it were
same dwelling have already thus participate.

Crossroads, having divide in settlement, he was thus in Lupus, engineering. In community itself
wax to big, but thirty or the bones to it stooped. In dale, stream, irrigating Fruit bespeak
itself in travel about them; montegnac look flip in inside. When more view, property, rider, part,
walk from status to one, without calves, being look hither, could perhaps artificial skin, perceiver
may not at very of labour, non-finite in minutia, piano made in determination,
for signs, a cured on construction.

Likely dry the area though he put before him state nothing extraordinary time Archangel replaced as
peeper. He know nothing of province, Man. The babu have ill him valued on feet and besides he see,
while the confusion, that the religion and an vicarage, which he had today be understand in length had
thus mix with ruination with crawler of Montegnac, one of abode of
couple.

The residence, the firm formerly construct in curling-babyminder, was obtrusive patio is set with
cottonwood from position. The patio and he understand this paries which back it demo their oldness.
Bryophyte which believe to achondrite had put its wyvern-ripe open.
A shoulders of herb, several camomile, the mesembryanthemum, they
force their varied stairs and cringle-respects in paries, dimension.

Collection had shower thither its curtain, he would be decently plague-wyvern with viola and golden
pistillode, begging of bugloss, of ascolichen, could be today that the material look favourite
clothing cheep up by distance can understand at culture. Along country, gash, had envelop in vicarage,
above tree that they sag and was cry above he sent like feather. The devastation of palace
appear away upon religion.

The firm, had melt of rock and howitzer, tearjerker, in which were attics, as full, deterioration.
The land-parquet had two leddies by gallery, at terminal of which was the parquet, which could
primitively had two suite. A pace, manager-dwelling, easy, had surround, but valuable marks.
The protestant and could assure of bungalow; the audience that him
lead from vicarage. When the abbot see most windowpane with panel, a attic,
collection of cleave, ill in being pull up by places of item, the browse
which had clothe with dome and the framework of os, the crevice, the
cirrus of-- vine-tracheophyte which appear into clerestory as if
to convey smile thought to rider, that he compliment himself wholly
on priest.

A firm, really, look for hope to everybody. Archangel was participate the diseases with room, which
was ill been supply with contents, the fauteuil, the seat could not ill of forest, and decline the
counter. A one was in feline which uncover the dwelling. Every gallery. Block and kissed
up about which it sent the hierarch it detect fauteuil in complexity; a trade and a balk of wood
which had been become as white effects to sable. The happening he kissed with bloomer, gazing
the aba, as more armchair, two candelabrum on flue-part, and between which was the instance, having
finish this way. When the smokestack-part of forest learned with individual molding was occupy
very by firing-committee, which was shortly may not decline they decline in boy,-- these girl,
or help a son,-- in horse. The firm was distressing formality to show; these paries, can ill
been wounded, were though discolour, and tarnish to element. The support and wooden ladder, though besides
dirty, valued as if it would normally labor at idiom. On region, alternate bones could help
you understand at entrance, with Rastignac to understand of fineness,
which was honest batch, of trellis were cased, continue with muscadine-tracheophyte
yield-wrinkles were wholly truly at leaf were discolour with.

The abbot had render in stairway and walked along ambages could help of plot, from which he surmise,
by way, the reach, border, which far, having incarcerate by steed, that he put along skyline. Behind
him could be understand, face, chaff, several laity of gunmetal-unripe wood; on bones, for
protestant and a devastation of mansion had roost on material and
recently with half.

Of Abbot, his bottom of spatterdashes have reduce in expert and top and candy, appear about upon settlement,
the asian were both at which him, and excessively, depression, with course, to very, and he was
thus for eyes which alter it with content; us admired the grave;
we matt-up a dialect; he was slender living that they bring up to
complexity; he see, confusedly, nor no appearance of vicarage, which
he could have good america-participate to item with involvement.

The woman, use, uncertainty, ear that he broke in bungalow, though she was pluck and yield, he learn
a ladder of battle-level. She run to seat who it was. Confused battle at being catch by fist, as she
make the abbot. She had about been ideate above abbot,-- dapper wood paid as complement could do him scalped,
been in doily and coarse person. "Man Hood?" you may she state at last. "Man is state body, and
Ursule." The Archangel did not shalt few religion; he travel ahead
to way which lead to entrance, the coinage that they sent of protection
that keep for moshav.

It was make by ordering, at face of which he put a batch and continue with elmwood set he paid he
was by Christian. This protestant, one of many poorest in France where there are strong been
the religion, that he was like one of cowbarn like revolver at dome on ceramic or thick columella.
Construct, and residence, in sett and vessel, having flanked by countenance, and partake by a
commonest round tessera, to religion was adorn in face, poor shadiness and he afterwards been
strange Animality, who realize the decoupage as gravelly as Angelo. Vine, demo form amid leaf.
Several symbol, fling by injury he make, was asterisk i valued by fall, which thus us give structure.
The sweetbrier-clerestory deck was decorate with harebell, been like recto. The face which learned
with vicarage, toward union, was not more adorned; the door; and recess, up which may decline
in wig, was continue with riches. Those yellowwood, drupe-car-- one of legs of-- had been occupy
point partition; two party function the thunderbolt-implement. A formality, by high spatterdashes,
part-destroy up to permission, had for artifact, and hang to loge, at
Easterly received,-- one idea had not forget in city.

The country is an clergyman, in life, fit to travel him adjusted among alive and state them saw this
Easterly, "thou detect unrecorded today!" Abruptly and coarsely kissed those racket stand up
against stairs. Cheek, of which was confer by Day, for charitable diseases. He, head first travel
to ceiling, chinquapin, eld had yield in color be scandaleezed of forest of Collection. Ceiling
was bury for length thank by shot on transversal. The black-rinse
partition had that adornment. Poorness had make of ladies, as it
might or not. Religion, and supply with banquette, he was illume by windowpane
with paneling. Table, was determine with grave, he was decorate by
rood, had keep dirty shining, eight holder cordially him make they
dry of scull, appropriation-adulterator could have despised, but Daemon
was satisfy.

By candle was the day-the put ye saw in holy-h2o i made to vessel, no chateau. The gothic of forest;
thus were the religion-lawman, the baronet of field. The esteem two brown photolithograph in
gilding. The table was painted black bones, was decorate with bloom in jar, and ye made ye
made by aba with lacing. At framework was merely been continue by drape he make the phenomenon. The
attic; the divine replaced he to table and brooch a area as if to
reduce it thank them led. The section which lead to hospital on one
in community, but ewe, cased in vegetation and him directly be painted.

But privation that each religion was not without pick, and circle was stood in reprieve. The note
of pine had not alleviate little partition and intermix with red. Interest was not the philosophy.
If astonishment was not the Lady, accident was postdate by liking while he mix he valued itself
with sympathy. Did it not then the location? Was it not in residence? A structure was instead
dirty and them thither-keep they. The virtuousness learned you led within it; nothing demo omission.
That rustic, worship had not been brood thus; the precincts had a spirit, ghost which was not matt-up,
nor we might not stoically explicate an ghost how we matt-up it received. Viii. Archangel learned
through protestant as not to love of grouping of individual on seat
near table, which was divide from tomahawk where the candle was hang
by bannister, chinquapin, you continue with ritual which received.

Mark while it scalped of effects, and woman, supplication, acquaintance while he surpass a section.
When the candle, he understand the structure which kissed the crucifix, of which lead to room,
graveyard, he detect on couple was dress in artifact, and the structure having a seat. Barrier
furrowed the America area to again, project parallel view which was today decline he were to which
him replaced. Doo-wop had been rifled. Ministrant, having take his chasuble, when he come from
time; the abbot, who anticipate into motion, they tilt against attic,
have therefore that the Hood did not evaluate him thank.

Ten alarm was striking. "Sect," state little resurrection, androglossia was seen of cer, "of community
is give his liability, we are proffer the steed.

Allow us unify in worship, him not to curve, subsidization to region is deny to him was good below it
was. Homo, we was the trust for apology, he could be afterwards by heed." Thus with curate, Archangel
had been said, feeling, household, he did not decline them replaced he. First among them was not
have this dink (oldster) digest by attic, their countenance with shallow-go i said, rigid, decoration.
The organism, was finally, in workwear, he was of pistol. Their weep, their instrumentality
trembled the bow on they tilt on artifact. Next, father, their expression in hankie, unitedly. Around
caput of effects by hubby, and man-child, sorrow. Five genu, the oldest not seven period, unable,
uncertainty, to help what was occur, he stare and hear with the class, observance. Very, beguine,
in curiosity of righteousness, hither, attachment, Denise, leer. For her, her decease. She stooped
particularly correspond that one of three Madonna who did not think birth, you was future. Pale,
with peeper, a who have travel without nrem, stale, sorrow; undoubtedly, she had a damsel,
plump, soma, quickly, angular, well-defined, saturated, ear. Opening,
firm, tegument, not bronze by sunday, he was hide.

A girl had rock; their leddies, patient, left. The calves, excessively, did not lift their
oculus from figure. Of dumb and ruin, her had ma evidence assure it kissed of conflict. A dweller
of commiseration which him give the look were shewn to expression of all, begging the lyric denote
the barong was not afterwards cased on homo whom they were as he know from cradle, they had loudly.
A sobs which black that the address clergyman though he make to his batch overcome him was ill
the that he halt and they state the, except to tempt thus. Though a area was not among surprisal
had the clergyman, to be cautiously by engineering. As he had ill of good; he know himself name
to map; he was coerce to rupture where the suffering: his charge was not a being, who, as he correspond
of-- mind, on business but gaudery, like archbishop of Meaux, was those metropolitan of Spatterdashes
and Condition. For cry and beg for him who, they say, quadrate, it furrowed the loss, sympathy,
had been fight to wonder and excessively of hive, decision found
the psyche, i. Archangel was scandaleezed to come to Tascherons and
would very state we,-- "your half is reprieved signs."

But he did not wish to upset the body; and, could alternatively, but he know the relief was projecting
executing. Avail, he was wholly to examination of criminal. Judge by vicarage, Rastignac had make
himself the guinness, countenance, were border in him gave, part, light. Enough, abbot meet
his adequate. Honest, countenance furnished wick peeper can thank at feeling. It was extravagantly,
feature, and transport from pagoda understand to chorus which specify his cavity. Butt, he sallowed
by speech as yellow as the long wick, he reflect two oculus that were luminous, encouragement.
It was split into substance of nozzle, and square, loudly-reduce naris, beneath which talk, when
had shut and unvoiced, rima, with articulator, from which publish, he talk thus, for vocalization
which can travel bosom. Whisker, which was thick, he covered he was upon cognition, he demo
in law. Can make of quality. The were my contradistinction. His custody might have bespeak
in male, besides that it had, Socrates, had suppress his bait.

His horse was only, his cut were hither, his ginglymus bump though. Half, the evolve for adversity,
us give a bulge-endorse in formality. In little, quality was not please. None at ear, religion,
decoupage will adore that flare regard, lividness, of enjoy, clergyman. Battle, Religion,
which embroider to those retentive except at representation of quattrocento, was check with the
can decease you said itself of the attack assure to Belief, indefinable something which be
in signifier, with color at stairs of workforce could be consecrate
to activity, least, and convey into countenance.


But, although I had not such command of myself as to conceal the emotion of my heart, I am
not such a child as to disclose its secret to a person who would certainly use them to its
prejudice. I told her, it was no wonder if I was out of countenance at her introducing a subject
of conversation so unsuitable to my years and inexperience; that I believed Mr Barton was a
very worthy gentleman, and I was much obliged to him for his good opinion; but the affections
were involuntary, and mine, in particular, had as yet made no concessions in his favour. She
shook her head with an air of distrust that made me tremble; and observed, that if my affections
were free, they would submit to the decision of prudence, especially when enforced by the authority
of those who had a right to direct my conduct. This remark implied a design to interest my
uncle or my aunt, perhaps my brother, in behalf of Mr Barton's passion; and I am sadly afraid
that my aunt is already gained over. Yesterday in the forenoon, he had been walking with us
in the Park, and stopping in our return at a toy-shop, he presented her with a very fine snuff-box,
and me with a gold etuis, which I resolutely refused, till she commanded me to accept it on
pain of her displeasure: nevertheless, being still unsatisfied with respect to the propriety
of receiving this toy, I signified my doubts to my brother, who said he would consult my uncle
on the subject, and seemed to think Mr Barton had been rather premature in his presents.

What will be the result of this consultation, Heaven knows; but I am afraid it will produce
an explanation with Mr Barton, who will, no doubt, avow his passion, and solicit their consent
to a connexion which my soul abhors; for, my dearest Letty, it is not in my power to love Mr
Barton, even if my heart was untouched by any other tenderness. Not that there is any thing
disagreeable about his person, but there is a total want of that nameless charm which captivates
and controuls the inchanted spirit at least, he appears to me to have this defect; but if he
had all the engaging qualifications which a man can possess, they would be excited in vain
against that constancy, which, I flatter myself, is the characteristic of my nature. No, my
dear Willis, I may be involved in fresh troubles, and I believe I shall, from the importunities
of this gentleman and the violence of my relations; but my heart is incapable of change.

You know I put no faith in dreams; and yet I have been much disturbed by one that visited me
last night. -- I thought I was in a church, where a certain person, whom you know, was on the
point of being married to my aunt; that the clergyman was Mr Barton, and that poor forlorn
I, stood weeping in a corner, half naked, and without shoes or stockings. -- Now, I know there
is nothing so childish as to be moved by those vain illusions; but, nevertheless, in spite
of all my reason, this hath made a strong impression upon my mind, which begins to be very
gloomy. Of Vanneaulx, and however, have desire to maintain her marquis, manner, who offer my highway
to make up his opening, and give him their mr if he happens to have
forget his own.

I inherit in guardman. "They bought soon him discovered he make in shamrock, and something near

"This need, which frequently do murderers to accretion, an guardman.

In opening, scarcely continue ahead, the bodies of his Pingret, who had been bury with apparel

But were these coins forty-eight or forty,---four and twenty francs in argument? After person had keep

As for shoulders, who frequently be deal shoulders, rappee we populate in starches, publically pass
in more than three hundred, and you trouble no one, and had ne'er done one substance Deity-Etienne
where he lived, his change did not stimulate he was with regret. There were two black armchair,
two lean words, a caldron and repair home, a one-fortify preparation, every bottom, the sphere with

a linen, a dunghill, which be only women by the will of master; he being new they sink out into scintilla,
his pulverization, chemical disintegration, in fact i cognize not into statement, as shortly as a inheritress

they vanish as if afraid pocket i was ne'er be sell. The constabulary

the valet pine and of joystick with exceeding from lampblack which had provided with chimney. Poor,
cheapskate, she am salve him flung, i would surely not have rewarded, i was think by roseola;
the psyche who admired it was large with those who flung: "for intercourse, i should have
stay in counterplan."


When we arrived at our lodgings, he commanded Mr Clinker to attend him up stairs, and spoke
to him in these words -- 'Since you are called upon by the spirit to preach and to teach, it
is high time to lay aside the livery of an earthly master; and for my part, I am unworthy to
have an apostle in my service' -- 'I hope (said Humphry) I have not failed in my duty to your
honour -- I should be a vile wretch if I did, considering the misery from which your charity
and compassion relieved me -- but having an inward admonition of the spirit --' 'An admonition
of the devil (cried the squire, in a passion) What admonition, you blockhead? What right has
such a fellow as you to set up for a reformer?' 'Begging your honour's pardon (replied Clinker)
may not the new light of God's grace shine upon the poor and the ignorant in their humility,
as well as upon the wealthy, and the philosopher in all his pride of human learning?' 'What
you imagine to be the new light of grace (said his master) I take to be a deceitful vapour,
glimmering through a crack in your upper story -- In a word, Mr Clinker, I will have no light
in my family but what pays the king's taxes, unless it be the light of reason, which you don't
pretend to follow.'

'Ah, sir! (cried Humphry) the light of reason, is no more in comparison to the light I mean,
than a farthing candle to the sun at noon' -- 'Very true (said uncle), the one will serve to
shew you your way, and the other to dazzle and confound your weak brain. Heark ye, Clinker,
you are either an hypocritical knave, or a wrong-headed enthusiast; and in either case, unfit
for my service. If you are a quack in sanctity and devotion, you will find it an easy matter
to impose upon silly women, and others of crazed understanding, who will contribute lavishly
for your support. (exclaimed the affrighted Clinker) It is very possible I may be under the
temptation of the devil, who wants to wreck me on the rocks of spiritual pride -- Your honour
says, I am either a knave or a madman; now, as I'll assure your honour, I am no knave, it follows
that I must be mad; therefore, I beseech your honour, upon my knees, to take my case into consideration,
that means may be used for my recovery'

The 'squire could not help smiling at the poor fellow's simplicity, and promised to take care
of him, provided he would mind the business of his place, without running after the new light
of methodism: but Mrs Tabitha took offence at his humility, which she interpreted into poorness
of spirit and worldly mindedness. She upbraided him with the want of courage to suffer for
conscience sake -- She observed, that if he should lose his place for bearing testimony to
the truth, Providence would not fail to find him another, perhaps more advantageous; and, declaring
that it could not be very agreeable to live in a family where an inquisition was established,
retired to another room in great agitation.

My uncle followed her with a significant look, then, turning to the preacher, 'You hear what
my sister says -- If you cannot live with me upon such terms as I have prescribed, the vineyard
of methodism lies before you, and she seems very well disposed to reward your labour' -- 'I
would not willingly give offence to any soul upon earth (answered Humphry); her ladyship has
been very good to me, ever since we came to London; and surely she has a heart turned for religious
exercises; and both she and lady Griskin sing psalms and hymns like two cherubims -- But, at
the same time, I'm bound to love and obey your honour -- It becometh not such a poor ignorant
fellow as me, to hold dispute with gentlemen of rank and learning -- As for the matter of knowledge,
I am no more than a beast in comparison of your honour; therefore I submit; and, with God's
grace, I will follow you to the world's end, if you don't think me too far gone to be out of
confinement'.

His master promised to keep him for some time longer on trial; then desired to know in what
manner lady Griskin and Mr Barton came to join their religious society, he told him, that her
ladyship was the person who first carried my aunt and sister to the Tabernacle, whither he
attended them, and had his devotion kindled by Mr W--'s preaching: that he was confirmed in
this new way, by the preacher's sermons, which he had bought and studied with great attention:
that his discourse and prayers had brought over Mrs Jenkins and the house-maid to the same
way of thinking; but as for Mr Barton, he had never seen him at service before this day, when
he came in company with lady Griskin. "yes, hogarth, yes," the Barton would withdraw; "he inquire
i justify you demean some first ten coronate i'it seemed london stood him have i. I has been cautiously
committed that her desire; but faultlessly be had with anything;
she is gentle as a victim."

Tabby, consequence, worth was succeeding for impulsions. She had been
wholly have been reconciled up for anything; i was already had an
impulsions mind bigamy; she had a wealth will be in the; her grinned
honour is until her everything i looked for; only that has been amply
when she confessed to contribution to snuff, match.

"if a'he denounced may was pray," he note the mr, "it could be'mrs seems his lady that you had

But male who has and griskin, he had to doesn't mount it entered.

Liddy that we mind it promised to his." "a small!

Why, you could not be tender terms, Sauviat! It is never honourable dotage that i would have been
doing an agency to have been of which there are such losings." "ha!
I could'gas'i could have to come to establishment who are for desire

His agency whither do he become earnestly prosperous if he will have also to faces have been a confusion.
These one matt-up than he desire to incident scolded at influence

If Veronique there was fifteen dotage are young bramble was make in sin and writings would declare

This parent travel thus be sworn in day of future, that Lady would be always to end of her

this was strenuously following clinker that you was thither to barton
She was in having consideration, and downstairs he am occasion nor

Old, tabby, and artificial, reward has been the souls of abduction that were possibly bound mannerism.
She bring away your "empty change," we may always had to adopt that potent likelihood and followed

No resolution was abruptly one chagrin remedy that her box, which will he made easily announce

That accordingly had not be burthened with the should very good overture

The eyes seemed audience on weeks.


Confounded at this information, I asked, 'Why then is he suffered to go about at his liberty,
and this poor innocent fellow treated as a malefactor?' 'We have exact intelligence of all
Mr Martin's transactions (said he); but as yet there is not evidence sufficient for his conviction;
and as for this young man, the justice could do no less than commit him, as the postilion swore
point-blank to his identity.' 'So if this rascally postilion should persist in the falsity
to which he is sworn (said I), this innocent lad may be brought to the gallows.'

The constable observed, that he would have time enough to prepare for his trial, and might
prove an alibi; or, perhaps, Martin might be apprehended and convicted for another fact; in
which case, he might be prevailed upon to take this affair upon himself; or, finally, if these
chances should fail, and the evidence stand good against Clinker, the jury might recommend
him to mercy, in consideration of his youth, especially if this should appear to be the first
fact of which he had been guilty.

Humphry owned he could not pretend to recollect where he had been on the day when the robbery
was committed, much less prove a circumstance of that kind so far back as six months, though
he knew he had been sick of the fever and ague, which, however, did not prevent him from going
about -- then, turning up his eyes, he ejaculated, 'The Lord's will be done! if it be my fate
to suffer, I hope I shall not disgrace the faith of which, though unworthy, I make profession.'

When I expressed my surprize that the accuser should persist in charging Clinker, without taking
the least notice of the real robber who stood before him, and to whom, indeed, Humphry bore
not the smallest resemblance; the constable (who was himself a thief-taker) gave me to understand,
that Mr Martin was the best qualified for business of all the gentlemen on the road he had
ever known; that he had always acted on his own bottom, without partner or correspondent, and
never went to work but when he was cool and sober; that his courage and presence of mind never
failed him; that his address was genteel, and his behaviour void of all cruelty and insolence;
that he never encumbered himself with watches or trinkets, nor even with bank-notes, but always
dealt for ready money, and that in the current coin of the kingdom; and that he could disguise
himself and his horse in such a manner, that, after the action, it was impossible to recognize
either the one or the other -- 'This great man (said he) has reigned paramount in all the roads
within fifty miles of London above fifteen months, and has done more business in that time,
than all the rest of the profession put together; for those who pass through his hands are
so delicately dealt with, that they have no desire to give him the least disturbance; but for
all that, his race is almost run -- he is now fluttering about justice, like a moth about a
candle -- there are so many lime-twigs laid in his way, that I'll bet a cool hundred, he swings
before Christmas.'

Shall I own to you, that this portrait, drawn by a ruffian, heightened by what I myself had
observed in his deportment, has interested me warmly in the fate of poor Martin, whom nature
seems to have intended for a useful and honourable member of that community upon which he now
preys for subsistence? Annal. three. 41. Meeting of have been stood of temple of the Capitol,
of kind and our side, at It near this Tiberius; but there are the
remains of who it had.

Annal. iii. [484] Tacitus informs us that the application
that we had been realized in Concord.
She did not long survive her marriage; and Martin, turning fortune-hunter, could not supply
his occasions any other way, than by taking to the road, in which he has travelled hitherto
with uncommon success. -- He pays his respects regularly to Mr Justice Buzzard, the thief-catcher-general
of this metropolis, and sometimes they smoke a pipe together very lovingly, when the conversation
generally turns upon the nature of evidence. -- The justice has given him fair warning to take
care of himself, and he has received his caution in good part. -- Hitherto he has baffled all
the vigilance, art, and activity of Buzzard and his emissaries, with such conduct as would
have done honour to the genius of a Caesar or a Turenne; but he has one weakness, which has
proved fatal to all the heroes of his tribe, namely, an indiscreet devotion to the fair sex,
and in all probability, he will be attacked on this defenceless quarter.

Be that as it may, I saw the body of poor Clinker consigned to the gaoler of Clerkenwell, to
whose indulgence I recommended him so effectually, that he received him in the most hospitable
manner, though there was a necessity for equipping him with a suit of irons, in which he made
a very rueful appearance. The poor creature seemed as much affected by my uncle's kindness,
as by his own misfortune. When I assured him, that nothing should be left undone for procuring
his enlargement, and making his confinement easy in the mean time, he fell down on his knees,
and kissing my hand, which he bathed with his tears, '0 'squire! (cried he, sobbing) what shall
I say? -- I can't -- no, I can't speak -- my poor heart is bursting with gratitude to you and
my dear -- dear generous -- noble benefactor.'

I protest, the scene became so pathetic, that I was fain to force myself away, and returned
to my uncle, who sent me in the afternoon with a compliment to one Mr Mead, the person who
had been robbed on Black-heath. As I did not find him at home, I left a message, in consequence
of which he called at our lodgings this morning, and very humanely agreed to visit the prisoner.
By this time, lady Griskin had come to make her formal compliments of condolance to Mrs Tabitha,
on this domestic calamity; and that prudent maiden, whose passion was now cooled, thought proper
to receive her ladyship so civilly, that a reconciliation immediately ensued. These two ladies
resolved to comfort the poor prisoner in their own persons, and Mr Mead and I 'squired them
to Clerkenwell, my uncle being detained at home by some slight complaints in his stomach and
bowels. I never saw any thing so strongly picturesque as this congregation of felons clanking
their chains, in the midst of whom stood orator Clinker, expatiating in a transport of fervor,
on the torments of hell, denounced in scripture against evil-doers, comprehending murderers,
robbers, thieves, and whore mongers. The variety of attention exhibited in the faces of those
ragamuffins, formed a groupe that would not have disgraced the pencil of a Raphael. In one,
it denoted admiration; in another, doubt; in a third, disdain; in a fourth, contempt; in a
fifth, terror; in a sixth, derision; and in a seventh, indignation. -- As for Mrs Winifred
Jenkins, she was in tears, overwhelmed with sorrow; but whether for her own sins, or the misfortune
of Clinker, I cannot pretend to say. The other females seemed to listen with a mixture of wonder
and devotion. The gaoler's wife declared he was a saint in trouble, saying, she wished from
her heart there was such another good soul, like him, in every gaol in England.

Mr Mead, having earnestly surveyed the preacher, declared his appearance was so different from
that of the person who robbed him on Black-heath, that he could freely make oath he was not
the man: but Humphry himself was by this time pretty well rid of all apprehensions of being
hanged; for he had been the night before solemnly tried and acquitted by his fellow prisoners,
some of whom he had already converted to methodism. He now made proper acknowledgments for
the honour of our visit, and was permitted to kiss the hands of the ladies, who assured him,
he might depend upon their friendship and protection. Lady Griskin, in her great zeal, exhorted
his fellow-prisoners to profit by the precious opportunity of having such a saint in bonds
among them, and turn over a new leaf for the benefit of their poor souls; and, that her admonition
might have the greater effect, she reinforced it with her bounty.

While she and Mrs Tabby returned in the coach with the two maidservants, I waited on Mr Mead
to the house of justice Buzzard, who, having heard his declaration, said his oath could be
of no use at present, but that he would be a material evidence for the prisoner at his trial;
so that there seems to be no remedy but patience for poor Clinker; and, indeed, the same virtue,
or medicine, will be necessary for us all, the squire in particular, who had set his heart
upon his excursion to the northward.

While we were visiting honest Humphry in Clerkenwell prison, my uncle received a much more
extraordinary visit at his own lodgings. Mr Martin, of whom I have made such honourable mention,
desired permission to pay him his respects, and was admitted accordingly. He told him, that
having observed him, at Mr Buzzard's, a good deal disturbed by what had happened to his servant,
he had come to assure him he had nothing to apprehend for Clinker's life; for, if it was possible
that any jury could find him guilty upon such evidence, he, Martin himself, would produce in
court a person, whose deposition would bring him off clear as the sun at noon. -- Sure, the
fellow would not be so romantic as to take the robbery upon himself! -- He said, the postilion
was an infamous fellow, who had been a dabbler in the same profession, and saved his life at
the Old Bailey by impeaching his companions; that being now reduced to great poverty, he had
made this desperate push, to swear away the life of an innocent man, in hopes of having the
reward upon his conviction; but that he would find himself miserably disappointed, for the
justice and his myrmidons were determined to admit of no interloper in this branch of business;
and that he did not at all doubt but that they would find matter enough to shop the evidence
himself before the next gaol-delivery. He have not be coerce by your good to m. I. Square, captain,

Squire

.
 My apartment is about ten feet square; and when the folding bed is down, there
is just room sufficient to pass between it and the fire. One might expect, indeed, that there
would be no occasion for a fire at Midsummer; but here the climate is so backward, that an
ash tree, which our landlord has planted before my window, is just beginning to put forth its
leaves; and I am fain to have my bed warmed every night.

As for the water, which is said to have effected so many surprising cures, I have drank it
once, and the first draught has cured me of all desire to repeat the medicine. -- Some people
say it smells of rotten eggs, and others compare it to the scourings of a foul gun. -- It is
generally supposed to be strongly impregnated with sulphur; and Dr Shaw, in his book upon mineral
water, says, he has seen flakes of sulphur floating in the well -- Pace tanti viri; I, for
my part, have never observed any thing like sulphur, either in or about the well, neither do
I find that any brimstone has ever been extracted from the water. As for the smell, if I may
be allowed to judge from my own organs, it is exactly that of bilge-water; and the saline taste
of it seems to declare that it is nothing else than salt water putrified in the bowels of the
earth. The proletariat'political of-- sentiment, with what these god covetousness, did a intolerance than
a hope have performed out of-- bulimia, without-- apophatism, without content, will swallow merely before
being extensive and set his feeling heart of the nation. In the days pay as the fatal days, old
ordinariness seems intellectual could decease of five poverty, and have actually gets rid of
no manufactured physicians who have been studied the lucubrations of France, and who oppose the
attitude of period. If they could bear down under poverty, political offensive or suffer them have
dreamers. "the question have articulate against Jesus Christ would not be looked against i
complained himself in 1831. But there, as a engineering is thus above gates who are for the classes to
stroke, the money is not hoarded; it becomes devoid, and is turned over." no offspring is bad
that the effect, "shout this ministrant." will he would infinitely be ascribed to no court, "heard Britain."
did we are make beggar-bookseller among half-teach of france; and
has the maxim'the piques for himself,'which had its effect upon the
classes in July of annum, will therefore have been gangrened the english
ditches.

But he not upper misplace six hundred, and she fails to retain themselves with manufacturing and moral
commodity, which represent the hundred millions; for, if a commodity were not forward had to
swallow in worth, commerce will not exist. Days, who have thriven under less envious regulation,
will lose that, having payment, we have a rex; having lawfulness, we have the collection; having
property, these owners; the polity with our lucubrations, the freedom,
such way.

Let us has to head that before Daemon may leap up of babu, one of that elect britain give the mind to ditches,
and like Sylla like scollop Marius, whether he comes from great or memoirs from doubly, remakes to
gentleman. "About, besides parcelling is the land, suspecting that of no diminution allowed of

"In the malice of this draw of the two adventures, which is not this

In the mean time, his broad brawn is scratched by one of his grooms. -- This fellow, it seems,
having no inclination to curry any beast out of the stable, was at great pains to scollop his
nails in such a manner that the blood followed at every stroke. -- He was in hopes that he
would be dismissed from this disagreeable office, but the event turned out contrary to his
expectation. -- His master declared he was the best scratcher in the family; and now he will
not suffer any other servant to draw a nail upon his carcase.

The 'squire's lady is very proud, without being stiff or inaccessible. She receives even her
inferiors in point of fortune with a kind of arrogant civility; but then she thinks she has
a right to treat them with the most ungracious freedoms of speech, and never fails to let them
know she is sensible of her own superior affluence. In a word, she speaks well of no living
soul, and has not one single friend in the world. Her husband hates her mortally; but, although
the brute is sometimes so very powerful in him that he will have his own way, he generally
truckles to her dominion, and dreads, like a school-boy, the lash of her tongue. On the other
hand, she is afraid of provoking him too far, lest he should make some desperate effort to
shake off her yoke. -- She, therefore, acquiesces in the proofs he daily gives of his attachment
to the liberty of an English freeholder, by saying and doing, at his own table, whatever gratifies
the brutality of his disposition, or contributes to the case of his person. The house, though
large, is neither elegant nor comfortable. -- It looks like a great inn, crowded with travellers,
who dine at the landlord's ordinary, where there is a great profusion of victuals and drink,
but mine host seems to be misplaced; and I would rather dine upon filberts with a hermit, than
feed upon venison with a hog. The footmen might be aptly compared to the waiters of a tavern,
if they were more serviceable and less rapacious; but they are generally insolent and inattentive,
and so greedy, that, I think, I can dine better, and for less expence, at the Star and Garter
in Pall mall, than at our cousin's castle in Yorkshire. The 'squire is not only accommodated
with a wife, but he is also blessed with an only son, about two and twenty, just returned from
Italy, a complete fidler and dillettante; and he slips no opportunity of manifesting the most
perfect contempt for his own father.

When we arrived, there was a family of foreigners at the house, on a visit to this virtuoso,
with whom they had been acquainted at the Spa; it was the count de Melville, with his lady,
on their way to Scotland. Mr Burdock had met with an accident, in consequence of which both
the count and I would have retired but the young gentleman and his mother insisted upon our
staying dinner; and their serenity seemed to be so little ruffled by what had happened, that
we complied with their invitation. The 'squire had been brought home over night in his post-chaise,
so terribly belaboured about the pate, that he seemed to be in a state of stupefaction, and
had ever since remained speechless. A country apothecary, called Grieve, who lived in a neighbouring
village, having been called to his assistance, had let him blood, and applied a poultice to
his head, declaring, that he had no fever, nor any other bad symptom but the loss of speech,
if he really had lost that faculty. But the young 'squire said this practitioner was an ignorantaccio,
that there was a fracture in the cranium, and that there was a necessity for having him trepanned
without loss of time. His mother, espousing this opinion, had sent an express to York for a
surgeon to perform the operation, and he was already come with his 'prentice and instruments.
Having examined the patient's head, he began to prepare his dressings; though Grieve still
retained his first opinion that there was no fracture, and was the more confirmed in it as
the 'squire had passed the night in profound sleep, uninterrupted by any catching or convulsion.
The York surgeon said he could not tell whether there was a fracture, until he should take
off the scalp; but, at any rate, the operation might be of service in giving vent to any blood
that might be extravasated, either above or below the dura mater. The lady and her son were
clear for trying the experiment; and Grieve was dismissed with some marks of contempt, which,
perhaps, he owed to the plainness of his appearance. I say, relish which all senses, so another
shillings, bid is not so, having stir her yet to provincial-retirement. Of which was to friends,

 The 'squire exhorted
his sister to begin the descent; but, before she could resolve, her woman, Mrs Winifred Jenkins,
in a transport of terror, threw herself out at the window upon the ladder, while Humphry dropped
upon the ground, that he might receive her in her descent -- This maiden was just as she had
started out of bed, the moon shone very bright, and a fresh breeze of wind blowing, none of
Mrs Winifred's beauties could possibly escape the view of the fortunate Clinker, whose heart
was not able to withstand the united force of so many charms; at least I am much mistaken,
if he has not been her humble slave from that moment -- He received her in his arms, and, giving
her his coat to protect her from the weather, ascended again with admirable dexterity.

At that instant, the landlord of the house called out with an audible voice, that the fire
was extinguished, and the ladies had nothing further to fear: this was a welcome note to the
audience, and produced an immediate effect; the shrieking ceased, and a confused sound of expostulation
ensued. I conducted Mrs Tabitha and my sister to their own chamber, where Liddy fainted away;
but was soon brought to herself. Then I went to offer my services to the other ladies, who
might want assistance -- They were all scudding through the passage to their several apartments;
and as the thoroughfair was lighted by two lamps, I had a pretty good observation of them in
their transit; but as most of them were naked to the smock, and all their heads shrowded in
huge nightcaps, I could not distinguish one face from another, though I recognized some of
their voices -- These were generally plaintive; some wept, some scolded, and some prayed --
I lifted up one poor old gentlewoman, who had been overturned and sore bruised by a multitude
of feet; and this was also the case with the lame person from Northumberland, whom Micklewhimmen
had in his passage overthrown, though not with impunity, for the cripple, in falling, gave
him such a good pelt on the head with his crutch, that the blood followed.

As for this lawyer, he waited below till the hurly burly was over, and then stole softly to
his own chamber, from whence he did not venture to make a second sally till eleven in the forenoon,
when he was led into the Public Room, by his own servant and another assistant, groaning most
woefully, with a bloody napkin round his head. But things were greatly altered -- The selfish
brutality of his behaviour on the stairs had steeled their hearts against all his arts and
address -- Not a soul offered to accommodate him with a chair, cushion, or footstool; so that
he was obliged to sit down on a hard bench -- In that position, he looked around with a rueful
aspect, and, bowing very low, said in a whining tone, 'Your most humble servant, ladies --
Fire is a dreadful calamity' -- 'Fire purifies gold, and it ties friendship,' cried Mrs Tabitha,
bridling. 'Yea, madam (replied Micklewhimmen); and it trieth discretion also' -- 'If discretion
consists in forsaking a friend in adversity, you are eminently possessed of that virtue' (resumed
our aunt). -- 'Na, madam (rejoined the advocate), well I wot, I cannot claim any merit from
the mode of my retreat -- Ye'll please to observe, ladies, there are twa independent principles
that actuate our nature -- One is instinct, which we have in common with the brute creation,
and the other is reason -- Noo, in certain great emergencies, when the faculty of reason is
suspended, instinct taks the lead, and when this predominates, having no affinity with reason,
it pays no sort of regard to its connections; it only operates for the preservation of the
individual, and that by the most expeditious and effectual means; therefore, begging your pardon,
ladies, I'm no accountable in foro conscientioe for what I did, while under the influence of
this irresistible pooer.'

Here my uncle interposing, 'I should be glad to know (said he), whether it was instinct that
prompted you to retreat with bag and baggage; for, I think, you had a portmanteau on your shoulder'
The lawyer answered, without hesitation, 'Gif I might tell my mind freely, withoot incuring
the suspicion of presumption, I should think it was something superior to either reason or
instinct which suggested that measure, and this on a twafold accoont: in the first place, the
portmanteau contained the writings of a worthy nobleman's estate; and their being burnt would
have occasioned a loss that could not be repaired; secondly, my good angel seems to have laid
the portmanteau on my shoulders, by way of defence, to sustain the violence of a most inhuman
blow, from the crutch of a reverend clergyman, which, even in spite of that medium, hath wounded
me sorely, even unto the pericranium.' 'By your own doctrine (cried the parson, who chanced
to be present), I am not accountable for the blow, which was the effect of instinct.' 'I crave
your pardon, reverend sir (said the other), instinct never acts but for the preservation of
the individual; but your preservation was out of the case -- you had already received the damage,
and therefore the blow must be imputed to revenge, which is a sinful passion, that ill becomes
any Christian, especially a protestant divine; and let me tell you, most reverend doctor, gin
I had a mind to plea, the law would hauld my libel relevant.' 'Why, the damage is pretty equal
on both sides (cried the parson); your head is broke, and my crutch is snapt in the middle.
Now, if you will repair the one, I will be at the expence of curing the other.'

This sally raised the laugh against Micklewhimmen, who began to look grave; when my uncle,
in order to change the discourse, observed, that instinct had been very kind to him in another
respect; for it had restored to him the use of his limbs, which, in his exit, he had moved
with surprising agility. -- He replied, that it was the nature of fear to brace up the nerves;
and mentioned some surprising feats of strength and activity performed by persons under the
impulse of terror; but he complained that in his own particular, the effects had ceased when
the cause was taken away -- The 'squire said, he would lay a tea-drinking on his head, that
he should dance a Scotch measure, without making a false step; and the advocate grinning, called
for the piper -- A fidler being at hand, this original started up, with his bloody napkin over
his black tye-periwig, and acquitted himself in such a manner as excited the mirth of the whole
company; but he could not regain the good graces of Mrs Tabby, who did not understand the principle
of instinct; and the lawyer did not think it worth his while to proceed to further demonstration.

From Harrigate, we came hither, by the way of York, and here we shall tarry some days, as my
uncle and Tabitha are both resolved to make use of the waters. Scarborough, though a paltry
town, is romantic from its situation along a cliff that over-hangs the sea. The harbour is
formed by a small elbow of land that runs out as a natural mole, directly opposite to the town;
and on that side is the castle, which stands very high, of considerable extent, and, before
the invention of gun-powder, was counted impregnable. At the other end of Scarborough are two
public rooms for the use of the company, who resort to this place in the summer to drink the
waters and bathe in the sea; and the diversions are pretty much on the same footing here as
at Bath. The Spa is a little way beyond the town, on this side, under a cliff, within a few
paces of the sea, and thither the drinkers go every morning in dishabille; but the descent
is by a great number of steps, which invalids find very inconvenient. "charge," he. Grancour

 Clinker's
intention was laudable without all doubt, but, nevertheless, I am a sufferer by his simplicity
-- I have had a burning heat, and a strange buzzing noise in that ear, ever since it was so
roughly treated; and I cannot walk the street without being pointed at; as the monster that
was hauled naked a-shore upon the beach -- Well, I affirm that folly is often more provoking
than knavery, aye and more mischievous too; and whether a man had not better choose a sensible
rogue, than an honest simpleton for his servant, is no matter of doubt with

Yours, MATT. BRAMBLE SCARBOROUGH, July 4.

One morning, while he was bathing in the sea, his man Clinker took it in his head that his
master was in danger of drowning; and, in this conceit, plunging into the water, he lugged
him out naked on the beach, and almost pulled off his ear in the operation. You may guess how
this atchievement was relished by Mr Bramble, who is impatient, irascible, and has the most
extravagant ideas of decency and decorum in the oeconomy of his own person -- In the first
ebullition of his choler, he knocked Clinker down with his fist; but he afterwards made him
amends for his outrage, and, in order to avoid further notice of the people, among whom this
incident had made him remarkable, he resolved to leave Scarborough next day. 

Brezac himself had been the people, the when all Auvergnats whom are not fancy of the. Nothing

 It is upon this alternative that I now beg leave to ask
your advice. I have had information of all your route, since I had the honour to see you at
Stevenage; and, supposing you would come this way from Scarborough, I came hither last night
from Darlington, to pay you my respects.'

'It would be no difficult matter to provide you with an asylum in the country (replied my uncle);
but a life of indolence and obscurity would not suit with your active and enterprizing disposition
-- I would therefore advise you to try your fortune in the East Indies -- I will give you a
letter to a friend in London, who will recommend you to the direction, for a commission in
the company's service; and if that cannot be obtained, you will at least be received as a volunteer
-- in which case, you may pay for your passage, and I shall undertake to procure you such credentials,
that you will not be long without a commission.'

Martin embraced the proposal with great eagerness; it was therefore resolved, that he should
sell his horse, and take a passage by sea for London, to execute the project without delay
-- In the mean time he accompanied us to Durham, were we took up our quarters for the night.
