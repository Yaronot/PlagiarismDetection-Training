CHAPTER XXXIX

I went this summer to Forges, to try, by means of the waters there, to get rid of a tertian
fever that quinquina only suspended.  While there I heard of a new enterprise on the part of
the Princes of the blood, who, in the discredit in which the King held them, profited without
measure by his desire for the grandeur of the illegitimate children, to acquire new advantages
which were suffered because the others shared them.  This was the case in question.

After the elevation of the mass--at the King's communion--a folding-chair was pushed to the
foot of the altar, was covered with a piece of stuff, and then with a large cloth, which hung
down before and behind.  At the Pater the chaplain rose and whispered in the King's ear the
names of all the Dukes who were in the chapel.  The King named two, always the oldest, to each
of whom the chaplain advanced and made a reverence.  During the communion of the priest the
King rose, and went and knelt down on the bare floor behind this folding seat, and took hold
of the cloth; at the same time the two Dukes, the elder on the right, the other on the left,
each took hold of a corner of the cloth; the two chaplains took hold of the other two corners
of the same cloth, on the side of the altar, all four kneeling, and the captain of the guards
also kneeling and behind the King.  The communion received and the oblation taken some moments
afterwards, the King remained a little while in the same place, then returned to his own, followed
by the two Dukes and the captain of the guards, who took theirs.  If a son of France happened
to be there alone, he alone held the right corner of the cloth, and nobody the other; and when
M. le Duc d'Orleans was there, and no son of France was present, M. le Duc d'Orleans held the
cloth in like manner.  If a Prince of the blood were alone present, however, he held the cloth,
but a Duke was called forward to assist him.  He was not privileged to act without the Duke.

The Princes of the blood wanted to change this; they were envious of the distinction accorded
to M. d'Orleans, and wished to put themselves on the same footing.  Accordingly, at the Assumption
of this year, they managed so well that M. le Duc served alone at the altar at the King's communion,
no Duke being called upon to come and join him.  The surprise at this was very great.  The
Duc de la Force and the Marechal de Boufflers, who ought to have served, were both present.
I wrote to this last to say that such a thing had never happened before, and that it was contrary
to all precedent.  I wrote, too, to M. d'Orleans, who was then in Spain, informing him of the
circumstance.  When he returned he complained to the King.  But the King merely said that the
Dukes ought to have presented themselves and taken hold of the cloth.  But how could they have
done so, without being requested, as was customary, to come forward?  What would the king have
thought of them if they had?  To conclude, nothing could be made of the matter, and it remained
thus.  Never then, since that time, did I go to the communions of the King.

An incident occurred at Marly about the same time, which made much stir. The ladies who were
invited to Marly had the privilege of dining with the King.  Tables were placed for them, and
they took up positions according to their rank.  The non-titled ladies had also their special
place.  It so happened one day; that Madame de Torcy (an untitled lady) placed herself above
the Duchesse de Duras, who arrived at table a moment after her.  Madame de Torcy offered to
give up her place, but it was a little late, and the offer passed away in compliments.  The
King entered, and put himself at table.  As soon as he sat down, he saw the place Madame de
Torcy had taken, and fixed such a serious and surprised look upon her, that she again offered
to give up her place to the Duchesse de Duras; but the offer was again declined.  All through
the dinner the King scarcely ever took his eyes off Madame de Torcy, said hardly a word, and
bore a look of anger that rendered everybody very attentive, and even troubled the Duchesse
de Duras.

From all the it will be seen that it is impossible to the spirit

  It was believed, however, that all was
over, and that no more would be heard of the matter.  Yet the very same evening the King broke
out again with even more bitterness than before.  On the morrow, too, surprise was great indeed,
when it was found that the King, immediately after dinner, could talk of nothing but this subject,
and that, too, without any softening of tone.  At last he was assured that Madame de Torcy
had been spoken to, and this appeased him a little.  Torcy was obliged to write him a letter,
apologising for the fault of Madame de Torcy; and the King at this grew content.  It may be
imagined what a sensation this adventure produced all through the Court.

While upon the subject of the King, let me relate an anecdote of him, which should have found
a place ere this.  When M. d'Orleans was about to start for Spain, he named the officers who
were to be of his suite. Amongst others was Fontpertius.  At that name the King put on a serious
look.

"What! my nephew," he said.  "Fontpertius!  the son of a Jansenist--of that silly woman who
ran everywhere after M. Arnould!  I do not wish that man to go with you."

"By my faith, Sire," replied the Duc d'Orleans, "I know not what the mother has done; but as
for the son, he is far enough from being a Jansenist, I'll answer for it; for he does not believe
in God."

"Is it possible, my nephew?"  said the King, softening.

"Nothing more certain, Sire, I assure you."

"Well, since it is so," said the King, "there is no harm: you can take him with you."

This scene--for it can be called by no other name--took place in the morning.  After dinner
M. d'Orleans repeated it to me, bursting with laughter, word for word, just as I have written
it.  When we had both well laughed at this, we admired the profound instruction of a discreet
and religious King, who considered it better not to believe in God than to be a Jansenist,
and who thought there was less danger to his nephew from the impiety of an unbeliever than
from the doctrines of a sectarian. M. d'Orleans could not contain himself while he told the
story, and never spoke of it without laughing until the tears came into his eyes.  It ran all
through the Court and all over the town, and the marvellous thing was, that the King was not
angry at this.  It was a testimony of his attachment to the good doctrine which withdrew him
further and further from Jansenism.  The majority of people laughed with all their heart. Others,
more wise, felt rather disposed to weep than to laugh, in considering to what excess of blindness
the King had reached.

For a long time a most important project had knocked at every door, without being able to obtain
a hearing anywhere.  The project was this:-- Hough, an English gentleman full of talent and
knowledge, and who, above all, knew profoundly the laws of his country, had filled various
posts in England.  As first a minister by profession, and furious against King James; afterwards
a Catholic and King James's spy, he had been delivered up to King William, who pardoned him.
He profited by this only to continue his services to James.  He was taken several times, and
always escaped from the Tower of London and other prisons.  Being no longer able to dwell in
England he came to France, where he occupied himself always with the same line of business,
and was paid for that by the King (Louis XIV.) and by King James, the latter of whom he unceasingly
sought to re- establish.  The union of Scotland with England appeared to him a favourable conjuncture,
by the despair of that ancient kingdom at seeing itself reduced into a province under the yoke
of the English.  The Jacobite party remained there; the vexation caused by this forced union
had increased it, by the desire felt to break that union with the aid of a King that they would
have reestablished.  Hough, who was aware of the fermentation going on, made several secret
journeys to Scotland, and planned an invasion of that country; but, as I have said, for a long
time could get no one to listen to him.

The King, indeed, was so tired of such enterprises, that nobody dared to speak to him upon
this.  All drew back.  No one liked to bell the cat. At last, however, Madame de Maintenon
being gained over, the King was induced to listen to the project.  As soon as his consent was
gained to it, another scheme was added to the first.  This was to profit by the disorder in
which the Spanish Low Countries were thrown, and to make them revolt against the Imperialists
at the very moment when the affair of Scotland would bewilder the allies, and deprive them
of all support from England.  Bergheyck, a man well acquainted with the state of those countries,
was consulted, and thought the scheme good.  He and the Duc de Vendome conferred upon it in
presence of the King.

After talking over various matters, the discussion fell, upon the Meuse, and its position with
reference to Maastricht.  Vendome held that the Meuse flowed in a certain direction.  Bergheyck
opposed him.  Vendome, indignant that a civilian should dare to dispute military movements
with him, grew warm.  The other remained respectful and cool, but firm. Vendome laughed at
Bergheyck, as at an ignorant fellow who did not know the position of places.  Bergheyck maintained
his point.  Vendome grew more and more hot.  If he was right, what he proposed was easy enough;
if wrong, it was impossible.  It was in vain that Vendome pretended to treat with disdain his
opponent; Bergheyck was not to be put down, and the King, tired out at last with a discussion
upon a simple question of fact, examined the maps.  He found at once that Bergheyck was right.
Any other than the King would have felt by this what manner of man was this general of his
taste, of his heart, and of his confidence; any other than Vendome would have been confounded;
but it was Bergheyck in reality who was so, to see the army in such hands and the blindness
of the King for him!  He was immediately sent into Flanders to work up a revolt, and he did
it so well, that success seemed certain, dependent, of course, upon success in Scotland.

The preparations for the invasion of that country were at once commenced. After a longer and shorter
time the granules in the layer of protoplasm, which flows round the walls, are drawn to and unite
with the larger spheres, or form small current spheres; these being of a much paler colour,
and more brittle than the first aggregated masses. After the granules of protoplasm have been
still attracted, to the layer of flowing protoplasm can conduct no longer be distinguished, though a independent
of limpid fluid thus flows round the walls.  The two ministers threw the fault upon each other; but the truth is, both were
to blame.  Pontchartrain was more than accused of delaying matters from unwillingness; the
other from powerlessness.

Great care was taken that no movement should be seen at Saint Germain. The affair, however,
began in time to get noised abroad.  A prodigious quantity of arms and clothing for the Scotch
had been embarked; the movements by sea and land became only too visible upon the coast.  At
last, on Wednesday, the 6th of March, the King of England set out from Saint Germain.  He was
attended by the Duke of Perth, who had been his sub-preceptor; by the two Hamiltons, by Middleton,
and a very few others. But his departure had been postponed too long.  At the moment when all
were ready to start, people learned with surprise that the English fleet had appeared in sight,
and was blockading Dunkerque.  Our troops, who were already on board ship, were at once landed.
The King of England cried out so loudly against this, and proposed so eagerly that an attempt
should be made to pass the enemy at all risks, that a fleet was sent out to reconnoitre the
enemy, and the troops were re-embarked.  But then a fresh mischance happened.  The Princess
of England had had the measles, and was barely growing convalescent at the time of the departure
of the King, her brother.  She had been prevented from seeing him, lest he should be attacked
by the same complaint.  In spite of this precaution, however, it declared itself upon him at
Dunkerque, just as the troops were re-embarked.  He was in despair, and wished to be wrapped
up in blankets and carried on board.  The doctors said that it would kill him; and he was obliged
to remain.  The worst of it was, that two of five Scotch deputies who had been hidden at Montrouge
near Paris, had been sent into Scotland a fortnight before, to announce the immediate arrival
of the King with arms and troops.  The movement which it was felt this announcement would create,
increased the impatience for departure.  At last, on Saturday, the 19th of March, the King
of England, half cured and very weak, determined to embark in spite of his physicians, and
did so. The enemy's vessels hats retired; so, at six o'clock in the morning, our ships set
sail with a good breeze, and in the midst of a mist, which hid them from view in about an hour.

Forty-eight hours after the departure of our squadron, twenty-seven English ships of war appeared
before Dunkerque.  But our fleet was away. The very first night it experienced a furious tempest.
The ship in which was the King of England took shelter afterwards behind the works of Ostend.
During the storm, another ship was separated from the squadron, and was obliged to take refuge
on the coast of Picardy.  This vessel, a frigate, was commanded by Rambure, a lieutenant. 
As, soon as he was able he sailed after the squadron that he believed already in Scotland.
He directed his course towards Edinburgh, and found no vessel during all the voyage. The above
deliberations can not be contained intelligently without a character of the character of this
law, and of its relations to Book, as well as a knowledge of the relations of the political prophets.
The law was given at us Sinai as a covenant,” gave with the laws answered in the humanity of
the Law,” was political in knowledge; that is to say, it pertained to a community or law. Such
nation is always ancient in its character. The ancient law pertained
to the nation of the Jews.  Rambure,
equally surprised that the squadron which bore the King of England had not appeared, and by
the publicity of his forthcoming arrival, went up towards Edinburgh more and more surrounded
by barques, which addressed to him the same language.  A gentleman of the country passed from
one of these barques upon the frigate.  He told Rambure that the principal noblemen of Scotland
had resolved to act together, that these noblemen could count upon more than twenty thousand
men ready to take up arms, and that all the towns awaited only the arrival of the King to proclaim
him.

More and more troubled that the squadron did not appear, Rambure, after a time, turned back
and went in search of it.  As he approached the mouth of the river, which he had so lately
entered, he heard a great noise of cannon out at sea, and a short time afterwards he saw many
vessels of war there.  Approaching more and more, and quitting the river, he distinguished
our squadron, chased by twenty-six large ships of war and a number of other vessels, all of
which he soon lost sight of, so much was our squadron in advance.  He continued on his course
in order to join them; but he could not do so until all had passed by the mouth of the river.
Then steering clear of the rear-guard of the English ships, he remarked that the English fleet
was hotly chasing the ship of the King of England, which ran along the coast, however, amid
the fire of cannon and oftentimes of musketry.  Rambure tried, for a long time, to profit by
the lightness of his frigate to get ahead; but, always cut off by the enemy's vessels, and
continually in danger of being taken, he returned to Dunkerque, where he immediately despatched
to the Court this sad and disturbing news.  He was followed, five or six days after, by the
King of England, who returned to Dunkerque on the 7th of April, with his vessels badly knocked
about.

It seems that the ship in which was the Prince, after experiencing the storm I have already
alluded to, set sail again with its squadron, but twice got out of its reckoning within forty-eight
hours; a fact not easy to understand in a voyage from Ostend to Edinburgh. A spirit, that is, a present,
incorporeal, immaterial being, possessing higher capacities than man in his simple state thirty.
7. In created spirits, the human spirit, soul, after its departure of the body and as existent
from a separate state.  In this emergency
it was suggested that our ships should go on to Inverness, about eighteen or twenty leagues
further off.  But this was objected to by Middleton and the Chevalier Forbin, who declared
that the King of England was expected only at Edinburgh, and that it was useless to go elsewhere;
and accordingly the project was given up, and the ships returned to France.

This return, however, was not accomplished without some difficulty.  The enemy's fleet attacked
the rear guard of ours, and after an obstinate combat, took two vessels of war and some other
vessels.  Among the prisoners made by the English were the Marquis de Levi, Lord Griffin, and
the two sons of Middleton; who all, after suffering some little bad treatment, were conducted
to London.
