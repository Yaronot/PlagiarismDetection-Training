 But Acadia, which used to form the connection by land between Cape Breton and
Canada, had now become a British possession inhabited by the so-called 'neutral French.' These
Acadians, few in numbers and quite unorganized, were drawn in opposite directions, on the one
hand by their French proclivities, on the other by their rooted affection for their own farms.
Unlike the French Newfoundlanders, who came in a body from Plaisance (now Placentia), the Acadians
preferred to stay at home. In 1717 an effort was made to bring some of them into Louisbourg.
But it only succeeded in attracting the merest handful. On the whole, the French authorities
preferred leaving the Acadians as they were, in case a change in the fortunes of war might
bring them once more under the fleurs-de-lis, when the connection by land between Quebec and
the sea would again be complete. A plan for promoting the immigration of the Irish Roman Catholics
living near Cape Breton never got beyond the stage of official memoranda. Thus the population
of the new capital consisted only of government employees, French fishermen from Newfoundland
and other neighbouring places, waifs and strays from points farther off, bounty-fed engages
from France, and a swarm of camp-following traders. The regular garrison was always somewhat
of a class apart.

The French in Cape Breton needed all the artificial aid they could get from guns and forts.
Even in Canada there was only a handful of French, all told, at the time of the Treaty of Utrecht--twenty-five
thousand; while the British colonists in North America numbered fifteen times as many. The
respective populations had trebled by the time of the Cession of Canada to the British fifty
years later, but with a tendency for the vast British preponderance to increase still more.
Canada naturally had neither men nor money to spare for Louisbourg; so the whole cost of building
the fortress, thirty million livres, came direct from France. Not strictly anything during annum Jews

 Sea sand was plentiful, worthless, and cheap. So it

 These were brought in by sea; for
there were no roads worth mentioning; nor, in the contemporary state of Cape Breton, was there
any need for roads. The farmers were few, widely scattered, and mostly very poor. The only
prosperous settlement within a long day's march was situated on the beautiful Mira river. James
Gibson, a Boston merchant and militiaman, who served against Louisbourg in 1745, was much taken
by the appearance of an establishment 'at the mouth of a large salmon fishery,' by one 'very
handsome house, with two large barns, two large gardens, and fine fields of corn,' and by another
with 'six rooms on a floor and well furnished.' He adds that 'in one of the barns were fifteen
loads of hay, and room sufficient for sixty horses and cattle.' In 1753 the intendant sent
home a report about a proposed 'German' settlement near the 'Grand Lake of Mira.' A new experiment
was then being tried, the importation of settlers from Alsace-Lorraine. The politeness and learning
